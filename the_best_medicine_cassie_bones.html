<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha Harkness just received some devastating news that sends her into a depression that she can't quite seem to get herself out of, even with the help of her oldest and dearest friend, Jen Kale.</p><p>So, on the advice of her doctor, Agatha attends a support group for women with her same illness. There, she meets Rio Vidal, a self-described "sit down comedian" who has a mischievous gleam in her eyes and an obvious interest in Agatha herself.</p><p>Agatha can't deny that she feels the spark there, too, but she doesn't know if now is the right time to start something with somebody, no matter how much chemistry they seem to have.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I've been thinking about writing this one for a while. There's not enough chronic illness rep in this (or many other) fandom. So I'm injecting a little bit of my own story to this. I hope you like it and, if you feel you can relate specifically to Agatha's struggle, I hope you know that you are seen and supported and definitely not alone.</p></blockquote>

      Chapter 1: FIve Senses
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">
<b>Chapter One</b>
</p><p>
<span>Her grandmother had always told her to focus on her five senses when she was nervous, so that’s what Agatha did as she sat waiting for the two minutes it took the doctor to enter the exam room.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hear.</span>
</em>
<span> She could hear the ticking of the clock over the door. It was off by about thirty seconds. Agatha’s time changed before the minute hand dragged itself across the blocky twelve at the top of the clock.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Smell</span>
</em>
<span>. It smelled like rubbing alcohol in this room, sterile in a way that tickled her nose. It didn’t burn her eyes, though, which was a plus. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>See</span>
</em>
<span>. She saw a lot of things. The walls in this room were light blue, probably in an attempt to comfort the patients. It was hard to be comforted in a place like this, though; this medical center was for a specific purpose. Nobody actually </span>
<em>
<span>wanted</span>
</em>
<span> to be in a place like this, she was certain. An infographic poster on the wall assured her that she was not alone, as three in four people diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis were female. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha Harkness had not yet been diagnosed, so there was still hope that she was here by accident. There was still hope that the MRI that had caught the white matter in her brain was a fluke. There was still hope that the doctor would walk into the room and apologize because this had all been a </span>
<em>
<span>huge</span>
</em>
<span> misunderstanding. Agatha Harkness did not have MS. She was a runner and an artist, a painter. The numbness that she had felt in her left side just a year ago was actually caused by the flu shot she’d received two weeks prior. It had returned to normal just two weeks after that, after all, after the ER doctors and her own primary care physician sent her to the neurologist just to be sure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had been dumb about the MRI order, she knew. She should have gotten it right away. But by the time she saw the neurologist with the gentle voice and the kind eyes, she had regained all feeling in her left hand. She could write and paint again with ease. She wasn’t stumbling over herself anymore. She was </span>
<em>
<span>fine</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d found the MRI order in a desk drawer in the summer, nearly nine months </span>
<em>
<span>after</span>
</em>
<span> it had been written up for her. It was good for up to a year. Agatha didn’t think it would yield any results, but she figured it couldn’t hurt just to schedule it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was obviously wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Taste</span>
</em>
<span>. She could still taste her coffee from that morning. She’d been out of oatmilk, so she had to drink it black. She tried to sweeten it with a couple packets of cane sugar she’d stolen from Dunkin, but it didn’t do much to take the bitter taste out of her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She really needed to stop drinking coffee: it made her anxiety infinitely worse.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Feel</span>
</em>
<span>. The exam bed underneath her was uncomfortable, the paper crinkling with every move she made. Agatha hated sitting still. She’d </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> hated it. She was a runner. She </span>
<em>
<span>needed</span>
</em>
<span> to run. It helped clear her mind, as if she could leave any and all thoughts behind her pounding feet on the pavement. She ran nearly every morning before dawn, pushing herself further and further and further…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Would she still be able to do that?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opened and she jumped slightly, looking up as an older woman with salt and pepper hair entered, a pair of glasses slipping down her nose. Her eyes were brown-hazel and her smile was kind. She sat down on the little moving stool, pushing herself towards Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello,” she said, “I’m Doctor Calderu. You must be Agatha Harkness.” She had a subtle Italian lilt to her accent. Agatha offered her a stiff smile, reaching out to shake her hand. “How are you doing today?” Dr. Calderu asked, tilting her head in genuine interest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “Honestly,” she said, “I’ve been better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu chuckled at that. “I bet,” she said. “It’s always a scary thing to be faced with a serious illness, but it doesn’t have to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I dunno,” Agatha said, looking down at her jean-clad knees. “MS seems like a pretty…</span>
<em>
<span>devastating</span>
</em>
<span> disease to possibly have. As far as I’ve seen, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It </span>
<em>
<span>can</span>
</em>
<span> be,” Dr. Calderu admitted. “But it doesn’t have to be. You seem rather physically fit, and your MRI scans aren’t </span>
<em>
<span>too</span>
</em>
<span> concerning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What does that even mean?” Agatha sighed. “Aren’t there lesions in my brain?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Dr. Calderu confirmed, “but they are new. This indicates that the disease may be at its earliest stages.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So I </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> have it, then?” Agatha felt her heart stutter in her chest, her breathing growing shallow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is indicated by your scans and other tests, yes,” Dr. Calderu said, “but I would like to perform a few more just to be certain. Is that okay?” Agatha nodded, fighting past the lump in her throat. “Okay,” the doctor said. She lifted her hands, palms facing Agatha. “Please push my hands away from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her hands and pushed Dr. Calderu’s away. Her hands were slender and soft. The doctor gave her a smile as Agatha easily pushed her hands away despite the doctor’s resisting effort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” she said, placing her fingers together as her palms now faced herself. “Now pull them towards you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tugged Dr. Calderu’s hands towards herself, and the doctor nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” she said. “A few more tests.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve already done these,” Agatha complained as the doctor instructed her to put her own hands up and resist </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> trying to push and pull them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But not with me,” Dr. Calderu said. “And when you did these tests with your other doctors, they were not looking for signs of MS, but rather for signs of stroke, which you thankfully did not have. Push up.” She placed her hand on Agatha’s knee, and Agatha lifted it against her palm. She knew that her legs were strong, muscular from her daily run. “Good,” she said. “Now stand and do as I say.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu had Agatha walk on her tiptoes, then on her heels, and Agatha stumbled a little bit, her face warming and her heart jumping. Was this a sign of MS? Could people without the disease do this kind of thing with ease? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She then had Agatha walk with her heel touching the toes of the other foot. This was also a bit of a challenge, but Agatha didn’t stumble at all this time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Dr. Calderu said, writing something down on her clipboard. “Sit back down and take off your shoes for me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had worn her Converse for the appointment. They weren’t her usual running shoes, but she liked the dark purple color and how they felt on her feet. Plus, they were easy to toe off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Socks, too,” the doctor requested, smiling at the </span>
<em>
<span>Starry Night</span>
</em>
<span>-inspired socks. Agatha toed them off as well, tucking them into her sneakers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu pulled out a tuning fork from the pocket of her lab coat. “I’m going to test the reflexes in your feet,” she explained. “I want you to look away while I do this. When you can no longer feel the vibrations, let me know. I will do this first on the right foot, then the left. Understand?” Agatha nodded. “Good. Look away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at the wall that had the infographic on it. She read it a couple times as she felt the vibrations in her foot slowly fade until she couldn’t feel anything anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said, turning back to the doctor, who nodded, writing something on her clipboard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Next foot,” Dr. Calderu, motioning for Agatha to turn away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, Agatha looked at the blank baby blue-colored wall. It was slightly textured, the paint job looking relatively new. She couldn’t smell the paint, though, so it couldn’t have been </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> new. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the buzzing in her left foot stopped, she said, “Okay” and looked back at the doctor again. The doctor nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Five seconds,” she said. “That is the difference between the time your right foot stops buzzing and your left foot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that…significant?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu stared at her, smiling, for five full seconds before she answered: “Yes.” Agatha nodded in understanding, her chest feeling tight again. “</span>
<em>
<span>But</span>
</em>
<span>,” the doctor continued, “it confirms my suspicions that your MS is in the </span>
<em>
<span>very </span>
</em>
<span>early stages. So long as we start treatment immediately, you should be perfectly fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Except for the fact that my central nervous system is going to be slowly shutting down for the rest of my life, you mean?” Agatha huffed, frowning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see you have been </span>
<em>
<span>Googling</span>
</em>
<span>,” Dr. Calderu chuckled. “That is fine. But you need to take everything you read on the internet with a grain of salt. Everybody’s experience is different, and treatment will slow the progression of the disease. You are </span>
<em>
<span>lucky</span>
</em>
<span> to have found this out now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t feel very lucky,” Agatha murmured, looking down at her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss Harkness…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Agatha corrected. She always hated being called by her last name. It connected her too much to her mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Dr. Calderu echoed. “You </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> lucky. Not to have developed this disease, of course, but that it was caught so early. This is almost </span>
<em>
<span>unheard of</span>
</em>
<span>. More often than not, I see patients who have already lost feeling in one or both of their legs, who need canes or even </span>
<em>
<span>wheelchairs</span>
</em>
<span>, who cannot walk more than twenty feet without losing their breath. So believe me when I say that you </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> lucky. Now that we’ve caught the MS, we can begin treatment and slow it down to a snail’s pace. I can’t promise you that you’ll never have a need for a mobility aid of some sort, but I </span>
<em>
<span>can</span>
</em>
<span> promise you that it’s a long way off. Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, tears still slipping down her cheeks as her heart continued to squeeze in her chest. Dr. Calderu handed her a tissue. Agatha blew her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How old are you?” the doctor asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Twenty-Nine,” Agatha said, sniffling. “This shouldn’t be happening to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen,” Dr. Calderu said, “you have a long, </span>
<em>
<span>long</span>
</em>
<span> life ahead of you. Don’t let this make you feel as though you can’t do anything and </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span> you set your mind to. It will all be okay.” She reached out, taking Agatha’s hand. Her grip was stronger than the younger woman had expected it to be. It was comforting. “Do you have any family?” the doctor asked. “A support system at home?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated at that. Her father had died when she was two. Her mother had never been kind to her even before that. Her father’s mother had done most of the child-rearing after his passing, teaching Agatha everything she needed to know. Agatha had even gone to live with her when she was seven, staying with her until her gran’s death when she was twenty-one, when Agatha was still in undergrad. She’d left Agatha with enough money in her will to go to grad school for Art History, leaving her house to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mother had attempted to take that house from her, but Agatha had fought back. Evanora Harkness had no claim to </span>
<em>
<span>any</span>
</em>
<span> of her mother-in-law’s assets, but that didn’t stop her from antagonizing Agatha until her own death when Agatha was twenty-seven. By that point, Agatha had earned her Master’s and opened an art gallery with an old classmate of hers, but she didn’t know if she’d count Jen Kale as family.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was the closest thing she had, though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Agatha shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu nodded and reached for one of the pamphlets from the counter, handing it to Agatha. “This is a support group,” she said, “for women with MS. They meet twice a week at the Westview Community Center. Please consider attending.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, taking the pamphlet, though she had no real intentions of going to a support group. She didn’t need anybody else. She had gotten through adult life thus far mostly on her own. She didn’t need anybody.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I don’t need anybody.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>That was the mantra in her head as she changed into her running shorts and hoodie, slipping easily from her Converse to the running shoes, and headed off on her second run that day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a nice day for October, the sun still shining through the gaps in the trees as leaves crunched underneath Agatha’s feet, which pounded the pavement of the sidewalks through Westview. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I don’t need anybody else. I’ll be fine. I am fine.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She passed the Westview Community Center without giving it a cursory glance, shaking her head slightly as she picked up her pace, checking for cars as she crossed the street, keeping her breathing even as she started running up an incline. She loved hills. They provided her with a challenge. They made her muscles work just a little bit harder, added a little bit of strain to her lungs and heart, more muscles that could be strengthened.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Will I still be able to do this in ten years? Twenty?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook away the thoughts, her long ponytail slightly slapping her in the side of the face as she continued to run, sweat beading on her temples, starting to make the front of her shirt damp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She ran past a park with a track that she ran on in the mornings, when it was mostly empty. Now, there were people milling about, families having picnics in the afternoon sun, smiling and laughing like there wasn’t a worry in the entire world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up her speed again, running straight past the park and taking a familiar turn at the corner. She knew this neighborhood – this whole town, really – like the back of her hand. She had moved to Westview, New Jersey, from Salem, Massachusetts, when she moved in with her gran, after her mother had signed away her rights, not giving a single shit about her only child. Agatha had been upset when Evanora told her to start packing her shit, that she was moving out. She had thought that Evanora was taking her away, moving her further from the grandmother that she didn’t get to see </span>
<em>
<span>nearly enough</span>
</em>
<span> because of her mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Gran had been in the kitchen when Agatha walked out with her suitcases, beaming down at her with her arms out. Agatha had run straight into them, pressing her face into her gran’s neck, feeling her kisses on her cheeks and temples.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go home,” she’d said, taking one of Agatha’s suitcases and guiding her out the door with a gentle hand on her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hadn’t even spared her mother a second glance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She never missed Evanora, not even for a second. And Evanora never called, anyway. She </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> show up at her grandmother’s funeral, but Agatha hadn’t even acknowledged her, ignoring whispers about her being ‘cold’ and ‘cruel’ to her own mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t give two fucks about Evanora Harkness. Agatha hadn’t even attended her funeral. When she’d been sent a small urn of her mother’s ashes by a distant family member, she’d poured them down the toilet because </span>
<em>
<span>fuck that bitch</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s calves were starting to burn with her effort. She had probably already run the entire length of Westview, which was confirmed when she saw the distant town sign in the distance. If she ran past it, it wouldn’t be too long before she reached Eastview.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t feel like going to Eastview today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made a wide U-turn, crossing the street to keep herself from stopping. She couldn’t stop. If she stopped running, everything, she knew, would fall apart. She couldn’t let everything fall apart. Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned another corner, making her way back in the direction of her house. Her legs were starting to get tired. Usually, she could run right through it, push herself just a tiny bit more, but she had already done that today. She was just tired now. She needed to rest. And she needed to be somewhere safe when she broke down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t run home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer Kale lived two blocks down from Agatha, in one of the fancier apartment buildings on a whole block of apartment buildings. Her doorman instantly recognized Agatha as she ran toward him, opening the door for her just in time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, George!” Agatha called over her shoulder as she jogged through the lobby, bypassing the elevators in favor of the stairs for the third floor apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen lived in Apartment 3B. Agatha rapped on the door, jogging in place as she waited for the door to open. Her heart was pounding in her throat now, her knees aching slightly, the muscles in her calves burning as she waited…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Jen asked, placing a hand on her hip. She was wearing a salmon-colored sweater and a matching beanie. Her pants were soft gray cotton and her feet were bare on the hardwood floor. “What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And, all at once, the dam burst. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tears flooded Agatha’s eyes the second she stopped jogging, her legs giving out beneath her as she crumpled to the ground, her body wracked with sobs. Jen’s eyes widened and she immediately got to the ground with her, her perfectly-manicured fingers reaching out to cup Agatha’s cheeks, which were drenched with her tears. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” she asked, panicked. “Agatha!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned forward, pressing her face to Jen’s shoulder, her tears soaking through the impossibly soft sweater. All Jen could do was wrap her arms around Agatha’s shoulders, her hands stroking up and down her back. She had never seen Agatha shed more than a few tears over a particularly moving art piece. To see her break down like this over…well, Jennifer didn’t even </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> what had happened. What </span>
<em>
<span>could </span>
</em>
<span>have happened to bring Agatha Harkness to tears like this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Jen said, tugging Agatha into the apartment and shutting the door. Agatha obviously wasn’t in her right mind because the Agatha that Jen knew – stone-cold, tough as nails, sharply charming, secretly soft and somewhat maternal – would </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> want a stranger to see her cry. The fact that she was here, sobbing in Jennifer’s arms right now, was…worrying. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen led Agatha to her couch, which was light pink and plush and had a fuzzy white throw blanket on the back of it. Jen sat down with Agatha still in her arms and tugged the blanket around her shoulders, separating only for long enough to wrap Agatha up before wrapping her arms around her again. Agatha wasted no time in pressing her wet face to Jen’s neck again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen just waited her out, rubbing Agatha’s shoulder and pressing her cheek to the top of her head. Agatha’s shoulders continued to shake for a few more minutes as she sobbed, but Jen could tell she was starting to wind down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When all she could hear were a few watery sniffles and the clearing of Agatha’s throat, she finally pulled away some to look down into Agatha’s eyes. Agatha avoided her gaze, her cheeks pink with embarrassment, the hair that had escaped from her ponytail sticking to her face. Jen pushed it away, softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha still didn’t look at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want some water?” Jen asked, trying to keep her voice even and casual. “You look like you just went for a run; you’re going to dehydrate yourself if you keep leaving the house without water, dumbass.” She shoved Agatha’s shoulder playfully when Agatha let out an amused snort, nodding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Jen said, standing up out of Agatha’s embrace. Agatha let her go easily, wrapping the blanket more firmly around herself as she sank into the couch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen spared her a concerned glance as she entered her kitchen area (thank </span>
<em>
<span>Goddess</span>
</em>
<span> for open floor plans) and grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge. She brought it back to Agatha, who was now staring blankly into outer space. Jen flopped down next to her, pressing the water into her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fist closed around the bottle and she looked down at it. Her brows furrowed and she let out a scoff. “</span>
<em>
<span>Voss</span>
</em>
<span>?” she said. “Really, Kale? How pretentious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And there she is,” Jen laughed. “Welcome back, Harkness.” She knocked against Agatha’s shoulder with her own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, taking a long sip of her water. Jen waited her out for a moment or two before speaking again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she said, “what happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>More tears appeared in Agatha’s eyes, but she stubbornly refused to let them fall. “I went to the doctor today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t told Jen that she was going to the doctor. She had only told Jen about her left side going a little fuzzy. She was still able to use it, but she was clumsier, and it limited her ability to paint, so she had mostly ignored it, blaming it on the stupid flu shot, until she had something more to worry about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen had forgotten about it, obviously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said. “Why? What’s going on? Is it about the headaches?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha had forgotten about the headaches. She should have told her doctor about them, too. It made sense that she’d have them, what with the lesions in her brain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d complained to Jen about them a few times, popping a few Advil every now and then to rid herself of them so that she could stand the bright lights in their gallery during shows. It usually helped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Usually.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sort of…” she said. “It’s connected, I think.” She shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay…do you have, like, a brain tumor?” Jen asked. “Is it brain tumor Agatha that’s a bitch? If they remove it, will you be all sunshine and rainbows?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Agatha huffed, but she couldn’t resist the upturn of her lips. “No,” she said. “I don’t have a brain tumor, Kale. Bitchy Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> real Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shame,” Jen tutted. Agatha shoved her so hard that she fell over, cackling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not my type,” Jen retorted, pushing herself back up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was in junior year,” Agatha snarked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And look how that turned out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“With a successful art gallery?” Agatha shrugged. “Could’ve gone worse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>After</span>
</em>
<span> you ghosted me for a full year until our graduation,” Jen pointed out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you said I wasn’t your type, Jenny,” Agatha purred, batting her eyelashes at the taller woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen huffed, shoving her. “Don’t call me Jenny. I left my favorite sweater in your dorm room, and it took </span>
<em>
<span>forever</span>
</em>
<span> to get it back because you kept dodging me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You got it back eventually, didn’t you?” Agatha huffed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” Jen said, rolling her eyes. Then she got serious. “So…what happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took another sip of water, steeling herself for what she was about to reveal. She swallowed past the lump in her throat and pressed her lips together before looking up at Jen, her oldest…friend? They were business partners, but she wouldn’t have considered Jen Kale her friend until right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Really, she was her </span>
<em>
<span>only</span>
</em>
<span> friend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha got along well with the artists whose work they showcased, but she didn’t go out for drinks with any of them. She didn’t veg out on their couches on off days, watching bad, usually straight, rom coms and drinking wine like she did with Jen. They barely ever hugged. Jen hadn’t really seen Agatha cry until now. Agatha had </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> seen Jennifer cry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But they </span>
<em>
<span>were</span>
</em>
<span> friends, Agatha realized. They were </span>
<em>
<span>best</span>
</em>
<span> friends, as odd as it felt to even think. As such, she decided that Jen deserved to know. After all, they also worked together. If something happened and Agatha couldn’t do that anymore, well Jen would be the one that deserved to know the most.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have MS,” Agatha blurted, the words sending a shockwave throughout her entire body. It was the first time she’d said those words aloud. It felt unreal, like they belonged to somebody else. They couldn’t </span>
<em>
<span>possibly</span>
</em>
<span> belong to Agatha, who ran miles every single morning before she even had her first cup of coffee. Agatha, who kept herself in shape and ate well enough and worked out whenever she had a spare hour to herself. Agatha, who worked hard to run a successful art gallery and sold her own paintings for more money than she would have ever thought possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How could </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha Harkness have such a devastating disease?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Jen said, her voice low and gentle. “That really sucks, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, tears falling down her cheeks again. She swiped them away furiously. “Yeah,” she said. “It really does.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt Jen’s fingers interlace with hers between their bodies. She felt Jen’s cheek rest on top of her head again, closed her eyes as Jen’s warmth enveloped hers again, comforting her. Agatha leaned back against her shoulder, taking a deep, shuddering breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you wanna talk about it?” Jen asked after a long moment of silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha sniffled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you wanna order takeout and get drunk?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, Jen Kale was </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> her best friend.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha said, nodding. “</span>
<em>
<span>Please</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Jen said. “I have a bottle of noir I’ve been meaning to crack open. Pizza, sushi, or thai?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t care,” Agatha sighed. “Whatever you feel like is fine. Can I take a shower? I feel smelly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> smelly,” Jen snorted, dodging Agatha’s kick as she ran away from the couch, chortling. “Girl, you just went for a run. You showed up </span>
<em>
<span>drenched </span>
</em>
<span>in sweat. Even </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> can admit that you </span>
<em>
<span>stank</span>
</em>
<span>.” She waved her hand in front of her face as she went for the takeout drawer next to her fridge, pulling out an array of menus and spreading them out on the counter. “There are fresh towels in the hall closet,” she called over her shoulder as she Eeny Meeny Miney Mo’ed their options. “I’ll put some clean clothes outside the bathroom if you don’t want to get back into those sweaty ones. You can wash them while we eat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds good,” Agatha said, groaning as she got to her feet. Her legs felt like jelly after that run. Good thing Jennifer Kale was a pretentious priss who not only bought overpriced bottles of water, but had also renovated her shower so that there was a bench for Agatha to sit on as the hot water ran over her sore muscles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat in the shower for far too long, allowing the water to rinse off the run and the rest of that day down the drain. She used Jennifer’s expensive, coconut-scented body wash and her pink sugar scrub on her legs, then wrapped herself in a hot pink towel, sighing in relief as she sat at the vanity in the oversized bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer Kale had grown up the only child of two ridiculously wealthy and incredibly affectionate suburbanites. Her mother, Naomi, showed up for all holidays, major or minor (think Arbor Day) to spend time with Jen and, by extension, Agatha. She oohed and aahed at their art installations, raining affection and praise on ‘her’ girls, and treated them to nice dinners on the town.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha actually </span>
<em>
<span>adored</span>
</em>
<span> Naomi Kale. She was everything that Agatha’s grandmother had been and everything Agatha wished that </span>
<em>
<span>her mother</span>
</em>
<span> would have been.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Being raised wealthy and well-loved, Jen was relatively well-rounded. She was the tiniest bit selfish (she didn’t share food and she was always her own priority), but she did have a generous spirit for the most part. She gave to charity and volunteered at some local events (which she insisted was just a way to get good press for the gallery) and, despite consistently teasing her, was always there for Agatha when she needed her most.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slipped into a t-shirt and a pair of Jen’s sweatpants, which she had to roll the waistband several times not to trip over herself, and padded barefoot into the kitchen, where Jen was already unpacking several containers of sushi and rice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course you went for the most expensive option,” Agatha huffed even as she reached for a container of rice. “How much do I owe you?” They always split their shared meals fifty-fifty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Jen said. “This one’s on me. I’m keeping most of the leftovers, anyway. You can have your California and salmon rolls.” She wrinkled her nose, pushing two containers toward Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t make that face,” Agatha huffed. “They’re </span>
<em>
<span>delicious</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re children’s sushi,” Jen said, pointing her chopsticks at Agatha. “You need to mature your palate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“With what?” Agatha snorted. “Spicy tuna rolls? </span>
<em>
<span>Very</span>
</em>
<span> mature.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Try some of my inari,” Jen said, holding up her container. “It’s </span>
<em>
<span>delicious</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wrinkled her nose, pulling away from the counter with her food and chopsticks. “No thanks,” she said. “I think I’ve been through enough today, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh,” Jen said. “Agatha Harkness has a new card to play.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yep!” Agatha said, sticking her nose up as she walked into the living room, placing her food onto the coffee table. “And I am going to use it </span>
<em>
<span>generously</span>
</em>
<span> for a while, so be warned.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Noted,” Jen snorted, balancing her chopsticks and sushi in one hand, two wine glasses in the other, and her bottle of pinot noir under her arm. She expertly placed everything on her side of the coffee table and reached for the remote. “So,” she said, “what are we watching?”</span>

<b>Chapter Two</b>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, Jen Kale’s bougie ass apartment also had a spare room with a queen-sized bed that was </span>
<em>
<span>just</span>
</em>
<span> as soft as one might expect. Agatha stretched across it, getting tangled up in the sheets, and was out like a light in minutes…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only to wake up at three in the morning with her heart pounding, her face covered in sweat like she had just run several miles </span>
<em>
<span>again</span>
</em>
<span>. She sat up, shoving the blankets off of herself and pressed her hand to her chest, fighting to breathe as though somebody were covering her mouth and nose with their full fucking hand. She furiously shoved back the strands of hair that were sticking to her face, irritating her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned forward, wrapping her arms around her knees, making herself as small as possible, tightening her entire body into a ball, trying to calm her racing heart and slow her breathing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally did, she felt her body relax slightly into the mattress and the pillows behind her, but she didn’t release herself from the ball. Instead, she fell sideways, still balled up, and shut her eyes tight, willing herself to go back to sleep even as tears started to squeeze out from beneath her tightly shut eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” she whispered, sniffling. “Please, please, please…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She willed herself to fall asleep or, maybe, to wake up. Surely, </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> was the bad dream. This nightmare where she was diagnosed with a debilitating disease that would slowly take her fine motor functions away, leaving her with that fuzzy feeling from the year prior, which had rendered her dominant hand almost entirely useless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed to wake up from this dream. Maybe she’d wake up in her own bed, two blocks away, to the blaring of her alarm that reminded her to go for her daily run. Maybe the lingering ache in her legs from her last run would diminish and she’d be able to get up and get ready for the next one. Maybe she’d attend the </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span> doctor’s visit and be told that it was all just a mistake: her MRI scans were clear and perfect and showed that Agatha was </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> the healthiest person they’d ever seen, mentally, physically, </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> emotionally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, even that last part was a stretch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had seen a therapist in her late teens, at her gran’s insistence. Dr. Hart had attributed everything to childhood trauma, more or less. The nightmares she’d been having about her mother showing up to take her away (impossible, as Gran had been her legal guardian for nearly a decade at that point) to her love of art and the emotions it invoked in Agatha which were otherwise hard for her to really show. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Art is the key to your heart,</span>
</em>
<span>” Dr. Hart had said. </span>
<em>
<span>“It unlocks something deep within you, something that you can’t quite unlock on your own.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was a quack, Agatha decided, and Agatha convinced Gran to let her stop going after three months, insisting that her nightmares were over (they were not, but Agatha was better at dealing with them at that point, no longer screaming when she awoke) and that the therapist was weird and </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> too perky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she didn’t like her nasally laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gran had relented, warning Agatha that if she woke her up with one more nightmare, she would be sent to a new therapist. Agatha had agreed to this, but she never screamed in her sleep again, able to keep herself quiet if she ever woke up crying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Also, Gran didn’t like to admit it, but she was in serious need of some hearing aids, so Agatha doubted she’d hear very much </span>
<em>
<span>anyway</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At some point, Agatha drifted back off to sleep. The next time she woke up, the sun was shining through the window above her bed and whatever Agatha had been dreaming of – </span>
<em>
<span>if</span>
</em>
<span> she’d even dreamt of anything – was already slipping away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha got dressed in Jen’s laundry room, slipping back into her clean workout clothes and tossing the clothes Jen had lent her into the washer with a few things from her hamper. She put in the detergent and fabric softener and started the load before padding back out into the kitchen, where Jen was enjoying a stupidly expensive cup of gourmet coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was another cup on the kitchen island with Agatha’s name on it, literally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was wondering where that went,” Agatha said, picking up the royal purple mug with her name scribbled on it in gold, swoopy lettering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You left it on your desk last week,” Jen said, “at the gallery. It looked like it had been there for, like, </span>
<em>
<span>weeks</span>
</em>
<span>. It still had coffee in it. I brought it home to wash it. Figured you’d come here at some point to find it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aww, Jenny,” Agatha cooed, pinching her cheek as she took a sip of the coffee. </span>
<em>
<span>Shit, that’s good</span>
</em>
<span>. Maybe expensive </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> better sometimes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen slapped her hand away. “Don’t call me Jenny,” she huffed. “I’m not four.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snickered as she drank her coffee. Jen had put oatmilk and sugar in it for her, knowing just how she liked her coffee. Agatha knew Jen’s Starbucks order, too, so it really wasn’t that deep, but it still softened Agatha a little bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d never been great at making friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she was little and still living with her mother, she had been the weird girl who wore clothes that didn’t quite fit her right because her mother had fished them out of their church’s lost in found bin in place of actually buying her new clothes. It wasn’t like they couldn’t have </span>
<em>
<span>afforded</span>
</em>
<span> new clothes. Evanora had a decent-paying job and was able to dress </span>
<em>
<span>herself</span>
</em>
<span> just fine. Agatha’s father had even left them with a decent chunk of money – which Agatha hadn’t seen even a penny of until her gran carried on a long legal battle for it – so it wasn’t like she couldn’t have brought her to one of the cheaper stores or even the </span>
<em>
<span>thrift store</span>
</em>
<span> for some decent clothes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, instead Agatha was dressed in mismatched patterns, ugly sweaters, and stained jeans that were all either too big or too small for her size.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gran had bought her clothes whenever she visited, threatening Evanora to not even </span>
<em>
<span>dare</span>
</em>
<span> selling them or throwing them out or she would call social services on her without blinking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kind of wished she’d done it, but Gran had said that doing so might have actually placed Agatha in foster care. She needed Evanora to actually willingly give up her rights to Agatha. Which she did. Eventually.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she moved to Westview to live with Gran, Agatha was the first new kid they’d had in over a decade. Most of the people in Westview were part of families that had lived there since the early twentieth century, if not earlier. Agatha’s father had grown up there, but Agatha had been given her mother’s last name (for reasons she couldn’t quite fathom since Evanora </span>
<em>
<span>obviously</span>
</em>
<span> hated her from birth) so nobody really knew her despite the fact that they were familiar with her grandmother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kids certainly didn’t know who she was on the first day of second grade, so they mostly kept their distance. Agatha was already used to this in Salem, so she didn’t even really care. She was friendly with a few classmates as she grew up, hanging out with the art kids in high school, eating lunch in the art room as they worked together on their individual projects. She’d won a few school-sponsored art shows, got her name in the local paper, received congratulations from her teachers and her gran’s friends, but she’d always been kind of a loner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was another reason why Gran had insisted on therapy. Agatha had made a little more of an effort to make friends (or at least better acquaintance) with some of the kids in her classes. She’d done a good enough job that she’d been asked to Senior Prom by one of the artsy boys who later came out as gay. Agatha was </span>
<em>
<span>openly</span>
</em>
<span> queer throughout all of high school, but she still said yes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They both wore suits to Prom, with matching purple pocket squares. They had fun, but Agatha never really spoke to him after graduation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In college, she was better at socializing. She was mostly around people with similar interests, taking art classes and hanging out with her professors the same as she’d done with her high school art teachers. She had showcases and attended assigned gallery shows with her classmates.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She even lost her virginity a month into her freshman year, after a showcase, to a girl from her color theory class. Agatha couldn’t remember her name, but she wore a lot of pastels and flowers in her hair. They screwed in the bathroom on the second floor of the art building with Agatha sitting on the sink while what’s-her-face dove between her legs with everything she had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha got a lot of action in college after that, but it never interrupted her studies, and it didn’t mean that she had much in the way of friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fact that Jen Kale was her friend now after an awkward one-night stand and a year of trying to get back her hoodie (which Agatha had shoved into her closet and promptly forgot about after their one night together) was a minor miracle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe not so minor to be honest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You coming to the show on Saturday night?” Jen asked, breaking Agatha from her thoughts. She hadn’t even realized that she’d spaced out, her coffee cup almost completely empty at that point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why wouldn’t I?” Agatha asked, furrowing her brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen shrugged. “I figured, with everything going on, you might want to sit this one out.” She shook her head. “I know, it’s stupid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not stupid,” Agatha sighed. “I probably </span>
<em>
<span>should</span>
</em>
<span> sit it out, but…I just need things to be normal right now, you know? I need normal routines. Maybe I can forget that I even have this fucking shit.” She drained the rest of the cup and placed it back on the kitchen island.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you get any kind of medication yet?” Jen asked. “I don’t even know what that would look like, but I’ve seen some commercials for stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My doctor wants to put me on something with some complicated name, I dunno,” Agatha said. “It’s an injectable. Three times a week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oof,” Jen huffed. “I hate needles.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too,” Agatha said, “but she said it’s thin and gets injected into the fat, so it shouldn’t be too bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Girl, </span>
<em>
<span>where</span>
</em>
<span> is there fat on your body?” Jen asked, motioning to Agatha, who was back to her tank top and running shorts. Her hoodie was sitting on a stool at the island, allowing her to show off her arms and legs, her entire athletic build.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “There’s enough,” she assured Jen, lifting up her shirt a bit to show off her hips. She grabbed some of her right hip to show Jen that there was enough fat there, at least, for an injection. “And my thighs and my arms. Maybe my ass, if I get desperate. I have some fat, Jen. More than you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t ever think that phrase would make me feel bad about myself,” Jen said, “but here we are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “Can you wash this again and bring it to the office? I need to go home, change, and maybe paint. My fingers feel all twitchy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen nodded. “Make sure you don’t forget it next time,” she said. “You’re not growing science experiments in the gallery. It’s gonna make it smell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Noted,” Agatha said, slipping her hoodie over her head and making sure she had her keys, phone, and wallet. “Later, priss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Later, bitch,” Jen retorted, affectionately, as she snatched their emptied mugs and brought them to the dishwasher.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Agatha returned to her own house, it was quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Obviously it was quiet. Agatha lived alone. The house had four bedrooms, but only one of them had been in use since her gran’s passing. The others were mainly guest rooms or her studio, which had also been the room that Gran spent her last year on Earth in. Agatha had taken over the master bedroom when Gran got sick, at her grandmother’s insistence.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Dear, I can’t climb those steps anymore; you might as well just take it. I’ll be okay in the downstairs bedroom.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had still spent most of her time on the first floor of the house, though, helping the nurses with her grandmother’s treatments and watching old </span>
<em>
<span>The Price is Right</span>
</em>
<span> and </span>
<em>
<span>Jeopardy </span>
</em>
<span>reruns as she told her gran about her studies. Gran had a couple of good days, but she’d never been able to climb those stairs again, instead using her energy to bake Agatha’s favorite cookies and make lunch and dinner every once in a while, which completely exasperated some of her nurses because Gran was infamous for forgetting to take things out of the oven in her last days. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She almost burned the house down on three separate occasions, but Agatha couldn’t exactly </span>
<em>
<span>ban</span>
</em>
<span> her from cooking. She just made her promise to only cook when Agatha or one of the nurses was in the kitchen with her – and to always set a timer so they knew when to take something out of the oven or off the stove.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembered to do that about half the time, but she never nearly burned the house down again, thankfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After her passing, Agatha turned that bedroom into her studio. She still felt the presence of her grandmother whenever she entered it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it had the best light exposure with floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out into the backyard where Agatha used to play on the swing set that still sat there, a little bit old and rusted, but still usable when Agatha was feeling up to it. Before it was Gran’s bedroom, it was her sunroom, from which she would watch Agatha play on sunny afternoons in the summer or after school.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha still had the loveseat that Gran had loved sitting there, facing the windows, and the little end table she’d place her cup of tea on as she read and watched Agatha over the top edge of her book. Agatha would wave to her as she swung back and forth, going higher and higher, enjoying the way the wind swept through her hair. Gran always waved back with a bright smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gran had painted the room lavender well before Agatha had been born, and she’d kept it that way, painting it herself every couple of years, until she couldn’t lift a brush. Then Agatha had repainted it with a fresh coat before she made the move, adding some floral details that she knew her grandmother would love. She’d always been really big on florals.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha refused to paint over them when it came time to empty the room of her grandmother’s bed and clothes and do yet another repainting a couple years later. Instead, she painted even more flowers, looking up new ones to paint whenever she got the chance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Some of Agatha’s art now hung on the walls, both things she’d painted and pieces she’d bought from the artists that held showcases at her gallery. She only bought the ones that spoke to her, the ones that made her warm from the inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a painting, for example, of an old woman playing dress-up with a toddler, the two of them wearing feather boas, sun hats, and high heels. Their mouths are open in laughter as they each strike a pose, the corners of their eyes crinkled in their mirth. The little girl has blonde hair and green eyes, unlike Agatha, and the old lady looks </span>
<em>
<span>nothing</span>
</em>
<span> like her gran, but Agatha could still see herself and her gran in the painting, could hear her grandmother’s cackling laughter as they danced around a room together, just being silly like she’d never been allowed to be with her mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had put in a bid for the original painting almost as soon as she’d seen it. She paid probably a bit too much for it, but she wanted the real thing rather than just one of the prints they tended to sell in their gift shops after showcases.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she’d gotten it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of Agatha’s paintings hung on the wall adjacent to that painting. It was of Gran, sitting on her loveseat, reading a book with a cup of tea raised halfway to her lips. The vantage point was from outside one of the windows, where Agatha had taken a picture of Gran one day when she was a teenager. The top half of the window was propped open to see Gran more clearly, but also to let in fresh air on a warm spring day. She was gazing at Agatha over the edge of that book with the red cover, one yellowed page blowing in the wind. Gran’s bright blue eyes – eyes Agatha had certainly inherited from her and Agatha’s father – twinkled at her, her eyes crinkling with a bright smile hidden by the book. Her dark hair still had some of its brown around the edges.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was how Agatha preferred to remember her gran.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other pieces were a mix of paintings and photographs that Agatha had collected over the years, and not all of them were from her own gallery. While Jennifer splurged on luxury versions of most everyday items, Agatha used her wealth to buy and showcase art around her house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only the best pieces ended up in her studio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the closet in the studio sat her art supplies. When Agatha walked in that day, she made a beeline for that closet, selecting a 16x20 inch canvas and setting it up on the easel she left sitting at an angle by the windows so that it could catch the most sunlight. She settled on her stool with some gesso and a flat brush and began the task of layering it on. It was tedious, but Agatha was able to get into a rhythm pretty quickly, making sure to spread it evenly before waiting for it to dry. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she just had to wait. It took an annoyingly long time most days, but Agatha wasn’t honestly that concerned today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Today, she curled up on her gran’s old loveseat, reaching for her sketchbook and pencils that sat on the end table, turned to a new page, and began to sketch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d had an idea bouncing around in her brain for weeks now, her fingers itching to put it down on paper. But she’d had a lot to do with getting their next showcase set up, signing papers and negotiating with caterers and getting prints made up for the gift shop and…it was really so much to do. Agatha wished she’d known how much owning a gallery was more about making money than just appreciating good art.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They had showcases twice a month which lasted a couple of hours at a time, but Agatha felt as though they spent so much time just setting up for them that she was almost too exhausted to stop and appreciate what the local artists made. She hadn’t really connected with a piece in a long time, which frustrated her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It made it feel as though none of what she did was even worth it anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha channeled every bit of her frustration into her sketch, the figure of a woman standing ankle deep in a tide starting to emerge. Agatha probably spent too much time on the detail of the ripples around the woman’s pant legs, making it clear with her black pencils that the water was soaking into the material, before she moved on to what was beyond the woman: a sunset.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or a sunrise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t decide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the idea first popped into her head, it had been a sunrise. And the woman wasn’t wearing a suit like she was now. She was wearing a flowing skirt that danced around her ankles. And the tide wasn’t wrapping around those ankles; it was lapping at her toes, just barely kissing her feet. And the woman’s arms were raised as if she were embracing the warmth of the sun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In Agatha’s sketch, the woman’s arms weren’t visible, but it was suggested that they were crossed in front of her chest. Her hair fell loose and wild and a little tangled around her shoulders, reading to the woman’s ass, the ends broken and split and messy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sun was off-center to the left of the woman’s head, small and round and ringed by thick, dark lines to make it appear brighter to the observer. Agatha considered drawing clouds in the sky, but she decided against it. She liked the cloudless look of the sketch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she focused a little more on the shoreline. It was straight and went right through the woman’s neck in the background. Agatha drew lines for waves, making them a little wavy and adding some shape for the seafoam until she was satisfied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she pulled the sketch away from her to get a look at the whole thing, she couldn’t help but think about what might have been missing. She noticed that her hand had smudged some of the pencil around the edges and she made to erase it, but then she thought better of it. Instead, she used the side of her hand to smudge more around the edges of the sketch, adding a little more pencil to the drawing for more darkness, going and going and going until there was a fuzzy round border around the entirety of the sketch, black and messy and a little foreboding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she liked it. It fit, somehow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath as she placed the sketchbook back on the end table and stood, casting another glance at her unused canvas (it would take a long while to be ready for her oils) and padding out of the room to wash her hands and change. She still had a lot to do, and Saturday was only two days away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> not trying to avoid thinking about anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her doctor prescribed </span>
<em>
<span>Glatiramer Acetate</span>
</em>
<span> and Agatha had to drop by the special pharmacy in Eastview on the day of the showcase to pick it up.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Don’t take two doses within forty-eight hours of each other,”</span>
</em>
<span> Doctor Calderu had said. </span>
<em>
<span>“But make sure you don’t skip a dose. Set reminders for yourself. It’s better if you take them in the morning.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“What are the side effects?” Agatha asked, looking at the prescription on her phone. “Will it mess me up for the day?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“It shouldn’t,”</span>
</em>
<span> Dr. Calderu said. </span>
<em>
<span>“But it’s possible that you’ll feel a little tightness in your chest and pain at the injection site. I suggest you use an ice pack immediately after injection.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Noted,” Agatha had huffed, rolling her eyes. Why did the side effects of medications always sound worse than the disease itself? </span>
<em>
<span>Chest pain?</span>
</em>
<span> Jesus.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“We’ll check in with you in a few weeks,”</span>
</em>
<span> Dr. Calderu said. </span>
<em>
<span>“Blood test in about four weeks, okay?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Agatha replied. </span>
<em>
<span>As if I really have a choice</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, she </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> have a choice. Dr. Calderu said that she always had the option to refuse treatment and take her chances. MS was an unpredictable disease. It could move incredibly slowly through somebody’s body, and she’d known some of her patients to put off treatment for a few years and still be perfectly fine and mobile.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>At first</span>
</em>
<span>, she had stressed. But MS always caught up to them after a while without treatment. She </span>
<em>
<span>heavily</span>
</em>
<span> encouraged treatment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Agatha had chosen the treatment, deciding that it was better to be safe than sorry. She didn’t want to risk furthering the disease on the chance that it may be one of the more quickly moving cases of MS. She’d rather not find out in a year that she could no longer go on her runs because she’d foolishly decided to take a gamble on her health.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, as she looked at the injector in her hand, she was seriously doubting if being unable to use her legs was </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> that bad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> needles. It was the reason that she didn’t have any tattoos despite having a deep love and appreciation for them. Even getting her blood drawn (which she’d now have to do a whole lot more often to check her white blood cell count) made her squirm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she sucked it up as she loaded the injector and pinched the fat on her belly, closing her eyes as she followed the instructions and pressed it firmly against her skin, then pressed the button and…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing. She felt nothing. Agatha glanced down at the little window and watched as the injector pressed down on it for a full ten seconds before stopping, as the instructions had said it would, before she removed it from against her skin. A drop of fluid fell from the end of the needle and there was a tiny speck of blood at the injection site, but she felt zero pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A little itchiness, though. Agatha placed the injector on the counter and reached for the ice pack she’d set down to soothe the pain she had been anticipating. She placed it over the injection site and sighed in relief. The itchiness immediately went away, but Agatha pressed the ice pack to her belly for a bit longer before she set about disposing of the needle and cleaning the injector. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That wasn’t so bad</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha thought to herself as she placed the injector back into the carrying case she’d been sent with it. </span>
<em>
<span>I could definitely do that again. Easy peasy.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Three hours later, she was scratching at the injection site under the waistband of her pants, cursing the thick material for not allowing her to get good access to it. And it also now felt like there was some kind of ball beneath the layer of skin. It was firm, like a tumor.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha thought. </span>
<em>
<span>Is that another side effect of this medication? Spontaneous, quick-growing tumors?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She’d have to remember to ask Dr. Calderu next time they spoke. Or she could Google it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu did </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> support the “Google It” method of learning about MS though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nonetheless, Agatha found herself reaching for her phone as she walked around the gallery, glancing around at the photographs on the walls. They were from some Advanced Photography class offered by the Westview Community Center. The instructor had a good relationship with Jen Kale and had her own photographs featured in a decent number of their previous showcases, so when she requested that her </span>
<em>
<span>students</span>
</em>
<span> be given the same opportunity – on her dime, of course – Jen had jumped at the chance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sharon’s art has always been </span>
<em>
<span>amazing</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen had said, as if trying to convince Agatha, who was already on board. “It stands to reason that her </span>
<em>
<span>protegés</span>
</em>
<span> would be just as good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As long as she pays for everything,” Agatha said, “I’m cool with it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sharon Hart </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> paid for everything, from the catering to the prints that would be sold in the gift shops. Agatha just had to order and organize everything, but the photographer had basically given her a blank check. </span>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span> is how much she believed in her students’ work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was admirable, Agatha thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she wasn’t wrong, actually. Her students’ photographs were actually </span>
<em>
<span>incredible</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha forgot what she was googling the second she glanced up at a photograph of a shadowy figure with a cane standing on a stage. There was a spotlight behind the figure, the flare of light casting their shape in a glow, but their hair was wispy and the shape and tilt of their head suggested a smile as they cocked their hip, one leg crossed over the other. Agatha couldn’t see a single feature of that face, but they were breathtaking, nonetheless, </span>
<em>
<span>oozing</span>
</em>
<span> confidence in their stance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The name on the label next to the photograph said </span>
<em>
<span>Dulce</span>
</em>
<span>. No last name. Just Dulce.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Sweet</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha’s brain translated for her. Sweet photography. She didn’t actually know if that was the name of the photo or the name of the artist. Either way, it kinda fit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you like it?” a shy voice said behind her. Agatha turned around to see a young woman standing there in a black dress and a gray sweater, a cropped haircut that came to just below her ears with a blue streak on the fringe over her left eye, and a stud in her button nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offered her a gentle smile. “I love it,” she said. “It’s clear, has good exposure, and the subject is interesting. Well done.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” the young woman said. She had to be a teenager, Agatha thought. A college student at the oldest. “I’m Dulce.” The girl held out her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dulce,” Agatha echoed. “Nice to meet you. Agatha Harkness. I’m one of the owners of the gallery.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Dulce said, immediately flushing at Agatha’s raised brows. She shrugged. “My sister and I have been here before for other showcases. Usually photography, but we’ve also seen some of your art. And your partner’s. You’re a really talented painter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And</span>
<em>
<span> you </span>
</em>
<span>are a really talented photographer,” Agatha said, motioning to the photo. “Keep up the good work and you’ll go far. Maybe you’ll even end up with your work on exhibition at MoMA.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce’s eyes widened at that. She had big, expressive eyes. She was so young.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really think so?” she asked, glancing back at her photograph. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, also looking at the photo. “Your use of the light and dark is impressive,” she said. “At first glance, it looks like a black and white photo, but there are slight traces of color there, like the brown of the stage and the yellow of the spotlight behind your subject. Who is that, by the way?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My sister,” Dulce said, smiling affectionately. “She’s almost always the subject of my photos. She says it’s annoying, but I know she secretly loves it.” She laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And where is she tonight?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s busy on Saturdays,” Dulce informed her, “but that’s fine. She has her own art to focus on, and she said that she’ll be here in spirit, anyway.” She rolled her eyes and motioned to the photo of her sister’s figure.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Cheesy</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha thought in amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, she looks great,” Agatha said, “even if I can’t really see her face. I hope she’ll be your subject for many more years to come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too,” Dulce said. “Thanks for your kind words, Miss Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she corrected. “Please. It was nice meeting you, Dulce.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You too,” Dulce said, beaming up at her. She was so small, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembered being that small, but never that hopeful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brushed a hand over Dulce’s shoulder as she made her way to the next piece. The photographs were all really good, but none of them invoked the same awe in Agatha as Dulce’s. Maybe it was the fact that the figure had a cane and it was affecting Agatha because of her very recent diagnosis. Who knew?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha placed a bid on the original, making it big enough that nobody would likely challenge her on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you finally found a </span>
<em>
<span>photograph</span>
</em>
<span> that moves you, Agatha Harkness?” Jen teased as Agatha finished writing down her bid for Dulce’s </span>
<em>
<span>Untitled</span>
</em>
<span>. “I </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> thought I’d see the day.” She handed Agatha a champagne flute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have photographs in my house,” Agatha huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Prints</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen reminded her. “Never the original. Originals are the real deal. That must have made quite the impression. Which one is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll find out,” Agatha said, sipping on the bubbly champagne, “if I win the bid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will,” Jen huffed. “You always win the bids because you always bid way more money than these pieces are worth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gotta support your local artists,” Agatha shot back. “Especially ones that need help paying for college.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“College?” Jen asked, wrinkling her nose. “Sharon’s students all have masters’ degrees.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha gasped, her eyes widening. “You’re kidding. Even </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> one?” She motioned to where Dulce was speaking with another patron, a bright smile on her lips as she bounced on the balls of her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>Dulce</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen snorted. “Yeah, that one’s a prodigy, actually. At least according to Sharon. She graduated early from high school, undergrad, </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> grad. She’s twenty-three.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s impossible,” Agatha huffed. “Look at her. That’s a full infant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen shrugged. “Kids these days are getting younger and younger…I blame the skincare industry.” Agatha snorted, taking another sip of her drink. “How are you holding up?” Jen asked. “Do you need a rest?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m </span>
<em>
<span>fine</span>
</em>
<span>, Jen,” Agatha huffed. “My spine is still fully intact. I ran five miles this morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re good to come out for drinks after the showcase?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, you’re such a grandma,” Jen grumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Considering my grandma was cool as fuck,” Agatha retorted, “I’ll take that as a compliment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes. “Whatever,” she said. “Old lady. Thinking twenty-three year olds are babies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, that </span>
<em>
<span>child</span>
</em>
<span> definitely has Benjamin Button disease, okay? Or she’s lying about who she is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen said, “are supporting her.” Agatha’s eyes widened in surprise. “Please,” Jen snorted. “You wouldn’t be so invested in this girl’s age if you weren’t wowed by her artwork. You’re going all Mama Bear again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Again</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha gasped. “When was the first time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Billy Kaplan,” Jen said immediately. “The little twink from Eastview who worships the ground you walk on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t call him a twink,” Agatha said, her voice taking on a warning tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exhibit A,” Jen said, motioning to Agatha, who just rolled her eyes in response and took another sip of her champagne. “It’s cool to be a good mentor to these kids. Goddess knows </span>
<em>
<span>we</span>
</em>
<span> could have used that when we were just starting out. It’s nice that you get invested with the younger artists. You should really think about having kids, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m twenty-nine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And? My mom was twenty-six when she had me,” Jen pointed out, “and that was </span>
<em>
<span>after</span>
</em>
<span> waiting to establish herself in her career before she even started trying. You are established. You have the money. Have the child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t pressure me,” Agatha huffed. “Why don’t </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> have a child?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bitch, I might,” Jen said. “Eventually. I’m only twenty-nine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am going to hit you,” Agatha said, frowning at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you won’t,” Jen said, booping her nose. She practically sprinted away when Agatha made an honest-to-God swing at her, cackling and blowing a kiss over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t suppress her grin as she watched her go.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she got home later that night, she had her new art piece under her arm. Agatha made her way straight to the studio, flipping on the lights and placing it up against the wall, trying to decide where to put it. She didn’t have the energy to find another command hook just yet, but she did pick a spot next to her own painting for it, right in the corner of the room. It would look good there, she decided. She made a plan to hang it up the next day, after her run.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she shut off the lights, Agatha took another good look at the figure in the photograph: Dulce’s sister. She wondered if she looked like Dulce, if she were younger or older, and how she might react – how they might </span>
<em>
<span>both</span>
</em>
<span> react – to know that this photograph was hanging in Agatha’s personal studio, where only her favorite art pieces went.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I think they’d be ecstatic, peanut,” </span>
</em>
<span>she could imagine her gran saying. </span>
<em>
<span>“You are exceptional, after all. Anybody would be lucky to have their art piece hanging up in here.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Exceptional</span>
</em>
<span>. That’s what Gran had always told her. She’d repeated it again and again until Agatha somewhat believed it. And then more and more until Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> believed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was exceptional, as were all the other artists whose work hung on these walls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled to herself as she finally shut off the light and closed her studio door, making her way upstairs to her bedroom. She changed out of the suit she’d worn for the showcase and donned an old shirt with her college’s name on it, frowning as her knuckles brushed the hard lump beneath her skin. It was a little sensitive, but it didn’t irk her as much as it had earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just hoped it wasn’t anything serious.</span>

<b>Chapter Three</b>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s normal,” Dr. Calderu assured her that Monday when Agatha called. “Sometimes it just happens. Putting something warm over the injection site immediately after the injection should help, as should massaging the spot a little bit. I can’t guarantee that it will always work, but roughly four times out of five, it does.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And there’s no other medication I can possibly take that doesn’t involve sticking a needle into my body three times a week?” Agatha asked, trying not to sound like she was whining. She’d just done her second injection and it still didn’t hurt when she stuck the needle in, but there was another bump under her skin that was </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> sensitive to touch, right at the waistband of her running shorts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily, she’d already gone for her run that morning, but she didn’t want to deal with it chafing over the next few days because </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> would get real old real fast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are,” Lilia said, “but I don’t suggest them. They wreak havoc on your digestive system and cause your hair to thin.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked in the mirror at her bushy dark brown hair. She had just taken it out of the braid she’d put it in for her run. When she was a little girl, her mother had complained </span>
<em>
<span>endlessly</span>
</em>
<span> about that hair. She’d run brushes through it roughly, never bothering to make sure that she wasn’t hurting her daughter in the process ‘fixing’ her hair. Agatha had cried too many times because of Evanora’s roughness, had been slapped in the mouth for it, and had learned to hold her lips shut tightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once, when she was six, Evanora had brought her to the hair salon for a “trim” and had instructed the stylist to cut off over a foot of Agatha’s long, curly, </span>
<em>
<span>unruly</span>
</em>
<span> (according to Evanora) hair so that it fell to just below her ears. Agatha had sobbed uncontrollably and nearly got herself stabbed by the scissors several times in the process. The hairstylist had shed tears, apologizing profusely as she worked, rubbing Agatha’s back as she snipped off the hair. Evanora had wanted her to use buzzers, but she’d negotiated the bob, cleaning it up as much as she could to make it look as nice as possible. Agatha’s throat was raw as she was forced to thank the stylist, who just nodded tearfully in response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time her hair had grown back to its original glory, Gran had taken her in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ran her fingers through her hair now. As bushy as it could get, she took good care of it with countless products and regular trims to cut away the split ends. She had straightened it for a while in high school and college, but her sophomore year girlfriend had seen it drying naturally after a shower and had told Agatha that it looked </span>
<em>
<span>so good</span>
</em>
<span> curly and that she just needed to learn how to style it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Agatha did learn. She bought new products to put in it during and after showers, had learned how to brush it out while using a hairdryer, and had even learned how to brush it from the bottom to reduce pain from hitting knots. She thought about the little girl who had cried silent tears while getting her hair brushed, who had screamed while it had nearly all been chopped off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> her hair when she was little. It was another thing that other kids made fun of. But it had been </span>
<em>
<span>hers</span>
</em>
<span> and her mother had </span>
<em>
<span>forcibly cut it</span>
</em>
<span> and that was more upsetting than the fact that she’d had to have short hair for so many months afterward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clutched two big chunks of her hair and held them up above her head. It was thick as ever, sometimes poking up at odd places when she woke up from a particularly deep sleep. Jen had given her a bonnet to wear to bed, which Agatha used from time to time, but she often either tied it in braids or let it stay wild and free.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>loved</span>
</em>
<span> her hair now. If it ‘thinned’ she didn’t know what that would really mean for her. Would it lose its curl? It would definitely lose its volume. Would it fall flat? Would it feel like straw? Would it come out in clumps? Would she wake up surrounded by piles of her own dark hair, leaving her completely bald?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Dr. Calderu’s voice broke her from her thoughts and she turned toward the bathroom counter where she’d left her phone on speaker. “Did we get disconnected?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said, quickly. “Sorry. I just…I was thinking. Is there anything else that I could take that’s not three times a week?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are many treatment options,” Dr. Calderu confirmed, “but let’s stay on this course for now. Once we get to your three-month check in, we’ll see if it’s working. Have you had any other side effects? Chest pain?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha sighed, her shoulders slumping as she looked at herself in the mirror. “No chest pain. Just the annoying lumps.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hot compress,” Dr. Calderu reiterated. “It should really help. Otherwise, just let me know if there’s anything else of concern, like numbness in your extremities or dizziness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dizziness?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, it’s a neurological disease,” Dr. Calderu reminded her. “It’s not super common at your stage, but some patients have reported vertigo.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t get dizzy,” Agatha said. “I think I’m physically incapable, honestly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve never heard that before,” Dr. Calderu chuckled. “By the way, have you checked out the support group I told you about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um,” Agatha said, “not yet. I…haven’t really had the time.” She cleared her throat. “I had a showcase this weekend and we’re getting some new pieces of the gallery this week and I still have my own art to do…you know, I’m just busy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dear,” Dr. Calderu said, sounding </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> too much like Agatha’s gran, “you need a support system. You need people around you, especially at this time when everything is so fresh and new and scary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> scary,” Agatha huffed. It was a total lie. It was </span>
<em>
<span>terrifying</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Dr. Calderu didn’t need to know that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still,” Dr. Calderu said. “Just go once. I’ve been there before. Most of the ladies there are my patients and they are a </span>
<em>
<span>hoot</span>
</em>
<span>, I’ll tell you that!” She cackled. “Just one time and if you don’t like it, I’ll leave you alone, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, leaning over the sink, pressing her forehead to the cool metal of the faucet. “Fine,” she said. “One time. When does it meet again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mondays and Thursdays,” Dr. Calderu informed her. “Do you still have the pamphlet I gave you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha said, walking out of the bathroom. The pamphlet sat, untouched, on her dresser where she’d left it the day she ran all the way around Westview and collapsed, sobbing, into Jen Kale’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It has all the information you need. I believe they meet at six PM both nights. They really are amazing people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure,” Agatha said, padding over to the dresser to pluck the glossy paper between her fingers. “I just…I dunno. I feel a little weird about it, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Understandable,” Dr. Calderu said in a voice that was </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> too soft for Agatha to handle right now. “You wouldn’t be the first of my patients to feel this way, but the ones who had taken my advice and gone to the support group typically found that it helped, in some small way, to make them feel as though they weren’t so alone. Most of them don’t even attend every meeting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then what’s even the point?” Agatha huffed, dropping down onto her bed, looking up at her ceiling fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They go when they want to be around others who understand what they, themselves, are going through,” Dr. Calderu said gently. “Sometimes, it just takes one meeting to make you realize that you are not alone in this world, that there are others who share your very same burden.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Gandhi,” Agatha huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu snorted. “Please,” she said, “just attend one meeting. If you don’t like it, then I will stop bothering you about it and leave you to rot alone in your apartment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Promise?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Promise,” Dr. Calderu said. “Now, if you have no more questions, I have an appointment that I must prepare for. Do not hesitate to call me if there are any further issues with your treatment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha sighed. “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anytime.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The line went dead and Agatha sighed, rolling onto her side with her phone still in her hand. She glanced at the clock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was 12:37 PM on a Monday. There was a meeting in about five hours. Part of her wanted to skip it and just wait until Thursday. The other part of her was bored with nothing else to do today (they didn’t have a showcase for at least ten days and pretty much everything had been handled by the people who had booked the space so there wasn’t much for her and Jen to do, anyway) and just wanted to get this over with.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed a deep, dramatic sigh and dialed Jen’s number.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She answered on the third ring: “What’s up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing tonight?” Agatha asked, rolling back to look at the ceiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Smoking meth,” Jen retorted. “It’s Monday night, what do you </span>
<em>
<span>think</span>
</em>
<span> I’m doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you drive me somewhere?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Depends on where and when,” Jen hummed, “I’m not staying out all night with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All night?” Agatha scoffed. “It’s like you don’t even know me. No, don’t worry, you’ll be all tucked in between your absurdly expensive satin sheets before eight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Those sheets were worth every penny, I’ll have you know,” Jen retorted. “Anyway, where are we going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To the Westview Community Center.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eww,” Jen said, “why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong with it?” Agatha asked, furrowing her brow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It smells like feet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I signed up for a jewelry-making course there and promptly dropped out when I smelled the feet. It cost me fifty bucks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are weak,” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you the one that needs a ride?” Jen asked. “Are you sure you want to insult me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To be fair, I don’t need the ride because I can’t walk or drive myself; I need the ride for emotional support.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That only makes your insults worse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so very sorry, Jennifer Kale,” Agatha said, putting on a sickly-sweet tone. “Can you find it in your heart to forgive me and do me this favor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm…” Jen hummed, dragging it on for way too long. “Fine,” she said, at last. “But only because I have nothing better to do until </span>
<em>
<span>Real Housewives</span>
</em>
<span> is on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit back her comment about Jen still enjoying trashy reality TV. She </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> that would get her absolutely nowhere and might even cause Jen to dissolve their entire partnership. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nobody</span>
</em>
<span> messed with Jen’s </span>
<em>
<span>Real Housewives</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Jen,” Agatha said with a sigh. “I promise I won’t make you go in and smell feet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn right you won’t,” Jen huffed. “But, seriously, why the community center of all places?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um, I’ll explain later,” Agatha said, “on the way. I seriously need a shower right now.” She sniffed her armpit and recoiled. “Pick me up at a quarter to six.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup,” Jen said. “You’re buying me dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t know what one was expected to wear to an MS support group. She had half a mind to call Dr. Calderu and ask her, but that really wasn’t the woman’s job. She definitely had other more important things to do than give Agatha fashion advice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After her shower, Agatha still had at least three hours to get ready. She spent a good hour of that time playing with her hair in the mirror. She used a towel to pat it dry first, then reached for the blow dryer to style it into something a little more manageable than her wild curly look (but not by much) and stuck it into a bun while she tried to figure out how she was going to style it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had an endless amount of hair products (thanks in large part to Jen, who insisted that they were all necessary to take care of her “3b curly hair pattern” whatever that meant) but wasn’t even sure how to use the majority of them tonight. She knew that she didn’t want to keep her hair in its half-assed ponytail, if only because the elastic she’d used to put it up looked ready to snap at any second. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She made a note to get more scrunchies at the store (where the hell did they all go?) and tried to focus more on what she was going to wear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her closet was a mishmash of sweaters, slacks, mom jeans, skinny jeans, flowy blouses, t-shirts, tank tops, running shorts, sports bras, granny panties (they were more comfortable), nice lingerie (which was gathering dust, unfortunately), a few dresses (mainly for events) and a fitted suit or two (or five) that she’d splurged on for herself. There were also some pajamas and a couple of robes (one of which she was wearing because she didn’t like putting on clothes immediately after a shower, usually), but otherwise all that was left were her shoes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had nothing to wear though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, padding back to her bed and throwing herself down on it, quite dramatically. She reached for her phone and did a quick Google search.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Comfortable and casual attire is generally appropriate if no other dress code has been discussed prior to the meeting.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wondered what they considered ‘comfortable and casual’ attire. Her workout clothes were both comfortable </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> casual, but they didn’t feel appropriate to wear to a place where everybody would probably be sitting in a kumbaya circle and talking about their feelings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wrinkled her nose; she </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> talking about her feelings. It was the reason why she had quit therapy as a teen – then again as an adult after her gran died. She didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>need</span>
</em>
<span> to talk to anybody else about how she felt about how shitty her life had been and how shitty it was again now that she had this dumb diagnosis. And she </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> didn’t want to listen to others talk about how shitty </span>
<em>
<span>their</span>
</em>
<span> lives were living with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Dr. Calderu didn’t seem the type to let something like this go. She seemed like the kind of woman who might spend the next few months (years?) gently prodding at Agatha to attend a meeting until she finally acquiesced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned again and pushed herself up into a sitting position, glaring at her closet across the bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just one night. Just one outfit. She could do this. She could spend an hour listening to some women complain about their </span>
<em>
<span>stupid </span>
</em>
<span>autoimmune disease and how it affected their lives. She could force a smile and pretend that she’s listening even as she just thought about all the things she needed to do this week, like picking up her dry cleaning and going to the grocery store for more oatmilk and bread. If it got to be too much, she could text Jen to call her with an ‘emergency’ and leave early.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could do this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With renewed purpose, Agatha stood and made her way back to the closet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“An MS support group,” Jen echoed as she took off from the curb in front of Agatha’s house, “really?” Her brows reached what might have been her hairline if she’d had hair. “Wow, good for you, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck off,” Agatha huffed, crossing her arms over her chest. “My doctor is making me go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is the doctor in the car with us right now?” Jen snorted, glancing in the rearview mirrors. “Does she have a sniper trained on the car? I </span>
<em>
<span>just</span>
</em>
<span> got this thing detailed, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Oh, haha,” she said, “you’re a comedian. No, she just won’t stop bothering me until I try it out. She says that I need a ‘support system’ or whatever because my entire family is dead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean…” Jen said. “That wouldn’t be such a terrible idea.” Agatha shot her a look of betrayal. “Look, bitch,” Jen sighed. “I love you. You are somehow one of my dearest friends despite ghosting me in college–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How many times do I have to apologize for that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen went on as if Agatha hadn’t spoken: “And I’ll always be here to talk and watch shitty romcoms with you and support you through this whole shitty situation…but you </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> need a community. I’m just one singular person, and, as far as I know, I do not have any neurological autoimmune diseases, so I can’t really relate to the whole MS thing. But these women </span>
<em>
<span>can</span>
</em>
<span>, right? It’s, like, specifically women in this group?” She waited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha answered after a moment. “Women with MS, specifically.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay then,” Jen said with a decisive nod. “These are women who can relate with you, </span>
<em>
<span>to</span>
</em>
<span> you. And you can relate to them. It’s not going to hurt you to try a little bit. Hell, most support groups don’t even make you talk. You can just listen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know that?” Agatha asked, slumping a little more in her seat as she saw the community center coming up on the right. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got detention one too many times in middle school,” Jen admitted. “My parents were concerned that I was ‘going down a bad path’ so they decided to put me in a support group of similarly troubled youths.” She rolled her eyes. “None of us were really troubled; we just didn’t like some classes and we all had smart mouths. They took me out when I promised to do better at school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you?” Agatha asked, half-grinning even as they pulled into the community center parking lot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eh, I did alright,” Jen said, noncommittally. “But they never </span>
<em>
<span>made</span>
</em>
<span> me speak at group is the point. They tend to just wait you out, at least at that group.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I feel like my doctor has spies there, though,” Agatha said. “Like somebody is going to report to her whether or not I actually participated and then I’ll somehow be in trouble if I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Jen snorted. “Like you’re going to get a </span>
<em>
<span>bad grade</span>
</em>
<span> in group therapy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I dunno!” Agatha huffed, throwing her hands up in the air. “Maybe! If I don’t give it a real shot, she’ll just keep bugging me until I do, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then give it a real shot,” Jen suggested, parking the car right in view of the doors. “If anybody can understand what you’re going through, they can, right?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Aristotle,” Agatha huffed, undoing her seatbelt. “If I text you SOS, please call me and pretend there’s an emergency that needs my attention so I can leave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only if you text me after the thirty minute mark,” Jen said, reaching into the glove compartment for a book. “Until then, this is my ‘me time’.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Whatever,” she said, slipping out of the car. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen was already absorbed into whatever trashy romance novel she was reading.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t know exactly what feet smelled like, but this was probably close to whatever the scent was, she guessed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The main room of the community center was really just a basketball court with a stage on one end of the room. There were folded up bleachers on the left and right walls and a circle of about a dozen chairs right in the center of the court. Not far away from this circle of chairs was a table with different refreshments spread on them, including homemade cupcakes, Oreos, and a Box o’ Joe from Dunkin. Agatha grabbed a styrofoam cup and filled it with coffee, her eyes widening when she saw that one of the milk options they had out was oat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice,” she murmured, pouring some of the milk into her coffee and stirring it with a wooden stick. Then she grabbed a couple of Oreos and turned toward the circle of metal folding chairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There were a few people sitting down already, talking amongst themselves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman with hair that went from strawberry blonde to pale yellow at the roots sat with another woman whose hair was short, choppy, and almost platinum blonde. They were speaking animatedly in what Agatha assumed was Russian, though she had never actually studied the language.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another pair of women sat to Agatha’s right. They both had brown hair, but one was obviously older than the other. The younger of the two had her hair in a long ponytail and spoke animatedly with her hands. She had on a tight black sweater and dark ripped jeans. The older woman wore a red blouse and a navy blue skirt, her feet encased in black ballet flats. Her hair was pinned up on her head like she was a fifties centerfold. Her brown eyes had wrinkles at the corners when she laughed, which she seemed to do often.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Directly across from where Agatha decided to sit sat two more women, both around her age, by Agatha’s estimate. The shorter of the two had choppy black hair with orange-red highlights throughout. She wore a red leather jacket and tight black jeans. She had three piercings in each of her ears and one on her eyebrow. She looked oddly familiar…</span>
</p><p>
<span>The taller woman had black hair, as well, but there were no other colors dyed in, and most of it was hidden by a forest green beanie that slouched on her head. She </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> have piercings, however. There was a stud in her left nostril and several hoops lining the shells of her ears. When she smiled, Agatha could also see a tongue piercing that made something flutter low in her stomach. She wondered if she had any </span>
<em>
<span>other</span>
</em>
<span> piercings…</span>
</p><p>
<span>As if feeling Agatha’s gaze on her, the other woman glanced up and gave her a lopsided smirk, showing off a tiny gap between her two front teeth. She straightened up in her chair, the giant holes ripped into the knees of her jeans stretching a bit as more of her flesh poked through them. Her skin was olive-toned and smooth. Agatha felt the urge to reach out and touch it, to feel its softness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that would have been dumb, if not only because the woman was about six or seven feet away from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To distract herself from those thoughts (and those piercing gold-flecked brown eyes) Agatha shoved an Oreo into her mouth and chased it with a large gulp of her coffee, turning her gaze away to look down at her shoes. She’d chosen her Converse. The dark purple color matched the sweater she’d plucked out of her sweater, a white collared shirt beneath it. She also wore jeans, but hers were a lighter wash than the woman’s across from her and had zero tears in them. She looked like she was working in a library or something, but most of the women had on similar clothing – more or less.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman across from her wore a t-shirt with a picture of a suggestively-shaped cactus sticking out of a pot. Beneath it, in bold writing, were the words “Don’t be a Prick!” that Agatha couldn’t help but snort at. The second the sound left her, all eyes turned in her direction and she felt her face heat up as the hot woman’s (because there was no way to deny that she was hot) gaze met hers again, her head tilting a bit in curiosity. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shoved another Oreo into her mouth and gulped down some more coffee, only wincing slightly at the burn in her throat. She was going to feel that on her tongue for the next few days, she just knew it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She avoided the woman’s gaze by checking her nails, which hadn’t seen a salon in far too long. Maybe, she thought, she should make an appointment soon. She was due a little pampering. Jen would probably insist on coming, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good evening, ladies!” a voice said from the direction of the door. Agatha turned her head to see a woman with bright green eyes, fiery red hair, and a pair of crutches attached to her arms as she walked across the floor to a chair on Agatha’s right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite the crutches, the woman lowered herself quite gracefully down into the chair, like she was somehow lighter than air or something. Agatha was both impressed and jealous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She also wondered if that was how her future looked (the crutches, not the floating on air). </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’s everyone doing tonight?” the woman asked, smiling at the women sitting around the circle. “I see a lot of my usuals, but…” she stopped at Agatha, her smile widening, “also a newcomer! Welcome! So happy to have you here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave an awkward wave, but made no move to stand up. She shoved her last Oreo in her mouth and drained the last of her coffee instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, since we have a newcomer,” the woman said, chipperly, “it’s once again time to make introductions.” She cleared her throat and placed a hand on her chest. “My name is Wanda Maximoff. I am forty years old. I was diagnosed two years ago with Primary Progressive MS, but my doctors think that I’ve had it for at least a little while longer. I got these bad boys,” she patted the crutches, “about a year ago and I’ve been doing okay with them so far. My husband and my boys help a lot, too. My twins are twelve and a handful, but I love them. They come with me to meetings, sometimes, for support.” She shrugged. “What else…oh! I’m from Sokovia, originally, but I moved here when I was a kid, so my accent is all but gone. But it </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> comes out when I get excited about something, just so you know.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was looking specifically at Agatha as she said this. Agatha nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Wanda said, clapping her hands on her thighs. “Well, why don’t we quickly go around the circle for more introductions? Let’s start with Peggy here.” She turned to the older brunette woman who was sitting in the seat right next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy nodded, standing up with a soft grunt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello,” she said, with a posh British accent, “my name is Peggy Carter. I am fifty-two years old and I was in the British Airforce for well over a decade before retiring and settling down with my spouse. I was diagnosed with RRMS about five years ago, and it’s been a rather slow progression. I’m doing well, I think. I can walk almost as well as I used to, but sometimes I still find myself taking one of those scooters at the grocery store because I just can’t be arsed to walk around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Amen!” one of the blonde women said, eliciting laughter from around the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Peggy,” Wanda said. Peggy nodded and sat down, primly smoothing her skirt down beneath herself. “Maria?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second brunette stood a little bit unevenly, but she had a strong, athletic build. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, y’all,” she said. “You already know me. My name is Maria Hill. I am thirty-nine years old. I was </span>
<em>
<span>also</span>
</em>
<span> in the airforce, but I was stateside. Obviously, I am not British. I </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> born in Canada though, so that’s a fun fact about me, I guess. I’ve only had my diagnosis for a year, but I’ve doing fine. The injections </span>
<em>
<span>suck, </span>
</em>
<span>though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They really do,” the Asian woman sitting across from Agatha said, with more murmurs of agreement. Agatha just nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Wanda said with a laugh as Maria sat back down. “Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman that Agatha had been locking eyes with every so often nodded and stood, waying a little bit, though she tried to act casual about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said, addressing Agatha directly, “my name is Rio Vidal. I am thirty-five years old, practically the baby of this group, and I got diagnosed two years ago, after I took a bad fall on stage.” At Agatha’s raised eyebrows, Rio went on, shrugging one shoulder. “I’m a stand-up comedian,” she explained. “Or, well, actually a </span>
<em>
<span>sit-down</span>
</em>
<span> comedian, I guess.” She chuckled at her own joke, scratching the back of her neck. “I perform weekly at the </span>
<em>
<span>Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span> on Friday and Saturday nights.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The way she said it made it sound like an invitation. Agatha made a mental note to check it out. She’d heard of the bar. It was on the other side of Westview from where she lived, but she’d never gone there. Maybe Jen knew of it. Maybe Jen would want to go see a comedy show…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We all make a point to go at least once a month,” Wanda informed Agatha. “To support our funny girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flushed slightly and rolled her eyes, sitting back down. The woman next to her laughed and patted her shoulder. Rio shrugged her off, but she was grinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And still looking at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next woman stood without Wanda’s prompting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My name is Alice Wu-Gulliver,” she said. “I’m thirty-eight, and I was diagnosed four years ago with RRMS. I’ve been okay for the most part, except I have this tremor in my dominant hand.” She held up her right hand, which did tremor noticeably. “I know how to play pretty much all major instruments – piano, guitar, bass, violin, etc – but I really only play drums right now. I take medication for the tremors, but they’re too unpredictable to really play anything that needs finer motor skills. I do pretty well on my drum solos still.” She pulled a pair of drumsticks from her back pocket and air-drummed a solo in front of her. A few around the circle chuckled at that and Alice beamed before sitting down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Next was the woman with the choppy platinum hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello,” she said in a thick Russian accent, “my name is Yelena Belova and I do not have MS. I am purely my sister’s emotional support animal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop calling yourself an animal, freak,” the other woman said, her voice clear and very American. She tugged Yelena down and used her shoulder to shove herself to her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you would just </span>
<em>
<span>get me a dog</span>
</em>
<span>–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a grown woman,” the ginger-blonde woman said. “Get yourself a dog.” She offered Agatha an amused smirk. “My name is Natasha Romanoff,” she said. “I am forty-one. This is my dumb little sister, who is only here because the numbness in my right foot has left me unable to really drive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Also because I am very supportive,” Yelena pointed out. “And Natasha always buys me a milkshake afterward.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha rolled her eyes, smirking at Agatha. “I can practically hear you wondering why only one of us has an accent,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was, but she didn’t confirm nor deny it. She just stared. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> of us took speech therapy seriously as a child,” Natasha said. “We came here when I was thirteen and Yelena was seven. I immediately got into speech therapy and Yelena outright refused to even learn English for several </span>
<em>
<span>years</span>
</em>
<span>.” She kicked Yelena’s boot. “Stubborn ass,” she huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You see how she abuses me?” Yelena huffed, crossing her arms. “Rude.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha rolled her eyes. “Before I lost the use of my foot, I was a private eye,” she said. “Yelena worked with me and took over most of the footwork. I still do a lot of the behind-the-scenes stuff, but if you see me in public and I don’t immediately say hi to you? No, you didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded as others chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Nat,” Wanda said, warmly. Then she turned to Agatha, expectantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat and stood up, sticking her thumbs into the pockets of her jeans. “Hi,” she said, clearing her throat, “my name is Agatha Harkness. I was diagnosed a little less than a week ago.” She saw some sympathy and understanding flash across faces around the circle and she </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> it. “My doctor said that my diagnosis is pretty early, though. Like </span>
<em>
<span>unheard of </span>
</em>
<span>early. And it was because my stupid hand went fuzzy, like, a year ago.” She shook her head, flexing her left hand. “I never thought this would happen to me, honestly. I’m a runner, and I paint, and I take care of myself – for the most part. I mean, I just shoved three full Oreos into my mouth, which isn’t super uncommon for me, now that I think of it.” She laughed, nervously. Others laughed with her. Agatha cleared her throat. “I also own </span>
<em>
<span>The Craft</span>
</em>
<span> in Westview.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The art gallery?” Rio asked, her eyes sparking with recognition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her face warm up. “Yes,” she said. “My partner and I opened it right after grad school. Oh, I’m twenty-nine, by the way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A new baby!” Maria said, clapping her hands. “Rio isn’t the youngest anymore!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Happy day,” Rio deadpanned, rolling her eyes, but she grinned again, sticking her tongue into her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt butterflies in her stomach for some dumb reason. “Well, anyway,” Agatha said, looking down at her feet. “If you like art, we have showcases twice a month, and the gallery is open most days for casual perusal. We have a gift shop, too, where we sell the prints, so…come by if you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you there a lot?” Rio asked before Agatha could sit down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Most days,” she said, her heart pounding a bit at the way she had Rio’s undivided attention. “I usually get there around noon and leave at four or five. We’re closed on Sundays and Mondays, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why the hell was she giving this intense stranger her work schedule?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good to know,” Rio said, nodding. “Maybe I’ll come by.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha said, blushing. </span>
<em>
<span>Good? GOOD?!?!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She dropped heavily back into her seat and checked the time on her phone. She still had at least fifteen minutes before she was allowed to call Jen for a rescue.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Damn her and those stupid trashy novels.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha avoided Rio’s gaze, focusing instead on Wanda, who was still smiling way too brightly for her liking. “Welcome, Agatha!” she said. “It’s so nice to have you here with us. We hope you come back for more meetings.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” Agatha said, but she wasn’t planning on it. She was counting down the seconds until she could text her SOS to Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fourteen minutes left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Wanda said, clapping her hands, “does anybody have anything new to share about their lives? Any life updates or major events?” She looked around the circle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice raised her hand. “I’m going on tour with my mom for a few weeks,” she said. “So I probably won’t be around much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that’s exciting!” Wanda said. “Where are you going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just around New England,” Alice said. “Her drummer had some family emergency, so she was kind of in a bind. He should be back by the time they leave for the European leg of the tour.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still!” Wanda said. “You’re going to be touring with </span>
<em>
<span>The Coral Shore</span>
</em>
<span>, a major rock band!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Coral…is your mom </span>
<em>
<span>Lorna Wu</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha gasped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One and the same,” Alice confirmed, flushing slightly. “Yeah. I’ve been going on tours with her since I was a kid, but I was raised mostly by my dad. Most people barely know I exist. Mainly because my mom was totally insistent that I get a normal upbringing and not be thrust into a spotlight that was not of my own choosing.” She rolled her eyes, but affectionately. “She started letting me perform with her almost as soon as I was eighteen, so long as I kept my grades up at university and whatnot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Agatha said. “That’s…quite a life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is what it is,” Alice said, grinning shyly. “It’s nice to spend time together, if nothing else.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, as if understanding the desire to spend time with one’s mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, it’s very cool,” Wanda said, smiling. “I hope you have fun and take lots of pictures to show us when you return. When are you leaving?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In two weeks,” Alice said. “I know it’s a ways off, but I just wanted you all to be prepared so you don’t miss me too much. Especially </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> one.” She motioned to Rio, who rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure I’ll manage, Rockstar,” Rio said, nudging Alice’s shoulder with her own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever, Clown,” Alice retorted. “I know you’re going to miss me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes again, catching Agatha’s eyes. Agatha felt her cheeks go hot again when Rio smirked, once again pushing her tongue into her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure I’ll find something to occupy my time,” she said, her voice warm and eyes glittery. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice caught her gaze and smirked, nudging Rio’s arm as she shook her head in amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha completely forgot about Jen for the rest of the meeting.</span>

<b>Chapter Four</b>
</p><p>Rio Vidal couldn’t feel her left leg.</p><p>Well, that wasn’t entirely true. She could feel it, <em> somewhat </em>, but not enough to walk securely on it for more than a few steps without needing something to keep her upright. Which was why she used a cane that her sister had given her. It had a skull pattern lasered into the wood, along with flowers that she had hand-carved (not enough to disrupt the integrity of the cane, don’t worry) before she gave it to Rio for her thirty-fourth birthday. </p><p>Rio leaned on that cane now as she entered the Westview Community Center’s main room, inhaling the familiar sweaty scent of basketballs and peeling floor wax. She had played basketball here as a kid, the star of her community team, the Pistol Shrimps. She had led them to three straight championships before leaving for college on an athletic scholarship.</p><p>Those days were long-gone now.</p><p>Alice was already seated with a cup of coffee in her good hand and way too many Oreos in her not-so-good hand. Her hand was only trembling slightly today, though, which was good. Sometimes, Alice couldn’t use it at all. Most days, though, it was just fine. Today was an in-between day.</p><p>Rio grabbed a cup of hot water and stuck a green tea bag into the cup, inhaling the hot drink before taking a sip and hobbling to take the seat next to Alice’s. She stole one of her cookies.</p><p>“Hey!” Alice whined. “That’s mine!”</p><p>“You took way more than your fair share,” Rio retorted, shoving the entire Oreo into her mouth. “Theef arf fer effryfun, Alif,” she said through her mouthful. </p><p>Alice wrinkled her nose. “Don’t speak with your mouth full,” she huffed, holding the rest of her cookies away from Rio as she attempted to snatch another. </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and chased the cookie with a sip of her tea. “So,” she said, “how’s your mom’s tour going?”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Alice said, taking a bite of another cookie. “She wants me to take over for Ralph while he’s on paternity leave.”</p><p>“Ralph had a kid?” Rio scoffed. “Who would have a kid with Ralph?”</p><p>“His wife?” Alice snorted. </p><p>“Who the hell <em> married </em> that nutcase?!” Rio snorted. “Is she okay? Does she need help?”</p><p>“Well, she’s about two minutes from popping out his spawn, so…probably, yeah,” Alice laughed. “I dunno. She seems pretty crazy about him, and he’s been a wreck for the last week, checking his phone constantly. Mom promised to give him four weeks off the tour if he would just get through the next few rehearsals and bring me up to speed on the songs they’re performing. His wife isn’t even due for another month, but apparently Braxton-Hicks are a bitch that have been playing on their last nerves.”</p><p>Alice goes on about how much Ralph, her mother’s most recent drummer for her decades-old rock band, has been irritating everybody else with his wife’s pregnancy, not only in the last couple of weeks, but honestly since the pregnancy had been announced.</p><p>“This,” Alice said, “is why my mom <em> hates </em> hiring men for the band.”</p><p>“Why doesn’t she just bring you on permanently, then?” Rio asked.</p><p>Alice held up her trembling hand. “You <em> know </em> why,” she said.</p><p>Rio snatched two more cookies and shoved them into her mouth before Alice could even blink, grinning at her, impishly.</p><p>“You bitch,” Alice said, part disbelieving and part impressed. Rio waggled her head in victory and teasing as she chewed and swallowed the Oreos down with another gulp of tea.</p><p>They continued to chat idly about other stuff as others filed in. There were many familiar faces, of course. They didn’t get many newcomers to the Women’s MS Support Group – it was kind of niche. Some women only came sporadically, whenever they could take the time off caring for their families or when they had the energy, which could be hard to come by with a reasonably progressed disease. But they usually had at least half a dozen familiar faces.</p><p>Tonight, including Alice and Rio, they had seven.</p><p>Oh. Eight.</p><p>Rio’s gaze zeroed in on the woman that walked in, her steps slow and cautious as if she were walking on landmines, her eyes flitting all around her as if something were about to pop out at her. She had on a deep purple sweater with a white collar sticking out of it from beneath. Her jeans, unlike Rio’s, were light and unripped. She had a couple of piercings in her ears, but nowhere near as many as Rio had. Still, they looked good on her. </p><p><em> Anything would look good on her </em> , Rio thought as she eyed the other woman. She had an athletic build, which was clear even beneath the sweater and jeans, which were both pretty form-fitting (well, at least Rio could clearly see the curve of the woman’s ass, which she was <em> not </em> ogling…it was just… <em> there </em>.) Her dark brown hair was curly and fell loosely around her shoulders, a little messy but it also seemed to be calling for Rio to run her fingers through it.</p><p>Her eyes, from what Rio saw when they briefly met hers as the woman glanced around the circle, were the clearest blue she’d ever seen. Rio wanted to drown in them.</p><p>“You’re drooling,” Alice whispered in her ear, nudging her and breaking Rio from her thoughts about the beautiful new stranger.</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio scoffed, elbowing her gently in the side. “No, I’m not.” She wiped her chin just to be sure.</p><p>“She’s pretty,” Alice said, eyeing the newcomer. “You think she’s here for the meeting?”</p><p>The woman was now standing at the refreshments table, pouring herself a coffee with oatmilk. She took three Oreos.</p><p>“If she’s not, then she’s stealing from us,” Rio joked, but she was unable to really keep her eyes off of the woman as she turned toward the circle and searched for a seat. She took one right across from Rio and Alice. Rio tried not to get caught staring.</p><p>The other woman didn’t look at all like she belonged there. Unlike most of the women in the group, she didn’t have any mobility aids or any visibly trembling limbs (like Alice’s hand) or difficulty walking, as far as Rio could see. But that didn’t really mean much. Peggy Carter still walked just fine and she’d gotten her diagnosis half a decade ago. It just depended on how far along the disease had progressed.</p><p>And how long one might have ignored the early symptoms.</p><p>Rio hadn’t really even noticed the symptoms until it was too late.</p><p>She’d noticed her foot falling asleep a lot more often, but she had chalked it up more to poor circulation from her always sitting cross-legged on the floor or bending her knee up against her chest rather than anything she should have been concerned about. She had to just stomp it a few times and ignore the pins and needles, staticky feeling she got that always made her giggle just the tiniest bit when she stood. It only took a few moments and then it was back to normal.</p><p>No big deal.</p><p>Not until she was pacing across the stage at <em> The Witches’ Road </em> during one of her sets and felt her left leg go numb mid-step. It had come down hard and Rio had stumbled, landing on the hard stage with a thud and a grunt. She could practically see the birds circling above her head as she lay there for a beat too long.</p><p>Thankfully, she’d always been quick on her feet (in a manner of speaking) and sat right back up, crossing her legs like she was a little kid in kindergarten. </p><p>“I totally meant to do that,” she said, to nervous laughter from the crowd. “I’m just gonna stay right here, if you all don’t mind. It feels safer.”</p><p>Her sister had been in the front row, her eyes going wide with panic when Rio fell. Rio had given her a thumbs up to let her know that she was fine, but she could still see that worry etched in her little sister’s brow for the rest of the show.</p><p>Afterward, when nearly all the audience members had left, she had helped Rio to her feet and let Rio lean on her as they made their way to the exit, Rio’s leg still tingling when she got situated in the car. </p><p>At the hospital, she had several scans and blood tests, certain that she just had a blood clot or something. At first, they’d thought she had had a stroke, but she didn’t feel numbness anywhere but in her leg, and only in her lower leg at that. </p><p>They found the lesions on the MRI not long after and referred Rio to a local neurologist, who then referred her to Dr. Lilia Calderu, a sweet old Italian lady with kind brown eyes and an infectious laugh. If Rio had to hear bad medical news, she’d want only Lilia to give it to her from now on. </p><p>Lilia was the one who suggested the MS support group, which was being hosted by a woman named Elektra Natchios at the time. Elektra had been in her sixties and was a wheelchair user. She had established the twice-weekly group five years after her diagnosis as a way to bring together people who were feeling rather isolated by the disease. They all had one thing – or rather, one <em> person </em> – in common though: Lilia Calderu was their doctor.</p><p>Lilia had helped Elektra book the community center for her MS group and encouraged other patients to attend Elektra’s group. One of the women who started coming to the group, Carol, even helped make the first brochures for the group to make it look more official. </p><p>Elektra apparently ran the group for the first ten years before she needed to move into a nursing home and leave it fully. By that time, Rio had joined them for about six months and had found a tiny community there. Her sister had come once or twice in the beginning, for support, but Rio had insisted that she didn’t <em> need </em> to be there, that she was fine with her newfound friends.</p><p>Alice, in particular, had become one of her fast friends in the group. They were both performers and both the youngest in the group (besides Yelena, who was only there as Natasha’s ride and annoying baby sister) and they had a lot in common as far as their taste in movies and music went. Alice would often attend Rio’s comedy shows on the weekend and give her (unsolicited) notes on which jokes worked best with which crowds. Rio did the same when Alice performed with a local band in Eastview.</p><p>They had a good, mutually annoying, partnership.</p><p>When Elektra stepped down as the host, they cycled through others (Peggy was the host for a while, then Nat, then Alice was host once) before Wanda officially took up the post. She was thirty-nine at the time and had just started using Lofstrand crutches, but she never complained or seemed to tire out at all. She was a housewife and a mother to twin boys who often showed up to help her set up the refreshments table. They were cute kids, a little rambunctious at times, and super helpful to their mom and the entire group.</p><p>Rio couldn’t for the life of her remember their names.</p><p>Wanda Maximoff was a ray of sunshine, regardless, and very upbeat and personable. She was the <em> perfect </em> person to lead a support group, in Rio’s opinion. She always kept the energy up throughout each meeting, and her mind was like a steel trap. She would bring up something that somebody had mentioned <em> weeks </em> ago when conversation started to slow down just so that they would never stop talking. </p><p>Rio wondered if she<em> ever </em> got tired.</p><p>The other women were great, as well. </p><p>Nat and Yelena were like Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, always bickering about something, either in English or Russian, but they were doing it in an affectionate way. Nat had a similar issue with her right foot as Rio had with her left leg. Rio had once joked that they could <em> kill </em> at a three legged race.</p><p>“Or die,” Yelena had interceded.</p><p>That had gotten plenty of laughs from the circle around them.</p><p>Peggy was their new elder. She was posh and proper and had no children, but she treated them all like they were her kids, even though the youngest among them until now (Rio) was already in her mid-thirties. She still held some kind of authority over the rest of them, even though she wasn’t the host. Even Wanda followed her lead sometimes.</p><p>Maria was the newest (again, until today) with a new diagnosis of about a year. She had come to them two months into having the official diagnosis, on recommendation of Peggy, whom she had met at a different group, one for veterans. She was pretty mobile, by her own admission, but she had spells of vertigo from time to time, and headaches that sometimes prevented her from attending the group therapy sessions. She and Peggy were close, since Peggy’s spouse was also a veteran.</p><p>In the two years since she started attending the group, Rio had gotten to know all the women there, both the regulars and those who only showed up once or twice a month. She loved making them all laugh during group therapy, and she loved even more making them laugh when they showed up at the club to watch her perform.</p><p>She no longer paced the stage during her performances, instead opting to sit on a stool, holding her cane as she made others laugh. And she made others laugh <em> plenty </em> . She <em> loved </em> making others laugh.</p><p>Humor was how she and her sister had gotten through their parents’ neglect as kids. It was the most important thing she had. Even losing most of the use of her left leg couldn’t deter her from using humor now.</p><p>She found herself even more eager to make this woman in front of her laugh. She looked like she had a great laugh, a great smile. She watched her lips turn up every so often as the others introduced themselves, but mostly she stayed quiet and nodded along to whatever they were saying. She looked like a really good listener, too. </p><p><em> Goddess </em> , Rio felt ridiculous. She didn’t even <em> know </em> this woman. She was beautiful, sure, and her eyes were the color of a bottomless lagoon, yeah, and her hair was wild and free and looked so soft to the touch and–</p><p>“Rio?” </p><p>Rio blinked over at Wanda, who was looking at her expectantly. It was her turn.</p><p>Rio nodded and stood, cursing her numb foot as she swayed a little bit. She felt Alice subtly touch her back to stabilize her before pulling away. She cleared her throat and looked directly at the beautiful brunette woman. After all, <em> she </em> was the one they were all introducing themselves to, wasn’t she?</p><p>“Hey,” she said, offering a lopsided grin, “my name is Rio Vidal.” She did what the others had done: she introduced herself, how long she’d had her diagnosis, her age, and enough information to hopefully garner the other woman’s interest. </p><p>The brunette <em> definitely </em> seemed interested, which gave Rio a bit of an ego boost. She talked about being a ‘sit-down’ comedian, which earned a small chuckle from the other woman. Rio had been right; she had a ridiculously beautiful laugh. </p><p>When she mentioned that she performed weekly at <em> The Witches’ Road </em>, Wanda added that they tried to go as a group at least once a month. She loved Wanda for that.</p><p>Then she called Rio ‘funny girl’ and lost several brownie points for it.</p><p>Rio <em> hated </em> to be called ‘funny girl’. It made her sound like a child begging for attention from a group of her parents’ friends and being placated by said friends. This wasn’t that.</p><p>She flushed and sat back down as Alice laughed next to her, patting her shoulder.</p><p>“Don’t fret,” Alice whispered in her ear. “You haven’t lost her yet.”</p><p>Rio shrugged off her hand, but she couldn’t repress her own grin as she glanced over at the brunette, who was still watching her, cheeks slightly pink as she attempted to hide her obvious interest.</p><p>Rio’s grin only widened as she stuck her tongue into her cheek, a habit she’d had since she was a little kid and told her first really funny joke that had sent an entire room of adults into hysterics. Her parents’ friends had complimented her on her sense of humor and it had just planted a seed then and there.</p><p>Alice introduced herself and talked a little bit about her musical talent (she knew how to play pretty much every instrument thanks to her mom) and mimed playing the drums with the sticks she carried in her back pocket at all times, which earned her a chuckle from the group. Alice also liked to make people laugh, and Rio had to admit that she was pretty funny herself.</p><p>Yelena and Nat go next. Yelena doesn’t say much (she never does), but Nat explains their history briefly. Rio had been surprised to learn that they were sisters, but she hadn’t really questioned it after watching them interact for longer than ten seconds. They certainly bickered like sisters. Rio could attest to that.</p><p>Then it was the new girl’s turn.</p><p>Her cheeks were pink as she stood up, standing straight and tall though she was obviously nervous as she stuck her thumbs into her pockets. She offered the group a half-hearted smile as she introduced herself and her name sparked something in Rio’s brain.</p><p>“My name is Agatha Harkness,” she said. “I was diagnosed a little less than a week ago.” </p><p>Rio’s heart clenched at that. She remembered how she felt just after her diagnosis. It was like her world was ending, especially with a leg that refused to work properly. She had only ever heard about MS from celebrities who were already struggling by the time they revealed their diagnoses. It made the disease all the more daunting. She couldn’t imagine how Agatha felt.</p><p>“I own <em> The Craft </em> in Westview.”</p><p>“The art gallery?” Rio asked, immediately recognizing the name.</p><p>It clicked then for Rio. She remembered where she had heard the name. She loved walking through the gallery on days where she just had to <em> think </em> . It wasn’t too large and there were benches in front of most of the bigger installations. She was certain she’d never seen Agatha there, though – <em> that </em>, she definitely would have recalled.</p><p>“My partner and I opened it right after grad school,” Agatha explained. Rio felt her heart drop at that.</p><p><em> Partner? </em> So she was taken.</p><p>“Oh, I’m twenty-nine, by the way,” Agatha added, flushing.</p><p>“A new baby!” Maria exclaimed, clapping her hands. “Rio isn’t the youngest anymore!”</p><p>“Happy day,” Rio said, dryly, but one look at Agatha’s face had her smiling again, sticking her tongue into her cheek. Taken or not, Agatha was…<em> something </em>. Rio wanted to know more about her, regardless.</p><p>Agatha gave them a little more info about her gallery and Rio found herself asking if she was there often, flirting almost shamelessly despite the fact that Agatha had <em> just </em> mentioned her partner. She really couldn’t help it. It wasn’t like anything would come of it, anyway. Rio was flirty, but she was no homewrecker.</p><p>Agatha flushed again, and Rio couldn’t decide if that was because she liked the attention or she was just plain embarrassed by how much Rio was flirting with her. She tried to tamp it down as she listened to Agatha’s response.</p><p>She was there during the week, Rio learned.</p><p>“Good to know,” she said, trying <em> not </em> to sound flirty. “Maybe I’ll come by.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha replied, then her face immediately went red as she plopped back down in her seat, pulling out her phone. </p><p>Rio just grinned, leaning back in her own seat. Alice nudged her, snorting. Rio nudged back, shaking her head.</p><p>Wanda then opened the floor for anything anybody else wanted to talk about. After a long moment of nobody saying anything, Alice mentioned going on tour with her mom’s band (which everybody there knew at this point) and Agatha started asking questions about it, tucking her phone back into her pocket as she leaned forward with interest.</p><p>Rio was a little bit jealous of the attention that Alice received at that moment, she couldn’t lie. Objectively, though, it <em> was </em> interesting to be in the same room (and niche support group) as a rock star’s daughter.</p><p>Still, Rio wanted those eyes back on <em> her. </em></p><p>She got her wish when Alice made a smart comment about Rio missing her when she was gone. She retorted with something equally smart and felt Agatha’s eyes land on her again. She relished the attention though she tried not to let it show as she and Alice continued to trade teasing quips throughout the rest of the meeting. </p><p>Nat shared about some of her clients (only on long-closed cases) and Peggy talked about the preparations for her upcoming anniversary with her spouse. Rio never could figure out if Peggy was married to a man or a woman. She had always used the term ‘spouse’ rather than husband and wife, and she’d never really used pronouns. She seemed to be very careful about it.</p><p>Most of the women in the group, Rio mused as she listened to Maria talk about how frustrating it was to deal with the VA hospital, were some flavor of queer, she realized. Natasha was openly dating women and Yelena had a long-term relationship with the daughter of some elite family that she’d met through work. Maria wore a bisexual pride pin on the lapel of her trench coat and talked about ex-girlfriends with the same casualty as ex-boyfriends. Alice was a textbook lesbian, as was Rio.</p><p>She wondered about Agatha. She hadn’t mentioned the gender of her ‘partner’ but she could see Agatha being a lady-lover. Or maybe that was just hopeful thinking. The way she blushed anytime she caught Rio looking at her may have been a good sign.</p><p>The meeting ended far too quickly for Rio’s liking, and she watched as Agatha immediately stood and turned toward the door, tossing her long-emptied cup into the trash. Before she could make a full escape, however, Wanda approached her with a wide smile, leaning heavily on her crutches. </p><p>Agatha looked nervous, smiling shyly back at Wanda who was chattering incessantly about <em> how nice </em> it was to see a new face and to let her know if Agatha needed <em> anything </em>. Agatha just nodded, but Rio saw her gaze flit to the exit one too many times. </p><p>“You’re staring again,” Alice whispered in her ear, nudging her in the ribs. “What <em> is </em> it about the new girl that has you acting like this?”</p><p>“Acting like what?” Rio huffed, trying to play it cool, but she couldn’t keep her eyes off of Agatha for longer than five seconds.</p><p>“Like she’s a cold glass of water,” Alice retorted, “and you’ve been trapped in the desert for years.”</p><p>“I would be dead if I was trapped in the desert for years with no water,” Rio retorted. “The human body can’t be without water for longer than three days without death by dehydration.”</p><p>“How are you a comedian?” Alice scoffed. “You take everything <em> so </em> literally.”</p><p>“Only to annoy you,” Rio retorted affectionately, booping Alice’s nose.</p><p>Alice swatted her hand away and Rio laughed, glancing back in Agatha’s direction, only to find Agatha practically speed-walking toward the exit again, Wanda having been distracted by a conversation with Nat and Yelena. </p><p>Rio quickly stood and grabbed her cane, hobbling after Agatha as fast as her three legs could carry her, but by the time she got outside, Agatha was slipping into a custom-pink (because there’s no way it was marketed that way) Subaru with a tall, bald black woman in the driver’s side. The other woman smiled at Agatha and said something, but Agatha just shrugged, looking out the window. She caught Rio’s eye just as the car took off from the sidewalk and exited the lot.</p><p>Rio fought the urge to wave goodbye.</p><p>“At least you know where she works,” Alice said, appearing from thin air practically. Rio jumped.</p><p>“Jesus Christ,” she huffed. “You need to start wearing a bell.” </p><p>Alice just laughed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was met at the door by two furry little freeloaders, meowing and rubbing themselves up against her legs. She chuckled, scratching her gangly black cat behind the ears, relishing in Reaper’s purrs and the way she stretched to meet Rio’s nails. </p><p>Swan was next, barrelling past her sister for love and pets that belied the permanently grumpy expression on her face. She was almost the polar-opposite of her sister: a fat calico with a permanent frown and a brown spot under her nose that looked like a handlebar mustache. But she was super affectionate, especially with Rio.</p><p>“Don’t feed them!” a voice rang out from the direction of the kitchen. Her sister appeared, sliding in on the hardwood floor in her socks. “They’ve gotten dinner and <em> three </em> treats already. <em> And </em> they didn’t even hold their end of the bargain by staying still when I was trying to take their photos.” Reaper attempted to atone, rubbing up against Dulce’s legs and purring like a little engine. “Don’t pull that shit with me, Reapy,” Dulce huffed even as she scratched the cat behind her ears. “You’ve been lying down all day to the point where I thought we lost you, but the <em> one time </em> I need you to be still, <em> suddenly </em> you have the zoomies. This will <em> not </em> stand without punishment, you hear me?”</p><p>“Mrow,” Reaper said, looking at her with those big green eyes and her own permanent smile. Despite being a mostly black cat, Reaper had white markings all over her little face that looked akin to a human skull. She was like a reverse Siamese.</p><p>Rio could see the exact <em> second </em> Dulce broke, her shoulders slumping as she padded back into the kitchen for the container of cat treats. The second she touched it, both cats rushed in after her while Rio laughed, shaking her head. </p><p>She made her way to the couch, kicking off her shoes on the way, and collapsed onto the cushions in the corner of her sectional. Dulce joined her a few moments later, sighing as she practically fell face-first into the cushions.</p><p>“Long day?” Rio asked, carding her hand through her little sister’s hair. She scratched her scalp like she’d done when Rio was a little girl and Dulce groaned.</p><p>“You have no idea,” she said. “Why are customers the absolute worst?”</p><p>“Because capitalism is the worst,” Rio answered. “Pretty soon you’ll be living off your art, though. How much did you get for that one piece you just sold again?”</p><p>“Five grand,” Dulce replied, her eyes twinkling as she turned over. “Granted, three of those g’s went to student loans, but that’s still <em> two thousand </em> in the bank. I could afford to take a week off if I wanted.”</p><p>“You’re not gonna do that though, are you?” Rio snorted.</p><p>Dulce let out a long-suffering sigh. “No,” she said. “We’re short-staffed and Tommy was practically on his knees begging me to stay. It’s not <em> that </em> bad, I guess. I can still misspell people’s names on their cups, and that gives me a tiny bit of joy.”</p><p>“Don’t you get proceeds from the prints at that art gallery?” Rio asked, looking down at her sister as Dulce placed her head in Rio’s lap. “Won’t that bring in a little income?”</p><p>“I get paid twice a month for that,” Dulce informed her, “and I’m making <em> peanuts </em>. Less than twenty percent from each print sold, and they’re not all selling for 5k no matter how much I wish they would. At least Agatha Harkness complimented me.” Her eyes sparkled at that.</p><p>Dulce had been going on and on about the owner of the art gallery complimenting her photo since she got home on Saturday night. Rio couldn’t believe she didn’t recognize the name at her meeting that night until Agatha actually mentioned owning <em> The Craft </em> during her introduction. She tended not to be great with names in passing, though now she was definitely going to remember that one.</p><p>She considered, briefly, informing Dulce about who had shown up at her support group meeting, but then she thought better of it. Agatha Harkness wasn’t exactly a <em> celebrity </em>, but she must have been a pretty well-known figure in the community. She owned the only art gallery in town and it was pretty successful, just based on how Dulce described it, at least. </p><p>Rio didn’t know if Agatha wanted the news of her recent diagnosis out there, even just for Rio’s star-struck baby sister.</p><p>So when Dulce asked Rio how her meeting went, Rio simply shrugged. “Same old, same old,” she said. “You know. All the usuals.”</p><p>“No cute new women for you to seduce with your quick wit?” Dulce teased, grinning up at her.</p><p>“If my wit was that quick,” Rio retorted, “I wouldn’t have to spend all week on new stand-up routines.”</p><p>“Eh, it’s quick enough,” she said. “I remember high school Rio getting <em> all </em> the chicks.”</p><p>“That’s only because I had a cute kid hanging off my leg, charming all the ladies with her dimples.” She poked one dimple now, making Dulce giggle. </p><p>Rio had been twelve years old when her parents gave birth to their second “oops” baby. They really hadn’t meant to have children at all, but Rio had been a prom night accident that they’d decided to half-heartedly raise until she was ‘self-sufficient’ at the ripe age of six, when she got get herself dressed for kindergarten, throw enough into her lunchbox to constitute a relatively-balanced meal, and walk down to wait for the school bus at the corner. They only showed up when they needed to at the school (parent-teacher conferences, school recitals, and moving up ceremonies), but otherwise Rio was raised mainly by babysitters while her parents worked late or enjoyed their twenties. </p><p>Her mother had just turned thirty when the second line appeared on the pregnancy test. They were a little more excited this time around, older and somewhat more mature, <em> ready </em> for another baby. Rio was eleven when they broke the news to her. She tried not to show her disappointment, certain that her parents’ very scant free time will be all used up for the new baby, making her even more neglected than she already was.</p><p>She was only kind of wrong.</p><p>When Dulce was born (named for the majority of her mother’s cravings, which consisted mainly of chocolate and other kinds of candy and pastries), their parents showered her with love and affection for the first year or so of her life, but Rio was still expected to help. She was taught to change diapers and do feedings all hours of the day – including school nights. It wasn’t long until she was practically a single mother at the age of thirteen, getting Dulce dressed in the mornings before dropping her off at daycare on her way to work.</p><p>Dulce’s first word wasn’t mama or dada; it was Rio. </p><p>Well, technically, it was “Wee-oh” but it still upset her parents – especially her mom.</p><p>For a few months after that, Rio’s mother spend as much time with Dulce as possible, attempting to get her to say mama or dada and showering her with affection and gifts while still handing her off to Rio for diaper changes. She attempted to get back to breast-feeding, but Rio shut that down. She had<em> just </em> gotten Dulce used to a cuppy in place of a bottle.</p><p>Besides, nothing she tried really helped. As far as Dulce knew, the two adults that lived in their house with them were just <em> there </em> . They paid all the bills and the mortgage, but <em> Rio </em> was the one who stayed up with her at night when she had a cough. <em> Rio </em> was the one who sang her lullabies and read her bedtime stories. It was <em> Rio </em> who had taught her how to use the potty and tie her shoes. <em> Rio </em> had pressed kisses to her skinned knee the first time Dulce fell off her tricycle. <em> Rio </em> had clipped her first picture to the refrigerator when Dulce was three and drew a face with a bunch of lines coming out of it.</p><p>“Is this the sun?” Rio had gushed in a singsong voice as she placed it on the fridge with a rainbow magnet.</p><p>“Spider!” Dulce corrected.</p><p>“Oh, silly Riri!” Rio had said, bonking her own head while her baby sister giggled.</p><p>Rio had somehow still been able to take part in basketball, toting Dulce with her to practices and games. Dulce had been a good kid, sitting with her juice and Goldfish and a coloring book in the stands while Rio and her teammates had run drills. She’d sat with some of Rio’s friends during games (her parents rarely attended anything they didn’t <em> need </em> to be at) and cheered whenever Rio made a basket. Afterward, Rio would teach her how to play the game, even though Dulce was just barely bigger than the basketball she held in her tiny hands. Rio would pick her up and help her make a basket.</p><p>She <em> did </em> get a lot of attention from girls from toting around an adorably-dimpled toddler after basketball games. They’d buy Dulce milkshakes and french fries at the local diner after games, cooing at her and telling her how cute she was and how much she looked like her big sister – which she did. Dulce was practically Rio’s little mini-me. </p><p>As college approached, Rio was offered several scholarships from the bigger universities for her basketball prowess, but the thought of going as far as UCLA to play made her stomach clench. She just couldn’t imagine being that far away from Dulce.</p><p>Instead, she went to a nearby state school, commuting all four years and making enough time to do Dulce’s typical bedtime routine. She never wanted anything to change too drastically for the little girl.</p><p>Her parents took over a little bit while she was in college (minimally) and couldn’t spend all her time making sure that Dulce was getting her homework done or getting her nutrients or going to be on time. They acted like a fun uncle and aunt, taking her out on fun excursions and letting her eat way too much junk food that made her sick (which they left Rio to deal with) and even attended a few of Dulce’s parent-teacher conferences (which Rio had previously attended to, telling the teachers that her parents worked long hours in the past) and her mother was practically beaming with pride when she told Rio that they wanted to place Dulce on an advanced track.</p><p>“They said she’s doing <em> so well </em> in all her subjects, my little <em> dulcita </em> ,” she cooed, pinching Dulce’s cheek. Dulce shrugged her off, shyly, still not familiar with her mother’s affection. She <em> hated </em> being called ‘dulcita’. Of course, her mother didn’t know that. How could she?</p><p>“Are you a smarty-pants?” Rio had cooed, hoisting her six-year-old sister onto her hips and poking her in the belly. “Are you a baby genius?”</p><p>“I’m not a baby!” Dulce had insisted. “I’m a big girl! I can ride a two-wheeler now.”</p><p>“Ooh, that’s right,” Rio said, as if she’d just remembered. “I totally forgot. Okay, well, do you <em> want </em> to go into the smarty-pants classes? Is that something you might enjoy?”</p><p>“I dunno…” Dulce had said, pressing her face into Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“You don’t know?” Rio gasped, tickling her until she squealed. “Well, do you wanna learn more stuff at school?”</p><p>“Yeah…” Dulce said. “But what if the other kids don’t like me? What if they think I’m annoying?”</p><p>Dulce was only in first grade, but there were a lot of kids who knew her as a know-it-all because she absorbed information so quickly, like a sponge. They made fun of her for it.</p><p>“Well, that’s the best part!” Rio cooed, carrying her to the fridge and taking out a juice pouch for her. “This is a special class with kids that are just like <em> you </em>.”</p><p>“Juice?” Dulce asked, her eyes wide. It was after five already, and Rio <em> never </em> let her have sugar after five.</p><p>Of course <em> that </em> would be the thing she focused on.</p><p>“Of course, Miss Smarty Pants,” Rio said. “You deserve a treat for being so smart, and sugar helps the brain be smart – but only in moderation.” Dulce nodded, making grabby hands for the juice. Rio stuck the straw in and handed it over, placing a kiss on her temple as she sat her down at the kitchen table. Her parents had already wandered elsewhere in the house, resigned to the knowledge that Rio had all of Dulce’s attention now, as always.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, sitting down next to her, “do you wanna do the smarty-pants class?”</p><p>“I get to choose?” Dulce asked, brown eyes wide with wonder. She so rarely had a choice in things like this, outside what she wore in the morning and what songs Rio sang her at night.</p><p>“Of course you do,” Rio said. “This is going to be your everyday life, isn’t it? You’re the one who is gonna have to go to school every day and learn with the other kids. And they’re all gonna be smarty-pantses, too.”</p><p>“They are?” Dulce asked around her straw.</p><p>“Of course,” Rio said, slipping her laptop out of her bag to subtly start her homework. “They’re all gonna be in the smarty-pants class, so they’re all gonna be smarty-pantses.”</p><p>“That makes sense,” Dulce said, sipping her juice. “Do you think they’ll wanna be my friends?”</p><p>“I don’t know why they wouldn’t be,” Rio said, softly, reaching out to push a lock of Dulce’s wavy black hair behind her ear. “You are such a cool kid.”</p><p>“The kids in my <em> other </em> class don’t like me,” Dulce muttered, looking down.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, tucking a finger under her chin to make her look her in the eye. “It’s not that they don’t like you,” she said. “It’s that they don’t understand you. These kids will, okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” Dulce said. “Then I’ll do it.”</p><p>“That’s my girl!” Rio exclaimed, grabbing her in a hug and pressing kisses to her dimpled cheeks. “Now, what do you want for dinner?”</p><p>It had been as simple as that. Dulce had gotten into the accelerated program, which was probably the best decision they’d ever made. By the time Rio was graduating undergrad (on crutches because of an ACL tear at her very last game, which was <em> amazing </em> timing), Dulce was graduating junior high at only ten years old. By fourteen, she was in college, where she finally slowed down a little bit – but not by that much.</p><p>When Rio was twenty-five, she received her master’s in botany and was considering a PhD when her parents decided to kick her to the curb, claiming that she was far too old to be living at home. </p><p>Dulce obviously rioted at this. Rio had never seen her sister throw a fit quite like the one Dulce threw at the notion of her beloved older sister being forced to move out of their shared childhood home. She was thirteen years old at that point, but she acted like a toddler, knocking things off of shelves and stomping her foot and screaming at her parents the way she never had.</p><p>Naturally, their parents blamed Rio for this, telling her that she’d been a bad influence, that she had <em> spoiled </em> Dulce to a ridiculous extent.</p><p>Rio had laughed in their faces at that, pointing out that, because of <em> her, </em> Dulce was about to graduate high school <em> with honors </em> and already had several scholarships to get her through both a bachelor’s and master’s degree of her own. She reminded them who exactly had changed Dulce’s diapers, had fed her, had taken her to doctor’s appointments, had dropped her off and picked her up from school, had acted as a mother to <em> their </em> child while they were off doing whatever the fuck <em> they </em> wanted to do. Rio had been the strict one in the household, setting bedtimes and curfews while <em> they </em> had encouraged her to eat too much candy and stay up late, getting in the way of her studies. </p><p>“Then <em> take </em> her with you!” her mother had roared at her, stunning both Dulce and Rio into silence.</p><p>Rio and Dulce had just looked at her, then each other, slow smiles spreading over their lips.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio had said. “I will.”</p><p>The process to take legal guardianship over her younger sister hadn’t been as difficult as she’d been expecting. Her parents paid child support and Rio found a job as a florist and an apartment for them to share, for which her parents also paid half the rent. She had expected her mother to take back her words almost as soon as they were spoken, but her parents were surprisingly willing to let Dulce go with her, even to throw money at them to make it easier, so long as they no longer had to care for them.</p><p>Rio had put Dulce into therapy as soon as possible despite the teen insisting that she didn’t need it. Rio didn’t believe her and it was covered by their insurance, so it wasn’t like she’d be wasting money on it. </p><p>Dulce saw her therapist for a year during her freshman year in college, but she quit therapy in the summer between freshman and sophomore year, insisting that it was only taking time away from her studies and her photography hobby, which really started to pick up after she took a photography class during her spring semester.</p><p>As with most things, Dulce was a prodigy. It took her no time at all to learn how to use the expensive, artsy cameras that the university lent out for their classes, and pretty soon her work was featured in the university’s tiny student-run art gallery <em> and </em> their art magazine. Rio stuck those articles on the fridge in their apartment, much to her teen sister’s embarrassment. </p><p>Before long, Dulce graduated college at age eighteen, the same age as the incoming freshman, and moved to New York to attend grad school at Columbia, where she got her MFA in Photography. She still came home every weekend to spend time with Rio and support her as she started performing at open mics around New Jersey. </p><p>When Rio got a steady gig at <em> The Witches’ Road </em> , Dulce made a point to be there every single week to see her show. She’d only missed a handful so far, including the previous Saturday. She had to practically <em> force </em> Rio not to cancel her standup for her showcase.</p><p>“You can go to the gallery anytime to see the prints they’ve got in the gift shop. Hell, if I don’t sell the original, you can see that, too! It’s no big deal.”</p><p>Rio had grumbled a lot about it, but she’d gone to her show, talking about raising an ungrateful brat, but in an affectionate way. She’d made Alice take a video of it to show Dulce when she got home, receiving that playful pout from her baby sister. Dulce had then raved about the owner of the gallery (Rio could <em> swear </em> she’d never said Agatha’s name) complimenting her piece and her talent and assured Rio it definitely <em> wouldn’t </em> be her last showcase there.</p><p>Rio was certain of that, too. </p><p>“So,” Dulce said, as she sat upright on the couch, welcoming Swan into her lap, where she immediately stretched out across her legs, “when are you going on tour?”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Why would I do that? I’ve got a nice regular gig in Westview and an irritating little sister to look after.”</p><p>“I’m not a baby, Rio,” Dulce huffed, crossing her arms over her chest. “I can handle myself for a few weeks while you go out and make some real money.”</p><p>“I make plenty at <em> The Witches’ Road </em>,” Rio insisted.</p><p>“Your TikToks are blowing up, you know,” Dulce said, sliding her phone out of her pocket to show her. “There are a <em> lot </em> of lesbians eager to meet the sexy gay comedian girl, but they’re all stuck in the midwest. You could get a lot of–”</p><p>“Watch your mouth,” Rio said, using her hand to muffle her words. Dulce glared at her and licked her palm. </p><p>Rio immediately recoiled. “Ugh!” she exclaimed. “I rue the day I ever taught you that.” She wiped her hand on Dulce’s sleeve and Dulce shoved her away, laughing.</p><p>“Come on, Riri!” Dulce groaned. “Don’t you wanna branch out a little bit. There is probably a <em> world </em> of other plant lesbians who love lame puns just as much as you do.” She motioned to Rio’s shirt, which was one of many with similar dirty plant jokes. “You could get laid <em> so </em> much if you just left Westview for a little bit.”</p><p>“I’m fine for now,” Rio chuckled. “I have everything I need right here.” She wrapped her arms around Dulce, pulling her into a tight embrace. Dulce sighed but didn’t resist for even a second, pressing her cheek to Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“I’m not letting this go, you know,” she said, even as she relaxed. </p><p>“I know,” Rio said, patting her head and grinning as she reached for the remote. “So what are we watching?”</p>

<span>Agatha didn’t go to work on Tuesday.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t like she was needed there, anyway. Their next showcase wasn’t for another two weeks, and Jen was handling all the logistics of this one. She was probably already sitting in her office, making phone calls and whatnot. She was definitely still texting Agatha about the previous night’s group therapy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored the chime of her phone strapped to her arm as she ran through the park, keeping her breaths even and in time with her steps as her feet pounded the pavement. It was nice out and she was going to enjoy this run, dammit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While she still could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook off that thought, literally feeling her ponytail whack her in the face as she kept going. She focused on the path in front of her, on dodging walkers with dogs and parents pushing strollers. She waved at a little girl who waved at her as she passed, offering her a kind smile and a goofy face that made her giggle. She jumped over a branch in the middle of the path, never breaking her stride. She weaved around a kid attempting to do some kind of trick on his skateboard. She brushed shoulders with another runner as she passed him and ignored the flirty smile he sent her way, pointing to the lesbian pride flag design of the armband keeping her phone in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily, he was smart enough not to pursue…or maybe he just wasn’t quick enough to catch up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The park wasn’t huge. Agatha didn’t think it even stretched a quarter-mile from one end to the other in any direction, but the paths that had been built around it and going through it were windy and split in many different directions. Agatha probably wouldn’t have been surprised to learn that she’d never taken the same jog twice through the park. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a playground that she passed sometimes. It was small, but it almost always had kids playing on it, even early in the morning, before school. There was also a school right across the street from the park, so the playground was probably an extension of that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a duck pond where people had picnics in the early afternoons, tossing seeds and breadcrumbs to the duck families swimming and waddling around. They were loud, but at least they didn’t poop on the path as far as Agatha could see.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There were benches </span>
<em>
<span>everywhere</span>
</em>
<span> in the park, dotting the path. They were mostly taken up by the elderly, but there were also some younger couples who sat together, holding hands and being gross. Agatha did her best to ignore them and the thought that it had been well over a year since she’d really had a date, let alone a girlfriend.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that thought brought her back to the previous night, to the room full of women. To </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All of the women in that room were unfairly hot, but Rio Vidal was…something else. And she had kept </span>
<em>
<span>staring</span>
</em>
<span> at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That had to mean something, didn’t it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hoped that </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> was positive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she’d said that she would </span>
<em>
<span>maybe</span>
</em>
<span> drop by. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Agatha had said good. </span>
<em>
<span>Good</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned at the memory, her stride stuttering just slightly before she picked up speed. She checked her smartwatch and saw that she had been running for 4.65 miles so far. It was about time to wrap up and head home, she decided. She’d end at five miles and call it a day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, a </span>
<em>
<span>morning</span>
</em>
<span>. It wasn’t even ten yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took the next path to her left, in the direction of her house, and kept going, checking her watch every few moments, watching the distance tick higher and higher as she reached the edge of the park. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, she knew she would reach the sidewalk before she reached her goal, so she took a sharp right onto an arching path that would tack on a good .05 miles onto her run and give her the extra distance she needed to reach her - </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped a little at the sound of her name and she turned to see none other than Rio Vidal grinning at her. She was dressed similarly to how she’d been the night before, in torn jeans (these ones were lighter and baggier) and a deep green shirt with another plant pun on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pot Head” it said, pictured with a series of drawings of potted plants on it, all with suggestively red eyes. Agatha snorted at it automatically, then cleared her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said, feeling her cheeks warm up. “Rio, right?” As if she’d </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> forgotten the name of the woman she hadn’t been able to stop thinking about since the previous name. The woman she had practically </span>
<em>
<span>sprinted</span>
</em>
<span> from the second the meeting was over (after Wanda let her go, anyway).</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio laughed, and that </span>
<em>
<span>sound</span>
</em>
<span>. How did a laugh sound like music? It was such a casual sound, too, but beautiful. Agatha wanted to drown in it. “Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh </span>
<em>
<span>Goddess</span>
</em>
<span>, when did she become a poet? She </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> poetry. She was </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> a writer. She couldn’t understand words as well as paintings, as drawings, as photographs. A picture was worth a </span>
<em>
<span>million</span>
</em>
<span> words in her opinion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What brings you to the park, Rio?” Agatha asked, jogging in place. It wouldn’t make her mile counter go up, but at least the steps would.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Community garden,” Rio retorted, motioning to the green area just inside the curving path, which was a tiny flower garden, with vibrant coloring. “I was just checking on my azaleas. They’re coming along well, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha almost stopped jogging in place at that. She was the one who grew the azaleas in the park? Agatha loved those flowers. She took a detour past them whenever she was having a crappy morning. They were not quite in bloom just yet, but they still looked good and healthy, their stems a vibrant green. The bush took up a third of the tiny patch of land, sitting next to a patch of…well, Agatha didn’t really know other flowers, to be honest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Azaleas had been her grandmother’s favorite, so they were also Agatha’s favorite, if only because they reminded her of Gran.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They do look nice,” Agatha agreed, still jogging in place, hoping that the flush that she could feel spreading from her neck to the tips of her ears could be played off as a result of her physical activity. “How long have you been growing them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, casually. “Since undergrad,” she said. “We had an assignment in my first botany class to grow a flower. That was it. That was the </span>
<em>
<span>whole</span>
</em>
<span> assignment.” Rio laughed, her cheeks turning pink. “I went to the hardware store and there was a pack of discounted seeds there. The guy told me that they were from a bad batch and were just trying to get rid of them, but he didn’t think the flowers they’d produce would really turn into anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m guessing,” Agatha said, looking at the flowers, “you took that as a challenge.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, one </span>
<em>
<span>hundred</span>
</em>
<span> percent,” Rio chuckled, crossing one leg over the other and subtly massaging her ankle. She was wearing white Keds with little doodles sketched on the sides in pen. It made Agatha smile slightly. “I spent so much time on that first batch of azaleas, knowing that I would probably fail my assignment if they never even sprouted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But they did?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio said, nodding, “but they were </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> pretty. Not like these.” She motioned to the currently rooted azalea bush. “I got a good grade, though. Mainly because I took good notes and photographed every step of the process of growing the flowers. My professor was impressed when she saw what the seeds had looked like, too. She said getting even </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> bud from that was a feat in and of itself. But I got </span>
<em>
<span>six</span>
</em>
<span> perfectly fine flowers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Impressive,” Agatha said. At some point, she’d stopped jogging in place and now stood, her arms folded over her chest as she listened to Rio’s story. She had a soothing voice and an electric look in her eyes as she talked about it. “I never would have taken you for a botany student.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Rio snorted, motioning to her shirt. “</span>
<em>
<span>Never</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, a plant girl, no doubt,” Agatha laughed. “And you’re a comedian, so the puns on your shirt are </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> to be expected, but you studied </span>
<em>
<span>botany</span>
</em>
<span>? Did you ever get your PhD?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was going to,” Rio said, “but life had other plans.” She shrugged but didn’t elaborate. “I’m doing pretty well for myself now, though. I still get to work with plants sometimes, in my own time. I even sell them on occasion. And I get to spend my weekends making people laugh, so it’s a win-win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suppose so,” Agatha hummed, nodding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about you?” Rio asked. “Did you ever think about getting a PhD?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In Art?” Agatha snorted. “Not really. A Master’s in Art History was enough to open the gallery. Making myself an art </span>
<em>
<span>doctor</span>
</em>
<span> just felt like overkill.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about your partner?” Rio asked, reaching for a styrofoam coffee cup that Agatha hadn’t previously seen and taking a sip. Agatha wasn’t too concerned by that, though. She was more focused on the emphasis Rio had placed on the word ‘partner’. It was subtle, but Agatha was certain she hadn’t imagined it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then it clicked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thought that Jen was…no. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Absolutely not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was </span>
<em>
<span>one time</span>
</em>
<span> and Jen still hadn’t let her live it down!</span>
</p><p>
<span>Never again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> actually get her PhD,” Agatha said, trying to sound casual and not inject </span>
<em>
<span>any</span>
</em>
<span> affection into Jen’s name. It really wasn’t that hard. “But that’s only because her parents were paying for everything and she also got herself a degree in chemistry so she could make her own paint. Overachiever, that one.” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’d you two meet?” Rio asked, and Agatha could swear she heard an edge to her voice. She wasn’t doing the best job at convincing Rio that Jen was </span>
<em>
<span>just</span>
</em>
<span> a partner. A </span>
<em>
<span>business</span>
</em>
<span> partner. </span>
<em>
<span>Not</span>
</em>
<span> a </span>
<em>
<span>life</span>
</em>
<span> partner – gross.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“College,” Agatha said, and thought better than to elaborate on their one-night stand and then her ghosting Jen until graduation. It definitely wouldn’t help her case.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why did she care if Rio thought she and Jen were an item?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Did she?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit back a groan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um, we met during junior year, both studying art history. After undergrad, we started spending more time together and eventually found ourselves in similar classes in grad school. Jen was studying more chemistry to ‘enhance’ her art,” Agatha rolled her eyes, “but I was also taking a few business classes. After grad school, we decided to put our brains – and our respective bank accounts – together and buy the gallery downtown. It took a lot of fixing up, but it’s been doing well for the last five years, and Jen lives close to it in case of any emergencies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to </span>
<em>
<span>subtly</span>
</em>
<span> emphasize the fact that she and Jen </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> weren’t living together to Rio, her eyes widening slightly for about half a second before she cleared her throat with a soft shrug. She couldn’t tell if it was getting through to Rio at all, but she didn’t want to come right out and say that she had no romantic feelings for Jen Kale at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because why would </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> matter?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just nodded. “Pretty impressive,” she said. “Running a successful art gallery right out of grad school, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, technically,” Agatha said, “I still had to wait another year or two until Jen was done with her PhD. We did buy the place immediately, but there was a lot of construction that had to be done, as well. It was </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> in good shape when we signed the papers. Jen’s parents more or less bankrolled us for the duration of the construction.” She took a deep breath. “I’m still paying them back for it all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They refused to accept whatever money Agatha tried to give them, so she ended up just slipping wads of cash into Naomi Kale’s purse whenever she showed up to whisk Agatha and Jen off for a nice lunch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Naomi never said anything, but she always showed up with </span>
<em>
<span>really nice gifts</span>
</em>
<span> the next time she came around. They were always suspiciously worth exactly what Agatha had given her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was not allowed to refuse them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a fun game they played.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you </span>
<em>
<span>must</span>
</em>
<span> be doing well,” Rio said. “My sister loves that gallery. Actually, she just–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s phone chirped in her pocket at that second and she gave Rio an apologetic smile as she reached for it, unstrapping it from her arm to see a text from Jen, as if her fucking </span>
<em>
<span>ears</span>
</em>
<span> had been burning or something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Speak of the she-devil,” Agatha sighed, reading the text that Jen had sent it. It read: “SOS. 911. EMERGENCY! COME QUICK! NOW!” in several different blue bubbles, with another on the way, the little ellipses doing a wave as Jen constructed the next text. “Okay,” Agatha said, eyes wide. “I am so sorry, but I actually have to go. Jen is panicking about…</span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>. I’m,” she looked back at Rio, seriously reluctant to leave this conversation until she was certain that Rio knew that she and Jen were </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> an item.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Jen was about to have a heart attack, it seemed. So…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go ahead,” Rio said. “I’ll see you at the next meeting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a question. It was a statement, like Agatha’s presence at the next group therapy session was a given, a sure thing. Something even glimmered in Rio’s eyes – something like </span>
<em>
<span>hope</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t want to read too much into it, but that glimmer made her heart flutter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she said, strapping her phone back to her arm. “Yes, definitely. I’ll see you at the next meeting.” She nodded, clearing her throat. “Bye, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bye, Agatha,” Rio replied, giving her a lopsided smirk, that adorable little gap showing between her front teeth. Agatha wondered what it would be like to run her tongue–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone chirped several more times and she rolled her eyes, waving to Rio with a bemused smile as she started to jog away, toward the gallery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel Rio’s eyes on her back practically until she left the park.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong?” Agatha asked, bursting through the door to Jen’s office. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a split office. It had once been a large room in the gallery, near the reception desk, but Agatha and Jen had decided that it was big enough to split down the middle into two smaller offices. One of the offices (Agatha’s) had a private bathroom, which Jen had been upset about losing in a game of rock, paper, scissors, while the other had windows. Agatha liked not having windows in her office, though. She didn’t need people walking down Main Street seeing inside her office. Gross.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen liked her windows, which were floor-to-ceiling and faced East, so she could do yoga in the mornings she’d shown up early, basking in the rising sun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had not hesitated in calling her a freak for this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, the sun filtered through the windows behind Jen’s desk as she sat there, completely composed, sipping from a hot pink coffee mug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, Agatha,” she said, coolly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning?” Agatha huffed, shutting the door behind her. “</span>
<em>
<span>Good morning</span>
</em>
<span>?! Jen, what’s with all the SOS and ‘emergency’ texts? You made it seem like you were </span>
<em>
<span>dying</span>
</em>
<span> or something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And it still took you ten minutes to arrive,” Jen tutted. “I could have been dead on the floor of a bullet wound by the time you got here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I trust that you would have had enough sense to call 9-1-1 before that happened,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes. “And you texted me right in the middle of my run.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was technically a lie, but Jen didn’t need to know that. She couldn’t see the park from her office, thankfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Also, who the hell owns a gun in Westview that you could annoy enough to shoot you in the middle of a crowded gallery? These walls aren’t soundproof, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still,” Jen said, standing up and walking slowly and methodically around her desk as Agatha watched her. “I could have been in real peril and you just </span>
<em>
<span>left</span>
</em>
<span> me here, hanging.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I ran as fast as I could.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another lie. Agatha could have run faster if she’d tried. They both know that. Her mile record was just under five minutes (but that had left her unable to run for nearly a week due to the soreness in her legs.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you just tell me what you want,” Agatha huffed. “I need to go home and shower. It’s supposed to be my day off, too. I was going to paint.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can leave,” Jen said, still talking as slowly as she walked to the door to her office, “as soon as you tell me what happened at the therapy thing last night.” Agatha heard the click of the door’s lock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think I won’t throw myself out that window?” Agatha huffed, motioning to one of the windows behind the desk. “Because I will. I will take a running leap, Jennifer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be so dramatic,” Jen huffed, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Me</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha sputtered. “</span>
<em>
<span>Dramatic?</span>
</em>
<span> I have nearly </span>
<em>
<span>forty</span>
</em>
<span> texts from you, all with some variation of ‘SOS’ and ‘Save me!’ because what? You wanted </span>
<em>
<span>gossip</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Girl, you </span>
<em>
<span>made me</span>
</em>
<span> drive you to that meeting so that I could bail you out if necessary with some fake emergency. And then you had </span>
<em>
<span>zero</span>
</em>
<span> fake emergencies and still wouldn’t tell me what happened in that meeting. Not that you liked it nor that it was awful. You just said </span>
<em>
<span>drive</span>
</em>
<span> and I drove, like an idiot. What the hell happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Nothing</span>
</em>
<span> happened!” Agatha huffed, turning away from Jen and padding to a loveseat to the left of the office door. She dropped heavily down onto it. “It was fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Fine</span>
</em>
<span>?” Jen huffed. “</span>
<em>
<span>Just fine</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “Yeah,” she said. “The women were…normal. We barely talked about MS. It was mostly about everybody’s personal lives and shit. I didn’t think they’d want me to share that with an outsider.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“An </span>
<em>
<span>outsider</span>
</em>
<span>?” Jen scoffed. “Okay, now that sounds like a cult. Did you accidentally join some MS cult? Do you need help? Blink twice if you need help, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a cackle, shaking her head. “And you’re calling </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span> dramatic,” she snorted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, Agatha!” Jen huffed, dropping down beside her on the cult. “Tell me just </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> thing about the meeting. Please?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you want to know about what happens there so badly,” Agatha retorted, “just come to the next one with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now why the hell did she have to go and say some dumb shit like that? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s eyes widened in shock. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Am I allowed to do that?” she asked. “Even if I don’t have MS?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “One of the women brought her sister with her, which she apparently does on a regular basis. Her sister drives her there, though, because she can’t drive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are any of them hot?” Jen asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen!” Agatha huffed. “They’re not there to find hot dates or anything! They’re there for community or what the fuck ever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t answer my question,” Jen retorted. Agatha rolled her eyes, but she felt her cheeks warm. “Ooh, there </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> somebody hot there, isn’t there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s a lot of hot somebodies there,” Agatha admitted. “They’re all pretty attractive. Unfairly so.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But there’s somebody specific that you thought of just now, isn’t there?” Jen teased, poking Agatha’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ouch!” Agatha huffed, pulling away. “Why are your fingers so bony? You need to eat more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t deflect,” Jen said. “Tell me about her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would I do that?” Agatha huffed. “Especially if you’re planning on coming to the next meeting. I don’t need you embarrassing me in front of them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, babe,” Jen cooed, patting Agatha’s knee. “I’m gonna do that anyway. You might as well tell me who it is now because I will </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> know the second I see her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not a chance,” Agatha huffed, standing up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen reached up, tugging her back down by the arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One thing,” she said, “just tell me one thing about one of the women in the group and I will leave you alone until Thursday. It doesn’t even have to be the one you have a crush on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t have a cru–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t lie to me,” Jen said. “I </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> when you’re lying, Agatha. You have a tell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very inconvenient for you,” Jen retorted. “Now, </span>
<em>
<span>spill</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha grunted, crossing her arms over her chest. “Um…two of them are veterans, but one was born in England and the other was born in Canada.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are either of them hot?” Jen asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goddess, you’re shallow,” Agatha muttered. “Yes, they are both kinda hot. One of them is in her fifties.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh,” Jen said, cheeks pinkening, “mature woman. </span>
<em>
<span>Very </span>
</em>
<span>hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s married.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Boo,” Jen said, pouting. “To a man or a woman?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I…have no idea, actually,” Agatha admitted. “She just said ‘spouse’ when she was introducing herself. I think I just assumed she was married to a man, but…well, she could probably swing both ways.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So I have a chance?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha snorted. “She’s still </span>
<em>
<span>married</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe she’s poly,” Jen said. “You never know. Besides, she’s probably not the </span>
<em>
<span>only</span>
</em>
<span> hot one there. Is the other vet hot?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha sighed. “She’s also older.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fifties?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Late thirties, if I recall correctly. I’m apparently the baby of the group at 29.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So they’re </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> older?” Jen’s eyes sparkled with lust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep it in your pants, Kale,” Agatha said, shoving her shoulder. “You will </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> embarrass me in front of these women.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t dream of it, Aggie,” Jen said, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s shoulders and holding on tight even as Agatha attempted to loosen her hold. “I’m just going to be there to support my dear friend in her time of need. All the hot older women are just a bonus….how many are there, anyway?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did the mental math, trying to remember the layout of the circle from the night before. “Including me,” she said, “there are eight. Of those eight, only seven have MS. One is just the younger sister.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, we could say that I’m </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> sister,” Jen said. “I mean, you’re already practically my mother’s favorite child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As true as that may be,” Agatha said, “I don’t think </span>
<em>
<span>anybody</span>
</em>
<span> is gonna buy that you and I are sisters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Adoption exists, Agatha,” Jen huffed. “Besides, you’re </span>
<em>
<span>practically</span>
</em>
<span> my sister.” She hugged Agatha again, and this time Agatha didn’t attempt to escape from her grasp, but she also didn’t sink into it. She rolled her eyes, somewhat affectionately, before wriggling out of Jen’s embrace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, alright,” she said, “you can come and be my ‘support’ or whatever, but I swear to god, Jen, you better keep it in your pants during the meeting. Those women are </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> there for that. Got it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen gave her a tiny salute. Agatha flipped her off in response as she made her way to the door, unlocking it before she stepped out without a goodbye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like a good sister, though, she turned off the lights in the office and left the door wide open as she left.</span>

<b>Chapter Six</b>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dressed more casually for the second meeting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She still wore unripped jeans, but she’d opted for a t-shirt with a floral pattern that looked as though it were drawn in chalk. It was a little bit faded and Agatha couldn’t tell you what flowers were drawn on it, but she’d bet that Rio could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that it mattered if Rio could, of course. Not that she was even trying to get Rio’s attention with the shirt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shut up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hair was hastily put up into a messy bun that somehow looked almost elegant, even though there were tendrils falling out all over the place. In the mirror, she looked almost put together. Almost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked like a Calvin Klein model in a bright pink tracksuit – as per usual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re going to the community center,” Agatha huffed as she slid into Jen’s pink subaru. “You realize that, right? The place that apparently smells like feet, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If there’s gonna be hot, potentially queer, older ladies there, then I’m gonna look like their potential, controversially-young girlfriend,” Jen retorted, batting her eyelashes at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good Goddess,” Agatha muttered as they pulled away from the curb. “You are ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t even pretend like you’re not hoping to bag </span>
<em>
<span>your own</span>
</em>
<span> hottie there,” Jen huffed. “What’s her name again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice try,” Agatha snorted. “I didn’t give you a name, nor will I.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” Jen said. “I’ll definitely know her when I see her, anyway. You are </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> subtle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Been there, done that. Not impressed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bitch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Cunt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were silent after that, but they had matching smirks on their faces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they got to the community center, the lot was more or less empty. Jen pulled in the spot closest to the door, just barely staying within the painted white lines, which Agatha made sure to mock her for as they walked toward the front door. It was more to distract herself from her nervously pounding heart than anything else, though. She could do this so long as she got to make fun of Jen for at least </span>
<em>
<span>part</span>
</em>
<span> of the time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t there yet when they stepped inside, which brought Agatha some small degree of relief as she led Jen toward the refreshment table, which had chocolate chip cookies this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, cookies,” Jen said, immediately grabbing a handful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are other people here, you know,” Agatha murmured as she filled a cup with coffee and then topped it with oatmilk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said there were less than a dozen,” Jen reminded her. “That’s a </span>
<em>
<span>lot</span>
</em>
<span> of cookies for less than a dozen people. I’m sure they won’t starve.” She shoved a whole cookie into her mouth and started chewing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really think you’re going to win a controversially-older girlfriend by shoving cookies into your maw?” Agatha snorted, taking a sip of her coffee and snatching a cookie from Jen’s hand, which resulted in a strangled sound of dismay from the taller woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snickered as she took a big bite of the stolen cookie and walked away, taking a seat in the circle. Yelena and Natasha were already seated, speaking animatedly in Russian again, their hands flying around them, brows furrowed like they were fighting, but then Yelena started laughing at something Natasha said and they both dissolved into girlish giggles, holding each other like they would fall if they both let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sisters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was also there already, her phone held up to her ear as she cooed something to the person on the other end – probably one or both of her sons.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Others filed in, making their way to the circle. Peggy and Maria entered together, talking about something or other as they grabbed their own refreshments and headed to their seats, smiling at Agatha in greeting as they passed. Agatha smiled back, politely. Alice slumped through the circle, taking her spot across from Agatha, just as she had the last time. She offered Agatha a nod and a smirk as she sat down, then her eyes went oddly wide as she spotted something over Agatha’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to see Jen talking to…</span>
<em>
<span>shit</span>
</em>
<span>. Rio was at the refreshments table, holding a cup of tea in one hand and a cane in the other as she laughed about whatever it was that Jen was saying (Jen wasn’t even that funny, what the hell???) and limped toward the circle with her. When she caught Agatha’s eye, her step stuttered a little bit and she smiled – not </span>
<em>
<span>smirked</span>
</em>
<span>, smiled – and gave her a nod as she said her goodbyes to Jen and made her way over to sit next to Alice, whose cheeks were pink now as she continued to stare not at Rio, but at Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s that?” Jen whispered, nodding to the two women.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I assume she would have introduced herself, no?” Agatha retorted, taking a casual sip of her coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not the one with the cane,” Jen huffed. “The little one. Her friend. Who is she? She looks familiar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s Alice Wu-Gulliver,” Agatha said. “Though Wanda will probably have her introduce herself to you since you’re ‘new’.” Her fingers curled around the word new. Jen was technically just there as her support, after all. She wondered if Wanda would still go through the whole thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wu as in…</span>
<em>
<span>Lorna</span>
</em>
<span> Wu?” Jen gasped. “Seriously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wu is a pretty common name, you know,” Agatha retorted. “It’s pretty racist of you to assume that they’re related.” Jen glared at her as she took another long sip of her drink. “Yeah, that’s her daughter,” Agatha finally said after a long moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh,” Jen said, her eyes lighting up. “Well, she’s got her mom’s looks, that’s for sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not her height,” Agatha murmured behind the rim of her cup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Jen snorted, but her eyes stayed glued to Alice, who had looked away, avoiding eye contact as if suddenly nervous. “I like them fun-sized.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gross, Jen,” Agatha huffed, wrinkling her nose. She shoved Jen’s shoulder and scooted her chair away from her as Jen cackled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see we have a new face here today!” Wanda exclaimed, clapping her hands. “Welcome!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Jen said, her cheeks darkening as her eyes went wide. “No. I mean, I </span>
<em>
<span>am</span>
</em>
<span> new, but I don’t…I, uh, I’m not…” She shook her head, laughing nervously as she scratched the back of her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen doesn’t have MS,” Agatha said. “She’s just here for emotional support.” Agatha patted her thigh twice, then pulled away, glancing at Rio. “She’s my work partner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But we’re more than </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>!” Jen huffed, wrapping her arms around Agatha and pulling her into a tight hug that Agatha immediately tried to escape from. “We’re </span>
<em>
<span>sisters</span>
</em>
<span>.” She kissed the top of Agatha’s head, which earned her a shove as Agatha’s face went red and a few chuckles went up around the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not biologically-speaking, obviously,” Agatha huffed, brushing off her shirt as though there were some kind of Jennifer Kale residue left behind on her. “But we </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> known each other since college and I </span>
<em>
<span>am</span>
</em>
<span> her mother’s favorite child.” Jen made a sound of indignation. “You said so yourself,” Agatha reminded her. “Two days ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” Jen huffed, rolling her eyes. “For some reason, I decided to go into business with this…” she twisted her lips up as she tried to find the word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is the average amount of time it takes for her to find something nice to say,” Agatha said, earning laughter all around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only about you,” Jen retorted, earning more laughs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sisters alright,” Natasha said, nodding. She and Yelena tapped their coffees together in agreement. More laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, it’s nice to meet you,” Wanda said. “I’m sorry, what’s your name again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jennifer,” Jen said. “Jennifer Kale. Jen, preferably.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome, Jen,” Wanda said. “I’m sure Agatha has told you all about our group.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, actually,” Jen said. “She hasn’t.” She gave Agatha a look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s my understanding,” Agatha said, ignoring her, “that everything said here is personal and should not be shared outside this group.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s group therapy, Agatha,” Jen huffed. “Not Alcoholics Anonymous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s kinda correct, though,” Maria said. “Therapy is usually supposed to stay just within the group you’re sharing with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Maria,” Agatha said, holding her coffee cup up to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got you,” Maria replied, pointing at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Wanda laughed. “Then how about we do another quick introduction like we did last time and we’ll move on? Hmm? I’m Wanda Maximoff…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They go through the same introductions they’d done last time, more or less, introducing themselves to Jen in a more succinct manner. It took about a third of the time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When it got to Rio, something in Jen’s gaze shifted as she glanced sideways at Agatha, but she said nothing. Agatha could tell the questions would be coming though. She dreaded those questions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then it was Alice’s turn and Jen was </span>
<em>
<span>riveted</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had honestly never seen Jen react like this to </span>
<em>
<span>anybody</span>
</em>
<span> before. She’d seen Jen go on dates and get into relationships. She’d bought ice cream and rented horrid rom-coms and consoled her through messy break-ups and assured her that she was too good for the women who had broken her heart. She had played wingman at lesbian bars one too many times for comfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she had </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> seen somebody capture Jen Kale’s attention the way Alice Wu-Gulliver currently was. Her hands were currently spasming at her sides, which Alice didn’t even attempt to hide, as she spoke about preparing to go on tour with her mother’s band. She ran her shaky hands through her hair and gave bashful smiles every time she met Jen’s eye, her cheeks going pink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Obviously, Alice was feeling a mutual attraction with Jen. She spoke the longest out of anybody, but mostly that was due to her stuttering and blushing, obviously flustered by Jen’s unwavering attention on her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Next to her, Rio had a shit-eating grin on her face as she sipped her tea and looked between the two of them, then at Agatha, who matched her grin, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>These idiots, right?</span>
</em>
<span> she seemed to communicate as they watched Alice blunder through her introduction before plopping back down in her seat. When Rio patted her shoulder, her hand was slapped away by a blushing Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Wanda said, clapping her hands. “Now that we’ve gotten that over with…welcome, Miss Kale.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Doctor, actually,” Jen said, without an ounce of self-consciousness. “I got my PhD in Chemistry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh,” Wanda cooed. “</span>
<em>
<span>Doctor Kale</span>
</em>
<span>, then. Very impressive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Jen said, preening a little bit as she sipped her drink. Agatha rolled her eyes and caught Rio’s snort from across the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart did a little jolt as she bit into another cookie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bulk of the meeting itself was spent talking about the difficulties of explaining MS to potential employers (in Maria’s case, as she was attempting to change focus in her career) or clients (in Natasha’s case, when it came to explaining her cane to those who doubted her ability to do her job while hobbling around.) Rio also talked about her set for her upcoming show and how she wasn’t sure if the ongoing MS jokes she had for nearly every set were getting old (several of the ladies assured her that they definitely </span>
<em>
<span>weren’t</span>
</em>
<span> getting old) and her sister’s insistence that she should start touring, but she was unsure of it because she didn’t know how accommodating other venues would be to her need for a place to sit or their stage accessibility.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” Jen said, “you have the power to schedule the venues and make sure that they can accommodate you. And you can probably stick close to this area for a while just to get a feel for if you like touring. It doesn’t have to be some huge thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had shrugged at that, blushing as she looked down at her bare knees, which stuck out of her torn jeans. “I know,” she said, “but my sister wouldn’t be able to come on the road with me. And she’s more or less my stage manager. I basically raised that kid. I’ve got her all trained and everything.” There were a few chuckles around the circle, but Agatha could tell it wasn’t fully a joke. Rio was being genuine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe tour on the weekends,” she suggested. “Like Saturday and Sunday, you go to Trenton or somewhere close by where your sister can follow. Not even every weekend, either. Maybe just one or two weekends a month, when she can follow you and you can keep up your semi-regular gig at </span>
<em>
<span>The Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at her, blinking in surprise. “Yeah,” she said, after a long, tense moment, “that might actually work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You just let us all know where you’re going,” Wanda said. “Maybe some of us can come out to support you still, so at least you’ll have some familiar faces in the audience.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That would be nice,” Rio said, with a tiny, shy, </span>
<em>
<span>adorable</span>
</em>
<span> smile, which happened to be partly aimed directly at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen nudged her with her elbow, but Agatha ignored her as she took one last sip of her coffee and then looked down at the toes of her Converse, wondering how far she would go, exactly, to see Rio Vidal, a woman she had known less than a week.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could take a two-hour trip to Trenton, maybe, if it wasn’t a night when they had a showcase…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the meeting was adjourned, Agatha tossed her empty cup and turned to start tugging Jen out only to find that the other woman hadn’t even followed her back to the refreshments table like she’d thought. Instead, she had made a beeline straight for Alice, whose face was pink and smile was wide as she spoke to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could tell from across the room that Jen was flirting </span>
<em>
<span>heavily</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d leave her to it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Boo,” a voice said from behind Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha is not proud to admit that she jumped a little bit as she turned around to find Rio standing before her, smirking. Agatha rolled her eyes, but even she couldn’t fight her own smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I went to the gallery yesterday,” Rio said. “The girl there said that you weren’t in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her stomach flip. Rio had </span>
<em>
<span>asked</span>
</em>
<span> about her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed to be cool.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told her to say that whenever anybody asks if I’m around,” Agatha said, coolly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was not entirely a lie. There were a lot of entitled rich people who thought that they could buy the artwork right off the walls the instant they saw it. Many of them were willing to offer far too much money for said art pieces. Agatha didn’t like dealing with them. She let Jen do it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, however, it seemed to have bitten her in the ass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Though what she would have said to Rio if she showed up at her gallery was beyond her at the moment…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Afraid of crazed fans or something?” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re </span>
<em>
<span>relentless</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes even as she grinned. She eyed Jen and Alice, who were both blushing as they spoke in hushed voices, closer together than they’d been just a moment ago. “What do you think that’s all about?” she asked Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Rio’s gaze followed Agatha’s line of sight and she grinned at their friends. “Oh. Alice is definitely smitten.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Smitten?” Agatha snorted. “What a cutesy way of putting it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s the most accurate word to describe it, I think,” Rio chuckled. “I mean, look at that and tell me that’s not the textbook definition of smitten.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took another long look. Alice’s cheeks were bright pink and she was actually </span>
<em>
<span>twirling</span>
</em>
<span> a lock of hair around her finger, like a schoolgirl with a crush. She was smiling up at Jen like she hung the moon, and Jen wasn’t faring much better, stooping a little bit toward Alice to be closer to her level, her fingers twitching at her sides, probably regretting the decision to wear her hot pink tracksuit without pockets in the pants so that she could hide them. It looked as though she’d rather reach for Alice’s hands or face or whatever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pathetic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Rio said, “if I come tomorrow and I ask for you, will you come out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked at her, feeling her pulse thrum in her throat and her tongue dry up at the mere prospect of walking out of her office and seeing Rio there, waiting for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was smiling at Agatha, almost as shyly as Agatha had been smiling at her, in her ripped jeans and her dozen piercings and her cute, punny plant shirt (“Sometimes, I Wet my Plants” it said, with a picture of a potted fern being watered) and she was so beautiful and Agatha felt the warmth bloom over her entire body just looking up at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ugh. Double Pathetic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat and looked away slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I came out a while ago, actually,” she said, jokingly, with a stupid little grin. “You missed it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “Shame,” she said. “But at least I’m here now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded in agreement before she could stop herself, clearing her throat. “Yeah,” she said. “Um, yeah, if you come to the gallery tomorrow, I can try to come out and say hello. Um, what time are you planning on coming in? I usually run early in the morning – as you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “I </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> know that,” she said. “Well, I was actually planning to visit my azaleas tomorrow morning again. They need to be watered, what with the lack of rain we’ve been having, you know? I’ll be there around eight. Then maybe I’ll get to the gallery at, say, ten?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to spend two hours sweet-talking your plants?” Agatha teased gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, it helps their growth,” Rio defended. “That’s scientifically-proven, by the way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure,” Agatha snorted. “Well, then maybe I’ll also see you on my run.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She certainly hoped so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Maybe,” she said, offering Agatha another grin. “Until then.” She bowed her head and began to hobble away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t wait,” Agatha said, a little bit louder than she intended. She watched Rio’s step falter just slightly, and her head turned just enough for Agatha to see the hint of a grin and the reddened tip of one heavily-pierced ear as she continued to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice followed after her a moment later, waving goodbye to Agatha with a </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> wide grin. When Agatha turned around, Jen Kale was in her personal bubble, practically vibrating with excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just scored a date with Lorna Wu’s daughter,” she whisper-screamed, bouncing on the balls of her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope that’s not the only reason you wanted a date with Alice,” Agatha said, backing up a step. “You better not be using her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not,” Jen huffed. “I </span>
<em>
<span>genuinely</span>
</em>
<span> like Alice. She’s funny and sweet and </span>
<em>
<span>super</span>
</em>
<span> hot. Also, like I said, I like them–” Agatha placed her hand over Jen’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do not say that disgusting thing again,” Agatha huffed. “I get it. You like her. Don’t fuck it up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen slapped Agatha’s hand off her mouth. “Why?” she said. “So I don’t mess things up for you and Rhea?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha corrected. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aha!” Jen said, pointing at her. “I </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t your parents ever teach you that it’s impolite to point at people,” Agatha grumbled, turning on her heel to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, Agatha!” Jen whined, following after her. “Tell me about her! She seems really cute and </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> hot. She’s funny, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that’s good,” Agatha retorted, “as I assume you’ve heard what she does for a living.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Jen said, finally matching pace with Agatha. “She invited me to see her show this weekend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That stopped Agatha right in her tracks. “She </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span>?” she asked, furrowing her brow. “</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yeeeesss</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen retorted, looking perturbed. “Why not? I like a good comedy act as much as the next person.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I just…I’m surprised, is all,” Agatha said, frowning to herself as she resumed her pace, shoving open the door to the community center and stepping out into the cool night air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What, are you upset because she didn’t invite </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>?” she asked. “She’s probably going to do it on your date tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> a date tomorrow,” Agatha huffed, reaching the car first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Girl, don’t lie,” Jen snorted. “Alice told me that Rio tried to visit you at work yesterday. Just like she told me she’s planning to do the same tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t reply to that, but maybe that was enough of a reply on its own. She reached the car and started tugging on the passenger side door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Girl, let go for a second, jeez,” Jen huffed. “I shouldn’t be complaining, though. I half-expected you to start running.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I might still do that,” Agatha huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t threaten me with a good time,” Jen chortled, finally unlocking the doors. “Okay, get in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tugged open the door and slid into the passenger seat, buckling herself in before crossing her arms over her chest like a petulant child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not a date,” she said as Jen started the car. “She’s just coming to the gallery to look at some paintings.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And to look at some </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen teased, pulling out of the parking spot and whipping through the lot to the exit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna just jump out,” Agatha said, unbuckling her seatbelt. “You don’t have to stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, quit it,” Jen huffed, locking the door. “I’m just teasing you. Honestly, I’d really like it if you came to the comedy show on Saturday with Alice and me, just as a kind of buffer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you need a buffer?” Agatha asked. “You already got the date. And it’s </span>
<em>
<span>super</span>
</em>
<span> obvious that Alice is into you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it?” Jen asked, airily. “I hadn’t noticed.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she was preening. Agatha could tell without even glancing at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still, though,” Jen said after a moment. “Come with me. Be my buffer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mean your cock block?” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you even dare,” Jen huffed. “Besides, as far as I’m aware there’s no cock for you to even block in this case. You’d be more like…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A third wheel?” Agatha suggested.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, technically a fourth. Possibly a fifth, if Rio’s sister is there, too. What do you know about her, by the way?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Agatha said. “Except she and Rio are seemingly close. We’ve barely had a single conversation where she hasn’t mentioned her. I still don’t even know her name, though. The way Rio talks about her is…sweet. She sounds like a cute kid. Though she’s probably older than me, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, Alice said she’s usually in the front row at Rio’s sets, filming her for TikTok and other socials. Rio has </span>
<em>
<span>quite</span>
</em>
<span> the following – a </span>
<em>
<span>lot</span>
</em>
<span> of young lesbian teens and twenty-somethings begging her to step on their throats.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jeez,” Agatha grimaced. “What the hell is </span>
<em>
<span>wrong</span>
</em>
<span> with today’s youth?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Girl, don’t play like you don’t like getting choked in bed,” Jen rebutted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God, I was, like, </span>
<em>
<span>twenty</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha huffed, flushing bright red. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And now you’re twenty-</span>
<em>
<span>nine</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen said. “Not that much time has passed and I’m almost certain not that much has changed, either. Has it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t dignify that with a response…if only because it was kind of true.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She caught Jen’s triumphant smile out of the corner of her eye and she rolled hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t mention to Rio that we slept together, okay?” she said after a long moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Jen asked. “Why would I do that, anyway? I’m trying to get into her friend’s pants.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just...last time we had a therapy session, I mentioned that you were my partner and I think Rio took it the wrong way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ew, like we were </span>
<em>
<span>romantic</span>
</em>
<span> partners? Barf!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, fuck off,” Agatha huffed. “You know I’m good in bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The ego on this one,” Jen said, shoving her shoulder. Agatha would have shoved her back if Jen weren’t driving and she didn’t value her life. “I wasn’t going to mention it,” Jen informed her, “and I still won’t. It’s a dark moment in my own history that I’d rather forget. I’m sure you would, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced sideways at Agatha, who had pressed her lips together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t you?” Jen prompted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “If we didn’t have that ‘dark moment’,” she said, “we wouldn’t have a successful gallery right now. I wouldn’t have a sister.” The last part was more grumbled under her breath than spoken aloud, but Jen still caught it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Awww, Aggie!” she practically squealed, reaching to tug Agatha against her side as she came to a stop at a red light. “Ya big softy!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh!” Agatha growled. “Let me go, freak!” Agatha said, shoving away from her and pressing herself against the door, glaring at Jen. “You never heard me say that. You will repeat it to nobody or I’ll tell Alice that you still wear a retainer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Jen snorted. “But just know that </span>
<em>
<span>I know</span>
</em>
<span> that you actually </span>
<em>
<span>like</span>
</em>
<span> having me around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I plead the Fifth,” Agatha muttered, looking out the window. “And I will still throw myself out of this moving car so you better shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So dramatic,” Jen murmured, but she was still grinning. “I love you, Ags,” she said quietly. Then, “as an annoying little sister, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m older than you,” Agatha shot back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I meant that literally, in terms of size,” Jen said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her lips together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Say it back,” Jen egged, reaching over to poke her in the cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha grumbled, swatting her hand away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come onnnn,” Jen said. “You know you want to. You know you feel it, too. Say it back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck off,” Agatha huffed, pressing even further against the car door, trying to evade Jen’s perfectly manicured fingers. Her arms were freakishly long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just say it!” Jen whined. “Come on! Don’t be such a baby!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I say it, will you promise to stop bugging me?” Agatha snapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Jen replied easily, batting her long lashes at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and grumbled something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, that doesn’t count!” Jen scoffed. “You have to say it clearly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ughhhh,” Agatha groaned. “</span>
<em>
<span>Fine</span>
</em>
<span>. Jen, I love you like an annoying, freakishly tall, bougie-as-fuck sister. Happy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen pressed her lips together for a long moment as she drove, then shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’ll do.”</span>

<b>Chapter Seven</b>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s bedroom faced east.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Most mornings, she </span>
<em>
<span>despised</span>
</em>
<span> this fact, but Dulce had won the west-facing bedroom fair and square – via an intense game of Connect Four that ended with Rio lying facedown on the kitchen floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On mornings when she had to – or rather, </span>
<em>
<span>wanted to</span>
</em>
<span> – be up early, she was thankful for the rising sun peeking through her crappy blackout curtains. The bright light woke her up much better than any alarm ever could. The sunbeams hit her right in the face the </span>
<em>
<span>second</span>
</em>
<span> day broke, so she was up and usually unable to go back to sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On any other morning, that would have been entirely unwelcome.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This</span>
</em>
<span> morning, however, that would have been perfect. The sun was meant to rise at a quarter to seven, giving her more than an hour to get ready to see Ag–ahem, her azaleas. Yes, her precious, </span>
<em>
<span>beautiful</span>
</em>
<span> azaleas that she had been taking care of for </span>
<em>
<span>years</span>
</em>
<span> and would hopefully continue to take care of well into her old age. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watered them every three days if there was no rain to do it for her. And they’d been without rain for at least a week now, so Rio was certain that–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio growled when her alarm woke her up that morning instead of the rising sun. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was seven AM. There was </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span> sun peeking through her curtains. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt an anxious churning in her stomach as she pushed herself out of bed and hobbled the couple of feet to her window on the opposite wall. She tugged open the curtains and groaned aloud when she saw the steady downpour of rain hitting the street below.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Punctuated by lightning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you,” Rio grumbled at the faraway strike of lightning. Thunder answered her and she flipped it off – as well as one could flip off thunder, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fucking Thor.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a loud groan as she hobbled back to her bed and flopped down facefirst, groaning obscenely loud into her comforter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a knock on her door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Dulce asked, sounding far too awake for seven in the morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grumbled something unintelligible (even to herself) into her mattress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, I’m coming in,” Dulce said, seconds before the door opened. “What’s wrong?” she asked, eyeing Rio kneeling on the ground with her face on the blankets, hair a wild mess around her head, shoulders limp with defeat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Swan and Reaper slinked into the bedroom, the latter immediately jumping onto the bed and stretching herself over Rio’s pillows while the former preferred to loaf her plump body onto Rio’s calves and immediately fall back asleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, unable to stand up due to Swan’s asshole behavior, turned her head in Dulce’s direction. “I was supposed to go to the park today,” she said, in a pitiful tone, “to water my azaleas.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce glanced toward the window. “It’s raining,” she pointed out, unhelpfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Baby Einstein,” Rio grumbled. “I see that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So Mother Nature took care of the watering for you,” Dulce said, raising one brow. “Why are you upset?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I </span>
<em>
<span>wanted</span>
</em>
<span> to go to the park,” Rio whined like a child. “I was going to be productive today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can still be productive,” Dulce pointed out. “Just go for a walk in the rain. Wear your poncho and your grippy shoes, though. I swear to God, Rio, if I get a call from the ER again…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was </span>
<em>
<span>one time</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio grumbled, “and I </span>
<em>
<span>told</span>
</em>
<span> that lady I didn’t need an ambulance. I didn’t even have a scrape!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“People see the cane and lose all brain cells,” Dulce sighed, padding over to sit next to Rio on the floor. She reached for Swan, ignoring her disgruntled mews as she pulled her into her lap and started cooing at her, placating her with scritches under her chin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a thankful smile as she turned her body so that she could sit cross-legged on the floor. She laid her head down on Dulce’s shoulder. Dulce mirrored her position, the two of them petting Swan, who was purring contentedly across their laps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not to be left out, Reaper slinked over to them and draped herself over their heads in a way that could definitely not be ignored. Rio snorted, shaking her head as she reached up to scratch the cat on her head. Reaper chirped happily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So why are you </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> upset?” Dulce asked after a long moment of just enjoying the purring of their two fur babies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Rio hummed, avoiding her gaze as she took Reaper into her arms, holding her like a baby in her arms as she scratched her belly. Reaper nipped at her fingers playfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t pretend you didn’t hear me,” Dulce huffed. “Why are you actually upset that you can’t go to the park? Just because you can’t water your plants? Or is it something </span>
<em>
<span>else</span>
</em>
<span>?” Dulce squinted her eyes at Rio, searching her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, for her part, tried very hard not to blink or look away or lose the unaffected facade she was desperately trying to put on under her baby sister’s scrutinizing gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But nobody wins a blinking contest with Dulce Vidal. </span>
<em>
<span>Nobody.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus!” Rio huffed. “Don’t your eyes ever dry out?” She blinked several times in succession and rubbed at her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope!” Dulce said, chipperly. “Now spill: who is she?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio snorted. “Who is whom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t try to dazzle me with your correct use of whom,” Dulce said, now pointing in Rio’s face. “What. Is. Her. Name?” She poked her nose to punctuate each word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know who you’re talking about,” Rio said, swatting her hands away and trying to play dumb as she slung Reaper’s body on her shoulder and pushed herself to her feet. She sat down on her bed as she continued to stroke the lanky cat’s back. Reaper trilled, stretching her legs a little bit as she relaxed more into Rio’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Riri,” Dulce groaned, standing up with the heavy block of Swan’s weight in her arms, “come oooon. It’s </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>. Your sister. Sisters don’t keep secrets from each other.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like your high school boyfriend who was </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> too old for you?” Rio shot back. “What was his name…Johnny?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce’s face blanched. “You know about Johnny?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I caught the idiot trying to sneak in during your senior year,” Rio said. “You know, when you were fourteen and </span>
<em>
<span>he </span>
</em>
<span>was seventeen? He tried selling me your AP Calc textbook. The one where your name was clearly written on it on a piece of packing tape on the back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fucking dumbass,” Dulce muttered. “That only lasted, like, three weeks,” she admitted. “And nothing happened other than kissing, I swear. I was tutoring him in math and…God, he was </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> dumb, but kinda hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gross.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever, lesbian,” Dulce huffed. “Not the point. Stop deflecting. Just tell me who she is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, stroking Reaper’s fur as the cat lounged on her shoulder and made biscuits with her back fat. “Just this woman who runs in the park sometimes,” she said, offering a half-truth. She didn’t want to reveal too much just yet. She still didn’t know how Agatha might feel about people knowing her diagnosis so soon. Rio knew that Dulce would never tell anybody, of course, but still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce would also give her so much shit for not telling her a) that she </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> met an attractive newcomer to the therapy group and b) that said woman was her favorite artist and gallery owner, Agatha freaking Harkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t want to deal with that just yet, though logically she knew it was coming sooner or later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And have you </span>
<em>
<span>spoken</span>
</em>
<span> to this woman?” Dulce asked, rocking Swan in her arms like a big fat baby. “Or do you just watch her like a creep from behind your azalea bush?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of </span>
<em>
<span>course</span>
</em>
<span> I’ve spoken to her,” Rio huffed. “Quite a few times, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really? What’s her name? What is she like?” Dulce jumped up, getting a startled mrow from Swan as she bounced onto the bed next to Rio, looking down at her with excited brown eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s…funny,” Rio said. “She likes my punny shirts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down at the shirt that she’d worn yesterday, which she didn’t bother to take off before bed. Agatha had snorted at it and Rio felt like the funniest motherfucker in the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, wow,” Dulce said. “You better not let her slip through your fingers. That’s a rare one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck off, my shirts are hilarious,” Rio snorted, shoving her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gentle,” Dulce said, when Swan let out a pitiful meow in protest of the rough movement, “I am with child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “Anyway,” she said, “enough about me and my pathetic crush. Why are </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> up and dressed so early? Early shift?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bold of you to assume I ever went to bed last night,” Dulce said, letting out a yawn. One that Swan echoed. “I was up last night editing my last batch of photos for Sharon’s group.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, how are they coming?” Rio asked. “Any with me in them? You can earn big money with </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> beautiful face, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, you can’t even tell it’s </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> in the shot I sold,” Dulce reminded her. “And no, they’re mostly city shots from the tops of buildings around Westview.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How the hell did you gain roof access to buildings around Westview?” Rio asked, raising one brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Best I not tell you,” Dulce said, stroking Swan like Dr. Evil. “Give you some plausible deniability in case the cops ever come calling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They better not,” Rio said, dryly. “I didn’t bust my ass for you to become some </span>
<em>
<span>Orange is the New Black</span>
</em>
<span> extra.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce scoffed. “They can’t prove anything,” she said, standing up and walking, with Swan in her arms, to the door. “Also, you </span>
<em>
<span>know </span>
</em>
<span>I would be a main character, one with a tragic backstory.” </span>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span> was the truth. “Anyway, I’m gonna go pass out for a few hours until my shift starts. Let me know if you need something, but also please don’t need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have work today?” Rio asked, removing Reaper from her shoulder, much to the cat’s chagrin. “After staying up all night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I work in a coffee shop, Rio,” Dulce retorted. “I’m sure I’ll manage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and rolled her eyes, plopping Reaper back onto her pillow and getting up to change for her walk to the park. Maybe, if she were lucky, Agatha would still show up for her jog.</span>
</p><p>
<span>People jogged in the rain, right?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span>, in fact, show up on her run. Rio was sitting on her bench in a lime green rain poncho with a hood, sipping green tea from Dulce’s cafe. It had already gone mostly cold by the time Agatha finally came around the bend, but Rio didn’t mind. Her heart flipped when she saw Agatha in a purple windbreaker with the hood pulled up over her hair and a tiny backpack on her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fancy seeing you here,” she said, jogging in place as she stopped in front of Rio. “Figured you’d let Mother Nature handle the watering for the day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was that an artist thing? Invoking the name of Mother Nature? It was cute, but creepy how similar she and Dulce were. Rio didn’t want to think about it. She was trying not to shudder as it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, she can sprinkle a little rain,” Rio huffed, “but can she tell them how pretty they look and how proud she is of them?” Her voice devolved into a cartoonish baby voice as she turned to her azalea bush, stroking their petals, which were soft with raindrops. The bush itself was thriving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope somebody loves me as much as you love that singular azalea bush,” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio turned back to her with wide eyes, she was blushing and her lips were pressed tightly together like she hadn’t meant to say that aloud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think </span>
<em>
<span>anybody</span>
</em>
<span> will ever love anything the way I love Iggy,” Rio said. “She’s my baby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Iggy?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s what I named the bush,” Rio replied, keeping a straight face. That was not exactly a lie. Dulce had actually named the bush. But it was so clever, Rio perpetually took credit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What Dulce didn’t know couldn’t hurt her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted under her breath. “Of course you name your plants,” she said, almost inaudibly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t keep anything alive long enough to name it,” Agatha admitted. “I’m much better with inanimate objects, but I’m not about to name my toaster, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A toaster’s name would obviously be Toasty,” Rio said, without an ounce of humor evident on her face. It was a Herculean effort, truly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that what you named </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> toaster?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nah, mine is named Kevin.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That got a startled laugh from Agatha’s lips, but a laugh nonetheless. Score one for Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why Kevin?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s red,” Rio said, shrugging. “Kinda reminded me of Kevin Bacon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t try to understand my strange, lesion-riddled brain,” Rio said. “Even before the lesions, I was a pretty weird kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t surprise me, actually,” Agatha said. “I’m betting you were the class clown?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was a jock, actually,” Rio said, noting the look of surprise on Agatha’s face. “I played basketball all throughout high school and college </span>
<em>
<span>while</span>
</em>
<span> raising my little sister and working a part-time job at the local ice cream parlor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoa,” Agatha said, her jogging in place slowing to a stop. “That sounds…rough. When did you sleep?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I blinked a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out another snort at that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Score two for Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really, it was tough, but I got through it. My sister is practically a baby genius, anyway, so it wasn’t tough. Also, she was a </span>
<em>
<span>total</span>
</em>
<span> chick magnet. Girls used to tell me how </span>
<em>
<span>cute</span>
</em>
<span> she was and how much we looked alike.” She preened a little bit, then her shoulders slumped. “They only ever bought </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> milkshakes though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aww,” Agatha laughed. “That must have been </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> hard for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was, yes, thank you,” Rio said. “At least she shared them with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aww, that’s nice,” Agatha said. “Your sister sounds like a lot of fun. Is she single?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s straight,” Rio said, probably too quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She actually didn’t know Dulce’s sexuality </span>
<em>
<span>explicitly</span>
</em>
<span>. She knew that she had dated one singular guy when she was </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> too young to have dated anybody, let alone somebody three years older than her when she was practically still pre-pubescent. If she ever saw that slimy Walker kid’s face again, he was going to quickly become fertilizer for her next azalea bush.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t know about anybody Dulce might have </span>
<em>
<span>connected with</span>
</em>
<span> in college, though. She’d always figured that Dulce was still too young for your average-aged college student, anyway. Rio had worried about her, of course, but Dulce was back every single weekend and school break, without fail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wondered if Dulce would even bother with the Pride celebrations they went to every June if it weren’t for the presence of her lesbian older sister.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Darn,” Agatha said, snapping her fingers. “Well there goes </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> idea.” Her smile was teasing, though, and a little bit knowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Score one for Agatha, Rio thought to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Rio said, desperate to change the subject, “how was your run?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha definitely noticed the change, but she didn’t comment on it as she looked at her watch again. “It’s not over quite yet,” she said. “I still have another half-mile to go before I reach my goal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s your goal?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Five miles,” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a low whistle. “That seems like a lot,” she said. “Does this town even </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> five miles to run or do you have to make a loop around Eastview, as well?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Half a point more for Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I run the paths in the park,” she said. “There’s enough of them for me to usually reach my goal. And I’m not opposed to repeating paths.” She shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where do you get the energy?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am fueled by spite, typically,” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Damn. One more point for Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was catching up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, do you have room for some coffee, too?” Rio asked. She held up her cup. “This went cold a while ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long have you been sitting here?” Agatha asked, concern etched in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since eight,” Rio said, shrugging. “Not that long. It’s only…” she looked at her phone screen, “9:07. Huh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me finish this last half-mile,” Agatha said, with a lopsided smirk, “and I’ll buy you something hot at the cafe next-door to my gallery.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds like a d–deal,” Rio stuttered, catching herself just in time. “I’ll be right here, cradling my ice cold tea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be quick,” Agatha said before racing off. Rio watched her go, trying to keep her gaze respectful – and failing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are the chances that I fuck this up before it even begins?” Rio asked the azalea bush. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The silent response felt judgemental.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To her credit, running the last half-mile around the park took less than five minutes, and Agatha didn’t even look sweaty when she landed back in front of Rio, still energized as she ran in place. Rio’s eyes shone with amusement as she pushed herself up from the bench and followed the runner down the trail and out of the park, her poncho brushing Agatha’s windbreaker, but not other parts of their bodies brushing – which actually did take some effort considering how much she </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> wanted to reach for Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tossed the remnants of her tea into a trash can on the corner just before they reached the cafe nestled right between a hardware store and Agatha’s gallery on the opposite corner. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The cafe was called </span>
<em>
<span>Witch’s Brew</span>
</em>
<span>. Rio and Dulce had gone there nearly every time they visited the gallery together. Hell, she’d gone there just the other day when she attempted to see Agatha at the gallery. They knew her name by now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, Miss Rio,” the girl at the front, whose name tag read </span>
<em>
<span>Kamala</span>
</em>
<span>, greeted with a wide grin. “You’re here earlier than usual!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a regular?” Agatha asked, a bit of a teasing lilt in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My sister and I come through on occasion,” Rio replied, blushing slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And good morning to you, too, Miss Agatha,” Kamala added. “Can I get you each your regular? Earl Grey, sweetened, with a pan au chocolat,” she pointed to Rio, “and an oat milk latte with two pumps of vanilla and a butter croissant, right?” She was looking at Agatha now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, thank you, sweetheart,” Agatha said, unzipping the pocket of her windbreaker.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio beat her to it, however, pulling out her phone and pressing it to the POS, grinning in triumph when Agatha frowned at her, her credit card held uselessly in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she huffed, “I was gonna pay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can pay next time,” Rio said, her ears burning when she realized the implication of what she’d said. Agatha’s pleased smile kept her from clarifying, however, and she just let the words hang in the air as Kamala printed out her receipt and handed it over before she got started on making their drinks and warming their pastries. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You get us a table,” Agatha told Rio. “I’ll get the food.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m perfectly capable of carrying food, Agatha,” Rio huffed, “even with my limp.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You paid,” Agatha pointed out. “Let me at least do </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> and carry them to the table.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio narrowed her eyes for a moment, trying to discern if Agatha was being genuine. It so often happened that people thought Rio incapable or even </span>
<em>
<span>weak</span>
</em>
<span> because of her cane that it was hard to tell if, right in this very moment, Agatha was being genuine and nonjudgmental of her disability. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had one eyebrow raised in challenge, her arms crossed over her chest, no sympathy in her eyes. Rio decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she said, turning toward the tables. “Wow, it is so crowded in here,” she deadpanned, looking at the nearly empty cafe, “how ever will I find us a good place to sit?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure you’ll manage,” Agatha chuckled as she walked to the end of the bar where Kamala had already set the first pastry bag and a steaming cup of tea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hobbled over to a four-top booth by the wide cafe window, slipping her slick poncho off and turning it inside out as she hung it on one of the hooks on the pillar next to the booth, then slipping into a seat, placing her cane next to her. She looked outside, where rain still fell – albeit a little more gently – and people strolled by with their own ponchos and trench coats and umbrellas, scurrying to work and wherever else somebody might go on a rainy Friday morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Usually, on a Friday morning, she’d be working on new material for her performance at </span>
<em>
<span>The Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span> that night. At this time, however, she’d more likely be sleeping, dead to the world until she dragged herself out of bed at noon to give herself and her cats something to eat for lunch before setting up her laptop at the kitchen table for the rest of the afternoon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha placed down her steaming tea and warmed chocolate croissant, however, Rio decided that she’d much rather be here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slid into the booth across from her and slipped off the windbreaker, balling the jacket up and dumping it unceremoniously onto the seat next to her with her backpack before undoing her ponytail and running her fingers through her curly long hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio malfunctioned at that exact moment, watching Agatha’s lithe fingers tangle in the dark brown locks, combing out knots and doing their best to fix the shape that the ponytail had locked her hair in for who knows how long. Rio’s own fingers twitched around her cup and she used them to bring the tea to her lips for a sip instead of doing what she wanted to do (reach out to run her own fingers through Agatha’s hair) instead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha said, after finally fixing her hair so that most of the tangles were out and it hung over one shoulder, “tell me about your sister.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My sister?” Rio asked, tilting her head. “What about her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, her cheeks turning pink as she took another sip of her coffee. “Honestly,” she said, “I have no idea. You’ve mentioned her a few times and I really didn’t know how else to break the ice.” She looked down at her pastry bag, pulling out her warmed croissant. It was steaming slightly. Agatha tore a small piece off and popped it into her mouth with a pleased hum, licking some crumbs off of her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat went dry at the sight, her cheeks warming. She took a sip of her own drink and cleared her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um, she’s good,” she said. “She’s…she’s a super genius, honestly. She was accelerated through school when she was little and ended up graduating college at eighteen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened at that. “Seriously?” she asked. “Whoa.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, somewhat proudly. “Yeah, she’s…kind of incredible. Still a snarky little shit, though. She gets that from me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your parents must be proud,” Agatha commented, taking another bite of the croissant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried not to let her face fall at the mention of her parents. It’s not like Agatha knew about the difficult relationship they had, the therapy that she’d put Dulce and herself through to get over abandonment issues that neither of them were even aware that they’d had the first year after they moved out of their house. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They hadn’t even heard from their parents for a few years now, not since Dulce graduated from undergrad at eighteen and they were let off the hook for child support.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was never really your mother,” Magda Vidal had told Dulce at the dinner she and their father had treated them to after her ceremony. “I gave birth to you, but Rio was the one who raised you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t have to be,” Rio had pointed out, not at all bitter about it. She squeezed Dulce’s hand under the table to reassure her. “I could have just been her sister if you let me be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You already know that we never wanted children,” their father, Luis, said. It was said as a matter of fact, no emotion. “We were too young the first time, with Rio, and then we were overexcited and underprepared the second time, with Dulcita.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t call me that,” Dulce said. “That’s not my name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luis’s eyes widened in surprise, but he nodded. “</span>
<em>
<span>Lo siento</span>
</em>
<span>,” he said. “We were never the parents you deserved,” he admitted. “We should have been. But we just…we couldn’t. Now, it’s too late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw clenched. She didn’t agree with that at all. She was thirty years old and she had already raised a child from infancy to legal adulthood, but in some ways she felt as though they still both needed their parents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she wasn’t about to beg for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she just nodded, thanked them for paying for the meal, and waved to their car after it pulled away from the curb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was five years ago. They never even got Happy Birthday texts after that. So they never sent them, either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Who needed them?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio must have been quiet for too long, lost in thought, because she noticed Agatha’s smile starting to drop as her eyebrows knotted together. She opened her mouth to say something else, but Rio beat her to it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re not really around anymore,” Rio admitted, trying to stay as vague as possible while remaining casual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha said. She cleared her throat. “Sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be,” Rio insisted. “It’s fine. We never really needed them, anyway. I raised Dulce all by myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dulce?” Agatha echoed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My sister,” Rio explained. “She was named after my mother’s pregnancy cravings. A lot of chocolate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at that, but there was something else in her eyes – something like recognition. “Is that a Vidal trait?” she asked. “A love of chocolate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s in our blood,” Rio said, taking a bite of her croissant. “Probably from our deep Puerto Rican roots.” She licked a little bit of chocolate she could feel from her lips and watched, in poorly-disguised satisfaction, at the way Agatha’s eyes tracked the movement. “Chocolate has always been big in Latin America, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah…” Agatha said, looking </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> distracted still as Rio wiped some chocolate from the corner of her mouth with her thumb and then stuck her thumb into her mouth, fighting for her life not to smile as those blue eyes seemed to darken slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she had any doubt before that Agatha Harkness was into her, it was gone now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just didn’t know how to go about officially asking her out on a date…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she continued to talk about the history of chocolate, how the Spaniards had actually brought it over during their colonization in the late 16th or early 17th centuries. She was basically just echoing a lot of facts she’d learned for a grad school paper about the cacao plant, but she found it interesting how it was loosely tied to her roots. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What we know as modern chocolate originated with the Aztecs,” she said, tearing apart her croissant, “but it was actually the Olmecs who started using cacao in a traditional bitter drink. Aztecs gave chocolate its name, derived from the Aztec word </span>
<em>
<span>xocoatl.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Agatha said, her cheeks flushed for some odd reason, “you sure know a </span>
<em>
<span>lot</span>
</em>
<span> about the history of chocolate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m very passionate about sweet things,” Rio replied, popping another piece of her croissant into her mouth and making sure she shared </span>
<em>
<span>intense</span>
</em>
<span> eye contact with Agatha, trying to convey something she couldn’t yet say with words. That blush on Agatha’s cheeks deepened, and she was the first to break eye contact as she took another sip of her latte, clearing her throat. Rio chuckled under her breath as she sipped her tea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sipped and snacked for a long moment before Rio cleared her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she said, “do you have any siblings? Besides Jen, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted and shook her head. “Only child,” she said, “thankfully.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aw, you don’t want somebody who steals your most comfy clothes or throws fake spiders at you?” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want somebody to have the same trauma as me,” Agatha said before gasping and placing her hand over her mouth and looking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her lips together and took a deep breath, nodding. “That’s fair,” she said. “I wish I could have protected Dulce against that better.” She tapped her fingers on her cup. “Were they terrible?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>She</span>
</em>
<span> was, yes,” Agatha admitted. “But my grandmother took me away to live with her when I was still little. And she was…” Agatha gave Rio a small, serene smile, “the best.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you tell me about her?” Rio asked. At the curious look Agatha gave her, Rio shrugged. “My mom’s parents disowned her for having a baby out of wedlock. My dad’s mom died when I was a toddler, and he never knew his dad. I didn’t grow up with grandparents, and, at twelve, I more or less became a parent myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and nodded. “Her name was Isla,” she said. “She was my favorite person in the world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio listened with rapt attention as Agatha told her about her grandmother, laughing and tearing up a little (but never fully allowing herself to cry at the same time) as she told little anecdotes of her childhood growing up under her gran’s care, how her grandmother supported her with her art and anything else she put her mind to, how she had passed before Agatha finished college. Rio reached out, initiating physical contact between them for the first time, placing her hand over Agatha’s in the center of the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha thankfully didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time their pastries were gone and the last dregs of their hot drinks had gone cold, the rain had stopped pouring outside and Kamala was standing awkwardly at the side of their table with a sheepish smile on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, ladies,” she said, “I’m so sorry to have to do this, but my manager says that there’s a one-hour time limit to sit here and you two passed that about fifteen minutes ago. He’s getting antsy.” She glanced behind her to where a graying old man stood behind the counter with a sourpuss expression. Kamala gave them an apologetic smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her phone. It was almost eleven.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fine, sweetie,” Agatha said with a laugh. “We should actually get going, anyway.” She pulled her hand away from Rio’s and reached instead for her jacket and backpack. </span>
</p><p>
<span>While Rio mourned the loss of her hand, she did follow Agatha in preparing to leave, swiping the crumbs from the table into the pastry bag and then tossing that bag and her empty cup into a nearby trash can. She offered Kamala a soft smile as she slipped back into her now-dry poncho, leaving the hood down as she waited for Agatha to zip up her windbreaker and put her backpack back on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they were ready to go, Agatha motioned for Rio to follow her but unfortunately didn’t reach for her hand again, much to Rio’s disappointment. Still, Rio followed her (at this point, she thought, she might follow Agatha into an active volcano.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a short walk to the front door of the gallery, where people were already milling about, looking at the art on the walls behind the large reception desk. There was a college-aged girl at the front, selling tickets and answering a phone. When she saw Agatha, she gave her a wide grin and a big wave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi, Miss Harkness!” she called out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello, America,” Agatha replied, smiling back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She led Rio toward one of a set of doors to the left of the entrance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is my office,” she said. “Just give me a moment to get changed.” She motioned toward the ensuite bathroom. “I mean, you can obviously go and start looking around. I’ll catch up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can wait,” Rio said, sitting down on a sofa that was against the wall adjacent to the door. “I need to sit for a minute, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be quick,” Agatha promised, heading toward the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take your time,” Rio said, settling against one of the pillows on the couch. It was ridiculously comfy. She could probably fall asleep here. She wondered if Agatha had ever taken a cat nap in the middle of a work day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Agatha laughed. “Be right back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shut the bathroom door with a decisive </span>
<em>
<span>click</span>
</em>
<span> and Rio leaned back, her gaze roaming around the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The room itself was decently-sized, with a desk, some bookshelves, the couch she was sitting on, a deep purple area rug, and a few pieces of art on the walls. Good art, of course. Paintings that obviously took some skill to make. Rio wondered for a moment if Agatha had made them, but then she saw the tiny paper plaques next to them, labeling them as the work of other artists. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One was a piece by Jen Kale, a piece of a beach house with a bright blue sky and a pier in the distance. It looked so real that Rio could almost feel the sea air, could almost hear the waves against the shore, smell the ocean…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Damn, Jen actually seemed to have talent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Good thing she was just Agatha’s sister, huh?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s embarrassed to say that she was relieved to learn that Agatha’s ‘partner’ wasn’t in the romantic sense. She felt as though Agatha had been trying to hint at that, in retrospect, but Rio had been entirely clueless about it until she made it clear by taking Jen Kale with her to their group the previous night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now said sister was about to go on a date with Rio’s best friend.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was like a frickin’ romantic comedy. With lesbians.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(Which, in Rio’s humble opinion, was how all rom-coms should be.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wandered around the room, looking at the art, her eyes roaming over every inch until she caught something along the top edge of the wall. Her eyes inched upward and her jaw dropped the second she saw the stars.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha emerged from the bathroom, Rio was lying in the middle of her office floor, staring up at the ceiling, her cane clutched in her hand at her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh…whatcha doin’ there?” Agatha asked, padding to the other woman to loom over her, her hair in two long, loose braids falling over her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned up at her, somewhat sheepishly. She looked pretty like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, I was looking at the stars?” she offered. “This is the easiest way to see everything.” She motioned to the ceiling, where an entire solar system, complete with realistic constellations, nebulas, and planets had been painted on the ceiling, centered around the round globe light, which was acting as the Sun. It must have taken </span>
<em>
<span>ages</span>
</em>
<span> to paint all of that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned down at her and held up one finger, walking over to the door. There was a singular window on it so that one could see into the office. Rio watched, upside down, as Agatha pulled down the tiny shade on the door, then pressed the sides to some velcro strips on the sides and bottom, removing any light leakage from outside the office, then reached for the light switch right next to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked into the sudden darkness, her eyes returning to the ceiling as her jaw fell open. The painted stars and galaxies above her head began to glow in a rainbow of iridescent color. The planets had dark backgrounds with their textures painted on them in glowing lines. The nebulas were like shimmering clouds. The stars stood out the most, painting the familiar constellations all over the ceiling and spilling onto the top few inches of the walls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoa…” Rio said, her eyes taking in everything with new appreciation. “This is…wow. Did you do this all yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said, walking over to plop herself onto the floor next to Rio, lying down a couple inches away. Their fingers brushed momentarily before she settled and Rio felt her cheeks go hot. “I had help,” Agatha continued. “Jen painted most of the planets, using some kind of map for ‘the best alignment’ so I didn’t perpetually have my Mercury in retrograde or whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That would require an actual mobile Mercury,” Rio pointed out. “Retrograde just means that it appears to be moving away from the Earth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever, nerd,” Agatha teased. “She said something like that. I just let her do whatever she wanted with them. A few of the planets are painted with her own customized paints. I did the glow lines over them, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They look really cool,” Rio said. “Are you into astronomy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Astrology, actually,” Agatha said. “Gran was half-Greek. Her Yia-Yia used to tell her all the Greek myths from this big book at bedtime. She, in turn, told them to my dad, who was just starting to tell them to me when he passed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile fell and she found herself immediately reaching for Agatha’s hand. She hadn’t said anything about her dad when they were sitting at the cafe earlier. For some reason, she had just assumed that </span>
<em>
<span>Gran</span>
</em>
<span> was Agatha’s mother’s mom, though how somebody so sweet could have raised anybody that cruel was beyond her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, at least, it made sense.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m okay,” Agatha said, still allowing Rio to squeeze her hand. “I was two, he didn’t live with us, and I honestly don’t have many memories of him. Most of what I know was told to me by my gran, and she’s </span>
<em>
<span>incredibly</span>
</em>
<span> biased.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still,” Rio murmured, “it must be tough. Was he nice, at least?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“From what gran told me and from what I remember? Yeah,” Agatha said. Rio could hear the strain in her voice. “He was nice. He used to bring me to my gran’s for breakfast, and he </span>
<em>
<span>insisted</span>

<span> on cutting up my strawberries himself.” Agatha smiled softly. “He fashioned the pieces into pictures for me. Gran said that’s where I get my artistic talent – cut-up strawberries.” She laughed and Rio joined her. “My only memory of him is sitting on his shoulders while we walk through the zoo. I don’t even remember which zoo we were at, but there were elephants. And there was a giraffe that stooped over the fence to look me right in the eye. I got to feed it something. He bought me a stuffed one, I think, but I have no idea where it is now. Mother probably tossed it as soon as I got home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fucking bitch,” Rio grumbled, tightening her hold on Agatha’s hand. “Full offense to her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deserved,” Agatha laughed. “I go to his grave on Father’s Day. I bring azaleas because those were gran’s favorite flowers, and I figure they might have also been his.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s his name?” Rio asked, her voice barely above a whisper as they continued to look up at the ceiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas,” Agatha whispered back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good name,” Rio murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to name my son that,” Agatha said. “You know, if I ever have one.” Rio glanced toward her to see a blush appear on her cheeks in the low glow of the painted stars above. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could see Agatha as a mother, with a little boy with her blue eyes and curly brown hair and big smile and beautiful nose…and a little gap between his teeth, maybe…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That’s not how that works, dumbass</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snapped her eyes back to the ceiling, swallowing thickly as she continued to scan the painted night sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’d make a good mom,” she said, after a long moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled at that. “You barely know me,” she said. “I could be a shitty mom. I could continue the cycle of abuse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You wouldn’t,” Rio said, with certainty. “Not after what your mother did to you. Besides, you got out of there. The woman who </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> raised you sounds pretty cool. You could follow </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> example.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt Agatha’s breath hit her cheek and turned her head to face the other woman, finding Agatha’s bright blue eyes staring back at her. Suddenly, her mouth was very dry and she was fighting for her life not to let her gaze flicker down to Agatha’s lips, which were full and plump and dammit she was looking, wasn’t she?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seemed to be having a similar problem keeping her gaze above Rio’s nose-level.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely,” Rio said, a little too delayed. She swallowed. “You would be a great mother, Agatha Harkness. There’s no doubt in my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t say anything to that. She just nibbled at her bottom lip. Her gaze flickered back down to Rio’s lips, and Rio’s breath stuttered in her lungs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without fully making the decision to, Rio found herself leaning toward Agatha. To her surprise and delight, Agatha was also moving toward her, their hands still clutching each other, fingers slotted together as their noses brushed and–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why is the light off?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sprang away from her, tearing her hand from Rio’s so quickly that her fingers ached. She jumped to her feet as the lights came on above their heads, spinning around to face Jen Kale, who had entered the office without so much as a </span>
<em>
<span>knock</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was back to disliking the other woman. At least this time she had both met her and found a legitimate reason to feel this way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio attempted to get up as quickly, but her lower leg was on pins and needles and her cane would just not cooperate, so it ended up with her turtling on the floor for about a minute while the other two women watched, staring down at her blankly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” Rio said, “you </span>
<em>
<span>could</span>
</em>
<span> help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Agatha said, reaching down to hook her arm around Rio’s, giving her the support she needed to get to her feet, planting her cane firmly on the ground to help her stay upright. “You okay?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’m fi-ine,” Rio said, her breath stuttering when she turned her head to find that she and Agatha were back in their previous position, noses brushing as they stared into each other’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen cleared her throat after about five seconds of this, and Rio found her </span>
<em>
<span>dislike</span>
</em>
<span> quickly turning to actual </span>
<em>
<span>hatred</span>
</em>
<span> of the other woman as Agatha stepped away with a pathetic little </span>
<em>
<span>pat-pat</span>
</em>
<span> on Rio’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she turned to Jen with an annoyed expression (good).</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you forgotten how to knock, Jennifer?” she asked, an edge to her tone as she crossed her arms and cocked her hip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> forgotten that we had a meeting scheduled in my office about fifteen minutes ago?” Jen Kale retorted. “You’re lucky I gave you a grace period, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What meeting?” Agatha huffed, slipping her phone out of her pocket and swiping through it. She let out a groan. “Ugh, I completely forgot.” Agatha offered Rio an apologetic smile. “I’m so sorry about this,” she said, “but, </span>
<em>
<span>unfortunately</span>
</em>
<span>, my annoying co-worker–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Business partner</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen corrected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“- is correct. We have a meeting.” She glared at Jen, who was smiling triumphantly. “I hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You love me,” Jen snorted. She looked at Rio. “It’s nice to see you again, Rio,” she said. “I’m sorry for interrupting, but I honestly expected Agatha to be in the office like an hour ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to play it casual, like Agatha’s pseudo-sister/business partner/resident annoyance </span>
<em>
<span>didn’t</span>
</em>
<span> just interrupt what might have been…</span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No worries,” Rio said, shrugging. Chill, casual, not blue-balled (lipped?) at all. “Work comes first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um,” Agatha said, “it should only take about twenty minutes, if you wanna wait for me. In the gallery, of course. You shouldn’t be cooped up in my office that entire time. I can come meet you afterward,” she cleared her throat, “if you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Agatha Harkness was shy, her entire face red and a little bit of sweat on her brow as she stuck her hands into the pockets of a pair of extremely well-fitted indigo trousers. And Rio was fucking </span>
<em>
<span>charmed</span>
</em>
<span> by it. Damn her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” she said. “Text me when you’re done and I’ll let you know where I’m at.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha said, chuckling a little, “I would need your phone number to do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Rio said, feeling her own cheeks warm up. “Um…may I?” She pointed to Agatha’s phone. Agatha nodded, swiping on it a few times before handing it over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio entered her number and then took a second longer than necessary to come up with a name for herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She settled on “Rio💀🌺”, sent herself “wazzuuuuup?” and handed the phone back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha saw what she’d done, she snorted under her breath. “You’re such a geek,” she teased, slipping her phone back in her pocket. “I’ll text you in a bit. Let me walk you over to America so she can give you a wristband.” She looked at Jen. “Go to your office. I’ll be right there,” she promised, waving Jen away with her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt some stupid satisfaction at that as she followed Agatha out to the reception desk, where they immediately skipped the line.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few people complained, but Agatha ignored them, flashing an ID badge, with the word “Owner” written clearly in big block letters, she’d pulled from her pocket, still not even glancing at them as she smiled at the girl behind the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello, America, dear,” she said, her voice honey-sweet. “Can you get my friend, Miss Vidal here,” she placed her hand on Rio’s shoulder, which sent shivers down her gay little spine, “a wristband?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, Miss Harkness,” the girl, America, said, reaching under the counter and pulling out a wristband. Rio stuck out her left wrist, and the girl wrapped the band around her wrist, keeping it just loose enough so that it wouldn’t be uncomfortable, but tight enough that it wouldn’t slip off as she walked around. “When you’re done,” the girl said, “please discard your wristband in the recycling vestibule next to the entrance so that it doesn’t end up in a landfill somewhere. You can do your part to save the planet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Naturally,” Rio agreed with a nod and a smirk. “Thanks, America.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything for a friend of Miss Harkness,” America chirped happily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For future reference, Miss Vidal doesn’t pay the entrance fee when she comes in,” Agatha said, lowering her voice so that the people in line behind them didn’t hear. “Put her on the </span>
<em>
<span>List</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>America nodded, clicking a few things on her computer and typing something in before giving Agatha a thumbs up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Her sister, too,” Agatha said, almost as an afterthought. “Dulce Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” America said, typing the first few letters of Dulce’s name, “she’s already on the list.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked, her eyes widening as she stepped around to stand behind America, looking at the monitor over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s a contributor,” America informed her. “She gets free access to the gallery for a year. We’re selling prints of her work in the shop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked at the screen, then her gaze went to Rio, who was very confused by the look the other woman was giving her. It was almost…dazed, like she was shocked to learn this information. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Did she not know who Dulce was? Dulce had said that Agatha spoke to her directly and personally on the night of her showcase, right here in this very gallery. Why did she look so taken aback?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seemed to snap out of it, schooling her features as she offered America another gentle smile. “Of course,” she said. “Completely slipped my mind. Thank you, dear.” She patted America on the shoulder then turned back to Rio. “I’ll see you in a bit,” she said, almost professionally detached. “Enjoy the artwork.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um,” Rio said, as Agatha started back toward the offices, “thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was thoroughly confused.</span>

<b>Chapter Eight</b>
</p><p>
<span>“I am going to murder you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be so dramatic,” Jen huffed, sitting at her desk with her laptop and a pile of papers in front of her. “You can go back to making out with the cute comedian as soon as you’ve signed all these papers.” She placed her hand on a stack of paper a foot high. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s all this for?” Agatha asked. “And we weren’t </span>
<em>
<span>making out</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t even get to </span>
<em>
<span>kiss</span>
</em>
<span>. Though they were pretty close…before Jen came in and ruined it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would make it a slow, painful death while also making it look like an accident. She wondered if sprinkling a little bleach on her tofu would do it. It could take weeks of agony…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then why were you lying on the floor?” Jen asked, raising one eyebrow as Agatha took one of the seats on the other side of her desk and reached for the pile of paper, which was littered with colorful tabs instructing her to ‘Sign’ here or ‘Initial’ there. She reached for the cup of pens and made sure to pick the most expensive-looking one, totally planning on slipping it into her pocket by accident. She knew it would drive Jen crazy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you usually have makeout sessions on the floor, Jen?” Agatha huffed. “Didn’t know you got down like that? Does Alice know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop deflecting,” Jen huffed. “And just </span>
<em>
<span>tell</span>
</em>
<span> me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, we weren’t making out,” Agatha said, her eyes skimming through the first release form. “We were…looking at the stars.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt her cheeks go hot as she avoided Jen’s gaze, trying to focus on the words swimming on the page. Unfortunately, she’d left her reading glasses in the drawer of her desk. Great.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just signed her name where she saw the pink tab, right below where Jen had already signed hers. They said the same thing every time, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen was handling the next showcase for the gallery. It was for a group of artists that painted scenes from all around the world, from Egypt to Italy, to Finland, to Brazil, and everywhere in between. They had a total of eighteen paintings between them. Each one required its own release form in order to be put in the showcase. After Agatha and Jen signed all of them, the artists themselves would get copies and start moving their work into the backroom of the gallery so that they could make prints to sell in their gift shop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The working title for the showcase was ‘Around the World in Eighteen Paintings’ which Agatha thought was pretty on the nose and lame, but she honestly couldn’t think of a better name for it and the promotional material had to go out that weekend on social media or turnout was likely to be very low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their gallery </span>
<em>
<span>survived</span>
</em>
<span> on showcases, for the most part. Ticket sales for everyday patrons weren’t as high as they could have been, in Agatha’s opinion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that she was really even thinking about that now as she signed form after form, initialing here and there, before setting each one aside. The letters didn’t really look like anything to her – just formless squiggles. Her mind was elsewhere as she signed them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Jen snapped her fingers in front of her as Agatha reached for the next form. Her fingers found the flat, bare surface of Jen’s desk instead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was nothing left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Jen asked, looking genuinely concerned as Agatha blinked up at her. “You look…dazed.” Then her lips turned up in a grin. “Thinking about Rio?” she sing-songed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha furrowed her brow and pursed her lips together. She wanted to deny it, but even if she was good at lying, she didn’t think she’d be any bit convincing at this moment. Because the honest truth was </span>
<em>
<span>yes</span>
</em>
<span>, she was certainly thinking about Rio right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More specifically, though, she was thinking about Rio’s sister, Dulce. Dulce Vidal. Dulce Vidal, who Rio had pretty much raised on her own while somehow still being a semi-normal teenager with hobbies and a part-time job.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce Vidal, who was a prodigy, a genius who had graduated early from high school </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> college. Dulce Vidal, who was a talented photographer, whose work had been featured in their last showcase at the gallery. Whose work </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span> had bid on and even </span>
<em>
<span>won</span>
</em>
<span> and brought home to hang in her studio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce Vidal, Rio’s sister, who had used </span>
<em>
<span>her sister</span>
</em>
<span> as the subject for her featured photograph. Agatha couldn’t believe she hadn’t seen it earlier: the figure in the photograph was </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>, with her cane, standing on a stage with the lights casting her almost entirely in shadow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted nothing more than to rush home to look at that photograph now, to stare at it and try to see all the features she’d missed previously, the ones that would point to Rio being the </span>
<em>
<span>obvious</span>
</em>
<span> subject of the piece. She wanted to see if she could make out her features in the shadows cast over her face. Would she be able to see Rio’s smile? That cute little gap between her teeth? The mischief in her eyes?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or would the confidence in her stance give away her identity, now that Agatha knew to look for it? Would she recognize the unique shape of Rio’s custom cane this time? Would she notice the tears in the knees of her jeans, also shrouded in shadow? Or the green converse that Rio wore to the support group and the park the last time they met? Would all of these parts have come together eventually if Agatha never learned that Dulce was Rio’s sister?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Would she have never learned that? She supposed she would have, eventually, if things continued to progress the way that they were.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which was how, exactly?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Jen’s voice broke through her reverie and she looked up, once again blinking up at her business partner/sister. “Girl, are you okay?” Jen asked. “You look flushed.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached under her desk and came back with a small bottle of spring water, pressing it into Agatha’s hand. “Take a drink, please, before you pass out or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, unscrewing the cap on the bottle and taking a long sip. It was refreshing, she had to admit, after she’d jogged five miles and then drank only a coffee afterward. Jen had gotten onto her before about needing to drink more water after runs. She tried to remember to do that, but coffee mostly took priority as her drink of choice to replenish her energy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yes, she was dumb about it. She knew that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finished the water in a few gulps and Jen just handed her another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are you getting these?” Agatha asked between sips. “And how are they so cold?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I installed a mini-fridge underneath my desk,” Jen informed her. “Mainly for my yogurt, so I don’t have to get up to go get it and nobody steals it now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried not to frown. She had been wondering why there was no more yogurt in the kitchen fridge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s smart,” she said. “Why do you have water in it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you’re </span>
<em>
<span>supposed</span>
</em>
<span> to drink water every now and then, Agatha,” Jen said, giving her a look like ‘duh’ that made Agatha start planning to sneak in when Jen was out to steal her fancy Greek yogurt and replace it with a cheap off-brand version. “Now, what’s going on with you? You seem…disturbed by something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath and slowly sipped at the last bits of water in the tiny bottle that Jen had given her, debating whether to tell her what she had just learned. It was ridiculous how tiny this town was. Would Jen just learn this eventually, anyway?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Did she already know?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you know about the girl whose photograph I bought last weekend?” she asked, finally looking up at an impatient Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s brows furrowed. “What?” she asked. “Um, not that much really.” She stood and walked over to one of her filing cabinets, opening a drawer and pulling out a file labeled ‘Davis Advanced Photography Showcase’. She flipped it open as she padded back (Agatha noticed for the first time that Jen had shed her shoes and was now walking barefoot across the pink fuzzy rug on her hardwood floor; her toes were freshly painted) and started thumbing through the forms. “Dulce, right?” she asked, looking up at Agatha as she sat back down in her chair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen pulled out a paperclipped file that had a print attached to it. It was a miniature version of the photograph she’d bought. Jen pulled the paperclip off and spread the papers over her desk. There was also a small picture of Dulce Vidal, in black and white, amongst the papers. She was smiling wide with dimpled cheeks and big, dark eyes, and Agatha couldn’t </span>
<em>
<span>believe</span>
</em>
<span> she hadn’t seen the similarities before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were </span>
<em>
<span>obviously</span>
</em>
<span> sisters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about her?” Jen asked after a moment of just looking down at the papers spread out in front of her. “What am I missing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pointed a finger at the figure in Dulce’s photograph. “What do you see?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh…a person?” Jen said. “I dunno, Agatha. It’s the subject of Dulce’s photograph. What am I </span>
<em>
<span>supposed</span>
</em>
<span> to see?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look closely,” Agatha instructed. “Who do you think that is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who…?” Jen looked down at the photograph, picking it up to get a closer look. Her eyes scanned the whole thing for a long moment, moving from corner to corner, methodically. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then they narrowed on something in the photograph.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Holy shit,” she gasped under her breath. “Is this…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “I can’t believe I didn’t see it before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do they even </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> each other?” Jen asked, picking up the picture of Dulce and holding it up next to the photograph of Rio in shadow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re sisters,” Agatha murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re </span>
<em>
<span>kidding!</span>
</em>
<span>” Jen gasped. “Holy shit.” Her gaze bounced between the two photographs, wide in shock as she took in all this new information.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she started laughing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not soft chuckles like “Oh wow, what a funny coincidence, huh?” but full-on </span>
<em>
<span>belly</span>
</em>
<span> laughs that got louder and more intense with every second until tears were spilling from her eyes and she was holding onto her sides as her shoulders shook. The photographs fluttered out of her hands, landing back onto the desk, just over Dulce’s release form for her art. “I’m sorry!” she snorted out at Agatha’s look of shock. “I’m s-sorry!” She laughed harder at the indignation in Agatha’s expression, unable to keep talking as all the breath in her lungs was taken out by her mirth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are the worst ‘sister’ ever,” Agatha huffed, standing up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to leave, but Jen’s hand around her wrist caught her, pulling her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, wait,” she said. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” She was still chuckling, trying desperately to clear the laughter from her throat as tears fell down her cheeks. “Oh god,” she said. “I’m so sorry, but I'm </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> not laughing at you. I’m just…this really </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> a miniscule town, huh? Like, what are the </span>
<em>
<span>odds</span>
</em>
<span>?” She let out another giggle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a deep sigh, her body sagging slightly as she slumped back down in the seat. “Apparently not as high as one would think,” she said. “I feel like I should have known earlier though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How </span>
<em>
<span>could</span>
</em>
<span> you?” Jen asked, reaching for a tissue to wipe at her eyes, carefully avoiding her mascara and eyeliner. “I mean, yeah, Westview is </span>
<em>
<span>ridiculously</span>
</em>
<span> tiny, but you still don’t expect shit like </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>,” she motioned to the pictures of Dulce and Rio, respectively, “to happen. It’s like some kind of…” she waved her hand around, trying to find the word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Greek tragedy?” Agatha asked, remembering the stories that her gran used to tell her and the book she’d given Agatha when she was thirteen years old, composed of Greek myths, plays, and other stories about idiots who ignored the all-knowing oracles and got themselves into Situations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think I’d call what you and Rio have a </span>
<em>
<span>tragedy</span>
</em>
<span>,” Jen said, patting Agatha’s hand. “That’s a bit pessimistic, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just going based off of my own history,” Agatha huffed. “Life hasn’t exactly been kind to me. I started life with a psychotic, hateful bitch of a mother, and ended up getting diagnosed with a degenerative neurological disease before my thirtieth birthday. What would you call that besides tragic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen shrugged. “Unlucky, for sure,” she said. “But getting diagnosed with MS led to you and Rio meeting in the first place, didn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We might have met, anyway,” Agatha pointed out. “Apparently she’s a regular at the cafe next door. And she and her sister like to come to the gallery quite often together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So do a lot of people,” Jen pointed out. “If she’d just been a patron, would you have even </span>
<em>
<span>considered</span>
</em>
<span> asking her out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I still haven’t,” Agatha pointed out. Jen scoffed. “I </span>
<em>
<span>haven’t</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe not officially,” Jen said, “but you can’t tell me that you two weren’t on a date when I walked into your office earlier. I mean, you were </span>
<em>
<span>stargazing</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They were fake stars!” Agatha protested. “Painted on my ceiling. I just came out of the bathroom and she was lying on my floor, looking at them. That doesn’t mean it was a date.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you go with her to get coffee?” Jen asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Agatha replied, avoiding her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said she’s apparently a regular at the coffee shop next door,” Jen reminded her. “You must have found out about that </span>
<em>
<span>somehow</span>
</em>
<span>. Did you two go there together?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha said. “It was on our way and we were trying to get out of the rain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ten feet from the gallery?” Jen snorted. “Okay. Who paid?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What does that matter?” Agatha huffed, squirming in her seat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, if you paid separately, then it’s </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> not a date,” Jen said. “It’s just two women (lesbians, albeit) hanging out and having a drink. But if one of you paid for both drinks…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath, readying herself for what was about to come next.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She paid,” she admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“HA!” Jen said, getting to her feet and pointing directly in Agatha’s face. Then she righted herself, clearing her throat and fixing her peach-colored blazer, smoothing a hand over her bald head. “Sorry,” she said. “But, as I said, that was definitely a date. And, since Rio paid first, she’s the top.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take that back!” Agatha demanded, slamming her fist on the table. “She’s not the top! She’s just faster!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Jen said, “whatever you say, </span>
<em>
<span>Bottom</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh!” Agatha grumbled, folding her arms over her chest and slumping back into her seat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“By all means,” Jen said, nonchalantly, as she glanced over the papers Agatha had just signed on her desk, “prove me wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prove you wrong how?” Agatha asked, raising one eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I dunno,” Jen snorted. “Go be a top? Nut up? Ask her on a real date and offer to pay for it. Do </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> other than hiding here in my office. That’s </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span> bottom behavior.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not hiding,” Agatha protested.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, you are,” Jen said. “You finished signing these papers over ten minutes ago. Any other day, you’d have Speedy Gonzalez’d your way out the door already, but you’re still here, having some kind of weird crisis about a photograph you bought from your crush’s sister when you could be spending time with said crush doing one of your favorite things in the world: looking at art. Like I said,” she tilted her head and gave Agatha a dazzling smile, “</span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span> bottom behavior.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck off, Kale,” Agatha growled, standing up and marching toward the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You go, girl,” Jen said, quite casually, as Agatha tugged open the door and stormed out. “Show her who’s boss.” She smirked and shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her smile fell immediately as Agatha shut off the lights at the last possible moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bottom,” Jen huffed, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was sitting on a bench in front of a large impressionist painting, obviously inspired by Monet in that it was a watery nature scene, but the technique wasn’t quite there and some of the colors were a bit too bright and distracted from the rest of the scene. Her head was tilted like a puppy, her hair still a little mussed from having spent so much time under the hood of her rain poncho.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even from the side, though, Agatha had to admit that she was stupidly hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t believe that she hadn’t realized it had been Rio in that photograph. How blind could she have been?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio said, without turning her head. Her lips quirked up in a smile as she continued to look up at the painting, her eyes scanning every last inch of it before she finally turned to meet Agatha’s eye. “Fancy seeing you here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha replied, suddenly feeling as though her throat were dry. She swallowed thickly and subtly rubbed her sweaty palms onto her suit pants. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was thankful that she’d had the forethought to keep some of her work clothes in the bathroom for the mornings she ran to work. She was now dressed in her favorite indigo-colored trousers and a lilac blouse. She had thrown her hair into loose braids that hung over her shoulders like ropes, and she’d slipped her feet into dark purple flats to complete the look. She watched as Rio’s eyes ran up her form, taking on her new outfit. She took in the other woman’s as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was wearing another plant pun shirt. It was teal with two potted plants talking to each other. One said, “Aloe, how have you been?” and the other said, “Long thyme, no see.” It was cute. She also wore ripped jeans and her usual green converse sneakers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Agatha said, walking up and taking a seat next to Rio on the bench, careful to keep at least a foot of space between them. “I had to sign a lot of papers and Jen would just </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> stop talking my ear off.” She rolled her eyes as if exasperated and hoped that Rio wouldn’t be able to see through the lie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No problem,” Rio said. “I’ve just been admiring the view.” She motioned to the impressionist painting. “I like the pops of random color,” she said. “They add character to the piece that Monet was often lacking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Agatha asked. “That’s one of the things that almost made Jen reject this piece. The prints are selling pretty well in the gift shop, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “I have one, too,” she said. “It’s hanging over my desk in my bedroom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Agatha asked. “Is it good for inspiration?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it’s just really pretty,” Rio chuckled. “I like pretty things.” She grinned at Agatha, her cheeks going pink. Agatha’s face warmed in response and she looked down at her lap, clearing her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha said, suddenly feeling very shy and very much like a Bottom, “Alice invited Jen to go to your show tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio said. “I told her to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, a real life Cupid, huh?” Agatha teased, nudging her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Laughter is a natural aphrodisiac,” Rio retorted. “Everybody knows that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, do they?” Agatha laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Rio insisted. “All my best dates began and ended with laughter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re sure they were laughing </span>
<em>
<span>with you</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“With me, </span>
<em>
<span>at</span>
</em>
<span> me…it’s all the same in the end,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You are a goof,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope so,” Rio laughed. “I make my living off of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted and took a deep breath. “Jen invited me to come, too,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To the show?” Rio asked. Agatha nodded. “Cool.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think Alice would be okay with me crashing her date with Jen?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, Dulce’s already going to be there,” Rio pointed out. “You could be </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> date.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God, no,” Agatha said, covering her face with her hands. “Not that there’s anything remotely wrong with your sister, of course. She’s just…she’s such a baby. I’d feel like a pedophile.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s twenty-three,” Rio laughed. “</span>
<em>
<span>You’re</span>
</em>
<span> only twenty-nine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still,” Agatha said. “She’s so tiny and squishy-faced. She looks like a toddler.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s the dimples,” Rio snorted. “I tell her all the time that they subtract at least a decade from her age.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And how does she take that?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like a brat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barked out a laugh at that and Rio joined her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had a really nice laugh. It was open and free and accompanied by pink cheeks and a flash of that adorable gap that she wanted to feel with her tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span> thought had Agatha ducking her head as she blushed, pushing a stray strand of hair behind her ear as she looked at her shoes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d really like it if you came,” Rio said, after a long moment of silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced up at her, eyes slightly wide with surprise. Rio’s shoulders were slightly hunched and there was a flush that was spreading to her ears. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You would?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Could always use more audience members,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, so this is about ticket sales, then?” Agatha teased, nudging her shoulder again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hardly,” Rio snorted in return. “I’m setting aside four at-will tickets for free tomorrow. One will be under your name, if you want it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“First, you pay for my coffee,” Agatha huffed, “and </span>
<em>
<span>then</span>
</em>
<span> you get me a free ticket to see your show? I have money, you know,” she said, motioning to the gallery around them. “I </span>
<em>
<span>am</span>
</em>
<span> a business owner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Buy me a drink tomorrow then,” Rio suggested. “After the show.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal,” Agatha said. “But don’t try to sneakily pay like you did this morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll try to control myself,” Rio said, raising her hands in surrender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then it’s a date,” Agatha said. Her throat went dry the second she realized what she had just said and the way Rio’s eyes widened in response, her cheeks pinkening. Agatha cleared her throat and fought against the urge to take the words back, to play it off as a slip of the tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> a bottom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Besides, wasn’t this what she wanted? A date with Rio? A </span>
<em>
<span>real </span>
</em>
<span>date?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Did Rio want that, too? She chanced a sideways glance at the other woman, who was back to looking up at the painting, her cheeks pink and her lips pressed together, but they were upturned in a shy smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yes, she was confident that Rio definitely wanted the same as she did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long have you been sitting at this one painting?” Agatha asked after a long moment just looking up at it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not long,” Rio said. “Maybe, like, five minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know there’s a whole exhibit of just plant paintings and photographs on the other side of that wall right there,” Agatha said, motioning to the left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Rio asked, immediately reaching for her cane and pushing herself to her feet. “Then what are we waiting for?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed as she followed her. “You didn’t do much walking around, did you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did,” Rio defended, “but this is a big gallery and my leg can only take so much, you know?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha said, frowning as she followed Rio around the corner to the plant-based art exhibit. “Do you get tired easily because of that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not really,” Rio said. “Especially not with the cane to help. It takes a lot of the pressure off, but pins and needles still become a thing after a while, you know? I walked around for about twenty minutes before I needed a rest. And then I just got caught up looking at that painting. And thinking about my set tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you already written it?” Agatha asked. “Like you know everything you’re going to say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not </span>
<em>
<span>every</span>
</em>
<span>thing,” Rio admitted, her eyes already scanning the photographs and paintings on the walls, various types of plants caught in different styles all around them. Agatha couldn’t remember what the name of this showcase had been. Some kind of plant pun, probably. Jen had handled it. “I do a lot of crowd work,” Rio continued, hobbling around the space, looking at each piece with wonder. “Wow, these are so good,” she breathed. “Do you have prints of them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha said. “This was July’s showcase. I have that one,” she pointed to a painting of some sunflowers stretching toward the sun through a wide window overlooking the city, almost photorealistic, “in my kitchen. The original.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“These aren’t originals?” Rio asked, furrowing her brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some of them are,” Agatha said. “But we do a silent auction during showcases for the artists. The gallery only takes ten percent and we make the rest of the money through art prints. I believe Dulce sold hers during her showcase.” She tried to sound casual and nonchalant, like she </span>
<em>
<span>wasn’t</span>
</em>
<span> the one who had bought said original and was now freaking about the </span>
<em>
<span>subject</span>
</em>
<span> of said original and </span>
<em>
<span>walking around </span>
</em>
<span>with said subject.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was chill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Rio said, nodding. “Do people still make bids on the original pieces?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha said, “all the time. That’s why we mark them.” She pointed at a purple dot on the wall next to a photograph of a great big plant that Agatha didn’t know the name of, but it was beautiful nonetheless. “This is an original,” she said. “You can scan the QR code on the info card next to it and see how much the piece costs. You can even follow the original piece to be notified if anybody makes a bid on it and make a counter-bid yourself. We’ve had full-out bidding wars happen in the middle of a Wednesday afternoon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Rio said, shaking her head. “What piece was that for?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not going to believe me,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What, was it a picture of a sad clown or something?” Rio snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, your self-portrait didn’t garner that much interest,” Agatha retorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oof, ouch,” Rio laughed, placing her hand over her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winced. “Too mean?” she asked, suddenly self-conscious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just mean enough,” Rio assured her. “A+ mean joke.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha preened a little bit. “Thank you,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what was the winning piece that caused such a tizzy?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a painting of a pair of tits,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have tits in this gallery?” Rio asked, looking all around as if a bare chest would just appear out of thin air. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not the kind you’re thinking of,” she said. “Follow me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hobbled after her to another area that was filled with…birds. She pointed to a large painting of two tiny birds cuddled together on a branch. They were black and yellow fuzzy birds, eyes closed as they nuzzled their little beaks together, their heads forming a heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The plaque next to them said “</span>
<em>
<span>Great Tits!</span>
</em>
<span> Acrylic on canvas, 2025” and the remnants of the purple circle sticker were still stuck to the wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is…a little disappointing,” Rio said, shoulders sagging slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perv,” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, breasts are beautiful,” Rio defended. “They’re all over art galleries. Don’t be a prude.” She looked back at the little fuzzy birds. “These are cute, too, I guess.” Then her eyes narrowed and she stepped closer. “Are these…are these both </span>
<em>
<span>female</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked, looking at the birds. “I don’t know. I’m not a bird expert.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“An ornithologist,” Rio corrected. “I’m not, either, but I’ve spent enough time in biology courses to know a little something about this. Yep, these are definitely both female.” She pointed to one of them. “That black strip going down its belly is too thin for this to be a male. The other one is the same.” She stepped back, arms crossed like a dad looking at the handiwork of the deck he just built with his own two hands. “These birds are lesbians.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha said, eyes widening slightly. “I wonder if Mrs. Porter knew that when she bought it,” she said. “She bought it for her husband for their anniversary. He’s an avid birder, according to her. I’m sure </span>
<em>
<span>he</span>
</em>
<span> would have known right away that they were both female.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long ago did she win the bidding?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About a month ago,” Agatha said. “She came in and got it the very same day. She was </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> excited because this is apparently her husband’s favorite bird. I’ve heard no complaints from either of them since then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Maybe he didn’t notice. Maybe he was too caught up in the woman he loved – as clueless as she must be about birds – and happy that she knew him enough to get him a painting of his favorite bird. How much did she pay for it, anyway?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Her final bid was just under two grand,” Agatha informed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a low whistle. “Two grand for a couple of lesbian tits,” she commented. “Good for her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “We sell prints in the gift shop, you know,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, I could always use more lesbian tits in my apartment,” Rio said, brightly. “I’ll have to go through on my way out, which,” she looked at her phone and frowned, “should probably be soon. I still have to work on my set for this weekend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you usually talk about?” Agatha asked, trying to sound casual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“MS, mostly,” Rio said. “And some current events. I try to make things as fresh as I can without going too doom and gloom with it. I do some crowd work, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve seen it on your TikTok,” Agatha admitted, flushing when Rio’s eyes snapped to her. She cleared her throat, avoiding the other woman’s gaze. “Jen sent a couple to me,” she lied. “They’re not bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you think I’m funny?” Rio said in a breathy, girlish voice, clasping her hands under her chin and batting her eyelashes at Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus,” Agatha muttered under her breath, walking away from her, but she was unable to fully bite back her own smile as Rio almost immediately caught up to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, wait,” Rio laughed. “I’m just kidding. Thank you for your engagement with the videos. You </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> like them, didn’t you? Dulce has been going feral over the social media lately.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I liked a couple,” Agatha said. “Even huffed out a laugh through my nose once or twice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio placed a hand on her chest, touched. “Agatha Harkness, you spoil me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you take </span>
<em>
<span>anything</span>
</em>
<span> seriously?” Agatha laughed, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope,” Rio said, grinning cheekily. “But I’ll try, </span>
<em>
<span>for you</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her heart flip in her chest at that. It was ridiculous because Rio was </span>
<em>
<span>obviously</span>
</em>
<span> joking and teasing her…but there was a look in her eyes as she tilted her head and gave Agatha that tiny, adorable little gap-toothed grin. A look that went far deeper than just a ha-ha funny little joke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wondered, briefly, if the words were more genuine than they sounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cleared her throat, breaking eye contact. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she said, turning away, “let’s get you those tits then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yay tits!” Rio said, far too loudly, raising her fist in the air as she followed Agatha across the gallery, all tension immediately dissipating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, at least.</span>

<b>Chapter Nine</b>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal did not get stage fright.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She never had. Not since her first time at an open mic night at her school when she was seventeen years old, on one of the odd nights her parents remembered that </span>
<em>
<span>they</span>
</em>
<span> were, in fact, the parents of a five-year-old, not her. She had only gone to support one of her teammates, Ana, who was the class clown and wanted to try her hand at actually telling jokes in front of a crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As it turned out, goofing off during class and being a smart-ass was way less nerve-wracking than doing an actual set like a real comedian. Ana had frozen on stage with the spotlight shining right in her face, which went almost impressively pale in a matter of seconds while people in the crowd waited for her to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had come to her rescue (only partially because she had the tiniest crush on Ana and her curly black hair and singular dimple in her left cheek) and shooed her off-stage as she began telling a funny story about how she mistook an essay prompt in her philosophy class and ended up writing a whole five-page paper on Youth in Asia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was apparently good enough to bag me an A in Miss Stabile’s class,” she said to the roaring laughter of her classmates, “but now I’m required to go for extra lessons in spelling. If you ask me, Miss S should be required to take lessons in writing because you can’t see </span>
<em>
<span>shit</span>
</em>
<span> on that board.” There was more laughter and a few cheers of agreement about the young teacher’s </span>
<em>
<span>atrocious</span>
</em>
<span> penmanship.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she knew it, she’d completed a whole five-minute stand up routine before being shooed off the stage for the next scheduled act. She got a standing ovation as she stepped off the stage, receiving pats on the back and congratulations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ana had even pressed a kiss to her cheek, which was the highlight of young gay Rio’s life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After that, she told jokes and did stand-up whenever she could, even when she had Dulce hanging off of her leg. Sometimes </span>
<em>
<span>especially</span>
</em>
<span> when Dulce was there because, somehow, her giggles made Rio’s joke that much funnier to the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, yeah, Rio </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> had stage fright. If anything, she felt </span>
<em>
<span>energized</span>
</em>
<span> by a crowd. The more people out there, the better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that didn’t mean she didn’t get nervous when there were </span>
<em>
<span>certain</span>
</em>
<span> people in the crowd. Specifically, </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> person. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One person with long, curly dark hair and eyes the shade of crystal…who isn’t even here yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at the time on her phone. She had ten minutes before she had to go on. Most of the seats were already filled. Alice sat in the front row of folding chairs, next to three “Reserved” signs, looking at her own watch. Jen must have been running late, too.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Obviously, dumbass</span>
</em>
<span>, the mean little voice in her head said. </span>
<em>
<span>Does it look like she’s sitting there to you?</span>
</em>
<span> Rio told the voice to fuck off and shut the curtain as she started to pace, clutching her cane with one hand and looking at the notes for her set with the other. She didn’t really ever need them because she had a pretty great memory and Dulce always held up notecards in the front if there was too long of a pause on stage, just to remind her which joke to go to next in case Rio ever </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> forget, but it was something to do, she reasoned, that could take her mind off the waiting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, good crowd!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio jumped at her sister’s voice and nearly toppled over as she turned to see Dulce standing there, already holding her phone up to film Rio, as she did nearly every Saturday.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Say cheese!” she said, tilting her head so that Rio could see her big grin. She never failed to make Rio smile in return.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight was no exception.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave the camera the finger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very nice,” Dulce laughed. She put the phone down and slipped it back into her pocket, peeking back through the curtain. “Why is Alice wearing a bowtie?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She has a date,” Rio informed her with a grin. “Didn’t I tell you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No…” Dulce said, her grin widening. “Have you met her yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yep,” Rio confirmed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And…? What’s she like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Annoying,” Rio retorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce’s brow furrowed. “Really? Then why are you letting this happen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Letting</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio snorted. “Alice is a grown woman, Dulce. She can date whomever the hell she wants.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But then </span>
<em>
<span>we</span>
</em>
<span> have to deal with her new girlfriend’s annoying behavior,” Dulce practically whined, pouting at Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eh, you’ll be fine,” Rio laughed, patting her on the cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce swatted her hand away and peeked back out through the curtain, her eyes widening and her mouth gaping. Immediately, Rio knew that </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> was there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Jen was, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that Jennifer </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> Kale!?” Dulce hissed in Rio’s direction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It might be,” Rio said, avoiding her wide-eyed gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And…Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Rio asked, pretending to read through her notes, but suddenly she couldn’t read at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why the </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span> is Agatha Harkness here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is?” Rio asked, her voice cracking on the second syllable, her cheeks going hot. “Wow, what a small world.”</span>
</p><p><span>“She’s sitting in one of our reserved seats in the front,” Dulce pointed out. “Which means that her name was on the list at will-call. Alice is </span><em><span>holding</span></em> <em><span>Jennifer Kale’s hand, Rio</span></em><span>!” </span></p><p>
<span>“Whoa, what a funny random happenstance,” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“RIO, </span>
<em>
<span>YOU</span>
</em>
<span> GIVE WILL-CALL ALL THE NAMES!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shhhh!” Rio said, placing her hand over Dulce’s mouth as she heard murmurs from the crowd. She peeked out to see a few faces turned toward the curtains and she immediately pulled them completely closed and tugged Dulce away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why the hell didn’t you </span>
<em>
<span>tell</span>
</em>
<span> me that Jennifer Kale and Agatha Harkness were going to be here?!” Dulce demanded in a stage whisper as Rio pulled her as far from the curtains as she could. “And why didn’t you tell me that </span>
<em>
<span>Jennifer Kale</span>
</em>
<span> was dating Alice?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is their first date,” Rio said, “and that’s really all I can say about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?!” Dulce squeaked. “No, no, no! You </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> to say more! When did this happen? How do they even know each other?!? Why is Agatha Harkness third-wheeling?!?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Technically, she’s fourth-wheeling,” Rio murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> are kinda the third wheel,” Rio pointed out. “I mean, you were always gonna be here, whether Agatha showed up or not, right? You and Alice always sit together. She just happened to invite a date tonight…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God,” Dulce said, her big eyes getting even bigger. “I’m third-wheeling Jennifer Kale’s </span>
<em>
<span>date</span>
</em>
<span>! And Agatha Harkness is here, too! Am I on a date with Agatha Harkness?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” Rio hissed, placing her hands on Dulce’s shoulders as her sister legitimately began to hyperventilate. “You are not on a date with Agatha Harkness. Trust me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But–” Her chest was moving too fast, her cheeks very pink, her eyes about to pop out of her head. “But what if–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Breathe</span>
</em>
<span>, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio said, pulling her into a hug and rubbing her back like she’d done when Dulce was a little girl getting </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> too excited or upset over something. Rio was thankful that she was still taller than Dulce so that the girl could slot her face into the crook of her neck. “Breathe. You’re okay. Just be chill, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But, Agatha…” She took a deep, shuddering breath and pulled away, her eyebrows knitted together. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh…yeah?” Rio replied, confused. “That’s Agatha Harkness, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But we’ve never called her by anything but her full name, but you just called her…</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who has the time to say her full name right now?” Rio huffed, avoiding her gaze. “I have, like, two minutes before the curtains part, babe. Go take your seat and we’ll talk later, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce narrowed her eyes at her older sister. “Yes,” she said, “we will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> like the tone of her voice, but there was nothing she could do about that now as Dulce was already making her way out the side door and appearing in the crowd, cautiously walking to where Alice sat in the front row. Alice immediately embraced her and started making introductions while Dulce stammered out a greeting to both Jen and Agatha while Rio watched through the crack in the curtains, her heart beginning to pound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was dressed just as casually as always, but there was something in the way her lavender blouse hung on her frame under the deep violet cardigan. There was something about the tighter fit of her black jeans and the way her hair fell in much looser curls than usual. Her eyes were lined in black and there was definitely some eyeshadow on her eyelids and a sheen to her lips that spoke of gloss. Rio wondered, briefly, if it was flavored.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kind of hoped she’d get to find out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought made her heart stutter in her chest as she let the curtains close and she stumbled slightly to her stool. Her leg was tingling and she needed to sit. She perched herself as she waited for the sign that the curtains were about to part. She gripped her cane in front of her for a long moment, her fingers tracing a familiar flower carved into the wood as she steadied her breathing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal never got stage fright, and she wasn’t about to start now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness hadn’t been to a lot of comedy shows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She liked stand-up comedy, sometimes. She liked to watch them on the TV at the gym when it was too icy to run outside while she ran on a treadmill. She preferred female comedians for the most part. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She never thought she’d be interested in </span>
<em>
<span>dating</span>
</em>
<span> one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that she and Rio were dating. This was just a show. She was supporting a friend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A hot friend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A hot, lesbian friend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A hot, lesbian friend who was the subject of a photograph she kept in her studio, where her most prized and beloved art pieces hung.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A hot, lesbian friend who she very nearly kissed earlier on her office floor while they gazed up at glow-in-the-dark stars and hand-painted planets and galaxies while Agatha shared more with Rio than with most people she’d known for much longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that didn’t mean they were </span>
<em>
<span>dating</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Did it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>No. No, it didn’t, she decided.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she found her stomach fluttering with nerves as she and Jen pulled up to </span>
<em>
<span>The Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span> in downtown Westview. It was surrounded by other bars and restaurants on one side of the street and apartments on the other. Agatha was lucky to find a parking space on a Saturday night. There wasn’t much to do in Westview, New Jersey, after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen was dressed to the nines in a dusty rose pink dress that flared slightly around her knees and showed off her shoulders and collarbones. She had replaced most of her silver piercings with some gold pieces and gave herself a deep red lipstain that made her lips look more plump. Her eyes were outlined in kohl, making them look smoky and mesmerizing – you know, to somebody who might have actually been attracted to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look like you have two black eyes and a bloody mouth,” Agatha had said when Jen slid into the passenger seat of her orange Subaru Crosstrek, wrinkling her nose. “You sure you wanna go looking like that? You’re probably gonna scare the poor girl off.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen scoffed. “Please,” she said. “Alice grew up around rockstars. This is likely </span>
<em>
<span>nothing</span>
</em>
<span> to her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re saying she’ll pretty much be bored by it?” Agatha teased, pulling away from the curb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen glared at her, giving her a curt punch in the shoulder, which made Agatha let out a laugh even as she flinched away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Calm your tits,” she said. “</span>
<em>
<span>Jeez!</span>
</em>
<span> Does Alice know how violent you are?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yet,” Jen purred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wrinkled her nose. “Gross, Jen,” she said. Jen had cackled in response.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span> was wedged between a pizza shop that boasted being open until midnight (which was late for Westview, even on a Saturday night) and some kind of hibachi place with floor-to-ceiling windows. Agatha watched flames jump as a woman shouted something in Japanese while the patrons applauded for her and she bowed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Jen asked, nudging Agatha’s shoulder as they walked up the street to the bar. They were only a few feet away when it seemed as though Agatha’s feet got stuck in cement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed thickly and nodded. “Yeah,” she said, “I’m fine. I’m not the one going on a first date with a rockstar’s daughter.” She grinned up at Jen, nudging her side with her elbow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even with the dark makeup, Jen visibly flushed and rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” she huffed as they continued their walk to the bar’s entrance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forced her feet forward. Her jeans were very tight tonight. She didn’t wear incredibly tight jeans often. She preferred looser, boot-cut jeans. But these made her ass look </span>
<em>
<span>fantastic</span>
</em>
<span> – at least according to Jen. She’d been there when Agatha bought them, when they’d gone to lunch with Naomi and she’d enticed them into taking a longer lunch break to check out some new chic store that catered mainly to teens and college kids. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s be young again!” Naomi had said, tugging on a pair of heart-shaped sunglasses. “We can play dress-up!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen had rolled her eyes, but she’d done so affectionately, grinning sideways at Agatha as they started checking out the selection of over-priced jeans. Agatha had picked out a pair that she would probably have </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> actually bought had Jen not let out a low whistle and told her that she didn’t realize Agatha could actually have </span>
<em>
<span>definition in your backside, Harkness</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Naomi had swatted her for that comment, but all three of them laughed as Agatha put them back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two months later, Naomi had gifted the jeans to her for Christmas.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Three years later, Agatha tugged them from her dresser, tags and all, and tried them on. They were slightly looser than they’d been in the store. But still tighter than anything she normally wore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And her ass </span>
<em>
<span>still</span>
</em>
<span> looked fantastic in them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Agatha paired them with a simple purple blouse that was made of a papery material and a comfy cardigan that she could get away with wearing in lieu of a jacket on the cool Autumn night. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s off-shoulder dress was definitely too cool for the weather, but she didn’t let it bother her. Agatha predicted she would have already stolen the cardigan right off Agatha’s back if it did, anyhow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bar was warm as they stepped inside, and there were flags hanging up all over the place. Most were pride flags, but there were some national flags, as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When do you think is the right time to come out as Irish?” Jen whispered in Agatha’s ear, making her snort as they made their way to the back of the bar, where a stage had been set up with several rows of folding chairs and a few tables. The first row was all chairs, set just three feet from the edge of the stage. Most of the row had been filled save for three spots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha immediately spotted Alice’s head of black hair and fiery orange streaks. She glanced up at Jen, who was giving Alice a goofy grin already. She was </span>
<em>
<span>smitten</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aww,” Agatha teased, under her breath. “Someone’s in </span>
<em>
<span>lo-ove</span>
</em>
<span>.” She nudged Jen in the side again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen responded by flicking her ear. “Shut the fuck up,” she huffed, but it was hard to keep that grin off her face for too long. Especially when Alice turned and spotted them, waving them both over as she stood. “Ohmygod, Agatha,” Jen gasped, “she’s wearing a </span>
<em>
<span>bow</span>
</em>
<span> tie. She’s so cute.” She placed one hand over her heart as they approached a woman standing at the back of the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tickets?” she asked them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our names should be on the list,” Agatha said. “Agatha Harkness and Jennifer Kale.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah,” the woman smiled, “friends of Rio. Very good. Do you have your IDs?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Jen fished their IDs out – Jen from her purse and Agatha from her </span>
<em>
<span>very tight </span>
</em>
<span>pocket. They handed them over and the woman checked them, humming and nodding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fantastic,” she said, holding up a stamp. “Let me see your left hands, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They each held out their left hand for a stamp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted at the sight of a ‘crone’ (appropriately labeled as such) next to the words ‘Over 21’ on her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You guys allow people </span>
<em>
<span>under</span>
</em>
<span> 21 in this bar after dark?” she asked, raising one brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This bar is eighteen and older,” the woman informed her. “Under 21’s get the designation of ‘Maiden’ when applicable. You can’t order a drink without getting carded and stamped.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did we even </span>
<em>
<span>need</span>
</em>
<span> tickets for the show?” Jen asked. “Couldn’t we have sat at the bar and watched?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, sure,” the woman said, “but not many people who are actually interested in the show prefer to sit there. The sound gets a little wonky the further you are from the stage. We have, like, one speaker in this entire place hooked up to Rio’s mic. And it’s behind her. Best way to catch the jokes is by sitting in the audience, which is full tonight, by the way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Agatha said, her eyes widening a little. “She must bring in a lot of business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, you have </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span> idea,” the woman said. “She’s hilarious. Best decision Tony ever made was giving her a regular gig.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tony?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The owner.” The woman nodded in the direction of the bar, where a man with a pair of shades and a goatee was wiping down a glass while laughing with a few patrons. “His daughter, Morgan, came out a few years ago and he opened this place for her. It’s </span>
<em>
<span>technically</span>
</em>
<span> not a lesbian bar, but she’s gonna be the owner someday, so he decided to market it as a queer safe space. Great guy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s so sweet,” Jen said, placing her hand over her heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha said, looking over her shoulder at the guy again. He watched as a teen girl with braces and bright eyes stepped up next to him, hugging him around the waist as he laughed and pressed his lips to the top of her head. She looked at him like he hung the moon and he looked down at her like she was his whole world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wondered if her father ever looked at her like that. She </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> her mother never did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, Ags,” Jen urged, taking her by the arm. “The show is gonna start soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t want a drink?” Agatha asked, blinking rapidly before turning to Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have waitresses for the show,” the usher informed them. “Just flag one of them down and they’ll bring you anything you want. Rio said everything’s on her tab tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Typical,” Agatha huffed. “I literally told her </span>
<em>
<span>I’d</span>
</em>
<span> be the one buying tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh,” Jen said, “then I’ll take a–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha huffed, tugging her down the aisle to the front row. “You have your own date to buy you drinks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So this </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> a date for you and Rio,” Jen teased under her breath, a little bit gloaty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s not–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Alice!” Jen cooed, ignoring Agatha (but keeping that infuriating smirk on her face) as she wriggled out of her grasp and reached out to hug the shorter woman. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice really did look kind of cute in her bowtie, Agatha had to admit. She was also wearing a short-sleeve, collared navy blue shirt that complemented the burnt umber shade of the bowtie around her neck. Her hair was half-up in a messy bun on the back of her head, and her eyes were lined thickly in black eyeliner. Agatha doubted she was wearing much other makeup, but she looked nice, nonetheless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And nervous. She looked very, very nervous – like a little kid on picture day trying very hard not to ruin the clothes their mother had hand-picked and ironed for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was adorable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi, Jen,” Alice said, mooning up at her. Agatha saw the slight shake in her hands even as Alice tried to hide them. “Hi, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Alice,” Agatha said, poking her head around Jen’s freakishly tall body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look so good,” Jen said, stroking the bowtie. Agatha could practically see Alie’s tail begin to wag as her entire body perked up, her cheeks going as pink as Jen’s dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks!” she said. “You too!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen giggled – </span>
<em>
<span>giggled like a schoolgirl</span>
</em>
<span> – and took Alice’s hand, the two of them claiming the seats on the aisle and forcing Agatha to shimmy past them to the center-most seats. There was still one left. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Dulce’s seat</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was a bit nervous about seeing the younger artist again, especially having the knowledge she did now. Did Dulce have that same knowledge? Did </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> know that Agatha had won the silent auction on her photograph? Did </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head was swimming with questions as she took her seat next to Jen in the first row.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss Harkness?” a tentative voice greeted. Agatha jumped a little bit, turning just as Dulce approached, looking very shy and so very young.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was right: it was the dimples that made her look younger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even with that crone stamped on her hand, she looked like a child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A child that Rio had apparently raised when she was still a child herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, this was getting so complicated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forced a smile as she stood and reached out, pulling Dulce into a hug. “Hello, Dulce,” she said, warmly, obviously shocking the girl by the way she stiffened in Agatha’s arms. “How are you, dear?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m okay,” Dulce said, relaxing slightly after a moment. She pulled back with a slightly more open smile, glancing between Agatha and Jen, who greeted her from behind Agatha. “Hi, Miss Kale,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh,” Jen said, “as if we’re her kindergarten teachers. Call me </span>
<em>
<span>Jen</span>
</em>
<span>, sweetie. And this is </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>. We’re </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> in our twenties.” She reached around Agatha to press air kisses to Dulce’s cheeks before sitting back down with Alice, who probably gave her a little wave or nod or something else that Agatha didn’t see because she was still facing Dulce.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Dulce said, also taking her seat as Agatha mirrored her, “how, exactly, do you two know Alice and my sister?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened at that. Rio hadn’t </span>
<em>
<span>told</span>
</em>
<span> her? Why?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um,” Agatha said, glancing back at Jen and Alice. Jen was giving her a questioning look like even </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> wasn’t quite sure what to say. Alice echoed the look, tilting her head slightly at Agatha. “It’s kind of a long story…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just at that moment, the lights started to dim around them, signaling the beginning of the show.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ladies and gentlemen,” a voice said from behind the curtain, “please take your seats now and finish placing your drink orders. If you need a drink during the show, please don’t get up. Just flag down one of our servers and they’ll get it for you. You won’t want to miss Westview’s very own “Sit-Down” Comedian, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio Vidal</span>
</em>
<span>. Put your hands together for Miss Rio Vidal, everybody!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Dulce simultaneously turned toward the stage just as the curtains parted, revealing Rio on her stool, adjusting her mic. Agatha’s throat went dry at the sight of her, her cheeks going pink and hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hoped the rapidly dimming lights on the audience and the brightening lights on the stage hid it well enough. The applause around them seemed to cover the sound of her heart pounding in her chest well enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Rio’s gaze snagged on hers almost immediately, and she gave Agatha a coy, lopsided grin as she leaned forward to start talking into the mic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said, her voice warm and sweet as honey. It felt, momentarily, like they were the only two people in the room, energy crackling between them, enough to power a small nation, before her gaze shifted to the audience behind Agatha. “How’s everybody doing tonight?” Rio asked, her smile widening as her voice got louder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There were cheers in response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, just okay, then?” Rio asked. “I </span>
<em>
<span>said</span>
</em>
<span>, ‘HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING TONIGHT?’!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The cheers got louder around them. Even people at the bar behind them were cheering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s more like it!” Rio said. “Hi, all! Thanks so much for coming out here tonight. My name is Rio, as most of you know, because most of you are alcoholics and were here anyway.” Some laughter throughout the crowd. “Nah, I’m just kidding. You’re not </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> alcoholics. </span>
<em>
<span>Some</span>
</em>
<span> of you are lesbians.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>More cheers scattered throughout the crowd. Agatha laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s definitely a lot of overlap there, too,” Rio said. “Don’t be modest. Just make sure you tip your waitresses. They gotta make a living around here, too.” The waitresses cheered. “I gotchu,” Rio said, blowing a kiss to the servers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a frisson of what could vaguely be described as jealousy (though she would never admit it) run down her spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyway, there are quite a few familiar faces here tonight. I love to see that. Thank you for paying my tab tonight, guys, I really appreciate it.” More laughter. Rio beamed, flashing that gap between her teeth. “Okay, so let’s get to the jokes, then.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cheered with the rest of the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winked at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s pulse pounded in her neck as the curtains opened, but there was a sense of calm that came over her every time she saw the familiar faces of her audience each week. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew most of the people in the crowd. They were bar regulars. They ran tabs as they laughed uproariously at her jokes. They clapped the loudest sometimes. Some of them could get obnoxious, but there were never any serious incidents in the few years since she’d started performing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was Alice, who had been showing up to as many show nights as she could manage since they met at group therapy. She’d been there for Rio pretty much since that first meeting, which…well, Rio had never really had a best friend before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sure, she’d had friends. She’d had friends in school. She was a funny, nice, smart, and somewhat sociable person. But when Dulce was born, she’d become a caretaker, which didn’t allow for much of a social life when her parents were expecting her to share in – and then take over – parental duties whenever she was home. She couldn’t really have playdates when she was expected to feed or change a baby. Her parents rarely allowed her to go over to other kids’ homes because they might need her help with something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In high school, it got easier to socialize because Dulce was also getting older and easier to handle. She was a good kid and could be distracted with a snack and some crayons and paper when Rio needed her to be. But nobody in her life was ever her </span>
<em>
<span>best</span>
</em>
<span> friend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not like Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Except for Dulce. She could definitively say that, despite their difficult and definitely damaging childhood, Dulce was her very best friend. A best friend who showered her with love and affection and gifts on both Mother’s and Father’s Day, mind you. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mother had been upset by this the first time it happened, when Dulce had bypassed her the morning of Mother’s Day and brought her handmade card straight to Rio at the breakfast table instead of to her. She was six and had learned that her biggest support wasn’t the woman who’d given birth to her, but rather the one who had raised her and never once complained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce was unapologetic about it, too, which Rio had tried not to laugh (or cry) about when she’d opened the card, which had a dead daisy in it (one that Dulce had picked herself during recess the previous week) and found a picture of herself and Dulce holding hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(She still had that card, somewhere.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their dad was less concerned when Dulce pulled the same stunt on Father’s Day and Rio received a drawing of herself standing at a grill (pretty impressively drawn even for an artistic six-year-old) and holding a basketball on her hip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(She still had that one, too.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio always figured she could have resented having to take care of Dulce as an adolescent, being forced to raise her while her parents were able to live their lives pretending to be childless adults eight percent of the time (generously) and only coming around when they wanted to do something fun with the daughters they seemed to only remember existed on occasion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But what good would that have done? What good would it have done her to be angry all the time at somebody who didn’t choose to be born, let alone to be born to two irresponsible and selfish assholes? Dulce needed support and love, and Rio, despite everything her parents put her through, was able and willing to give it to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she’d do it all over again without hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did a few warm up jokes about the length of time she’d been doing her “sit down” comedy at Westview, which morphed into her talking about her leg.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t like to call it my </span>
<em>
<span>bad leg</span>
</em>
<span>,” she said, getting up from her stool as she pulled the mic from the stand and waited for the feeling to fully reach her toes before she took a few steps across the stage. “Bad implies that it’s doing this on purpose, which I don’t fully believe.” She got a few chuckles for that as she hobbled. “It’s not like my leg </span>
<em>
<span>chooses</span>
</em>
<span> when to work perfectly; it’s like this </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> the time. Not like I’m going to wake up one day in the middle of the field because it decided to go for a run without my knowledge.” The crowd laughed and Rio grinned. “My god, could you imagine? Having a leg that </span>
<em>
<span>decides</span>
</em>
<span> when it works right. Like those people who pretend to be bad at chores so they don’t have to do them? What losers, amiright…ladies?” There were some cheers from the audience, mostly female. “Yeah, I know the kinda shit some of y’all go through with the men in your lives. You have my </span>
<em>
<span>deepest</span>
</em>
<span> condolences, but I’ve literally </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> been so happy to be a lesbian in my life.” Even louder cheers, some from the very same women. “I mean, not that women can’t </span>
<em>
<span>also</span>
</em>
<span> play that…what’s it called?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Weaponized incompetence!” a few people shouted from the audience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, that!” Rio laughed. “We’ve got some victims here tonight. My condolences, ladies. You deserve better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I do!” one voice replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell him!” Rio said, with a snap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s my </span>
<em>
<span>wife</span>
</em>
<span>!” the person said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh! You see?!” Rio said, grinning at the rest of the audience as she knocked her cane on the ground. “Lesbians can be incompetent, too! Girl power!” She snapped while the audience laughed. “We truly can be anything we set our mind to.” She perched herself femininely on her stool, giving the crowd a pouty face before dissolving into laughter. “Seriously, though, why do people </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> that? You put more energy into </span>
<em>
<span>pretending</span>
</em>
<span> you can’t do something than actually just </span>
<em>
<span>doing</span>
</em>
<span> the thing. And all you’re doing is annoying the </span>
<em>
<span>other</span>
</em>
<span> person in your relationship. That can </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> turn out well for at least some of you. Has nobody ever seen </span>
<em>
<span>Snapped</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That got her a few laughs, but not enough in her opinion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, there are some people here who don’t know what that show’s about and it </span>
<em>
<span>shows.</span>
</em>
<span> Go home and watch it. And start loading the dishwasher </span>
<em>
<span>correctly</span>
</em>
<span>, </span>
<em>
<span>Jerry</span>
</em>
<span>.” She gave a playful glare to the audience. “Or Mary.” She shrugged. “Just do what you’re supposed to do to make your spouse’s and </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> life easier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She got cheers and applause for that and Rio let it soak in for a moment, taking a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who here likes tits?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Several hands went up. There were cheers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god!” Rio gushed, placing a hand on her chest. “Me, too!” She snorted to herself as people laughed. “</span>
<em>
<span>Actually</span>
</em>
<span>, I saw a couple of Great Tits just yesterday here in town.” She glanced down to Agatha, who was already pressing her lips together to suppress her laughter. “I saw some boobies, too. And a couple of </span>
<em>
<span>incredible</span>
</em>
<span> hooters. I mean, they are just </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>beautiful, you know?” She sighed dreamily, looking off into the distance for a moment. “And can you believe I didn’t even have to go to some club to see them? They were just right out in the open for me to gawk at, in the middle of an </span>
<em>
<span>art</span>
</em>
<span> gallery, no less! Right here, in Westview!” There were some gasps throughout the audience and Rio grinned.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Perfect</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She feigned confusion. “What?” she said. “You guys have never seen a pair of nice tits in an art gallery? Uncultured. Art galleries are a </span>
<em>
<span>fine</span>
</em>
<span> place to showcase great tits and boobies and hooters</span>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
<span> Don’t act all scandalized now when you were just cheering for them not ten seconds ago! </span>
<em>
<span>The Craft</span>
</em>
<span> uptown has a whole installation centered around a pair of great tits.” More murmurs and gasps. “Oh ye Puritans,” Rio laughed. “You see them </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> the time out in the wild, don’t you? They’re all over the place in this country. You see them in books, on TV, in magazines…hell, I’ve seen them in the park a time or two.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dead silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Except Agatha, who looked like she was about to do her little snorty laugh. Rio wanted to bask in that moment just before she completely broke. She took a beat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then two.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you people have against birds?” she demanded playfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence broke with a murmur of confusion from most in the crowd. Those who understood immediately began to laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Including Agatha, whose snorts echoed despite her attempts to smother them. Rio couldn’t fight her responding laughter as she attempted to continue with the joke, putting on a faux scandalized look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait a second,” she said, eyeing the crowd with the caution of a church lady clutching her pearls. “Wait a </span>
<em>
<span>gosh-darn</span>
</em>
<span> second! Did you all think I was talking about…” she leaned in to whisper into the mic, “</span>
<em>
<span>breasts</span>
</em>
<span>?” Murmurs of affirmation, confirmation, and confusion were her reply and she let out a dramatic gasp. “How </span>
<em>
<span>dare</span>
</em>
<span> you! I am a fucking lady!” She turned up her nose, but she couldn’t keep herself from peeking out at Agatha, who was in hysterics while Alice and Dulce stared at her, wide-eyed and confused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen, obviously, knew </span>
<em>
<span>exactly</span>
</em>
<span> what Rio was referencing, but she seemed more entertained by Agatha’s red face and snorty laughs as she fought to contain herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart did a stupid little flip in her chest at the sights and sounds of Agatha Harkness absolutely losing her shit. Damn, she was cute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then her eyes shifted to the left, where Dulce was sitting, staring at her in that unblinking way she sometimes stared. It unnerved Rio every single time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight was no different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Especially since this time she looked…angry.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grimaced internally as she moved on with her set, ignoring her sister’s piercing stares that followed her throughout the rest of her show.</span>

<b>Chapter Ten</b>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce Vidal didn’t have many adults she could look up to in her childhood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have aunts or uncles. She didn’t have grandparents. Her parents’ friends typically only came around after she’d already been tucked in for the night (by Rio, of course), so she didn’t really get to know any of them well enough to have reasonable role models. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that she thought a bunch of childless adults who acted closer to somebody </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> age were what one might think when the phrase ‘role model’ was being used. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to give her other role models to look up to: scientists, like Einstein and Curie; artists, like Van Gogh and O’Keefe and Rembrandt; and successful businesswomen, like Oprah and Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw. She also introduced Dulce to different genres of music, books, and movies. They vegged out on the couch on weekends to watch old black and white films, and Dulce cuddled up to Rio’s side while she read aloud from picture books, then later helped Dulce learn to read using those same books.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She put on Selena songs while they cooked dinner, dancing around the kitchen as they giggled and sang in Spanish, which Rio taught Dulce all by herself since her parents didn’t seem to have much of an interest in their children outside the odd day when her mother remembered she had them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their father barely acknowledged their existence even when he </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce didn’t have many adults in her life to look up to, but she at least had Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio agreed never to keep things from her – not if she could help it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So why had she kept </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> from her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was sitting next to her right now, trying desperately to suppress her snorts with her hands as Rio told some joke about seeing </span>
<em>
<span>Great Tits</span>
</em>
<span> at Agatha Harkness’s art gallery. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness, who was one of the successful women that Dulce actually looked up to. One she had the luck to live in the same town as. One that Rio </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> she loved (in a purely aspirational sense, of course) because Agatha wasn’t much older than herself and already had a successful career as not only an artist but as a gallery owner, as well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was practically Dulce’s </span>
<em>
<span>Taylor Swift</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So why did Rio never mention the fact that, apparently, the two of them were friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at her sister, unblinkingly, for the entirety of her set. She didn’t take out her phone to film like she normally would have. She just stared. She knew that it unnerved Rio when she did this, but, in her defense, she only did it when she was very, </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> mad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was very much an understatement right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Until the joke about the tits and the boobies and the hooters (oh my!), Dulce was willing to believe that it was </span>
<em>
<span>Alice</span>
</em>
<span> who had formally introduced them after somehow meeting her date (Jennifer fucking </span>
<em>
<span>Kale</span>
</em>
<span>, who was </span>
<em>
<span>also</span>
</em>
<span> a big deal in the suburban New Jersey art world, by the way) in the wild, but that wouldn’t explain why Rio had gone to the art gallery </span>
<em>
<span>without her</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t even </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> into art. It was Dulce who’d dragged her through the exhibits, cooing over compositions and geeking out over light exposure. Rio liked some of the pieces well enough to spend money on prints and creative keychains in the gift shop, but she didn’t typically peruse the art gallery by </span>
<em>
<span>herself</span>
</em>
<span>. Dulce was always with her for that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, at least Dulce had </span>
<em>
<span>thought</span>
</em>
<span> that. Until now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She narrowed her eyes as she caught Rio’s gaze and didn’t miss the thick swallowing motion as Rio quickly averted it, standing once more to pace the stage as she continued her set, moving on from the art gallery to something about the park and nature and whatever-the-fuck. People were still laughing, but Dulce didn’t find this funny anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>How the fuck did they meet?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Westview was a small town, this was true. It’s possible that Rio had met Agatha somewhere mundane, like the cafe or the park or–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce’s eyes widened. </span>
<em>
<span>The park</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The cute runner in the park was Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>freaking</span>
</em>
<span> Harkness! It </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> to be!</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then why would Rio keep that from her? Did she think Dulce was going to start </span>
<em>
<span>stalking</span>
</em>
<span> her or something?!?! She wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> obsessed!</span>
</p><p>
<span>…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, no, Dulce probably would have spent more time in the park just to get a glimpse of Agatha Harkness and possibly become her best friend and potential future business partner – but that was just networking! It was </span>
<em>
<span>smart</span>
</em>
<span>! Rio understood that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t she?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had never given Dulce a reason not to trust her. In fact, she’d given Dulce about a million reasons </span>
<em>
<span>to</span>
</em>
<span> trust her over anybody else. It would have taken a </span>
<em>
<span>major</span>
</em>
<span> betrayal to get Dulce even halfway on somebody else’s side over her own sister’s. Even then, she didn’t think she could really hold a grudge against the woman who literally changed her diapers when she was just starting adolescence. She wasn’t like a typical teen parent in which she actively </span>
<em>
<span>chose</span>
</em>
<span> to be dumb and have unprotected sex – Rio didn’t birth Dulce! She didn’t really </span>
<em>
<span>need</span>
</em>
<span> to raise her like she did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That alone earned her, at least in Dulce’s eyes, the benefit of the doubt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just couldn’t figure out why, then, Rio had kept something so big from her. She knew that Rio would find a way to explain it. She believed that Rio would tell her the truth about it, too. Wouldn’t she?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something rumbled in her chest at the thought. Something uncomfortable. Something like </span>
<em>
<span>doubt</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She did not like it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s set ended, like many do, with a standing ovation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” she said, still perched on her stool, her leg feeling staticky and useless, “that’s so rude of you all, thank you.” There was laughter along with harder applause. Rio laughed with them and waved, forcing herself to her feet. “Thank you all so much for coming!” she said. “Remember to tip your waitresses and close out your tabs. Or don’t! Stay for a while and help fund Morgan Stark’s college education! See you next time!” She blew a kiss as the curtains closed on her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she was no longer in the spotlight, her entire body slumped back onto the stool in exhaustion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had stood up too many times for somebody who called herself the ‘sit-down’ comedian. But Dulce’s stare had really gotten into her head. Every time she looked over at the kid, she seemed to be staring into her very </span>
<em>
<span>soul</span>
</em>
<span>, her eyes narrowing minutely every single time. It was just as unnerving as when she was little, looking like the girl from </span>
<em>
<span>The Ring</span>
</em>
<span> with her long black hair and pale skin (Dulce was </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> an outdoor child). </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt, several times, like jumping off the stage and kneeling at her feet, like explaining to her what had happened, how she and Alice had met Agatha and Jen, and why she’d been unable to tell her about it. But she’d been trapped onstage, doing the same show she’d done for…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>God</span>
</em>
<span>, she didn’t even really know when she’d started doing this show now. It must have been at least three years. Tony had bought the place for Morgan and she was about to be nineteen, just starting her freshman year of college while still living at home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She came out as a teenager, a young one. Was she fourteen or fifteen when she first came out?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. What the fuck did that matter right now? Point is, Rio couldn’t have disrupted the show to grovel at her sister’s feet because that shit </span>
<em>
<span>wasn’t funny!</span>
</em>
<span> She had destroyed her sister’s trust! She doubted that she’d be able to regain it back even if she </span>
<em>
<span>could</span>
</em>
<span> tell Dulce the truth right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned, rubbing her face with her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” a voice said, making Rio yelp, “explain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Jesus Christ!</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio exclaimed, fighting to stay on the stool. Dulce was standing there, shadowed by the mellow lighting of the stage now that there were no spotlights on them. “You need a bell around your neck,” she huffed. “You’ve been spending too much time with Reaper.” Their cat liked to creep around and attack their ankles like she was hunting them. It was part of the reason she often wore a bell on her collar, though she was adept at slipping out of it, so she could play her little stalking game.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Swan’s steps were too heavy to stalk prey. She preferred to wail at her food bowl for her meat like the mustachioed princess she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t deflect,” Dulce said, her voice firm. “Explain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Explain what, exactly?” Rio asked, grimacing even as the question escaped her lips. She was nearly a full half-foot taller than her sister, even sitting on the stool, but Rio found her shoulders hunching as Dulce took a step closer to her, that look in her unblinking eyes intensifying. “Okay, okay,” she squeaked, holding her hands up in surrender. “What do you want to know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you two </span>
<em>
<span>meet</span>
</em>
<span>?” Dulce demanded, folding her arms over her chest. “Let’s start there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We…can’t start there, actually,” Rio said, practically a turtle with how far her head was in between her shoulders. “Not without Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Dulce asked, furrowing her brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It will make sense,” Rio promised. “Eventually. But why are we wasting time </span>
<em>
<span>here</span>
</em>
<span> when we could be </span>
<em>
<span>out there</span>
</em>
<span>, talking to your heroes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce scoffed. “They’re </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> my heroes,” she huffed, but she was blushing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t lie,” Rio teased, standing up and placing one hand on her sister’s back, ushering her out while her cane kept her steady in the other hand. “I’ve seen the newspaper clippings in your bedroom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>What?!</span>
</em>
<span>” Dulce practically choked as Rio led her down the steps and out the side door into the audience. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice, Jen, and Agatha were standing there with a handful of others who wanted Rio’s autograph. It happened at a few shows every now and then since Dulce was regularly posting her on TikTok. Some fans from out of town would find where she does her shows (they never posted their location since they didn’t want the bar to become overrun with lesbian fangirls) and come out in support. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily, these fans never shared the name and location of the bar, either. Rio knew that couldn’t really last.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, there,” she said, grinning at a handful of twenty-somethings with printed out screengrabs of her videos. Rio ushered them forward, taking a sharpie that somebody offered to her as she started to sign the shots from her latest videos. “Thanks so much for coming out,” she would say with a wink to every fan. She also took a couple of selfies and flipped off the camera on request before giving them a wave goodbye as they giggled and shuffled away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Agatha said, “you’re pretty popular, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, blushing, and scratched the back of her neck. “A little bit,” she said. “Like maybe a T-list celebrity. S-list if we’re being generous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have a few hundred thousand followers on Tiktok,” Dulce said, proudly. “Only about twenty of those thousand are bots, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen let out a low whistle. “Impressive,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio saw the stars appear in her sister’s eyes immediately, a flush spreading over her entire face. She would tease her about that later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are you doing, by the way?” Jen asked, leaning around Alice. “Been taking more photos?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course!” Dulce said, smiling bashfully. “I’m actually working on a series of rooftops shots around Westview. I’m trying to stitch together a skyline, actually, but there’s really not that many tall buildings in town for what I’m attempting to do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which is what, exactly?” Agatha asked, seeming genuinely interested.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce was practically vibrating with excitement as she explained her project, which was originally going to be a panorama of the Westview skyline from one end of the town to the other, but it ended up turning into a stitch the same shot at different hours of the day from one singular rooftop (the tallest resident building in downtown Westview, which was only about six stories high) and how she was attempting to get 24 shots of that to put together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously, spending twenty-four hours on a rooftop isn’t really that easy,” Dulce said, blushing and shrugging, “and I haven’t really been able to get a consistent enough shot for it to work as seamlessly as I’d hoped, but maybe if I choose a different location…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Jen said. “No way. That’s a brilliant plan. That’s also </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> building you’re talking about.” She narrowed her gaze at Dulce. “Wait, how did you get rooftop access?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce’s eyes widened and her face blanched. “Uhhhh….”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This girl got her Masters before she could legally drink, ladies and gentleman,” Rio said. Dulce glared and sent an elbow </span>
<em>
<span>directly</span>
</em>
<span> into her ribs at that. “Jeez!” Rio wheezed. Dulce had really put her </span>
<em>
<span>soul</span>
</em>
<span> into that one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was definitely still miffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Dulce said, looking between Agatha, Jen, and Rio, still semi-glaring at the latter, “how did you all meet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha and I met in college,” Jen said. “We had a chem class together. I double-majored so I ended up helping her and then we…” she shrugged, “eh, I </span>
<em>
<span>guess</span>
</em>
<span> you could say we become somewhat ‘friends’.” She used air quotes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a bitch,” Agatha huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Love you,” Jen replied, cheerily as she held up both middle fingers. “We went into business after grad school. Well, actually, I got my PhD and </span>
<em>
<span>then</span>
</em>
<span> we went into business together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, was that hard?” Dulce asked. “I’ve been thinking about getting my PhD.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio asked, furrowing her brow. “You never told </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span> that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess we don’t tell each other everything, then, do we?” Dulce replied, coolly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, ouch. Rio deserved that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Alice both shot her questioning glances, but Jen didn’t seem to recognize the barb in Dulce’s response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’d get one in photography?” she asked Dulce.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce nodded. “I love taking photos, but I’m also super into photo-journalism and nature photography,” she explained. Both of these things Rio knew, though Dulce hadn’t really been focusing on them a lot as of late. Not that Rio was aware of, anyway. “I already have my Master’s, so I could probably do something with that, but there’s a certain level of </span>
<em>
<span>prestige</span>
</em>
<span> in being a </span>
<em>
<span>Doctor</span>
</em>
<span>, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Girl, do I,” Jen laughed. “It might be worthwhile. You could even be on a research team while pursuing it. I know the head of the department at my alma mater, and I could probably get you in touch with her if you’re really serious about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce’s eyes nearly plopped out of her head, they went so wide. “Seriously?” she asked, her hands clasping together like a tiny child who had just been promised all the candy she could eat in her lifetime. “That would be </span>
<em>
<span>amazing</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, you’d still obviously have to put in the work,” Jen said, “but I’m sure that’s not a problem for you. I mean, you did break into my building, for which I pay my HOA </span>
<em>
<span>handsomely</span>
</em>
<span> to keep secure. How did you even do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t break into the building,” Dulce said. “Just onto the roof. The Starks live there, too. I just asked for Morgan’s help.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She motioned to Tony and Morgan behind the bar, the latter of which must have already been looking their way because she looked like a deer caught in headlights. She waved and gave them – especially Dulce – a shy, brace-filled smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, well how did </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> gain roof access?” Jen asked, offering the teen a wave back. “Because nobody’s supposed to be able to get up there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Dulce said, “but I took a blood oath never to tell anybody the how.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>What</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio asked, frowning at her. Dulce avoided her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen just nodded, sagely. “Respect,” she said. “If she can do it again, though, you can stay at my place for the twenty-four hours you’d need to get your shot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously?” Dulce asked, her voice breathy. “You…you’d let me do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen shrugged. “You’re not a serial killer, right?” She eyed Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How am I supposed to know what this girl gets up to when she’s out of my sight? I’m not her keeper…anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce rolled her eyes. “I’m not a serial killer,” Dulce promised, holding her hand up like a scout, three fingers raised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was never a scout.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> a serial killer?” she asked Jen, narrowing her eyes almost playfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I sure hope not,” Alice said from behind Jen’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen offered her an affectionate smile, turning to wrap her arm around Alice’s waist. “I’m not a serial killer,” she cooed, “but I bet I could make you scream.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat of silence in which Alice’s face turned bright red before the rest of the group let out groans of disgust, Agatha shoving Jen with a huff as she snickered, her attention still on Alice, who seemed to be completely malfunctioning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“On that note,” Agatha said, “why don’t you two scram and go finish the rest of your date before you make the rest of us barf? I’m gonna grab a drink.” She turned to Rio. “What would you like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I already have a tab open,” Rio said. “You can put it–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope,” Agatha said. “No way. </span>
<em>
<span>I’m</span>
</em>
<span> paying this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>This</span>
</em>
<span> time?” Dulce asked, and Rio could hear the edge to her voice as she looked between them. Alice had already started tugging Jen toward the exit without so much as a goodbye. (Good for her, to be honest.) “When was the </span>
<em>
<span>last</span>
</em>
<span> time you went out for drinks?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She bought me coffee yesterday,” Agatha explained before Rio could even open her mouth, “against my will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s dramatic,” Rio huffed. “I was just quicker at paying. And it was </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> cheaper than anything you could get here, by the way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still,” Agatha said. “It’s </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> treat this time. Dulce, that goes for you, too, dear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked when Dulce’s cheeks darkened in another blush and she cleared her throat. “Thank you, Miss Harkness,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hon,” Agatha said, a slightly warning tone to her voice as she looked at Dulce.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry!” Dulce said, holding her hands up in surrender. She cleared her throat. “Agatha,” she corrected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snickered under her breath and dodged Dulce’s elbow: she learned her lesson there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Dulce said, once they were seated at a table by the bar, “how, exactly, did you two meet?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had some fruity drink that looked like liquid cotton candy with a silly straw and reminded Rio of the Friendly’s they used to drive thirty minutes out of their way for on special occasions, like birthdays and graduations and days ending in Y. Agatha had a glass of Merlot, and Rio just had a Stella Artois. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Rio at the question, halfway through her first sip of wine. Rio looked back, pressing her lips to the lip of the bottle and taking a shallow sip. Dulce glanced between them like she was watching a silent tennis match.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” she asked. “Did you meet at a sex club or something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio choked on her tiny sip of beer and she could swear some wine came out of Agatha’s nose when she snorted out a shocked laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>What</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha said. “Where on </span>
<em>
<span>earth</span>
</em>
<span>…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, why else would you be hesitating this much?!” Dulce huffed, throwing her hands up. “I just want straight answers here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, honey,” Agatha said, reaching out to pat her hand, “if you want straight answers, ask a straight lady.” She winked at Dulce, who flushed and took a sip of her cotton candy monstrosity, which almost certainly had way more sugar than alcohol in it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her lips together, ducking her head a little at the smile and wink Agatha shot her way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t tell her?” Agatha asked, after she’d finished dabbing the wine from her lips. Rio shook her head. “Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not my place to tell your business,” Agatha admitted, giving Dulce an apologetic smile. “Sorry, Duls.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that’s considerate of you,” Agatha said, giving Rio a warm smile. “But it’s really not necessary. I’m not ashamed of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ashamed of what?” Dulce asked. “Did something happen?” She was looking only at Agatha now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “I was diagnosed,” she said, her words slow and a little drawn-out, her hand tensing around the stemless wine glass she held just slightly, “with…MS. Rio and I met at our MS group.” She took a deep breath and another sip. Under the table, Rio’s foot brushed hers and Agatha glanced at her as she sipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Dulce said, her shoulders relaxing a little bit as she looked between Agatha and Rio, her expression softening as she regarded her sister. Rio gave her a tight-lipped smile. “Oh, wow,” she said. “That really sucks. I…I had no idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, how could you have any idea?” Agatha asked with a slight chuckle. “</span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> didn’t even have any idea. I wouldn’t have, either, had it not been for the fact that my left hand went numb last year and left me unable to paint. Temporarily,” she hastened to add when Dulce’s eyes went wide and her mouth gaped slightly. “I regained feeling before I even saw the neurologist. I thought it was just a side effect from a flu shot.” She shrugged. “I was wrong, of course. I know that now.” She looked down into the nearly empty glass. Rio reached over to place her hand on Agatha’s arm, and Agatha jumped slightly at the action. Rio was about to remove her hand, but found Agatha’s fingers wrapped around hers before she could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She met her bright blue gaze with her own and they shared a long look before Agatha let go and drained the rest of her glass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to get another,” she said. “Anybody else want something while I’m gone?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, thanks,” Rio said, holding up her half-full beer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m okay,” Dulce said. Most of her drink was still there. The straw made consumption slow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha said. “I’m gonna close out so this is your last chance.” She stood next to the table, eyeing each of them in turn, giving them one last chance to place their order.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should actually go pretty soon,” Dulce said. “I have an early shift. I’m just gonna finish this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eat something when you get home,” Rio said, “before you fall asleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Duh,” Dulce huffed, rolling her eyes like a petulant teenager. But she was also grinning affectionately. Rio mirrored her smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Brat,” she said as Agatha stepped away from the table. She leaned in. “Do you understand now,” she asked, “why I couldn’t say anything?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Dulce sighed. “I get it.” She eyed Agatha as she signed the receipt and laughed at something Morgan was saying. “So, you guys met at group?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio confirmed. “On Monday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You only </span>
<em>
<span>just</span>
</em>
<span> met on </span>
<em>
<span>Monday</span>
</em>
<span>?” Dulce hissed. “I thought you’d been keeping this secret from me for at </span>
<em>
<span>least</span>
</em>
<span>, like, a </span>
<em>
<span>month</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span>!” Rio scoffed. “I mean, I absolutely </span>
<em>
<span>would</span>
</em>
<span> if Agatha wanted me to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I see,” Dulce said, with a knowing smirk, “you’re smitten.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio coughed up half her sip of beer at that, reaching for napkins to hastily wipe her face. “What?” she wheezed. “I am </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, you </span>
<em>
<span>totally</span>
</em>
<span> are,” Dulce said. “Don’t try to deny it. She’s the girl in the park, isn’t she?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened at that, her jaw dropping as Dulce took another sip of her drink through that </span>
<em>
<span>ridiculous</span>
</em>
<span> silly straw, her lips curved up in a knowing smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about the park?” Agatha asked, setting her glass down before perching on her own stool at the high-top table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I might take a walk through it tomorrow,” Dulce said, “on my lunch break. Maybe I’ll go visit my floral niblings. Rio loves them more than she does me, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re my babies,” Rio said, unapologetically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, if we were all trapped in a burning building, you’d save them over me?” Dulce gasped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not fair,” Rio whined. “They don’t have legs! Besides, </span>
<em>
<span>I’m</span>
</em>
<span> the one that walks with a cane. I’d be relying on </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> to save </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Touché,” Dulce said, tipping her mostly empty glass at Rio. “Anyway, I think I’m gonna head out. Thank you for the drink, Mis–ahem, </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>. It was nice to see you again, though I’m sure I’ll be seeing more of you now that you and my sister are,” she eyed Rio, “friends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squinted at that pause, but she said nothing as she took another sip of her wine. Meanwhile, Dulce stood and brought her mostly empty glass to the bar. Rio watched with a smirk as Morgan shoved her dad away and smiled brightly as Dulce approached. The girls said something to each other and laughed before Dulce gave Morgan a little wave and headed to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head as Morgan gazed at her sister’s retreating form, her smile a little dazed. Tony stepped back up next to her and poked her in the side, murmuring something in her ear that made her turn and shove him in response. He just laughed, wrapping his arms around her and pressing a kiss to her forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, your sister is kind of intense, huh?” Agatha asked, after a moment of silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio chuckled. “It’s the Vidal family trait, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> intense,” Agatha snorted. “I don’t think she blinked </span>
<em>
<span>once</span>
</em>
<span> your entire show.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, yeah,” Rio said, smiling bashfully, “uh…about that. She does that when she’s pissed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha furrowed her brow. “Pissed? Like angry?” Rio nodded, taking a sip of her now-lukewarm beer. What did she have to be angry about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The fact that I didn’t tell her that you and I, uh,” Rio swallowed thickly, “met. I mean, like, that we were sorta hanging out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.” Agatha tilted her head. “Why, exactly, would she care about that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you’re, like, her role model,” Rio said, knowing that if Dulce was there, she’d strangle her with a beer hose. “She really looks up to you, you know, for being a business owner and a successful artist.” She drained the last dregs of her beer. “Don’t ever tell her I told you that or you’ll never find my body.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you mean they’ll never find </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> body?” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio said, gravely serious. “Dulce would </span>
<em>
<span>decimate</span>
</em>
<span> me if she found out I said those words to you. There probably wouldn’t even be a body </span>
<em>
<span>to find</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t laugh at that, but she did smirk into her next sip of wine, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She seems like a great kid,” Agatha said. “Funny and charming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And intense?” Rio chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, those things aren’t mutually exclusive, it would seem,” Agatha said, her voice a little low, warm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her insides go equally warm, and she began to play with the label on her beer, peeling it off easily with the help of the condensation. Honestly, she didn’t really know what else to say to that: she wasn’t all that great at talking about herself, except briefly or in front of an audience, for a laugh, but to talk about Dulce?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d never made jokes about her sister or spoke about her when she wasn’t around to interject. It made Rio feel uncomfortable. That may have honestly been because the only time she spoke about Dulce growing up was to her teachers (who always gushed about how smart and creative she was) or her teachers (who complained that Dulce didn’t treat them with the respect they think they </span>
<em>
<span>deserved</span>
</em>
<span> just for being the people who supplied their genetic material to her despite pawning her off on their eldest to raise her). </span>
</p><p>
<span>She liked to brag about her sometimes, but those conversations could get tiresome. And tonight wasn’t about bragging about her genius little sister. Tonight was about </span>
<em>
<span>them</span>
</em>
<span>. Her and Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Is there even a you and Agatha?</span>
</em>
<span> that asshole voice inside her head asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced back up at the other woman and found Agatha already looking at her, her head tilted. Her smirk, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio asked, her cheeks going hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged and shook her head. “Nothing,” she said. “I just…I don’t think I’ve ever seen you stay quiet for this long.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You calling me a blabbermouth, Harkness?” Rio shot back, giving her an easy grin in return. “I talk too much?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not at all,” Agatha laughed. The sound was throaty and light. That second glass of wine had really loosened her up. She probably wasn’t drunk though. Just buzzed. But a little bit more unguarded than usual. “I actually like it,” Agatha admitted, “when you lecture about certain subjects. Have you ever thought about being a professor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like, at a college?” Rio asked, lifting a brow. “What would I even teach?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you have a Master’s in botany?” Agatha asked, tipping her empty glass toward Rio. “Couldn’t you teach that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Probably,” he said. “Most universities are looking for people with PhDs, though. I’d probably be an adjunct, at best.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That could be fun,” Agatha said. “I’m sure your students would </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span> you and your lectures.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really think so?” Rio asked, feeling something flutter in her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have a natural stage presence and knowledge of not only botany, but a great deal of other things. You’ve taught me more about chocolate than I ever knew there was to know,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They both laughed that time, their chuckles mingling almost musically to Rio’s ears. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess you might have a point,” she said. “You know, </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> could also be a professor. You have a Master’s, too, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Two, technically,” Agatha said, a bit bashfully. “I primarily wanted a degree in art history, but I’d double-majored in business in my undergrad, so I figured why not do the same at grad school.” She shuddered. “Horrible experience. Would not reccommend. Those two years were </span>
<em>
<span>hell</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Need another glass?” Rio said, standing up, motioning to her wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said, shaking her head. “No, I shouldn’t. I still haven’t even eaten dinner, actually. This is just gonna go straight through me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanna grab a slice next door?” Rio asked, nodding toward the door. “Best pizza in Westview.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a high bar,” Agatha retorted, dryly, rolling her eyes with a snort. “Um, sure, I guess. Not like I can really drive home right now, anyway. Let me just…” She held up her cup. Rio nodded, grabbing her cane as Agatha walked the glass back over to the bar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Morgan Stark took it from her with a bright smile. That kid was like pure sunshine where her father was typically the silent, surly type. Oh, Tony Stark could be charming when he wanted to be, but he was nowhere near the level of sunny disposition of his daughter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed at something Morgan said before giving her a little wave and walked over to meet Rio halfway to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held out her arm as Rio got closer. “M’lady,” she said with a little bow, her other had clutching her cane to keep her upright. Her legs were really starting to feel the exhuastion from all the times she’d forced herself to walk around tonight. Damn Dulce and her unblinking eyes. She tried not to let it show as Agatha took the offered arm like a lady in the Regency era, ducking her head a little so that her dark curls hid her face slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could still see her smile and that blush, though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Damn, she was beautiful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, it didn’t take much walking to get them to </span>
<em>
<span>Pizz-a-Westview</span>
</em>
<span> (pronounced “Piece of Westview” though there were many who called it “Piss a Westview. Rio may or may not have been included in this ‘many’) and Rio was able to take a seat close to the door, sweating slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you okay?” Agatha asked, her brows furrowing in concern as she looked down at Rio, who was rubbing her left thigh, attempting to get the feeling back in her leg. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Rio assured her. “I just…um, there’s a reason I’m called the sit-down comedian, you know?” She took a deep, shuddering breath as she stretched her legs out under the table. “I should be fine in a minute or two, but I really gave my muscles a workout that my nerves can’t exactly keep up with. But I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked like she wanted to ask another “are you sure” but she only pressed her lips together and nodded again, taking the seat across from Rio just as a teen girl appeared next to the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Miss Rio,” the girl greeted, giving Rio a dap as she placed a menu on the table, pointedly just sliding it toward Agatha. “How was your set tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I did pretty well,” Rio said. “Agatha here seemed to like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl, whose nametag read ‘Shuri’ turned to look at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “It was okay,” she said, but Rio could see the mischievous twinkle in her eyes. Still, she acted hurt, placing her hand on her chest as if wounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Et tu, Agaté?” she said, dramatically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shuri snorted while Agatha rolled her eyes and plucked up the menu. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The usual tonight, Miss Rio?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, please,” Rio said. “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you, Miss…Agatha, was it? You need another moment with the menu?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just Agatha is fine, dear,” Agatha said. “Are these personal pizzas?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Shuri answered. “They’re about the size of a frisbee. We can also prepare a Medium for you to share or I can give you one of our pre-made slices from the back of the menu. Everything is available right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned the menu over, her crystal blue eyes perusing it for a long moment before landing on something she seemed to like. She glanced up at Rio before leaning toward Shuri to show her what she wanted. Shuri nodded, sagely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good choice,” she said, taking the menu. “Anything to drink?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Again, she was only looking at Agatha: she knew what Rio liked to drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced behind the clear display case at the register, which showed off all the different pre-made pizzas, and through to where there was a soda fountain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coke?” she asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coming right up,” Shuri said, turning on her heel to make her way to the back of the pizza shop, where there were already several women rolling dough in flour or topping the various sizes of pizza or answering the phones, which rang off the hook on Saturday nights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve never seen so many women working at a pizza place,” Agatha murmured. “Usually, it’s a bunch of sweaty, hairy men.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ramonda has an all-female staff,” Rio informed her. “That’s Shuri’s mother. She’s the owner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She named this place?” Agatha asked, glancing at the neon sign on the window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a laugh, shaking her head. “No way,” she said. “Her husband named it.” She frowned as her chest tightened. “He passed last year. They didn’t have the heart to rename it. For as much shit as he got from the local teens over the name, T’Chaka was proud of his shop and the name that made his children giggle when they first moved here from Wakanda. Ramonda didn’t have the heart to change it after his passing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, solemnly. “It’s a good name,” she said. “Very much like what I’d imagine a father would name his pizza place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Their son, T’Challa, is at university right now, but he usually runs it right alonside his mother. He’s in school for business, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And how old is Shuri?” Agatha whispered, leaning in. “Isn’t it a little late for her to be working?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s sixteen,” Rio whispered back, “and it’s only a quarter to eleven. Since it’s Saturday, she can work until midnight tonight. Besides, she’s already graduated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s only sixteen and she’s already graduated high school?” Agatha asked. She pressed her lips together when Shuri came back, placing a Coke in front of her and a Sprite in front of Rio. Agatha offered her a thankful smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio saluted her with her glass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she was out of earshot, she gave Agatha a grin. “Shuri has her Bachelor’s in Engineering, actually,” she said. “She’s taking a gap year before grad school to relax.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened at that. “Why do you surround yourself with such intelligent toddlers?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re good company,” Rio replied with a grin. “Shuri and Dulce met while Duls was doing her final year of grad school. “She was only thirteen back then. Dulce kind of took Shuri under her wing. They had </span>
<em>
<span>completely</span>
</em>
<span> different majors, obviously, but Dulce knew what it was like to be the </span>
<em>
<span>little kid</span>
</em>
<span> amongst the bigger ones. She wanted to protect Shuri from a lot of the mistakes she’d made her freshman and sophomore year (for Shuri, this was pretty much the same year of school because the girl is a </span>
<em>
<span>super</span>
</em>
<span>genius).”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aww,” Agatha said. “That’s sweet. What is </span>
<em>
<span>in</span>
</em>
<span> the drinking water in Westview? And why didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> get any of it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it’s the pizza that made Shuri so smart. Wait until you try it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Order up!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>As if on cue, Shuri appeared with a tray of two personal pizzas. She placed a pepperoni and sausage down in front of Rio. “Your regular, madam,” she said, presenting it with a bow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mercí,” Rio replied, rubbing her hands together as she licked her lips, hungrily. Her stomach was growling like a lion. She never ate before shows because she didn’t want anything to upset her stomach if she got nervous. It would be </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> too embarrassing to have to run off to use the bathroom in the middle of a set. </span>
<em>
<span>Sure</span>
</em>
<span>, she could make it into a funny bit, but that bit would get old way too fast if she took a long time indisposed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Better to not risk it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Usually, she would have a hot burger waiting for her, courtesy of the Starks, after the show, but she’d asked them to forgo it tonight. She knew, somehow, that she and Agatha would end up here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just didn’t know that it would take so long. Now she was </span>
<em>
<span>famished</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And for Miss Agatha,” Shuri said–</span>
</p><p>
<span>–“Agatha” Agatha interjected. Shuri ignored her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A Hawaiian pizza,” Shuri finished, placing the ham and pineapple </span>
<em>
<span>monstrosity</span>
</em>
<span> down in front of Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your betrayal keeps getting </span>
<em>
<span>deeper</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio gasped, recoiling from the woman behind her in mock – no, very, very </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span> – horror. “How </span>
<em>
<span>could</span>
</em>
<span> you? And in </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>safe space, of all places!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha huffed, trying and failing to bite back a grin as she looked down at her abomination before God, “I like ham, I like pineapple, and I like pizza. Why not combine all three? It just seems more convenient.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s an affront to </span>
<em>
<span>God</span>
</em>
<span> and all </span>
<em>
<span>decency</span>
</em>
<span>!” Rio huffed. “Right, Shuri?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother says I am not allowed to give my personal opinion in any way that might lose us business,” Shuri said, folding her arms behind her back like the dutiful daughter that she was. “But I will say that I do believe karma is real and it will come for you soon, Miss Agatha. Enjoy your pizzas! Let me know if you need anything else!”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, she was off to cater to the few other tables that had seated themselves since Agatha and Rio’s arrival. Rio just shook her head at Agatha as she took the first slice of her atrocious pizza and brought it to her mouth, blowing slightly to cool it off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She used to joke with Alice about what it would take for a crush to die. Most women she’d had a crush on could do just about anything to her and she would thank them. There were only really three things one could do that would be a dealbreaker for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Number one was to be rude to waitstaff or customer service workers in general. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could not </span>
<em>
<span>stand</span>
</em>
<span> people who were rude to the workers at any store for pretty much any reason. She had scooped ice cream in high school. Her sister was a barista. They had worked </span>
<em>
<span>hard</span>
</em>
<span> at their jobs to make minimum wage, but they’d both had people scream in their faces about things they literally could not control. They’d also had people make little digs at them and undervalue them for the positions they held. In Rio’s opinion, that was just as bad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All three times Rio had seen Agatha interact with somebody in a position of service in just the last couple of days, she had proven herself to be a kind and decent person, especially to the younger workers, like Shuri and Kamala. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Score one for Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second was to be rude or unkind to her sister.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce was sweet and kind and bubbly and energetic. She could be </span>
<em>
<span>a lot</span>
</em>
<span> sometimes, especially when she was a little kid. Rio would – and </span>
<em>
<span>has</span>
</em>
<span> – cut off anybody who couldn’t deal with that energy. Friends, girlfriends…it didn’t matter. Dulce was her number one. Forever. She didn’t let snide remarks or backhanded compliments slide off her back. She’d once left a date because the girl had called her sister ‘too much’ after Dulce had made her a drawing of the three of them from the park a week earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Who says that about a little kid’s drawing? That shit is adorable!</span>
</em>
<span> Rio had exclaimed, recounting the story to Alice years later. She was still very much mad about it, and how the girl had laughed when Rio had warned her not to say shit like that in front of her, like she thought it was a joke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had very much not been joking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had been nothing but nice to Dulce since the moment they met (Dulce would not shut </span>
<em>
<span>up</span>
</em>
<span> about </span>
<em>
<span>how nice Agatha Harkness is</span>
</em>
<span> after her showcase), and it was obvious that she had affection for the younger artist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Score two for Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The third was Hawaiian Pizza.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had gotten into heated </span>
<em>
<span>debates</span>
</em>
<span> in high school over this very subject. Hawaiian Pizza wasn’t even </span>
<em>
<span>Hawaiian</span>
</em>
<span>! It was invented in </span>
<em>
<span>Canada</span>
</em>
<span>! They had no right to slap pineapple on a pizza and then ascribe it to a people who had absolutely </span>
<em>
<span>nothing to do </span>
</em>
<span>with the ruination of two of Rio’s favorite things (pineapple itself was fine, and she obviously loved pizza). It was like slapping some plantains on a plate of spaghetti and calling it </span>
<em>
<span>Puerto Rican Lasagna</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She did not like it. In high school, she had tried to get a petition going that straight up </span>
<em>
<span>banned</span>
</em>
<span> it from Westview in its entirety. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Obviously, it did not work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio had always maintained that anybody who actively chose to partake in the grotesque oddity that was “Hawaiian” pizza was </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> to be trusted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Until now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha Harkness looked absolutely </span>
<em>
<span>adorable</span>
</em>
<span> munching on her pizza. She was making happy noises as she popped pieces of pineapple straight from the sea of cheese and into her mouth, waggling her head like there was a jaunty little tune playing in her mind as she ate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Usually, seeing somebody enjoy </span>
<em>
<span>Satan’s Birthday Cake</span>
</em>
<span> like that would have sent her on a tirade, but there was something about Agatha’s joy at her </span>
<em>
<span>absolutely revolting</span>
</em>
<span> little treat that was actively charming Rio. She almost wanted to ask for a bite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then she took another look at Agatha’s dish and wrinkled her nose in disgust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No. Not a chance. She’d simply let Agatha enjoy the whole thing all on her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed thickly as she dug into her own pizza, attempting to avert her gaze from Agatha’s so that her mind didn’t drink her into thinking that her pepperoni were little slices of ham or that the chunks of sausage were actually pineapple bits. That was </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> she needed tonight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even if that </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> happen, though, she knew she could never hold it against Agatha. As much and for as long as she had said that liking Hawaiian pizza was a dealbreaker for her, it felt different when the person who liked it was Agatha Harkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned as she took a bite of her pizza.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Damn her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe you’re going to take that abomination home with you,” Rio huffed as Shuri handed Agatha a box for the last few slices of her “pizza”. “You’re really going to warm that thing up tomorrow and make it taste even </span>
<em>
<span>more</span>
</em>
<span> gross?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Actually, I like to eat it cold,” Agatha responded, grinning when Rio let out a little gagging sound. </span>
<em>
<span>Troll</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was doing this on purpose just to get a rise out of Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hated that she didn’t hate it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She put her own remaining three slices into the box. Usually, she could finish a whole personal pizza like this and still have room for dessert, but this time the fluttering in her stomach every time she looked at Agatha made it hard to eat everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It could have also been the nausea that Hawaiian “pizza” induces, as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, maybe she </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> being a bit dramatic about this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She really did think it was the devil, though. She was justified in that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have a nice night!” Shuri said, starting to sweep the floor and wipe down the tables for closing time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t we have to pay?” Agatha asked, furrowing her brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss Rio took care of it, already,” Shuri informed her. “Slipped me her card under the table when I came by for refills.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You little…” Agatha huffed, glaring at Rio, who just grinned and shrugged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was my turn to pay after you bought the drinks,” Rio said. “Fair is fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That beer was, like, six dollars </span>
<em>
<span>max</span>
</em>
<span>!” Agatha exclaimed. “This meal was </span>
<em>
<span>fifteen</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You also bought my little sister a drink,” Rio reminded her. “It was definitely more than ten, so </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> I still owe you a little bit to make us even.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No way,” Agatha said. “I’m buying lobster next time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Next time</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio teased, grabbing her cane and hobbling toward the door with her pizza in her other hand. “A little presumptuous, don’t you think. Especially after making me watch you eat that…</span>
<em>
<span>thing</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you don’t stop, I’ll bring you to a pizza shop that </span>
<em>
<span>only</span>
</em>
<span> serves Hawaiian pizza and won’t let you leave until you’ve had a whole slice of it,” Agatha threatened, rushing ahead of Rio to open the door for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m pretty sure that goes against the Geneva Conventions,” Rio said, walking out onto the street.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Y’all are too much,” Shuri said, laughing behind them as they left. “See you later, Miss Rio! Hope to see you back soon, Miss Agatha!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You too, dear!” Agatha replied, sunnily. She turned to Rio as soon as the door was closed. “You need a ride home?” she asked, reaching for her car keys clipped to her belt loop on a little purple carabiner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t live very far away from here, actually,” Rio said. “I can walk home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Agatha said, pressing a button on the little remote. An orange car about five feet away blinked awake. “Wouldn’t want your leg to give out on you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a bit ableist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It very much is not,”  Agatha laughed, tugging her by the arm to the orange Subaru. “You could barely make it to the pizza shop a couple hours ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I’ve had sustenance since then,” Rio reminded her, holding up her leftover pizza. “I’m sure I’ll be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you even okay to drive?” Rio asked. “You seemed a little tipsy before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m better now,” Agatha said. “Time and pizza helped. I might have a headache in the morning. Just get in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jeez, okay!” Rio laughed, walking around to the passenger side door and slipping into the car. “I really don’t live that far though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So this should be a short trip. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her face go warm at that as Agatha started up the car. She cleared her throat and looked out the window as she pulled away from the curb. Most other cars were gone, the spots taken up only by the few with overnight parking passes to avoid the meters and parking tickets. The street was pretty quiet and empty, even the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It only took a minute to get to Rio’s apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m right here,” she said, pointing to her building, which was, give or take, about two hundred feet from </span>
<em>
<span>The Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re kidding,” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you I live close,” Rio laughed. “You should have listened to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t think you meant ‘</span>
<em>
<span>across the street’</span>
</em>
<span> close!” Agatha exclaimed, but she was also laughing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat there in Agatha’s car for a long time, just laughing at the absurdity of it all. Rio probably could have hobbled to her building faster than it took Agatha to start the car, shift gears, and pull out into the street, but she had done what was asked and humored her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for the ride, anyway,” Rio said, shrugging one shoulder as unbuckled her seatbelt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait,” Agatha said, “let me walk you to your door.” She turned off the engine and put her hazards on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s really not that far, either,” Rio informed her. “I have an ADA-compliant apartment on the first floor. It’s literally fifty feet from the front entrance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I will walk you that fifty feet,” Agatha said, stubbornly. “Let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes fondly as the other woman jumped out before she could protest. “What a gentleman,” she murmured as she slipped out with her cane and her pizza. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She met Agatha on the sidewalk and the two walked toward the entrance of her building, their shoulders brushing as they went. Rio reached for her building fob, waving it in front of the automatic doors.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Agatha commented, “electric doorman.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “More ADA-compliance,” she said. “Makes it easier for people in wheelchairs or walking with aids to smoothly get into the apartment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice,” Agatha said. “When did you move in here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Around the time this happened,” she said, holding up her cane for a second. “But that was just good timing. It can take a really long time for these kinds of apartments to open up. We were already on the waitlist for this building because we had Section 8. I updated them about the change in my needs and they were like ‘dope we have the perfect place for you’ and the rest is history. It’s a pretty cool place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seems cool,” Agatha said as they walked through the lobby, which had mailboxes along one wall, none of them higher that a relatively short person’s eye level. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio led her to the left hallway, where the apartment she shared with Dulce was, literally, the first door on the right, next to the elevator. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is me,” she said, “again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Agatha said. “You weren’t kidding about it only being about fifty feet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fifty feet exactly,” Rio said, grinning. “The landlord told me that the first day, like it was the biggest selling point. Didn’t hurt, to be honest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, biting her lower lip as she turned toward Rio, who was suddenly made nervous by the way Agatha was looking at her and playing with the sleeves of her cardigan. It looked really soft. She wished her hands weren’t full so she could feel the material. It was probably really smooth and cool and…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned into her space, but stopped a few inches from their noses brushing as if restraining herself, her blue eyes searching Rio’s, asking a question that Rio was </span>
<em>
<span>desperate</span>
</em>
<span> to say yes to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could, however, the door opened and they were practically both knocked over by Dulce making a hasty exit from the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oops!” Dulce said. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to– Agatha? What are you doing here?” She glanced over to her sister. Rio could feel her face flaming as she stood, wide-eyed like a robber caught red-handed, holding her leftover pizza. “Rio? What’s going…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce looked between them and her genius brain processed everything she was seeing in milliseconds, her lips upturning in a very “You like Krabby Patties, don’t you, Squidward?” kind of way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio immediately gave her a </span>
<em>
<span>Look</span>
</em>
<span> that said “Do not </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span> with me right now, cockblock” and Dulce raised her hands in surrender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” she said. “I’m just heading out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio asked. “I thought you had a morning shift.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got Tommy to switch with me,” Dulce said. “Morgan’s gonna let me on the roof again and Miss Kale said I can come to her apartment when I need a break…in the afternoon, anyway. She said she’ll be a bit…busy until then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ew,” Agatha and Rio said in unison. Then shared a shy grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dulce looked between them and rolled her eyes. Hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyway,” she said, “</span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> apartment is gonna be empty for the next few hours, though, so…have fun!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she rushed past them without another word, her overnight bag slung over her shoulder, the door to the apartment still half-open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Swan poked her head outside, meowing gruffly up at the two women in the doorway. Reaper was behind her, tilting her head curiously with that permanently smiling face of hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s this?” Agatha asked, smiling as she crouched down in front of the fat cat. She scratched under Swan’s chin, immediately gaining her favor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s Swan,” Rio said, swallowing thickly. “She’s a sweetheart. The other one is Reaper.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Swan,” Agatha echoed. “Reaper.” She glanced at the other cat. “Well, </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> fits,” she said, eyeing the skull-like pattern on Reaper’s face. “But why is this one Swan?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s short for Ron Swanson,” Rio informed her. “He’s a character on this show Dulce and I used to watch, </span>
<em>
<span>Parks and Recreation</span>
</em>
<span>. We just saw her and knew that was her name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s adorable,” Agatha said. “I’ve never seen that show.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously!?” Rio gasped. She’d rarely met somebody who hasn’t seen at least </span>
<em>
<span>part</span>
</em>
<span> of </span>
<em>
<span>Parks and Rec</span>
</em>
<span>. “We </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> to watch it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rain check on that?” Agatha said, standing back up. Her knees didn’t crack or anything, damn runner. “I need to get back out there before my car gets towed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Rio said, her heart swelling with the knowledge that this meant she would </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> see Agatha Harkness again, </span>
<em>
<span>outside </span>
</em>
<span>of group therapy. Again. “It’s a date.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha said, nodding decisively, “it is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood there for another long moment, just staring at each other, smiling like idiots but neither making any move, either toward each other or away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha said, “I’ll, um, text you tomorrow, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio said, clearing her throat as she nudged Swan inside the apartment with her foot. Swan looked up at her with the most scandalized expression, as though Rio had just insulted her entire ancestry. But she went inside like a good girl. Reaper welcomed her with grooming licks to her shattered little ego.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started to move into the apartment, but before she could get too far, she felt Agatha’s hand hook around her elbow, causing her to turn around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She started to ask “what” but no sooner had the first consonant sound left her lips than they were covered by Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss was brief and almost-chaste except for the barest hint of tongue swiping across Rio’s bottom lip. She didn’t even have time to deepen it before Agatha was pulling away, taking several steps until her back hit the opposite wall, her cheeks pink and blue eyes wide, her chest heaving a little bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um,” Agatha said, “thank you for the pizza. I’ll…bye!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she was gone, her steps quick across the lobby to the front door, leaving Rio staring after her, mouth tingling more than her leg.</span>

<strong>Chapter Eleven</strong>
</p><p>Agatha couldn't remember the drive home.</p><p>Everything was fuzzy, blurred, soft at the edges — and it had nothing to do with the two glasses of wine she'd drunk earlier that evening.</p><p>Well, okay, maybe it had <em>something </em>to do with the alcohol that must have still been buzzing in her system. But it had been at least two hours since she'd finished the second glass and she now had her pizza to soak it up in her stomach. Agatha looked down at the box in her left hand. When she left the pizza shop, she'd been full, but now…</p><p>Ugh, she was always weirdly hungry when she was buzzed.</p><p>And when she got stressed.</p><p>She didn't really know which one was causing her hunger now; it was probably a combination of the two.</p><p>She had kissed Rio.</p><p>It barely counted as a kiss, though.</p><p>It was barely the lightest brush of lips.</p><p>And a slight swipe of her tongue over Rio's bottom lip.</p><p>But then she'd pulled away.</p><p>Just as Rio's lips had begun to move against hers.</p><p>That was probably a dumb decision.</p><p>Agatha opened the box and pulled out one of the remaining slices of pizza, bringing it up to her lips as she kicked off her shoes and padded toward the kitchen, where she deposited the box in the fridge. It was best to remove temptation.</p><p>She continued to munch on her mostly-cold pizza as she padded around the first floor of her house. She didn't feel tired enough to go up to bed just yet. Quite the opposite, actually. Her legs felt fuzzy, like an electric current was running through them, but it was too late to go running.</p><p>So there was only one thing to do.</p><p>Agatha's studio was quiet as she stepped inside. Of course it was. It was nearly midnight now. Westview as a whole was asleep, even on a Saturday night.</p><p>The trees just outside her backyard fence swayed in the breeze, creating shadows through the wide windows with the warm streetlights behind them. Agatha watched the shapes move across the room for a moment before she flicked on the lights and walked to the loveseat, slipping her arms from her cardigan and laying it over the back.</p><p>Her easel sat in the center of the room, as always, with a prepped, but blank, canvas waiting for her. She'd set up her paints <em>days</em> ago, certain that she'd find the time to start painting the sketch she'd made a few days ago, which was clipped to the edge of her easel, waiting for her to copy it onto the canvas.</p><p>She'd just left them sitting in their tubes, her pencil resting on the easel, still perfectly sharpened from disuse. Agatha sat down on her stool and began to copy what she'd sketched over a week ago now.</p><p>She worked diligently, occasionally stepping back from the stool to get a wider perspective and make sure that everything was proportionate. The figure of the woman she drew was the hardest part — specifically her hair.</p><p>Agatha didn't know if she should draw her with short hair or long hair. Should it be kept up or left loose, as it had been in her sketch. She started to draw it tied up in an elaborate bun, but that didn't seem to fit. So she erased that and sketched it as it was in the drawing, wild and loose around the figure's shoulders, but there was something <em>off</em> about that, as well.</p><p>Agatha let out a groan of frustration and placed her pencil right back down, feeling silly. It was just <em>hair. </em>What did it matter if it was up or down or tied or loose or…<em>whatever</em>?! It wasn't even the focus of the piece. That was meant to be the sun.</p><p>Or the woman?</p><p>Or the way the water lapped around her shins? Agatha hadn't even realized that she'd made the tide higher on the woman's body than it had been in the sketch. It was inching toward her knees, the beach swallowed up by a high tide.</p><p>Agatha stepped back from the outline of the piece and stared at the woman's head. She hadn't done much for it. It was just meant to be a guide for the hair that was <em>supposed</em> to fall over her shoulders and stick out wildly, like the ocean breeze had tousled it. She drew the faint outline of pierced ears sticking out at either side, with hoops hugging the shells.</p><p>Suddenly, Agatha didn't like the angle of the woman's currently-bald head.</p><p>She erased it and sketched it at a ¾ angle, facing away from the observer, enough to see part of the woman's profile. She drew the uneven slope of a nose that hooked a little bit at the end, long lashes over a half-lidded eye that was looking back, over the figure's shoulder, and what could only be described as a joyless smile. It curved just slightly upward, but the singular eyebrow Agatha drew was…sad. Together, it looked as though the woman was on the verge of tears.</p><p>Agatha didn't sketch any tears in the singular pale eye.</p><p>She placed her pencil down and stepped away, leaving the figure without hair still.</p><p>She was done for the night.</p><p>She placed the pencil back down on the easel and made her way quickly to the door, sparing only a cursory glance at the photograph on her wall, finally recognizing the shape of Rio's grin in the shadow of Dulce's photograph. Her heart hammered in her chest as she flicked off the lights, plunging the whole room into darkness.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn't expect to see Jen less than twenty-four hours after the woman had been dragged out of the bar by a tiny rocker about half her size for some…fun.</p><p>In her bedroom.</p><p>Sitting at the end of her bed, eyes wide as she waited for Agatha to open hers.</p><p>Agatha practically fell out of the bed at the sight of Jen sitting there, holding two to-go mugs of coffee, a bright smile stretching her lips.</p><p>"What the fuck are you doing in my house?!" Agatha growled, pulling the covers up to her chest as if she were naked (she was not; she had on a pair of cotton pajamas that she'd slipped into after leaving her art studio just a few hours prior) and glared at the other woman.</p><p>"You weren't answering your phone," Jen said with a shrug. She held out one of the coffees and Agatha took it, reaching for her cell phone at the same time as she pushed herself into a sitting position. She blinked at the bright screen in her otherwise dark bedroom.</p><p>It was nearly noon, and she had about a dozen missed calls from Jen. And she'd missed every alarm she'd set. So much for her run.</p><p>She could miss a single day, she guessed, her body still fully rejecting being conscious even as she took a sip of coffee. Agatha let out a moan — it was Jen's fancy scmancy expensive brew. Damn her.</p><p>"I figured you'd be stuck in bed all day," Agatha murmured, smirking around the rim of her travel mug. "Or was Alice not all you hoped?"</p><p>"Oh, she was <em>more</em>," Jen replied, sighing dreamily, resting her chin in her hand. "That shaky hand of hers really comes in handy." She wiggled her eyebrows, and Agatha made a face. "It's like she has settings," Jen explained further.</p><p>"Ew! Jen!" Agatha huffed, wrinkling her nose. "Please spare me the details." She took another sip of the bougie-ass coffee. "Why aren't you with her right now if she's so great?"</p><p>Jen sighed. "Her mother called her in for rehearsal," Jen informed her, pouting. "They have to figure out how to work around her tremors for the tour dates she's going on with them, you know? If it's going to affect the sound of the songs." She shrugged. "But we're having dinner tonight, so I might be a little late getting into the office tomorrow."</p><p>"Don't you usually get there at, like, six AM anyway? For your stupid yoga shit? It's fine if you're a little late. America can handle the morning rush on her own, can't she?"</p><p>"Oh, she's more than capable," Jen agreed. "But I might be even later than <em>you</em> tomorrow. Unless, that is, you and Rio have similar plans tonight…?"</p><p>She raised her eyebrows until they reached the nonexistent hairline as she let the question hang in the air and took another sip of her own coffee.</p><p>"We don't," Agatha said. "She hasn't even texted me."</p><p>Jen deflated a little bit. "That's disappointing," she said. "I thought you two might have had a similar night to mine, but then Rio texted Alice this morning and she said it seemed like she was alone, so…"</p><p>Agatha took another slow sip of her coffee as Jen eyed her over the rim of her own.</p><p>"So…?" she said, once she'd swallowed.</p><p>Jen sighed. "What happened? I thought you two were having such a good night."</p><p>"We <em>did</em> have a good night," Agatha said. "Not all good nights have to end in sex, you know? Unlike <em>some</em> people, I don't climb into bed on the first date."</p><p>"So it <em>was</em> a date!" Jen exclaimed, pointing a finger into Agatha's face.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and slapped the hand away.</p><p>"Didn't your mother ever teach you that it's rude to put your fingers in somebody else's face — DON'T." Jen gave her a wicked grin, but she just shrugged and sipped her coffee. "And it <em>wasn't</em> a date…at least, I don't think so."</p><p>"What makes you uncertain?" Jen asked, seeming genuinely curious. She tilted her head in a way that reminded Agatha of Rio. Her eyes flicked to her phone screen again, but there were no new messages since the last time she checked the phone (two full minutes ago).</p><p>"For one, I sat with you, <em>your</em> date, and Rio's kid sister, who also happens to be the artist whose photograph I bought just last weekend before even <em>meeting</em> the subject of that photograph, who happened to be the woman onstage with whom I may or may not have been on a date."</p><p>"So…it's complicated," Jen said, after a long moment of contemplation. "Life is complicated sometimes, Agatha. So is dating." She took another sip of her coffee and reached past Agatha, placing her empty cup on her bedside table, then she settled in next to her, slipping under the sheets in her bougie hoodie and matching sweatpants. Thankfully, she wasn't wearing shoes, at least. "We were complicated once, too."</p><p>"I remember," Agatha said. "And now we're sisters. I don't want Rio to be my sister." She placed her half-empty cup next to Jen's and leaned back against the headboard.</p><p>"What do you want her to be then?" Jen asked. Agatha could see her grin in the peripheral of her vision.</p><p>"Less annoying than you," Agatha huffed in return. "Which she's already accomplished so far, so that's a plus."</p><p>"Fuck off," Jen snorted. She was silent for a moment. "Seriously, though," she said. "It's obvious you like her. And that she likes you. You two just have to stop being useless lesbians and admit it to each other."</p><p>Agatha elbowed her in the ribs, but she didn't say anything as she took another sip of her drink, thinking…</p><p>"We kissed," she said, finally. "Well, <em>I</em> kissed <em>her</em>."</p><p>Jen's eyes were seconds away from popping out of her skull and rolling around on Agatha's clean purple sheets. "<em>What?!"</em> she squeaked. "When?!"</p><p>"Last night," Agatha said. "I walked her to her door and…Dulce came out. She nearly knocked us both over in her rush to get to your apartment." She furrowed her brow. "Wait, weren't you meant to be helping her today? Why are you <em>here</em>?"</p><p>"She and Morgan were canoodling on the roof when I checked in on them, like, an hour ago. She's fine. Finish the damn story." Jen was leaning in, fully engaged.</p><p>Agatha snorted, rolling her eyes. "She told us where she was going and left," Agatha said. "Then I met Rio's cats."</p><p>"You went inside the apartment?" Jen asked, practically squealing.</p><p>"No," Agatha said. "I didn't get that far. Her cats came out, and I petted them, but I didn't actually go <em>into</em> the apartment. My car was idling on the street, so I couldn't really stay. I just stood up, said goodbye, and I was heading toward the door when I just had this…thought."</p><p>Agatha remembered it clear as day, as though it happened just moments ago instead of nearly twelve hours ago now.</p><p>She had taken no more than three steps in the direction of the sliding electric doors in the lobby. She could see her hazards still flashing just outside, knew that she'd get a ticket if she let her car sit there for too long since it wasn't a parking spot. But there was something keeping her from moving forward. It felt like she was <em>forgetting </em>something, but her pizza was in the car. Her car keys were hanging off the carabiner on her belt loop. Her house keys too. Her phone was in her pocket and her cardigan was on her body. She wasn't really forgetting anything.</p><p>But she <em>was</em>.</p><p>She turned around to see Rio start to hobble into the apartment, heard her chuckle as she admonished Swan for being dramatic about something, saw the curve her cheeks as she smiled and…Agatha didn't actively make the decision to turn and reach for her. It was as though her body was making the decision <em>for</em> her. Her hand had reached out for Rio's elbow before she could even blink and then her face was coming at her and all Agatha could do was press her lips to Rio's.</p><p>By the time her brain caught up, her tongue had swiped out against Rio's bottom lip and she felt the vibration of Rio's moan against her mouth.</p><p>That might have been what snapped her out of whatever trance she was in and made her pull back (several steps, mind you) from the other woman until her back hit the opposite wall and she just stared, wide-eyed, at Rio for several seconds, breathing hard like she'd run a mile.</p><p>Jen was staring as Agatha explained all of this.</p><p>"And then what?" she demanded, leaning in with wide eyes.</p><p>"Then I…thanked her for the pizza," Agatha said. "And I left."</p><p>Jen's eye twitched.</p><p>"You fucking idiot," she murmured.</p><p>Agatha groaned, dragging the comforter over her head. "I <em>know</em>," she said.</p><p>"You absolute imbecile," Jen admonished, grabbing a pillow and hitting her over the head with it. "I ought to smother you and put you out of your misery, but that would be too kind."</p><p>"Okay, that's a little much," Agatha said, popping her head back out from the comforter. Jen hit her full in the face with the pillow. "Rude."</p><p>"Girl!" Jen huffed, hitting her again. "Why," hit, "would," hit, "you," hit, hit, hit, "walk away!?" Another hit. "You absolute buffoon!"</p><p>"I didn't even mean to kiss her!" Agatha argued back, ripping the pillow from Jen's grip.</p><p>"Then what did you mean to do, dumbass?" Jen huffed. "You literally took every step to initiate the kiss!"</p><p>"I wasn't in control of my body," Agatha grumbled, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>"That's even worse!" Jen exclaimed, throwing her hands up. "That means that you were acting on instinct and then you <em>actively fought against</em> that instinct even though it's what <em>both of you</em> wanted!"</p><p>"I don't know that it's what <em>she</em> wanted," Agatha argued.</p><p>"Girl." Jen's face was more serious than Agatha had seen it in a long time. She leveled at her with those big brown eyes of hers. "You deserve good things, Agatha. And, according to Alice, Rio is a <em>very</em> good thing. And she <em>likes</em> you. Let yourself have that."</p><p>Agatha's heart clenched in her chest and her shoulders dropped. "It's not a good time, Jen. I just…I just got diagnosed with a serious medical condition."</p><p>"One that Rio has, too," Jen pointed out.</p><p>"Exactly!" Agatha exclaimed. "And she walks with a cane!"</p><p>"Don't <em>tell me</em> you're gonna be ableist right now, bitch. I thought you were better than that!"</p><p>"No! Oh my God…" Agatha groaned, pressing the pillow over her head. "No, of course I'm not being…I don't care about the cane, okay? If I were perfectly healthy, I wouldn't really think anything of it. I'd probably find it hot."</p><p>"Freak," Jen muttered.</p><p>"Make up your mind!" Agatha shoved Jen's shoulder. "Look, the cane is not the reason I'm second-guessing myself, I don't think. It's…well, okay, maybe it's the thought that, one day, that could be me. I could need a cane someday."</p><p>"So?" Jen huffed. "Then you'd be two bad bitches with canes. So what?"</p><p>"So…" Agatha shook her head. "Jen, I'm a runner. Not just recreationally. I don't <em>do</em> relationships. You know that."</p><p>"Too well," Jen scoffed. "You're only twenty-nine, Agatha."</p><p>"So are you," Agatha retorted. "And you don't have to deal with the bullshit that I do. I have a chronic illness now. It's a lot of baggage to carry into a relationship."</p><p>"Every bad bitch has baggage," Jen said. "Doesn't mean we should have to carry it all ourselves or avoid living our lives to the fullest."</p><p>"Thanks, Gandhi," Agatha replied, patting her knee.</p><p>"Asshole," Jen muttered, but she couldn't fight her grin as she shook her head. "Seriously, though. You're not the only one with baggage. Hell, you'd be hard-pressed to find anybody our age without it. Stop worrying so much and just…go for it. It'll be worth it."</p><p>"Once again, I don't <em>do</em> relationships," Agatha reiterated.</p><p>"Just because you <em>haven't</em> doesn't mean you <em>can't</em>," Jen said. "You might surprise yourself."</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a long moment at that.</p><p>"What if I hurt her?" she asked after a long moment of silence.</p><p>"She's a big girl," Jen replied. "She'll be fine." She nudged Agatha's shoulder. "And look at you, thinking about the feelings of others. Where was that concern for me when you stole my hoodie?"</p><p>"Would you <em>let that go</em>?" Agatha groaned. "You got it back!"</p><p>"After a <em>year</em>!" Jen grumbled, reaching for another pillow to hit her with. "You didn't care about my feelings about it!"</p><p>"It wasn't even a nice hoodie!" Agatha snorted. "Not like these bougie, Egyptian cotton hoodies or whatever you've got now." She tugged on the sleeve of Jen's current hoodie, which was buttery soft and smooth.</p><p>Hmm, she might just need to steal this one from her closet later.</p><p>"It was so!" Jen argued, then grunted. "Not important. Point is, you have <em>got</em> to stop thinking about how it could go wrong and think about how it could go right."</p><p>"When did you become a fortune cookie?"</p><p>"Stop deflecting, Agatha," Jen said, her voice dead serious again. "Rio likes you. You like her. Just…give it a shot. What's the worst that could happen?" Agatha opened her mouth, but Jen placed her hand over it before a single syllable could eek out. "Rhetorical," she said. "You're both grown, adult women. You both like each other and have more or less been pursuing…<em>something</em> for the last week. Just…go for it."</p><p>"But—"</p><p>"No more <em>buts</em>," Jen said. "You've already created this whole list of things that could go wrong in your own head. What about all the things that could go right?"</p><p>"Like what?" Agatha huffed. "We fall in love and have our happily ever after?" she mocked. "That's a fantasy. And we've only known each other a week!"</p><p>"And the chemistry is pure fire," Jen pointed out. "Trust me: I have a PhD in chemistry." Agatha rolled her eyes and nudged Jen as she cackled. "You don't have to jump into anything with her, okay? Take it slow if you must. Rio doesn't exactly strike me as the kind of person who'd try to force you into anything you don't want."</p><p>"Because you know her so well?" Agatha snorted.</p><p>"Alice literally won't shut up about her," Jen said. "I was a little jealous for a minute, but when I asked if she had ever thought about hooking up with her, she literally <em>gagged</em> at the thought." Jen snorted. "God, she's so cute."</p><p>"How are you <em>this</em> into a girl you've known less than three days?" Agatha asked.</p><p>"Look, you may not be a U-Hauler, but <em>I </em>certainly am," Jen said. "I'm ready to risk it all for her. I've already started planning our prenup."</p><p>"How romantic," Agatha snorted.</p><p>"I know, right?" Jen said, wiggling her brows. "If things don't work out with Alice, I'll be really, <em>really</em> sad, but I'll get over it. I know she will, too. But she's worth the risk." She took a deep breath. "You can decide for yourself if Rio is worth the risk, too. I'm not going to push you into doing anything you truly do not want to do, but don't talk yourself out of something that you <em>do</em> want just because it might not turn out perfectly. That's dumb. And you're a lot of things, Agatha Harkness, but you're not dumb."</p><p>"Not sure if I should actually take that as a compliment," Agatha said. "What things am I, exactly?"</p><p>"Annoying, for one," Jen retorted. "Stubborn, thick-headed, bitchy, emotionally-constipated…"</p><p>"Okay, fuck you," Agatha huffed, shoving her away.</p><p>Jen laughed, reaching with her freakishly long arms to wrap them around Agatha, pulling her into a hug that the shorter woman immediately tried to worm out of.</p><p>"But you're also protective of the ones you love, which <em>I know</em> includes me now." She gave Agatha a cheesy grin. "And you're naturally kind, as hard you fight against that instinct."</p><p>"Take that back!" Agatha growled.</p><p>"Never," Jen snorted. "And you are loyal—"</p><p>"Loyalty is for <em>dogs</em>," Agatha huffed. Jen ignored her.</p><p>"And you're creative and smart and hard-working and you're <em>really</em> bad at taking compliments even though you pretend to be full of yourself."</p><p>"Fuck you, I'm exceptional," Agatha huffed, still attempting to shove Jen away, but the other woman had a vice-like grip on her.</p><p>"I know you are," Jen said, hugging Agatha more tightly. "But I also know that you don't actually believe that."</p><p>"Yes I do," Agatha insisted.</p><p>"No you don't," Jen snorted. "But that's fine. It's true whether you believe it or not."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she stopped fighting Jen's hold on her.</p><p>"One day, I hope you <em>will</em> actually believe it, though," Jen said. "I hope you'll stop fighting against it and let yourself have the things that I <em>know</em> you deserve. I hope you'll eventually know that you deserve them, too."</p><p>"I'm guessing Rio is one of those things?" Agatha murmured against Jen's collarbone.</p><p>"She could be," Jen affirmed, "if you would just stop being an idiot."</p><p>"You <em>just</em> said I <em>wasn't</em> an idiot!" Agatha argued.</p><p>"I said you're not <em>dumb</em>," Jen said. "You can still be an idiot even if you're not dumb."</p><p>"I hate you."</p><p>"You love me."</p><p>Agatha hated that she was right. Again.</p><p>Jennifer Kale being right should be a crime.</p><p>They sat there in the bed for a long time before Agatha pulled away. Thankfully, Jen let her go this time, watching her as she reached for her phone and unlocked it.</p><p>"Who are you calling?" she asked.</p><p>"Nobody," Agatha retorted, tapping at her phone's screen. "I'm texting Rio."</p><p>She couldn't see it from the corner of her eye, but she just <em>knew</em> that Jen was giving her that smug smile of hers that Agatha absolutely <em>hated</em>. Bitch.</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:24): </strong>Hey, how'd you sleep?</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:24): </strong>Like the dead. You?</p><p><em>Well, that was quick</em>, Agatha thought with a soft grin. It was as though Rio had been staring at her phone, waiting for her text.</p><p>Had Agatha said she was going to text? Or did Rio expect it because of the barely-there kiss? Why hadn't Rio just texted <em>her</em>?</p><p>"Don't overthink it," Jen murmured from beside her, looking down at her own phone. "Just text."</p><p>Agatha frowned at her. "I wasn't—"</p><p>"Girl, I can hear the gears whirring in your brain," Jen said. "Just chill. Be cool."</p><p>"I'm <em>plenty</em> cool," Agatha huffed, looking back down at her phone. She still hadn't answered Rio. "Um, what would a cool person say to this question?" she asked, showing Jen the text.</p><p>"Um, the truth?" Jen asked, shrugging. "It's a pretty straightforward question."</p><p>"Right," Agatha said, flushing.</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:27): </strong>I slept alright.</p><p>"Lame," Jen snorted when Agatha showed her the response <em>after</em> she'd sent it.</p><p>"You said to be honest!"</p><p>"Honest, not boring."</p><p>"You're the worst."</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:29): </strong>That's cool.</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:30): </strong>Did you burn that monstrosity from last night?</p><p>Agatha snorted, rolling her eyes. Jen peered over her shoulder.</p><p>"What 'monstrosity'?" she asked.</p><p>"My Hawaiian pizza," Agatha laughed, shaking her head.</p><p>"Heathen."</p><p>"You put <em>spinach </em>on your pizza," Agatha huffed. "Don't even <em>talk</em>."</p><p>"It tastes good!" Jen defended.</p><p>"So does pineapple!"</p><p>"Lies!"</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and tapped out a response.</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:32): </strong>I was actually planning on having it for lunch</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:33): </strong>w/some fava beans and a nice chianthi</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:34): </strong>fitting for a psychopath</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:35): </strong>what plans do you have for the rest of the day?</p><p>Agatha felt her face warm at that. She could feel Jen's smile over her shoulder, and she did her best to ignore it as she tried to formulate a response.</p><p>"Just be honest," Jen sung in her ear. Agatha swatted at her like she was a fly, hitting her in the cheek.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip as she stared at the empty text box on her phone, the blinking line waiting for her to type something, the keyboard…</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:38): </strong>Depends…what did you have in mind?</p><p>"Thattagirl," Jen said, patting her on the shoulder.</p><p>"Shut up," Agatha grumbled as she watched the three little dots do the wave on her screen. Her heart was thumping a pattern against her ribcage as she waited for the words to appear on the screen.</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:40): </strong>How do you feel about gardening?</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened at that, and she showed Jen the text.</p><p>Jen's eyebrows rose at that.</p><p>"Does she know you kill every plant you touch?"</p><p>She received a swift punch to the ribs for that.</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:42): </strong>I'm like the Grim Reaper when it comes to gardening</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:42): </strong>but for flowers</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:43): </strong>good thing I'm not working w/flowers today</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:43): </strong>and it's not so much gardening as harvesting</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:44): </strong>usually I use alice as my free labor</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:44): </strong>but she's at rehearsal so…</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:45): </strong>who said my labor is free?</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:45): </strong>I'm sure we can come to an agreement on compensation</p><p>"Ooh," Jen said into her ear. "Like kisses?" She made kissy noises that made Agatha want to punch her right in the mouth.</p><p>She settled for flicking her between the eyes. Jen shoved her, pouting as she rubbed the affected spot on her forehead. Agatha snickered.</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:46): </strong>like more hawaiian pizza?</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:46): </strong>okay 1) that shit is canadian, not hawaiian</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:47): </strong>2) I can think of something better as payment</p><p>"So she <em>is</em> going to pay you in kisses!" Jen exclaimed.</p><p>"Will you go home!" Agatha huffed. "And stopped snooping, nosy!"</p><p>"Ugh," Jen huffed. "There's nothing to <em>do</em> at home!"</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at Jen, then a thought came to her and she grinned, turning back to her phone.</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:48): </strong>Mind if I bring an extra set of hands with me to help?</p><p><strong>Rio💀🌺 (12:48): </strong>The more the merrier!</p><p><strong>Agatha (12:49): </strong>Great! Just let me know when and where we should meet you!</p><p>Rio sent a thumbs up and then a location and time a few moments later while Agatha was padding around her room, looking for garden-appropriate clothing. She found an old pair of paint-splattered overalls and a pair of thick leather boots in the back of her closet.</p><p>Jen watched her, brows furrowed.</p><p>"I'm not going," she said.</p><p>"Yes, you are," Agatha responded, simply, like it was a fact of life.</p><p>"I don't do dirt, Agatha," Jen huffed, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>"I've <em>seen</em> you take baths in mud, Jennifer," Agatha retorted.</p><p>"That's <em>different</em>!" Jen exclaimed. "That mud was <em>healing</em>!"</p><p>"This dirt could be <em>healing</em>, as well," Agatha shot back. "And it's <em>organic</em>!"</p><p>"We don't know that," Jen grumbled.</p><p>"You think Rio manufactures her own dirt?" Agatha scoffed.</p><p>"I don't know her life," Jen muttered.</p><p>"Come on, Jen," Agatha said. "You <em>just</em> said that there was nothing to do at home. Now you have something to do while you wait for your dinner date with Alice!"</p><p>"But I'm gonna get <em>dirty</em>," Jen practically moaned.</p><p>"Good thing man invented showers," Agatha shot back, tossing her an old tee and a pair of jeans for Jen to borrow. They'd be a little short and probably loose in the hips, but Agatha also had belts.</p><p>"You expect me to believe that <em>men</em> invented showers?" Jen snorted. "Not a chance." She wrinkled her nose at the jeans. "No way," she said. "I'm not going."</p><p>She tossed them down onto Agatha's bed like that was the final say.</p><p>Forty minutes later, she sat grumpily in the passenger seat of Agatha's car as they made their way up the driveway of some small farm in a more rural part of New Jersey. Jen was wearing Agatha's jeans, which, as predicted, stopped just before her ankles, and a pair of Agatha's boots, which miraculously fit her just fine with a bare of thick socks on her feet. She also wore one of Agatha's faded hoodies over the tee she borrowed.</p><p>"I hate you," Jen grumbled, not for the first time, as Agatha pulled up behind a pickup truck, sending off a quick text to Rio to let her know that they had arrived at the address she'd sent her.</p><p>"You love me," Agatha snorted, slipping out of the car. "Now get out."</p><p>Jen growled at her, but she did end up getting out of the orange SUV. She looked like a petulant child with her pouty lips and furrowed brows.</p><p>"Hey," Agatha said, "this was <em>your</em> idea, remember? I would have happily stayed in bed all day had you not needled me into texting Rio."</p><p>"Me and my big mouth," Jen huffed, stomping after Agatha as she made her way toward the front door of the modestly-sized house next to a fenced-in pumpkin patch.</p><p>Before Agatha could make it all the way up the path to the door, it opened and Rio stepped out, wearing a pair of overalls not too unlike the ones Agatha had put on, only hers were green and far more worn in the knees. She wore a long-sleeve thermal shirt underneath them. Her cane was held securely in her right hand. She grinned when she locked eyes with Agatha.</p><p>Agatha's entire face went warm when she remembered the sensation of those lips against hers from the night before.</p><p>Rio's grin flickered when she saw Jen coming up behind her, but it didn't drop entirely.</p><p>"When you said you were bringing an extra set of hands," Rio said, "I did <em>not</em> think you meant Jen."</p><p>"I've been kidnapped," Jen said. "Call the police."</p><p>"Stop being dramatic," Agatha huffed. "She's just trying to kill time before her date with Alice tonight, so I figured we could put her to work."</p><p>"I <em>better</em> get proper compensation for this," Jen said, glaring at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha waved her off, keeping her eyes on Rio. "So," she said, "what, exactly, are we harvesting?"</p><p>"Nothing too crazy," Rio said. "Just some pumpkins." She motioned toward the pumpkin patch, which was far smaller than the one that Gran had taken her to every fall as a child to pick a pumpkin for them to carve together for their front yard. This one looked like it had been started almost by accident, but kept going out of habit or something.</p><p>"Those look <em>heavy</em>, Agatha!" Jen whined in her ear. Agatha elbowed her away.</p><p>"Did you grow those?" she asked Rio.</p><p>"Not by myself," Rio answered, turning to admire the small patch of pumpkins. "I'm more of a helper, to be honest. This is all Tio's doing."</p><p>"Tio?" Agatha asked. "I thought you said you didn't have any uncles."</p><p>"Oh, he's not my uncle," Rio said. "He's the guy that I used to work for at the flower shop. His nieces and nephews used to have part-time jobs there, too, so he just came to be known as Tio. His real name is <em>Jesús</em>."</p><p>"Why aren't his nieces and nephews helping him then?" Jen grumbled.</p><p>Agatha elbowed her again and gave her a look.</p><p>"Because it's my turn," Rio chuckled. "I volunteered to take pumpkin duty this year. I didn't expect them to get quite that big though." She frowned looking at the plump pumpkins. "Chuché and Lupe are on their way to help, too, though."</p><p>"Who?" Agatha asked, blinking at her.</p><p>"Tio's nephew and grand-niece," Rio informed her with a soft smile. "Chuché will do most of the heavy lifting. We just need to cut the vines and plant the seeds for the next bath. Lupe likes that part."</p><p>"And where, exactly, are we taking these pumpkins?" Agatha asked.</p><p>"Just loading them into Tio's pickup truck," Rio said, motioning to the truck parked in front of Agatha's car. "He's gonna sell them at a farmer's market in town tomorrow with his nieces."</p><p>"Not gonna make much of a profit, is he?" Jen commented. Agatha glared at her. "What?" she said, holding up her hands. "I've seen farmers come in with <em>hundreds</em> of pumpkins at those markets. That's, like, three dozen at most."</p><p>"His main income comes from his flower shop," Rio explained. "The pumpkins are just a kind of yearly side hustle. Maybe semi-annual, if the weather's right for it. He didn't even mean to start growing the pumpkins. They just happened."</p><p>"How do pumpkin patches just happen?" Agatha asked as they started walking to said patch.</p><p>"Your wife's idiot nephew gets drunk on too many ales one October night, eats about a pound of the pumpkin seeds you were planning on roasting, and then pukes on the land where you were previously growing tomatoes," Rio explained with a grin. "Tio thought he'd discovered a new kind of tomato when they started growing a few months later. Now, he just grows them all year round. Replanted the tomatoes elsewhere, too."</p><p>Jen's estimate of three dozen was right on the money, it seemed. There were just under forty pumpkins, of various shapes and sizes. All of them were bright orange with dark green stems, all perfectly ripe and ready to be cut from the vines.</p><p>"These look fantastic," Jen said. "Like a painting. That color is so vibrant." She slipped her phone from her pocket. "Mind if I take a picture? I've been looking for some autumn inspiration for my art."</p><p>Rio shrugged. "Go ahead," she said.</p><p>Jen immediately started taking pictures.</p><p>"Why would you volunteer to do this?" Agatha asked, quietly. "I mean, it's gotta be hard with the…" she motioned to Rio's cane.</p><p>"Picking up the heavier ones is, yeah," Rio admitted. "But Tio helps me with that for the most part. This year, he hurt his back, which is where Chuché and Lupe come in. Besides that, there's not much anybody else can do that I can't. Even with the cane."</p><p>Agatha absorbed that for a moment, before nodding. "Yeah," she said, "of course. Sorry."</p><p>"Nothing to apologize for," Rio assured her. "It's a pretty common assumption."</p><p>"Still, I shouldn't just assume that—"</p><p>"Look who's here," Rio interrupted, looking past Agatha's shoulder and hobbling a few steps around her. "Lupe!"</p><p>"Rio!" a high voice squealed. Agatha turned just as a blur of red slammed against Rio's front, nearly knocking her over. Agatha reached out as if to catch her, but Rio caught herself on her good leg and her cane, wrapping her arm around a slightly shorter body.</p><p>"<em>¿Cómo estás?"</em> Rio laughed into a pile of red curls.</p><p>"<em>Bien!</em>" the little body squeaked. "<em>Te he extrañado mucho!"</em></p><p>"<em>Yo Tambien, </em>baby girl," Rio replied, pulling back. "How's your mom? And your brothers?"</p><p>"Luis is annoying, as always," the little girl said in English. "And Pedro is always grumpy now. Mami says he's going through," she lowered her voice and leaned in, "<em>puberty</em>."</p><p>Agatha couldn't help herself as she snorted out a laugh, alerting the girl to her presence. She had the biggest, roundest, greenest eyes that Agatha had ever seen, her face a constellation of freckles. Her cheeks turned pink and she went somewhat shy, pressing herself to Rio's front. Rio placed her hands on her shoulders.</p><p>"Lupe," she said, "this is Agatha and Jen, my friends from Westview. They're going to help us with the cutting and planting today."</p><p>"<em>Hola</em>," Lupe mumbled. "<em>Cómo están</em>?"</p><p>"<em>Estoy bien,</em>" Agatha answered with a kind smile, holding out her hand. "<em>¿Y tú?</em>"</p><p>"<em>¿La gringa habla español?" </em>Lupe asked, looking up at Rio, who snorted and poked her in the side, eliciting a giggle.</p><p>"Don't call her that, jerk," she said, offering Agatha an apologetic smile.</p><p>Lupe's giggles were a little mischievous, as was the glint in her eyes, but she was still pretty shy. Still, she reached out to shake Agatha's outstretched hand. Then Jen's.</p><p>"Ooh, I <em>love</em> your hair," Jen said. "It's so gorgeous and curly."</p><p>"Thanks!" Lupe said, reaching up to play with the bright red curls sticking out of her ponytail. "I like your…" Her eyes went wide when she realized that Jen was bald. "…sweater. It looks soft."</p><p>Agatha had to bite her lip to keep from laughing out loud at the way Jen's face flickered though the taller woman's bright smile never dropped, to her credit.</p><p>"Thanks," Jen said, her voice a little strangled.</p><p>"Okay!" a booming voice came from behind them. Agatha turned to see a man with dark curly hair graying at the roots come up behind them. He had a wide grin and broad shoulders. He was a giant of a man with a kind face. "Let's get started, shall we?" His voice was deep and thick with an accent. He smiled at Jen and Agatha, both of whom were dwarfed by his immense height. "Hello, <em>señoritas</em>," he said. "I'm Chuché. Nice to meet you both."</p><p>"Jen," Jen said, shaking his hand.</p><p>"Agatha," Agatha said, doing the same.</p><p>Something in his eyes flickered at that, and he glanced at Rio with a small smile, but said nothing.</p><p>"Okay," he said, "now that we all know each other, let's get to pumpkin smashing."</p><p>"Pumpkin <em>picking</em>, papi," Lupe sighed, rolling her eyes.</p><p>"Isn't that what I said?" Chuché said, winking at Agatha.</p><p>Lupe rolled her eyes, looking at Rio. "<em>Men</em>," she huffed, before stomping off toward the pumpkin patch."</p><p>"I like her," Jen said, grinning at Rio as she followed after the little girl.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she snorted, but she didn't miss the little grin that Rio sent her way — or the subsequent glare she sent Chuché when he bumped her shoulder as they started their own walk toward the pumpkin patch.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Chapter Twelve</b></p><p><span>If Agatha never saw another pumpkin for as long as she lived, she’d be alright with that. She’d never particularly been a fan of pumpkins, anyway, but she was even less of a fan after having to heft them across the tiny patch and into the bed of Tio’s pickup truck.</span></p><p><span>Her back felt like a slinky as she carried the last pumpkin across the gravel driveway and plopped it down on the pile. She bent at the waist next to the truck, groaning at the aches and pains that vibrated down her spine. She could physically </span><em><span>feel</span></em><span> the myelin peeling away from her spine, both due to her MS and the work she’d just spent the last two hours doing.</span></p><p><span>She needed to lie down. Preferably on a bed or a couch, but she wouldn’t actually be all that opposed to the gravel, so long as she were horizontal. She could make it work.</span></p><p><span>“You’re so dramatic,” Jen snorted, sidling up next to her.</span></p><p><span>“You have no room to talk,” Agatha huffed, glaring at her through the lock of sweaty hair that had fallen out of her ponytail and now kept getting in the way of her vision. “I saw the tears in your eyes when you chipped a nail.”</span></p><p><span>“It </span><em><span>hurt</span></em><span>,” Jen muttered, looking at the offending pointer finger, which had an ugly-shaped chip taken out of it. “And these were </span><em><span>expensive</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>“Cry me a river,” Agatha huffed, red-faced and sweaty. “You barely did any work.”</span></p><p><span>“I helped Rio cut the vines!” Jen pointed out. “It’s not </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> fault you opted for carrying the pumpkins instead of cutting them with us.”</span></p><p><span>“It would have taken a lot longer to lug the damn things to the truck if Chuché was doing it all by himself,” Agatha said. “I didn’t think walking back and forth twenty feet would be so </span><em><span>tiring</span></em><span>.” She straightened up, groaning at the twinge in her lower back, and took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span>“Well, look at the bright side,” Jen said, leaning up against the truck next to her: “at least you got a workout today. And,” she lowered her voice, “you got to see Rio get all sweaty, too.” She waggled her eyebrows, suggestively.</span></p><p><span>“There’s something wrong with you,” Agatha said. “Psychologically.”</span></p><p><span>“At least I’m not a pussy when it comes to my feelings,” Jen retorted. “And </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> actually have a date tonight, so” she stuck out her tongue to punctuate her sentence.</span></p><p><span>“Does Alice know that she’s dating a toddler?” Agatha snorted.</span></p><p><span>“Heads up!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha and Jen both turned toward the voice just as a water bottle flew right by Jen’s shoulder and the taller woman squeaked, falling to the floor in surprise.</span></p><p><span>“Sorry!” Chuché called, but that didn’t stop him from throwing a second bottle – more gently this time – in Agatha’s direction. She caught it with a surprising amount of ease and nodded back to him in thanks before unscrewing the lid and downing a quarter of it in three deep gulps.</span></p><p><span>“The hell is wrong with you?” she heard Rio huff, but there was laughter in her voice as she hobbled toward them. Agatha looked up to see Chuché rubbing his arm with an exaggerated pout while a dirt-covered Lupe shook her hand at him with her hands on her hips. Rio caught her gaze and rolled her eyes with a little lopsided smirk, and Agatha’s heart did a stupid little cartoony skip. “Sorry about him,” Rio said. “He grew up around a lot of guys who could take a water bottle to the head.”</span></p><p><span>“You callin’ us hard-headed?” Chuché huffed, playfully.</span></p><p><span>“Very,” Lupe said before Rio could even respond. Rio snorted and held up her hand. Lupe ran to slap it, giggling as her father’s jaw dropped in mock outrage.</span></p><p><span>“You’re grounded,” he huffed.</span></p><p><span>“No, I’m not,” Lupe retorted, confidently, her hands on her hips, her dirt-streaked ginger hair falling out of her ponytail like springs. </span></p><p><span>Chuché didn’t even try to argue with her, just pouting at his daughter. Lupe rolled her eyes and ran at him, throwing her arms around his waist. His pout turned into a smile as he chuckled, brushing a kiss to her forehead as he squeezed her tightly, lifting her up and spinning her around as she squealed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched them, her chest aching a little bit, her eyes burning. She forced herself to look away, clearing her throat as she tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. </span></p><p><span>“So,” she said, “anything else we need to do?” She looked back at Rio, who was already facing her, an odd look on her face. </span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” Rio said, after a second of just continuing to watch Agatha. “Yeah. We just need to plant the new seeds. That’s usually Lupe’s job.” She smiled down at the girl, whose father had placed her down on the ground. </span></p><p><span>Lupe reached into her pocket and pulled out a couple packets of pumpkin seeds, grinning through the dirt on her face. “It’s the </span><em><span>best</span></em><span> part!” she told them.</span></p><p><span>“You need help?” Jen asked, nearly knocking Agatha on her ass in shock. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>You’re</span></em><span> offering to help with planting seeds?” Agatha asked, eyes wide. </span></p><p><span>“I’m a helpful person,” Jen huffed, crossing her arms. </span></p><p><span>“Since </span><em><span>when</span></em><span>?”</span></p><p><span>“Listen, bitch–”</span></p><p><span>“Language,” Chuché and Lupe said in unison.</span></p><p><span>“Please!” Rio snorted, looking at the former. “I’ve heard you say </span><em><span>way</span></em><span> worse in front of your toddler.”</span></p><p><span>“Lie! Don’t listen to her, Lupita…and don’t tell your mother.”</span></p><p><span>Lupe rolled her eyes again, but then she grabbed Jen’s hand and started tugging her in the direction of the now mostly bare patch of soil. “You can help,” she said, “but you have to do everything I say.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, Ma’am,” Jen said, smiling affectionately down at the girl. “You’re the boss.”</span></p><p><span>“And she knows it,” Chuché muttered under his breath, but when Agatha looked at him his eyes were shining with affection, a little grin on his lips.</span></p><p><span>Her chest ached again and she swallowed thickly, looking back to Rio. </span></p><p><span>“She’s cute,” she said. “And bossy.”</span></p><p><span>Rio snorted. “Yeah,” she said. “She definitely gets that from her mother.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, without a doubt,” Chuché said.</span></p><p><span>“I’m telling her you said that,” Rio said, placing her hand on Agatha’s back. As Chuché spluttered after her, she guided Agatha toward the porch. “Come on,” she said. “Let’s get something to eat. I think Tio made guacamole and tostadas.”</span></p><p><span>“What are tostadas?” Agatha asked, trying to ignore the heat that sprouted from Rio’s hand.</span></p><p><span>“Tortilla chips,” Rio informed her. “Homemade. Tio’s a great cook. His guac is a little spicy, though. I hope you don’t mind.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m okay with a little spice,” Agatha retorted, and it may have sounded a bit flirtatious. But that was a total accident. Honestly. That doesn’t mean she didn’t feel a slight thrill at the way Rio’s cheeks went just slightly pinker (from what Agatha could see under the dirt she’d wiped there, anyway).</span></p><p><span>“Well, it’s not just a </span><em><span>little</span></em><span>,” Rio warned. “He’s Mexican. He likes his spice. It can really get intense.”</span></p><p><span>“I can handle it,” Agatha assured her as they stepped through the screen door straight into a large living space. The house had an open floor plan, with the kitchen visible from the front door. There was a man hobbling around, slightly bent over as he shuffled around the kitchen, grabbing ingredients to toss into three separate bowls. </span></p><p><span>He looked up when they entered.</span></p><p><span>“You’re done already?” he asked. </span></p><p><span>“Chuché pulled his weight this time,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>“Hey!” a voice called from the other side of the screen door. </span></p><p><span>Rio snickered as she hobbled inside, leaning heavily on her cane. She was favoring her good leg more than usual now, but she didn’t show any signs of pain otherwise. Agatha still glanced at her from time to time as she led her to the kitchen island, Rio’s hand still a welcome weight on the small of her back. Her touch was warm and a little bit electric, sending shivers up Agatha’s spine.</span></p><p><span>She mourned the loss of Rio’s electric fingers when they reached the sink, their elbows knocking together as they washed as much dirt as possible off of their hands. Then, the other woman perched herself on a stool at the island, in front of the three bowls of guacamole and an even bigger bowl of chips. She motioned for Agatha to claim the stool next to her, which she did with a shy smile.</span></p><p><span>“Wow,” Agatha said, eyeing the food. “That is a </span><em><span>lot</span></em><span> of guacamole.”</span></p><p><span>“I have to make three different batches,” Tio informed her, “to account for different tastes.” He pointed to the red bowl. “This one has serrano peppers; it is the spiciest.” He pointed to the blue bowl. “This one has jalapeños; it’s mild. Very good.” He pointed to the green bowl just in front of Rio. “That one is Rio’s guacamole: it is not spicy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned to look at Rio, who avoided her gaze as she plucked a chip and dipped it into the green bowl of guacamole. She was blushing again.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt the taunt rising in her throat, but she swallowed it back as she reached for a chip of her own, dipping it into the blue bowl.</span></p><p><span>“Ah,” Tio said, “a mild girl.” He nodded. “That’s alright. Not everybody can handle serranos…or any spice at all.” He glanced pointedly at Rio, who glared back at him. He snickered.</span></p><p><span>“I just wanted to see how spicy you consider mild to be,” Agatha said. “I happen to love spicy food, but it’s definitely an acquired tolerance.”</span></p><p><span>She took a bite of the chip and hummed. This was </span><em><span>really</span></em><span> good guacamole. The avocados tasted perfectly ripe and there was a good balance in the onions, tomatoes, and cilantro. It had just the right amount of saltiness, too. </span></p><p><span>“One that Rio has not acquired.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay, Tio,” Rio huffed. “Not all of us were bottle fed hot sauce as an infant. Just because I don’t </span><em><span>like </span></em><span>your spicy ass peppers doesn’t mean I can’t take it.”</span></p><p><span>“Prove it then,” Tio said, plucking up the red bowl and placing it in front of Rio. “Take a bite.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blanched, looking at the bowl, then up at Tio. Then, for some reason, she cast a glance at Agatha, who just took another bite of her own chip, munching slowly as she watched the exchange.</span></p><p><span>Rio turned back to Tio and glared at him before picking up a chip and dipping it into the red bowl, scooping up a small amount at first.</span></p><p><span>“Ah!” Tio scoffed, shaking his head. He said nothing more, but that single noise was </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> condescending. And challenging.</span></p><p><span>Rio accepted the challenge by dipping her chip again, piling it with the guacamole until it crackled, straining under the weight of all the ingredients. A large chunk of red serrano pepper was submerged halfway into the green mixture. Agatha’s eyes widened at it, wondering if Rio saw it as well.</span></p><p><span>If she did, she made no move to flick it off the chip – that would have been admitting weakness. The staring contest she was currently having with Tio left no room for weakness. She stared that man directly in the eye as she brought the chip to her lips. Tio stared back, a glimmer of mirth in his eyes and in the sideways quirk of his lips. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand hesitated a bit before reaching her lips, her eyes flicking down to stare at the single bit of pepper atop the small mountain of green. Agatha heard her take a deep breath in through her nose before her lips parted and she shoved the entire chip into her mouth.</span></p><p><span>Tio and Agatha watched her chew for a long moment. Rio continued to glare at him as she chewed slowly and then swallowed, clearing her throat. Agatha didn’t miss the beads of sweat that formed at her hairline, but Rio didn’t blink or move to swipe them away, obviously trying to prove a point even as her cheeks reddened and a tear formed at the corner of her eye.</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached for another chip and dipped it into the red bowl, which snapped both Rio’s </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> Tio’s attention toward her. She offered them a small smile as she casually brought the chip to her lips and, like Rio, ate the whole thing in one bite.</span></p><p><span>Tio’s big bushy gray eyebrows reached to his receding hairline, his hazel eyes widening in shock and awe as Agatha chewed and swallowed.</span></p><p><span>“Not bad,” she said. “A little bit spicy, but pretty good, nonetheless.”</span></p><p><span>Tio’s jaw dropped and he spluttered for a moment. “A </span><em><span>little bit</span></em><span>?!?!?” he exclaimed. “What do you mean </span><em><span>a little bit</span></em><span>?!?!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shrugged. “I’ve had spicier,” she said.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t a lie. She’d been a fan of spicy food throughout high school and college. Gran couldn’t have much in the way of spice, but Agatha’s ‘rebellious’ face involved her pouring way too much hot sauce on everything she ate for a long time. Now, as an adult woman with a fully-formed prefrontal cortex, she had no idea what the purpose of that was. She wasn’t actually </span><em><span>rebelling</span></em><span> (Gran didn’t give a shit how spicy her food was so long as she didn’t force </span><em><span>her</span></em><span> to eat it) and she’d given herself a number of stomachaches as she adapted to the spice. </span></p><p><span>Now, at least, she could tolerate a certain level of spice. Like serrano peppers, which were spicier than jalapeños (which Agatha enjoyed from time to time) but not by </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> much. </span></p><p><span>Rio looked like she was dying inside, though, even as she stared in shock at Agatha, who licked the remnants of the spicy guacamole from her lips. Her cheeks went even redder if that was possible. Agatha just smirked, looking between her and Tio, who looked like he was still fuming that the </span><em><span>gringa</span></em><span> called his spiciest guac “just a little spicy” which seemed to have initiated a hard reset in the man’s brain. </span></p><p><span>He started muttering something in Spanish as he huffed out of the room, shaking his head and casting glances back at Agatha as he disappeared down the hall. A door clicked shut a moment later.</span></p><p><span>“Want milk or something?” Agatha asked, grinning at Rio, who was still sweating. Her nose had also started to run and there were tears gathering at the corners of both eyes, escaping and running down her cheeks.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, please,” Rio croaked, fanning at her mouth. “Or sour cream. Whatever you can find in the fridge.” She motioned toward the fridge and Agatha jumped up, practically skipping to the fridge to grab whatever dairy product she could find to ease the burn.</span></p><p><span>There was no sour cream, but there was a half-empty gallon of milk on the top shelf, which she grabbed. She was about to ask Rio where the cups were when the gallon was torn from her hands. Agatha’s eyes widened as she watched Rio desperately unscrew the top and place her mouth right over the top, then tip her head back to chug as much of the milk as possible, tears streaming down her cheeks still. </span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Agatha said, after Rio had definitely drunk enough. She placed her hands on the now nearly-empty container of milk. “That’s enough,” she said, helping Rio to lower it and remove it from her mouth. “You’re going to puke if you keep going.”</span></p><p><span>“Will that make the burning stop?” Rio asked, sniffling as her nose continued to run.</span></p><p><span>“It might make it worse,” Agatha informed her, handing her a paper towel, “considering the contents of your stomach right now.”</span></p><p><span>Rio whimpered. “I had spicy food,” she said. “I always have. That doesn’t make me weak.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha frowned, stepping in front of her. “I know,” she said, softly, wiping the tears from her face with another paper towel. Rio’s eyes widened slightly at the touch. “I’m not judging you, even though </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> judged my Hawaiian pizza.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s different,” Rio defended weakly. “It’s from Canada.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “So I should be mocked for having </span><em><span>Canadian</span></em><span> pizza then?”</span></p><p><span>“Anybody should,” Rio muttered. Agatha barked out a laugh, shaking her head.</span></p><p><span>“You are ridiculous,” she said, rolling her eyes affectionately. </span></p><p><span>Rio pouted and sniffled, and Agatha fought the urge to lean in and catch her bottom lip with her own. Instead, she started to move back away, but Rio’s hand on her hip stilled her. Agatha flushed, her eyes widening at the warm touch, once again, at her lower back. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s big brown (very watery) eyes were on her now. Staring into Agatha’s own blue eyes. Agatha felt rooted to the spot, as though she wouldn’t have been able to move even if she wanted to. She swallowed thickly as Rio tilted her head. </span></p><p><span>“Why did you leave last night?” Rio asked, which took Agatha off-guard.</span></p><p><span>“What?” Agatha asked, blinking down at her. “Because my car was double-parked, remember? I didn’t want to get a ticket.”</span></p><p><span>“But you kissed me,” Rio said, and Agatha’s stomach fluttered. Something in her had thought (prayed? Dreaded?) Rio would be the one to bring it up, but she didn’t think it would happen so soon. She’d thought that maybe they’d have a little more time to ignore it.</span></p><p><span>“Right,” Agatha said, breaking eye contact as her face burned. “Yeah, I did. I’m really sorry about that. I shouldn’t have–”</span></p><p><span>“Left.”</span></p><p><span>“Huh?” Agatha asked, her eyes flicking back up to meet Rio’s again.</span></p><p><span>“You shouldn’t have left,” Rio clarified. “I didn’t even get a chance to reciprocate.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s knees felt weak. Was that from the pumpkin harvesting, the MS, or…?</span></p><p><span>She felt Rio’s fingers squeeze her hip a little bit. Agatha swallowed thickly, her heart hammering against her ribcage as their eyes locked again.</span></p><p><span>“S-sorry,” she said, clearing her throat, “I just…I thought…I figured…” she let out a soft groan and closed her eyes. “I honestly don’t know what I thought. Your hand is very distracting.” </span></p><p><span>The corners of Rio’s lips quirked up at that. “Oh?” she asked, rubbing her thumb against the denim of Agatha’s overalls. Agatha felt the touch as if it were burning straight to the bare skin at her hip. Her breath stuttered in her lungs, her throat was suddenly dry. Their faces were getting closer, but Agatha couldn’t tell if Rio was the one moving closer or…</span></p><p><span>“How could I have </span><em><span>possibly</span></em><span> been putting seeds in the ground </span><em><span>wrong</span></em><span>?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took several steps back, her eyes going wide when Rio tossed the milk at her and motioned toward the fridge. Agatha nodded and shoved what was left of the milk into the refrigerator before slamming the door shut </span><em><span>just</span></em><span> as Lupe, Jen, and Chuché walked through the door, the two former bickering.</span></p><p><span>“If you don’t plant them correctly,” Lupe was saying, “then they won’t </span><em><span>grow</span></em><span> correctly. Tio’s gonna have a bunch of lopsided pumpkins!” She threw her hands up in the air dramatically.</span></p><p><span>“At least they’ll have character then,” Jen retorted, leaning against the island. “I can use them as part of an art installation.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll have to pay for them first,” Lupe said, walking to the sink. “Don’t touch!” she scolded Jen as the woman reached for a tostada chip. “Your hands are covered in dirt and manure. That’s so gross!”</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Manure?</span></em><span>” Jen practically squealed. “I didn’t know there was manure in that muck!” She held her hands away from her body as she rushed to the sink, hip-checking the child out of the way and pumping a generous dollop of foaming soap onto her hands.</span></p><p><span>“How do you think we get the pumpkins to grow so nice and vibrant?” Chuché said, handing Jen a hand towel before stepping up to the sink himself.</span></p><p><span>“Is it really the shit that does that?”</span></p><p><span>“Language,” Lupe said, shoving her aside to also stick her hands under the spray.</span></p><p><span>Jen rolled her eyes, but Agatha didn’t miss the fond smile on her lips as she went back to the island, grabbing a chip and immediately dipping a chip into the red bowl. Rio opened her mouth to warn her, but Agatha subtly shook her head over Jen’s shoulder. Rio pressed her lips together instead and just waited for the show to start.</span></p><p><span>Jen didn’t disappoint. Within seconds she was pacing around the room, fanning her mouth with tears streaming down her face, </span><em><span>begging</span></em><span> for water.</span></p><p><span>“Water isn’t going to help,” Chuché told her, munching on his own chip piled high with the red bowl guacamole. “You need milk.” He nodded toward the fridge. Agatha sent a grin toward Rio as she opened the fridge and pulled the milk back out, handing it right over to Jen, who demolished it in </span><em><span>seconds</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>It was impressive.</span></p><p><span>Well, to everybody except for Tio, who came walking down the hall just as Jen swallowed the last bit, still sweating and fanning her mouth.</span></p><p><span>“Did you just drink all my milk?” he asked, hands on his hips.</span></p><p><span>“Sorry!” Jen said, wiping her forehead. “I couldn’t help it. Too hot. I’ll buy you more.”</span></p><p><span>“Red bowl?” he asked Chuché. </span></p><p><span>“Red bowl,” everybody responded in unison.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t worry about it,” Tio chuckled. “Consider it a thank you for all the work you’ve done today…and an apology for what’s going to happen later when that stuff gotta come back out.”</span></p><p><span>Jen groaned, pressing her hand to her stomach at the thought. Agatha snickered, shaking her head. She caught Rio’s eye from across the kitchen and found that the other woman was already smiling at her. She felt her face go warm and she swallowed thickly, looking back down at the bowls of guacamole, plucking another tostada.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>They were driving back to Westview (Jen insistent that she had to shower thrice before her date with Alice) when her phone vibrated with a series of texts.</span></p><p><b>Rio💀🌺(4:57PM): </b><span>Do you have any plans tonight?</span></p><p><b>Rio💀🌺(4:57PM): </b><span>I mean, besides helping Jen get ready for her date with Alice</span></p><p><b>Rio💀🌺(4:58PM): </b><span>I still have to pay you for all your help with the pumpkins.</span></p><p><b>Rio💀🌺(4:58PM): </b><span>Not in pizza though</span></p><p><b>Rio💀🌺(4:59PM):</b><span> But maybe a drink?</span></p><p><b>Rio💀🌺(4:59PM):</b><span> Or ice cream? My mouth is still burning.</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted at that last one while they were sitting at a light.</span></p><p><span>“What’s so funny?” Jen asked, trying to peek over at the texts. </span></p><p><span>“Nothing,” Agatha said, turning her phone away. “Stop being nosy.”</span></p><p><span>“Is it </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>?” Jen asked in a teasing tone, throwing in a little shoulder shimmy for good measure.</span></p><p><span>“You’re a child,” Agatha huffed, putting her phone back into her pocket as the light turned green.</span></p><p><span>“I know you are, but what am I?” Jen taunted. Then she stuck out her tongue.</span></p><p><span>“What does Alice see in you?” Agatha huffed.</span></p><p><span>“Her own to–” Agatha reacted immediately, slapping her hand over Jen’s mouth.</span></p><p><span>“I hate you,” she growled. “I mean it this time.” </span></p><p><span>She could feel Jen’s grin against the palm of her hand, felt the vibration of her snort and the little puff of air on the side of her hand. Jen swatted her hand away, gently.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t be so dramatic,” she said. “So what plans does Rio have?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha considered not telling her. She considered driving in silence for the rest of the trip, dropping Jen off and only speaking to threaten her about getting her clothes back in a timely manner (she fully expected Jen to bring up The Hoodie again). But she honestly wanted to talk to somebody about this. And Jen was pretty much her only friend.</span></p><p><span>“Drinks,” she said. “Or ice cream.”</span></p><p><span>“Why not both?” Jen asked. “Honestly, ice cream sounds pretty good right now.” She fanned at her mouth. “Damn, that guacamole was hot.”</span></p><p><span>“It was good, though,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>So</span></em><span> good,” Jen agreed. She’d taken some of the “Rio” guacamole after she stopped practically sobbing from the spicy stuff. Then she’d switched to the jalapeño guacamole, finding a happy medium there. “But damn that was a shock.”</span></p><p><span>“It was funny, too,” Agatha snorted, cackling when Jen shoved her shoulder. “You want us to crash?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>“We’re like two blocks from my apartment,” Jen said. “If we crash, I’ll just walk home.”</span></p><p><span>“I’ll make sure you get the full impact,” Agatha threatened. “Don’t test me.” </span></p><p><span>Jen rolled her eyes. “</span><em><span>Anyway</span></em><span>,” she said, “are you gonna do it? Go out for drinks with Rio?”</span></p><p><span>“I’m leaning more toward the ice cream idea, actually,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>“Aren’t you lactose intolerant?”</span></p><p><span>“What’s your point?”</span></p><p><span>“You really wanna be gassy when things heat up with your girl?”</span></p><p><span>“I’ll take a Lactaid,” Agatha huffed. “And she’s not </span><em><span>my girl.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>“Deny all you want, girl. You and I both know the truth.”</span></p><p><span>“I hate you.”</span></p><p><span>Jen blew her a kiss.</span></p><p><span>Agatha flipped her off.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>An hour and a half later, she was driving toward Rio’s apartment, her stomach already twisting itself into knots – and they hadn’t even had the ice cream yet!</span></p><p><span>Agatha had texted Rio back as soon as she got through her front door, ten minutes after dropping Jen off with both middle fingers raised. Jen had blown her another kiss and laughed as she disappeared into her building. Agatha rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t fight the smile that pushed at the corners of her lips.</span></p><p><span>She’d texted Rio to ask if she knew of any good ice cream places, and Rio texted back a couple minutes later to let her know that there was a parlor around the corner from her apartment building that served handmade ice cream. They even had vegan options, she said, and it honestly tasted better than the full-dairy kind.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s heart had fluttered at that. Had she ever mentioned her lactose intolerance to Rio? If she had, she couldn’t recall. If she hadn’t, then how did Rio know? Was she just that observant? Was it only because she noticed that Agatha only took oatmilk in her coffee? Plenty of people without intolerances did that. </span></p><p><span>Besides, Agatha still ate pizza the night before, and she was pretty sure it had real cheese.</span></p><p><span>In all honesty, cheese and most dairy products didn’t bother her as much as straight milk did. Ice cream was usually hit or miss, too. </span></p><p><span>She still popped a Lactaid, just in case she decided to be reckless and go for one of the non-vegan options.</span></p><p><span>After setting a time and place to meet (outside Rio’s apartment, around seven), Agatha hopped in the shower and scrubbed every inch of her body practically raw. She was absolutely </span><em><span>covered</span></em><span> in dirt and muck and (apparently) manure. She used the expensive oils and soaps she typically saved for special occasions, dousing herself in more than she normally would have used, until she smelled like vanilla and cedarwood, inhaling the scents like a balm. She used some kind of fancy conditioner Jen had gotten her that was supposed to ‘enhance’ her curls. It had been sitting under Agatha’s sink for the better part of the last year, but she finally cracked it open, wondering if it would add some kind of shine or volume to her hair.</span></p><p><span>She shaved. </span></p><p><span>Not a lot. No woman would ever make her go bare – she was </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> a preadolescent girl – but she trimmed and neatened and spent far too long trying to make everything symmetrical. Her fingers were pruny by the time she stepped out of the shower and she only had about half an hour to change into fresh clothes and dry her hair (which would definitely </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> get dry in that amount of time). It was still slightly damp as she slipped into a pair of jeans and a soft, light brown sweater with an embroidered leave pattern that shifted colors, from yellow to red to a darker brown. Underneath, she wore a simple red tee in case she got too warm.</span></p><p><span>It was still unseasonably warm for mid-October. </span></p><p><span>She slipped into her converse and grabbed a beanie to cover her drying hair (so as not to catch a cold) and slipped out of the house with her wallet and phone in her pocket and her keys hanging off one belt loop on a carabiner.</span></p><p><span>Rio answered the door before Agatha could even knock twice as though she’d been standing there the entire time. Agatha wanted to tease her about it, but she’d probably have done the same thing if the roles were reversed.</span></p><p><span>How had the best part of her life become seeing a woman that she’d known for so little time?</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Rio said, her cheeks slightly flushed as she gave Agatha a lopsided grin.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Agatha replied, matching her smile. She felt those butterflies spreading all over her body now. They filled her with a tingling warmth. She felt like a teenager again, crushing on some girl in her PE class.</span></p><p><span>Pathetic.</span></p><p><span>But she couldn’t seem to care when Rio’s gap was on full display, her cheeks adorably pink, her dark hair sticking out of a dark green slouchy beanie. She was wearing an orange sweater with the words “Pumpkin Spice and Everything Nice” stitched across it in swoopy handwriting and a pair of dark wash skinny jeans. Her green converse complimented Agatha’s (thank you, color theory) and were just as well-worn.</span></p><p><span>She smelled like Irish Spring, obviously having just taken a shower.</span></p><p><span>Agatha caught herself staring and blinked her eyes, clearing her throat as she refocused her attention…on Rio’s sweater.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t take you for a pumpkin spice kinda girl,” Agatha said, motioning at the sweater. It was funny and cute. It definitely matched Rio’s usual humorous taste in clothing.</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Rio said, glancing down as if remembering what she’d put on, “I’m not. This is Dulce’s. I figured she wouldn’t mind if I borrowed it for the night. It feels fitting for today, don’t you think?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha had to agree. </span></p><p><span>“So,” she asked as Rio stepped out of the apartment, turning to lock the door, “where is this ice cream place?”</span></p><p><span>“Around the corner,” Rio replied, “like I said. You’re gonna love it. It’s been around for </span><em><span>ages</span></em><span>, since well before Dulce and I moved in here. We actually went there for dinner the day we officially moved in.”</span></p><p><span>“They serve other things besides ice cream?” Agatha asked.</span></p><p><span>“Nope!” Rio replied with a grin, finally turning fully to Agatha as she clipped her carabiner onto her jeans. “A little ice cream for dinner never hurt anybody though.”</span></p><p><span>Once again, Agatha had to agree. After all, that’s what she was having for dinner tonight, wasn’t she?</span></p><p><span>“Ready to go?” she asked, mainly out of formality, turning in the direction of the exit to the building.</span></p><p><span>“Just one more thing,” Rio said. </span></p><p><span>Agatha was about to ask what else she needed (she’d just locked her apartment door, after all) when she felt a hand grasp her elbow and tug her back around, spinning on her heel and nearly falling over. Thankfully, Rio caught her.</span></p><p><span>With both her hands…and her lips.</span></p><p><span>Agatha barely registered the hand cupping her cheek or the other arm binding around her waist as the heat spread from where Rio’s lips brushed hers – gently at first, then more firmly as she began to respond, a moan slipping from her lips involuntarily as her hands came to rest on Rio’s hips. Agatha leaned in closer, her fingers clutching at Rio’s sweater, tugging her body more closely as their lips continued to brush, electricity generating between them.</span></p><p><span>But then it was over.</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled back, stumbling a bit against her apartment door as she swallowed thickly and breathed heavily. She reached for her cane, which she had placed against the doorknob, and pressed her opposite hand to her kiss-swollen lips, shuddering out a breath and giving Agatha a shaky smile.</span></p><p><span>“Now I’m ready,” she said, making her way toward the door. </span></p><p><span>Agatha just stared at her for a long moment, in stunned silence. </span></p><p><span>Rio made it all the way to the automatic doors and paused, looking back over her shoulder. Agatha must have looked completely stunned because Rio grinned at her, lifting her brows like she wasn’t just as wrecked by that kiss.</span></p><p><span>“You coming?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, face flushing as she rushed to catch up. Rio didn’t move; she just waited patiently until Agatha was at her side. Then she reached out, nudging Agatha’s fingers with her own.</span></p><p><span>Agatha wasted no time in accepting Rio’s hand, linking their fingers between them with a shy smile as they walked through the automatic doors together, meeting the chill of the evening with the warmth of each other’s hands. </span></p>

<p><b>Chapter Thirteen</b></p><p><span>There were 23 flavors to choose from at </span><em><span>Wicked Licks</span></em><span>. </span></p><p><span>Agatha chose two: cotton candy and strawberry mango swirl. The latter was on top on her cone, beneath a mountain of marshmallow sauce and a cherry.</span></p><p><span>“You have strange taste, you know that?” Rio teased as she hobbled in front of Agatha, leading her out into the plaza just outside the ice cream parlor, where there were benches and picnic tables. </span></p><p><span>There were already families and teens enjoying their own Sunday evening treats beneath strings of fairy lights. There was a gazebo in the center of it all, where a bunch of teen girls were draped over the railings and each other, mostly on their cell phones as they chatted idly. Some had boba tea and others had milkshakes or orders of fries from a nearby burger joint. Rio recognized a letterman jacket from the local high school on a girl with impossibly long, gangly legs sitting next to a bubbly redheaded girl who was telling some story gesturing wildly with her boba cup. </span></p><p><span>The jock girl was mooning at her, running her hand through her short, dark hair.</span></p><p><span>Rio just grinned at them as she and Agatha sat down on a bench.</span></p><p><span>“I prefer eclectic,” Agatha said, taking a lick of her ice cream. “It sounds way better.” There was a spot of marshmallow on her upper lip. “Besides, all </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> got was chocolate.” She motioned toward the cup of ice cream in Rio’s hand, which had one scoop of chocolate peanut butter and one of rocky road. They were both drowned in hot fudge and chocolate sprinkles.</span></p><p><span>Rio looked down at her ice cream and shrugged, scooping a little bit of each on her spoon. “I like chocolate,” she said, taking a bite. “Besides,” she continued with her mouth full of ice cream, “they’re different flavors. One has peanut butter mixed in and the other has almonds and marshmallow.” She swallowed. “Different.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s all chocolate,” Agatha said. “And it’s giving you a mustache.” She handed Rio a napkin with a smirk.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t need that,” Rio said, waving it off. She swiped her tongue over her upper lip, tasting the chocolate that must have smeared there when she took a bite of her ice cream. She flattened her tongue against her upper lip, trying to get as much of the chocolate as possible in one attempt. “Did I get it?” she asked Agatha.</span></p><p><span>“Um…” Agatha said, her cheeks a little pink and her blue eyes a little wide. “Not really,” she said. “I actually think you might have made the problem worse. Here, let me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached out again, holding the napkin. Rio swallowed thickly, but she didn’t pull back when Agatha swiped the napkin across her upper lip, her brows furrowing in concentration as she wiped away the chocolate from Rio’s mouth. Rio was pretty sure her face was beet red and prayed that the dim lights of the courtyard didn’t out her in that regard. Agatha’s hand was warm, even beneath the napkin, and smelled like something flowery – probably some kind of hand lotion she was wearing, or perfume.</span></p><p><span>Rio liked it.</span></p><p><span>When Agatha finally pulled back, she balled up the dirty napkin and tossed it into a nearby trash can.</span></p><p><span>“Better now?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>“Much,” Agatha confirmed. “There’s still a line of chocolate at the corners of your lips, but there’s nothing to be done about it now. Besides, you’ll probably have a chocolate goatee by the time you’re done with your ice cream, anyway.”</span></p><p><span>“That could be cool,” Rio said. “I could look like an evil mastermind.” She gave her best impression of an evil laugh, and Agatha just rolled her eyes, but her smile was fond.</span></p><p><span>“You’re such a goof,” she said, licking her own ice cream.</span></p><p><span>“Consequence of the trade, I’m afraid,” Rio said, taking another spoonful of her ice cream. “Hey,” she said, mouth half full, “look at that: I’m a poet, and I didn’t even know I was rhyming those words.” She gave Agatha a wide grin, but Agatha just squinted at her, a half-smile on her face. “That was a Brooklyn Nine-Nine reference, by the way.”</span></p><p><span>“Never seen it,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>“What? Seriously?!” Rio tutted, shaking her head. “You’re zero for two on the </span><em><span>brilliant</span></em><span> sitcom front! Tell me you’ve at</span><em><span> least</span></em><span> seen </span><em><span>The Good Place</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha just blinked at her.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Rio said. “Fourth date idea: vegging on my couch, bingeing as many episodes of various sitcoms as we can finish in a roughly…twelve-hour period.” </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fourth</span></em><span> date?” Agatha asked, tilting her head curiously. “Pray tell, what were the first three dates?”</span></p><p><span>“Seriously?” Rio snorted. “You don’t know?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, but there was a ghost of a smile on her lips that she tried to cover up with more licks from her ice cream, which was starting to melt even with the late Autumn chill in the air.</span></p><p><span>“Well, the first date,” Rio said, “was obviously the coffee shop and museum the other day. That’s the very definition of a cute date, especially for lesbians.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay, fair,” Agatha said, holding up her thumb as she took another lick of her ice cream. “What was the second date?”</span></p><p><span>“Last night?” Rio said, like it was obvious. “The show, the drinks, that </span><em><span>god-awful</span></em><span> culinary crime? Definitely a date.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took another slow, thoughtful, lick of her ice cream (and Rio pretended that she wasn’t fighting not to stare at the slow drag of her tongue) and nodded, holding up her pointer finger. “Accepted,” she said. “And the third?”</span></p><p><span>“Uh…right now?” Rio said, snorting. “Unless…is this not a date?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shrugged, blushing. “</span><em><span>You</span></em><span> invited </span><em><span>me,</span></em><span>” she reminded her. “Did you mean for this to be a date?”</span></p><p><span>“Well…yeah,” Rio said, looking down at her ice cream. It was becoming chocolate soup from the warmth of her hand around the cup. She stirred it a little bit with her spoon. “I mean, if you want it to be.”</span></p><p><span>She felt fingers under her chin, pushing it up until she was face to face with Agatha again. Agatha was smiling, her face closer now. “Then,” she said, her voice low as she stared Rio in the eye, “it’s a date.” </span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed thickly and felt herself lean in. When Agatha didn’t pull back, Rio kept going until their lips were almost brushing. Then she stopped, searching Agatha’s eyes, waiting for her to close the gap. She had been the one to initiate the last kiss after all; it was Agatha’s turn to initiate the next one.</span></p><p><span>And she did.</span></p><p><span>This kiss was soft and tentative, but no less electric than their last kiss had been. Agatha’s lips were a warm contrast to the chill in the air. They tasted like her strawberry mango ice cream, sweet and fruity. The marshmallow also made them a little sticky, but Rio didn’t mind one bit. She used her free hand to cradle the back of Agatha’s head, catching some of her hair, tangling her fingers in the soft curls. Agatha’s hand stayed under Rio’s chin, holding her in place (though it was not needed) as they kissed. </span></p><p><span>When the need for air became more pressing than the need for Agatha’s lips to stay firmly pressed to her own, Rio pulled away, inhaling the cool air through her nose in a frankly dramatic inhale. </span></p><p><span>“Whoa,” she said, panting as she leaned back on the bench’s armrest.</span></p><p><span>“Agreed,” Agatha replied, chuckling as she leaned back, pushing her hair behind her ear. She was smiling shyly as she looked down at her lap, holding onto her ice cream, which was now…lopsided?</span></p><p><span>Rio narrowed her eyes at the ice cream cone, then looked down at her (sister’s) sweater. “Shit!” she exclaimed, staring at the big pink and orange glob of ice cream that was now staining the front of it. “Shit!” She reached for one of Agatha’s napkins and started trying to clean the ice cream off. Agatha watched her with wide eyes.</span></p><p><span>“Dulce is gonna kill me,” Rio groaned when she’d done all she could do to remove the stain (aka not much at all). </span></p><p><span>“You could tell her I did it,” Agatha suggested. “Then she might not be so mad.”</span></p><p><span>“You know, I would be insulted by the notion,” Rio retorted, “if that wasn’t so accurate. Thanks.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted, taking another lick of her ice cream. </span></p><p><span>They ate their ice cream in silence for a while, trading shy glances and smiles. Their knees were brushing now as their bodies tilted toward each other. Rio felt warmth and electricity every time their joints brushed. She swallowed thickly, the chocolate and peanut butter making her tongue feel like it was sticking to the roof of her mouth, but she was certain that that was just the nerves. </span></p><p><span>She glanced across the courtyard to where the teens were still scattered around the gazebo. The redhead was now wearing the brunette’s letterman jacket, leaving the latter in just a gray henley under a blue plaid flannel. She was sharing sips of her milkshake with the redhead, who offered sips of her boba in return. They kept blushing every time they shared a look longer than a second.</span></p><p><em><span>Adorable</span></em><span>, Rio thought. She hadn’t had many girlfriends in high school. She was basically raising her own kid at the time, so that wasn’t too odd. But there were girls who didn’t mind having a little kid tag along on walks or to the diner for their dates. Nothing serious ever came out of those dates, but at least they were nice to Dulce, for the most part.</span></p><p><span>She’d barely even been out in high school. Well, she wasn’t wearing any pride pins, anyway. It was more of an open secret and never something that she’d denied. She’d always reacted more positively to girls hitting on her than guys. She’d preen when girls gave her compliments and show off her skills on the court when girls she’d liked were watching. If any guys expressed interest in her, she glared at them or made disgusted faces until they went away.</span></p><p><span>Immature? Sure, but she didn’t want to give any guy false hope.</span></p><p><span>And she didn’t want any interested girl getting the wrong idea.</span></p><p><span>It was harder to be out and proud back then, but those who knew her preferences weren’t cruel assholes at the very least. She didn’t really know how her parents would have felt about it, but she’d never really told them.</span></p><p><span>Dulce knew from the start, so it was rather normal to her.</span></p><p><span>Now, though, it’s easier to be out and proud, like the girls across the way. The redhead leaned into the brunette’s shoulder, giggling at something that was whispered intimately into her ear. She pressed her face into the brunette’s neck and wrapped her arms around her waist as the brunette wrapped her own arm loosely around the redhead’s shoulders and pressed a kiss to her temple. Any visible skin on the redhead’s face and neck instantly turned pink and her hold on the brunette tightened.</span></p><p><span>Rio found herself smiling fondly at them.</span></p><p><span>“They’re cute,” Agatha said next to her. Rio blinked at her as if having forgotten that she was there.</span></p><p><span>She cleared her throat. “Yeah,” she said, her voice a little rough, cheeks a little pink. “They are.”</span></p><p><span>“I wish I could have had that,” Agatha murmured, looking at the two girls cuddling and sharing their drinks. “But I was kind of a loser in high school.”</span></p><p><span>Rio scoffed. “I doubt that,” she said.</span></p><p><span>“No, it’s true,” Agatha said. “I was the weird lesbian girl with dyed hair and paint on my jeans. I hung out in the art room with other losers, all of us too shy to ask each other out. Not that I really liked any of the other girls that hung out in the art room, anyway. I was into the–” Her eyes widened and her cheeks went red suddenly, her mouth clamping shut. She took more licks of her ice cream as if she hadn’t just been in the middle of a sentence.</span></p><p><span>Rio narrowed her eyes. “What?” she asked. “What were you going to say?”</span></p><p><span>“Nothing,” Agatha said, continuing to lick her ice cream as she avoided Rio’s eyes. The mango strawberry was nothing but a memory at this point (so much of it had ended up on Rio’s sweater during their kiss) and she was quickly making her way through the cotton candy scoop at the bottom of her cone, turning her lips blue. She cleared her throat as she could practically feel Rio’s gaze on the side of her face. </span></p><p><span>She took a big chomp of the ice cream to distract herself, but it backfired royally when she suddenly had a piercing headache stab through her skull like an ice pick. Agatha nearly dropped the cone as she grabbed her head with her free hand, wincing as the ice cream headache rattled her skull.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Rio said, reaching out. “Are you okay?”</span></p><p><span>“Brain freeze,” Agatha grunted, squeezing her eyes shut tight. “I’m okay. Just need a minute.”</span></p><p><span>“Press your thumb to the roof of your mouth,” Rio said, gently removing the ice cream cone from her hand. “It’ll help.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded and did as she was told, keeping her eyes closed until the pain started to dissipate. When she opened them again, she caught Rio mid-lick in her ice cream cone, eyes wide when caught.</span></p><p><span>“Uh…” Rio said at Agatha’s lifted eyebrow. “Sorry.” She flushed. “I’ve never had cotton candy ice cream before. It’s pretty good.” She handed back the cone.</span></p><p><span>“It is,” Agatha agreed, licking the ice cream right over where Rio’s tongue had been just moments before. She swore she could taste her lips. She watched as Rio cheeks went even more pink, but she pretended not to notice. “It’s been my favorite since I was eight.”</span></p><p><span>“Ooh, more Agatha lore?” Rio said, leaning forward, eyes twinkling. “Please spill.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted, shaking her head. “There’s not much to tell,” she said. “I didn’t get ice cream much when I was with my mom. Gran was the only one who ever let me have it. At first, the choice was between chocolate and vanilla, you know? The two most basic, simple flavors in the world.” She looked a little guilty. “I preferred vanilla.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gasped, dramatically. “Betrayal,” she whispered, but she motioned for Agatha to continue all the same.</span></p><p><span>Agatha chuckled. “For my eighth birthday – the first one I had living with my gran – we went to an amusement park. We rode all the rides and played games. I won a giant stuffed dog that was twice my size and dragged it around the park. It was great.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, remembering the doberman plush that wouldn’t fit in her grandmother’s car, so they had to tie it to the roof with bungee cords. She’d named it Thor and it sat in the corner of her bedroom for over a year, protecting her while she slept. At some point, though, she’d outgrown it.</span></p><p><span>She kind of wished she’d kept it. She wondered where Thor was now.</span></p><p><span>Not the point.</span></p><p><span>“At the end of the day,” Agatha continued, “while we were walking toward the exit, we saw this ice cream stand. Gran said that all good birthday girls deserved ice cream. And she said I’d been </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> good that day.” Agatha preened a little, remembering how great it felt just to be called ‘good’. “So we went up to the guy at the ice cream stand and asked for a vanilla cone. He said they didn’t serve ‘plain old vanilla’ though.”</span></p><p><span>“Uh oh,” Rio said, smirking as she listened to the story, idly sipping spoonfuls of her ice cream. “Were you upset?”</span></p><p><span>“Naturally,” Agatha said. “I was eight. But then my gran said to just pick a different flavor. She handed me this little laminated menu that the guy had a stack of. It had over a dozen flavors. I was…taken aback. All I’d known up to that point was chocolate and vanilla, and now suddenly there were over a </span><em><span>dozen</span></em><span> flavors? It’s like the world got bigger right at that very second.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha remembered holding the menu, reading the swoopy gold lettering, and trying to make sense of what she was seeing. Surely, this couldn’t be real. Surely, she was just dreaming. She’d wake up any second, probably in her mother’s house, and there would only be two ice cream flavors in the whole world again. </span></p><p><span>But she blinked.</span></p><p><span>And then she blinked again.</span></p><p><span>And the world stayed just the same. </span></p><p><span>Gran and the ice cream man were still there in front of her, waiting for her to choose an ice cream flavor. The man seemed to be getting impatient, but Gran was giving her an easy smile, understanding like she knew the kind of paradigm shift her granddaughter was going through.</span></p><p><span>“I just chose a flavor at random,” Agatha said. “They all looked really good, but I could tell that I was starting to take too long. Besides, I knew that I liked cotton candy, so I figured that would be a safe bet.” She shrugged, blushing, as she looked down at her rapidly melting ice cream. “And…that’s it. I just started liking – </span><em><span>loving</span></em><span> – cotton candy ice cream from that day. I still get the occasional vanilla, but this is where my heart lies.” She took another lick of her ice cream cone and glanced up at Rio, who was giving her a look of pure adoration.</span></p><p><span>“That was the </span><em><span>cutest</span></em><span> fucking story I’ve ever heard,” she said, reaching out to place her hand on Agatha’s knee. “Please tell me you have pictures of little Agatha on her eighth birthday.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “Unfortunately,” she said, “I think that’s a </span><em><span>fifth</span></em><span> date thing.”</span></p><p><span>“Damn,” Rio said, snapping her fingers. “Well, I can wait. I’m incredibly patient, you know.”</span></p><p><span>“I feel like Dulce would have something to say about that.”</span></p><p><span>“Dulce is a habitual liar and should not be trusted,” Rio replied, taking more sips of her ice cream. “Unless, of course, she says something nice about me.”</span></p><p><span>“Of course,” Agatha snorted, shaking her head.</span></p><p><span>Rio kept her hand on Agatha’s knee as she continued to drink the rest of her ice cream. Agatha didn’t say anything about it as she finished her cone.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As they got up to leave, Rio glanced back at the teens in the gazebo, who were also starting to head out. The redhead started to hand back the letterman jacket, but the brunette waved her off, saying something that Rio couldn’t quite make out, but it made the redhead flush as she pulled the jacket more tightly around her. The brunette tentatively took her hand and linked their fingers.</span></p><p><span>They both flushed as the girls around them teased them about it. The brunette gave the finger to their friends as she tugged the redhead out of the gazebo and down a path toward the sidewalk. Rio watched as the redhead leaned into her as they walked, laying her head on the brunette’s shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“Ready?” Agatha asked, interrupting Rio’s thoughts. </span></p><p><span>Rio turned to see Agatha holding out her cane for her. Rio took it and nodded. “Yeah,” she said. “Thanks.”</span></p><p><span>She took the cane in her right hand, as always, and then reached for Agatha’s with her left hand, the move feeling as natural as breathing as she linked their fingers between them. Agatha spared her a glance, smiling shyly as they walked together toward the street.</span></p><p><span>They passed the teen couple, who both gave them shy – but very happy – smiles. Rio nodded at the brunette, who nodded back with a lopsided grin, pulling her girl in closer.</span></p><p><span>“They’re cute,” Agatha murmured, looking over her shoulder at them. “Love that for them.”</span></p><p><span>“I bet you’ve never even seen </span><em><span>Schitt’s Creek</span></em><span>, either,” Rio teased, knocking Agatha’s shoulder a little.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve seen a few clips,” Agatha defended. “I like Alexis. She’s funny.”</span></p><p><span>“Agreed,” Rio said. “I’m adding that to the list.”</span></p><p><span>“How long is this list?” Agatha groaned, theatrically.</span></p><p><span>“Not very long,” Rio admitted, “but it’s gonna take a while to work through it, anyway. Many, </span><em><span>many</span></em><span> dates in our future.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha was silent for a long time, and Rio was afraid that she’d pushed too far. Put too much pressure on her. Moved too quickly.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha’s fingers tightened around hers.</span></p><p><span>“That sounds acceptable,” she said. “So long as </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> get to add a few of my own options to this ‘list’. I’m more of a movie-watcher, by the way.”</span></p><p><span>“What kinds of movies?” Rio asked. </span></p><p><span>They turned the corner onto her street. She could see her building up ahead, and she was </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> keen to get back to it too quickly. She didn’t want this night to end.</span></p><p><span>“Good ones,” Agatha said. “I’ll text you a list and you just tell me which ones you’ve already seen. Then we’ll go from there.”</span></p><p><span>“Deal,” Rio snorted. “I’m mostly into older movies, just so you know. Like </span><em><span>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</span></em><span> type of movies.”</span></p><p><span>“There have been a lot of great comedies since then,” Agatha said. “You need to keep up with the times, clown girl.”</span></p><p><span>Rio let out a bark of a laugh. “</span><em><span>Clown girl</span></em><span>?” she snorted. </span></p><p><span>“Is a comedian not a clown?” Agatha asked, grinning. “Just in another font.”</span></p><p><span>“You are ridiculous,” Rio said, affectionately.</span></p><p><span>“I am correct,” Agatha rebutted, but she was laughing. Rio squeezed her hand and Agatha pressed her shoulder to Rio’s. </span></p><p><span>They reached the front of Rio’s building, and Rio reached for her key fob, balancing it in her hand with her cane so that she wouldn’t have to release Agatha’s hand. </span></p><p><span>It worked as well as one might expect, but at least the doors opened and Agatha’s fingers were still wrapped securely around her own. </span></p><p><span>They made their way inside, walking slowly so as to extend the time they had together, but the downside of having an apartment only fifty feet inside the front entrance of the building is that, no matter how slowly you walk, you’ll still make it there sooner rather than later.</span></p><p><span>At Rio’s door, she turned toward Agatha, their hands still connected. She swallowed thickly as she looked into Agatha’s eyes, which were still the clearest blue she’d ever seen – like one of those lakes where you could see all the way to the bottom they were so clear and fathomless blue. She wanted to swim in those eyes.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in, placing her forehead against Agatha’s without even realizing it, but Agatha didn’t attempt to pull away. Instead, she placed one hand on Rio’s waist, which sent a shiver up Rio’s spine.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t want the night to end,” Rio murmured.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled at that. “Neither do I,” she admitted. She took a deep breath through her nose. “Invite me in,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s entire body lit up in flames at the request. She nodded and opened her mouth to do just that when the apartment door opened.</span></p><p><span>Rio and Agatha jumped a bit, their foreheads moving away from each other, though their tangled fingers kept them from moving too far.</span></p><p><span>Dulce stood there, her eyes a little bit red as she sniffled and looked between them. Rio gave her a concerned look, about to ask what was wrong and why she had obviously been crying when the younger girl’s eyes narrowed at them, then zeroed in on the stain on her sweater.</span></p><p><span>“Okay, I have </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> many questions,” Dulce said, her voice a little bit thick. She cleared her throat. “Firstly, who said you could take and then </span><em><span>ruin</span></em><span> my favorite sweater? You’re paying to get that dry-cleaned.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha did it!” Rio blurted.</span></p><p><span>“Rio!” Agatha huffed, letting go of her hand to hit her on the shoulder. </span></p><p><span>Rio grimaced as Dulce chortled.</span></p><p><span>“Wow,” she said, “immediately threw your girlfriend under the bus. Real mature, dude.”</span></p><p><span>Rio opened her mouth to say something about Agatha </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> being her girlfriend, but then she paused, glancing sideways at her. </span></p><p><span>This was their third date. They were planning ‘many more’ just to watch a bunch of TV shows together. They had kissed at least three times. Rio was about to invite her inside when her little cockblock of a baby sister interrupted (</span><em><span>again</span></em><span>) and ruined her plans.</span></p><p><span>What plans? Even Rio didn’t know, but that wasn’t important.</span></p><p><span>The point was that </span><em><span>Dulce</span></em><span> had ruined them, and she would have to pay for it.</span></p><p><span>“Secondly,” Dulce said, wiping her nose, “how the hell did </span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span> – hi, Agatha – ruin </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> sweater while </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> were wearing it?”</span></p><p><span>“Hello, Dulce,” Agatha replied with a chuckle. She looked at Rio. “Yes, how </span><em><span>did</span></em><span> I get ice cream on the sweater you were wearing?”</span></p><p><span>“Not in a way my baby sister should really hear about,” Rio huffed, flushing and hunching her shoulders. “Nor do I think you really </span><em><span>want</span></em><span> to hear about the makeout session we had, do you?”</span></p><p><span>“Rio!” Agatha hit her shoulder again.</span></p><p><span>“Gross!” Dulce groaned, wrinkling her nose.</span></p><p><span>“Am I wrong?” Rio huffed. “Anyway, what’s wrong? Why are you all sniffly? Do I need to go beat somebody up?”</span></p><p><span>“Like you could,” Dulce snorted.</span></p><p><span>“I am lethal with this cane,” Rio retorted. “Don’t test me. Was it Jen? I’ll beat her ass.” She glanced at Agatha. “You guys have good insurance at the museum, right?”</span></p><p><span>“Jen’s rich, anyway,” Agatha informed her. “I’ll help.”</span></p><p><span>“I appreciate that,” Dulce said, “but this wasn’t Jen.” She sniffled again. “I actually need your advice about something.” Her eyes pleaded with Rio, who softened.</span></p><p><span>“Of course,” she said. “Anything. You know that.”</span></p><p><span>Dulce nodded, then looked at Agatha. “Yours, too,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes widened and she just pointed at herself. “Me? You need </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> advice.”</span></p><p><span>“Need as many experts as possible,” Dulce said. “Please?”</span></p><p><span>“Um, yeah,” Agatha said, glancing sideways at a confused Rio. “Sure.”</span></p><p><span>Dulce stepped aside and ushered them both into the apartment. Swan and Reaper rubbed themselves against their shins. Rio reached down, stroking between Reaper’s shoulder blades. Agatha scratched beneath Swan’s chubby chin, smiling as the cats purred. </span></p><p><span>Rio led her toward the L-shaped couch and settled herself in the corner, tugging Agatha to sit close to her. Agatha smiled as she settled against Rio’s side. Dulce sat a few seats away, holding a pillow to her chest. Rio immediately noticed the used tissues scattered around them like oversized confetti.</span></p><p><span>“What’s going on?” she asked, leaning toward her sister.</span></p><p><span>Dulce sniffled again. “Morgan…kissed me,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyebrows went all the way up at that. “She finally made a move?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>“Finally?” Dulce asked. “You knew she liked me?”</span></p><p><span>“I’m shocked that </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> didn’t,” Rio said. “I thought it was obvious.”</span></p><p><span>“Obvious to </span><em><span>whom</span></em><span>?” Dulce asked.</span></p><p><span>“You </span><em><span>would</span></em><span> use whom right now,” Rio snorted. “Nerd.”</span></p><p><span>“Rio!”</span></p><p><span>“Sorry,” Rio said, clearing her throat. “Um, I think it’s obvious to anybody with eyes, really. Morgan’s been crushing on you since she was, like, sixteen.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh my God,” Dulce whined. She shoved her face into the pillow and her shoulders shook with sobs.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes widened and she scooted toward her. “Hey, hey,” she said, gently. “It’s okay. Did you…did something bad happen after she kissed you? Did you sprint?”</span></p><p><span>“Sprint?” Agatha asked. “Like run away? Who runs away after something like that?”</span></p><p><span>“I did once,” Rio admitted, blushing.</span></p><p><span>Agatha considered her for a moment, trying to figure out if she was joking. “Seriously?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>“I was fifteen!” Rio defended. “It was a guy.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, okay then,” Agatha said. “Understandable.”</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” Rio said. She turned back to Dulce. “Did you sprint?”</span></p><p><span>“No, unfortunately,” Dulce said. “I did not. My legs stopped working.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t even joke about that, dude,” Rio said, holding up her cane.</span></p><p><span>“It’s not a joke!” Dulce said, more tears streaking down her face. “I legit couldn’t move! Morgan…</span><em><span>kissed</span></em><span> me and I just stood there like an idiot for a full minute.” She sniffled again. “I was like a freaking statue, just standing there in shock.”</span></p><p><span>“How did Morgan react to that?” Agatha asked, her voice soft and understanding.</span></p><p><span>“Not well,” Dulce said, motioning to her face. “Obviously.” She swallowed thickly. “She asked if she’d done something wrong, if she’d misread the signs.”</span></p><p><span>“Did she?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>For as long as she’d known her sister, Dulce had never really expressed an interest in girls. Or boys, really. Celebrities, for the most part, yeah, but those were always hypotheticals and they didn’t really last that long, anyway. Dulce focused on her studies and then her work. She didn’t express an interest in anybody.</span></p><p><span>Hell, Rio hadn’t even known about the one and only boyfriend Dulce had apparently had in high school (a boy she was still planning to murder the next time she saw him). </span></p><p><span>“That’s the thing,” Dulce said, still sniffling as more tears ran down her cheeks, “I don’t </span><em><span>know</span></em><span>.” She swiped at her eyes. “I thought we were just friends, that I treated her just like I would any other friend. But Morgan thought…she thought that I </span><em><span>liked</span></em><span> her. Like…romantically.” She swallowed thickly. “I feel like I led her on.”</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t,” Rio said, firmly.</span></p><p><span>“But what if I–”</span></p><p><span>“Were you </span><em><span>trying</span></em><span> to flirt with her?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>“No…” Dulce said, sniffling. </span></p><p><span>“Did you want her to kiss you?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>“No,” Dulce said, definitively. “But what if she thought–”</span></p><p><span>“What she thought is irrelevant,” Rio said, firmly, “because that wasn’t your intention. Her misconstruing things when all you were doing was treating her like the friend she is is not your fault, </span><em><span>mi vida</span></em><span>.” She reached out, swiping a tear away from Dulce’s cheek. “You can apologize for the misunderstanding, but her acting on a wrong assumption is not your fault.”</span></p><p><span>“But what if I </span><em><span>was</span></em><span> being flirty?” Dulce asked, her face small and her eyes big and watery. “What if I </span><em><span>was</span></em><span> making her think that I liked her back?” She sniffled. “I mean, we always kind of </span><em><span>joke</span></em><span>-flirted. What if I made her think that it was </span><em><span>real</span></em><span>? Wouldn’t that be </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> fault?”</span></p><p><span>“Does she know you’re straight?” Agatha asked.</span></p><p><span>Dulce let out a deep breath. “</span><em><span>I</span></em><span> don’t even know if I’m straight,” she admitted. “But I’ve always just let people assume…”</span></p><p><span>“So then it’s </span><em><span>not your fault</span></em><span>,” Rio said, even as she tabled that new information for later. Now was not the time to parse out her little sister’s sexuality. “What did you say to Morgan after it happened?”</span></p><p><span>“I could barely speak,” Dulce said. “I said that I was sorry, that I didn’t feel that way about her, that she was a really good friend.”</span></p><p><span>“Oof,” Agatha said, “I’ve heard that all before. A lesbian’s first heartbreak.” She squeezed Dulce’s knee. “She’s going to be just fine. Just give her a little time.”</span></p><p><span>Dulce swallowed thickly. “Are you sure?” she asked. </span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded. “I had a crush on a girl on the soccer team when I was in high school,” she informed her.</span></p><p><span>“The soccer team?” Rio asked, eyes widening.</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha sighed, “the soccer team. I was </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> certain that this girl was gay. She wore flannels and cut her hair really short and smiled at me a lot. I figured she knew that </span><em><span>I </span></em><span>was gay and was trying to subtly let me know that I was into her.” </span></p><p><span>“But she wasn’t?” Dulce guessed.</span></p><p><span>“Bingo,” Agatha said. “I asked her out to a movie and she gave me this look like I was just…the most disgusting creature she’d ever seen in her life and said ‘sorry, I’m not a lesbo’ and practically sprinted away from me.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, shit,” Dulce said.</span></p><p><span>“What a fucking bitch,” Rio added, wrapping her arm around Agatha and pulling her against her body.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shrugged. “I’m fine. Hurt like a bitch for a couple days, but I got over it. As long as you weren’t nearly as cruel as that bitch, though, I’m sure Morgan’s gonna be just fine.”</span></p><p><span>Dulce nodded. “I hope so,” she said. “She looked </span><em><span>really</span></em><span> upset when I turned her down.” She took a deep breath. “What if she never forgives me? I don’t want to lose her as a friend.”</span></p><p><span>“She’s just embarrassed,” Rio said. “You two will be back to giggling and talking about…whatever it is you two talk about in no time. You’ll see.” She reached out, rubbing Dulce’s back soothingly. “Everything’s going to be okay, you’ll see.”</span></p><p><span>Dulce nodded. “Thanks,” she said. She stood up. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go edit the photos I just spent the last twenty-four hours taking. I probably won’t be coming out of that bedroom for at least twelve more, but, uh, keep the noise down.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh my god!” Rio huffed, tossing a pillow at Dulce as she ran out of the room. “What a little shit,” she murmured, laying back against the couch.</span></p><p><span>“Hey, you raised that little shit,” Agatha pointed out. </span></p><p><span>“Yeah, I did,” Rio said, grinning. “Anyway,” she cleared her throat, “do you wanna stick around for a bit? Maybe we could start that marathon.”</span></p><p><span>“That wasn’t exactly what I had in mind,” Agatha said, “when I asked you to invite me in tonight.” She settled on the cushion next to Rio, her legs draped over Rio’s lap.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s body buzzed. “Oh really?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>“Really,” Agatha purred, leaning in until their noses were brushing. </span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in, licking her lips, practically tasting Agatha’s.</span></p><p><span>But then Agatha leaned back. “But I think a TV marathon is a good alternative, don’t you?” She reached for the TV remote on the coffee table, and Rio almost whined out loud.</span></p><p><span>“Um, sure,” she said, trying to keep the disappointment out of her voice as Agatha handed her the remote. She turned on the TV and started flipping through their streaming services to pull up an episode of…something.</span></p><p><span>She couldn’t really focus with Agatha nuzzling against her neck like that. The remote almost slipped from her fingers. She felt Agatha’s lips over her pulse and was unable to suppress a moan.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio sighed, but she didn’t stop her as Agatha began to kiss a line up her neck. </span></p><p><span>“Just pick a show,” Agatha husked in her ear, “and I’ll do my best to pay attention.” She nipped at Rio’s jaw and Rio selected the first show she saw, the remote slipping from her fingers the instant after and clattering to the ground.</span></p><p><span>By that time, she and Agatha were already horizontal on the couch, Rio’s mouth practically fused with Agatha’s collarbone.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b>Chapter Fourteen</b></p><p><span>Agatha woke up with a sore…everything, really. There was something heavy on the left side of her body. Heavy but soft. Agatha’s arms were wrapped around it like a body pillow. It smelled sweet, too. Familiar.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes popped open. Above her was an unfamiliar ceiling. She turned her head to the right and groaned a little when her neck cracked. There was a coffee table with a remote perilously close to the edge and a cell phone that wasn’t hers. </span></p><p><span>On the other side of the coffee table, a pair of big green eyes were watching her, blinking slowly as they studied her. Agatha recognized that face.</span></p><p><span>She yawned, offering the cat a soft smile. “Good morning, Reaper,” she whispered.</span></p><p><span>Reaper let out a happy chirp in response. Despite her skeleton-like markings, she was a very bright, happy kitty. Agatha could hear her purring. She grinned as she started to push herself, only to be stopped by that soft, heavy weight over her left side. She looked down to see a head of tangled black hair over her chest.</span></p><p><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Rio had fallen asleep on her last night. After making out for…Agatha doesn’t even remember when they stopped making out. Rio had been a little handsy, feeling up Agatha’s hips and ass as her lips ran up and down Agatha’s throat, but they still had all their clothes on in the light of day.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately.</span></p><p><span>Agatha wouldn’t have been opposed to something </span><em><span>more</span></em><span>, obviously, but maybe it was for the best that they stayed clothed. After all, this was a common space that Rio shared with the sister she raised, so probably not the best place for a hook-up.</span></p><p><span>But, if they could have had the place all to themselves…</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook off the thought as her entire body warmed and she cleared her throat, her fingers moving through Rio’s hair, teasing the strands gently as she tried to work through the knots. </span></p><p><span>“Hey,” she whispered, leaning down to press a kiss to Rio’s forehead. “Rio?”</span></p><p><span>Rio moaned, cuddling more deeply against Agatha’s chest, practically forcing her face between her breasts. Agatha bit her lip and snorted. </span></p><p><span>“Babe,” she said. “Rio. I have to pee.”</span></p><p><span>“Hmm?” Rio mumbled, her head turning until she was looking Agatha in the eyes, her own half-lidded with fatigue and confusion. “Agatha? What are you doing here?”</span></p><p><span>“Being held against my will,” Agatha teased, brushing a few strands of dark hair away from Rio’s face and behind her ear. “I really need to use the bathroom and you’re resting on my bladder. Please let me go.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes widened at that, like she was suddenly awake, and she pushed up on her hands, backing away from Agatha as if burned, falling against the back of the couch. </span></p><p><span>“Sorry!” Rio said, flushed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha chuckled, swinging her legs off the couch and stretching her arms above her head. “It’s no problem, really,” she said. “I didn’t mind the cuddling. I just </span><em><span>really</span></em><span> need to go.” She pushed herself to her feet and took a step, then froze.</span></p><p><span>“What’s wrong?” Rio asked, rubbing the sleep from her eyes as she shifted to an upright position.</span></p><p><span>“Nothing,” Agatha said, reaching down to rub her left leg. “I think my leg’s just asleep.” It felt fuzzy, like it had the year prior, when she thought that her loss of sensation was all about the flu shot. She slapped her shin a few times and the fuzziness went away. “Uh, I think you sleeping right on top of me might have stopped the blood flow.”</span></p><p><span>“Sorry,” Rio said again.</span></p><p><span>“Like I said,” Agatha laughed, taking another step and breathing a sigh of relief when the fuzziness was mostly gone, “not a big deal. I like the cuddling. I’d love a repeat of it. Soon. But for right now…”</span></p><p><span>“The bathroom is the first door on the right,” Rio said, motioning down the hall.</span></p><p><span>“Thanks,” Agatha said, shooting an easy grin at her over her shoulders.</span></p><p><span>As soon as the bathroom door shut, that smile dropped. As she sat on the toilet, she massaged her leg and wiggled her toes, making sure the feeling was still there. She wondered how it had happened for Rio when her leg went numb. Was it something that happened all of a sudden? Was it gradual? Was there any kind of in between there?</span></p><p><span>Would that happen to Agatha eventually?</span></p><p><span>She tried to put it out of her mind as she washed her hands and splashed a little water on her face, using her sweater to dry it up. When she looked back into the mirror, her eyes widened at the red marks scattered along the column of her throat, which disappeared beneath the collar of her sweater. She blushed and pressed her hand over her mouth, suppressing her grin.</span></p><p><span>“Oh my God,” she huffed, shaking her head as she snorted. “I’m gonna kill her.”</span></p><p><span>No, she wasn’t. In fact, now she had to get even.</span></p><p><span>When Agatha made her way back into the living room, Rio wasn’t there. Reaper and Swan were, though, cuddling together on the vacated couch, probably soaking up what was left from the warmth that Agatha and Rio left behind.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s cane was still resting against the wall adjacent to the couch.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head at that and shuffled into the kitchen, where Rio was hobbling around, taking things out of the fridge and fiddling with a coffee maker. She was whistling a tune to herself as she cracked eggs and chopped vegetables and warmed a pan on an electric stove. Agatha just watched as she moved from the doorway, studying the stiff movements she made as she walked the short distance from counter to stove to fridge. She’d never really seen Rio walk without her cane before.</span></p><p><span>“You just going to stand there, watching me,” Rio said, “or are you gonna come get your breakfast?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes and snorted, walking into the kitchen to meet Rio at the counter. She was pouring the coffee into a mug. She grinned up at Agatha as she handed her a cup, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Agatha’s lips. Agatha sighed into her kiss, her shoulders relaxing as she wrapped her hands around the porcelain in Rio’s soft hands.</span></p><p><span>“There’s oat milk in the fridge,” Rio murmured against her lips. “Help yourself.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha bit back the ‘I love you’ that threatened to fall from her lips. She didn’t mean it like </span><em><span>that</span></em><span>. It was more of a hyperbolic phrase meant to convey her appreciation for having her non-dairy of choice on hand. Nothing more.</span></p><p><span>Obviously. It was too soon for that.</span></p><p><span>She wasn’t trying to scare Rio away even if she was just being facetious. </span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” she said instead, pressing another peck to Rio’s lips before making her way to the fridge to grab the carton of oat milk. </span></p><p><span>“No problem,” Rio replied. “Dulce loves the stuff, too, so we always have plenty. Especially when she steals the half-empty containers from her job at the end of her shifts.”</span></p><p><span>“What a little thief,” Agatha snorted.</span></p><p><span>“Who’s a thief?” Dulce asked, coming out of her room just next to the kitchen. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha’s stealing your oat milk,” Rio said, pointing her spatula at the other woman as Agatha gasped.</span></p><p><span>“Rio!” she huffed. “I’m sorry, Dulce,” she said, turning to the younger woman. “I was just–”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t worry about it,” Dulce snorted. “There’s plenty more where that came from and at least </span><em><span>somebody</span></em><span> is using it. Rio won’t even put it in her hot chocolate.”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t like it,” Rio moaned. “It tastes…oat-y.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re a child,” Dulce snorted.</span></p><p><span>“You literally have the babiest of baby faces,” Rio shot back, pushing the eggs around in the pan.</span></p><p><span>Dulce stuck out her tongue. Rio mirrored her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched them, sipping her coffee. </span><em><span>Fascinating</span></em><span>. She’d never had a sister, but this was her exact relationship with Jen, almost. </span></p><p><span>Rio finished the eggs and scooped them onto a plate while also heating up a flat pan and placing a couple of tortillas onto it. While they warmed, she hobbled back over to Agatha, wrapping her arms around her and pressing her face into the crook of her neck. Agatha found herself smiling softly as she took another sip of her coffee and wrapped her arm around Rio’s waist.</span></p><p><span>“No more marks,” Agatha said when she felt Rio’s lips brush against her pulse point.</span></p><p><span>“That’s not what you said last night,” Rio snickered. Agatha pinched her ass. “Hey! Not in front of the baby.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m a college graduate!” Dulce groaned, pouring herself a cup of coffee. “And </span><em><span>gross</span></em><span>, you two. Get a room.” She poured some oat milk into her mug and used a spoon to stir it.</span></p><p><span>“We tried that,” Rio shot back. “Last night.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh my God!” Dulce exclaimed, running straight back to her room and slamming the door shut while Rio cackled.</span></p><p><span>“You are a menace,” Agatha murmured against the rim of her coffee mug, but she couldn’t suppress her grin as she took a sip. Rio continued to nuzzle against her neck. “I’m serious: no more marks. Jen’s never going to let me hear the end of it.”</span></p><p><span>“She and Alice are practically on their way down the aisle already,” Rio retorted, scraping her teeth over one of the hickeys. Agatha gasped, her hand clenching on Rio’s sweater. She tried not to choke on her coffee as she lightly shoved Rio away. Rio gave her an exaggerated pout.</span></p><p><span>“Go check on your tortillas,” Agatha murmured, pushing her back toward the stove.</span></p><p><span>“Oh shit,” Rio said, stumbling toward the tortillas as though she’d forgotten about them entirely. She quickly flipped them, breathing a sigh of relief when the other side was only slightly black. She gave Agatha a thumbs up. Agatha snorted.</span></p><p><span>“Can you bring the plate of eggs to the table for me?” Rio asked, turning the tortillas in a circle on the pan before reaching into a nearby drawer and pulling out a colorful towel. </span></p><p><span>“Sure,” Agatha said, picking up the plate with the still-steaming eggs and bringing it to the tiny table in the corner, along with her coffee. “What’s with the tortillas?”</span></p><p><span>“You’ve never had a breakfast burrito before?” Rio asked, tossing the first two tortillas into the towel before tossing two more onto the pan.</span></p><p><span>“I have,” Agatha said. “Usually the frozen kind, from the grocery store.”</span></p><p><span>Rio let out a dramatic gasp. “You poor thing,” she said. </span></p><p><span>“I’ve had real ones, too,” Agatha huffed. “From delis. Usually contained bacon, as well.”</span></p><p><span>“Well, we don’t have bacon,” Rio said. “I made the last of it the other day. I need to go grocery shopping, actually.” She reached for another drawer and pulled out a pen, writing ‘BACON’ in big letters on a notepad attached to the fridge. “But the huevos a la mexicana should suffice.”</span></p><p><span>“But you’re puerto rican,” Agatha pointed out.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t name the eggs,” Rio snorted. “Though Dulce likes to add bits of plantain and call it ‘huevos a la puertorriqueña’ because she’s a big nerd.” She flipped the tortillas. “It’s a pretty basic dish, but it’s tasty. And it tastes really good on a tortilla.”</span></p><p><span>She turned off the burner and plucked the tortillas off, wrapping them in the towels. Then she moved stiffly toward the table, using the counter to stabilize herself.</span></p><p><span>“Should you be walking around without your cane?” Agatha asked after she tamped down the urge to get up and help her. Rio was disabled, but she was still a grown woman capable of asking for help when she needed it, she reminded herself. </span></p><p><span>“Lilia encourages it,” Rio said, nodding. “Especially when I’m in a familiar place with plenty of furniture to use as support.”</span></p><p><span>“Lilia?” Agatha asked.</span></p><p><span>“Dr. Calderu,” Rio clarified, sitting down.</span></p><p><span>“Right,” Agatha said. “I forgot she had a first name, too.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed at that, opening the towel and offering Agatha a tortilla. Agatha took the flat disc of bread and frowned. </span></p><p><span>“How do I do this?” she asked Rio.</span></p><p><span>“Hmm?” Rio asked, looking down at the tortilla in Agatha’s hand and… “Shit. Sorry. The forks.” She started to get up, but Agatha put her hand up to stop her.</span></p><p><span>“I’ll get them,” she said. “Where are they?”</span></p><p><span>“Drawer next to the sink,” Rio said. “Thanks.” </span></p><p><span>It took all of ten seconds for Agatha to locate the forks and bring them back to the table, handing one to Rio, who immediately started shoveling eggs into her tortilla. Agatha mimicked her, giving herself a generous helping of the eggs and folding the tortilla around them just as Rio did.</span></p><p><span>Somewhat.</span></p><p><span>While Rio’s burrito looked perfectly tucked and neat, Agatha’s had a tear with egg and peppers spilling out of it.</span></p><p><span>She shrugged. It was all going to the same place anyway, she thought as she took a big bite, humming at the flavor. It wasn’t spicy at all, but it wasn’t lacking in flavor. The peppers and onions had been cooked well, and the eggs were only just slightly runny, which Agatha liked.</span></p><p><span>“This is good,” Agatha said when she had swallowed most of it.</span></p><p><span>“Told you,” Rio said, grinning around her own bite of food. She finished chewing and swallowed, clearing her throat. “So,” she said, “what are your plans for the rest of the day?”</span></p><p><span>“Well, it’s Monday,” Agatha said. “So I have to go into the gallery for a bit. Then we have the group tonight.” She took another bite of her burrito.</span></p><p><span>“Right,” Rio said. “Um, about that…do you wanna…I mean, are we…” She pressed her lips together as her cheeks turned pink. She took another small nibble at her own burrito, looking pensive.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tilted her head in confusion as she chased her food with another sip of coffee. She swallowed. “Are you okay?” she asked. She’d never seen Rio look so flustered over…what, exactly? Nothing had really happened to make her this way, had it?</span></p><p><span>“I’m fine,” Rio insisted. “I just…are we going to tell the others?”</span></p><p><span>“About what?” </span></p><p><span>The words were out of her mouth before she even realized what she’d said. She watched Rio’s face fall and her shoulders droop. Her eyes dropped back down to the burrito in her hands. Agatha’s own eyes widened with realization and she opened her mouth to take back the words, to try to explain, but Rio shook her head.</span></p><p><span>“Right,” she said. “Nothing. It’s nothing.” She took another bite of her burrito, chewing silently. “Forget I said anything,” she said, the words slightly garbled through a mouthful of food.</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha said, desperate to fix this situation, “I–”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio said, giving Agatha an obviously forced smile, “it’s okay. I get it. It’s fine.” She cleared her throat. “It was fun, though.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha agreed. “Very fun. And I–”</span></p><p><span>“You don’t have to say anything, Agatha,” Rio insisted. “I get it. It’s fine.”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked closed off, like she wasn’t about to let Agatha get another word in, stubborn and obstinate and whatever other synonyms that she couldn’t think of right at the moment as she kept eating her burrito. Then she made another one and ate that, too, while Agatha continued to hold her own, suddenly not hungry anymore. She didn’t want her coffee, either, all the food seeming to turn in her stomach.</span></p><p><span>She placed her half-eaten burrito down on the half-empty plate of eggs and pushed herself away from the table. “I think I should go,” she said, her voice quiet and defeated.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” Rio said, still looking down at her food. </span></p><p><span>“I had a nice time last night, Rio,” Agatha said, trying to inject infection into her voice, praying that Rio would hear it. </span></p><p><span>The other woman still didn’t look up. “Me too,” she said. </span></p><p><span>She said nothing else.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed and padded back into the living room, locating her shoes, phone, and the beanie that Rio had knocked off her head at some point the night before, her fingers clenching around the hat as she remembered the feeling of Rio’s nails scratching her scalp, of her fingers running through her hair. She sighed and felt the burning in her nose and the corners of her eyes. She placed the hat back on her head and leaned down to give each cat a scritch behind the ears before she made her way to the door, not even bothering to call out a farewell as she left, her stomach churning.</span></p><p><span>If she hadn’t just eaten, she may have run all the way home immediately.</span></p><p><span>But her stupid car was there, parked on the street in front of Rio’s building.</span></p><p><span>There was a ticket on the windshield.</span></p><p><span>“Fucking perfect,” Agatha huffed, plucking it from beneath the windshield wipers and making her way to the driver’s side door. She got in, started the car, and immediately placed her forehead down on the wheel, making the horn beep shortly. Not that she cared.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Where’s Agatha?” </span></p><p><span>Rio paused in scrubbing the dish in her hands, but only for a second.</span></p><p><span>“She left,” she told her sister. “I saved you some eggs. They’re in the microwave.”</span></p><p><span>“Why’d she leave without you?” Dulce asked, opening the microwave and pulling out a plate made with two egg burritos. </span></p><p><span>“Why not?” Rio asked, trying to sound casual</span></p><p><span>Obviously she wasn’t very convincing by the way her sister paused with the plate in her hands and the microwave door still open, her brows furrowed as she stared her down. Rio tried not to blink, but Dulce’s eyes were piercing. She had to look away.</span></p><p><span>“Jesus,” Rio huffed. “Don’t your eyes ever dry out?” She reached for a dish towel, drying the dish in her hand before placing it on the drying rack. </span></p><p><span>“Nope,” Dulce chirped. “Now spill: why did Agatha leave?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s none of your business, nosy,” Rio huffed, drying her hands on the front of her jeans and limping into the living room to grab her cane – and get away from her probing sister.</span></p><p><span>She heard Dulce place the plate down somewhere and follow on Rio’s heels. She could have easily beat Rio to the living room with two legs that still held full sensation, but she let Rio stay ahead of her before she stepped in her way, hands on hips, still standing a full half-foot shorter than her big sister. Dulce gave her that stubborn look that Rio hated – mainly because it reminded her of their mother. Her nose was wrinkled, her lips were pursed, and there was a little line between her eyes that looked like Pi with the crinkle of her brows. Rio used to tease her about it being the reason she was such a smarty-pants.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, it only came out when Dulce was frustrated about something.</span></p><p><span>Rio still found it adorable.</span></p><p><span>She reached out to poke the little line, but Dulce smacked her hand away.</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” she said, her voice hard as stone, “what happened?”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed thickly, feeling a lump begin to form. She clenched her teeth for a second and sniffed before she answered: “I don’t know.”</span></p><p><span>“Bullshit,” Dulce said.</span></p><p><span>“It’s not bullshit.”</span></p><p><span>Dulce’s stare hardened; Rio actually winced.</span></p><p><span>“You look like Dad,” she said. It was something that Dulce always hated to hear, but while that look was mostly their mother, the eyes were an echo of their father’s when he disapproved of something – when he bothered to show any emotion at all, that is.</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” Dulce said, seriously, “please just tell me what happened. You two were happy, like, an hour ago. You were practically dry-humping over eggs. How do you go from </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> to…” she motioned to Rio, “</span><em><span>this</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>“First of all, </span><em><span>rude</span></em><span>,” Rio huffed, feigning hurt. She took a deep breath. “Secondly…I really don’t know. I just…I don’t think she feels the same.”</span></p><p><span>“What?” Dulce huffed, disbelievingly. “What makes you say that?”</span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged, placing her cane back against the wall and lowering herself to the couch. “When I asked her if we were going to tell our support group about us, she kind of acted like there wasn’t anything to tell. She was really casual about it, too.” Rio looked at her feet.</span></p><p><span>Dulce perched herself on the coffee table. “What did she say exactly? What did </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> say exactly?”</span></p><p><span>“I asked if we were going to tell the others,” Rio said, “and then she said ‘about what?’ like last night…and the night before meant absolutely nothing.”</span></p><p><span>“I think you’re reading a little too much into this,” Dulce said. “I mean, that doesn’t sound super serious. Besides, how long have you even been dating? A week?”</span></p><p><span>“We </span><em><span>met</span></em><span> a week ago,” Rio said. “Technically, we didn’t even go on our first date until, uh, Wednesday?”</span></p><p><span>“Bitch,” Dulce scoffed. “I know lesbians get real serious real fast, but you expect her to already be head over heels for you in less than a week?”</span></p><p><span>“No!” Rio defended. “I just…I dunno, Duls! I’ve never been in a relationship before! Not like this! I’ve never felt for anybody what I feel for Agatha. I liked her from the first moment I saw her, you know? I thought she might feel the same way.”</span></p><p><span>“She probably </span><em><span>does</span></em><span>, dipshit,” Dulce said. “But her asking a clarifying question is not enough of a reason to doubt her feelings for you. Notice how she didn’t even </span><em><span>deny</span></em><span> that she was your girlfriend last night when I called her that?”</span></p><p><span>“She probably didn’t even hear you,” Rio said, looking away, but she knew Dulce had a point. Dammit. She hated when her baby sister was right and she was wrong. That wasn’t how the world was supposed to work.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, she </span><em><span>definitely</span></em><span> heard me,” Dulce retorted, smirking. “Her ears turned pink. She avoided looking at you. She pressed her lips together. She was a little embarrassed.”</span></p><p><span>“Because she doesn’t want to be my–”</span></p><p><span>Dulce hit her over the head with a pillow. “No, you dumbass,” Dulce said. “Just the opposite. I think she </span><em><span>liked</span></em><span> being called your girlfriend. Otherwise, she probably would have denied it herself or run for the hills. Agatha Harkness does not seem, to me, the kind of person who would stay somewhere she doesn’t want to be, with somebody she doesn’t want to be with, you know? And she stayed to do…</span><em><span>whatever</span></em><span> it was you two were doing last night.” Rio opened her mouth, but Dulce held her hand up to stop her words. “Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna know. All I can be sure of is that all your clothes stayed on, and I don’t want to think any further about it. Okay?” Rio nodded. Dulce lowered her hand. “Agatha likes you,” she said. “Like, she </span><em><span>really</span></em><span> likes you. You just need to get your head out of your ass and see that. Don’t just rush to conclusions because you’re scared about being liked by a badass boss babe.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re still obsessed with her, aren’t you?” Rio teased. </span></p><p><span>“And trying </span><em><span>real hard</span></em><span> to make her my sister-in-law,” Dulce confirmed. “Don’t fuck this up for me.” </span></p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes, but she knew Dulce was right (though her motivations were questionable): she had let her insecurities win and probably just fucked everything up with a woman she really liked because…why? Because she was scared? Because she’d never been in a relationship like this before?</span></p><p><span>She’d had relationships before. She’d been with women before. Hot women. </span><em><span>Gorgeous</span></em><span> women. Women who liked her back and thought she was just as hot as she thought them. Women who stuck around for a few months, even.</span></p><p><span>But only a few months. Never longer than six consecutive. Definitely longer than a week, though.</span></p><p><span>But she’d never felt this giddy about a woman before. She’d never felt the tightness in her stomach and chest like she did when she saw – or even just thought about – Agatha Harkness. She’d never wanted to call somebody her girlfriend so much that it made her physically </span><em><span>ache</span></em><span> in such a short amount of time. </span></p><p><span>And she </span><em><span>wanted</span></em><span> to call Agatha her girlfriend. She wanted to look at her and think, confidently, </span><em><span>There’s my girlfriend.</span></em><span> She didn’t want to doubt that Agatha felt the same way about her, that Rio was more than just a hookup and a few fun dates.</span></p><p><span>But she couldn’t make herself get over it – not just yet. Because, honestly, she </span><em><span>didn’t</span></em><span> know how Agatha felt. She was kind of too scared to even find out at this point. That’s probably why she hadn’t let Agatha keep talking earlier.</span></p><p><span>No. That was </span><em><span>definitely</span></em><span> why she hadn’t let Agatha keep talking earlier. Because if Agatha didn’t verbally reject her, like Rio was fearing, then </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span> was the one who was putting an end to…whatever this was before it could really take off.</span></p><p><span>And that was better.</span></p><p><span>Wasn’t it?</span></p><p><span>“Earth to Rio.” Dulce waved her hand in front of her sister’s face. Rio blinked and swallowed thickly. “You good, dude?” </span></p><p><span>“I’m fine,” Rio said, rubbing her eyes. “Sorry. I just…I fucked up, I think.”</span></p><p><span>“Duh,” Dulce huffed. “I know I’m the smart one, but you’re not dumb, ya know. You might be blind, though.” She held up her hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?”</span></p><p><span>She flipped Rio off, and Rio slapped her hand away, glaring at her.</span></p><p><span>“Asshole,” she muttered.</span></p><p><span>“You raised me,” Dulce pointed out with a shrug.</span></p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes and decided not to comment on that. It wasn’t because she had nothing to say. It wasn’t.</span></p><p><span>“How do I unfuck it up?” she asked. “How do I make amends?”</span></p><p><span>“Just…talk to her?” Dulce shrugged. “I dunno, dude. I have a similar situation to work out with Morgan, or did you forget?”</span></p><p><span>“Well, in your case, you’re just trying to let somebody down easy who has a crush on you,” Rio pointed out. “In </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> case, I’m–”</span></p><p><span>“Professing your undying love for the bossest bitch in Westview?”</span></p><p><span>“Chill out,” Rio said, her face beginning to flame with embarrassment. “Like you said, it’s been about a week.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s at least six months in lesbian time,” Dulce retorted.</span></p><p><span>“As if you would know.”</span></p><p><span>“I know a little more about that kind of thing than you think,” Dulce said, her own cheeks turning a little pink.</span></p><p><span>“What does that mean?” Rio asked, her eyes widening slightly. “Are you…?”</span></p><p><span>Dulce shrugged. “No clue still,” she admitted. “I’ve liked guys in the past. I had a whole-ass boyfriend even.”</span></p><p><span>“Whom I still plan to murder,” Rio interjected.</span></p><p><span>“Good luck with that,” Dulce snorted. “And I’ve definitely found women hot in the past. And present.”</span></p><p><span>“Like Agatha?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>“Ew, no, that’s my future sister-in-law,” Dulce said, wrinkling her nose. “Gross.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“I was thinking more…Yelena? Maybe?”</span></p><p><span>“Dulce, she’s like two years older than </span><em><span>me</span></em><span>!”</span></p><p><span>“And insanely hot. Have you </span><em><span>seen</span></em><span> her arms?” Dulce pretended to wave herself. “Also, that Peggy chick can </span><em><span>also</span></em><span> get it.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m buying you a chastity belt,” Rio muttered. </span></p><p><span>“God forbid a girl has fantasies about hot women!” Dulce huffed. “Anyway, the point is that I </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> find women attractive, and I’d like to explore that. The trick is letting Morgan know that I’m into women, but I’m just not…”</span></p><p><span>“Into her?” Dulce nodded, blushing. Rio reached out and squeezed her knee. “It’s not going to be easy,” she said, “and she probably won’t be the </span><em><span>most</span></em><span> mature about it, being nineteen and all, but…I think that eventually she’ll get over it. She’ll find another cute queer girl to be her girlfriend, probably at college, and forget she ever saw you as anything more than a friend. Just give it time.”</span></p><p><span>Dulce nodded, frowning. “I just hope I haven’t lost her as a friend completely, you know? Morgan’s younger, yeah, but she’s probably the best friend I’ve ever had.”</span></p><p><span>“Hey!” Rio said, taking back her hand as if burned.</span></p><p><span>“You know what I mean,” Dulce grumbled. “The best friend I’ve ever had that </span><em><span>wasn’t</span></em><span> forced to raise me. It’s a plus that Morgan hasn’t changed my diapers, trust me.”</span></p><p><span>“But then how will she ever really know you?” Rio teased, patting her knee. “Ponder that.” </span></p><p><span>Dulce made a face as Rio stood, grabbing her cane. “Where are you going?” she asked as Rio began to hobble toward her bedroom.</span></p><p><span>“I’m going to take a shower, get changed, and head to the gallery to possibly beg for forgiveness,” Rio answered.</span></p><p><span>“Possibly?” Dulce called out after her as she approached her bedroom down the hall.</span></p><p><span>“We’ll see how it goes,” Rio replied, over her shoulder. “I might need to get on my knees for </span><em><span>other</span></em><span> reasons.” She grinned when Dulce started gagging.</span></p><p><span>Her smile dropped when she shut the door behind her, though, and she swallowed thickly, feeling her chest and stomach grow tight.</span></p><p><span>But not in the good way. Not at </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> in the good way.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b>Chapter Fifteen</b></p><p><span>Agatha sat in front of her easel, pencil in hand, determined to finish the sketch and get started on painting the sun…rise? Set? </span></p><p><span>She still didn’t know, but she wasn’t going to get anywhere if she couldn’t figure out how to style the figure’s hair. She’d put it off for too long already. And there was no time like the present to get it done.</span></p><p><span>Especially when she could use this painting as a distraction from…way too many other things. She sighed and placed her pencil against the paper just above the woman’s head, sketching a long line that stretched from the center of the woman’s head all the way down to her waist, where the dress shirt Agatha had sketched for her spilled out of a pair of wide-leg trousers. </span></p><p><span>Agatha drew a second line. </span></p><p><span>And then a third. </span></p><p><span>And then more lines. And more until she had the loose outline of a full head of long, wavy hair cascading over the woman’s shoulders. The woman’s pale eye continued to stare back at Agatha as she attempted to add some sort of shape to the hair, feeling frustrated with the way the strands wouldn’t fall quite right over her face as she attempted not to ruin what she’d already made.</span></p><p><span>She felt like Pygmalion, attempting to make a perfect work of art only to be frustrated by her own inadequacies. She took a deep breath and placed her pencil down, pushing away from the easel and standing up. She stretched her back, feeling a few pops in her spine as she grunted in relief, rubbing the sore spots. </span></p><p><span>She’d been hunched over the canvas for at least the last hour, just based on how stiff her back was and the shift in the sun from her window. She had meant to go straight to the gallery after changing at home, but she found herself lacking the motivation to leave her house at the moment. </span></p><p><span>She tried not to think of the reason why as she stretched her legs and ignored the photograph on her wall on her way out the door. She padded toward the kitchen in her bare feet and made her way to the kitchen, grabbing a water bottle from the fridge. Her stomach growled lightly as she took a long sip from the bottle, but she didn’t really feel like eating anything, as hungry as she apparently was.</span></p><p><span>She really wished she had finished that burrito, or at least that she had taken it with her. It was stupid to have left it there. Stupid to let food go to waste. She was certain that Rio had tossed it the second Agatha walked out the door. She probably never wanted to see Agatha again.</span></p><p><span>The plastic bottle crinkled in her hand as Agatha’s grip tightened around it and she screwed the cap back on, practically slamming it onto the counter, her eyes burning and lower lip trembling. </span></p><p><em><span>“About what?”</span></em></p><p><span>“Stupid,” she whispered to herself. “So fucking stupid.”</span></p><p><em><span>“About what?”</span></em><span> </span></p><p><span>She ran her hands through her hair, her fingers tangling slightly in the knots. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>About what?”</span></em></p><p><span>There was a lump in her throat and tightness in her chest as she struggled to breathe. It felt like somebody was squeezing her from behind, but not the way Rio had earlier.</span></p><p><em><span>“About what?”</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha spun around, but there was nobody there. She was alone. She was always alone. She made sure of it, either on purpose or…</span></p><p><em><span>“About what?”</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha covered her ears and shook her head, backing herself up against the island and sliding down to the tiled floor. She could still feel that tightness in her chest, squeezing her from the inside out. She closed her eyes tight and started humming to drown out the words that played on repeat in her head.</span></p><p><span>It didn’t work.</span></p><p><em><span>“About what?”</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha pulled out her phone and swiped through her contacts, landing on a name and pressing it. She put the phone on speaker and listened to it ring.</span></p><p><span>Once. Twice.</span></p><p><span>“Hello?”</span></p><p><span>“Dr. Calderu?” Agatha choked out. She honestly hadn’t expected the doctor to answer her own phone. Usually she got a receptionist or assistant first. She’d only called the doctor two or three times to be fair, though. She sniffled and tried to steady herself and her voice. The pain in her chest didn’t lessen at all. “It’s Agatha Harkness.” She didn’t wait for the doctor to respond. “Can MS cause a heart attack?”</span></p><p><span>“It can,” Dr. Calderu responded, evenly (re: </span><em><span>way too calmly</span></em><span>), “in extreme cases. Moreso, it can cause inflammation that leads to heart disease. It’s unlikely to happen in your case since it’s so early in the progression. What, exactly, are you feeling?”</span></p><p><span>“Tightness,” Agatha said. “In my chest. Around my entire abdomen actually. Like there’s a snake coiling around my body.”</span></p><p><span>“Ah,” Dr. Calderu said. “The MS hug.”</span></p><p><span>“The fucking </span><em><span>what</span></em><span>?!” Agatha demanded. “This doesn’t feel like a hug.”</span></p><p><span>It did, actually, but an unwanted one.</span></p><p><span>“It’s just what we call it,” Dr. Calderu explained, calmly. “It can be caused by dysesthesia, or lesions in the spinal cord. Or, simply, from stress or heat. You’re a runner, yes?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha confirmed, “but I didn’t run today.”</span></p><p><span>“No? Why is that?” Dr. Calderu asked.</span></p><p><span>“I…”</span></p><p><em><span>I woke up underneath another one of your patients and then implied that we were just having fun and I had no interest in pursuing anything more than something casual with her. Accidentally, of course.</span></em></p><p><span>“I felt I needed to prioritize my art today,” Agatha lied. “I haven’t really been doing much of it lately.”</span></p><p><span>“Why do you think </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> is?” </span></p><p><span>“What is this, twenty questions?” Agatha huffed. “I don’t have to explain myself to you. Just please tell me how to get rid of this stupid hug thing.”</span></p><p><span>“It should go away on its own,” the doctor informed her, calmly. “It’s usually caused by stress or heat. Is there anything causing you particular stress?”</span></p><p><span>“No.”</span></p><p><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>“Do you have a fever?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her forehead.</span></p><p><span>“No,” she said. Her forehead felt pretty cool, from what she could tell. She didn’t have a thermometer. But she didn’t </span><em><span>feel</span></em><span> hot at all. If anything, she was kind of cool. Her toes were bare on the tile. Maybe she should put on socks.</span></p><p><span>“Did you sleep well?”</span></p><p><span>Images of Rio’s smiling face above hers flashed in Agatha’s mind. The feeling of her lips on Agatha’s lips, on her throat, her collarbone…</span></p><p><span>She can’t even remember falling asleep the night before, but she hadn’t meant to stay over. She had just not wanted to leave when Rio made her feel so…</span></p><p><span>“Could lack of sleep really cause this?” She rubbed her sternum. It ached. She took a deep breath. That ached, too.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, it’s a possibility. Usually chronic insomnia can lead to the Hug. Have you had trouble sleeping over the last few days or weeks? I could prescribe something to help you sleep. A mild sedative.”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha said. “It’s fine. I just…it’s not that big a deal.”</span></p><p><span>There wasn’t as much pain as there was discomfort. She pushed herself to her feet with her phone cradled between her head and her shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“Maybe it is just stress,” she said. “I mean, we have another showcase at the gallery this weekend, so…” She shrugged and the phone nearly fell to the ground before she caught and fumbled with it a moment. “Maybe that’s it.”</span></p><p><span>“Could be,” Dr. Calderu agreed. “Just let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.” She cleared her throat. “How is it going with your medication?”</span></p><p><span>“Ugh,” Agatha said, looking toward her fridge. “Don’t remind me.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ve been taking it as you should?” Dr. Calderu sounded like her grandmother now: slightly chastising.</span></p><p><span>“I missed a dose yesterday,” Agatha confessed. “But I’ll take it today. I just…I hate needles.”</span></p><p><span>“I understand,” the doctor said, “but this is important. So that the disease does not progress too quickly, you must keep up with your injections.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha sighed. “I will. It’s not that bad, really. I just…I hate that stupid lump under the skin. It itches.”</span></p><p><span>“Massage the spot while you ice it,” Dr. Calderu advised. “It should help.”</span></p><p><span>“Thanks,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>“And the group?” Dr. Calderu said. “Have you gone?”</span></p><p><span>“Twice,” Agatha said. </span></p><p><span>“And do you like it?” She could hear the smile in Dr. Calderu’s voice.</span></p><p><span>Agatha thought of Rio.</span></p><p><span>“A lot,” she said, honestly. “I might have to miss tonight’s, though, since I have to work on setting up for the showcase.”</span></p><p><span>That was a lie. The showcase was </span><em><span>Jen’s</span></em><span> responsibility this week, not Agatha’s.</span></p><p><span>“It will still be there on Thursday,” Dr. Calderu said. “I even show up from time to time to see my patients. Keep going with it; the women there are all lovely.”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” Agatha agreed, still thinking of Rio. “They are.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio’s grip tightened on the handle of her cane as she hobbled into the gallery. Her leg was tingling from walking so long without a break, but she didn’t want to give herself enough time to change her mind and hobble back to her apartment to hide away in shame. </span></p><p><span>Dulce would absolutely murder her if she did.</span></p><p><span>“Miss Vidal!” the young woman working the front counter exclaimed, smiling that big, bright smile of hers. “Welcome back! Here to look at some more artwork?”</span></p><p><span>“Actually,” Rio said, “I’m here to see Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha?” The girl furrowed her brow and pursed her lips. “Miss Harkness hasn’t come in today. Not yet, anyway.”</span></p><p><span>“She hasn’t?” Rio asked. </span></p><p><span>Agatha had mentioned there being another showcase happening at the gallery the upcoming weekend. Jen would be handling all the logistics, but Agatha would probably still be expected to help out in any way that she could. She had been certain that Agatha would come straight to the gallery to help out after leaving Rio’s.</span></p><p><span>“Nope!” the young woman said. “She doesn’t come in every day, though. Sometimes she works from home. Sometimes she comes in a little later.” She looked at her watch. “Not this late, though.” It was already past two. “I guess you’ll have to catch her another time.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, her heart sinking. “Sure,” she said, trying and failing to give America a forced smile. “Another time. Thanks.”</span></p><p><span>She started to turn away, but then another idea occurred to her. “Is Jen here?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>“Miss Kale?” America chirped. “Yes, she is!” She motioned toward the offices to the side. Agatha’s door was closed with the lights off, but the adjacent door – presumably Jen’s office – was cracked open, and the lights were clearly on. “She’s a little busy with preparations for our upcoming showcase, though, so she might not–”</span></p><p><span>Rio was already hobbling toward the office, starting to sweat a little from the effort not to collapse as her leg went almost completely numb. She didn’t even bother to knock on Jen’s door, instead simply letting herself inside and dragging herself to the nearest seat – which just so happened to be a hot pink easy chair that Rio practically disappeared into the second she sat down.</span></p><p><span>She still breathed a sigh of relief as she started to massage her leg, flexing her foot and stretching out her calf, trying to get the feeling back in the nerve-damaged limb. </span></p><p><span>“Uh…hello?” </span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Rio responded, still massaging her leg as she looked up at Jen, who was sitting in front of a pile of paperwork on her desk, her pen poised over an open folder. “I hope I didn’t disrupt anything important.”</span></p><p><span>“Um…” Jen said, looking between Rio and the folder in her hand. She closed the folder. “Not really, I guess. Can I help you with something?”</span></p><p><span>“Have you seen Agatha?” Rio asked. Might as well get right to it.</span></p><p><span>“Not today,” Jen said, picking up her phone. “I don’t have any texts from her, anyway. Why? Is she not answering your calls and texts? Did you guys have a sucky date or something?”</span></p><p><span>“No!” Rio huffed. “Why would you even…our date was fine! Better than fine, actually.”</span></p><p><span>Her cheeks flushed when she thought of the previous night, of lips kissing and hands roaming and bodies pressing together. Sure, they’d kept all their clothes on, but Agatha’s legs had still wrapped around Rio’s–</span></p><p><span>“Hello?!” Jen huffed. “You gonna sit there blushing, or are you going to explain why you’ve come to </span><em><span>me</span></em><span> to ask about Agatha when you could just, I dunno, </span><em><span>text her</span></em><span>?”</span></p><p><span>“Uh…”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s eyes narrowed immediately at that.</span></p><p><span>“What did you do?” she demanded.</span></p><p><span>Rio was taken aback by the steel in Jen’s gaze. They didn’t know each other well, so she hadn’t exactly expected </span><em><span>this</span></em><span> reaction from the taller woman. And she was just noticing how much taller – and likely in better physical shape – Jen was than her.</span></p><p><span>“Why do you assume </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> did something?” Rio asked, defensively. It was hard to be defensive when she was absolutely sinking into this frou frou pink, fuzzy couch though. She tried to push herself up, but her hands just sunk into the cushions as well.</span></p><p><span>“Because </span><em><span>you’re</span></em><span> the one who’s come looking for </span><em><span>her</span></em><span>,” Jen pointed out. </span></p><p><span>It was sound logic, Rio had to admit. And it wasn’t too far off from the truth. Rio </span><em><span>had</span></em><span> been the one to fuck shit up. She’d let her insecurities get ahead of her and shut down over a stupid question.</span></p><p><em><span>“About what?”</span></em></p><p><span>She closed her eyes against the memory of those words. They were such simple words. Reasonable words, really. Agatha had obviously just been asking for clarification and Rio had just…panicked. Like a spooked horse.</span></p><p><span>She hated horses. </span></p><p><span>“What, was the sex bad or something?” Jen snorted, crossing her arms over her chest and cocking her hip. “I didn’t take you for a bad lay.”</span></p><p><span>“What?!” Rio exclaimed, face flaming. “No! We didn’t even– </span><em><span>that’s none of your business, Jennifer!</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>“Ugh, the full name,” Jen huffed, wrinkling her nose. “I hate that.” She took a deep breath and leaned back against her desk. “So what was it then? What did you say?”</span></p><p><span>“Again, why do you assume –”</span></p><p><span>“Which one of you is in my office right now?” Jen asked, raising one eyebrow.</span></p><p><span>“Only because I can’t get out of this stupid couch,” Rio grunted. “I’m about to slip between these absurdly fluffy cushions. Are you a prepubescent girl or something?!” </span></p><p><span>“Stop dodging the question,” Jen said, pushing off from the desk and sauntering over to offer her hand to Rio. Rio glared at the perfectly manicured fingers.</span></p><p><span>“When was the last time you saw Alice?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>Jen rolled her eyes. “I’ve washed my hands since then, don’t worry,” she said. “You won’t catch any of Alice’s cooties.”</span></p><p><span>“What about yours?” Rio snarked.</span></p><p><span>“Look, if you’d rather slip between the cushions…”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed and reached for Jen’s hand, allowing herself to be tugged to her feet. Jen was surprisingly strong and sturdy for someone so thin. And her hands were almost annoyingly soft and unblemished for somebody who supposedly worked so much with chemicals to create her own paints. </span></p><p><span>“You need help to a chair?” Jen asked, her voice a little softer now as she stepped back, still close enough to offer Rio a hand if she needed it.</span></p><p><span>“My legs still work, somewhat,” Rio said, grabbing her cane and hobbling toward one of the chairs in front of Jen’s desk. “Thanks.”</span></p><p><span>“Anytime,” Jen said. It sounded genuine.</span></p><p><span>The chair Rio sat in was just as pink as the couch but much sturdier. The cushion barely budged under her weight, which was a relief.</span></p><p><span>“So,” Jen said, sitting down in her own seat across the desk from Rio, “what happened?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s none of your business,” Rio groused.</span></p><p><span>“Then what are you still doing here?” Jen looked tired as she leaned back in her seat, manicured nails tapping on the arms of her expensive-looking leather chair. It, too, had a kind of rose tint. Everything in this woman’s life seemed to be pink. “You can leave at any time, you know. I don’t think Agatha’s coming in today, anyway.”</span></p><p><span>“She’s not?” Rio’s entire body seemed to deflate at that. </span></p><p><span>“You see, it’s reactions like that that make me think something </span><em><span>did</span></em><span> happen,” Jen said, pointing at her, “and you </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> need my help to fix it. So spill: what happened between you and Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>“We didn’t have sex,” Rio said, defensively.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, you’ve already said that,” Jen replied. “I know that part. I asked what </span><em><span>did</span></em><span> happen.”</span></p><p><span>“We slept together.”</span></p><p><span>“But you just–”</span></p><p><span>“Literally </span><em><span>slept</span></em><span>, Jen,” Rio clarified. “Like she–well, we </span><em><span>both</span></em><span> slept on my couch last night after…making out a little.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s eyebrows shot straight up and nearly left her head. “How much is </span><em><span>a little</span></em><span>?” she asked, her voice cracking. There was an unmistakable smile threatening the corners of her mouth, but Rio could see her physically fighting to stay casual about it. Her eyes shone with joy, however.</span></p><p><span>Fucking weirdo.</span></p><p><span>“An hour or so, I dunno,” Rio huffed. “Don’t tell Agatha I told you that, though. Something tells me she doesn’t really want anybody to know about it.”</span></p><p><span>Jen’s brow furrowed at that. “What would make you say that?” she asked. </span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged. “I dunno,” she said, looking down at her lap. “It didn’t seem like she was really all that into it.”</span></p><p><span>“After making out with you for </span><em><span>an hour</span></em><span>, it didn’t seem like she was into it?” Jen snorted and shook her head, her eyes wide with disbelief as she stared at Rio. “After falling asleep with you on your couch, it didn’t seem like she was into it? Girl, is your brain okay?”</span></p><p><span>“I mean, there are definitely a few lesions I could do without,” Rio said, scratching her head through her beanie with a shrug.</span></p><p><span>“You might have a few new ones affecting your judgement because what the actual fuck?” Jen snorted. “Do women </span><em><span>often</span></em><span> make out with you when they’re not into it? Is that just a popular passtime that I’m unaware of? A way to fight off the boredom?”</span></p><p><span>“Fuck off,” Rio muttered, feeling her face heat up. Jen was making too many good points. She didn’t like it. “I just…I asked her if she wanted to tell our support group about us tonight and she…didn’t seem into it.”</span></p><p><span>“So?” Jen asked.</span></p><p><span>“You sound like my sister!” Rio huffed. “This is a big deal, isn’t it? I mean, we’ve had, like, </span><em><span>three dates</span></em><span> already. She was kissing me just this morning! Is that </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> a thing!?”</span></p><p><span>“Girl, be so fucking for real,” Jen said. “I know Agatha, and relationships are a big deal to her. </span><em><span>You</span></em><span> don’t get to decide whether </span><em><span>she</span></em><span> is in one just because you made out for a little bit one night. Besides, what, exactly, did she even say that’s making you act this dumb about it?”</span></p><p><span>Rio pressed her lips together for a long moment, her arms crossed over her chest, before taking a deep breath and telling Jen everything that had happened, starting with the kiss over ice cream the night before (“Oh my god, that’s adorable!”) and ending with Agatha walking out halfway through breakfast.</span></p><p><span>She spared no detail, reasoning that Agatha probably would have told her the entire thing eventually, anyway. Besides, it felt good to get it all off her chest to somebody who probably wouldn’t hit her over the head with a pillow.</span></p><p><span>“You’re an idiot.”</span></p><p><span>Well, at least she didn’t </span><em><span>have</span></em><span> a pillow right at this very moment.</span></p><p><span>“To be fair, you’re </span><em><span>both</span></em><span> idiots,” Jen added. “But you even moreso because what do you </span><em><span>mean</span></em><span> you tried to DTR and then just shut down over two words?”</span></p><p><span>“What’s DTR?” Rio asked, tilting her head.</span></p><p><span>“Define the Relationship,” Jen said, snapping her fingers. “Keep up, dummy.”</span></p><p><span>“Fuck off,” Rio huffed, but she couldn’t deny that Jen was a little bit correct. Rio had already admitted it to herself and her sister.</span></p><p><span>Still, Jen had no right to–</span></p><p><span>“Agatha likes you,” Jen said. “It’s so blatantly </span><em><span>obvious</span></em><span> that she likes you. The fact that you’re the only one who can’t seem to see it even with her tongue down your throat is so pathetic that it’s almost impressive. You’re like the poster child for useless lesbians everywhere.”</span></p><p><span>“Do you often roast your so-called sister’s crushes like this or am I just a special case?” Rio deadpanned after a long moment of letting Jen’s words sink in.</span></p><p><span>“You’re the dumbest case I’ve seen in half a decade, that’s for sure,” Jen said, leaning her chin on her hand. “What are you so scared of?”</span></p><p><span>“What?” Rio asked. “I’m not–”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, you are,” Jen said, not letting her finish. “You’re terrified. That much is clear.”</span></p><p><span>“Did Dulce call you?” Rio asked, narrowing her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“I might have gotten a text that says, and I quote, ‘My sister is a dumbass.’” Jen shrugged. “I had no idea what she was talking about until right now, though. And I have to say that I definitely agree with her on that.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m gonna dropkick that kid out a window when I get home,” Rio muttered to herself. “Look, I just need to know where Agatha is so that I can apologize to her and try to work this out. Do you think you can help me with that?”</span></p><p><span>“I can try,” Jen said, noncommittally. “But Agatha is a stubborn bitch. She doesn’t always listen to me about shit even when she should. Also, I have no idea where she is. She was supposed to come in today to sign some papers for our showcase, but she texted me that she was staying home and would sign the papers tomorrow if I really needed them.”</span></p><p><span>“So she’s probably at home then,” Rio concluded. </span></p><p><span>“Or she went for a run,” Jen pointed out. “That’s what she does when she’s stressed out.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s face fell. “Do you think I stressed her out?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>“Not you, specifically,” Jen assured her. “Just…the situation.” She shrugged. “Maybe a little bit you, as well.”</span></p><p><span>Rio breathed out a little puff of air. “Any chance you’d give me her address?”</span></p><p><span>“Nope,” Jen said. “Agatha would quite literally kill me if I did that. You’re just gonna have to stalk her at work like a normal person.”</span></p><p><span>“You have a very skewed outlook of what ‘normal’ is, you know that?”</span></p><p><span>“So I’ve been told,” Jen said. “You think she’ll show up at your little group thing tonight?”</span></p><p><span>“I doubt it,” Rio said. “She hasn’t answered any of my texts, so she’s probably avoiding me.”</span></p><p><span>“Are they still going through?” Jen asked.</span></p><p><span>Rio checked her phone. All of her texts were marked ‘delivered’ but none of them had been marked ‘Read’ yet.</span></p><p><span>That could mean nothing if Agatha just turned off the read receipts though.</span></p><p><span>“They’re still going through,” Rio informed her.</span></p><p><span>“Then she hasn’t blocked you yet,” Jen pointed out. “That’s a good sign. She blocked me </span><em><span>immediately</span></em><span> after–” She clamped her lips shut, her eyes widening.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes shot to her face, gaze narrowing. “After what?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>Jen swallowed thickly, shaking her head. “Nothing,” she said. “Nothing.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes narrowed further, channelling her inner-Dulce as she fought to keep herself from blinking. She leaned closer, not saying anything, and she could swear a bead of sweat formed on Jen’s forehead as she leaned back in her chair.</span></p><p><span>“After,” she said, feeling herself starting to lose the battle to keep her eyes from blinking, “what?”</span></p><p><span>Jen swallowed thickly. She opened her mouth, about to say something that looked as though it pained her. But then, before a single sound could escape her lips, her phone began to vibrate on her desk and she breathed out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span>“Sorry,” she said. “I have to take this. I trust you can make your own way out. Thanks!” She hastily picked up the phone and turned the chair so that she was facing away from Rio. “Hey, Mom!” she said into the receiver.</span></p><p><span>Rio let out a breath from her nose in frustration, but she didn’t argue. She just stood, leaning heavily on her cane, and hobbled toward the door.</span></p><p><span>“Do you want this open or closed?” she asked, over her shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, you can just leave it open,” Jen said, chipperly, waving at Rio.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, stepping out into the foyer, and slammed the door shut behind her, giving Jen the finger through the little window before she made her way toward the exit.</span></p>

<p>End Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis when I was 29 years old, just two months shy of my thirtieth birthday. My diagnosis story is exactly the same as I wrote for Agatha in this chapter. I didn't think anything was going to be wrong and then it was. I grappled with the fact that I have MS for a long time. It's not as devastating as I originally had thought it was (due in large part to the public conversations surrounding it and the celebrities who come out about having it, who are further along than I am in the progression of their disease), but it's still something that I have to live with every single day.</p><p>But I'm living, so...</p><p>Anyway. I hope you enjoy this story. I do intend to make major edits at the end of it and possibly publish it with all original characters, so I hope that you can give me all your thoughts and feelings in the comments. Thanks!</p></blockquote>
