<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>There was no getting around that the bleacher seats, worn smooth by decades of fans and warmed in the sun, were deeply uncomfortable and unforgiving. Rio could certainly afford better now. She hadn’t checked prices in a while but was confident that following her most recent promotion, the box seats up on the promenade level weren’t as far off as they had seemed when she was a child.</span></p><p><span>She could still remember peering up at those mythical box seats with their cushioned chairs and personal servers bringing food right to you. People up there had actual shade from the sun, cup holders, and probably bathrooms without lines stretching around the concourse, and the floor was at least a little less sticky.</span></p><p><span>"Abuela," she'd whispered, tugging on her grandmother's sleeve. "Why can't we sit up there?"</span></p><p><span>Her abuela had followed her gaze, then looked back down with that expression Rio would later recognize as a masterclass in deflection. </span></p><p><span>"Pah! Those poor people up there in their fancy seats, they miss everything! When have you ever seen someone in the boxes catch a foul ball? Never! They're too far away, too comfortable. Baseball isn't meant to be comfortable."</span></p><p><span>Even at seven, Rio had suspected this was at least partly bullshit. But her abuela had opened the scorebook then, showing Rio how to mark a stolen base, and the far-off people in their fancy seats had faded from her mind.</span></p><p><span>Twenty-five years later, Rio still chose these bleacher seats. Not because she couldn't afford better, but because her abuela had been right about one thing: you could feel the game differently down here. The crack of the bat hit you in the chest. The roar of the crowd was a physical force. And down in the gallery, you never knew who you’d end up sitting next to.</span></p><p><span>Rio had arrived forty minutes before first pitch to claim her lucky spot in the bleachers and began arranging her scorebook, filling in the initial details.</span></p><p><span>The late afternoon sun painted Wrigley's ivy-covered walls gold. It was perfect weather. A perfect baseball day. Before long, she’d tune out the noise of the crowd and give herself over to being a part of the ritual of the day.</span></p><p><span>But her meditation was interrupted as a whirlwind in an oversized Cardinals jersey crashed against the seat next to her.</span></p><p><span>"Mama! Mama, look! You can see </span><em><span>everything</span></em><span> from here! When does it start? Can I get a hot dog? I want one with </span><em><span>everything</span></em><span>—"</span></p><p><span>Rio's pencil skipped across the lineup she was transcribing. She looked up to find a small boy practically vibrating with excitement, his Cardinals jersey hanging past his knees, a foam finger bigger than his head clutched in both hands.</span></p><p><span>A Cardinals fan. Of course. Brave to pick two seats deep in supporter territory, she had to respect that.</span></p><p><span>"Nicky, </span><em><span>breathe</span></em><span>." A harried woman slid into the space between the boy and Rio, juggling a backpack, a booster seat, and what possibly was the entire weight of the world on her shoulders. "We talked about using our polite voices, remember?"</span></p><p><span>"But Mama, we're </span><em><span>outside</span></em><span>—"</span></p><p><span>"Nicholas."</span></p><p><span>The boy deflated slightly, but his grin never wavered. His mother wrestled the booster seat into position. When she straightened, pushing dark hair out of her face, Rio caught a glimpse of her expression: exhausted but determined. Like she was daring the universe to ruin this.</span></p><p><span>Rio found herself staring a beat too long. The woman was beautiful in that sharp, striking way of someone who had been chewed out by the world a bit but continued to bite back. High cheekbones, a mouth that looked like it smiled easily despite everything, and those eyes—blue and assessing and currently fixed on Rio with a flicker of self-consciousness.</span></p><p><span>Rio looked away quickly, back to her scorebook, feeling oddly caught.</span></p><p><span>She knew she should return to her pre-game focus. First pitch in thirty minutes. She needed to finalize her notes on the Cardinals' lineup, check the wind direction, and settle into her pre-game ritual.</span></p><p><span>"Excuse me, miss?" The boy, Nicky, had twisted around his mother to face her; the part of his face not obscured by his cap was covered by his gap-toothed grin. </span></p><p><span>"Do you know if Molina is playing today? I think he's the best catcher in the </span><em><span>whole world</span></em><span>. Well, except he's not playing anymore, but Contreras is really good too, Mama says he learned from Molina so it's basically the same thing—"</span></p><p><span>"Nicky, I'm sure this nice woman doesn't want to—"</span></p><p><span>"He's not in the lineup today," Rio found herself answering automatically. "Contreras is catching."</span></p><p>Nicky's face lit up, and he began to scramble into his mother's lap to get a better look at her.</p><p><span>"Do you keep score? I saw your book! I'm </span><em><span>really</span></em><span> good at numbers. I can count to one hundred. Wanna hear?"</span></p><p><span>"Maybe after the game starts, baby," his mother interjected, her cheeks flushed as she turned to Rio. "I'm so sorry, we don’t mean to disturb you. He's just excited. We don't… this is a big deal for us."</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled and nodded. She recognized this type of woman. There were dark circles under those eyes, and her clothes, while clean, had the worn quality of items that had been loved past their prime. The Cardinals jersey the boy wore was authentic, though. Not a knockoff.</span></p><p><span>Rio thought about the price of tickets in this section. She thought about the sacrifices that had been made when she was a child, allowing her abuela to bring her at least twice a season.</span></p><p><span>"It's fine," Rio said, and was surprised to find she meant it. "Your son has good taste. Even if it is the wrong team."</span></p><p><span>The woman's eyebrows rose. "Wrong team?"</span></p><p><span>Rio tapped her Cubs cap. "Just stating facts."</span></p><p><span>"Oh, you're one of </span><em><span>those</span></em><span>." But the woman was smiling now, and though Rio couldn’t always tell the difference, it seemed like a real one. “May the best team win, then.”</span></p><p><span>"That would be the Cubs." Rio teased back.</span></p><p><span>"We'll see about that."</span></p><p><span>Nicky beamed at both of them, delighted by the banter. He bounced in his seat, foam finger waving dangerously close to Rio's scorebook. "Mama, can I tell her about the stats? The ones we practiced in the car?"</span></p><p><span>"Maybe let her get ready for the game first, baby—"</span></p><p><span>"It's okay," Rio found herself saying. "What stats did you practice?"</span></p><p><span>That was all the encouragement Nicky needed. He launched into an enthusiastic if somewhat garbled recitation of the Cardinals' batting lineup.</span></p><p><span>His mother watched him with an expression caught somewhere between pride and mortification, occasionally reaching out to gently redirect his foam finger away from Rio's face.</span></p><p><span>"—and then there's the pitcher who mama says throws 'nasty' but I don't think baseballs can be dirty because they clean them before they use them, right?"</span></p><p><span>His mother looked like she wanted the bleacher seat to swallow her whole. "Nicky—"</span></p><p><span>But Rio was laughing, actually laughing, her carefully constructed pre-game focus completely shattered. "Your mom sounds smart."</span></p><p><span>"She is! She's the smartest. She knows about flowers, and she can make anything pretty. And she's really good at making mean people pay more money when they're rude." Nicky said this last part with obvious pride.</span></p><p><span>"</span><em><span>Nicholas</span></em><span>!” She hissed.</span></p><p><span>"What? You said Mr. Henderson was a—"</span></p><p><span>"How about that hot dog?" his mother interrupted desperately, pulling a carefully folded bill from her pocket. "Why don't you and I go grab food before the game starts?"</span></p><p><span>Rio watched them navigate the aisle, Nicky chattering the entire way, his mother's hand protective on his shoulder. She should have been relieved at the return to peace. Instead, she found herself smiling as she penciled in the first batter's name.</span></p><p><span>The pair returned just after the National Anthem, Nicky clutching a hot dog in one hand and a bag of peanuts in the other, his foam finger temporarily tucked under his mother’s arm.</span></p><p><span>"Sorry, sorry, excuse us," She murmured, trying to navigate past Rio with her hands full. "Nicky, careful with the… Here, can you just—"</span></p><p><span>"I've got it," Rio said, reaching out to steady the precariously balanced hot dog before it could tumble into the row below. Her fingers brushed the woman’s fingers for just a moment as she handed it back, and maybe it was her imagination, but it seemed like the responding "thank you" came out slightly breathless.</span></p><p><span>They settled back into their seats with the shuffling chaos of snacks being distributed and the booster seat readjusted. Nicky immediately took an enormous bite of his hot dog, ketchup smearing across his cheek, completely content.</span></p><p><span>The first inning was nearly perfect. The first three outs went down in order. Rio marked each out with satisfaction, her pencil flying across the page. This was her meditation, her church. The geometry of the game unfolding exactly as it should.</span></p><p><span>Then, because the universe has a funny sense of humor, the kid knocked over her beer.</span></p><p><span>It happened in the second inning, when the Cardinals' leadoff hitter crushed a double to left field. Nicky leaped up with a shriek of joy, his elbow catching Rio's cup and sending sixteen ounces of overpriced stadium beer cascading directly into her lap.</span></p><p><span>"Oh my god, oh my </span><em><span>god</span></em><span>, I'm so sorry!" The woman was already on her feet, napkins appearing in her hands like magic, pressing them uselessly against the spreading puddle. "Nicky, what did I tell you about watching where you—here, let me! Shit, your book!"</span></p><p><span>Rio had already snatched the scorebook up, checking for damage. The corner was wet but the pages themselves were fine, her careful notation intact. Her jeans, however, were soaked.</span></p><p><span>"It's fine," Rio said automatically.</span></p><p><span>"It's not fine, I'll replace it. The beer, I mean, not the—let me get you another one. And probably something for the stain? Do they sell club soda here?”</span></p><p><span>Rio looked down and found Nicky staring up at her with those same sharp eyes as his mother, except his were rapidly filling with tears. </span></p><p><span>His bottom lip trembled, and he clutched his foam finger to his chest like a shield. But he wasn't looking at Rio, he was looking at his mother, watching her spiral with the kind of anxiety that suggested he'd seen this before. Seen her work herself into a panic trying to fix things, trying to make everything perfect, trying to prove they deserved to be here.</span></p><p><span>"Mama," he whispered, so quiet Rio almost missed it. "Mama, please don't be upset."</span></p><p><span>That seemed to cut through her panic more effectively than anything else could have.</span></p><p><span>"Hey," Rio said, gentler than she'd intended. "It's really okay. It's just beer."</span></p><p><span>"I'll replace it." The woman's jaw was set in a way that suggested arguing would be futile. "I insist."</span></p><p><span>Rio found herself nodding along. "Okay. If it makes you feel better."</span></p><p><span>"It does." The woman grabbed her wallet with the determination of someone going to war. "I'll be right back. Nicholas, you stay here and apologize properly."</span></p><p><span>She disappeared into the crowd before Rio could protest. Nicky, meanwhile, had gone very quiet, his earlier enthusiasm completely deflated. He stared at his shoes.</span></p><p><span>"I didn't mean to," he whispered. "I was just excited about the double."</span></p><p><span>"It was a nice double," Rio offered.</span></p><p><span>"Are you mad at me?"</span></p><p><span>Rio looked at this tiny kid in his too-big jersey, his eyes shining with the threat of tears, and felt something in her chest twist. "No, kid. I'm not mad. Accidents happen."</span></p><p><span>"Mama saved up for these tickets," Nicky said, still not looking up. "She takes extra shifts at the flower shop and sometimes she works at night on her computer. She says everybody's gotta have a hustle. I don’t want it to be a waste because I ruined it."</span></p><p><em><span>Six months.</span></em></p><p><span>Rio thought about her own season tickets, the payment that automatically deducted from her checking account every spring without her even noticing. She thought about this kid's mother, working god knew what kind of "hustle" to buy her son one perfect day.</span></p><p><span>"Your mom didn't waste anything," Rio said firmly. "And you didn't ruin anything either. It's just beer. I'll have another one in a few minutes and I'll forget this even happened."</span></p><p><span>Nicky finally looked up at her, hopeful. "Really?"</span></p><p><span>"Really. But hey, next time the Cardinals get a hit, maybe just cheer with your arms down?"</span></p><p><span>That got her a wobbly smile. "Okay. I can do that."</span></p><p><span>His mother returned carrying not just a beer but also a bottle of water, a soft pretzel, and a bag of peanuts. She thrust them at Rio with the same fierce determination she'd left with.</span></p><p><span>"I didn't know what you'd want, so I got options. And peanuts. Everyone likes peanuts." She hesitated. "That's not true, lots of people are allergic to peanuts. Are you allergic to peanuts? I hope not. This is meant to be an apology not an assassination."</span></p><p><span>"I'm not allergic," Rio said, bemused by the haul. "But this is way too much. Just the beer was like twelve dollars."</span></p><p><span>"And I ruined your whole inning." The woman finally sat down, looking wrung out. "Trust me, this doesn't even come close to covering the damage."</span></p><p><span>"Your son already apologized very nicely. We’re squared away."</span></p><p><span>The woman's expression softened as she looked at Nicky, who was already focused back on the game. "He really is a good kid."</span></p><p><span>"Seems like it."</span></p><p><span>They sat in silence for a moment, watching as the Cubs' pitcher worked a full count. Rio became aware that she was still holding the ridiculous spread of snacks, and that the woman was watching her with an expression that was hard to read. Grateful, maybe. Or just tired.</span></p><p><span>"I'm Agatha, by the way," the woman said finally. “Since my son just baptized you in overpriced beer, I figured you should at least know my name."</span></p><p><span>Rio snorted. "Rio.”</span></p><p><span>"Rio," Agatha repeated, and something about the way she said it made Rio's stomach flip. "That suits you."</span></p><p><span>"Does it?" Rio found herself asking, which was ridiculous. She didn't care what this stranger thought about her name.</span></p><p><span>Except apparently she did, because she was waiting for Agatha's answer with more attention than she'd given to the entire inning.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha just smirked, and the Cubs' pitcher threw a wild pitch, and Rio forced her attention back to her scorebook, where things made sense.</span></p><p><span>Where she could keep score.</span></p><p><span>The third inning belonged to the Cubs, which left Nicky groaning into his hands. Rio allowed herself a small, satisfied smile as she marked the runs, aware that Agatha was watching her.</span></p><p><span>"You're very serious about that book," Agatha observed.</span></p><p><span>"It's how I always watch the game." Rio finished her notation. "My abuela taught me the first time she brought me. She kept score at every game she went to for sixty years. When she passed, she left me all her scorebooks. Boxes of them. I’ve never known what to do with them… they just have followed me to three apartments now."</span></p><p><span>"That's… wow." Agatha leaned in slightly, studying the page. "It looks like a secret code."</span></p><p><span>"Basically is. See this?" Rio pointed to a symbol. "6-3 putout. That means the shortstop threw to the first baseman for the out."</span></p><p><span>"And this one?"</span></p><p><span>"F8, it’s a fly out to center field."</span></p><p><span>Nicky had twisted around at the sound of their conversation. "Can you teach me?"</span></p><p><span>Rio hesitated. She'd never taught anyone to score before. It felt private. Something that belonged to Rio and someone no longer there.</span></p><p><span>But Nicky was there and he was looking at her with those hopeful eyes, and Agatha had this soft expression on her face, like Rio was doing something remarkable instead of just explaining baseball notation.</span></p><p><span>"Sure," Rio found herself saying. "Next inning, we'll start with the basics."</span></p><p><span>Nicky's whoop of joy echoed over the groans of the crowd as the final out was recorded.</span></p><p><span>Rio gave Nicky a spare napkin and a pencil, and walked him through marking a strikeout. When the batter struck out looking, Nicky carefully drew a backward K, his tongue sticking out in concentration.</span></p><p><span>"Perfect," Rio told him, and he beamed as he drew a smiley face next to the K.</span></p><p><span>"Thank you," Agatha said quietly, while Nicky was focused on the field, waiting for the next play. "For this. You didn't have to—"</span></p><p><span>"It's fine," Rio said, uncomfortable with the gratitude. "He's a good student."</span></p><p><span>"He's been talking about baseball since January. Planning this trip." Agatha's voice dropped even lower. "I wanted to get better seats. Closer to the field. But these were what I could manage."</span></p><p><span>Rio thought about Section 207, Row 5, Seat 12. About how she'd been sitting in these "cheap" seats since she was seven years old, and how some of her best baseball memories lived here.</span></p><p><span>"These are the best seats in the house," Rio said firmly. "Real fans sit in the bleachers."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's smile was blinding.</span></p><p><span>In the fifth, the Cardinals rallied, putting runners on second and third with nobody out. Nicky was back to vibrating with excitement, but true to his word, he kept his arms down.</span></p><p><span>Rio's phone buzzed. She'd been half-ignoring the group chat with her friends all game, but this message made her pause:</span></p><p><em><span>You're at Wrigley and NOT texting us updates? Are you dead? Did you die?</span></em></p><p><span>She snapped a quick photo of her scorebook, about to send it, when she noticed Agatha frantically patting her pockets.</span></p><p><span>"No, no, shit…"</span></p><p><span>"What's wrong?"</span></p><p><span>"My phone." Agatha pulled the device from her bag, stared at the black screen, and made a sound of pure frustration. "It's dead. I forgot to charge it last night. I was so focused on getting everything ready, and I wanted to get pictures." She pressed her palm to her forehead. "Stupid. That was so stupid."</span></p><p><span>"Hey." Rio touched her arm without thinking, felt Agatha startle slightly under her hand. "It's not stupid. You want me to take some photos? I can text them to you."</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at her like she'd just offered something far more valuable. "You'd do that?"</span></p><p><span>"Sure. It's just a photo."</span></p><p><span>It decidedly was not "just a photo." Rio discovered this when she attempted to capture a candid of Nicky and ended up taking seven photos, trying to get the angle right, trying to make sure the light hit him properly, trying to frame it so Agatha would be able to see what Rio saw: this kid in his element, glowing with happiness, the ivy and brick of Wrigley rising behind him like a cathedral and his mother beside him who couldn’t look more beautiful and proud.</span></p><p><span>"Got it," Rio said finally, pulling up her contacts. "What's your number?"</span></p><p><span>Agatha recited it, and Rio saved her as "Agatha (Cardinals Fan)". </span></p><p><span>"Thank you," Agatha said, and there was that weight again. That sense that Rio had done something monumental without realizing it.</span></p><p><span>"No problem," Rio said, and returned to her scorebook before she could think too hard about why Agatha's smile made her chest feel so warm.</span></p><p><span>The sixth inning brought the first home run.</span></p><p><span>Or almost brought it. The Cubs' third baseman crushed a ball to deep left center, and for one glorious moment the entire stadium held its breath. Rio was on her feet without realizing it, tracking the ball's arc, watching as the Cardinals' center fielder sprinted back, back, back—</span></p><p><span>The ball hit the top of the wall and bounced back into play.</span></p><p><span>"Damn," Rio muttered, sitting back down.</span></p><p><span>"That was close," Agatha said, and she was grinning in a way that suggested she'd enjoyed Rio's momentary hope.</span></p><p><span>"Your outfielder got lucky."</span></p><p><span>"My outfielder is talented."</span></p><p><span>"He's playing four steps too shallow."</span></p><p><span>"Oh, you're one of </span><em><span>those</span></em><span> fans." But Agatha was laughing, and Rio discovered she liked the sound of it. Bright and a little sharp, like Agatha herself.</span></p><p><span>The inning ended without the Cubs scoring, and Rio marked it with more force than strictly necessary. Nicky peered at her scorebook.</span></p><p><span>"You made a sad face," he said, pointing to where Rio had indeed drawn a small frown next to the stranded runner.</span></p><p><span>"That's not official scoring," Rio admitted.</span></p><p><span>"My aunt does that too!" Nicky brightened. "She draws little suns when she's happy and rain clouds when she's sad. Mama says she's got 'personality.'"</span></p><p><span>"Your aunt sounds cool."</span></p><p><span>"She lives far away," Nicky said matter-of-factly. "In... Mama, where does Abuela live?"</span></p><p><span>"New Jersey," Agatha supplied.</span></p><p><span>"That's where we used to live too, but then we moved here for Mama's job and 'cause it was time for an adventure." Nicky had clearly memorized this explanation. "I miss her but Mama says we can visit in the summer."</span></p><p><span>Rio caught the flinch flashing across Agatha’s face before she smoothed it away. Single mom, Rio thought. New to Chicago. Working multiple jobs to afford one day at a baseball game for her kid.</span></p><p><span>And none of it was Rio's business.</span></p><p><span>Except Nicky was already chattering about the next batter, and Agatha was shoulder-to-shoulder with her in the narrow bleacher seats, and Rio's carefully maintained distance felt like it was eroding inning by inning.</span></p><p><span>"Heads up!"</span></p><p><span>The warning came from somewhere to their right, and she spotted the arc of a foul ball, coming fast, heading directly toward their section.</span></p><p><span>Everyone around them was on their feet, hands up, jockeying for position. Rio had been waiting for this moment her entire life. She tracked the ball with the focus of a professional, stepped slightly left, and—</span></p><p><span>The ball smacked into her palm with a satisfying sting.</span></p><p><span>The crowd erupted. People were clapping, shouting, someone was trying to get her attention for a photo. Rio stood there, holding the ball, feeling the leather beneath her fingers, the perfect weight of it. She'd been coming to Wrigley for twenty-five years and had never caught a ball. Never even come close.</span></p><p><span>Her very own piece of the game.</span></p><p><span>She looked down at the ball, at the smudge of infield dirt still on it, the slight scuff where it had connected with the bat. Then she looked at Nicky.</span></p><p><span>He was staring at her with an expression of absolute awe, his mouth hanging open, his foam finger forgotten in his lap.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn't think before holding out the ball to him.</span></p><p><span>"Here."</span></p><p><span>Nicky's eyes went impossibly wider. "For... for me?"</span></p><p><span>"You're the Cardinals fan. Cardinals player hit it." Rio pressed it into his small hands. "Seems like it should be yours."</span></p><p><span>The sound Nicky made was barely human. He clutched the ball to his chest like it was made of gold, looking between Rio and the ball and back again like he couldn't quite process what had just happened.</span></p><p><span>"Mama!" His shriek nearly deafened them all. "Look! Rio gave me the ball! The actual ball they hit!"</span></p><p><span>Agatha had gone very still. When Rio finally looked at her, she found Agatha staring back with something that looked suspiciously like tears in her eyes.</span></p><p><span>"You didn't have to do that," Agatha said, her voice rough.</span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged, uncomfortable with the intensity of Agatha's gaze. "It's just a ball."</span></p><p><span>"It's not." Agatha's hand found Rio's arm and squeezed once. "Thank you."</span></p><p><span>Her hand lingered. Just a second longer than necessary, her thumb brushing against Rio's wrist before she pulled away. But Rio felt it like a brand, a point of blistering heat that had nothing to do with the summer sun and put the stinging in her hand to shame.</span></p><p><span>"Okay," Rio said, because she didn't trust herself to say anything else.</span></p><p><span>Nicky was busy showing the ball to everyone around them, telling the story with elaborate hand gestures and dramatic reenactments of the catch. An older couple behind them congratulated Rio, and she nodded her thanks, but she was hyperaware of Agatha beside her, of the way Agatha kept glancing over at her.</span></p><p><span>It was just a ball, Rio told herself. Just a nice gesture for a kid.</span></p><p><span>But when she returned to her scorebook, she couldn't quite focus on the notation. Her palm still tingled where the ball had struck. And lower, at her wrist, she could still feel the ghost of Agatha's touch.</span></p><p><span>Rio marked the foul ball with an asterisk and a small star.</span></p><p><span>The seventh inning stretch arrived with the warm weight of a summer evening settling over Wrigley. Nicky was on his feet instantly, the baseball clutched carefully in one hand, reaching for Rio with the other.</span></p><p><span>"We gotta sing!" he announced, as if this was very serious business.</span></p><p><span>Rio had done this stretch hundreds of times. It was routine, ritual, part of the game's fabric.</span></p><p><span>But Nicky was belting the words with complete commitment, and Agatha's voice was surprisingly rich and a little smoky. When Rio dared to glance over, Agatha was already looking back, and they were both smiling like idiots.</span></p><p><em><span>If they don't win it's a shame...</span></em></p><p><span>The song ended, and they sat back down, and Rio absolutely did not think about how empty her hand felt now or how Agatha's shoulder was still pressed against hers.</span></p><p><span>"This is the best day ever," Nicky declared to no one and everyone.</span></p><p><span>"Yeah," Agatha said softly, not looking away from Rio. "It really is."</span></p><p><span>Rio cleared her throat and focused very hard on updating her scorebook. The Cubs were up by one. Three innings left. She should be thinking about strategy, about the bullpen, about whether the closer could hold the lead.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she was thinking about the freckle on Agatha's collarbone and whether her hair was always that wild or if the summer humidity was to blame, and what it would be like to hear that smoky voice say her name without a small child between them.</span></p><p><em><span>Focus</span></em><span>, she told herself sternly. </span><em><span>She’s here with her kid don’t be a weirdo.</span></em></p><p><span>But when the eighth inning started and Nicky dozed off against Agatha's shoulder, the excitement and heat finally catching up to him, Rio found her careful focus utterly destroyed.</span></p><p><span>"He's out," Agatha murmured, adjusting Nicky's weight more comfortably across her lap. "I knew this would happen. He hasn't napped since he was three, but apparently baseball is exhausting."</span></p><p><span>"To be fair, he's had an eventful day."</span></p><p><span>"Thanks to you." Agatha stroked Nicky's hair absently. "The scorekeeping lesson. The ball. Not being a dick when you could have been when you got a beer dumped on you… you handled that better than I would have. You've been really kind to us."</span></p><p><span>"It's not—" Rio stopped, unsure what to say. Agatha wasn’t wrong. She'd given up a foul ball she'd wanted her entire life. She'd let a five-year-old interrupt her sacred scorekeeping ritual. She'd taken photos and bought snacks and smiled more in six innings than she usually did in a month.</span></p><p><span>"You love this," Agatha said, gesturing to the field, the scorebook, all of it. "I can tell. This is your thing. And you shared it with a stranger's kid without even blinking. So yeah. Thank you."</span></p><p><span>Rio didn't know what to say to that. She was saved by a Cubs double play that required immediate notation, but when she finished, Agatha was still watching her.</span></p><p><span>"Can I ask you something?" Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>"Sure."</span></p><p><span>"Why'd you give him the ball? And don't say 'it's just a ball,' because we both know that's not true."</span></p><p><span>Rio considered the question, watched the grounds crew rake the infield during the pitching change. "My abuela used to say that baseball is better when you share it. That keeping score alone is fine, but baseball is meant to be witnessed together." She paused. "I guess I wanted him to have something to remember. Something that made today more than just another game."</span></p><p><span>"Mission accomplished," Agatha said softly. "He's going to talk about this until he's forty."</span></p><p><span>"Good."</span></p><p><span>They fell into comfortable silence, watching the game unfold. The Cubs held the lead, but the Cardinals were threatening. Nicky slept on, his fingers still curved protectively around the ball even in sleep.</span></p><p><span>"So," Rio ventured, "the flower shop. You own it?"</span></p><p><span>"God, no. I work there. I'm good with plants, good with people when I need to be." Agatha's smile turned sharp. "And I'm </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> good at reading when someone's trying to impress a mistress versus a wife. The markup on guilt flowers is extraordinary."</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed before she could stop herself. "That's your hustle?"</span></p><p><span>"One of them." Agatha's eyes glinted with mischief and something darker, something that suggested she'd learned to survive however she could. "I do some freelance work on the side. The occasional… let's call it 'creative accounting' for small businesses that need help navigating tax season."</span></p><p><span>"That sounds borderline illegal."</span></p><p><span>"Only borderline." Agatha's expression sobered slightly. "Look, I'm not saying I'm up for sainthood. But I do what I have to do to make sure my kid has food and a roof and sometimes, if I save up enough, a day at the ballpark." She lifted her chin, defiant. "Judge me if you want."</span></p><p><span>"I'm not judging." Rio surprised herself by meaning it. "I think you're resourceful."</span></p><p><span>"That's a diplomatic way of putting it."</span></p><p><span>"I think—" Rio hesitated, then forged ahead. "I think you're a good mom. Nicky's lucky to have you."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's eyes went bright again, and she blinked rapidly, looking away. "Yeah, well. He's pretty great, so I'm very motivated. We bring out the good in each other."</span></p><p><span>The Cubs got out of the jam with a strikeout, and Rio marked it with a flourish. When she looked up, Agatha was smiling at her again.</span></p><p><span>"What?" Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>"Nothing. Just... I'm glad we sat next to you today. That's all."</span></p><p><span>Rio's chest did a complicated flip and she swallowed hard before nodding. "Me too."</span></p><p><span>The ninth inning arrived with the score still close. The Cubs were up by two, but the Cardinals had the top of their order coming up. Nicky stirred as the crowd noise grew, blinking groggily awake.</span></p><p><span>"Did I miss anything?" he mumbled.</span></p><p><span>"No, we told them not to do anything exciting while you slept through the most important inning," his mother teased. "Feel better?"</span></p><p><span>"Yeah." Nicky sat up, stretched, then seemed to remember the ball. He checked that it was still there and relaxed when he found it secure. "Are we winning?"</span></p><p><span>"Not yet," Agatha said. "But we've got a chance."</span></p><p><span>Rio watched the exchange with warmth and pride unfurling in her chest. The gentle teasing, the easy affection, this was what baseball was supposed to be about. Sharing it with people you cared about.</span></p><p><span>Rio had just met them seven innings ago. She had no business feeling this fond, this invested.</span></p><p><span>The Cardinals loaded the bases with one out.</span></p><p><span>"Oh no," Rio muttered.</span></p><p><span>"Oh yes," Agatha countered, her grin wicked.</span></p><p><span>The next batter hit a sacrifice fly. One run scored. Bases cleared, but now it was a one-run game.</span></p><p><span>Rio's pencil hovered over her scorebook. This was it. This was the moment that would define the game. The Cubs closer was on the mound, the Cardinals' best hitter was walking to the plate, and the entire stadium was on its feet.</span></p><p><span>A timeout was called as the pitching coach ran up to the mound.</span></p><p><span>And then, the Jumbotron above center field shifted to show the kiss cam.</span></p><p><span>Rio had seen the tacky ritual dozens of times. It was hokey and performative, and she usually ignored it entirely. But the crowd was cheering, pointing at the screen, and Nicky was tugging at her sleeve.</span></p><p><span>"Rio! Rio, look!"</span></p><p><span>She looked up.</span></p><p><span>And there, on the massive screen, crystal clear and unavoidable, were her face and Agatha's, framed in a bright pink heart.</span></p><p><span>The crowd erupted. People around them were whistling and chanting.</span></p><p><span>Rio's brain short-circuited. She turned to Agatha, meaning to laugh it off, to make some joke about the awkwardness.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was looking at her with an impossible expression. She was clearly amused... but also considering?</span></p><p><span>"Well," Agatha said, her voice pitched low enough that only Rio could hear over the crowd. "May the best team win?"</span></p><p><span>And then Agatha's hand was on Rio's jaw, tilting her face up, and Agatha was kissing her.</span></p><p><span>It was supposed to be performative. A peck for the camera, a moment to satisfy the crowd and move on with their lives. That's what the kiss cam was </span><em><span>for</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha's lips were soft and sure, and she tasted a little like mustard and sunscreen, and Rio's hands came up without permission to grip Agatha's shoulders, and the kiss lingered.</span></p><p><span>When they pulled apart, seconds later, hours later, Rio had no concept of time, the crowd was losing its collective mind. But Rio couldn't hear them. Could barely see anything except Agatha's eyes, dark and pleased, and her smile, small and private.</span></p><p><span>"Wow," Rio managed.</span></p><p><span>"Yeah," Agatha breathed. "Wow."</span></p><p><span>Nicky was bouncing between them, completely delighted. "You kissed! Like in the movies! Does this mean Rio's your—"</span></p><p><span>"Nicky!” Agatha warned, a pretty blush spreading down her neck now.</span></p><p><span>"Girlfriend, because that would be so cool, Mama. She knows about baseball AND she gave me a ball AND she's really pretty!"</span></p><p><span>"Nicholas, we're going to talk about boundaries—"</span></p><p><span>But Rio was laughing, breathless and off-balance and not even bothering to try and look anything other than completely awestruck. "He's not wrong. About the baseball and the ball, I mean. I don’t know about that last part.</span></p><p><span>"You are," Agatha said, her confidence apparently returned. "Really pretty, I mean."</span></p><p><span>Rio's face was absolutely on fire as she tried to stumble through a response.</span></p><p><span>The crack of a bat interrupted them. They both whipped around to see the ball sailing toward the outfield.</span></p><p><span>The center fielder jumped.</span></p><p><span>Game over. A Cubs win.</span></p><p><span>The stadium exploded with noise. Fans were screaming, hugging, and celebrating. Rio should have been on her feet, should have been marking the final out in her scorebook with a triumphant flourish, should have been savoring her team's victory.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she was staring at Agatha, who was staring back, both of them grinning like idiots while Nicky pouted his lower lip over the loss.</span></p><p><span>"I can't believe they won," Agatha said, but she didn't sound upset.</span></p><p><span>"I can't believe you kissed me," Rio replied breathlessly.</span></p><p><span>"Well, you kissed back."</span></p><p><span>"Well." Rio felt reckless, high on adrenaline and baseball, and Agatha's smile as she shrugged. "You're very persuasive."</span></p><p><span>"Mama," Nicky interrupted, tugging at Agatha's sleeve. "Can we come back again? I wanna see if Rio catches another ball."</span></p><p><span>"I don't think—" Agatha started.</span></p><p><span>"Next time I can teach you more scorekeeping," Rio heard herself say. "If you want. Even if we just watch it on TV together."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's eyebrows rose. "Are you asking us on a second date? Because I'm not sure the first one counts when there's a five-year-old chaperone."</span></p><p><span>"Then we should probably fix that." Rio pulled out her phone and pulled up Agatha's contact. "I already have your number. For the photos. But maybe… Could I text you? When Nicky's not around?"</span></p><p><span>"I would like that," Agatha said softly. "I would like that a lot."</span></p><p><span>People were starting to file out, the crowd thinning as the celebration died down. Rio marked the final score in her book with extra care, then added a small heart next to it.</span></p><p><span>They gathered their things slowly, none of them quite ready for the day to end. Nicky was already lobbying for souvenirs from the team store, and Agatha was negotiating with the kind of patience that suggested this was a familiar routine.</span></p><p><span>Rio followed them up the aisle, through the concourse, into the soft summer evening. The sun had set while they were watching the game, and Chicago glowed around them.</span></p><p><span>At the exit, they paused. This was it. The end of the day. The moment they'd go their separate ways.</span></p><p><span>"Text me," Agatha said. It was a command, not a question.</span></p><p><span>"I will," Rio promised.</span></p><p><span>"Tomorrow?"</span></p><p><span>"Tonight. Probably before I’ve made it a whole block away."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's smile could have lit up the entire city. She leaned in, pressed a chaste kiss to Rio's cheek, and murmured, "Good."</span></p><p><span>Nicky launched himself at Rio for a hug, nearly knocking her over. "Thank you for the ball and the scorekeeping and for kissing my mama!"</span></p><p><span>"Nicky!" Agatha looked mortified.</span></p><p><span>But Rio just hugged him back, this tiny human who'd crashed into her life nine innings ago. "Anytime, kiddo."</span></p><p><span>They separated at the corner, Agatha and Nicky heading toward the Red Line, Rio toward her car. Rio turned back once, couldn't help herself.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was already looking back, too.</span></p><p><span>They waved, and Rio felt something settle in her chest. Something warm and right and absolutely terrifying.</span></p><p><span>She pulled out her phone as she walked, already composing a text.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>So about that second date...</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>She hit send before she could second-guess herself, and smiled when the reply came through before she'd even reached her car.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>I thought you'd never ask.</span></em></p></blockquote>
