<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio has been in the Westview National Park for as long as she could remember. The pure essence of nature is her home. The drip of melting dew at dawn, the flutter of wings in the distance and the familiar crunch of pine needles and dry leaves, especially during the summer, under her boots she’d worn through three times took care of her. This is her world, and she wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p>By the time the sun peeks through the horizon of the mountains to the east, Rio already checked the fence and radioed in a bear sighting to the head ranger, Lilia Calderu. The call went unanswered, as most did, but she didn’t mind. She doesn’t mind the silence, it’s rare for someone to make the difficult trek to her neck of the woods, even the most experienced hikers.</p><p>Her parents of course hoped she’d take over the whole park - Lilia even offered the position to her straight out of high school - but Rio didn’t want the irritability of the meetings or bureaucratic nightmare of funding to ruin her relationship with Westview. </p><p>As she hikes up shore from the nearby river, the radio on Rio’s hip crackles to life. </p><p>“Good morning Lady Death, you up?” Alice asks. She was one of the few full-time staff under Lilia that she was training for her inevitable retirement. Rio likes Alice, even if they’ve only met at most ten times, but still, she’s happy that the future of this park is going to someone dedicated to protecting the environment as she knows Alice will.</p><p>“Since before the sun champ,” Rio responds.</p><p>“Good, head’s up, a traveler is headed your way. Male around 5 '11, brown hair, brown eyes, lean build,” Alice reports neutrally.</p><p>Rio pauses. She hasn’t had anyone her way all summer and she was hoping she’d add another busy season to her streak but this damn kid just had to go and break it. She checks her watch, reading 10:15 a.m. and groans.</p><p>“Is he lost?” </p><p>“No, but he might be if he’s going down The Road. Solo traveler I tried to recommend an easier trail but he seemed oddly determined for this particular path.”</p><p>Rio exhales.</p><p>Of course, leave it to a man who’s overconfident in his abilities to venture one of the deadliest hiking paths in the U.S.</p><p>“Got it, I’ll keep an eye out for him.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Alice says. After thirty seconds of no follow up, Rio returns to the river before her.</p><p>She hikes her way through the familiar roots of the windy trail known as The Road back to her home. It was more a legend than a trail really. It curved gently along the mountainside like it was always there, waiting for the next hiker to test their endurance. No one had for a long while, some were ambitious and tried to venture down past the extremely narrow ridge but as soon as they saw the deep drop off, they decided they valued their life and turned back. Those who were brave enough to try their luck beyond were rewarded with the beautiful untouched essence of nature. </p><p>And that’s exactly where Rio’s cabin resides. </p><p>It’s a small, sturdy, and inconspicuous structure that no one knows exist unless they’re looking for it. From above, it’s nearly hidden in the tree line of the forest - shaded by the tall evergreens, blanketed in a protective layer of moss that’s older than Rio herself; like nature has adapted to it, tucking it into its side and protecting it like it’s precious secret.</p><p>The interior is modest: aged timber walls, a slanted tin roof that’s patched over after years of wear and tear with a narrow porch just wide enough for a chair and a hammock. The only way to access her cabin is a path that winds off The Road, veering down the opposite side of the ridge where hikers don’t think to look. Rio prefers it this way.</p><p>By midday, the sun hangs high and heavy, casting sharp shadows across the shoreline of the forest floor. </p><p>Rio sits on the edge of her porch, arms dangling by her side and legs crossed over the banister. Normally she’d be deep into her patrol routes - checking the waterline, monitoring nesting grounds, clearing the windfall off the Road itself, but today she’s stuck watching the ridge, waiting for the idiotic teenager to maybe not get himself killed.</p><p>Hours pass. The forest is still. Most would call its silence unsettling, but to Rio it’s comforting. She even feels a little FOMO from the trees, but despite her demeanor, she has a heart and doesn’t want this idiot to die on her watch.</p><p>She checks the ridge, then her watch again. Nothing.</p><p>Usually by now Alice or Lilia even would’ve radioed in, signaling that the ambitious hikers have returned and she’s free of her temporary but necessary duty of watch dog but she hasn't received any call.</p><p>Then, she sees him through her binoculars.</p><p>The rustling branches in the distance are as unnatural as pigs flying and a boy emerges in her line of sight. He may <em> look </em> the part of an experienced hiker, packed with all the right equipment, but Rio can see the inexperienced naivety in his features. His eyes dance the horizon as he takes in his reward for this dangerously beautiful journey. He snaps a few photos on an old camera of the picturesque view and Rio expects him to turn back around. There’s not much more to capture but instead he proves his insanity, when he puts away the vintage device and starts to cross the narrow walkway.</p><p>She can see the tension in his shoulders, uncertainties dripping from his facial features and something in Rio snaps.</p><p>Rio snatches her radio and a tether, then bolts towards the ridge.</p><p>To any stranger they’d be lost in an instant, but Rio knows these paths like the back of her hand, and knows the shortcuts in order to reach him in the fastest time.</p><p>Within ten minutes she reaches the ridge and freezes. She’s horrified when she sees him dangling off the edge of the bedrock. In an instant, she ties the rope to a nearby tree trunk and slinks down the mountainside to secure the kid. It’s a hasty knot but she doesn't have time to worry about that, his grip was already slipping.</p><p>“You're going to be okay, just grab onto the rope and pull yourself up,” she instructed.</p><p>He does exactly that and pulls himself over the edge. </p><p>“Okay don't-”</p><p>The next thing she knows she’s plummeting a good twenty feet. She doesn't remember hitting the jagged rock, just the distinct crack somewhere in her body before slamming into a flat stone below.</p><p>Rio’s senses are immediately muddled, a sharp ringing in her ears. Then fire immediately radiates throughout her lungs but she can't focus on that right now, what matters is making sure the kid isn't the next to follow.</p><p>She tries to sit up, but the fire burns hotter everywhere in her body, pain soaring through her side. Her breaths are jagged, sharp, and shallow, like she can't get enough oxygen on her own. The taste of copper floods her mouth. <em> Shit. This is NOT how I die. </em></p><p>The most she can muster is angling her neck uncomfortably where she can see his head over the edge, eyes wide, frozen.</p><p>“Hey!” Her voice is hoarse, but she simply wills the adrenaline through her body. “Back up! Get away from the edge!” </p><p>He doesn't move, if anything he becomes more blurred. Everything hurts, but she tries again.</p><p>“Go! Get a ranger! Get help!” She finally sees his blurry head nod and disappear off in the distance.</p><p>Rio can't take it anymore, the fire is too hot, the copper too bitter, the breaths too shallow. She doesn't know how much time has passed, but slowly everything fades to black. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>Everything is black and heavy, then she hears it - a faint beep cutting through the void. It’s rhythmic, mechanical. Stable. Like a metronome in the distance. It anchors her, pulling her closer to something she can't put her finger on yet.</p><p>Then the voices cane, muted and distorted. Like it’s underwater. Floating, she thinks she is, or drowning. She can't tell which way is up but still, she swims. </p><p>She doesn't know how many but she recognizes one of them as the kid she saved. </p><p>“It happened so fast. One minute she’s there, the next- she saved me.”</p><p>The rest doesn't matter, he’s safe.</p><p>She lets herself float in the darkness for a little while longer. </p><p>The voices still come and go.</p><p>“O2 levels are stable.”</p><p>“Bleeding has ceased.”</p><p>“We can take her off sedation, she might wake in the morning.”</p><p>The water feels lighter, more shallow like a wave bringing her to shore. This time, she rides the wave to shore.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>White is the first thing Rio sees as her eyelids flutter open. </p><p>The beeping is the first thing she hears, though no longer muffled, but crystal clear, and loud. Alive.</p><p>Her throat burns, her chest heavy, like a cinder block is laid over her body. Every inhale is labored, but she feels the flow of oxygen through her nose, and can trace it down to her lungs.</p><p>A shadow moves at the edge of her vision, a chair scraping against the floor like nails on chalkboard. Then a voice.</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>She knows that voice.</p><p>She turns her head ever so slightly, the dull ache restraining most of her movements, but she does it anyway.</p><p>“You're awake.”</p><p>It’s quiet, cautious, full of disbelief.</p><p>“Did- did the kid make it?” Her voice is scratchy, like the rocks found a place there.</p><p>“Thanks to you,” he says, eyes softening.</p><p>Relief loosens every muscle in Rio’s body. She stops resisting the pain, letting the exhaustion in her body close her heavy eyelids. The last thing she remembers is him fumbling for the call button.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>The next time she wakes, it’s quiet. </p><p>No beeping or voices, just the quiet shuffle of footsteps muffled by the glass she can't see.</p><p>Her eyelids are slow to open, they feel lighter than they were the last time. The light isn't blinding, just a soft dim glow illuminating the room in a gentle haze.</p><p>She blinks, and then she notices the shadow in the chair nearby. It’s not him, but a woman sitting cross legged in a tailored suit. She’s reading over a tablet with a kind of poise that makes the silence feel deliberate.</p><p>The sudden movement jerks her attention away from the device, towards the patient in the bed, and her features soften.</p><p>“You’re awake.” Her voice is low and smooth. Controlled, like someone meant to capture attention.</p><p>Rio doesn't answer right away. Her throat is still dry, like it’s filled with cigarette ashes.</p><p>“Don’t. You’ve been through hell and back.”</p><p>She doesn't listen. She shifts to sit up and instantly regrets it. A sharp, searing pain shoots through her entire side and she almost blacks out at the sensation.</p><p>She falls back, breathing shallow. Her right arm is retained in a sling, cradling her chest.</p><p>The woman stands up, pressing a button nearby and immediately the pain settles her body.</p><p>“Where…” Rio doesn't recognize her own voice.</p><p>“Private practice,” she says. “You’ve been here for two weeks.”</p><p>Her eyes widened at the revelation. She cranes her head again, noticing the sterile elegance of the room. She swallows, hard.</p><p>“The kid…”</p><p>“Unharmed, thanks to you. He’ll be back, needed to go shower.”.</p><p>“Why are you here?”</p><p>“Someone needed to make sure you stayed alive,” she stands from her chair, readjusting her suit. “Rest, you’ll need it,” was all she said before leaving the room. Rio stares after her, the room falling silent except for the steady beeping coming from the monitor next to her.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>A while later, a real doctor finally comes through to her room.</p><p>“Hi Rio. I’m Dr. Jennifer Kale. I’ll be overseeing your treatment. How would you rate your pain on a scale of one to ten?”</p><p>“About a 9 doc.”</p><p>She nods, writing something on the tablet in her hand and Rio’s eyebrows scrunch. “You’re lucky, a fall like that could've killed you. You suffered two fractured ribs, and a dislocated shoulder. It’s going to take you time to heal and you’ll need physical therapy for your shoulder. In the meantime, the best thing you can do for yourself is rest, we’ll manage your pain here and ensure everything heals properly.”</p><p>Rio nods, trying to process it all. Her mind is still foggy and she feels like she can only process about seventy-percent of what she was just told.</p><p>“You’ve been here for two weeks now,” right. That’s what the woman had said. “We’ll keep you here a few more days for observation, make sure everything is on track. Then we can discuss your discharge.”</p><p>“Discharge?” Rio echoes. “I don't live in the city.”</p><p>“Agatha’s told me to tell you not to worry about that, or the cost of your stay.”</p><p>She’s too tired to argue, or to even ask who this Agatha person is, so she only nods.</p><p>Dr. Kale moves to the monitor by her bed, writing down more notes then heads to the door.</p><p>“Seriously, rest. I’ll be back to check in later.”</p><p>With the soft click of the door, Rio’s mind is left racing with a million thoughts and a million more questions, none of which she has the energy to chase.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>The kid comes back a little while later, with a bag in tow. He takes a double step when he feels Rio staring at him, perplexed.</p><p>“You’re awake,” he says. It’s quiet, familiar, filled with breathy joy. “I have snacks if you're hungry, the hospital food is shit.”</p><p>“Thanks kid,” she rasps though she’s not sure she can stomach anything more than ice chips right now.</p><p>“I should be the one thanking you,” he replies, eyes suddenly distant. There’s something haunted in the way he says it, like he’s replayed the fall a million times. “I’m Nicky by the way. Agatha told me to give you this.”</p><p>He rummages through his bag and pulls out a sleek tablet, like the one the woman had.</p><p>“Agatha?” She reaches for the device and stares blankly. The name rattles around her head, like it should mean something.</p><p>“Yeah, my mom. She’s at work right now but wants you to have it.”</p><p>She inspects the device, it’s light, not too heavy. On the back there’s a distinct ‘H’ in the center carved through the smooth silver metal. The screen illuminates life with a simple background, a mountain backdrop and for the first time, Rio misses home.</p><p>Rio hums her thanks to Nicky. He takes a seat nearby and opens a bag of chips.</p><p>“So, did Jen catch you up on everything?” She nods. </p><p>“Yeah, she said a few more days to make sure I’m healing properly.”</p><p>“Cool, she mentioned you’ll need physical therapy. My mom’s already got a place lined up.”</p><p>There’s pride in the way he relays the information, soft, but she can hear beneath the surface that it sounds distant.</p><p>“She did all that for me?”</p><p>“Yeah, she’s thorough. What she says goes,” he shrugs like he’s used to it. He shakes his head out of his thoughts. “So, what do you want to watch?”</p><p>“Uhm, something light, easy.”</p><p>He nods, like he isn’t expecting anything else. Nicky unlocks the tablet in her hands and props it up on the table tray. He opens an app and scrolls until he finds a show that Rio doesn't recognize. To be honest, she doesn’t recognize any of it. The pictures move so fast that she doesn’t have time to register each option on the screen.</p><p>Eventually he lands on a show about a group of detectives in the city and Rio’s already lost the plot. Things are happening so fast on screen, there’s so many characters with varying personalities, but the distraction is nice. It’s a funny show, she realizes, but with each chuckle, there’s a sharp pain that comes through her chest. Nicky doesn’t seem to notice however, he’s too busy watching the show.</p><p>She doesn’t know how many episodes pass before exhaustion wafts over her eyelids again. Rio closes them, still trying to hear what’s going on, but sleep wins in the end.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>The next time Rio wakes, Agatha is back. She’s not in a suit this time, only a pair of slacks and a loose cardigan. <em> It must be the weekend</em>. </p><p>The tablet on her table is shut off and laid down on the table. She doesn’t know what time it is, but the sun beaming through the window by her bed still shines brightly.</p><p>“Good morning,” she says. Gone is the authoritative voice Rio heard the other day, and replaced is one of calm, composed, gentle.</p><p>Rio blinks at her, eyes still adjusting to the light. “Morning?”</p><p>“You were out for a while. Nicky said you laughed at the show, he’ll take it as a win.”</p><p>Rio hums faintly at the memory. She remembers detectives, she remembers laughing, she remembers the pain. “Hurt like a bitch.”</p><p>Agatha sets her tablet down and leans forward on her elbows. “Jen said the discharge procedure will be ready by tomorrow night.”</p><p>Rio takes a shallow breath. Relief floods her system, glad to be free of these machines and the endless nothing, then fear bobs in her throat. She doesn’t know if she can face the park or the town.</p><p>Agatha seems to catch the flicker of tension in Rio’s jaw. “You don’t have to go back right away,” her voice is smooth, measured. “You’ll need time and privacy.”</p><p>Rio scoffs lightly. “And where am I going to get that?”</p><p>“With me.”</p><p>She huffs a small breath, too dry and painful to be real, but it’s something. “Why?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t flinch, she expected the resistance, but she remained undeterred in her decision. “Because, you saved someone important to me. And you’re going to need help, something tells me you’ll only re-injure yourself if you were left alone.”</p><p>The silence prolongs. Rio finally breaks the eye contact she was holding with Agatha and turns away. “I’m not some fix-it charity case.”</p><p>“I never said you were.” Her voice doesn’t waiver, it’s patient, reassuring.</p><p>“I’m not good with favors.”</p><p>“It’s a good thing this isn’t one,” Agatha goes to stand once again. “I’ll have a car ready tomorrow afternoon. Jen will be in later to bring in some of the paperwork and go over details.”</p><p>She straightens her sweater out, her silhouette sharp against the light lavender wall. </p><p>“You always this generous with strangers?” She asks, not accusatory, simply curious.</p><p>Agatha pauses at the handle, her breath hitching slightly. “You’re not a stranger,” and she was gone.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The sun has disappeared behind the dark clouds and she can hear rain pellets against the glass outside. Nicky comes back in a purple NYU hoodie, the hood soaked through and another bag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Last night here, you excited to finally ditch this joint?” He smiles at the prospect of spending more time with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah kid.” Rio’s smile doesn’t exactly reach her eyes, but it’s there, subtle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not a kid, I’m nineteen, I turn twenty in November,” he jests. Rio’s mind is still foggy. She just shrugs at the information. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shouldn’t you be in school?” Her eyes drift down to his hoodie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky returns the shrug. “Doesn’t start till next week, but even then, I’m taking independent studies so I’ll still be around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you in for?” She asks, intrigued. She wonders if he takes after his mom, she’s still not quite sure what Agatha does for work, maybe a lawyer, definitely someone with authority. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Film.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This takes Rio by surprise, she expected something authoritative with big suits and a briefcase. Something like his mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, he pulls the tablet from his bag and props it up on the table, like he did last time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Figured we’d get another few episodes in,” he queues up the same show, something titled Brooklyn something and hits resume.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio still has no idea what’s going on in the show, but the humor is much appreciated. She knows that not all police precincts are run like the one in the show. It’s definitely more lively than the one in Westview. She’s pretty sure the last time they were involved was when Mrs. Davis, the mayor’s wife, called them trying to get a cat out from a tree.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the credits roll on the episode, he pauses. His voice cuts through the sound of trumpets coming from the speakers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey - what’s Westview like year-round?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turns her head towards him, blinking in surprise. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He shrugs, still looking at the tablet. “I’ve been going ever since I was a kid. Mama took me a couple times a year. I noticed it hasn’t really changed over the years.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales, a short laugh. It doesn't hurt as much as the previous day, but a dull ache still radiates throughout her chest. “That’s not far off.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you miss it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Every day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He hums, clearly dissatisfied with her answer but doesn’t press. Instead, he hits play on the next episode, but her mind isn’t focused on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In her head, she’s back in her cabin, where nature fills her senses. She longs for the smell of pine, the feel of natural wood, the gravel beneath her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hasn’t realized she’s dozed off until the roaring thunder outside wakes her up. Nicky’s still by her bedside, headphones in, watching something else on the tablet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shifts slightly, wincing at the movement. Her eyes drift to the rain outside. She feels like a fish out of water, boxed in by the fluorescent light and the lavender walls and artificial ceiling tiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back home, storms didn’t sound like this. They were calm, she could see the clouds moving through the sky, sometimes at a fast pace, other times agonizingly slow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she closes her eyes and for a moment, she’s back on her porch, with a chipped mug in hand and damp wooden planks beneath her bare feet, the sound of rain pelting the natural earth and the rush of the stream through the thunder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales slowly, letting herself stay there for a little while longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft knock on her door pulls her back to reality. Nicky’s eyes dart up to the nurse entering the room and he moves off to the side, out of her way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Rio, how are you feeling?” Her voice is sweet, like honey she thinks, but she supposes that’s her job.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I fell twenty feet,” she jokes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that did happen. time for meds.” She takes the I.V. line in her arm and pushes a needle into it and replaces the saline bag hanging on the hook. “You’re confirmed to be released tomorrow afternoon, is someone going to be here to pick you up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be here,” Nicky speaks up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good, it’s nice to have someone to look after you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m mostly here for snacks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolls her eyes but grins, barely. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The medication hits her system like a soothing massage. She hates it, she can’t wait until she’s off of it completely. She doesn’t like not being able to feel things properly, being reliant on machines and foreign drugs in order to simply exist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, I’ll leave you two to get back to it. Press the call button if you need anything and get some rest. You’ll need it for tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, she’s gone. Rio’s head rolls back against the crunchy pillow, her mind getting lost in the haze of medication.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky resumes whatever he’s watching but Rio lets the weight of the medication pull her back to slumber.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, as discussed you’re scheduled to start PT next week. You should take these twice a day at first, then as needed with food,” Dr. Kale instructs, her tone unwavering and firm. She places several orange pill bottles on the table next to Rio’s bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans against the far wall of the room, arms crossed, listening with intent as her old friend hands the bottle over to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She nods in affirmation under the sharp gaze of her now guardian, she awkwardly signs the release forms with her non-dominant hand and Dr. Kale leaves the room. Agatha offers a quiet “Thanks Jen,” which takes Rio back slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have some clothes for you,” Agatha says, picking up a rugged duffel back from the floor and bringing it to Rio’s bedside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she rummages through, she’s surprised to see familiar flannels and sweatpants and a few photos tucked away in the side pockets. Her chest tightens - someone went to her home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had Lilia get some of your clothes and personal items from your cabin when I called her and explained everything. Sent a helicopter so no one had to hike down. Didn’t want to risk it,” she explains when she catches the look on Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulls out a faded green Westview National Park zip up hoodie and slips her good arm through the sleeve, letting the other side drape her sling. It’s awkward, not ideal, but it smells like pine and rain, home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shimmies into a pair of loose sweatpants with quiet determination. Agatha watches, mildly amused, but stays where she is. She doesn’t offer help. Not yet. Not unless Rio asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wants her to feel like herself again, even just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It takes longer than Rio would like to get moving. She swings her legs over the edge of the bed slowly, every muscle groaning in protest. The tile is cool under her bare feet. Too clean, too smooth, too unfamiliar. She pulls out a pair of old worn slides, the foam bringing her more comfort than she realizes. Agatha moves to her side without a word, letting her get there on her own terms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They don’t speak much as they make their way through the halls of the private practice. Just the soft squeak of sneakers on the floor and the low hum of the lights filling the silence. Nicky had left earlier to pull the car around. Rio’s glad, she hates the thought of him seeing her like this: slow, small, weaker than she’s used to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, the rain has settled to a mist, just enough to dot the pavement and she can see the small dots against the cotton. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A sleek black car with tinted windows sits at the curb, engine running, door already open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha steadies her gently with one hand at Rio’s back. “Watch your step,” she murmurs. It’s not a command, just a presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods and leans into the motion as she angles herself into the seat. The firm leather below her is cool to her touch. Every small shift sends a new wave of pain throughout her ribs and shoulder, but Agatha doesn’t rush her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she’s in, Agatha reaches across her chest and buckles the estbelt, careful not to jostle her arm. Their faces are close for a moment, breath mingling in the narrow space between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Comfortable?” Agatha asks softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales through her nose. “Define comfortable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small smirk tugs at Agatha’s lips. “Survivable, then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Barely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closes the door with care, circling to the driver's side. When she slides in and pulls away from the curb, Rio lets her head rest against the cool surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The car hums beneath them, a low, steady rhythm that almost lulls Rio back to sleep. She watches as raindrops chase each other across the glass, her breath fogging a small crescent against the window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands stay steady on the wheel, her knuckles relaxed, but her eyes flick to the mirror every few minutes, checking on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You doing okay?” She asks eventually, voice low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t open her eyes. “I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A short pause engulfs the car. Nicky is busy on his phone, typing away and the soft clicking of the keys keeps Rio awake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to pretend,” Agatha adds, softer this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opens her eyes again, gaze still trained on the misty concrete jungle blurring by. “I’m not pretending. I’m just tired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, understanding threaded through the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want music?” She asks after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something calm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nudges Nicky’s side and he immediately connects his phone to the bluetooth in the car. Instantly, a loud bass thrumming jolts through the speakers, making Rio wince and Agatha shoot her son a pointed look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry! Sorry, wrong playlist,” Nicky fumbles, panicked, scrolling wildly. “Sorry, sorry- hang on-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bass cuts, replaced by the soft strum of an acoustic guitar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales, eyes fluttering shut again. “Better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky slinks down in his seat. “Thought I had the right one queued up. My bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shakes her head, the smallest smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. “You had one job Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was an honest mistake. Besides, technically you didn’t say no to trap remixes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs a quiet laugh from the backseat. “That would’ve definitely sent me back to the hospital.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The car settles again into calm, the music weaving through the hum of tires on wet pavement. Agatha drives on, steady and quiet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t remember falling asleep, but she wakes to the soft click of the car shifting into park and another dim, overhead light. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinks slowly, groggy and disoriented. She feels trapped again when she sees concrete at every corner. Her head is still against the window, chilled glass pressed to her temple. The walls of the parking garage are smooth concrete, clean and well-lit, not a speck of grime in sight. She catches a glimpse at a few other cars parked in the area but her mind is focused elsewhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s already stepped out of the driver’s seat, her door closing with a muffled thud. She rounds the car and opens Rio’s, peering in gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she says, soft enough not to startle. “We’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s here?” Rio asks, voice thick with sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My place. Penthouse. Elevator’s over there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts and winces, her body stiff and aching from the drive and awkward position. “Of course you live in a penthouse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks. “Would you expect anything less?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky hops out and opens the trunk, already gathering bags. “Come on, it’s got the best view of the skyline and a bathtub that could probably heal broken bones.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not medically accurate,” Agatha calls over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then build one mama.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio allows herself to be helped out of the car, trying not to lean too much on Agatha, but falls a little. Agatha steadies her with one arm around her back, carefully keeping pressure off her injured side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a short ride,” she reassures Rio, pressing the button for the private lift. “After, you can rest somewhere that doesn’t smell artificial.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator dings, sleek and silent, doors sliding open like something out of a sci-fi film. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks from the elevator, to Agatha, expression unreadable. “This is your way of keeping an eye on me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glances back. “You say that like I’m subtle.” Then gentler. “I just figured you’d be more comfortable somewhere that’s not… alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t answer right away. She just steps into the elevator, letting the soft lights warm her skin as the doors close behind them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Besides, you think Dottie can fix you up and put you right back into that park in one piece?” Agatha adds after the elevator shoots up, smoothly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know Dottie?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately.” That garners a chuckle from Rio. The town doctor was more the town gossip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator slows, then settles with a gentle chime. The doors slide open to reveal an expansive modern penthouse framed by floor-to-ceiling windows. Warm lighting glows against dark wood floors and a long wall of built-in bookshelves. The city skyline sprawls out beyond the glass, lights flickering like stars beneath a cloudy sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Home sweet home,” Agatha says, stepping out and holding the door for Rio. “You want the tour now, or later?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Later, I really need to be horizontal again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks lightly. “Come, guest room’s this way.” She picks up the bag that Nicky dropped by the couch and leads her down a hall. There’s artwork lining the creme colored walls and even a few photographs of Agatha and Nicky. Some older, some more recent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opens a door at the end of the hall. “Here, you can stay here as long as you need.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio steps inside the large bedroom. It’s probably the size of her own cabin, she estimates. A giant king bed with soft sheets, topped with a few throw blankets, windows cracked just rough to let the city sound in like a whisper. She notices a scent plugged into the outlet, it reminds her of home. It wasn’t necessary, but a thoughtful touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha places the bag on the bed and pulls out a remote. Rio notices a huge flatscreen t.v. on the opposite wall. It flickers to life similar to the tablet the other day and there’s a rolling image of the same mountain backdrop she’d seen on the smaller device.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Figured you’d want something familiar,” Agatha says casually, like she didn’t go out of her way to make this space feel like home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows, the knot in her throat tight. “You didn’t have to do all of this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha meets her gaze, something unreadable in her eyes. “Yes I did.” She places the remote on the nightstand, then gestures towards the door on one of the walls. “Bathroom’s through that door, towels are in the closet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods, a quiet kind of gratitude passing between them. She moves over to the bed, the soft silk sheets beneath her fingers, like it’s sacred. She knows she needs to shower, but she truly doesn’t have the energy for that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lingers for a beat, then steps back toward the door. “I’ll let you get settled.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sinks down onto the bed, her good arm bracing her while the other stays tucked in its sling. For a moment, she lets herself relax into the no doubt expensive mattress, the weight of the day pressing into the plush comfort beneath her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha reaches the hallway, Rio looks up. “Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pauses, leaning into the doorframe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t say anything right away. She holds Agatha’s gaze in the dim, warm light. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” she says, her voice light, exhaustion seeping through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles, a real one. “You’re welcome, I’ll let you know when dinner’s ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaves the door cracked open, but it’s not entirely necessary. Rio noticed there weren’t any other doors nearby and it was far enough away from the kitchen that she couldn’t hear anything in the distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She peeled the sweatshirt off her body and let the cool silk sheets ice her skin.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Muffled voices wake Rio from her nap. She opens her eyes, disoriented and takes in the room she’s in. It’s not the hospital, she remembers, but Agatha’s guest room.</p><p>She’s reluctant to get out of bed, but she really needs to go to the bathroom. She’s sluggish, peeling the sheets off herself and for the first time, she sees the extent of the damage done to her body.</p><p>A deep purple bruise covers the length of her torso, beneath her sling and wraps around to her backside. Groaning, she lifts herself from the bed and makes her way to the bathroom. It’s simple, white marble floors with natural light wood cabinets, a large shower in the corner and an exterior bathtub opposite it. The lights flicker on automatically and Rio sees herself for the first time.</p><p>Her hair is ragged, bags under her eyes extremely pronounced, but the bruise is what scares her the most. She twists herself rather uncomfortably around, to see the extent of the damage and sees that it stops just before her spine. Shit. She groans at the sight of it as a wave of nausea rolls through her body. She swallows it down, almost positive the feeling of throwing up is going to hurt worse than just seeing a bruise.</p><p>After an embarrassingly long bathroom trip, Rio finds the hoodie she tossed earlier and covers her body again. She’s never been self conscious about her body, not that she has much of an audience, but she takes great pride in looking after it.</p><p>Anger rips through her core, her good hand gripping the countertop so hard her knuckles turn white. She’s angry at herself for not tying the knot properly, angry at the bedrock for not killing her right then and there, angry at- no. She’s not angry at Agatha for offering her sanctuary.</p><p>She doesn’t even know Agatha that well and still somehow, she sees through Rio. It’s in the small things. The mountain wallpaper, the pine scent in her room, knowing that she’d want her own clothes in a place foreign to her.</p><p>Rio wipes the tears from her eyes and makes her way down the hall. The voices become more clear, they sound sharper than she’d ever heard them before.</p><p>“Nicky, for the millionth time. It’s just a myth-”</p><p>“How do you know that huh? Your fancy tech tell you that?” Nicky snaps back.</p><p>Rio hides behind the corner extremely confused at what’s going on in the kitchen.</p><p>“Because I just know,” Agatha convicts. If she were a lawyer, she’d have won over the jury with that sentence alone.</p><p>Nicky grunts but doesn’t say anything more. Rio hears the slam of his door echo throughout the large space. When she rounds the corner, she sees Agatha doubled over on the kitchen island, head in her hands.</p><p>“How much of that did you hear?” She asks through her hands. </p><p>“Not much to be honest, I have no idea what it was about but it sounded heated,” Rio remarks, leaning against the wall. </p><p>“Kid’s going to kill himself for a fairytale, I swear to god,” she grumbles, then picks her head up and returns to the stove top. “He’s been asking about Lady Death.” Agatha says, head ducked.</p><p>Rio stops in her tracks, unsure how to proceed; she hadn't even known Agatha was aware of the legend</p><p>Agatha turns slightly, giving Rio a wink that only leaves her more confused than when she entered the kitchen.</p><p>“Later,” she mouths. Rio nods and sits on a barstool.</p><p>“What are you making?” </p><p>“Soup, figured you’d want something light.”</p><p>The front of Rio’s sweatshirt falls open and Agatha catches a glimpse at the bruise and frowns. “After dinner, I’ll get you some ice for that.”</p><p>“Thanks, do you need help?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “The only help you can give is to sit back and relax.” </p><p>Rio huffs lightly, but relents and watches Agatha in the kitchen. It’s mesmerizing, the way she commands a room, even if she’s the only occupant. She would’ve thought that someone with as much money as she has, Agatha would've paid someone else to cook for her, but she’s wrong.</p><p>She ladles a portion of chicken soup into a bowl and slides it across the island to Rio and a piece of bread.</p><p>Agatha's gaze is sharp, watching Rio struggle to feed herself. She wishes she could do more for her, but she refuses to overstep a boundary. </p><p>Rio feels the eyes on her and she speaks up. “I don't need a watchdog.”</p><p>There’s something about the way she says it. Her words are sharp, but not lethal. Still, Agatha doesn't waver, she watches Rio with patience and understanding.</p><p>She joins her shortly after, reading over that same tablet. </p><p>They eat in relative silence, the tension from Nicky’s departure still looming in the air.</p><p>“Hey can I borrow your phone?” Rio asks when she’s done with her bowl.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrow. For a brief moment, Rio thinks she’s asked too much.</p><p>“Sure, only after you’ve taken your meds and iced your ribs.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, but eventually agrees. </p><p>Agatha grabs a bag of ice, a towel and disappears into her room briefly, reappearing with another blanket. She beckons Rio to follow her back to the guest room.</p><p>She lays the blanket on top of the sheets, towel on top and tells Rio to lie down. “It’s a cooling blanket, should help with the back half of that bruise.”</p><p>Rio has to admit, the ice instantly soothes her backside and her front. That, in combination with the very strong medication, the touch of her skin is numb.</p><p>Agatha pulls her phone out of her back pocket. Before Rio can grab it, she snatches it back. “Who are you calling?”</p><p>“What? You think I’m gonna call the cops on you?” </p><p>“There’s sensitive information on this device, I have a right to know,” Agatha shrugs, a hint of a smile breaking through her resolve.</p><p>“I don't even own a smartphone genius, Lilia forgot to pack my phone.” That takes Agatha by surprise, but still she unlocks it and pulls up the digital keypad.</p><p>Rio types in a number, and she’s surprised when a contact with that same number is already saved.</p><p>“Uhm, why is Lilia’s number saved as ‘kooky witch’?”</p><p>“Is she not?” Agatha says it like it’s the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>Rio doesn't disagree, but she also does not dignify that with a response. She taps the dial button and waits for an answer.</p><p>The device rings three times before she picks up.</p><p>“I’ve already told you Harkness, no I will not accept payment.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Rio?"</p><p>“Yeah- hi.”</p><p>“Oh thank the divine mother. It’s good to hear your voice.”</p><p>Rio’s heart tugs at the affection. She doesn't realize how much she’s missed Lilia until now. Agatha backs out of the room, signaling she’ll be right outside to give Rio some privacy.</p><p>“How are you dear?” She can hear the concern in her boss’ voice and she hates that it’s there in the first place.</p><p>“I’m alive.”</p><p>“Thank heavens for that. You gave us all a fright, I’m pretty sure Dottie had a heart attack when you rolled through the ER.”</p><p>“Oh boy, what does the house look like?”</p><p>“Honestly pretty beautiful, flowers everywhere, looks straight out of a magazine.”</p><p>Rio’s mind eases, knowing that she’s still cared for even if she’s physically absent most of the year. “I’m glad to hear that, it’s a shame they’ll probably die before I get back.”</p><p>“Don't you worry about rushing anything. These things take time,” Lilia reassures gently. “How’s the penthouse? Is Nicky doing alright?”</p><p>“Impressive, and yeah I think. Kid wouldn't leave my bedside. I just wanted to say thank you for getting my things, though you forgot my actual phone.”</p><p>“I tried looking for it, but I couldn't find it anywhere,” she defends. “It wasn't a problem, Agatha figured you’d want a piece of home.”</p><p>“It was Agatha’s idea?”</p><p>“All of it: your transfer, payment, housing you. I would’ve done it myself but she made some good points about the government's lack of funding and Dottie’s bedside manner.” </p><p>Guilt twists through Rio’s core. She’ll never be able to repay Agatha’s hospitality. It’s then replaced with something else, something warm that settles knots. </p><p>“I can’t believe I’m saying this right now, but I miss that damn diner.”</p><p>“It’ll be here when you heal.” Lilia emphasizes the last word and another wave of something crashes through Rio. Homesickness? Dread? She can't tell.</p><p>“I know. Also, Nicky’s been asking about Lady Death,” Rio informs.</p><p>Lilia hesitates briefly. “Is Agatha there?”</p><p>“No, she’s outside.”</p><p>“Call her in-”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Just do it.”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>She enters not a moment later, like she was expecting the call. She places herself at the edge of the bed and takes the phone from Rio, putting it on speaker phone.</p><p>“Harkness speaking.”</p><p>“It’s just me, you don't need to go all corporate on me,” Lilia chides. “I think it’s time to share the true origin of Lady Death.”</p><p>“You sure?” Agatha asks. Rio’s eyebrows raise in confusion.</p><p>A little more than two decades ago, the lead ranger gave Rio an idea for that year’s Halloween to change things up. It was simple, walk the paths at night - something Rio already did - and place ominous signs and omens around campsites. Rio’s reluctant to admit that she’s grown to love the scheme; the change in her routine was refreshing, and she got to give campers flowers from more remote areas of the woods. Eventually Rio found an old mask and dagger, and a dark robe in her parents’ attic, and Lady Death was born. Hikers returned with their trophies and tales, and news spread like wildfire.</p><p>“What are you talking about? Lilia, I thought you said the idea came to you in a dream?” Rio asks, extremely bewildered. She has to fight everything in her not to sit up and aggravate her ribs.</p><p>“It was my idea,” Agatha states simply. Rio stares blankly at her host. “Spring break my senior year of college, my friends and I were on a road trip but the car broke down in Westview, the entire engine had to be replaced. We were broke and could only repay through manual labor.”</p><p>Rio squints, her mind navigating the haze of her memories. She vaguely remembers three stragglers, the town had called them, passing through the town. Spring break would've brought them to March of whatever year Agatha was in college but back then it was all a blur. </p><p>“Jen crashed with Dottie, Wanda was with the mechanic and I was with Lilia. We were drunk one night and it just… came to us.”</p><p>“What the fuck,” Rio murmurs. Her head is already hazy from the medicine but it just exploded at this new information. “Where the fuck was I then?”</p><p>“That was the year you were hiking the Catskills dear,” Lilia answers plainly. Rio gulps harshly at the reminder; she was hiking solo for a few weeks on a forced vacation from Lilia after she hadn't taken a day off in a few years. When Rio returned, she received news that her parents died and she couldn't find it in herself to leave again.</p><p>The anger is immediate, she can feel it burning in her chest, waiting to be released. “This entire time, I’ve been haunting these innocent hikers, because a <em>drunken con</em>?!” </p><p>The coughing comes instantly. Her eyes grew wide as her body protested the sharp inhale of her lungs. Her vision immediately goes white with each persistent interruption to her lungs and ribcage.</p><p>Worry flashes across Agatha’s face as she rushes to Rio’s side, leaving her phone at the end of the bed. Her body’s convulsing and she can see the defined abs beneath the bruised skin, but she’s even more concerned when she sees Rio gasp for each breath.</p><p>Agatha immediately regrets sharing the origin story, seeing the shock and immediate pain she caused afterwards. She runs into the bathroom and fills a glass of water and places it on the nightstand. </p><p>Finally, the coughing fades away but the pain lingers, leaving Rio’s throat raw and chest still burning. Silently she grabs the glass and slowly gulps down some water, but it goes down the wrong pipe, sending Rio into another small coughing fit.</p><p>Agatha watches her, unsure of what to say. She never expected that con to turn into what it is today, nor did she expect it to affect Rio the way it has. Her mind races, trying to find ways to ease the pain she caused, but it comes up blank.</p><p>“Rio, breathe…” Her voice is soft, almost a whisper, her hand rubbing against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio’s initial reaction is to jerk it away, but she forgets her arm is in a sling and pain shoots through her shoulder. Agatha snaps her hand away from hers, as if she touched hot metal herself. </p><p>“I’m sorry, I shouldn't have phrased it like that. It was a stupid idea over too much wine. I didn't think it would turn into this.”</p><p>Rio exhales shakily, her breaths still shallow, each sending a shockwave through her chest. </p><p>“Well it did,” she says sharply.</p><p>Agatha should not find her deep, raspy voice as attractive as she does, no. But she does.</p><p>“Rio? Listen to me, don't blame Agatha. I’m the one who followed through with it,” Lilia urges through the phone. </p><p>“You let me keep doing it,” Rio says, voice crackling with the ache in her throat and pain from her ribs.</p><p>“Yes, I know-”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lilia sighs heavily. “You weren’t the same after the Catskills. You barely left the cabin, I had to send Alice down The Road a few times to make sure you were still alive. I thought it’d give you something to look forward to.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightens at Lilia’s words  and she feels a flicker of guilt beneath the anger. “You knew what happened,” she murmurs, her voice a mixture of frustration and hurt. “You should've told me.”</p><p>Lilia’s silent for a long beat. When she speaks again, her voice is quiet with laces of regret. “I thought you needed it. And I missed you. It’s like you were slipping away, and I didn't know how to pull you back.”</p><p>“I didn't want to be pulled back. I just wanted to be left alone.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softens as she watches Rio struggle with the weight of the conversation. </p><p>Lilia sighs again. “I know, but it doesn't always work that way. Not when you were drowning in yourself.”</p><p>Rio’s good hand curls into a fist beneath the sheets. “I don't need saving. I didn't then and I don't now.”</p><p>“I never meant to make you feel that way. I just wanted to help you find your way back to yourself.”</p><p>The silence is longer, more uncomfortable. Agatha shifts slowly, unsure of what to do with herself. </p><p>“What do we tell the kid?” Rio eventually asks. Her jaw is still tight and Agatha knows she hasn't let it go just yet, but this was brought up for a reason and she needs a distraction.</p><p>“The truth,” Agatha offers.</p><p>Rio scoffs loudly. “What? That she’s a myth made up by his drunk mother thirty years ago-”</p><p>“Twenty-seven-”</p><p>“- and that she was just a con to scare hikers?”</p><p>“She’s more than that, Rio,” Lilia reminds her. “I know you live off the grid but the public doesn't see her that way. She became a legend in the woods, she gave the trees life and gave hikers a reason to come to Westview.”</p><p>Agatha nods, quietly echoing Lilia’s words. “Lady Death saved the park from closing, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw somehow tightens even more. “She’s not real.”</p><p>“Yes she is Rio,” Lilia says gently. “She’s a part of you, no one can take that away from you.”</p><p>Rio looks away, eyes fixed on the crème colored wall, lost in the quiet hum of the penthouse. The pain in her ribs pulses with her breath, but something else is gnawing at her now, something deep and unspoken.</p><p>“Look, I hate to cut this short, but I need to go,” Lilia says. “Someone just tried to sneak past the Do Not Enter sign we put up on The Road.”</p><p>“Go, I’ll call you later,” Rio dismisses, head throbbing trying to wrap her mind around the truth.</p><p>“Rest Rio, and heal. The forest will be patiently awaiting your return.”</p><p>The line disconnects and silences the room once again. Exhaustion overtakes Rio’s entire body.</p><p>“I’m tired,” she eventually says when she feels Agatha’s presence still in the room. </p><p>“Okay, I’ll just be outside. If you need anything let me know,” Agatha says. She lingers for another moment, watching as Rio’s eyes drift close. </p><p>Agatha grabs a mattress pad, a pillow and a few blankets, and makes camp right outside her door, just in case.</p><p>Meanwhile, exhaustion pulls at Rio’s body, but her mind persists.</p><p>Lady Death.</p><p>A shadow in the woods. A story passed around fires and quieted at sunrise. And now the truth was out, Agatha made the whole thing up. A drunken idea turned into a myth. Lilia kept the secret, the whole town played along. But the actions? The omens, the haunting, leaving flowers in her wake, that was all Rio’s doing. </p><p>
<em>No one can take her away from you.</em>
</p><p>But it doesn't feel like hers anymore.</p><p>Rio presses the heel of her hand to her forehead, as if that would settle her mind. The myth she’d quietly become was never hers to begin with.</p><p>She doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. Maybe both.</p><p>Agatha’s words echo in her mind. <em>You saved the park from closing.</em> Sleep finally overtakes Rio’s body as she tries to decipher just what Agatha meant by that.</p>

<p>
<span>Moonlight passes through the fog, casting a pale glow across the jagged rocks. Rio lies crumpled on the gravel, her body twisted in a way that doesn't feel human. The air is too still. The forest hums, not with life, but with something watching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tries to move, but she can't; her limbs are too heavy. A metallic taste coats her tongue. The crunch of footsteps nearby makes her head twitch. Two silhouettes emerge from the shadows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her parents look as they did the last time they saw her - weathered, warm, a quiet strength, a unified team - but something's off. They don’t move as the living do. Rio squints and can see the slight opaqueness of their features.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mamí? Papí?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They smile softly, then instantly their faces are gone. Replaced with the mask she wears as Lady Death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You stayed too long,” her father’s voice echoes loudly throughout the shadows in the pine. In the distance, she can hear crows fleeing the trees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look at you now, you can't even get up,” her mother taunts. Rio’s eyes bulge, desperation clawing in her bones to escape, but still she’s rooted in the bedrock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The trees illuminate in fire, and all Rio’s senses are blurred. The mask of Lady Death vanishes away and then she sees her parents dangling from the ridge, desperately holding on for their lives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instantly they both are pulled down beside her, bodies falling limp at the contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The scream is bloodcurdling; raw, primal, straight from her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She bolts upright, or tries to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pain shoots like wildfire through her ribs, sharp enough to steal the air from her lungs. Firm hands keep her planted to the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, relax. You're safe, it’s just a dream,” Agatha says gently, worry etched into her sharp eyebrows, concern flooding her ocean blue eyes. They look tired, her hair is wild, like she came straight from her own sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s vision is blurred through tears, panic and sweat. Her chest heaves, her skin is burning. It takes her a moment to realize Agatha’s hands are still on her shoulders, grounding her, pulling her back to reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard screaming,” she continued, voice just above a whisper as if speaking any louder would shatter Rio’s resolve. “You were- god you were thrashing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stares up at the ceiling, blinking away the tears. The room is dimmed, the flicker of sunrise creeping through the shades. Her body is trembling, sheets damp with sweat, cooling blanket soaked through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brows furrow. She presses the back of her hand to Rio’s clammy forehead. “You're burning up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She disappears from the room and returns with a thermometer and a cloth. She holds out the device, waiting for Rio to open her mouth, but she doesn't.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to go back to the hospital?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grunts in protest but turns her head, still refusing the thermometer. “I said I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, you're burning up and you're probably one coughing fit away from puncturing a lung again. Take the damn temp.” Her voice isn't angry, just firm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembers what Nicky had told her the other day - what she says goes - and for a moment, she can sympathize with his disdain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Begrudgingly, Rio snatches the device from her hand and places it in her mouth, while Agatha disappears to the bathroom and rinses the cloth with cool water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she comes back, she wipes the hair from Rio’s forehead gently, eyes catching the thermometer as it beeps.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>102.7</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Happy now?” Rio mutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Agatha presses the cloth to her forehead, lingering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t say it, but something about the way Rio resisted, the defiance in her voice, reminds her of Nicky. Agatha loves him with everything in her, he’s her light, but damn is he stubborn. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They both freeze as they hear Nicky’s voice echo from the kitchen. Rio weakly shakes her head and instantly Agatha understands. “I’ll be back in a bit,” she whispers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She walks quietly to the kitchen, where her son is hunched over a bowl of cereal. Her twists with anxious knots. She hadn’t spoken to Nicky since their disagreement, and now Rio, down the hall, fevered and shaken, has her thoughts scattered. She shouldn’t care this deeply for her yet. It’s been such a short time. But she does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’s she doing?” Nicky asks when he notices she isn’t dressed for work or buried in her laptop. She looks ragged, like she didn’t sleep much the previous night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She had a rough night, and she has a fever. I wouldn't go back there right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, she needs to rest. Your film can wait.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a flicker of guilt as the words leave her mouth. A selfish part of her wants to keep Rio to herself, to protect her, watch over her uninterrupted. To fix the small rift between them before Nicky’s questions return. She loves her kid, she really does, but sometimes he can be a bit much. “Go out, I’ll keep an eye on her. Enjoy the last bit of summer before school starts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He studies her, then nods. “Okay.” He retreats to his room briefly and returns with a backpack slung over his shoulder. “I’m off to see Billy, love you Mama”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you too baby.” The hug lingers, air of apologies and forgiveness with each second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Nicky leaves, she grabs her laptop, a mug of fresh coffee, a bottle of Gatorade and retreats back to Rio’s room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cracks the door softly, trying not to startle Rio but when she steps in, she sees her fast asleep in the bed. Gently, she replaces the damp cloth on her forehead and she makes her way over to a nearby chair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She opens her laptops and reviews current business proposals, but her mind can't focus on work. Instead it’s fixated on the park ranger currently asleep a few feet away from her, on the steady rise and fall of her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The past few weeks finally catches up to her; anxiety when Lilia called out of the blue to let her know Nicky was on his way to the hospital, relief when she was told he wasn't the one injured. Worry for his savior, dread when Dottie let her know she couldn't do anything more for Rio. Determination to bring Rio to Manhattan. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hadn't even met the woman but she couldn't let her die without knowing how grateful she was for saving her son.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually Rio was airlifted to New York Presbyterian and Agatha nearly vomited at the sight of her body; She was battered and bruised all over, so fragile, as if one wrong movement could shatter her into a million pieces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she was finally given the green light to be moved somewhere more private, Agatha felt like she could breathe again. Nicky was home and Rio was given access to the best doctors, technology and medicine on the market. She personally rode in the ambulance over to Jen’s practice. Jen, who’d been with Agatha through thick and thin, had never seen her more rattled and gave the patient nothing but the best comfort and care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Nicky traded off sitting with Rio, not wanting her to be alone after Lilia told her that she didn't have family nearby, and the park was already short staffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart skipped a beat when Nicky told her that Rio woke up; she dropped everything at the office, unfinished business proposals, hundreds of emails waiting for her signature, and sat with Rio until her eyes were less foggy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now she’s in her home. In her care. She should feel relieved, but she doesn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha never realized that her drunk idea to help the park would actually grow into fruition. Honestly, she didn't think Lilia had even remembered the idea, there was so much wine that night. All she wanted to do was somehow repay the town for giving her a memorable spring break.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, Jen, and Wanda were all roommates freshman year of college. Some administration employees had messed up when scheduling room assignments and the trio lived in a cramped double room. It was a surprise they didn't burn down the entire dorm. Agatha and Wanda were acting students, determined to become the next Hollywood stars, while Jen was on the pre-med track. None of them came from warmth or easy homes, but they found sisters they never had in each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Flash forward to senior year, their final spring break before adulthood brought them their separate ways. That week changed everything for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forgot whose idea it was originally for a road trip, but the next thing they knew, they were booking a rental and headed upstate. Of course, no one knew the car would break down in the smallest town they’d ever known that doesn't even show up on most maps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Westview was no more than 2,000 residents total, but it was perfect; a little slice of quiet, mundane before Fate’s unpredictable mannerisms etched her way through their lives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s week with Dottie taught her just exactly what kind of doctor she didn't want to become; although she wasn't immune to a little drama and speculation, she’s pretty sure Dottie broke every HIPPA law in existence. She eventually finished medical school and opened her own private practice, now one of the most requested and highly accredited doctors in the city.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda met Vision - Agatha’s still not sure if that’s his real name, but it’s too late now to ask - the introverted yet charming town mechanic, who she’d go on to marry five years later. He eventually moved out of Westview to the city with Wanda, and they started a family together in the city around the same time Agatha had Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was taken under by Lilia at the park. She was the least adapted to the wilderness of the three of them, but that only made Lilia want her more. They spent the week wandering the paths, getting lost among the trees and Lilia became the mother-figure Agatha never had growing up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Though her career brought her back to the land of the modern, Westview National Park had nestled its way into Agatha’s heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia had been her long-distance rock through everything: her first show, her first movie, her first award, her struggle with the spotlight and fame, her unplanned pregnancy, Nicky's illness, her transition out of the public eye, her first company. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The winter after Agatha graduated, Lilia called to tell her that her idea worked, and more people were coming to the park. Of course Agatha wondered who the woman behind the mask was, but Lilia only ever referred to Lady Death as ‘the mountain keeper.’ She didn't know Lady Death was Nicky’s savior until she arrived at the hospital and Lilia told her everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now it feels different, heavier. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn't created a legend, only a lie that lured her son to danger and left a woman shattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales slowly, fingers curled against the cool ceramic mug of her too bitter coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted to give Westview something magical, something worth saving. But it came with a price; nearly losing her son due to a lie and a woman who took the weight of the town on her shoulders, and called it duty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio never asked for Lady Death, and Nicky never should’ve chased it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But now, they're both tangled in the myth, and she doesn't know how to free them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wakes slowly through her haze. Her skin is still burning, but the weight of sleep has loosened its grip just enough to let her surface. Her breath feels heavy, like breathing through cotton, and every movement sends an ache down her ribs like dull lightning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The soft clicking of laptop keys draws her attention to the corner, where Agatha sits comfortably with a pair of reading glasses, an oversized cardigan and yoga pants. Rio can see the exhaustion written all over her face and grimaces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What time is it?” Rio asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A little after nine,” Agatha says, without looking up from her computer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shouldn’t you be at work?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perks of being the boss, I can do this from anywhere,” she says, closing her laptop. Agatha sets it aside and rises from the chair, pressing her forehead against Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You still have a fever. You need to stay hydrated.” She grabs the bottle of Gatorade and uncaps it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, Rio shifts upright with a wince, her muscles protesting. Agatha’s there in an instant, slipping a hand behind her back to steady her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Rio mutters, though her voice is thin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not,” Agatha insists, holding the bottle to her lips. “Sip.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio obeys, only because it’s easier than arguing. The cool liquid soothes her throat instantly and she hates how good it feels.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches her with a mix of relief and something else, something deeper. A fear that hadn’t quite faded since the moment she saw Rio on that stretcher.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you mean when you said Lady Death saved the park?” Rio asks suddenly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitates, unsure if Rio could handle the news. She decides instantly, no more lies. “When I was in Westview for the first time, Lilia told me that the mayor was considering budget cuts for the park. It would’ve broken her heart, and people would’ve lost their jobs but he didn't care if it saved him some money for god knows what else he had planned.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She chuckles as she recalls the conversation she had with Lilia that night. “I’m pretty sure all I said was ‘if they want to kill the park, we’d need a ghost story big enough to chase them out of it.’ I was just being dramatic, venting but Lilia got this look in her eye…” Agatha shakes her head, half smiling. “Next thing I know hikers are whispering about a woman in black leaving little warnings in the trees. At first it worked- people were spooked but you couldn't help but leave something behind. The flowers, the tokens… Something gentle. And somehow, they kept coming back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio isn't an idiot, she knows the town is small and money is tight all around, but she’s also seen Agatha’s heart over the past few days. Whatever happened back then, she understands now that it came from the right place. Agatha had just been thinking of the park, same as she was. Just in a different way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t a stupid idea,” Rio says after a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brows draw in confusion. “What wasn’t?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Death,” she says with a light chuckle. “I probably would've been out of a job by then if Davis went through with the cuts. It’s actually kind of fun roaming the woods at night. I did it anyway, but getting to scare hikers was always amusing to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a breath she doesn't realize she was holding, like something’s healed in her she didn’t know was fractured. She sits back on the bed, careful not to disturb Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never meant for it to be dangerous. It was supposed to be harmless, a little magic for the town,” she says, her voice low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiles, faint but real. “It was always a little dangerous, some hikers got real creative with ways to entrap me. I had to learn how to bypass several bear traps in the dark, but it made the challenge more enthralling. And it was magic, you turned Westview into one of the best parks to visit on this side of the Mississippi.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You almost died because of it,” Agatha urges, the words cracking on the way out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers, trembling but determined, brush lightly against Agatha’s hand near the blanket. “It’s not your fault.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha covers Rio’s hand with her own, grounding them both. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know you didn't need to do all of this,” Rio says again after a few lingering moments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes roll slightly, but a hint of a smile ghosts her face. “This fever is making you delirious. Yes I did, I needed to thank the person who saved my son.” Her expression becomes serious, haunted as the fresh memory of Rio’s body in the hospital plays in her mind. “You didn't see it, but you- it was a bad fall. Jen said that if the rock wasn't there, you would’ve died on impact. I know you said you didn't need saving but you deserve a fighting chance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes shift away, lingering on their intertwined hands. Her eyes steele and her jaw tightens. When she speaks again, her voice is just above a whisper. “I didn't mean it like that; I wasn't trying to die. I- I didn't have many friends growing up, and you’ve seen Westview, everyone is in everyone’s business. The park is quiet, I can be myself there, no questions asked. The Catskills were my first vacation in a long time, and when I came back, Lilia told me that my parents had died. Hiking accident in Australia I think. She was right too. If I hadn’t become Lady Death, I would’ve just withered away in my cabin. I couldn’t stand to see people’s pity or sympathy, I didn’t want it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t say anything right away, she lets Rio’s words simmer in the air between them, heavy and honest. Her thumb moves absentmindedly against the back of Rio’s hand, tracing small grounding circles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha says softly. “No one should have to carry that kind of grief alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat bobs as she swallows, eyes still fixed on their hands. “I’ve just been on my own for a while, I guess I just got used to it,” she finishes, voice fraying at the edges. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans in slightly, not too far, but close enough to that Rio can feel the warmth of her presence. Her voice softens, threaded with something more vulnerable. “That doesn’t mean you have to stay that way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks up at her then, really looks, her own eyes are glassy, lips parted like she’s about to argue, but the words get stuck in her throat. Her gaze flickers to Agatha’s mouth for a second too long, then back up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know how not to,” she admits, voice raw and quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand tightens slightly over hers, thumb brushing slow circles again. “You don’t have to figure it out alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence that follows isn’t uncomfortable - it settles over them like a shared blanket, warm and fragile. Rio doesn't pull away, and Agatha doesn’t press further. They just stay there, suspended in a moment that feels like the beginning of something they’re both too cautious to name just yet. </span>

<p>
<span>A few hours later, Agatha sits in her home office. The wall is shared with Rio’s next door but after enough quiet reassurances that she was okay, Agatha finally let herself slip away for a few hours to actually get some work done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s in the middle of reading over a contract about a new type of imaging device when her phone rings, with Wanda’s contact name on the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello?” Agatha says, eyes still scanning the document.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why is Billy going on about him and Nicky going to Westview to film a movie in the middle of the woods?” Wanda asks without preamble. Her voice is soft, curious, but Agatha can hear the edge beneath it, the unmistakable worry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighs, closing her laptop, picking the phone up to her ear. “Nice to hear from you too, by the way. It’s a long story, and really things have only started to calm down here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have time, we’ve wrapped shooting for the day,” Wanda says, coaxing now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans back in her chair. “A few weeks ago, Nicky went up to Westview on his own, he was scouting for his capstone. Next thing I knew, Lilia called me saying he’s in the hospital, but he wasn’t the one injured, one of the rangers was. She nearly died. And Dottie… well, you know Dottie, she couldn’t do much more for her after stabilizing and even then it was risky. I had her transferred here and she’s staying with me while she recovers,” Agatha explains.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus christ,” Wanda breathes. “Well I’m glad Nicky’s okay and the ranger pulled through. That still doesn’t explain why Nicky and Billy are going </span>
<em>
<span>back</span>
</em>
<span> to the park.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitates briefly. “Has Vision ever mentioned Lady Death to you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh man,” Wanda mutters. She’d always known Agatha had a hand in saving the park, but the details had been vague. Vision only shared the truth when he pieced it together himself, long after the myth had taken root. “Wait a sec- Rio’s staying with you?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rubs at her temples, though confusion festers. “How do you know who Rio is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda hums, almost smug. “Vision figured it out years ago. One of his clients came in with a rare flower on their dashboard - he said it only grows way off-trail in the northwest side of the park. After that, it didn’t take long for him to connect the dots. But you know him, he’s not one to gossip, especially about someone he respects, but he told me because I’m his wife, duh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a soft, surprised laugh. “Of course. The mechanic solves a ghost story with botany and pickup trucks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He always loved puzzles,” Wanda says warmly. “But seriously, Rio? At your penthouse?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes. She’s still recovering, so try not to send a fruit basket with a GPS tracker in it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No promises.” Wanda’s voice softens. “How’s she doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So so,” Agatha says after a pause. “She’s pretty banged up and is running a fever. She won’t admit she needs help, but… I don’t know, she’s letting me in a little.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a brief silence, then Wanda’s voice lifts just a little. “You like her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs through her nose. “Wanda-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>like </span>
</em>
<span>her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans back in her chair and stares at the wall that separates her office from Rio’s room. “She’s… not what I expected. She didn’t even know who I was when she woke up, I still don’t think she does now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not denial,” Wanda says. Agatha can see her grin through the phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lets the quiet settle before she says, softly, “she’s been through more than she lets on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s lucky to have you,” Wanda says earnestly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales. “I think that’s the last thing on her mind right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a pause on the line, just long enough to breathe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well that </span>
<em>
<span>does</span>
</em>
<span> explain why Billy’s been texting me cryptic nature photos and asking if I know how to purify river water,” Wanda says, her tone laced with affection and confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs a tired laugh. “Sounds about right, but I need to talk to Nicky about the plot. He wanted to uncover her but little does he know Lady Death is currently laying in my guest bedroom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda lets out a scandalized little gasp. “Agatha! You didn’t tell him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t have the heart, and I didn’t even know until I got to the hospital!” she admits, rubbing at her forehead. She makes a mental note to check in with Jen for an updated skin routine. “He’s been chasing this myth like it’s his Holy Grail. And now she’s here, alive, barely and definitely not in the mood to be the climax of his capstone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, he’s going to lose it,” Wanda says, clearly entertained. “That boy’s got the dramatic flair of a telenovela lead. You should film that instead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just might, for documentation,” Agatha says dryly. “The look on his face will be priceless.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does Rio know he was looking for her?” Wanda asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pauses. “I don’t think so, or if she does, she hasn’t brought it up. I had to kick him out earlier to stop him from asking more questions, she needs rest not an interrogation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s going to flip if she finds he’s poking around trying to unmask her. Especially if he starts waving a camera around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He isn’t the first, she said something about bear traps in the past,” Agatha murmurs. “That’s why I need to get ahead of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure you’re not just trying to protect her?” Wanda asks gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t answer right away. “I don’t want him turning her grief into a plot twist. She deserves better than that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda hums. “Spoken like someone who’s catching feelings.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll feed Billy to a bear trap.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughs softly, the sound light and teasing. “Sure, you will. A bear trap can at least get what it wants.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shakes her head, though she can feel the heat rising on her cheeks. “Wanda, stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice softens, but the playful edge is still there. “I’m just saying Agatha, you never let people into your home. Regardless of Rio saving Nicky's life, I’m assuming you’ve paid for everything, letting her stay with you is more than generous. You like her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales a heavy breath, leaning forward in her chair, flickering back to the shared wall. “I’m just trying to make sure Nicky doesn’t turn this into some sort of spectacle. Rio’s been through enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Wanda says, her tone more understanding. “But you've been through enough too. And if you’re being honest with yourself, you’re not just protecting her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to make things harder for her, she’s already holding so much inside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s voice softens even further, full of warmth. “You’re allowed to care about someone, Agatha. Your mother was wrong, it’s not wrong to want a woman. It’s not a weakness, it’s human. God if that woman wasn’t already six feet under I’d kill her myself if I had to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha says with an amused chuckle. “I just don’t know if she’s ready for any of that yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you’ve got plenty of time. But you're not fooling anyone, least of all me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, though a smile tugs at her lips. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know. But seriously, keep an eye on Nicky and Billy, they’re going to stir up more trouble than they realize.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will, and thanks for listening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Always,” Wanda says warmly. “And if Rio’s still out of commission, I can try and send you some decent Dutch weed. You know, purely medicinal in case Nicky’s giving you a headache.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I’ll stick to raiding whatever Jen has in her secret stash,” Agatha jokes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you dare relapse, or get her fired,” Wanda chastises. “Wait- does Jen know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She treated Rio after the transfer, but the truth? No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be sure to bring back weed for her as well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good, I’ll talk to you soon, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, take care of yourself. And call me if Rio smiles at you,” Wanda says before hanging up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lowers the phone and exhales slowly, rubbing her face with her hands. She stares at the wall for a moment, lost in thought. There’s so much going on, so many emotions she’s still grappling with. But for now, she’s got a movie to stop from being made. And somehow, she’s okay with that. For Rio, she’ll handle anything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s later in the day when Rio decides she needs a change of scenery. Her fever still hasn’t broken yet, but she can only stare at the same four walls for so long, plus the silence was suffocating; she’d rather be in company for once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha helps her over to the couch, telling her not to move and giving her more Gatorade and an oversized cardigan to stay warm. Rio shyly admits that she doesn’t know how to work the flatscreen t.v. and Agatha sets up Brooklyn 99 and she sits there watching. She’s just finished the cold open where the precinct guesses why Amy’s late for work when Nicky bursts through the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama! You’ll never guess-” He stops dead in his tracks when he sees Rio on the couch, just startled at the sudden noise in the house. Agatha’s over by the stovetop clutching her heart and Rio gives a dry chuckle at the sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.. uh, hi,” he says, voice pitching up slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Rio says, hoarse and unsure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha steps in from the kitchen, drying her hands on a dish towel. “Nice of you to knock.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did! Kinda!” Nicky says defensively, still staring between the two of them. “Wait, are you feeling better?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sort of kid,” Rio shrugs. She doesn’t look any better, a thin layer of sweat still coating her forehead and voice still hoarse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s an awkward beat, Nicky fidgets and Agatha sighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sit down,” she tells him. “We need to talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That gets his attention. “What happened? Is this about the movie?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What movie?” Rio asks, brow furrowing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh! I’m making a film on Westview Park for my senior year capstone,” he explains eagerly. “I know I don’t need to start until next year but I want to do it right. The scripts have been in the works for a few months and mama, I finally got Billy to take a break from Broadway to join this, and we were going to try and uncover Lady Death!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio visibly gulps, horror creeping up her neck. “Is that why you were in Westview the other week? To try and find her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No- well yes,” she says, shifting in his seat. “I was scouting locations and if I happened to catch a glimpse of her, then that would’ve been a plus.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glances towards Rio, who gives her a weak nod.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You already found her,” Agatha says gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Surprise kid,” she says cheekily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky lets out a laugh, but it’s weak. “That’s- no. That can’t be right. Lady Death’s a ghost story! She’s- she’s supposed to haunt people, right? Leave flowers or whatever. That’s not-” he gestures to Rio, floundering. “You’re not haunting people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kind of hard to haunt when I can’t exactly breathe properly,” Rio mutters under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s face falls a little. “Right. Sorry. That was- insensitive of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she says, serious now. “You’re not wrong. Lady Death was never supposed to be someone like me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He hesitates, watching her carefully. “Then who was she supposed to be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks down at her good hand. “Someone who shows up, leaves her mark, then disappears before the world can touch her. That’s all they made her out to be right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pretty much,” Nicky admits, rubbing the back of his neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha steps in gently. “And that story kept the park alive, kept people curious. It gave Rio a place to disappear into when the world got too loud.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s brows knit. “Wait, you knew?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales, rubbing her temples. “Technically, I created it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wince’s at his outburst, but jumps in quickly. “I wasn’t trying to scare anyone. The flowers, they weren’t warnings. They were just what I had. A way to say ‘I was here.’ A way to remember people who made it out when I couldn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nods slowly, piecing it together. “You were grieving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio meets his eyes. “Still am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a quiet moment that hangs between them for a moment, warm, and a little raw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Nicky, voice calm again, “you’re kind of a badass, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs a laugh, “I haven’t showered in god knows how long, I look like the wilderness’s demon spawn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” he grins. “Badass.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t use her,” Agatha cuts in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky freezes, voice dropping. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crosses her arms. “Your film. You can’t turn her into some exposé.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t going to-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t know it was her,” she says. “But you do now. So I need you to understand this: this story doesn’t belong to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts on the couch, uncomfortable at the sternness in Agatha’s voice. “It’s fine-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s not,” Agatha says, eyes still on Nicky. “You said you wanted to uncover Lady Death like she was a buried secret. But she’s not. She’s a person. She’s sitting in our living room because you were reckless and didn’t look at the signage. She doesn’t owe the world a damn thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s face twists, like he’s trying to hold back four different reactions. “So what, I just pretend she doesn’t exist? Scrap everything and lie?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You wouldn’t be lying,” Agatha says, quieter now. “You’d be protecting someone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But this is </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> project,” he says, almost pleading. “It matters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t budge, her voice firm. “So does she.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart warms at her protection, more than she’s used, more than she’s known in a long time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky opens his mouth, then closes it again. He runs a hand through his hair, pacing a little. “You know how hard I’ve worked on this? I thought I was onto something big!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>were</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha insists. “But not everything big needs to be blown open. Some things are better left… sacred.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches him, unsure. “It’s not like I was trying to be sacred. I just didn’t want to be </span>
<em>
<span>seen</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky turns to her, eyes wide. “But that’s what makes it good, Rio. That’s why people care. She shows up, leaves something behind, and disappears. It’s cinematic. You lived what most people could only write about.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightens. “You’re not thinking this through. Say she says yes, and then what? News reporters show up on her doorstep, asking the same questions over and over again and she’ll have to relive her grief every damn day, except this time it’s plastered all over the tabloids. Trust me Nicky I know what that’s like and I </span>
<em>
<span>chose</span>
</em>
<span> that life for myself. Throwing that onto someone else isn’t a blessing, it’s a fucking burden.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s face hardens, and without another word, he turns toward the door, his hand reaching for the handle. “I need some air,” he mutters, trying to pull away from the conversation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before he can make his exit, Agatha steps in front of him, blocking his exit. Her posture is rigid, her eyes fixed on him with a piercing intensity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she says, her voice low but commanding. “You’re not running from this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s frustration flares, and he doesn’t hold back. He glares at her, his voice sharp and dripping with resentment. “I’m not running away. I’m just trying to get some space from your bullshit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stands her ground, her eyes unwavering. “You don’t get to walk away from this. Not without thinking of the consequences of the person who fucking saved your life. It’s bigger than your frustration, Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His chest tightens, his anger boiling over. With a cold glare, he steps closer to her, the words tumbling out before he can stop them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a fucking coward. You ran from your life the moment you got pregnant, hiding behind this ‘perfect mother’ image. How convenient, you stopped being a drugged-out mess and put on the ‘good mom’ act just to save face. All you cared about was fixing your image, not actually dealing with your shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face goes pale, like he’s slapped her. But she doesn’t back down. Her voice, when it comes, is low and controlled, almost too calm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had no choice. You needed a heart- a </span>
<em>
<span>heart</span>
</em>
<span>, Nicky. I did whatever I had to do to keep you alive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky scoffs, eyes flashing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And now what? I’m supposed to be grateful every time you pull that card? You think I owe you silence, obedience, a carefully curated life just because you kept me breathing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. I don’t want your obedience. I want you to grow the hell up! I sacrificed everything to make sure you had a future. One where you didn’t have to carry the weight I did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bullshit! You didn’t sacrifice everything. You rebranded. You found a new stage, a cleaner one and slapped a lab coat over the hot mess you already were. You made saving me your redemption arc.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips part, wounded, but she holds firm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never used you. I fought for you. You think I cared about the cameras? I would’ve burned the world down if it meant you’d live.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah and then you rebuilt it around me like a glass box. Every part of my life’s been about keeping up your image - your miracle cure, your second chance. I’m not your fresh start. I’m not your clean slate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never asked you to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then stop acting like my choices are yours to rewrite. You want control over your legacy so bad? Fine. But don’t pretend this was all for me when it’s always been about you trying to prove you’re not the girl who got knocked up in rehab.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flinches. That one lands hard. Her shoulders tense like she’s been physically struck, but she still doesn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think I’m ashamed of you?” She asks, quieter but still firm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you’re ashamed of who you were, and I’m just the thing you used to erase her,” he says bitterly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did what I </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> to do-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you did what made you look better. What gave you something to point at when the headlines stopped caring. ‘Look at me now, I’m not the girl who passed out in a bathroom stall - I’m a mother, a CEO, a miracle worker who saved her sick kid, and now I’m selling this bullshit to other hospitals so they can upsell their own patients whose lives are already shit.’ You used my condition to buy back your soul.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes go wide, brimming now - not with tears, but with fury and heartbreak tangles so tightly she’s barely keeping it together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saved your life Nicky. You wouldn’t have lived past six if I hadn’t walked away from everything and clawed something out of nothing-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I didn’t ask for any of it! I didn’t ask to be your goddamn lifeline. I didn’t ask to be born to a woman who partied through her twenties and then decided to play God!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were never a mistake!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe not. But I was definitely a wake-up call, wasn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a long, brutal silence. That kind that makes the walls feel thinner, the air heavier. Agatha’s breathing is hard now, jaw clenched, hands balled into a fist by her sides like she doesn’t know whether to hit something or collapse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then - softly, venomously. “All this… perfect life, perfect mother, perfect company. It’s all bullshit. You’re just a mess who got lucky. And I’m tired of pretending I owe you for that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice is loud, strained, enough to make both of them freeze. The tension crackles in the silence that follows - Agatha breathing heavily, Nicky still radiating anger, but they both glance toward the couch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s still curled under the cardigan, pale, feverish, but her eyes are locked on them - sharper than either expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what the fuck happened before I got here, it’s not my place. But this? This isn’t just about me anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They wait a beat to see if she’s done. She isn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks towards Nicky first. “You want to tell my story because you think it matters. I get that. But using it to punish someone else - to punish your own mother - doesn’t make you a good person. It makes you cruel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s jaw tightens. “I’m not-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are. Right now, you are,” she says, voice firm but calm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She then turns to Agatha next, and for a second her gaze harder to hold. “And you don’t get to make decisions for me because you're scared I’ll end up hurt. Newsflash I already have been. But I’m still here. I get to choose what I carry, and what I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat works as she tries to swallow whatever she’s about to say next.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales, it’s ragged, full of effort. “You both love hard, but you fight to kill. All you’re doing right now, is leaving scars on each other and it’s only a matter of time before you both bleed out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leans back again, suddenly looking smaller, but there’s no mistaking the power of what she just said. The room goes still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not your battleground,” she says after a beat. The silence that follows is thick, crackling with everything unsaid. Agatha’s lips press together, like she’s trying to hold something back - fury, regret, panic - but before she can say a word, Rio lets out a soft, guttural cough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turns her head, trying to stifle it in her sleeve. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A bright smear of red spreads across the cuff of her cardigan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, no no no-” Agatha’s eyes go wide, her voice breaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tries to speak, but instead doubles over, another harsh cough wracking her chest. More blood spatters onto the floor, some even on Agatha’s top. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Holy shit-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky! Get the car. Now. GO.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He rushes frantically out of the penthouse, grabbing the nearest set of keys and immediately makes a beeline for the garage. Agatha pulls Rio into her arms, cradling her like something fragile and irreplaceable. Rio’s eyes flutter weakly, unfocused, her breathrasping like it’s caught in her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hang on baby, I’ve got you,” Agatha whispers. “Please, just a few more minutes, I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Within two minutes, Nicky pulls up to the side of the building, the door already open for Agatha in the back. He hesitates when he sees the blood on the edge of Rio’s mouth, now all over Agatha’s jeans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky! Drive!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s a five minute drive to the nearest hospital. Five minutes too long, </span>
</p><p>
<span>The chaos of the emergency room is a perfect metaphor for Agatha’s state of being. Nicky pulls up hastily to the entrance, swinging the door open for Agatha to rush a fully unconscious Rio into the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Help! I need help!” Agatha screams into the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nurses immediately rush over to her, stretcher in tow, bringing her into a room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio Vidal. Dislocated shoulder, fractured ribs, had a fever, coughing up blood,” she rattles off to the nearest nurse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She doesn't have a pulse,” one of them says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A nurse backs Agatha up, another one charging the paddle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Clear!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The limp body convulses, but no heartbeat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Clear!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! Rio, don't do this to me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ma’am, you need to stay back,” a nurse urges.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Jen says from behind, her eyes bulging at the scene.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Charging to 300, clear!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her body convulses again, still nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen immediately enters the room, holding Agatha back from another charge. “Agatha, you need to give them space.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The defibrillator whines, charging again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Charging to 360, clear!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s body jerks violently on the table once more, the thump echoing louder than anything else in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still. No beeping. No heartbeat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, no- come on, please-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha struggles against Jen’s grip, her voice fraying at the edges. Her nails dig into Jen’s arms but Jen doesn't flinch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, look at me,” she urges. “Look at me, there’s nothing you can do. Let them work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No pulse, starting compressions,” a nurse says urgently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s knees buckle and Jen drags her away from the door just as another nurse closes the curtain between them and the trauma bay. The sound of rapid compressions and frantic commands still leaking through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was fine, she was fine,” Agatha begins sobbing into Jen’s shoulder. “We were at home, she said she was fine, she was moving, she was still there!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Jen coaxes, rubbing her hand against Agatha’s trembling form.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama?” Nicky says, rushing in when he sees his mother in Jen’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky! Stay back!” Jen yells, a nurse stepping in to hold him at bay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sir, you need to wait in the designated area.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Nicky’s eyes are locked on Agatha, body shaking in Jen’s arms, on the verge of breaking. He’s never seen her like this, not even when he was in the hospital bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened? What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She- she stopped breathing-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen turns to him, firm but kind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’ve got her. You need to breathe, okay? We all need to breathe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The curtain hasn't opened yet, but the compressions haven’t stopped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s still trembling in Jen’s arms when the ER doctor steps out, his gloves smeared faintly red. His expression is unreadable behind the mask.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He pulls it down with a slow exhale.</span>

<p>
<span>“She’s stable,” he says quickly, before either of them can spiral. “We got her pulse back, but she coded for nearly four minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand flies to her mouth. Jen tightens her grip on her waist to keep her grounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve put her in a medically induced coma,” he continues. “Her body’s in shock, between the fever and the trauma to her chest, we’re probably looking at pneumonia. She needs time to rest. To fight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For how long?” Agatha croaks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A few days, minimum. We’ll do a chest x-ray to confirm the diagnosis but right now, the coma gives us the best chance to keep her stable and minimize further damage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods numbly, but her gaze is locked on the closed curtain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will she…” she doesn't finish, doesn't even know which question to ask nor does she know if she wants to know the answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She may experience disorientation or memory loss when she wakes,” he says gently. “But she made it through the worst of it. That’s what matters right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’ll wake up,” Jen says with quiet certainty. “She has to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The curtain draws back, revealing the medical team preparing to move Rio from the ER bed to the ICU gurney. The beeping of the machines and the soft shuffle of feet echo in the otherwise quiet space. Agatha stands frozen, eyes glued to Rio’s still form as they carefully adjust the IV lines and shift her, their actions mechanical yet precise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A nurse steps forward, remorseful, but understanding. “I can only allow one in the room with her while we prepare everything, also I know this is the last thing on your mind right now, but we need to fill out her intake paperwork.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha feels torn. She looks to Rio, barely holding on, but she also knows she can’t leave Nicky alone in the waiting room, not after everything. Her gaze flicks to Rio, then to the doors where Nicky stands with his arms wrapped tight around himself, eyes red-rimmed and terrified. He’s trying to be strong, but he looks like a little boy again, the same way he had the night she carried him through those ER doors all those years ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She feels her chest split in two.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I-” she starts, but can’t finish.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen picks up on it immediately, stepping into the space between choice and consequence. “Go with her,” she says, gentle but insistent. “I’ll look after Nicky. You go be with Rio. She needs you right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallows hard, nodding once, grateful and aching. She brushes a hand on Jen’s shoulder in silent thanks and follows the nurse to the front desk, sparing one last glance back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s being wheeled out of the ER, tubes and wires trailing, her face pale against the pillow. A nurse calls out her vitals. The ICU doors swing open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t breathe again until they close behind her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s all my fault,” Nicky mutters, pacing the waiting room area like a caged animal. His steps are erratic, his breathing shallow. “I shouldn’t have said anything. I knew she wasn’t okay, and I just kept pushing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen watches him from one corner of the room, her arms folded and brows furrows. She was at the hospital giving a lecture to medical students and was just on her way out when she heard the commotion - Agatha’s voice, panicked, unmistakable, tearing through the ER like a siren.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t hesitated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now she watches on as Nicky unravels. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stops pacing, his shoulders rigid. “We were back at the penthouse. Rio was already sick, but she was up and moving when I came back from editing sessions with Billy, and I finally convinced him to be a part of the movie. That’s when they told me Rio is Lady Death-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s what?” Jen interrupts, extremely confused now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not important. Anyways, mama said that I couldn’t use her in the movie because and went on a rampage on how it would be fully uprooting Rio’s life more than it already is and I just snapped.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen waits, patient and quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was just trying to explain what the project menat, how it wasn’t some clout-chasing thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glances at him. “And?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I pushed,” he laughs, but there’s nothing amused about it. “I pushed and kept pushing. She said I was trying to turn Rio into a headline. That she wasn’t some mystery to solve - just a person who happened to save my life. And she was right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen furrows her brows. “Agatha said that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nods. “She stood between me and the door like I was the villain in the room. And I guess I was.” He exhales sharply. “Then I lost it. I said some awful shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen shifts toward him, her voice careful. “How awful?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky takes a seat on a synthetic cushion, hand dragging down his face. “I told her she was a coward. That the only reason she cleaned up was because she got pregnant. That she made saving me into some kind of PR stunt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s eyes widen. “Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” his voice cracks. “I didn’t mean it- not really. But I knew exactly where to aim.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen is quiet, letting the weight of that hang in the air for a second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told her she built a glass box around me. That she used me to erase who she was before - the rehab, the coke, the paparazzi. I told her I wasn’t her miracle, I was her redemption story.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Rio heard all of this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nods. “Yeah. She tried to stop us. I could hear it in her voice, how bad she was struggling, but I was so far gone that I couldn’t stop… And then, she started coughing. It was bad, and then blood started coming out…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen leans forward, eyes sharp now, but her voice steady. “And Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She didn’t even look at me. Just ran towards Rio before she hit the floor and told me to get the car.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen sighs, sitting back with a hand over her mouth. “Jesus, Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don't know if I’ve ever seen her that scared.” He stares at the floor like he can replay it, rewind, undo it. “I don’t even know how to fix it. I shouldn’t have said any of it. I just felt like she never listens. And I lashed out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s another beat of silence between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You need to let your mom cool off,” she finally says. “And when she’s ready, you need to apologize. For real. No justifications. No ‘but I was upset.’ Just own it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t even know if she’ll want to hear it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She will,” she says. “Eventually. But not right now, her focus is on Rio. Yours should be too, and school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nods, quietly. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re not going back to the penthouse,” she adds. “Not until we’re sure you won’t catch whatever Rio has. They’re thinking it’s pneumonia but the x-rays haven’t come back yet. You’re not exactly immune, even with the transplant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That lands hard. Nicky just nods again, smaller this time. “Yeah, I’ll go to Billy’s.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen watches him for another beat, then gently rests a hand on his shoulder. “We’ll get through this. You made a mistake. Now you’ve gotta grow from it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He doesn’t say anything else, but he nods - eyes red, throat tight - and finally leans back in the chair, still and silent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky sits there, exhausted, his mind spinning with everything he’s said and done, the weight of his actions pulling him deeper into himself. Jen doesn’t push further, just lets the silence stretch until it feels heavy enough to bear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then the door to the ICU room opens again, and Agatha steps out, her face drawn tight, but with a controlled composure. She doesn’t look at either of them immediately, her gaze falls briefly to the floor as she takes a steadying breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen,” she says softly, her voice gentle in its exhaustion. “It’s pneumonia. The x-rays came back. They’re starting her on a stronger antibiotic regimen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s eyes widen a bit, but her expression softens as she stands. “She’ll be okay, I’ll look over her treatment plan.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” she says, grateful. “I’m not leaving her side though. Go back to your practice, you have patients that need you. I’ll let you know if things change-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen cuts her off with a nod, understanding the unspoken tension in Agatha’s words. “Right, just look after yourself too, okay?” She moves towards the door, but before she exists, she pauses and looks back at Nicky, her expression full of unspoken words. She gives him a silent, understanding nod, then walks out of the waiting area, leaving Agatha and Nicky alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha takes a seat next to her son, the weight of the exhaustion pulling her down easily. Nicky shifts in his chair, the moment between him and Agatha stretching. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, she finally speaks, her voice softer than he’s used to hearing from her. “She’s right, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky glances up at her, eyes bloodshot and raw. “About what?”</span>
<span>“About you needing to apologize. Not just for what you said, but for how you handled it.” She places a comforting hand against his back, rubbing small circles into him. “I know you’re angry. I get that, you worked so hard and had a vision for this film, but to be a good filmmaker, you need to not see people as your subjects. Everyone on that set, the cast, crew, costume, props, they’re all people with lives they go home to at the end of the day.”</span>
<span>He sighs heavily, the weight of her words sinking in, but something else starts to shift inside him. His shoulder slump, the tension he’s been carrying unraveling just a bit. He knows she’s right - she used to spend her days on sets, but also he’s been so focused on his project that he forgot about the people around him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry mama,” he says suddenly, his voice barely above a whisper. It feels like a weight has finally lifted off his chest. “I should’ve never said the things I did to you. I was angry and frustrated. I didn’t know how else to handle everything.” He shakes his head, rubbing his hands over his face. “I shouldn’t have lashed out like that. You didn’t deserve it. I know you built the company to save me, you and Vis, I know that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha is quiet for a moment, her gaze steady and understanding. She doesn’t say anything at first, she doesn’t need to. The apology is enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Nicky isn’t done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know it wasn’t just about Rio, and it wasn’t about the movie either,” he continues. His words come faster now, like he’s trying to get everything off his chest before the weight of it pulls him under. “I’ve been so fixated on trying to prove that I could make a great film, I lost sight of the people behind it. I made you feel like I was accusing you of not caring, I made Rio feel like her own feelings don’t matter, and that’s not fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart aches at the rawness in his words. She brings her hand up to his shoulder, giving him a moment of comfort before speaking again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to be the same way,” she says, her voice quieter now, more reflective. “Always proving something, trying to convince everyone, even myself, that I could do it all alone.” She pauses, looking at the floor for a moment as though the weight of her own history settles over her. “I spent so many years pushing everyone away, thinking that if I didn’t rely on anyone, I wouldn’t get hurt. But the truth is, I wouldn’t have made it as far as I did without Wanda, Jen, Lilia, hell and even Vis.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looks up to her, surprised by the shift. “Lilia?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods slowly, a fond, wistful expression crossing her face. “Yeah, she was there from the beginning. She believed in me, supported me through everything and even when I was at rock bottom, she told me that if I couldn’t be better for myself, then I’d be damning any future kids I’d have. She always said that I didn’t have to do everything alone and eventually I finally listened.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky listens carefully, absorbing her words, feeling the weight of them. He’d never really known the full depth of Agatha’s journey, the struggles she faced before he was old enough to understand. He’d never known just how much LIlia had meant to her, and the thought of his mother going through everything alone is sobering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know,” he admits quietly. “I didn’t realize how much you’ve carried.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what a mother does, to protect her son from the harsh realities of life. But you don’t have to make the same mistakes I did. You have people you can open up to for guidance, Billy, your professors, even Wanda, she’s still in the industry and would love to give you some pointers on what she’s learned over the years.” She’s quiet for a moment. “Even Rio, in her own way. The point is, you have people that care about you and want to see you succeed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky closes his eyes for a moment, letting her words sink in. He wants to believe her, wants to understand that he doesn’t have to do everything by himself, that he can rely on others, just like his mother learned to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He opens his eyes and meets her gaze again, his voice softer, filled with sincerity. “I’m sorry mama. I’ve been trying to prove something to myself for so long that I forgot to see the people around me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile depends, and for the first time in a long time, she feels a sense of peace. She pulls him into a tight embrace, holding him for a moment as if to remind him that they don’t have to do this alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she pulls back, she hesitates. “I don’t want you to take this the wrong way but I don’t think you should stay at the penthouse for a while. Not until Rio’s better-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know mama, Jen already explained it to me. I already texted Billy and he’s letting me crash there. And Don’t worry, I won’t tell him about Rio being Lady Death,” he reassures with a small smile, hoping to lighten the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a breath, a brief flicker of amusement crossing her face before her expression softens again. “Good, I’m glad you’re staying with him. Just… take care of yourself okay? Try not to fall behind in classes, and call me whenever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will mama,” he promises, his voice steadier now, and for the first time in a while, he feels like he’s on the right track.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Five days have passed since the steady beep of the heart rate monitor became the only sound that marked the passing of time. Agatha’s eyes flutter open, bleary, and heavy from the exhaustion of constant worry. The room is dim, the soft lighting of the morning barely spilling in through the blinds, casting long shadows across the sterile walls of the hospital room. She hadn’t realized she’d drifted off, her mind was far too busy spinning through the last few days, keeping track of every heartbeat, every breath, and every change in Rio’s condition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But now, there’s a shift. The soft creak of the door opening breaks through her thoughts. Agatha turns her head sharply, expecting to see a nurse or maybe Nicky, but her breath catches when she sees who steps inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her business partner, Wanda’s husband, and the quiet yet steady presence in her life. His deep blue eyes soften when they meet hers, his lips curving into a faint smile as he steps forward, holding a small bag of clothes and a tray of food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t expect you to be awake yet,” he says in his usual calm tone, placing the items on the small table beside her bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinks in surprise, still blinking away the remnants of sleep. “What are you-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you might appreciate a break,” he says gently. “And a shower. I can take over for a little bit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stares at him for a moment, hesitating briefly. “Did Jen send you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He shakes his head. “No, Wanda told me what happened, and Nicky filled in the rest.” His eyes didn’t waver, just holding a small moment of understanding for all that’s occurred. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve known her since we were kids, Agatha, she’s a fighter. She’ll pull through,” he continues. “Go home, get a shower, clean up the house. I’ve given the office the day off. The nurse assured me they won’t take her off sedation until you come back, and I’ll call if there’s any news.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn't know what to say. The offer feels too kind, too selfless for someone she’s really only known in a professional setting. Over the years though, she learned that Vision never does anything without purpose, but right now, his generosity feels like a lifeline.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” she finally says, her voice hoarse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to thank me, I’m happy to help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaves the room, taking the bag of food and clothes with her, but not without sparing one last glance towards Rio’s lifeless form in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision replaces her seat and for a moment, he doesn’t know what to do with himself. All his life, he’s seen the problems in things, and wants to fix them. He can’t help it, it’s just the way his mind works.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s been a long time, Scout,” he says affectionately with a reminiscing smile on his face. “I suppose it’s my fault for that one. I should’ve checked in sooner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His words hang in the quiet room, and for a second he’s lost in the past. Vision’s thoughts drift back to elementary school, back to a time when everything seemed simpler, but in reality, it was far from it. Back then, he was the awkward, quiet kid, more interested in the way things worked than the way people did. His classmates always seemed to look past him, absorbed in their own worlds. He was still the kid with glasses who spent most of his recess time building structures with the wood chips on the playground instead of playing tag or football like the other kids. But even as he built his little towers, he couldn’t help but notice Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was the one who always seemed to be outside the fold, out there in the woods, beyond the schoolyard, always moving in her own rhythm, her own quiet universe. He remembers seeing her at lunch, sitting by herself, maybe looking at the clouds or sketching plants in a notebook. Her parents' minds were always at the park, and even at that young age, Rio had the air of someone who wasn’t really part of the social scene at school.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They’d both been isolated in their own ways, yet he never did anything about it. Maybe it was because he didn’t know how, or maybe because he was just too caught up in his own loneliness to reach out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision takes a breath, and the words come, quieter now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You probably don’t remember this, but I used to see you out there. You know, in the woods by the school.” His voice carries a hint of regret. “I always wondered what you were thinking. If you were lonely like I was. I was always just… in my own world, buried in books, trying to make sense of things. But I never said anything. Never checked in. I thought I could fix everything myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His gaze softens as he watches Rio. “I should’ve done something, said something. Should’ve been there for you, especially after your parents died.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a long pause as Vision looks down at his hands, almost as if he’s trying to piece together his thoughts before speaking again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was so wrapped up in my own world, that I didn’t think about what you might be going through. Even through adulthood, I knew you were always going to skip college and go straight into the woods. You loved it. I’d taken over the auto-shop and for a moment, we were both home. After your parents died, I just… There's no excuse. I was caught up in the new life that I was imagining with Wanda, but I could’ve made more of an effort to check in with you. I didn’t even say goodbye when I left for the city to get married. I never even told you why, or that I was leaving at all,” his voice cracks slightly, and for a moment, he just shakes his head, unsure how to carry on. “It feels wrong. It was wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A heavy silence fills the room, the weight of the years of neglect hanging between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, Rio. I should’ve been there more, when we were kids and even now. You were always out there alone, just like me in my own way, but you never had anyone, and I never extended that hand for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He leans back in the chair, trying to find some comfort in his own apology. “I don’t expect forgiveness, but I need you to know you were seen. I’ve seen what you’ve done for the park, and it’s a beautiful tale. Your parents would’ve been proud. I just wanted you to know that there’s always someone able to see through the shadows, even if you can’t tell. It was me back then, but maybe it’s Agatha now…” he trails off, letting the words settle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A few hours later, Vision’s still in his thoughts, a watchful eye on the steady rise and fall of Rio’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before he can say anything else, the door creaks again, signaling Agatha’s return. She steps back into the room, freshly showered and changed, her eyes tired but resolute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for that,” Agatha says, her voice still soft but steady. “I needed it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gives her a brief nod before looking back at Rio. He doesn't need to say anything more, she can see it in his eyes - guilt, regret, burden of everything unsaid. She’s been through her own share of that, and she knows what it’s like to carry it alone, but she also knows the power of being seen, of having someone show up when it counts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s strong,” he reassures quietly. “I know she doesn't look it right now, but she always has been. She’s got this way of silently fighting when it matters the most.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches him for a long moment, the weight of his words sinking in. “What do you mean?” She asks while pulling up a chair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I always thought that humans are… difficult to understand. Messy, illogical. Rio is no different. She’s always been one for the woods, never one to care what others said about it, no matter how cruel their words were.” He takes a brief moment to pause, thoughtful. “She used to come to school with mud on her boots, and twigs in her hair, like she just came straight out of the ground. People talked, as they do. Called her strange, sometimes worse. But she never gave them the satisfaction of seeing her flinch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His gaze drifts towards the heart monitors, the steady beeping providing the only sound of life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to think she kept to the woods because she didn't need people. Like her brain was wired differently, like mine, and I suppose it is, but it’s not solitude she was after, it was protection. She needed people, she just didn't trust that they’d see her clearly and stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He offers a wry smile. “The auto shop was my armor, the forest hers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods slowly, her expression unreadable but focused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Before you showed up, the town was just dormant. Then suddenly, the diner was louder, the people were talking again, rambling about the city kids causing trouble. But it wasn't trouble, it was life. You stirred something that had been asleep too long”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision lets the silence hang for a moment, his thoughts stretching with each lingering second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That week with Wanda,” he says gently, “she had no business being in an auto shop. Didn’t know a socket wrench from a tire iron, but she still tried. Her dreams were too big for Westview, we both knew it, and I thought I had to meet her where she was going. But she never asked that of me. She just wanted me - awkward, analytical, human in all the ways I tried to hide.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He rubs his palms together again, this time slower, more thoughtful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see that in Rio too. The need to disappear when you feel like you don’t measure up; like just existing out loud could break some preexisting equilibrium. She was never too much, the town just didn’t know what it had until she vanished into the woods and came back a myth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He glances toward the hospital bed, his voice dipping lower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She resurrected Westview, gave it a reason people came to visit. And then you-” he looks at Agatha, “you found her in the wreckage and didn’t try to fix her- not really I mean, but you don’t see her as a project or a legend. You saw a person, and you stayed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs lightly, the connection she’s been avoiding, the subconscious connection she’s felt towards Rio suddenly impossible to ignore. “I’ve had like three actual conversations with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision chuckles, the sound low but warm. “And yet, here you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifts in her chair, the reality of her connection sinking into her. “She nearly died saving Nicky, I couldn’t just walk away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you could’ve,” he says gently. “Most people wouldn’t have gone to all this trouble for a stranger. You did though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs, eyes flicking toward the bed where Rio lies motionless. “It’s different with her. She didn’t recognize me, I still don’t think she does. But somehow that’s what mattered, maybe it’s selfish.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pauses, her finger curling slightly on the armrest. “Everyone else sees the headlines. They look at me and decide what they want. But Rio… she just saw me. Or maybe she didn't see anything at all. But she didn't flinch. Even when I brought her to the penthouse, she didn't treat me any differently than someone with spare blankets.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice dips a little. “She was grateful, even stubborn about it, but even after she saw the person behind the walls, she didn't look at me any differently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finally looks at Vision, eyes slightly glossy but voice steady “Are you saying I’m what she needs?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He doesn't respond right away. His gaze lingers on Rio, on the stillness that walks the tightline of peace, and absence. Then he looks at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think,” he says slowly, words still forming in his brain, “people don't always know what they need, until they're on the verge of losing it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His words hit Agatha harder than she expected, nearly knocking out the air in her lungs. He offers a small apologetic smile, not for the truth but for the situation she’s found herself in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, he rises from the chair, joints cracking from sitting for so long. “I’ll hold things down at the office, don't worry about anything until she wakes up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision lingers at the door for a beat longer. “You’re doing more than you realize by being here, it matters. She’ll recognize that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He’s gone a moment later, leaving Agatha alone with her thoughts. It’s not unusual for her to have deep philosophical conversations with him, it’s part of the reason she chose him to build their company together, they push each other in ways no one else can, for the families of those who need it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence that follows feels vast and close, like the air itself had thickened. The only sound left is the soft whir of the machines and the distant hum of hospital life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A short while later, a nurse pushes through the door with a doctor in tow and explains the process to Agatha, but the words don't register. She already knows what they're going to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re beginning to taper the sedation,” the doctor says gently. “She may start to rouse shortly, over hours or days even. There's no exact timeline.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, once and tightly. Her eyes are still fixed on Rio. She hates this part, the in-between. The cruel breathless stretch of not knowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She may be disoriented when she wakes,” the nurse adds. “Confused, sometimes combative.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She won't be,” Agatha says, voice flat. “She’ll know me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse hesitates, but bites her tongue. The doctor mashes a note of something, then slips out with the nurse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She has to,” she whispers to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand drops to Rio’s. Cool, unmoving, with the steady heart rate monitors, maddeningly steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't know how much time passes before she speaks again, the sun well below the skyline now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re an insufferable asshole, you know,” she murmurs, low below her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lets the words hang for a moment, watching Rio’s form like the sudden shift in her attitude might provoke a response, but there is none.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans back in her chair, crossing her arms, laughing softly, teetering on the edge of amusement and despair. “I let you in, what, once? And you've hijacked my entire life, Rio. I don't do this. I don't get attached to patients. But you’re not just any patient. You saved my son,” she says again, softer this time as if the reminder alone is strong enough for them both. “And then you had the audacity to almost die on me, leaving your blood on my very expensive couch, thank god it’s leather.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighs, dragging a hand through her wavy hair. “I don't know what the hell I was thinking, bringing you into my home. Maybe I thought I could manage it. Keep some distance. Just repay a debt, make sure you were healed and send you back into the woods.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze lingers on Rio’s pale face, on the unnervingly relaxed complexion on her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you’ve made that impossible,” she goes on, quieter, more calm now. “You laid there, in my guest bedroom, not even knowing how to work a t.v.- god you looked at the remote like it was going to bite you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shakes her head, eyes softening, tears threatening to escape. “But you didn't ask for anything. Actually- I wish you would've. I wish you would've asked for painkillers or asked for help getting changed, don't think I didn't notice you change clothes with that massive bruise on your ribs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales shakily. “You were in pain and you didn't make a sound. God, I didn't think I’d miss it. I didn't realize how much I needed to hear that, because at least you were </span>
<em>
<span>there.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence grows thick with all the things she wants to say, but can't bring herself to admit, not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told myself this was just temporary. That this was just about, being a decent person,” her jaw tightens. “I didn't expect to </span>
<em>
<span>need</span>
</em>
<span> to see you up and around, to need you awake, to need you to be here. To need to hear your voice again, even if it's you refusing fucking Gatorade. I didn't plan on wanting to see you walk out of this room, I didn't plan on never wanting to see you set foot in another hospital again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice cracks, but she pushes through. “I didn't plan on needing you like this. But here we are, and I’m terrified of losing you.” She swallows, tasting the bitter teardrops spilling from her eyes. “You don't owe me anything, you didn't ask me for any of this, and I wasn't supposed to care, but I do. I tried to convince myself this wasn't real, but I guess I’ve been lying to myself for weeks now. I didn't ask for this attachment. But if I’m being honest, it scares the hell out of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She can feel the exhaustion taking over now. “I can’t lose you,” she whispers. “Please Rio, I want more time with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn't have anymore words left to say, the adrenaline gone from her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha links her fingers loosely with Rio’s and lets the silence linger on. She’ll wait as long as she has to until she gets to hear Rio’s infuriating voice again.</span>

<p>
<span>The scent of coffee wakes Rio up. The sheets are comfortable, familiar, so worn that she’s hesitant to replace them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She picks her head up, taking in the room around her. Familiar green paint and posters on her wall coming into focus. Her childhood bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moves around her room, picking up an old t-shirt and a pair of cargo pants effortlessly. Slowly, she descends the staircase to hear familiar laughter coming from the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her parents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father stands by the stove, flipping pancakes with exaggerated flair, while her mother hums along to a half-remembered tune, pouring coffee into mismatched mugs. LIght spills in through the windows in warm, honeyed ribbons.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning sleepyhead,” her mom greets. “We made your favorite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s all so easy. So painfully normal. Rio slides into the seat at the table, fingers brushing the surface worn smooth by years of family meals and school projects and lazy Sunday mornings. The coffee smells exactly right. Her father grins at her, the same crooked smile he wore every time he pretended not to burn breakfast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It feels like peace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mamí? I thought you guys were in Australia?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We came back,” she says warmly, like it’s the most natural thing in the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father slides a jar across the table. “We brought you back something.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, nestled in soft moss, is a perfect bloom of kangaroo paw. Vibrant red and yellow, almost glowing. It seems to pulse gently in the morning light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't question where it came from. She just stares at it, heart swelling. “It’s beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother reaches out, brushes a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “Eat up cariño, we have a hike to finish.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” her father adds, grinning. “It’s finally time we conquer the Road together, there’s something I want to show you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finishes breakfast without another word, basking in the warmth and familiarity of having her parents here. It’s perfect, almost too perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The laughter, the smell of coffee. The way the sunlight slants just right through the window, catching in her mother’s hair like a halo. It all feels orchestrated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she doesn’t question it. She doesn’t want to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she helps clear the table, her movements automatic. Her mother hums a tune she hasn’t heard in years - something Rio can’t name, but knows in her bones. Her father claps her on the shoulder as help passes, the same wordless affection he always gave instead of ‘I love you.’</span>
</p><p>
<span>They step outside into the sunlight. Not a cloud in sight. The car is already idling in the driveway, awaiting their adventure to the Park.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No one says where they’re going. They don't need to. The tired crunch over gravel and loose stone, winding them away from the house. Trees blur past the windows. They pass through Main Street of Westview, but there’s no people. The storefronts are boarded up, paint peeling from signs she used to read on the way back from school. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, they arrive at the park. There’s no other cars in the lot. Wordlessly, they venture into the entryway of the hiking trails, her father taking the lead northwestern area of the park, passing the familiar trail sign of ‘The Road’ nailed to a strong tree.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The path is familiar. Rio notices the way the roots knot like old fingers, the way the light pools in certain places. She could walk it blindfolded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She trains her fingers along the trees as they pass, pausing where her initials are carved into bark - her handwriting, clumsy and young. </span>
<em>
<span>R.V. ‘93</span>
</em>
<span>, a heart half faded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father sees her looking. “Your checkpoint,” he remarks with a fond smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiles faintly at the memory. “I remember crying when I thought the tree would die.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother laughs softly. “You were always so gentle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The trail dips. The smell of pine thickens. They’re about a quarter of the way there now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father shifts beside her, voice lighter than air. “So what’s it like? Living out here full time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pauses. “Quiet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He hums thoughtfully. “Always thought you liked quiet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do,” she replies. “It’s peaceful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mom glances over at her, eyes soft. “Are you happy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitates. Her feet keep moving. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The park is all I’ve known. I got used to being out here,” her voice feels smaller than the trees around them.   </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother slows, letting her fingers skim the edge of a fern. “Getting used to something doesn’t mean it’s what you need.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t respond. The wind rustles overhead, leaves brushing together like whispers. She thinks she can hear something unnatural in the air, like a soft snoring or weeping, but she can’t figure it out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you guys hear that?” She asks her parents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both turn to her, confused. “Hear what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head, trying to rid the audio from her ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They keep walking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A short while later, they come across a cliff, with an old creaky bench near the edge. In the middle, sit three white ghost orchids, one of the many tokens Rio had left for tourists.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey there,” her father says to the flower. “How did you get up here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I- I may have taken some flowers from the garden and turned into a myth,” Rio says hesitantly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her parents look at her, no judgement, just warmth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father chuckles softly, taking the orchid in his hand. “You always did have a flair for the dramatic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They take a seat on the bench, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. “You made something beautiful out of your grief, mija. That’s not a bad thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers brush the petals of the orchids - cool and soft and too real for a dream. The wind stirs her hair gently, like a breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There, there it is again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That sound. Not the forest, not her parents, not her own heartbread. It’s deeper. Murmured voices. Both of them familiar, one distorted by tears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>She needs time, she’ll pull through.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I didn’t know how bad it was…”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s head snaps up, but her parents are gone. The bench is empty. The flowers are wilting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rises quickly, panic rising in her throat, but it’s instantly soothed when she sees her parents behind her, ready to keep moving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come, we have to keep moving,” her mother says gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows the panic, falling into step between them. Her fingers itch with questions, but her tongue feels too thick to ask them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walk in silence, the path narrowing. The trees seem taller now, denser, their leaves whispering things she can’t quite reach. Light filters through in odd patterns, flickering like it’s passing through water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father finally speaks up. “Do you ever wish it had gone differently?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks at him. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything,” he says, not looking at her. “The park, the accident, the isolation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what else I’d do. I’m not- I’m not sure what I’d do with the space outside of this.” She gestures vaguely as if the trees and the path could explain the depth of what she feels.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother glances at her. “You’ve always been strong, mija. But strength isn’t just about surviving. Sometimes it’s about letting yourself live.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows hard, the weight of their words sinking deeper than she’s prepared for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence stretches between them as they continue down the path, the flickering shadows growing longer around them,</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio stops. Her hand shakes as she reaches for her chest, pressing it there as if to steady her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know how to be anything else,” she says, quieter now, as if it’s more of a confession than an answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother’s eyes soften. “You don’t have to figure it all out now, mija. Just take it one step at a time. And remember, there’s people around you who can help along the way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence engulfs them once again, then a voice again. Familiar, one she didn’t expect.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You were seen.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The voice comes out of nowhere, soft but clear, cutting through the silence like a whisper in the wind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s body goes still, her heart skipping a beat. The words hang in the  air, a strange echo that doesn’t quite belong in this space. She turns towards the sound, her breath catching in her throat. But there’s no one there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her parents continue walking, as if they hadn’t heard the voice at all, their figures moving farther ahead on the path.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinks, her chest tight. There’s no explanation for it. Was it part of the dream? Or something more… something real?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glances around the woods, the trees standing like silent witnesses to her uncertainty. A shiver runs down her spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother looks over her shoulder, sensing her daughter’s absence. “Rio, mija? What’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did- did you hear that?” Rio asks, voice trembling slightly. Her parents exchange a look, then shake their heads.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, cariño. What did you hear?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opens her mouth to explain, but the words catch in her throat. Was it real? Was it a memory? A fragment of her own thoughts?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I- I don’t know,” she finally says, shaking her head, trying to push the sensation aside. “Nevermind”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother gives her a small smile, extending her hand. “Come on, let's keep moving. We’re almost there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The path ahead seems darker now, the forest more oppressive, but Rio follows them anyways, her mind spinning. The weight of the unspoken words pressing harder with each step.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon enough, they reach the ridge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The path narrows as the trees thin out, giving away to a sweeping view of the valley below. The wind picks up, rustling through the leaves and carrying the scent of pine and earth. Rio breathes deeply, as if trying to gather the strength to climb the last few feet to the top. Her parents move ahead, stepping over rocks and roots with the ease of those who know this land like the back of their hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio doesn’t feel at ease. She stops at the edge of the ridge, her gaze drawn down toward the jagged rocks far below. The memories flood in - sharp, like a crack of lightning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was dangling off the edge, clinging to the rocks with desperate fingers. His body trembling with fear, eyes wide with panic. She’d tied the knot around the tree haphazardly, her hands shaking as she worked, the rope too loose, the tension building as the seconds stretched longer than they should have.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fall. The weightlessness. The instant before it all shattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feels the ground shift beneath her as if the earth itself is giving way, and her chest tightens. The sense of falling, of weightlessness, grips her gut, but there's no rope to save her this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart hammers in her chest, a frantic rhythm she can’t escape. Her grip tightens on the jagged rock edge beneath her, nails digging into the stone as if it could anchor her in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then a voice, familiar and agonizingly real, cuts through the storm swelling in her chest. It’s like the wind carries it from a distance, a sound, a presence, a reminder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You’re an insufferable asshole…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You didn’t ask for anything…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I need you to be here…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I wasn’t supposed to care, but I do…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I can’t lose you… please Rio, I want more time with you.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The words swirl around her, each one a promise she wasn’t sure she could ever live up to. She wants to reach for them, to hold on to them, but they’re slipping away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The wind picks up again, rustling through the trees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looks around, eyes frantic, searching for her parents. There, on the edge of the ridge, their familiar figures stand - no fear, no hesitation. Just warmth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father’s crooked grin. Her mother’s soft eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, they’re everything she remembers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opens her mouth to speak, but the words catch in her throat. This isn’t just a dream - it’s the goodbye she never got.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She steps forward, her heart beating in her throat. Her voice trembles, quiet, as if she’s afraid to say it out loud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry… I’m sorry I pushed you guys to go on that vacation. I’m sorry I didn’t take over the park. I’m sorry I couldn’t be what you needed me to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother’s gaze softens, the weight of unspoken words hanging between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We never blamed you mija. You don’t have to be anything but yourself,” her mother says gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father steps forward, clapping on her shoulder. “You’ve always known what you needed, even if it didn’t always look like what we thought.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a shaky breath, nodding, the weight of their presence surrounding her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” she whispers, barely audible as she steps into their warm embrace. “For everything. I love you and I miss you everyday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother’s arms wrap around her, pulling her close, holding her like she did when Rio was small and the world felt safe. “We’ll always be here, mija,” her mother murmurs, voice thick with emotion. “In you, always.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The warmth of their arms lingers, but slowly, they pull away, walking toward the path that leads to the cabin. The air feels heavier now, the weight of their departure settling over Rio, but it’s not sadness. It’s peace. The kind that comes with knowing that, while things have changed, love still remains.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches them disappear down the path, heart heavy with all the unsaid things. But the space between them is filled with something more profound than regret. It’s acceptance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turns back to the ridge, a voice echoing in her mind, a voice she didn’t realize she wanted to hear more of.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I can’t lose you… please Rio, I want more time with you.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath catches, and in that moment, she realizes: the past is behind her, and the future is calling. She isn’t ready to walk away from it just yet.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha stirs, blinking against the pale light filtering in from the windows. Her neck aches, her muscles stiff from being hunched over the bed for so long. She hadn’t meant to fall asleep. Her fingers are still entwined in Rio’s right hand, but as she tries to shift, a soft, warm pressure brushes through her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At first it feels like a dream, but then she hears something that’s not a machine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s groan is faint, thick with sleep and something heavier, like it’s pushing through fog just to reach her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha freezes, not sure if she’s dreaming. But then the fingers tangle in her hair tighten just slightly, enough to pull her back from the haze of sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Agatha whispers, exhaustion clouding her voice, but her pulse quickens anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flicker open, not fully, but just enough for Agatha to see the dim, struggling focus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh, it’s okay, I’m here.” She says gently, squeezing Rio’s hand, trying to steady her breathing, trying to hold onto any ounce of calm that could make this easier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio’s face contorts slightly, a wince passing through her features as if she wants to say something more, but it’s too much to form. She struggles for breath, and her eyes close again, slipping back into unconsciousness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans back, frustration building. She feels the ache of Rio’s struggle, feels it deep in her chest. “I’m right here,” she murmurs softly, brushing her thumb over the back of Rio’s hand. “Just breathe, you’re going to be okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Minutes pass before Rio stirred again, her fingers twitching in Agatha’s grasp. This time, when her eyes flutter open, they stay open for a few seconds longer, though they still seem distant. Rio’s voice is barely more than a rasp. “Not… an asshole…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinks, caught off guard. Her brow furrows. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips curl slightly, a faint lopsided attempt at a smile. “Not an asshole,” she repeats, though it was more like a dry murmur than a sentence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A laugh bubbles from Agatha’s chest, surprised by the shift in Rio’s demeanor, even in her state. “You’re not an asshole,” she agrees quietly, her voice soft but full of tenderness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyelids flutter again, the effort of starting awake pulling her under once more. Her breath deepens as if trying to fight sleep, but Agatha can feel the exhaustion settling back in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…” Agatha whispers, her voice barely louder than a breath. “You’re gonna get through this. Just hang in there a little longer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio doesn’t answer this time. Instead, she slips back into unconsciousness, her hand still loosely holding Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Agatha just watches her, heart hammering in her chest. </span>
<em>
<span>She’s awake. She’s here.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a shaky breath, her shoulders loosening as she leans forward, pressing her forehead gently against Rio’s. “Come back to me, Rio,” she whispers, just for herself, before straightening up again, pushing back the weight of her fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Minutes turn into hours. Agatha never moves from Rio’s side. She rubs her eyes, pushing back the overwhelming weight of worry that hangs over her. A nurse finally comes in, disrupting the stillness of the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How is she?” the nurse asks, walking toward the bed with a clipboard in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t take her eyes off Rio. “She’s in and out, struggling to stay awake but she said something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse steps closer, checking Rio’s vitals. “That’s normal after a trauma like this. We just need to keep monitoring her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, but it doesn't ease the tightness in her chest. Her gaze never leaves Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse is speaking, but Agatha barely hears. All that matters is Rio. She squeezes the woman’s hand, willing her to stay with her, stay in this moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart flutters in her chest as Rio stirs again, her eyes slowly creeping open, blinking as if adjusting to the world around her. Her breath catches in her throat, unsure if she’s imagining it, if this is really happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” She asks softly, her voice a whisper, barely louder than a breath. She leans in a little closer, eyes searching Rio’s face. “Do you- do you know who I am?” The question slips out before she can stop it, quiet and vulnerable, a crack in the armor she’s carefully built over the past few hours.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze flickers and for a moment, it’s like she’s reaching for something in the dark - something familiar but too far to grasp. Her eyes flicker, unsure, distant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitches, her pulse quickening. She wonders, for the first time since Rio woke up, if she might not remember, if she’s been holding onto hope for nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Agatha presses gently, her voice trembling with uncertainty, something raw and exposed slipping through. “Please…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow furrows slightly, and she opens her mouth, but no words come out. Instead she just blinks at Agatha, too exhausted to form a response. The silence stretches between them, heavy with the weight of the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha can’t help it. Her eyes burn, the threat of tears edging at the corners. She wants to say more, but the words don’t come. All she can do is hold Rio’s hand tighter, hoping that she remembers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then finally, after what feels like an eternity, Rio blinks again - her gaze clearer now, focused like a light slowly flickering on. She looks at Agatha for a long moment, then a faint recognition stirs. Her lips part, and she whispers, barely audible, but enough to make Agatha’s heart skip. “The kid… Did he…,” she trails off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath catches in her throat, a wave of relief sweeps over her, but it’s fragile - she’s not sure if Rio truly remembers or if it’s just a passing fragment, a memory that slips through her fingers. But it’s enough. Just hearing Rio remember Nicky is enough for her heart to skip a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” she says, her voice thick with emotion, a soft, trembling smile breaking through her relief. “You saved him.” Her eyes shine with unshed tears, but she forces a breath, trying to stay steady. “He’s safe, Rio. You saved him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes drift closed again, her breath shallow as she seems to slip back into unconsciousness. Agatha watches her, her hand still holding Rio’s, not willing to let go, even if Rio doesn’t fully remember her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here,” Agatha whispers again, her voice softer now, a hint of hope threading through the words despite the uncertainty. “I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a long moment, the room is quiet, save for the steady beeping of the machines and the soft rustle of the sheets. Agatha stays by her side, hoping that Rio’s mind will catch up with her body, hoping for that spark of recognition that can let her breathe again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment Rio stirs again, it feels different. Agatha’s heart leaps into her throat as her fingers still rest in Rio’s. Her eyes trace the subtle movement beneath her eyelids, the soft fluttering of her lashes as if she’s about to wake, but something in the stillness tells her this might shatter her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, it happens. Rio's eyes slowly crack open, but there’s no recognition there, no trace of the person Agatha has been talking to, fighting for, for so long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Agatha breathes out, a desperate whisper, trying to cling to the hope that something - anything - will snap into place. She leans forward, her voice softer now, filled with uncertainty. “Rio, do you know who I am?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks, her gaze empty, unfocused, like she’s staring through Agatha instead of at her. There’s nothing here, not even a flicker of recognition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I… I…” Rio’s voice cracks, tentative, a far-off echo. “No…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The word hits Agatha like a punch in the stomach. She feels the ground beneath her tremble, her grip tightening around Rio’s hand instinctively, even though she feels like she’s losing her hold on everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No…” Agatha whispers, her chest tightening. Her pulse is racing, and for a moment, she’s paralyzed. She can’t breathe. “Rio, please, you know me. You… you saved Nicky, you-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio’s face remains blank, her brow furrowing as she struggles to make sense of the words, as if they don’t belong to her, like they're a puzzle she can’t solve. She looks at Agatha with confusion, with nothing but a vacant expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who are you?” Rio asks, her voice trembling slightly, the vulnerability raw and clear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitches, but she forces herself to stay calm. She needs to stay calm. She’s been through worse, she tells herself, but this? This is different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m Agatha,” she says, her voice shaking as she tries to keep it steady. “I’m… I’ve been here. I-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the words catch in her throat. Her fingers tremble around Rio’s hand, and the tears she’s been holding back begin to burn, unbidden, and unrelenting. The weight of the moment crashes over her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just stares at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I… I don’t remember,” Rio whispers, almost apologetically, as though she wishes she could, as though she wants to say more but can’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s vision blurs, her hands shaking uncontrollably now as the reality sinks in. “No, Rio…” Her voice cracks. “You have to remember. Please, I need you to remember. I need you… I can’t…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words fall away, lost in the overwhelming flood of emotions she can’t suppress. The woman who had started to mean everything to her, her quiet strength, her annoying stubbornness, was slipping away. And Agatha, even with all the strength she'd managed to keep through it all, felt like she was going to drown in this moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath comes faster, shallow, as panic threatens to tear through her. The tightness in her chest becomes unbearable. Rio doesn’t remember her. She doesn’t even remember the accident, the pain, the bond that had been forming between them. The tears start to spill, despite her best efforts to stay composed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, Rio,” Agatha chokes out, her voice breaking. “You don’t… you don’t- you don't know how much I need you to remember.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes soften at the sight of Agatha’s distress, but she still doesn’t know what to do with it. She’s lost in a haze of confusion, caught in the gaps of her own memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha can say anything more, the door creaks open, and a nurse steps inside, catching the raw moment unfolding. She quickly moves toward the bed, but Agatha doesn’t even acknowledge her. She’s still holding Rio’s hand, her sobs quiet but relentless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse looks between them, concerned. “Agatha, maybe you should step outside for a moment-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Agatha’s voice is firm despite the tears. She shakes her head, not taking her eyes off Rio, not wanting to let go of her even for a second. “I’m not going anywhere. Not this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the nurse steps closer, her hands resting gently on Agatha’s shoulders, offering comfort, even though Agatha can’t bring herself to accept it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you need to breathe,” she says, her tone soft but insistent. “She’s still confused. It’s normal after a trauma like this. You need to give her time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse gently guides Agatha away from the bedside. At first, she resists, frozen around Rio’s, but then she lets go. Barely. Like it hurts her fingers to release it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just for a moment,” she says softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods wordlessly and steps back, retreating into the corner of the room like a shadow of herself. She presses her back to the wall, arms crossed tight over her chest, trying to stay upright, trying to keep the pieces of herself from spilling out. Her breaths come shallow, unsteady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse turns back to Rio, her voice calm and clinical. “Sweetheart, do you know your name?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow furrows. “Rio…?” It’s a question. Not an answer. “I…don’t know. She keeps calling me that…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words echo in the room, and Agatha’s hand flies up to her mouth, eyes wide, wounded all over again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s okay,” the nurse says gently, brushing a hand over Rio’s forehead to check her temperature. “Memory loss is common. We’ll take it slow. Do you know what you do for work?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks, her eyes drifting toward the window before settling on the nurse again. “I’m a… ranger,” she says, tentative but certain. “I take care of the woods.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse smiles, encouraging. “That’s right. You’re a park ranger in Westview.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales, a small breath of relief at the confirmation. “I remember trees,” she murmurs. “And a trail… it’s dangerous… It’s a weird name with a ridge…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>From the corner, Agatha lets out the softest sob - it barely makes a sound, but it’s enough to draw Rio’s attention. She turns her head slowly toward the woman in the corner, the one with red-rimmed eyes and a look that makes something twist in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s been here,” Rio says quietly to the nurse. “I don’t know why…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse gives a gentle nod. “That’s Agatha. She’s been by your side every day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes stay locked on her. Agatha doesn’t speak, can’t - she feels too raw, too exposed. All she can do is nod and take a shuddering breath, afraid to scare her further if she speaks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t remember,” Rio whispers, guilt settling like fog around her ribs. “But I don’t… want her to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s knees nearly give out. The only thing keeping her upright is the wall behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse gently pats Rio’s arm. “She’s not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finishes checking the monitors, murmuring something about vitals stabilizing and needing to update the doctor. She squeezes Rio’s hand, then turns to Agatha with a reassuring nod. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll give you two a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the door clicks shut behind her, silence blooms in the room - heavy, aching, delicate. Agatha doesn’t move at first. She’s still in the corner, one hand braced against the wall, the other pressed flat over her chest like she’s holding something in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, still lying in the bed, turns her head slightly, her brow furrowing as she looks toward Agatha. “I don’t remember you,” she says, her voice quiet, apologetic. “But… I should.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart cracks at the words. She stands frozen, unable to move. The raw pain in her chest threatens to spill over, but she swallows it back, forcing herself to keep it together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I… I don’t want to forget you,” Rio whispers, a mix of confusion and longing in her tone. “I don’t know why, but it feels wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally exhales, stepping forward, though each step feels like it takes everything she has. She reaches the bedside, but her hand hovers just above Rio’s. She couldn’t bring herself to touch her, not yet, not when Rio’s so unsure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You haven’t forgotten me,” Agatha says, her voice hoarse, barely above a whisper. “You’re just… confused. You’ve been through so much, Rio. You don’t have to remember everything right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to hurt you,” Rio murmurs, her gaze shifting from Agatha to the blanket in her lap, tracing the fabric with her fingers as if trying to make sense of it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath catches in her throat. “You’re not. You never have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flicker back to hers. “I feel like I’ve lost so much… And you- you’re here, but I don’t understand why. I don’t know why I can’t remember you.” Her voice wavers, thick with emotion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closes her eyes for a moment, the weight of Rio’s words settling heavily inside her. “I’m here because… because I care about you. More than you know. More than I should.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowns. “More than you should? But… I don’t even know you. Why are you saying that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitates, struggling to find the right words. “I took you in because you saved my son. We’ve barely spoken and I never expected to feel like this, but… you matter to me. I don’t know how, but you do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know you, and you don’t know me,” Rio mutters, as if testing the statement against some internal justice system</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha whispers, voice trembling. “But it doesn’t change anything. I care about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softens, but the confusion is still there. “I don’t remember you. I don’t know why you’re so upset. But… I can feel something. You’re important.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks at her, trying to make sense of it all. “I’m sorry… I don’t remember you, but I don’t want you to leave either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles through the pain, her voice quiet but steady. “I’m not going anywhere.”</span>

<p>
<span>Hours later, Agatha stands in the hospital room, the sterile smell of disinfectant hanging thick in the air, a complete wreck. True to her word, she’s been unable to leave Rio’s side, her exhaustion creeping up on her as she watches Rio sleep, her breathing steady but shallow, the faint beep of machines marking time; she can’t tear her eyes away from her, even as her mind begins to fray at the edges.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzes in her pocket, pulling her out of her spiraling thoughts. She pulls it out to find ‘Kooky Witch’ across the screen. She answers it with a quick swipe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha? How’s she doing?” Lilia’s voice is steady but carries a note of concern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a slow breath, her eyes never leaving Rio. “She’s physically stable. But… she doesn’t remember me. She doesn’t remember anything about how she ended up here. It’s like I’m a stranger to her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s voice softens, understanding in each word. “Oh sweetie, I know this must be hard, but you’re doing the right thing. You’re there. She knows that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know how much longer I can do this,” she admits quietly, swallowing the lump in her throat. “She woke up this morning and I already feel like I failed her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia doesn’t hesitate. “Agatha… have you thought about going to an NA meeting? I know it’s hard with everything going on, but maybe take a moment to center yourself. You’ve been carrying so much on your own.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The suggestion hits Agatha like a ton of bricks. She closes her eyes briefly, shaking her head as if trying to clear the fog. “I… I can't leave her. I haven’t had any impulses, but she just woke up and doesn't even know her own name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s tone is calm, almost gentle. “It’s okay to need a moment, Agatha. You don’t have to do this alone. You’ve been holding everything together for so long. It might help to take a step back and breathe for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers tighten around the edge of the bed as she looks at Rio’s peaceful face. “I’ll think about it. But right now, I just… I can’t walk away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a brief pause before Lilia speaks again, her voice steady. “I’m here. Always. You know that right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallows hard. “I know. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a soft sigh, Agatha ends the call and dials Jen. The phone rings twice before Jen picks up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha? What’s happening?” Jen’s voice is sharp with concern. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sinks into the chair, her hand clutching the edge of the mattress. “She woke up, but she doesn’t remember anything. I don’t know how much of what’s happening is real for her anymore. She doesn’t remember me, I don’t know how to fix this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s voice softens. “You don’t have to fix it. Just be there for her. That’s enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She doesn't know who she is,” Agatha says, her voice cracking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re carrying a lot right now,” she immediately reassures her. “You’ve been doing this alone. It’s okay to ask for help. You don’t have to shoulder all of this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been thinking about calling Vision,” she says, the thought lingering in her mind. “Maybe someone from home can jog her memory.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's a good idea, you know he’d drop everything for you, shut HMX down for the day. You’ve got to give yourself a break.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a breath, then she speaks. “I’ll call him. Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She dials Vision’s number next, staring at Rio as the phone rings. After a few seconds, Vision’s voice answers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha? How’s Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales. “Physically, she’s doing better. The pneumonia is under control. But she’s still so confused. She doesn’t recognize me, doesn't even remember how she got here. I hate to ask-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can come by first thing in the morning,” he immediately says. “I’ll keep Nicky in the dark, if he knew, it’d break his heart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks Vis. I really- I don’t know what I’d do without you”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re family Agatha. We’ll get through this”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After hanging up, Agatha feels a small flicker of relief. She’s not alone in this, not anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The morning light slips in quietly through the blinds, painting the hospital walls in a hush of gold. The beeping of machines continues its steady rhythm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts beneath the sheets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightens from her chair in an instant, blinking herself awake. “Rio?” she says softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flutter open, unfocused at first, but not alarmed. She takes a breath, then slowly turns her head toward the voice. Her gaze lands on Agatha, lingers there for a beat - long enough to stir hope - but no spark of memory ignites.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still at the hospital,” Agatha says, voice measured, gentle. “You’re okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows, her throat dry. “What… what day is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thursday. You’ve been out for a few days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows knit together, a faint wince of effort. “Shouldn’t you be at work?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha can answer, the door opens quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision steps in, all calm and presence and quiet concern. He sets a coffee cup on the windowsill, then fully turns to Rio. “Morning Scout.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks, her gaze sharpening at the moment it falls on him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“...Robert?” she rasps, squinting at him like she’s remembering a face from a very old photograph.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision stops in his tracks, stunned into stillness. Then a grin breaks across his face - small, surprised, but real. “You remembered my name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowns faintly, like the memory won't sit still. “You fixed my dirt bike. You… live near the post office?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” he says, pulling up a chair. “Not anymore, moved to the city about twenty years ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches them, her chest tight with something between relief and longing. Rio hadn't looked this way yet, but it’s something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turns her head toward Agatha again. There’s more clarity in her gaze now. Not quite recognition, but a softening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know him,” she murmurs, as if trying to figure out why she doesn’t know her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha whispers, forcing a smile. “That’s why I asked him to come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods slowly. “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They settle into a soft kind of rhythm. He’s telling her about a squirrel she befriended at the edge of the playground at recess and even convinced their teacher, Mrs. Davis, to try and keep it as a class pet. Rio even manages a small smile - tired but real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches from her seat across the room, hands clasped tightly in her lap. There’s no malice in her. Just a quiet ache that she can’t ignore. That it wasn’t her Rio she recognized. The light in her eyes hadn’t sparked for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stands up slowly, brushing invisible dust from her coat. Vision glances her way, picking up on the shift in energy. Rio does too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re leaving?” Rio asks, her voice more alert than before. There’s something in her tone - something concerned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forces a smile. “Just for a little while. I need some air.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision’s brow furrows slightly, but he says nothing. He knows her well enough not to push.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, though, doesn’t let it slide. “Did I… say something wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That stops Agatha in her tracks. She turns back, her expression soft but worn. “No, Rio. I just- need a minute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision stands, crossing his arms. “You sure you don’t want me to drive you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shakes her head. “I’m going to the courtyard. I just… I need to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That earns her a sympathetic, approving look from him. “I understand, be safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lingers for one last glance at Rio. “I’ll be back soon, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods, though she watches her go with a furrowed brow. Her instincts are waking up - even if the memories aren’t. Something’s off, and she feels it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the door shuts behind Agatha, the room is quieter somehow. Vision pulls his chair a little closer, resting his elbows on his knees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s been here since the beginning, you know,” he says, watching Rio carefully. “Hasn’t left your side.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks slowly, her eyes distant but thoughtful. “I know,” she whispers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sits against the cool stone bench in the courtyard, holding the joint in her fingers. She grabbed it when she went to her house a few days ago, hoping she didn't need it but just in case.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She fiddles with it as she debates her decision. The filter is slightly bent. She exhales through her nose, frustrated. Like she’s mad at herself for even considering it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A long moment passes. The wind ruffles through her coat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lights it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first drag is harsh, catching at the back of her throat. She doesn't cough - she’s used to it, but it burns anyway. Not just the smoke. The choice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She presses her elbow to her knee and cradles her forehand in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This isn't about Rio’s coma. Not entirely. It’s the weight of everything that came before. The realization that she almost lost Nicky. The way Rio didn't recognize her. The way that no matter how much tech she’s made and how many families she’s helped, she can't fix amnesia. She can't fix Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shuts her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The high doesn't offer her escape - not like it used to. It slows things down, dulls the sharpest edges, but everything underneath still throbs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzes in her pocket. She doesn't check it right away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>

<span> She’s asking about you.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stares at the words. Simple. Unassuming. And somehow, they hit harder than they should.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
<span> What are you saying?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn't expect a reply right away, but it comes back quickly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>The Robot: </b>
<span>That you’ll be back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A beat, then another message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>The Robot:</b>
<span> She seems sad.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lowers the phone, staring at the glowing tip of the joint.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She suddenly feels stupid for lighting it. Like she blinked and became someone she’d thought she’d outgrown.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stubs it out on the edge of the bench and slides it back in the tin like putting away a weapon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers linger over her phone again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha: </b>
<span>I'll be right up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pockets the tin, standing slowly. The wind has picked up now, tugging at her sleeves like it’s hurrying her along.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glances up at the windows above. Somewhere behind that glass, Rio is waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even if she doesn't remember her yet - Agatha still wants to be the one she wakes up for.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as the door clicks shut, Rio feels a piece of her missing. It doesn't make sense, she doesn't remember Agatha, but she remembers Robert.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you and Agatha know each other?” She asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision leans back in his chair, one ankle crossed over a knee. He’s quiet for a moment, thoughtful. He watches Rio carefully, like he’s gauging whether she really wants the truth or just the polished version.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He plays it safe. “We met almost thirty years ago. I married her best friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows etch. “You said you haven't lived in Westview in twenty years…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gives a small smile, glad she remembers small details even in her state. “They came through Westview during spring break, their car broke down and they worked to pay off the repairs. It’s how I met Wanda. Agatha worked at the park with Lilia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks at him puzzled, then glances to the door, as if she expected Agatha to appear any moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She doesn't look like she could last a minute there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision chuckles at the memory of Agatha causing hell to anyone passing through the park. “She barely lasted a week before scaring off all the hikers, but secretly, she loved it. Not for the trees and nature, but for Lilia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My parents' friend…?” Rio asks tentatively. It feels right, but she doesn't know if it’s true.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” He gives a small, satisfied nod, but his smile is still sad. “They created a plan to save the park. Do you remember that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thinks for a few moments, and briefly, Vision thinks she doesn't. “I remember flowers, and a mask.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was Lady Death’s tokens to the travelers. She’d visit them in the night, leave them, occasionally scare them, but then disappear. It got people talking and made people visit Westview.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers twitch against the blanket, like the memory stirs in her body before her mind catches up. Her eyes stay on the ceiling, unfocused, like she’s seeing something that isn't there anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I remember… shadows,” she says finally. “Hiking trails in the dark, and sadness. I didn't want to be seen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision nods, voice quieter now. “You were never meant to be seen. That was the point. But you made it real, you became her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows hard. “Did Agatha know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She helped build the myth,” he says gently. “She didn't know it was you at first. Not until you saved Nicky and Lilia told her everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio can ask another question, the door clicks back open and Agatha walks back in. Her steps are slow and unsteady. She pauses for a moment, as if assessing the room, before walking in further. A faint scent of smoke lingers in the air and Rio notices how Agatha’s movements are a little more languid than usual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision notices immediately, eyes narrowing slightly, silently assessing Agatha's condition. Not with judgement, but concern. There's no denying it - she’s high, and it's obvious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gives a small tight smile, clearly aware that Vision can tell. “It could be worse,” she says, her voice calm but a touch too airy. She doesn't sit down immediately, instead moving to stand near the foot of the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes soften immediately, a flicker of sympathy crosses his face as he takes in Agatha’s admission. He’s seen her hit rock bottom, and although she’s far from it now, he’s worried for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” he says gently. “It’s okay to admit you're not okay sometimes. We all have our moments.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a slow exhale, her fingers trembling slightly as she holds out the tin for him. “I wish I didn't in the first place,” she says, her voice heavy with something unspoken. “But… here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision doesn't immediately take it, he looks at the tin for a long moment, brow furrowing slightly before he finally takes it. He uncaps it and tension in his body releases when he finds green and not white in the container.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll drop it at your place,” he says softly, his voice almost a whisper now. “And don't worry about work. You need to focus on you right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a beat of silence between them, and then, as though he can't contain his concern any longer, Vision steps forward. He pulls Agatha into a gentle hug, his arms enveloping her with a quiet strength. It’s a rare gesture, especially from someone who is usually so reserved, but at this moment, it feels like the only thing he can do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffens at first, not expecting it, but then her body relaxes in the embrace, a silent surrender. She’s tired both emotionally and physically, and for once, it’s okay to lean on someone else, even if that someone isn't the person she wants to be leaning on. For a moment, she lets herself be held, her breath coming in soft steady waves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision pulls back after a few seconds, his hands lingering on her shoulders as he meets her gaze. “Take care of yourself, Agatha. This isn't weakness. I’m only a call away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flicker with something unspoken, gratitude perhaps, or maybe something deeper she hasn't fully processed yet. She nods, her throat tight but she manages a small, appreciative smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks Vision,” she says quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With one last look, he turns and exits the room, leaving Agatha standing there. The door clicks softly behind him, leaving Agatha alone with her thoughts, the quietness of the room feeling almost suffocating after the weight of the interaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhales slowly, sinking into the chair by Rio’s bedside. Rio’s eyes are still glossy, but focused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re high.” It’s a statement, but no judgement is in Rio’s words, just an observation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you have amnesia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckles softly, the sound thin and tired, as if it’s been a long time since she found anything to laugh about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes flicker to Rio’s, but instead of laughter, she still sees confusion in her eyebrows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're supposed to be sober, aren't you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile falters slightly at the question, but she’s not offended. She looks down at her hands, a soft sigh escaping from her lips. Her voice is low, almost regretful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I am,” she admits quietly. “At least California sober… you live through the shit I’ve been through… and I guess, sometimes it feels like the only thing that helps.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice is fragile, like she’s not used to saying these things out loud. She looks down at the floor, suddenly feeling very small.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A long pause stretches between them, Rio looks like she wants to ask more questions but refrains. She may have amnesia but she’s not blind. Yet. She can see the exhaustion written all over Agatha’s face - the slump in her shoulders, the distant look in her eyes, the way she hasn't quite stopped fidgeting since she sat down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can- I could use a break, from the deep questions,” Rio offers quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, a small grateful smile on her lips, and pulls out a tablet from her bag, placing it on the tray table in front of Rio. She flicks through the titles and lands on a cop show, and hits resume.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky started you on this show, the last time you were here,” Agatha says distantly. “Figured something familiar might help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't say anything as the episode begins, the trumpets of the theme song playing softly through the speakers. She doesn't remember much of what’s happening, but it tugs at a thread in her brain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shifts positions, wincing through the pain in her ribs, while Agatha lets her head fall back against the chair. She doesn't say anything else, just watches the episode in silence, letting it do the talking for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time the episode ‘Hostage Situation’ starts, Agatha’s eyes have fluttered shut, the tension in her features softening in her sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stays awake, watching the screen and stealing glances at the woman beside her, something tugging at the back of the memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she sees her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha but younger. Sharper jawline, a little more polished, but unmistakably Agatha. She waits in a chair by Boyle’s desk, as his ex-wife, dripping boredom and a glint of something devious in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t say anything, just keeps watching. Something clicks into place, like a scent you can't name but recognize anyways. In this case, she remembers the scent of pine in a room that’s not the woods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More than anything, she remembers the warmth she felt when she realized Agatha didn't need to get the cartridge, but wanted to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tries to sit up to get a better look at the screen but the pain laces through her shoulder. A nurse rushes in, tells her to lie back, but she doesn't forget the warmth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand twitches slightly where it rests on the blanket, her body heavy but her mind suddenly sharper. Agatha hadn't said a word about this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And somehow… that makes Rio smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glances at the sleeping form beside her and whispers, “You’re beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of a light snore is her only answer.</span>
</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Since Vision came and left, Agatha hasn’t left Rio’s side, no matter how painful the distant gaze in Rio’s eyes is. She told Rio she’ll never leave, and she isn’t going to back out now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There aren’t any new memories that have surfaced. Rio doesn’t spend the time making small talk, the haze of medication and the exhaustion of healing and several tests draining the little energy she already has. Agatha doesn’t mind though, she thinks if she fails to coax more memories, it’ll only hurt more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio’s not subject to become what she’s described herself as a lab rat, they spend their time watching Brooklyn 99. Agatha knows that they’ve passed the episode she guest starred in, even though she knows she fell asleep during it. Sometimes Rio falls asleep and Agatha keeps watching, Rio doesn’t mind though, nor has she mentioned Agatha’s appearance on screen. She’s glad though, she doesn’t want to have to explain why she’s no longer behind a camera.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sharp inhale tears through Rio’s throat a week after Vision’s visit, too loud in the stillness in the room. Her heart race is pacing - panic before thought, instinct before memory. She blinks, wide-eyed, chest rising and falling rapidly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jolts awake beside her, nearly falling out of the chair. Her hair is a mess, and exhaustion is visible all over her features..</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” she croaks, voice thick with sleep. “What- what’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't answer at first. Her eyes have a look of terror in them, as if she's seeing something just beyond Agatha’s face, something that’s not quite there. Her breath comes in short, erratic gasps, her chest rising and falling as if she’s trying to outrun something that’s chasing her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room is silent except for the faint beeping of the machines monitoring her vitals. But in Rio’s mind, it’s anything but.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The memory crashes over her like a wave, too fast and ice cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s not in the hospital bed anymore. Instead, she’s on a narrow path, surrounded by trees she knows too well, the ones she’s spent years caring for. She’s with her parents, except she’s not. Their shadows slowly walk away from her, past the ridge, towards the cabin hidden amongst the trees, and Rio’s entire body fills with a sense of peace with a dash of longing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re gone, aren’t they?” Rio asks, a tear slipping down her cheek. “My parents. That’s why they haven’t come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitches at the sound of Rio’s voice. It’s distant and uncharacteristically grounded. Agatha reaches for her instinctively, desperate need to anchor her to the present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry Rio,” Agatha murmurs softly,  voice a blend of tenderness and raw concern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio’s gaze stays unfocused, her eyes haunted as they search beyond Agatha, trying to preserve the image in her mind. She’s unsure if it’s a real memory, or just a dream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I remember… they were going on a trip,” she murmurs, her voice soft and distant, like she’s speaking to herself. “Australia… They were so excited. I told them I’d stay behind, take care of things here. Lilia tried to convince me to go, but I stayed. I was… I was in the Catskills when it happened. When I came back… they were gone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart tightens, a mixture of grief and fear coiling in her chest. She gently touches Rio’s hand, but Rio doesn’t seem to notice, her gaze still distant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been through so much,” she says quietly, her voice thick. “You’re strong, Rio. But it’s okay to let yourself feel. You don’t have to carry this alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head, her breath shaky, but it’s not panic that grips her now. It’s something else, something colder. Acceptance, maybe. Quiet and unsettling in its calmness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re gone,” she repeats, her voice firmer now. “They never blamed me. They loved me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightens at the finality in Rio’s words. There’s a weight to the calmness that scares her more than Rio’s previous turmoil ever could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sits there in the stillness, her hand hovering just above Rio’s, unsure if the touch would be welcomed or rejected. The quiet between them feels oppressive, one that speaks volumes. Rio’s acceptance, or what feels like acceptance, hangs heavy in the air; too heavy for Agatha to fully understand, but too obvious to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart aches as she watches Rio. She pieces together context clues from their previous conversation with Lilia and knows that this is in fact a memory resurfacing. She wonders how Rio can be so calm at this moment. The woman who had lost herself in her grief, turned herself in to Lady Death, how can she have accepted such a loss so completely?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The more Agatha watches Rio, the more she notices the subtle tremor in Rio’s hands, the way her chest rises and falls a little too fast. Rio’s silence isn’t peaceful, it’s strained, as if she’s holding something back. Her brow furrows just slightly, a small flicker of frustration in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s fighting, </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha realizes. Visions words echo in her mind. “</span>
<em>
<span>She’s got this way of silently fighting when it matters most</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sees it now, the subtle way Rio’s jaw clenches, the barely noticeable way her fingers twitch against the sheets as if she’s willing herself to move, to focus, to remember. The fight is present, silent but unmistakable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leans in closer, the room feeling suffocating with its silence, every second stretching into eternity. “Come back to me, Rio,” she says softly, but her voice trembles, betraying her fear. “I’m right here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words sound too fragile, too small in the face of everything Rio’s battling within herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio doesn’t answer - not with words. Her breathing is slower now, steadier, as if her mind has shifted slightly, like a stone being nudged back into place. There’s a flicker of recognition in her eyes, just enough for Agatha to hold onto.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…” Agatha whispers, her voice now a steady thread through the fog. She reaches out carefully, gently, her hand hovering just above Rio’s, waiting, almost afraid to touch her but desperate to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, at last, Rio’s hand moves, just slightly. A gesture. A sign of life beyond the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The softest exhale from Rio escapes her lips, barely a sound, but to Agatha, it’s everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay. I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart begins to steady as Rio’s fingers finally, slowly, curl around her own. It’s not much, but it’s enough. It’s enough to know that Rio is still with her, still present even if it’s in science.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha, for the first time in what feels like forever, lets herself believe that maybe, just maybe, everything will be okay.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The light outside has shifted slightly. Early morning now. The steady hum of the machines fills the room, a gentle, persistent reminder that time hasn’t stopped, even if it feels like it should have.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hasn’t spoken since the first few fragile moments. She lies still, her expression unreadable, gaze fixed on the ceiling. The fight is quieter now, less trembling, more focused, but Agatha can still feel it, pulsing beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft knock at the door breaks the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning,” the nurse says gently, entering with a clipboard and a kind, practiced smile. She’s in her mid-40’s, competent, brisk without being cold. “Just a quick check.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks at her, slow and groggy, her eyes sunken with exhaustion. She doesn’t respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifts from the chair beside the bed, straightening up but not letting go of Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse approaches the monitor, eyes flicking over Rio’s vitals as she continues. “Vitals are looking better today. That’s a good sign.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sets the clipboard down on the side table and picks up a small penlight. “Mind if I check your eyes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods slightly, but both Agatha and the nurse catch the subtle movement. The nurse leans in, flicking the light gently from side to side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Follow the light for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tries. Her eyes move, sluggish but compliant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” she murmurs. “Let’s try a few memory prompts. Don’t overthink it. Just say what comes to mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She picks up a photo card and turns it toward Rio. “Can you name this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks at it, lips parting. Her voice cracks. “House.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezes her hand, just slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another card.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Spider.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Next one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hammock.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse’s smile grows, surprised but pleased by the accuracy. “That’s right,” she says softly. “You’ve got a good memory in there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She holds up the next card. A photograph of a hiking trail lined with pine trees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes linger. Her lips part again, no answer this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches her carefully, her thumb gently brushing the back of Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse gives it a beat, then gently lowers the card. “That’s okay. You don’t have to get them all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But just as she moves to pick up another card, Rio’s voice rasps out. “Home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales. Her grip tightens slightly, anchoring them both. The nurse pauses, nodding slowly. “Yeah, that’s Westview.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes finally turn, slow and uncertain, toward Agatha, and although the recognition isn’t fully formed, something shifts - soft, fragile, real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be back in a little bit,” she says gently. “Press the call button if you need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the door clicks softly shut behind her, the quiet that follows feels different, no longer hollow but suspended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans in, her voice low, careful not to scare off whatever fragile tether just formed. “You’re doing so good, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks slowly, still staring at her. Her brows pinch faintly, like she’s trying to place a dream she can almost remember.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brushes a strand of hair from Rio’s cheek, fingers trembling just slightly. “You know me, don’t you? Somewhere in there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t answer. But her eyes don’t leave Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lingers by the bedside, fingers curled around the edge of Rio’s blanket, reluctant to let go. She hasn’t left the hospital in days, she’s barely let herself do more than run on caffeine and sheer stubbornness, but something about the way Rio is looking at her now makes her hesitate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s recognition there. Not full, not solid, but something flickering just beneath the surface, like a name caught on the tip of the tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go home,” Rio murmurs, voice hoarse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha startles, barely hiding her surprise. “Are you kicking me out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips twitch - barely a smirk, but it’s there. “You smell like a hospital, and stale weed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs. “That’s rich coming from someone who’s been on death’s doorstep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly, and yet you’re worse. Go home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a breathy laugh, the kind that sounds too much like relief. “Fine, but only because you’re bullying me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flutter, heavy but amused. “Take a real shower, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifts a hand in mock surrender but agrees. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The room settles into a softer silence after Agatha finally leaves, the door clicking shut behind her. Rio stares up at the ceiling, the fluorescent lights overhead dimmed, casting pale blue shadows across the tile. The nurse has already been in and out, leaving her a fresh glass of water and another round of meds she only half remembers being injected into her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She drifts in and out, not quite dreaming, not quite resting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Some time passes, she’s not sure how much, before she realizes Agatha left a sweatshirt on the chair she was sitting in. it’s thrown hastily over the back. Deep purple, soft and worn, the collar slightly frayed. When she reaches for it, slow and cautious, her fingers tremble. She pulls it into her lap, then up to her face, and inhales.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It smells like lavender. Like warmth. Like Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath hitches. It’s not just the fabric or the lingering traces of the outside world, it’s her. There’s a bite of vanilla mixed into a faint medicinal note from the hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closes her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then it lands. A flash of memory, brief and sharp. It’s loud, it’s tense. She remembers irritation through her body as she recalls saying ‘wilderness demon spawn.’</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost laughs, a bitter sound that catches in her throat. The words come back to her, sharp as ever. </span>
<em>
<span>Wilderness demon spawn</span>
</em>
<span>. She had said it to downplay Nicky calling her a badass. A joke to shrink from the weight of being seen. The irony stings now, having sent Agatha away to shower, sent her away at all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The scent of lavender and vanilla wraps around her, both soothing and unnerving at the same time. She tries to separate herself from the warmth, from the memories of the tension in the room that escalated shortly after, but the memory of the fight makes it difficult to remain distant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The voices rushe back, as vivid and sharp as if it happened only moments ago. Nicky’s, sharp and jagged, spewing cruel words at his mother through his frustration. </span>
<em>
<span>“You’re a fucking coward… You found a new stage, a cleaner one and slapped a lab coat over the hot mess you already were… You made saving me your redemption arc.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The sting of his words makes her throat tighten. Agatha’s hurt yet firm reply cuts through the tension, filled in with something that feels both defensive and heartbreakingly raw. “</span>
<em>
<span>You needed a heart Nicky! … You think I’m ashamed of you? … You wouldn’t have lived past six if I hadn’t walked away from everything…</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio remembers feeling helpless during the argument taking place a few feet away from her. The weight of their pain made the penthouse feel too small. She hadn't meant to be the center of it, but she was. The fight may not have been about her, but it started with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembers stepping in, calming them both down. “</span>
<em>
<span>I’m not your battleground</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembers everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky on the ridge’s edge, the rope being tied too hastily. The panic in Nicky’s eyes. Waking up in an unfamiliar place with Agatha by her bedside. “</span>
<em>
<span>You saved someone important to me.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The sweatshirt tightens in her grip as she curls into it, burning her face against the worn fabric. The scent simultaneously overwhelms her and brings her comfort. Within the threads of cotton, it smells like safety, and also longing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It hurts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath turns ragged. She doesn’t know if it’s the memories or the sharp, relentless ache in her ribs, but her chest clenches, a sob trapped beneath the surface. Her heart pounds too hard, too fast. The monitor beside her spikes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She winces, blinking back tears that blur the sterile ceiling lights. Panic churns in her gut, her body tightening as if bracing for another fall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door swings open. A nurse hurries in, her voice gentle but firm. “Hey- hey, easy. You’re safe, but your vitals are climbing. Let’s get you settled, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head once, trying to speak, but her voice catches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deep breaths, sweetheart. You’re okay,” the nurse soothes, already preparing the mild sedative. “Just something to help you rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t resist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The warmth spreads through her arm first, then seeps into her chest, numbing the worst of it. Her lashes flutter, the world softening at the edges. Just before the dark pulls her under, she thinks she hears a door click open. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio wakes again, the room is quieter. Dim. A warm weight rests over her chest - her sweatshirt. Not hers, but Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there at the edge of the room, in the low light, Agatha sits in the armchair beside her, eyes on her like she never left. </span>

<p>
<span>Agatha looks clean. It’s the first thing Rio notices when she takes in her appearance, hair still damp from the shower Rio forced her to take, skin pink at the edges from scrubbing away the exhaustion. But it’s the hoodie that breaks her. Agatha’s wearing the faded Westview National Park sweatshirt, her sweatshirt she realizes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something about it makes her breath catch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You came back,” Rio whispers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offers a smile that’s tired and too soft to be casual. “I’d never leave you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grip tightens around the blankets, fingers trembling. “You look… clean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raises a brow, a hint of a smirk twitching at the corner of her mouth. “That’s what happens when someone guilts you into showering.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a broken laugh that turns into a shaky breath. “Sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be.” Agatha’s eyes arm. “I needed it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They fall quiet again, but it’s different now. The silence isn’t suffocating. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio studies her, like really studies her. “You’re wearing my hoodie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, almost sheepish. “You took mine, I got cold.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances down to the purple cotton above her blanket. It doesn’t have a zipper and she can’t pull it over her head yet, but it feels like a hug nonetheless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guess we’re even,” she murmurs, voice still rasping from sedation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moves closer, careful not to crowd her. “I think I got the better deal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t argue. She watches Agatha settle into the chair beside her, legs crossed like she’s trying not to seem too eager. There’s something in her eyes, guilt maybe or fear, but under it all, relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts slightly, wincing, but she doesn’t let go of the warmth that’s cocooned around her. “Where’s the kid?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath catches. “Uhm, at a friend’s place I think, or at school. Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to see him.” Rio’s voice is firm, almost commanding, but carries a rasp from sleep. The words land with the weight in the air between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinks, taken aback by the sudden shift in Rio’s tone. “Are you sure? You’ve just woken up, Rio. I mean… you’ve been through a lot-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now,” she interrupts, her eyes locking with Agatha’s. The steady gaze is clear, unflinching. There’s no room for argument in the way she sees it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitates, searching Rio’s face. There’s something different in her demeanor - something that hints at a deeper shift, but she can’t quite place it. Maybe it’s the aftereffects of the sedation, or maybe Rio’s just being stubborn. But there’s no denying the intensity in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallows, looking down at her phone. She taps the screen slowly, dialing Nicky’s number with a quiet sigh. The room feels a little too small now, the weight of the moment thick in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The phone rings once, twice, before Nicky’s voice comes through the line. “Hey mama, what’s up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi Nicky,” she says softly, glancing back at Rio, who’s still locked in place, her gaze distant, but not unkind. “I need you to come to the hospital. Rio wants to see you.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The line goes quiet for a beat. “Wait what? Is she okay? Is everything alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightens and she forces herself to speak without hesitation. “She’s awake, Nicky. She’s been asking for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause, then a slow exhale from Nicky. “I’m on my way. I’ll be there soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ends the call and places the phone down gently, her eyes lingering on Rio. There’s a strange quiet in the room now, the buzz of the hospital machine almost too loud in the silence. Rio’s fingers are still gripping the edge of her blanket, but she doesn’t look at Agatha. Instead, her gaze is fixed somewhere beyond the window, the pale light from the outside catching the shadows on her face. She knows she’s in the city, she just wonders if there will be a time she’ll be able to return to her home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Moments later, the door creaks open and Nicky tentatively walks through. His eyes immediately find Agatha, then flicker to Rio, who’s still staring out the window, her body unmoving except for the faintest rise and fall of her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky hesitates for a second, then steps fully into the room, his hands shoved deep in the pockets of his NYU hoodie. He looks a little disheveled, like he rushed here, but the concern in his eyes is noticeable. His voice comes out in a careful murmur, as if testing the waters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the sound of her name, Rio’s head shifts, her gaze slowly moving from the window to land on him. Her expression is hard to read - too many layers, too many things left unsaid. But there’s a quiet intensity in the way she holds herself as if she’s trying to pull the world back together inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, in a sudden shift of energy, Rio smirks slightly and without missing a beat says in Spanish, ¿Por qué no me dijiste que tu mamá es una actriz sexy?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her words hang in the air, sharp and unexpected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s head jerks toward her, his brow furrowed in confusion. “What?” he asks, his voice slightly too loud, the confusion clear in his eyes. He looks at Agatha for clarification, but she’s frozen. Agatha’s eyes snap to Rio, her face pale, the weight of the moment suddenly heady. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky notices the shift in Agatha, her entire body tense, her eyes wide with something unspoken. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t respond right away. She just blinks, processing what Rio has just said. She opens her mouth to speak, but it’s like she’s too stunned to find the right words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio says, smirk still slightly tugging at her lips. “Gatorade.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not a question, but a request. One that doesn’t slip past Agatha’s mind. She lets out a huff and leaves the room without another word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky watches Agatha go, confusion still written all over his face. He turns back to Rio, his eyes narrowing as he processes the strange, almost playful atmosphere that has shifted in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You should really listen to your mom, kid,” she says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky blinks, still trying to piece together what’s happening. His gaze flicks from Agatha’s retreating figure to Rio, lying in bed underneath her mother’s hoodie, pale, but alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s that supposed to mean?” he asks, the frustration in his voice coming through more clearly than he intends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means that she’s your mother and she loves you. What you said to her was out of line.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We already resolved that,” he says, his shoulders relaxing as he realizes Rio remembers the fight. The tension in his posture starts to ease, but there’s still something in his eyes - a flicker of guilt, maybe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes but </span>
<em>
<span>we </span>
</em>
<span>didn’t,” Rio says, her voice softer now, but firm, the weight of her words grounding the room. “None of this is your fault kid. Well, except for not reading the signs. That ridge is dangerous. But I’m the one who didn’t tie the knot properly, and I’m the one who didn’t tell either of you two how sick I was. It’s not your burden to carry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky blinks, surprised by the sudden turn in the conversation. The words sink into him, and for the first time in what feels like forever, his shoulders drop a little. There’s a heaviness that’s been hovering over him, that guilt, that fear of things unraveling. But hearing Rio speak with such calm clarity makes something in him ease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I… I didn’t know,” he admits, his voice quieter now. “I won’t use Westview for my film-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t use Lady Death in your film,” she corrects. “You can still use Westview, that place may be small but there's magic in the town that your mom helped create.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nods, still processing Rio’s words, his mind racing in a thousand different directions. The tension in his shoulders eases slightly, though the weight of the situation is far from gone. He wasn’t sure what he expected, but Rio’s calmness, her honesty, it’s like a blanket over a fire, smothering all the doubt he’s been holding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll figure something else out,” he says as Agatha re-enters the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Call Wanda and Jen and ask them about our college spring break, it’s a movie waiting to happen,” Agatha says, placing the bottle of Gatorade next to Rio’s bedside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looks at Agatha, still processing the shift in conversation. Her suggestion takes him by surprise, but it’s the same quick wit and easy confidence he’s grown accustomed to. Agatha’s always been about seeing the bigger picture, making the most out of every situation - even the unexpected ones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He glances down at Rio, who’s now watching Agatha with an unreadable expression, her fingers still loosely gripping the edge of the sweatshirt. Rio doesn’t say anything, but there’s something in the way she’s watching the exchange - something unspoken between her and Agatha, an understanding that Nicky can’t quite grasp yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m serious Nicky,” Agatha continues, her voice lighter now, less weighed down by heavy moments that came before. “The spring break trip was a disaster, but there’s a story there. You know, the chaos, the mistakes, the friendships. You can tell it in a way that feels real.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky hesitates for a moment, considering the idea. There’s a spark of something in him now, something that flickers with possibility. A different direction, yes, but maybe one that brings more of what he’s been looking for all along. Something raw, something genuine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright alright,” he says, shaking his head with a small grin. “I’ll call Wanda and Jen, see what I can dig up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles, then sits down next to Rio again, her fingers brushing the edge of the bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now scram kid, I’m still pretty sick and I don’t want you getting whatever this is, if I remember correctly you’re still immunocompromised,” Rio says gently with a soft smile on her face. “Go, I’ll be fine, enjoy school. I can’t wait to see what you come up with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky pauses, his phone halfway to his ear, a flicker of hesitation as he looks at Rio. She doesn’t look at him with that same exhausted fragile gaze as before. There’s something more at ease in her demeanor, a quiet strength that makes him nod without a word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, I’m glad you’re feeling better,” he sighs. He glances at Agatha, who gives him a nod of approval, and then he turns to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as the door clicks shut, Agatha can’t contain her bewilderment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You remember everything?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winces, the sheer force of Agatha’s voice ringing in her ears and flaring pain across her battered ribs. She squeezes her eyes shut, biting back a groan.. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha recoils, horror-struck. “Shit- sorry, sorry,” she blurts out, voice dropping to a frantic whisper. She hovers uselessly, looking ready to either sprint for a doctor or start sobbing on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind spins - had she imagined it? Had she dreamed of Rio talking, asking for Gatorade, knowing her? Was she losing it after two straight weeks of living in hospital chairs? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slowly blinks up at her, looking utterly bewildered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“... Who are you?” she rasps, voice scratch and raw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stares at her, ice flooding her veins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t know me?” she whispers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowns weakly, like she’s working very hard to solve a complicated math problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you my… accountant?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha makes a helpless, strangled noise. “No?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow furrows deeper. “Landlord?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? No!” Agatha clutches the sides of her head. “Jesus Christ-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure?” Rio croaks, deadly serious. “You’ve got the vibe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks like she might actually vomit. She whirls toward the door like she’s about to go grab the nearest nurse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait,” Rio murmurs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha freezes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squints up at her with exaggerated effort, pointing a trembling finger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“... Mom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha almost collapses on the spot. “No!” she wheezes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure?” Rio rasps again. “You’re real bossy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha puts both her hands on her knees, bending down like she’s trying not to pass out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets the silence stretch unbearably long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait,” she says after a beat, slurring just enough to sound delirious, “is this… where am I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drags both her hands down her face in open despair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her for a long moment, then lifts her good hand in a tiny, pitiful thumb-up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gotcha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head snaps up. “You little-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gives a weak, breathless huff of laughter, instantly grimacing in pain and clutching her ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s panic returns full-force. “Hey- hey, easy, easy!” She darts to her side, gently steadying her. “God, Rio, don’t- don’t hurt yourself-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re the one yelling,” Rio wheezes, grinning like a menace even through the obvious pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stares at her, half furious, half ready to cry, half ready to kiss her senseless (and maybe kill her afterward).</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I take back what I said, you are an insufferable asshole,” Agatha hisses, adjusting Rio’s pillows with furious gentleness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re gullible,” Rio counters, breathless but smug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slumps down into the chair, staring at the ceiling like she’s begging for divine patience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sit like that for a few moments, Rio’s smile slowly fading as exhaustion drags at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha asks, voice much softer. “But… you do remember? Some of it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s amusement ebbs into something quiet, heavier. She nods faintly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bits and pieces,” she murmurs. “Not… everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans forward instinctively, desperate to understand. “What do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts slightly, the movement cautious and stiff with pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you stayed,” she whispers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat tightens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know… you fought for me,” Rio says, a little more brokenly. “Even when I couldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallows, wincing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I know, I’m not alone,” she finishes, almost inaudible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha presses a hand over her heart, like she’s trying to hold herself together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not even close,” she says thickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closes her eyes for a moment, a shaky breath rattling in her lungs. When she opens them again, she’s still smiling - a little tired, a little mischievous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“... Wait,” she says weakly. “Who’s Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands drop from her face like a dead weight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stares at Rio, horror dawning all over again. “You- you don’t know-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that my… dog?” Rio croaks, all wide innocent eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dog?!” Agatha squeaks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She half-rises from the chair, panic flooding back in full force. “No, no, no, no - he was just here- you asked for him, you-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her quietly, expression blank.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice climbs into near-hysteria. “Jesus Christ, I let him leave, I let him leave, what if-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifts her good hand with a heroic effort, poking her weakly in the thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax,” she says, utterly deadpan. “Couldn’t help myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stares at her, mouth open, betrayal written across every inch of her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin cracks wider, though she’s clearly fighting not to cough from the effort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re evil,” Agatha says in disbelief, sinking back down in the chair like her strings have been cut. “You’re a demon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just smiles smugly, closing her eyes and sinking deeper into the pillows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, I told you, ‘wilderness demon spawn,’ I wasn’t just talking about my good looks. Must be why you like me,” she teases.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opens her mouth, then closes it again fast, cheeks flushing hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For once, she has absolutely nothing to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio for the first time in weeks, falls into an easy, exhausted sleep with a tiny, victorious smirk on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stares at Rio’s sleeping face, still too stunned to move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She presses both palms into her jeans, trying to physically ground herself, but her heart is still hammering in her chest like she just survived a plane crash.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s mouthing silence, incredulous curses to herself when the door swings open again with a sharp click.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A nurse steps in, holding a clipboard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” she chirps brightly, before immediately blinking at AGatha’s expression. “Uh. Everything okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks up, stricken, hands still frozen mid-air like she’s been caught committing a crime.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She-” Agatha gestures wildly at Rio, words completely failing her. “She… punked me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse’s eyebrows shoot up. She glances at the heart monitor still calmly beeping behind rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“... I’m sorry?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scrubs her hands through her hair, half laughing, half sobbing. “She made me think my is her dog.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse suppresses a smile, glancing back at Rio’s peacefully sleeping form.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well that’s a good sign,” she says, writing something down on the clipboard. “Means her memory’s fine, and her sense of humor’s intact.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sense of humor,” Agatha repeats hollowly, slumping even lower in the chair. “Yeah. Terrifying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse finishes her checks, gives Agatha an encouraging pat on the shoulder, and slips back out with a quiet click of the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stays behind,still sunk deep in the chair. Her hands hang limply over the armrests, her heart rate finally slowing - through she’s pretty sure her pride has taken irreparable damage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glances at Rio, who’s breathing slow and steady now, face softened by sleep. The smugness is gone,but Agatha can still see the ghost of it tucked into the corners of her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs a quiet, disbelieving laugh, draggina a hdn down her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re insufferable,” she mutters under her breath. “Absolutely insufferable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leans back against the chair, staring up at the ceiling like maybe it holds the answers she needs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you're lucky you’re cute,” she adds, voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s said to the air, to the empty room, to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Rio doesn’t hear it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha’s not ready to say it to her, not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe not for a long while.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She settles deeper into the chair, exhaustion creeping in, but a small, unshakable smile tugs at the corner of her mouth. The kind that no amount of fear, or pride, or common sense can fully erase. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The next few weeks blur in a haze of medical visits and tests, and by the time Rio finally hears the words ‘discharge,’ she’s itching to finally breathe fresh air. The doctors talk in careful terms, balancing optimism with caution caution - her ribs have finally healed, her vitals are stable and the worst of the pneumonia has passed, but the price of survival has been steep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Weeks of bedrest and inactivity have robbed Rio of her strength. Her muscles feel foreign, stiff and uncooperative, like they forgot how to belong to her. And worse, there are holes in her memory - small, stupid things that Rio can’t just seem to grab onto. She knows the broad strokes: what happened, who helped her, where she is. But it’s the little things that made Rio, Rio that are still beyond her reach. It scares her more than she’ll ever admit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the nurse wheels her to the exit with a cane in tow, Rio doesn’t argue, even though she hates it. Standing too long makes her dizzy. Walking more than a few steps drains her completely. She’s never known weakness like this - never needed help to simply exist. But now, as she’s ushered toward the open car door where Agatha waits, she can’t deny how fragile she feels.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha helps buckle her into her black SUV, then closes the door gently. She moves around to the driver’s seat with a steady practiced calm. She’s been like that ever since Rio’s memory returned - there, unwavering, but never intrusive. It makes Rio feel safe in ways she doesn’t have the words for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive through the city is quiet and short.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Through the tinted windows, Rio watches the world pass in strange detachment. The garage gates recognize Agatha’s car, opening in near silence. Her reflection glances back at her from the glass - thinner, paler, her eyes followed by exhaustion. She barely recognizes herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha parks in her reserved space, then helps Rio out of the car. “Elevator’s just there,” she says gently, breaking the silence. “No stairs, I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I remember,” she answers automatically, but then pauses. She does remember, doesn’t she? The private elevator, the penthouse… She's been here before. Yet as they move forward, a prickling unease curls at the back of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every step toward the elevator is a battle. The plush interior of the private lift offers no comfort as the gravity presses down on her like a weight. She leans into the polished chrome wall as it ascends, breathing shallowly. Agatha keeps a hand at her back, silent and steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator doors open directly into Agatha’s penthouse. The familiar sight of dark wood floors and airy light cabinets makes Rio’s breath catch for a moment - then twist. She </span>
<em>
<span>knows</span>
</em>
<span> this space… but it feels like a photograph she’s seen once and tried to memorize.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Home, but not home. Not her home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s knees wobble the moment she steps forward. Agatha catches her elbow instinctively. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s get you to the couch,” she says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve got it,” Rio mutters out of habit, but the protest is weak. She’s too tired to pretend.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The oversized leather couch welcomes her like an old friend she can’t quite recognize. As she sinks into it, Rio feels every inch of her weakness, every ounce of her body’s betrayal. Technically, she’s healed - but recovery is its own beast, gnashing and slow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kneels beside her, checking her pulse the way she’s been taught by too many emergencies. “You’re okay,” she murmurs. “Just tired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exhausted,” Rio admits. She lets her head rest against the back of the couch. “I feel like I’ve run a marathon with my arms tied behind my back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You kind of have.” Agatah smiles faintly. “Without the dramatic finish line.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The penthouse is calm. A soft hum of music from hidden speakers fills the space. A blanket sits folded neatly on the ottoman. A steaming cup of ginger tea waits on the coffee table. A potted plant Rio doesn’t remember is tucked near the window. Most importantly, no trace of her blood from her collapse is evident.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You cleaned,” she murmurs, the observation half-surprised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Vision made me.” Agatha’s smile is wry. “Said it’d be better for you to come back to a clean place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” she mumbles, guilt knotting in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brushes her hand over Rio’s good shoulder and sits down beside her, placing the cane by the armrest. “Don’t be. It’s done, and you’re here now. That’s all that matters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her for a moment, trying to find her balance in the space between them. Gratitude wells up painfully - gratitude, and something heavier, something that almost feels like grief for the pieces of herself she can’t seem to gather back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t even know what to say anymore,” she mutters instead, a faint chuckle escaping her lips, though it’s weary. “I think I ran out of things to feel guilty about weeks ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s laugh is soft, a low hum of amusement.  “You really do know how to pile it on yourself, don’t you?” she teases though her voice is gentle. “You’ve got nothing to apologize for. Not to me. Not for anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks at her, really looks, and something sharp catches in her chest. The emotion in Agatha’s face is clear, open, without judgement. It disarms her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still,” Rio says, her voice steadying, “I’m sorry for the chaos. For everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods but doesn’t push the issue. “You can make it up to me by resting. That’s all you need to be doing right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet between them stretches comfortably. Rio leans back into the couch, closing her eyes for a moment. Her body feels heavy with exhaustion, but the act of simply being here, in this space, with Agatha’s calm presence beside her, makes it feel a little less suffocating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate feeling so weak,” Rio admits, the vulnerability slipping out before she can stop it. She didn’t even realize how much of it she was carrying - how much it was gnawing at her until now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifts closer, her fingers brushing Rio’s hand with a tenderness that almost makes Rio flinch, not from discomfort, but from the unfamiliarity of it all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not weak,” she says softly, her voice low and reassuring. “You’re recovering. That takes strength, too. Maybe more than anything else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows the lump in her throat, unwilling to let herself be consumed by the weight of those words. It feels too close to the edge of something she’s not ready to face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be fine,” she murmurs instead, more to herself than Agatha. “Just need some time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take all the time you need,” Agatha replies. “You’ve got it. You’re not alone in this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio allows herself to believe that - just for a moment. The idea of being less alone, of someone standing beside her while she heals, feels like a weight she never expected to welcome. But it’s there, gently wrapping around her like the blanket Agatha draped across her lap earlier.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She must drift off at some point, because the next thing Rio notices is the smell of something warm and savory winding through the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a long moment, she lies still on the couch, listening. There’s the clatter of a pan being set on the stove, the low murmur of a voice, Agahta’s, humming to herself, a song Rio can’t place. She frowns slightly, annoyed at the gap in her mind. The song is familiar to her, but she can’t name it for the life of her. She sits for another few minutes, trying to figure out the artist, trying to figure out just </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> she knows that song.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few moments of nothing, she eventually pushes herself upright and breaths through the sudden wave of dizziness. Her body aches like it’s been hollowed out and stitched back together wrong. Even simply readjusting her position feels like a victory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha notices the movement almost immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re up,” she says, her voice warm. She steps out from behind the kitsch island, a towel slung over her shoulder. “I was going to wake you in a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks at her, disoriented for a second longer than she cares to admit. “What time is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Almost four,” Agatha answers. She crosses the room and crouches beside the couch again, studying Rio’s face. “How are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I got hit by a truck. Twice,” Rio mutters, managing a weak smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles back but doesn’t laugh, like she’s reading the undercurrent beneath the joke. “Better than this morning?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods slowly. “Yeah. A little.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s true, even if her mind feels fogged over. She’s glad to be out of the hospital, but the reality of just how hard it is to do mundane things hits her harder than Rio expects.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glances past Agatha at the kitchen again, at the neat counter and the gleaming appliances. There are details she remembers - the cool marble of the island, the strange, modern espresso machine - but the others feel alien. The potted basil plant by the sink, the purple dish towel draped over the oven handle.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Were those always there?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m making something simple,” Agatha says, standing. “Soup and grilled cheese. You up for eating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s stomach growls before she can answer. She huffs a breath, surprised by the rush of hunger. “I guess so.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grins and disappears back into the kitchen. Rio watches her work - easy, confident, like she’s done this a thousand times. She wonders why Agatha’s the one cooking, it’s obvious she comes from money and she figured she’d hired someone to do all of this for her, but she stays silent. If she asks about Agatha’s life, then she’ll return the same questions, some of which Rio isn’t ready to face just yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shifts to the edge of the couch, gripping her cane loosely. Just standing will be a process. Everything feels heavier than it should.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to move,” Agatha calls without looking up. “I’ll bring it to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can make it to the table,” Rio says stubbornly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It takes longer than it should, but Rio makes it across the living room and into the kitchen nook, lowering herself carefully into a chair. Pride wars with exhaustion in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slides a plate and bowl in front of her a few minutes later. The soup steams invitingly; the sandwich is perfectly golden. Rio’s stomach growls again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t poison it,” Agatha teases gently. “Promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks tiredly. “Wouldn’t be the worst way to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They eat in companionable silence for a while. Rio takes small bites, savoring the food. Her hands still tremble if she moves too quickly. Another betrayal. Another reminder of how much ground she still has to cover.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Halfway through the meal, she catches Agatha watching her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio asks, wiping her mouth with her free hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, but there’s a tenderness in her eyes that twists something in Rio’s gut.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just glad you’re here,” she says simply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ducks her head, the sudden emotion too big to look at directly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They finish eating slowly. Rio manages most of the food, her appetite waking up after weeks of being smothered by hospital smells and sterile walls. Agatha clears the plates without asking, like she knows Rio would want to help but can’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Agatha’s finished with the dishes and Rio makes her way back over to the couch, Rio feels marginally stronger, but restless from too much lying around. The aches in her body are like bruises she can’t see, but it’s the sticky, clammy feeling of hospital residue still clinging to her skin that finally pushes her to speak up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think… I want to take a bath,” Rio says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks up from the book she’s been pretending to read. Concern flickers across her face before she schools it into something softer. “Are you sure you’re up for it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need to get the smell off of me,” Rio says, almost apologetically. Her voice is low. “I’ll be careful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitates, like she wants to offer help, but she just nods instead. “I’ll set it up for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She disappears into her bathroom. Rio hears the splash of water running, the soft thumb of towels being pulled from a shelf. The normalcy of it steadies her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A few moments later, she comes back and guides Rio gently through her bedroom straight to the master bath. It’s warm, the scent of lavender and something faintly citrus lingering in the steam. Agatha moves carefully, gently helping Rio sit down on the closed toilet seat. The room tilts a little around her, but Rio clamps down on the nausea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s get you out of these,” Agatha murmurs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands are careful, reverent even, as she helps ease Rio’s arm out of the sling. There’s a tenderness to it that makes Rio’s throat tighten. She doesn’t protest, doesn’t joke, just watches as Agatha slowly peels the fabric away, exposing her shoulder and ribs. The sling catches once, and Rio winces - more from the act of being seen than the physical pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s the first time she’s worn real clothes since the hospital, some soft cotton thing Agatha had helped her into earlier that morning. They felt too personal now. She flinches when Agatha gently lifts the shirt over her head, careful not to jar her injured arm. Her sweatpants follow, pooling uselessly around her ankles before Agatha crouches to tug them away. There’s a silence that swells between them, heavy and close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio sees herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The mirror doesn’t lie. It never has. But it’s crueler now - cold and clinical in the quiet light of the bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her ribs are sharper than memory allows. Not just bruised, but wrong. Like her body’s been scooped hollow and patched together with wax paper and twine. Her abdomen is a patchwork of fading yellow and purple. Her collarbone is just like a crooked shelf. The sling has left an angry mark near her neck, and the skin around her dislocated shoulder is still swollen and tight. Her thighs, once strong from hiking the trails daily, look limp and unfamiliar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha says something - gentle, soothing - but Rio doesn’t hear it. Her vision tunnels. She pushes Agatha away with trembling hands, panic spiking hot and fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Out,” she rasps. “Please- just- out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face twists with worry, but she listens. She backs away immediately, giving Rio space, her hand lingering on the doorframe before she steps out and pulls the door closed behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The click of the latch sounds too loud in the small room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio struggles to stand and stumbles over to the vanity, gripping the edge of the sink, staring at the reflection she barely recognizes. Her chest heaves. The bruises. The emptiness in her head where small memories should be. How could she be missing so much? How could she have let herself fall apart like this without even knowing it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tub behind her steams gently, an invitation she can’t ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without thinking, sheer determination brings her over to the edge of the bathtub. The water is scalding hot, burning against her raw skin, but she sinks down anyways, pulling her knees to her chest.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Memories claw at her; sharp flashes of pain, the taste of blood, Nicky’s horrified face over the ridge’s edge, the beeping of machines, a woman’s voice, Lilia’s maybe, sobbing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She can’t hold them back. She can’t push them away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Desperate, Rio slides under the water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The heat of the bathwater blurs the world around her. It should sting her bruises, but Rio barely notices. She curls tighter into herself, the water rising around her face, silencing the rapid, ugly noise of her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t want to surface. She doesn’t want to see the broken stranger staring back at her in the mirror. She doesn’t want to be a burden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lungs scream, her ribs stab inward like sharpened knives, but she stays under, letting the small wave of the water wash away the rough edges of Rio’s dignity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A muffled shout tears through the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A hand plunges into the bath, seizing her by the good shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In a rush of splashing and panic, Rio’s yanked upward into the cold, gasping air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She chokes violently, her body wracked with spasms she can’t control. Agatha’s arms lock around her, half-dragging, half-cradling her upright against the cool ceramic of the tub.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio! God, breathe- come on, breathe for me,” Agatha begs, voice cracking raw with fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio is yanked up into the cold air. She coughs violently, water pouring from her mouth, her entire body spasming uncontrollably. Pain lances through her ribs, bright and jagged. Her vision spots white. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulls her upright in the rub, cradling her fiercely, one hand behind her head to keep her from sagging under again. Her other hand splays wide against Rio’s back, steadying her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay,” Agatha breathes, frantic and close, their foreheads almost touching. “You’re okay. I’ve got you. Just breathe, sweetheart. Just breathe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio coughs again, thin, rasping, her eyes wide locking onto Agatha’s, wild with confusion and shame.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t let go. She kneels in the tub herself now, soaked to the knees, holding Rio upright with a strength she doesn’t know she has.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bathroom spins around them, not with steam and panic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smooths Rio’s soaked hair away from her face, whispering, over and over, a desperate mantra: “You’re safe. You’re safe. You’re safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio trembles against her, too weak to pull away. Water trickles from her skin, pooling at the bottom of the tub, but Agatha doesn’t seem to notice. She just stays, anchoring her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio’s gasps finally slow,  Agatha shifts them slightly, cradling her more securely. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s get you cleaned up,” she whispers, voice thick with emotion. “I’ll be quick, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just closes her eyes, shame washing through her stronger than the bathwater ever could. She didn’t want to die, she just wanted to not feel pain, even for a moment, but she can’t say that. She refuses to show weakness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moves carefully, reverently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She soaks a soft cloth in the warm water, wrings it out with steady hands, and sweeps it gently across Rio’s arms and shoulders, careful not to jostle her still healing shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She treats her like she’s whole, like she’s not broken at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flinches, not from pain, but from the unbearable kindness of it. Agath just keeps murmuring - low, steady assurances under her breath, like a prayer meant only for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re alright. I’m here. You’re safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she’s finished, Agatha sets the cloth aside and reaches for a towel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she breathes. “Let’s get you out of there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still mute, Rio lets her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slides one arm behind Rio’s back and another beneath her knees, lifting her with careful, shivering, strength. Rio folds into her without protest, shivering despite the lingering steam.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wraps her in a thick towel immediately, tucking it tightly around her small frame, and grabs another for Rio’s dripping hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did good,” she murmurs, voice breaking a little as she presses her forehead briefly against Rio’s temple. Just for a second, she tells herself, just to prove to herself that Rio’s real and alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She brings Rio over to the bed and eases her gently onto her left side. Moving quickly across the room, she finds an oversized sleep shirt and a pair of soft sweatpants. A knot of worry tightens in her chest when Rio doesn’t even flinch as she maneuvers the shirt over her injured shoulder. But at last, Rio is dressed again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Carefully, Agatha helps her settle into the sheets, the soft scent of lavender wrapping around them like a familiar hand. She sits at the edge of the bed, running a towel through Rio’s damp hair, her movements slow and methodical, careful not to pull or tug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lies there, trembling faintly, silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha keeps her touch feather-light, whispering again, voice almost breaking. “You’re safe, sweetheart. I’ve got you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sets the damp towel aside and smooths the edge of the blanket up over Rio’s shoulders. For a moment, she just sits there, her hand resting lightly against Rio’s good arm, not pressing, just a quiet reassurance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The city hums outside the windows, muted by the thick glass. Somewhere in the distance, a siren wails and fades. But here, in this room, there’s only stillness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breathing slows, little by little. The trembling in her fingers eases. Her face turns slightly toward Agatha’s hand in her sleep, a soft, unguarded movement that feels like the loosening of a knot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stays a little while longer, just watching her - making sure she’s real, that she’s still breathing, that she’s safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only when Rio’s face smooths into something close to peace does Agatha rise, moving silently to the chair across the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She settles in, pulling a knit throw over herself. Her eyes stay on Rio, tracing the slow rise and fall of her chest, until the rhythm pulls her into sleep too.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The morning slips in quiet and gray, heavy with things unsaid.</p><p>Agatha sits at the kitchen table, her coffee going cold between her hands. She watches her bedroom door with a sick knot coiled low in her gut.</p><p>Memories of the previous night replay in her head; the prolonged silence, the panic of seeing Rio submerged underwater, the way Rio refused to look her in the eye afterwards.</p><p>
<em>Had she fallen? Or was that on purpose? I shouldn’t have left her alone. No- she asked for it. Did she want to die?</em>
</p><p>Agatha pushes away that last question, she’s not sure she’s ready to hear the answer, but the panic hasn’t left her body since entering her bathroom. </p><p>When Rio finally emerges, she’s a ghost of herself - hunched over slightly, careful, her bare feet making no sound against the floor.</p><p>Her good arm braces against the wall as she moves, her breathes tight and shallow from the effort.</p><p>Agatha notes the lack of cane and sling, and forces herself to stay seated. Rio isn’t Nicky; she’s an adult who needs help, and it takes everything in Agatha to not rush over to her and help her to any piece of furniture to sit on, to force the sling back on her shoulder and glue the cane to her hand. </p><p>“Morning,” she says, keeping her voice soft.</p><p>Rio nods stiffly, barely a tilt of her head, and makes her way to the island.</p><p>They sit in silence for a few minutes. The clock ticks loud in the stillness.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, fingers tightening around her mug. “Do you want to talk about last night?” she asks carefully, keeping her tone light, casual, like she’s asking about the weather.</p><p>Rio stiffens immediately. She doesn’t look up from her coffee.</p><p>“No,” she says, short and sharp.</p><p>Agatha feels the word land like a closed door between them. “Okay,” she says after a beat. “I just- if you need to-”</p><p>“I don’t,” Rio snaps, voice low and rasping but firm.</p><p>Agatha swallows whatever else she might have said and nods once.</p><p>“Alright. I’ll be in my office if you need anything.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>The day drags on.</p><p>Agatha settles into her home office but leaves the door open, working without focus. She knows that Vision can see when she’s online, but she’s not actually doing anything for her company. Instead, she’s Googling how to care for an insanely stubborn patient who nearly died twice in the past two months. Of course the results come up blank, things she doesn’t already know. It’s not Rio’s treatment she wants to crack open, she already knows what needs to happen. It’s Rio herself.</p><p>She listens closely for the faint signs of movement, any sign that Rio is in fact still breathing in the room next door. Relief floods her each time she hears soft scuffling or the sound of the t.v. playing from the guest room.</p><p>Agatha brings food quietly at some point; just some soup, crackers, tea Gatorade as well as her antibiotics and two pain pills in a cup. She’s somewhat satisfied when the food looks picked at and the antibiotics have been taken. She grimaces slightly when she realizes Rio hasn’t touched the painkillers but she doesn’t force her to take them. Rio’s a big girl and she’ll figure out eventually that no human should have to endure that kind of pain, but until then, she’ll remain silent.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>Later that afternoon, Rio shuffles out to the living room, moving slowly and deliberately.</p><p>Agatha watches quietly from the kitchen island as Rio lowers herself painfully slow. She knows Rio’s trying to hide her pain but even she can’t be fooled. It’s then, she realizes that Rio’s not wearing her sling nor is she walking with the cane.</p><p>She doesn’t understand why Rio’s being so stubborn; she gets it, she doesn't want to talk about last night but to have her completely shut down on her while she’s still a guest in her home makes Agatha unnerved. Not in the way that makes her want to kick Rio to the streets, but in the way that she just hopes Rio will see that Agatha’s seen her at quite literally her lowest and she’s still around, willing to help.</p><p>The cane is within both of their eyesights, the sling however, Agatha knows is still on the floor of her bathroom. She too has avoided that room as much as she could. She used to love her morning routine but now, she’s only in and out for the bare minimum, unable to rid the image of Rio submerged underwater.</p><p>For a long moment, Agatha hesitates. Then she moves, quiet and careful throughout her own damn home.</p><p>She crosses the living room, retrieves the cane from where it leans against the couch. Then she disappears briefly into her own bathroom and finds the sling.</p><p>When she returns, Rio hasn’t moved. She’s still curled small on the couch, staring listlessly at the muted flicker of the t.v.</p><p>Agatha sets the cane gently against the side of the couch, within reach but without comment.</p><p>She folds the sling neatly and places it on the coffee table, right next to the untouched plate of toast and tea, and another paper cup with pain mets, left there without expectation.</p><p>Agatha steps back, retreating to her office, feeling the helplessness claw tighter under her ribs, knowing Rio won’t reach for either of them.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>The next day passes much the same; Agatha bringing a light breakfast and coffee to Rio’s room along with her antibiotics and painkillers. </p><p>They don’t exchange words, or even acknowledge each other’s existence. The only sign of life from Rio comes from the television that turns on and off sporadically throughout the day.</p><p>Later on, Rio comes out of her room, probably for a change of scenery Agatha supposes. She does her best not to intrude, which again is stupid she’s the one that lives there. Each step Rio takes is stiff and each breath shallow. When she reaches the island, Agatha thinks she’ll take a break, but no, she goes directly towards the couch.</p><p>When she gets there, she awkwardly bends over the coffee table, reaching for a glass of water that was placed there not too long ago by Agatha, knowing Rio was going to emerge eventually.</p><p>She watches Rio with a baited breath, as her fingers curl around the rim of the glass. She can see the glass shake out of the corner of her eye and before she knows it, the sound of shattering glass echoes throughout the painfully silent penthouse. </p><p>Agatha moves without thinking, halfway across the room before she stops herself.</p><p>Rio flinches at the help, shoulders knotting tight. </p><p>“I’m fine,” she mutters quickly, already crouching down, her breath ragged.</p><p>Agatha freezes, lifting her hands in surrender.</p><p>“Okay,” she says softly.</p><p>She watches, helpless, as Rio gathers the shards with trembling fingers, wiping the floor with clean, slow deliberate motions. </p><p>Blood beads along the edge of one knuckle, a thin, bright thread, but Rio doesn’t so much as flinch.</p><p>When the floor is clean, Rio straightens, breathless and pale, and vanishes back into her room without a word.</p><p>The door clicks shut.</p><p>Agatha stays standing in the kitchen, the weight of the silence pressing down on her like a hand to the throat.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>The days stretch longer after that.</p><p>Sometimes Agatha emerges from her office to see Rio hunched over on the couch. Each time, without fail there’s no sign of the sling. The cane, however, remains untouched by the couch. Each day, the painkillers left on the tray Rio leaves in her room. She moves like every step is an argument with her own body.</p><p>Sometimes, the sound of the television erupts through the shared wall. She can tell Rio is almost done with Brooklyn 99 and she often wonders what she’ll end up watching next.</p><p>Otherwise, they don’t speak to each other. Agatha just keeps setting out the usual tray, like rituals she can’t give up on.</p><p>At night, she doesn’t go back to her room.</p><p>She’s slept on the narrow couch in her office ever since the bathtub incident, just close enough to hear if something goes wrong. Close enough for the nightmares.</p><p>They come in fits. Gasped breaths. Sharp cries choked back behind a closed door. One night, a desperate sound, half sob, half gasp, that has Agatha sitting bolt upright in the dark.</p><p>She doesn’t approach Rio then, She knows better than to offer comfort Rio won’t take.</p><p>But she stays awake long after the sounds stop, just listening, counting the seconds between Rio’s breaths. Pretending that makes a difference. </p><p>They live in parallel, drifting, silent, tense. Not fighting, not healing. Just stuck.</p><p>The television hums in the background, filling the silence with static.</p><p>Once, Agatha catches Rio glancing at her once, just a flicker of guilt and something more, something like grief, before Rio folds in tighter, as if making herself smaller could reverse her memory.</p><p>Agatha looks down at her hands, and lets her heart break quietly inside her chest.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~</p><p> </p><p>By the sixth night, Agatha finally snaps.</p><p>The penthouse feels heavier tonight. The lights of the city outside the windows blur into a meaningless smear, cold and distant.</p><p>Agatha sits at the kitchen counter, staring at nothing, her hands clenching and unclenching around the edge of the marble. Every bone in her body aches with it; the helplessness, the silence, the slow deterioration she can’t stop.</p><p>She pushes herself upright, moving on muscle memory, her steps dragging slightly as she crosses to her office. The door clicks quietly behind her as she crosses the dimly lit room. It’s a modest office, doesn’t look like it belongs in the rest of the penthouse but it’s her safe place. The one place that she can find comfort while ruling over a massive BioTech empire. </p><p>She pulls open the bottom drawer of her desk, the one she hasn’t touched since the hospital and there it is: the tin that she hasn’t seen, nor thought about since she gave it to Vision all those weeks ago.</p><p>Inside is a battered plastic tube, with half a joint tucked inside. The same one she lit but never finished after Rio coded.</p><p>Agatha closes her fingers around it, feeling the weight of it like a confession. She tucks it into her pocket and heads back through the living room. She peeks to her right and see’s that the guest bedroom is still closed and she can hear the faint hum of the tv in there through the walls. She knows Rio’s still awake.</p><p>She crosses to the terrace door on the opposite side of the living room and unlocks it with a soft click. The cold air sends a shiver down her spine, but she doesn’t turn bacak. The city stretches out before her, a sea of endless lights, endless distance. </p><p>Agatha leans against the railing, pulling the joint free, and lights it with a steady hand.</p><p>The first inhale burns deep, searing her lungs, pushing the tightness in her chest just far enough away to breathe around it.</p><p>The second is easier.</p><p>By the third, the world slows.</p><p>The weight in her chest doesn't vanish, but it dulls; blurred at the edges, just enough to make living bearable.</p><p>She tilts her head back, exhaling towards the sky, watching the smoke bleed into the darkness.</p><p>Her limbs relax in a way they haven't in years; her shoulders slump, her heartbeat stops rattling inside her ribs.</p><p>She doesn't feel guilty. Not tonight. Not after what she’s endured in her own home.</p><p>The terrace door creaks open behind her. Soft footsteps scrape against the stone floor.</p><p>Agatha doesn't turn immediately. She closes her eyes, dragging in another breath, feeling the night air sting against her damp lashes.</p><p>Behind her, Rio scoffs. “You’re high.”</p><p>“No shit,” she says into the night, too exhausted to lie.</p><p>“Unbelievable,” Rio mutters, stepping out into the cold without flinching.</p><p>It’s then Agatha turns around. Rio’s barefoot with her arms crossed so tightly, she’d think she’s holding herself together. No cane. No sling. She looks like she’s about to detonate.</p><p>Agatha watches her approach, slowly. She wonders why she’s even out of bed, why she cares. She hadn't before.</p><p>“Don’t judge what you don't know,” she says, low but fraying.</p><p>Rio laughs, sharp and ugly.</p><p>“Oh, so now there's a secret noble reason to get stoned?”</p><p>Agatha straightens from the railing, her free hand tightening into a fist around nothing. She doesn't understand why Rio’s so mad, but she desperately wants to.</p><p>“You think you know me?” she snaps.</p><p>“I know enough,” Rio fires back, stepping closer. Reckless and burning. “I know you’re just some rich hotshot who has a drug addiction and needs something to feel better about yourself.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw locks, eyes blazing. She wants to lash out, wants to say something that would burn, but she doesn't. Because Rio wants her to be angry, she wants a reason to run. And Agatha’s not handing it over that easily.</p><p>“You don't know a damn thing about me,” she says, razor sharp. “Just like you don’t want me knowing a damn thing about you.”</p><p>Rio doesn't flinch. “Oh that’s rich, coming from you.”</p><p>Agatha doesn't move, instead she relaxes into the railing. “Go ahead. Say what you want to say.”</p><p>“I already did,” Rio hisses. “You don't get to play the victim. You locked me in this place like I’m something to fix. You're only here because you feel guilty, and that’s cruel.”</p><p>Agatha barks a short, bitter laugh. “You think this is guilt?” Her voice shakes now, rising. “Six days of silence. Six nights of listening to you cry through the walls and pretending I couldn’t hear it.”</p><p>She steps forward, fury cracking open to something deeper. “You want to talk about cruelty?” Her voice breaks. “You got your memory back, and you chose to pretend I didn’t matter.”</p><p>Rio freezes. Her breath catches like it’s been punched out of her. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t stop. “I sat next to your bed, every single day. I held your hand. I watched the machines breathe for you. And when your eyes finally gave me a flicker of hope that you knew who I was, you gaslit me into thinking I was your fucking mom.”</p><p>“I didn’t know what to do,” Rio whispers, the heat draining from her voice.</p><p>“So you lied,” Agatha snaps. “Not because you had to, because it was easier,” her voice softens, only slightly. “I get it, trust me I do, but I can only do so much for you.”</p><p>“I was scared,” Rio barks back. “I didn’t want to wake up needing someone who could leave.”<br/><br/>“I wasn’t trying to leave, if I wanted to I would've left you in Westview to rot.”</p><p>“You should’ve,” Rio mutters.</p><p>Agatha steps forward, every word trembling. “But I didn’t. And you’ve been trying to punish me for that ever since. What did I do to deserve this?”</p><p>“I didn’t ask you to stay,” Rio hisses, tears welling in her eyes.</p><p>“You didn’t have to,” Agatha says, voice rising only slightly. “First thing you said when you woke up? You didn’t remember me, but you didn’t want me to go.”</p><p>Rio squeezes her eyes shut. Just for a second. Like she can silence the truth if she can’t see the messenger.</p><p>Agatha’s voice softens again, heartbreaking at the sight in front of her. Weeks ago, Rio had told her that she fought to kill, that isn't her goal right now, but she can't stand by without speaking her thoughts. “So don’t rewrite the story just because it’s easier to burn it all down.</p><p>Rio opens her mouth, then closes it again. “I didn’t want anyone to see me like this.”</p><p>“Well I already did,” Agatha says. “And I stayed.”</p><p>Rio’s head shakes, slow and unsteady. “That’s on you.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha corrects. “That’s because of you.”</p><p>“You should’ve left.”</p><p>“You keep saying that,” Agatha says. “But you didn’t want me to go. You would've told me the first time I brought you home. You just didn’t want to let yourself stay.”</p><p>Rio tries to speak. But she can’t. Her legs give out before the words form.</p><p>Agatha is already moving. She catches Rio mid-fall, arms wrapping tight around her trembling frame.</p><p>Rio tries to fight her physically but her body won’t respond. Instead fists curl into Agatha’s sweater. Her breath hitches as sobs wrack through Rio’s fragile body. This isn't about her, Agatha realizes.</p><p>Agatha lowers them both to the terrace floor, mindful of Rio’s state. She doesn’t speak, nor does she let go.</p><p>Rio buries her face in Agatha’s shoulder and lets herself shake. Not in forgiveness. Not in surrender. But because she physically can’t keep standing and keep holding it in any longer</p><p>Her body is wrecked. Her ribs scream. Her legs are lead. Her throat burns. But none of that compares to the ache behind her ribs.</p><p>It’s not safety nor peace, but she’s not alone, and for now, that’s enough.</p><p>Agatha holds her, and doesn’t let her fall alone. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The first thing Rio registers is a dull, full-body soreness, like she’s been wrung out and left to dry. Her ribs throb a deep, slow pulse that flares with every breath.. Her shoulder aches sharply beneath the sling she’s not even wearing yet. Even her legs are stiff and heavy, like they’re not even hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second thing she notices is the smell. It’s clean linen, lavender, and something citrusy; faint and expensive. It hits somewhere between comfort and displacement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinks against the morning light bleeding through unfamiliar curtains.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The memory seeps in, thick and disjointed: the cold air on the terrace, her voice sharp and cracking, her knees giving gout, arms catching her before the ground could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t remember going inside, nor does she remember going to sleep, only the neverending trembling silence afterward. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The blanket weighs on her chest like a second skin. Rio shifts, wincing as her ribs pinch tight and sharp. Her body’s been cleaned up - she’s wearing one of Agatha’s sleep shirts, the fabric worn thin with age and her hair’s been braided loosely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a glass of water on the nightstand. A paper cup with her antibiotics, and two pain pills. Folded underneath them is a yellow sticky note, the writing scrawled and slanted but unmistakably Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Take them.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Next to the water, propped neatly against the edge of the nightstand, are the sling and the cane - cleaned, untangled, within reach. Not waiting like a command. Just… there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stares at the note for a long moment, her good hand lying limp against the sheets. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Something twists behind her ribs. Not pain. Not even anger. Just a hollow, aching hum she doesn’t have words for. Something like being seen, and not knowing what the hell to do with it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forces herself upright, breathing shallowly through the flare of her ribs. She takes the antibiotics without a fight but leaves the painkillers and the note behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t stay in bed all day. After a while, the quiet grows too loud; the air is thick with the hum of the city outside with only the faint tick of a clock she’s come to be accompanied by the past few days. She pushes the blanket off and swings her legs over the edge. She plants her good hand on the mattress, steadying herself. Every moment sends a ripple of soreness through her body, but she rides it out. Her feet hit the floor with a quiet thud. The hardwood is cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cane waits by the nightstand. She ignores it for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bedroom feels too large, too clean. The walls are painted in muted grays and soft creams. The only sign of human chaos: a worn sweater slung over a chair, a coffee cup abandoned on the dresser, a hair tie looped lazily around a lamp switch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>None if it feels familiar, but it doesn’t feel unfamiliar either. That’s the worst part.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moves slowly toward the adjoining bathroom, her hand trailing the wall for balance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The mirror stops her cold. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hasn’t looked at herself since that night, hasn’t dared. But now, there’s no avoiding it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forces herself to meet her own reflection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman staring back at her is pale, drawn, unfamiliar, in somehow a worse state than when she saw herself a few days ago. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She lifts the sling with clumsy fingers. It takes two tries to get it on. Her right shoulder protests violently, muscles spasming against the strain. She grits her teeth, adjusts the strap and gets it secured. It’s crooked and sloppy, but at least it’s on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath is loud in the silence. Agatha’s words fill the space. </span>
<em>
<span>You don't know a damn thing about me, just like you don't want me knowing a damn thing about you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She stares at herself for another long moment, not recognizing, not rejecting. Just trying to remember.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The apartment feels huge and wrong when she steps into it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The hardwood floor chills her bare feet. The walls hum with the faint pulse of city life: muted car horns, distant sirens, and the low whine of heating vents kicking on and off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grip tightens around the cane, moving carefully, breathing shallowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she rounds the corner into the kitchen, Agatha is already there; barefoot, sleeves pushed to her elbows, hair a messy twist pinned haphazardly at the nape of her neck. She’s pouring water into a kettle with the kind of bone-deep tiredness that speaks louder than any words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turns as Rio limps closer, her eyes flicking quickly over the sling, cane, and the stiff way Rio favors her left side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she doesn’t comment, just nods once and turns back to the kettle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leans against the nearest wall, catching her breath. Her legs already ache with the effort of standing. Her ribs throb in a slow, mean pulse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moves like she’s underwater, careful, deliberate, and fluid. She sets two mugs on the kitchen island: one near her, one nearer to Rio. Not close enough to force a choice, just available.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Chamomile,” she says, her voice rough. “Didn’t know how you like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That hits harder than it should. Rio doesn't know how she likes it either. Was she a tea person? Did she drink coffee? Did she used to sweeten it? Milk or honey?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing comes, so she nods, wordless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She drags herself to the stool at the island, lowering herself with painstaking care. Every muscle in her body protests. The cane rests awkwardly against her good knee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She curls her hand around the mug. It’s warm against her skin, grounding her in a way that’s there, but not fulfilling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sit in silence for a while. The kind that used to feel unbearable. Now it feels like a ceasefire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tea is nearly gone when Agatha finally speaks again. Her voice is quiet, almost defeated. “I scheduled someone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks up slowly. Agatha’s gaze is fixed on her own mug, her knuckles are pale from how tightly she’s holding it. “PT consult,” she continues, “tomorrow. Just an evaluation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s chest tightens. Her first instinct is to refuse, to say she’s not ready, that she’ll do it on her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cuts herself off before Rio can speak.</span>
<span>“You don’t have to,” she says quickly. “I can cancel. I just-” She exhales. “You need it. I know you know that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks down at the tea in her hands, watching the steam curl like smoke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She used to hike before the sun even rose. She used to be able to go miles without breaks. Now, she can barely walk from the bedroom to the kitchen without needing to sit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glances at her then, surprise flickering behind her eyes. She doesn’t smile, nor relax. Just nods once, the smallest movement. But it feels like something is shifting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The physical therapist arrives just after lunch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s brisk and professional with her hair tied back and a clipboard tucked under one arm. She carries the steady calm of someone who’s seen worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha is nowhere to be seen. Only a folded note was left on the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Back to back meetings, you’ve got this.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio listens carefully for any commotion from Agatha’s home office. She knows she’s in there, but she can’t hear anything from a computer, not even the soft tapping of the keyboard or a clicking of any pens. Just silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio folds the note with trembling fingers and tucks it into her pocket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They start slow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mobility first - gentle circles with ehr wrist, her elbow, her battered shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Strength second - half-stands, wall slides, balancing without falling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Balance last - stepping sideways, backward, one foot at a time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s hell; the pain lights her nerves on fire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the fourth exercise her breath hitches uncontrollably. By the sixth, her body shakes so violently she has to brace herself against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re doing good,” the therapist says. Her words are calm, not patronizing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It doesn’t help.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every failure, every stumble, every grimace, every tremor, feels like a personal betrayal. A reminder that she’s not the woman she was in the woods. Not even close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That woman is gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe Rio’s the one who didn’t survive the fall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the therapist leaves, Rio collapses onto the couch, muscles screaming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t cry, nor scream. She just lies there, staring at the ceiling, ice pressed beneath her sling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The apartment is still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The therapist’s instructions sit unread on the table. She glances at the t.v. remote, but doesn’t reach for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze drifts to the end table. There’s a mug there, deep green with a tiny crack near the base. She picks it up slowly, holding it in her good hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something tugs in her chest. She’s seen this mug before. She used to use it, maybe more than once. But she can’t remember when. Or why. Or what she used to drink out of it. She doesn’t even know if it’s hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The familiarity makes her stomach turn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sets it back down carefully, like it might burn her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha comes out of her office sometime in the late afternoon. She’s still bone-tired. She doesn't say anything, just walks right into the kitchen and starts making toast. She doesn't ask Rio how the first session went, she’s just there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The toast sizzles in the pan. The soft scrape of butter against bread fills the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her without meaning to. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The smallness of the gesture, food, warmth, and presence cuts sharper than any fight they could have had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha sets a plate beside her, she still doesn’t say anything. Just places it within reach, and then leaves her be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kitchen light hums faintly. The city breathes against the windows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifts a piece of toast with trembling fingers and takes a bite. The silence is deafening.</span>

<p>
<span>The morning light cuts through the guest bedroom curtains in sharp, golden slats. It spills across the bed in long, uneven stripes, catching on the worn edges of the comforter and the loose folds of a sweatshirt someone must have left draped over the chair. The air smells faintly of pine, it should bring Rio comfort, but it doesn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not the woods. It’s not the clean sting of evergreen after a storm or the dry, sun warmed bark she grew up around. It’s curated - artificial - bottled serenity. She remembers Agatha putting it there the day she arrived.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back then, Rio didn't have the strength to care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now it settles uneasily in her lungs; a reminder of how hard someone else tried to make her feel at home in a place that isn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wakes slowly, body still wrecked from yesterday’s PT. The ache registers before anything else. Every muscle fiber, what’s left of them, in Rio’s body feels like lead, the kind that sinks deep into the bone and stays.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shifts carefully under the covers. The sling’s already on, properly this time. Agatha fitted while she slept. Her hair’s been rebraided too loosely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On top of that, something else feels different. She feels clean.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s no sweat sticking her shirt to her spine nor is there a feverish grime clinging to her skin. Her hair’s been re-braided loosely, the tangles worked out by careful, methodical hands she didn’t feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t have to think hard to guess whose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cane leans against the nightstand. There’s a glass of water and a paper cup with her antibiotic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>No pain meds. No sticky note. It’s not a mistake, Rio realizes. She hasn't taken the pills, and Agatha definitely noticed, so she stopped offering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows the antibiotic and sets the cup down gently, her fingers brushing the edge of the nightstand like it might steady her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She should feel proud, but instead she feels something hollow twist behind her ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gets up slowly, testing her weight. Her legs are stiff and her body protests the movement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The hardwood floor is cool beneath her feet, the air in the apartment is still, thick with morning stillness and the faint, stale bitterness of leftover coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She braces one hand on the doorframe and starts down the hall, cane tapping quietly with each step.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kitchen is half lit, warm with the early sun. Agatha sits at the island, staring off into space, with a mug placed a few inches in front of her clasped hands. She looks more tired than Rio, if that’s even possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s something about it that makes it impossible for Rio to not say anything. “You look like shit,” she says flatly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes tear from her thoughts and meets Rio’s gaze. There’s a hint of a smirk on her face, and the tension in Agatha’s shoulders release, only slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No shit,” she says, voice laced with exhaustion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go sleep in your bed,” Rio urges. Agatha looks like she wants to resist. She doesn't move, instead she takes another sip from her mug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're bossy,” she remarks, but the humor isn't there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you're sleep deprived,” Rio quips. “Go, I think I can manage a few hours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reluctantly stands from the table and retreats towards her room, before she closes the door, she turns back around and speaks before she can stop herself. “Don’t die on me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s left alone in the kitchen. It's the most emotion she's heard out of Agatha since she first woke up, just a simple plea but it’s heard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The penthouse feels larger without Agatha’s waking presence. She decides that she doesn't like it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She moves at a snail's pace around the kitchen, doing her best to tidy up. It's frustratingly clean and doesn't take her long to wipe down the countertops. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It takes more strength than she’d like to open the fridge, and Rio doesn't know if she’s over or underwhelmed by her options. It’s not fully stocked, but enough. Agatha clearly hasn’t had time to do a full grocery run, but there’s enough non-perishables for Rio to make eggs for herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>An embarrassingly long time later, Rio sits at the island where Agatha just was, picking at her plate, thinking about how she ended up here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was once a time in Rio’s life where she didn’t want to leave the park. She didn’t have any big aspirations, just a simple desire to be among nature. If she could, she’d fake her own death and just live peacefully in a cabin somewhere, maybe she’d leave Westview, maybe she wouldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembers the warmth of life she felt during her childhood, even with the gaps in her memory. That blanket disappeared when her parents died and she tried to seek comfort among the trees, but it wasn't the same. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she begrudgingly eats the plate of eggs, she tries to remember more about her teenage years, but draws a blank. She doesn't remember memories, but she remembers her emotions. She doesn't recall her first kiss, her first love nor her first time, but she remembers the feeling of heartbreak and loneliness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she thinks of Westview, she doesn't find that same familiar sense of comfort she remembers from her childhood. Instead she feels a pressure in her chest. It’s restrictive, like a weight pressing down, keeping her there. She asks herself why she never left. It’s a simple answer really, she couldn't leave her parents behind, but they left her first, and she didn't know how to move forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not until Lady Death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembers the adrenaline coursing through her body as she expertly weaved through the paths. At first it was a solemn act, but over the years it became a game to Rio. Now it’s one she doesn't think she has the heart nor body to keep playing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio recalls the fight from the other day. </span>
<em>
<span>You’ve locked me in here</span>
</em>
<span>. But she was wrong, she isn’t a prisoner. Agatha has been by her side since the accident; offering to pay for everything, setting up appointments and stepping it away from whatever it is she does for a living. She knows she was at least a guest star in the past, she couldn't forget seeing her face on the screen where she was holding Boyle’s sperm captive, god what a subplot, but she realizes Agatha was right. They don't know a thing about each other, and yet here Agatha is, sleeping down the hall, keeping Rio alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she was back in Westview, Rio doesn't know if she’d be alive right now. She remembers not wanting to die after the fall, but she doesn't know how to live.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The emotions are too much for Rio to handle, it brings a different kind of pain to her chest and her head. Out of the corner of her eye, she spots an orange pill bottle with a full prescription at the edge of the island. It pains her to reach for it, but she doesn't have the energy to walk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When it’s within grasp, grabs it and holds it in her trembling hand. She hastily uncaps the bottle, takes a pill out and dry swallows it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The relief is instant and she berates herself for being so stubborn and not taking it earlier. A wave of exhaustion crashes over Rio but she also remembers the panic in Agatha’s voice the last time she was in a compromising position. She’s glad when she sees a notepad and a pen nearby and instantly tears a piece of paper off and scribbles with her left hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It looks like a five-year-old wrote it, but in her defense her dominant hand is still in a sling and she’s weaker than normal. She places her head against the cool marble countertop and stops fighting the exhaustion in her body, letting her heavy eyelids close.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hours later Agatha wakes to a quiet apartment. She feels better rested despite her physical appearance. She hasn't really slept since before all this started.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she enters the kitchen area, she see’s Rio hunched over the countertop and panic surges through her body again when she sees the open orange bottle next to Rio’s limp hand. She sprints over there and next to the bottle, she sees a note.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Not dead, just sleeping.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The four simple words bring Agatha more relief than she’s felt in a long time. A dry chuckle leaves her lips as she places the note back on the countertop. Still, she checks Rio’s wrist and tension releases from her body when she finds a steady, slow pulse beneath the skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cleans the dishes quickly and scoops Rio’s body up in her arms and brings her over to the guest bedroom, laying her in a more comfortable position that doesn't set back her progress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She then brings in her laptop and settles in a nearby chair, finally addressing the thousands of emails she needs to catch up on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It takes a long time, but with Vision in charge she hasn't needed to worry about HMX since all this went down, but her sudden upheaval in routine’s left her restless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she’s reading through an email on a current proposal for a new imaging software, her stomach rumbles loudly through Rio’s soft breathing. When she makes her way to her fridge, she takes in the empty sight and immediately places a grocery order. Embarrassment flushes through her as she realizes Rio sees how little she has to offer, but in her defense she’s been a little distracted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Within the hour, her private elevator opens to several bags and she quietly restocks her kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s just about done when she hears Rio emerge from down the hall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, didn't mean to fall asleep,” Rio says through a yawn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You needed it,” Agatha says while folding the last of her bags. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She makes her way over to the island slowly and grabs her cane. “Finally,” Rio remarks when she sees fresh groceries in the fridge and cabinets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’ve been a bit preoccupied,” Agatha says defensively, but her words lack any real bite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Feeling better?” Rio tries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eh, you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you finally took painkillers,” Agatha says, nodding to the still-open bottle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs softly, but shrugs slightly. “I had a headache.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything okay?” Agatha asks a little too quickly. Rio can see the concern in Agatha’s eyes and her stomach twists slightly, but with that twist, returns a familiar warmth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, just trying to remember everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The doctor said-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know what they've said, doesn't mean I have to like it,” Rio interjects. When she sees Agatha tense at her words, she softens. “Sorry, I just- I remember recent events but everything else is still hazy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a short pause and Rio continues. “I remember the milestones, not that I had many, but the small details are just blank.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s silent for a moment, unsure of what to say. She’s surprised Rio actually opened up for once, not that she wasn't already aware of her amnesia, the doctor’s have explained it several times, but more so at the vulnerability in Rio’s features and voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get it,” she finally says. “Not to your extent, but the feeling of not knowing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She lets the words settle between them and Rio looks like she’s trying to put a puzzle together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s posture makes it known she doesn't want to elaborate, at least not yet and Rio respects that. She fiddles with the hem of her shirt, suddenly uncomfortable with the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her ringtone rips through the steady stream of the sink water, and she groans when she sees the contact name. She’s in the middle of doing dishes but she never ignores Wanda’s call. She taps accept and puts the phone on speaker. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” she says flatly, sounding already annoyed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Am I chopped liver to you?” Wanda shoots back, ignoring the greeting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t it like 1 am in Amsterdam?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not anymore, production ended early and don't you dare deflect. Tell me why I had to hear from my son that Rio’s awake? And why did I have to hear from my husband that she was in a coma in the first place?” Agatha stills at the question and glances over to Rio, who has a cracker halfway to her mouth, eyes wide but amused with the situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is there a reason I didn’t know Vision’s name was Robert until now?” Agatha fires back, deadpan. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you were literally </span>
<em>
<span>in</span>
</em>
<span> the wedding, not my fault you’re horrible with names.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So your children aren't named Billiam and Toby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Chopped. Liver.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In my defense, he’s my business partner and he came to the hospital a few times. And ‘Vision’ is a </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> weird nickname for Robert.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“... fair point,” Wanda concedes and Agatha can hear noise in the background</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There a reason you’re calling, or did you just want to scold me with international data charges?” Agatha asks impatiently. Rio remains silent, munching thoughtfully. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes actually. I’m coming over tomorrow.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly drugs the mug she’s rinsing. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you, I’m delivering the goods-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How the fuck did you smuggle weed into this country-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“-and I’m bringing stuff for Rio,” Wanda steamrolls right through. “Vis went home and came back with another few duffel bags, Lilia said it might help, you know, pieces of home and all that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a brief pause on the line. Agatha sets the mug down with a little more force than necessary and glances toward Rio, who’s already looking back. Neither say anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow furrows slightly. Rio shrugs, still chewing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, blissfully unaware or purposely ignoring the moment continues. “It’s not just sweaters and ranger maps, there’s a ton of other things too. Apparently Rio used to live off of honey-roasted peanuts?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks. “I did?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! You didn't tell me I was on speaker!!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, drying her hands and leans against the other side of the island across from Rio. “Jesus, you heard the sink running, what did you think I was doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you were multitasking!” Wanda snaps. “I didn’t know I was doing a TED Talk in front of the cryptid ranger!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chokes on her cracker, coughing into her elbow. “Cryptid?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda doesn’t slow down. “You’re damn right. One of you fakes amnesia, the other goes full Victorian grieving widow, and somehow I’m the one that’s caught off guard?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t-” Rio starts, but Wanda pushes forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyways, I’ll be there at noon tomorrow, don't be a stranger!” The line clicks dead before either can interject again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drops her forehead into her hand with a groan, fingers digging into her temple as if the action would ward off Wanda’s inevitable storm of chaos. She loves her, she really does but her timing is unfortunate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Across the island, Rio is still silent, a cracker halfway to her mouth. Then, she speaks quietly, as if confirming she just heard the words properly. “Weed and peanuts?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s tame for her,” Agatha says, head still in her hand. “She once brought in a raccoon for Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, she </span>
<em>
<span>what?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She claimed it was emotionally neglected. Said it had ‘orphan energy’ or some shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slowly lets the cracker down. “And you let her keep it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told her no. She let it loose in here anyways, didn't help that Nicky wanted another friend, but it bit him and then shat in my bathtub.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god,” Rio says, trying to hide a laugh but regrets it with her ribs. “Ow- okay, not worth it. That’s- yeah I don't know what to say to that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can feel a migraine coming on from the memory,” Agatha says, squeezing her eyes shut.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances over at her. Agatha’s leaning hard against the counter now, fingers digging into the back of her neck like she’s holding her skull in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without another word, she pushes off the marble and ventures towards her office, coming out just a few moments later with a joint and lighter in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be back,” is all she says before walking out to the terrace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio is still sitting in stunned silence when she hears the faint scratch of the lighter. She exhales slowly and leans her head back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” she mutters. “Weed and peanuts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sits there in silence for a few more seconds, the last echo of Wanda’s voice still bouncing around in her skull.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she moves, slowly and swiftly, grabbing the cane and pushes herself up from the chair. Her body throbs in protest and she makes a mental note to take another painkiller before bed, but the pull to follow Agatha is stronger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The terrace door slides open smoothly. She’s glad or else it would've been an embarrassing sight for herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s leaning against the railing with her back to the city, one arm crossed while the other brings the joint to her lips in practiced rhythm. Her hair flows freely with the wind, and Rio doesn't think she’s seen anything more beautiful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio steps out onto the stone, the cold a bitter reminder of her body’s frail state. She moves towards one of the chairs, easing down with a quiet breath, her cane balancing at the edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s quiet for a few moments, Rio can see Agatha’s features soften and her body relax with each exhale, but curiosity still gnaws at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you ever going to tell me how you can afford this place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glances at her with one eyebrow raised. “That’s your opener?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would you rather I start another fight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs a quiet laugh, smoke curling out of the corner of her mouth. “I’d rather you let me pretend I’m just some rich hotshot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grimaces. “You remember that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glances over with a soft smile on her face. “Hard to forget someone being insulted by a half-alive ghost”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leans back in the chair slowly. “I didn't mean it like that. I was just mad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn't the first time nor will it be the last,” Agatha waves off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're deflecting,” Rio comments. Agatha groans slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I build things,” she says, pinching the bridge of her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s incredibly vague.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's </span>
<em>
<span>intentionally </span>
</em>
<span>vague,” Agatha corrects. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s also not acting,” Rio points out. Agatha glares at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit I knew that was going to come back and bite me in the ass. You seriously didn’t Google me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell is Google?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squints at Rio, unsure if she’s being serious. “Is this amnesia talking or are you being serious?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax,” Rio says, barely. “I know what the internet is, but that kind of defeats the reclusive vibe I have going on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha eyes her sideways. “God, you’re exhausting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only to rich hot-shots with something to hide,” Rio shoots back, the smirk tugging a little harder at the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should’ve let you fall off that cliff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You kind of did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow.” Agatha turns to her fully now, mock offended. “Victim blaming?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only a little,” Rio murmurs, her voice quieting again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They fall into a silence, the kind that doesn’t bite. The city hums softly below them, and the cold doesn’t feel quite so sharp with the warmth between them stretched invisibly across the distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to act,” Agatha says eventually, voice distant like she’s already halfway out of the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks, surprised but careful not to give too much of a reaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Couple roles here and there, nothing too serious. Then… something stuck.” She taps the ash over the railing, watching the wind carry it down toward the city. “Wanda was in the project with me, and we both blew up overnight. She loved it. I… tolerated it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence stretches for a few moments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then?” Rio asks gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't look at her. “I burned out. Hard. Turning to things I shouldn't have just to keep my sanity, all while somehow still working.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stays quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda and Vis were already settled by then,” Agatha says. “And I was drifting. Until Nicky. He came after and changed everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You're just the girl who got knocked up in rehab,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio remembers, but keeps the thought to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another puff of smoke spirals into the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“By then, I couldn't go back. So I did what I could. Vis was working on some diagnostic software, stuff no one believed in yet. I funded it, mostly out of desperation, but it worked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha keeps her eyes on the skyline as she pushes through the story. “One prototype led to another. Then a few patents. A few companies started paying attention. Then HMX happened. Not out of brilliance… just survival.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales softly, like she’s putting the pieces of Agatha Harkness together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn't expect that,” she says gently. “The acting, I mean. You don't seem like someone who likes being seen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth twitches, just barely. “I don't, not anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods, following Agatha's gaze towards the city. “I get it. Being invisible is easier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pauses briefly, inhaling the cool air. “Now, I wonder if that's why I can't remember who I am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't answer right away. Just stares out at the skyline like it might offer her the right words. The joint burns low between her fingers, forgotten.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally speaks, her voice is quieter than before. “Or maybe your mind is just trying to protect you from who you used to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turns her head slightly, eyes narrowing. “You think that’s a good thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales slowly. “I think… sometimes we survive things by not looking at them too closely. It’s not the same as healing, but it buys us time to make peace with it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze drops to the space between them, to the narrow stretch of stone, cold and empty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Time hasn't made anything clearer, I still feel like a foreign person in this body.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha then looks over to her, downcast. “Maybe remembering everything isn’t the point. Maybe it’s about deciding who you want to be now, in this body.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio breaths out, shaky. “That sounds like something people say when they don't know what to do with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offers a small, tired smile. “Yeah, but it doesn't mean it's wrong.” She pauses, then offers. “I didn't know what to do with myself either, not for a long time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks at her, softer now. “What changed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha meets her eyes. “Someone gave a shit, even when I didn't.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales a dry, shaky laugh. “You're oddly philosophical for someone actively getting high.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, unashamed of her state of being. “You live through what I did, you earn that right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilts her head, studying her. “And what did you live through?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's another story for another night,” she says quietly, but firmly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods slowly. “That’s fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence lingers, not heavy this time, just settled peacefully</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha eyes the sky for a long beat, the sun is still out but there’s a bite to the wind now, sharp against skin already stretched thin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shifts her weight. “Come on,” she says softly. “Let’s go in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't argue, just exhales through her nose and nods, letting Agatha move first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walks to her side and offers a hand without speaking. It’s not dramatic, just steady, like she’s done this before. Like she’ll keep doing it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio takes it without hesitation and slowly rises to her feet. The cane taps against the stone as she moves, her legs protesting every movement but Agatha stays beside her without a word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They move slowly back inside, one step at a time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The warmth of the penthouse hits immediately, a contrast so sharp it’s almost a comfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t let go until Rio’s settled on the couch. She fixes a blanket over her and flicks the remote to queue something up, and only then does she speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Feet up,” she murmurs, already reaching for the throw pillow to tuck behind Rio’s back. “I’ll get dinner ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t argue, instead she lets her head fall back against the cushion, eyes slipping shut. She doesn’t know what this is just yet, this new rhythm between them, but for now, it feels close to something that could last.</span>

<p>
<span>The elevator chimes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s a soft, polite sound, but in the quiet stillness of the penthouse, it might as well have been a bomb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio startles awake first, the jolt running from her spine to her chest like she’s been dunked in cold water. Her ribs protest immediately, and she bites back a hiss, blinking away the tears that have welled in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s curled awkwardly against the armrest of the couch, legs tucked beneath her, a throw blanket half-draped over her shoulder. Across from her, slumped back against the cushions, Agatha doesn’t stir right away, she’s still wrapped in the kind of heavy sleep that only comes after a high and a week of emotional whiplash.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator dings again. Louder this time. Closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes snap open. Her hair’s a mess, her expression caught somewhere between murder and panic. “What time is it?” she mumbles, voice wrecked from sleep and weed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squints at the microwave clock across the kitchen. “Eight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In the morning?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Agatha. At night. We time-traveled through brunch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both sit up slowly, disoriented and stiff. Rio stretches with a grimace, her sling tugging against her shoulder. Agatha runs a hand over her face, dragging herself upright with a groan. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator doors slide open with a dramatic hiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda Maximoff steps out like she’s descending onto a red carpet instead of a private residential floor. Sunglasses on. Long coat and two duffel bags in her left hand and a bag of groceries slung over her right shoulder like a battlefield trophy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Happy birthday!” She calls out cheerfully. “You weren’t answering your phone, so I assumed you’d either died or were being dramatic again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not my birthday,” Agatha grumbles from the couch. “I literally just bought groceries.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda doesn’t flinch. “Not today, no. But if I waited for the actual date, you’d have time to dodge me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She beelines for the kitchen island, dropping the bag with the elegance of someone who’s absolutely going to make a mess. The smell of something fresh, rosemary maybe, or mint, wafts from it like a peace offering wrapped in spite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio is still frozen upright on the couch, her hand braced on the cane, unsure whether to stand or pretend she’s furniture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, hi?” she manages.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda whirls around. “Oh my god, she speaks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks. “I’ve been speaking-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“-sure,” she interrupts breezily, “but now you’re upright and talking, which means I’m officially allowed to interrogate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please don’t,” Agatha mutters into a throw pillow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax,” Wanda says, unloading the groceries with flair. “I come unarmed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, she’s a walking press conference,” Agatha mutters to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this normal?” Rio whispers back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is tame.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda claps her hands together. “Now. Which one of you wants to explain why you didn’t tell me she was conscious. I had to hear from Vision, who went to go see you?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was busy almost dying,” Rio deadpans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was busy keeping her from dying,” Agatha adds. “And you were out of the country.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shrugs. “Fair. Still Rude though.” She then raises an eyebrow at the exchange, then points an accusing finger at Agatha like she’s building a case in court.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look like you haven’t slept in four days and you’re wearing that same ratty sweatshirt I’ve been trying to throw out since 2017.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifts her middle finger without looking up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here? It’s not even noon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shrugs easily. “Jet lag.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda kicks off her boots and makes a beeline for the kitchen like she owns the place. Rio watches her rifle through cabinets, muttering insults at the shelf organization, then finally emerges with a frying pan that looks entirely too clean.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me this pan hasn't only been used as a mirror.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, still groggy, joins her with a long stretch. “It’s new, the others are already in rotation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda pauses. “You have a rotation now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can cook,” Agatha says simply, grabbing a mixing bowl. “Try not to look so shocked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just figured your stove was decorative, like your bookshelf in LA."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks. “That bookshelf was very functional, it held plants.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dead ones.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tucks the blanket closer over her legs, her fingers curling gently beneath the edge. The sling is beginning to dig into her collarbone again, but she doesn't shift it. She watches as Wanda lifts a lemon from the bag, squints at it like it’s personally offended her, and rolls it across the counter with a shrug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re doing breakfast,” Wanda declares, “but make it tragic, and French.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No one is poaching anything,” Agatha warns as she cracks eggs into a bowl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda sighs and starts unwrapping a block of cheese. “You’ve changed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve had to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches them together. The way Wanda moves like she belongs in the room. The way Agatha softens without realizing it. The way they fall into a rhythm of shared space and inside jokes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not mean, nor exclusive, but it makes Rio feel like she’s watching something that existed long before her and will continue long after she's gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiles once, faint and tired, and tries to rid the growing knot in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They eat at the island. The eggs are loaded with dairy and Rio manages half a piece of french toast before the ache in her ribs and the burn in her shoulder dull her appetite. She doesn't complain, just sets the fork down quietly beside her plate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda is halfway through a chaotic retelling of a press event with someone getting locked in a walk-in freezer. Agatha chimes in with dry commentary, clearly familiar with the story's more absurd plot points.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio listens and nods where appropriate, even manages a weak laugh, but her energy dissipates.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s during one of Wanda’s flailing impressions that invokes a genuine smile from Agatha, one she hasn't really seen since the hospital that Rio clears her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I’m gonna go lie down for a bit,” she says. Her voice isn't shaky, just small.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda stops, arms mid-air. “Seriously? That french toast wasn't that heavy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” she says gently. “Just tired, someone barged in at the ass crack of dawn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That gets a half snort from Agatha and an unapologetic  shrug from Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wipes her hand on a towel and tilts her head. “Let me know if you need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will,” Rio lies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stands slowly, careful not to favor one side too much. The cane taps against the hardwood, subtle but there. She doesn't wait for more questions, just nods and silently stalks down the hallway towards the guest bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door clicks softly a good minute later..</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda sips her coffee, still eyeing the hallway. “If I wasn't married and you didn't already have feelings, I’d hit that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't hesitate to whip a dish towel at Wanda’s arm with a snap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grins like she's just won a game no one else was playing. “What? Just calling it like I see it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turns to the sink, muttering under her breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The door clicks shut behind Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leans against it, catching her breath. She shouldn't be this winded, but she is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she moves slowly to the bed, not turning on the light. It’s not necessary; the sun spills through the curtains anyways, sharp lines cutting across the walls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sits on the edge of the mattress, the weight of her body sinking just slightly. The blanket is neatly folded, and the room still smells faintly of pine. It’s not her room, but it was made to accommodate her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just down the hall, she can still hear Wanda’s voice echo throughout the penthouse, it’s light and easy. She can also hear Agatha’s laugh, something she hasn’t heard… ever really. It’s relaxed in a way that Rio’s never known from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s not jealous nor she shouldn't care; this isn't her home, these aren't her people. This is recovery. It’s temporary, transactional. She saved Nicky, Agatha is grateful, that’s all this is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it doesn't feel like gratitude when Agatha folds her blankets, or leaves her medicine next to the nightstand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It feels like something else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now Rio doesn't know how to handle that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shifts carefully, lowering herself down to the bed. Her entire body feels like it’s been left out in the cold for too long and hasn't thawed properly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She curls into her good side, her left, arm tucked in tight and just lays there above the comforter. And she berates herself, not for being hurt or for needing help, but for wanting these little acts that Agatha’s done these past few weeks to mean something more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t know when this shift happened, when Agatha’s small gestures turned into something more to Rio</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe it was when she kicked Agatha out of the hospital room for the first time and she came back. Maybe it was the fact that Agatha had gone out of her way to make Rio feel at home when she was so far away from her cabin - the air freshener, the mountain wallpaper on the t.v. in the guest room and the tablet she has no idea where it is now. Maybe it's the way Agatha somehow knows what Rio needs, whether it’s the antibiotics or giving her space when Rio was overwhelmed; that week of silence was torture for her too but she was drowning and didn't want to be saved. Or maybe, it was after last night's conversation when Rio realized she’d misjudged who Agatha really is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lets out a slow, defeated breath and stares at the wall. She doesn't know how long she lays like that until she hears a soft knock on the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She knows it’s Agatha, and her heart warms at her checking in on her even with one of her closest friends down the hall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t answer right away, just keeps staring off at the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans against the doorframe, patient, watching the steady rise and fall of Rio’s shoulders. Knowing Agatha’s watching Rio sends another wave of warmth but also uneasiness through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, just need a few minutes,” Rio says quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't press, just nods once, but doesn't make a move to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, where’s that tablet Nicky gave me?” Rio asks suddenly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilts her head slightly, like the question catches her off guard. “In my office, why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you get it for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studies her for a moment, then nods without pressing. She disappears for a second and returns with the shiny tablet in hand, laying it gently beside Rio on the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Need anything else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lingers for a beat, then backs out quietly, pulling the door halfway closed behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lays there staring at the device for another few beats of silence, watching it like it might bite. She remembers her confusion when Nicky pulled it out for the first time; how his fingers moved across the screen like it was second nature, how the machine seemed to respond before he even finished touching it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt like watching someone summon fire. Now, Rio groans as she sits upright, pulling the tablet into her lap, the screen dark and waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She presses the button on the side slowly, and the familiar mountain backdrop greets her. At the bottom of the screen, the words ‘swipe up to unlock’ shimmer subtly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It takes her three tries to get it right. The home screen blooms open with a grid of unfamiliar icons, all too colorful and vaguely threatening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tries one, and an animated video of a raccoon in a chef's hat starts screaming about meal prep. She jumps at the sound, scrambling to lower the volume, and taps the screen several times until the animal vanishes and the home screen comes back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope, absolutely not,” she mutters under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tries another, this one opening what looks like a digital calendar and within seconds a notification pops up that reads </span>
<em>
<span>Weekly Board Sync, Monday 2 p.m.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, I’ll pencil it in for right after another existential crisis,” she remarks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back to the home screen, she finds a small icon with a compass and taps it. She sees a blue dot appear on the screen and realizes it's the location of Agatha’s penthouse. In the heart of the Upper West Side of the city.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't know much about Manhattan, but she knows enough to recognize that anyone who lives there has more money than they know what to do with.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s curious though, and sees the search bar waiting in the top left corner. She taps it and a keyboard magically appears. Slowly, she types out </span>
<em>
<span>Westview National Park</span>
</em>
<span> and hits the magnifying glass and within seconds, the map zooms out and the screen is replaced by an aerial view of an area she knows too well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio holds her breath. The green on the screen looks too clean from above, the red dotted lines of the border too sharp. But still, she recognizes the area where the river flows, the lake on the far East side of the park.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her throat tightens. Somehow, she pinches in and zooms closer. The satellite view adjusts, rendering patches of cartoonish trees, rock, and trails into something almost familiar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finds the smaller river on the map that flows just near her cabin, and then she finds it. The ridge. Just across from it, is where she knows her cabin sits. Hidden under the canopy, unmarked, unnamed. There’s no icon or pin, just the faint shadow of a tree line, a slightly lighter patch where the roof might be visible if you knew where to look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s quiet, too quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The place where Nicky fell looks nothing like it does from above, but Rio knows the dangers all too well; the way the ground gave in under his weight, the sound of wind ripping through the trees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her chest tightens. She zooms in, then back out again, watching the whole stretch of forest reduce itself to shapes and shadows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the screen, it looks peaceful. Safe even, but Rio knows better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stares at the image for another long moment, trying to blink away tears she feels coming on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she swipes up from the bottom, and sees the familiar home screen. She sees an icon for a different globe in the corner and taps it, a breath of relief flooding through her when she sees the Google homepage staring back at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright you little bastard, let's see what the world really thinks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, Rio types </span>
<em>
<span>westview national park</span>
</em>
<span> and an instant flood of links fills the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tourism guides. Trail Reviews. Campground reservations. Lists of </span>
<em>
<span>must-see overlooks </span>
</em>
<span>and </span>
<em>
<span>ten wildflower trails you didn't know existed.</span>
</em>
<span> She scrolls past photos of smiling hikers and forested paths edited to look like something out of a fairytale.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then the headlines shift. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>“Lady Death: The Myth Behind Westview’s Ghost in the Trees.”</b>
</p><p>
<b>“Everything we don't know about Lady Death.”</b>
</p><p>
<b>“I survived Lady Death!”</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio briefly entertains the links and chuckles to herself by how wrong each of the articles are. Some think Lady Death is a rotation of interns, as a hazing ritual. Others believe she’s just a huge inside joke with the town. The last one is a blog post and has photos of hikers, the trails they ventured on, nowhere near where Rio used to live, and details how they spent the night and left feeling victorious that they were not visited by the entity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then one headline captures her attention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<b>Unnamed Ranger Saves CEO’s Son in Near-Fatal Fall.”</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her stomach tugs, even before she clicks. The photo attached is taken from too far away to really see anything interesting; a medevac helicopter in the clearing, dust kicking up around it. There's a blur of movement in the corner that could be anyone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio taps the headline and the full article loads.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Earlier this week, an incident occured in a more remote area of Westview National Park involving the teenage son of actor turned biotech mogul Agatha Harkness. Sources confirm the boy fell from a ledge and was rescued by an unnamed ranger on patrol who remained at the sight until medical personnel arrived. The ranger’s identity has not been released.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“What happened to my son was a tragic accident,” said Harkness briefly  in a statement outside the hospital, “but luckily this park has well-versed rangers with brain cells, and were able to act quickly. I do hope this doesn't turn people away from the beauty of the park, but read the damn signage.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She declined to answer further questions, stating only, “Please respect everyone's privacy during this time,” before returning to the hospital in the city, where the ranger is believed to be recovering.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio reads it again. And again. Like she's waiting for new information to magically appear on the screen, but it doesn't come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No name, no photo, no trail. Just a blunt quote. Agatha not only kept Rio’s name out of the press, but spoke of the park's beauty, as if trying to protect the park's reputation along with her. As if she'd known how fragile both would become, and still decided to defend them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio notes the publication date and realizes she hadn't even woken up when that statement was released.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was still unconscious. Hooked up to machines keeping her alive. Shoulder out of place, lungs barely working. She hadn't opened her eyes and Agatha was already speaking on her behalf, shutting the press out, shielding the park, shielding her. Drawing lines the world wasn't allowed to cross.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not because she had to, but because she wanted to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio locks the screen, and soon she's starting back at her own reflection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sets the tablet down next to her and leans back onto the bed with an exhausted kind of surrender. Her ribs ache, her shoulders throb, but it’s not the pain that unsettles her, it's the care. The way it keeps showing up, unannounced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the blankets folded neatly. The food is always made for her. In the medicine beside the bed. In the silence Agatha gave her, even when she didn't ask for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't know what to do with that kind of attention. It doesn't demand anything. It doesn't ask her to prove she's grateful. It just </span>
<em>
<span>is, </span>
</em>
<span>present and unflinching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that's harder to hold than the pain. Because pain sure understands. Distance, she's made a life of. But being thought of? Being looked after without being asked? </span>
</p><p>
<span>That feels like something she can't afford to want.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She presses a hand to her sternum, like she's trying to ease the ache from the inside out, but it doesn't go away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she closes her eyes. Not because she's tired, even though she is, but because if she keeps them open, she might start to believe this feeling is safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she doesn't know what to do if it is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she doesn't move, nor does she run or speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just lets herself feel it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Quietly, carefully, like it might shatter if she reaches for it too soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand stays pressed to her chest, not in pain, but to ground herself. As if holding the emotion there might keep it from spilling out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air in the room is still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, the city sounds blend with the subtle hum of the penthouse; the occasional clatter in the kitchen, Wanda's voice in the distance mixed in with Agatha’s soft laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But in the guest room, it's quiet. And eventually, the weight begins to give away to the fatigue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the kitchen, Agatha walks into Wanda reorganizing another one of her cabinets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know you don't live here right?” Agatha says flatly. “And you have a husband at home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, but someone kicked their kid out and is supposedly living with mine,” Wanda says without turning around. “There's too much testosterone going on in that place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “And this is your solution right? Replacing my entire spice system with chaos?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You had paprika next to cinnamon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re both red.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda turns to her, eyes full of judgement. “And that's how I know your mind is all over the place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs through her nose. “And where is my mind? On mars?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s down the hall, where a particularly hot ranger is laying half dead, probably googling the shit out of both of us right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha freezes. “How-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw you go back with a tablet,” Wanda says smugly. “I notice things Harkness, keep up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She asked for it,” Agatha grumbles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, and you gave it to her without making her sign an NDA for whatever top secret projects are stored on that thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, she barely knew how to work the t.v. remote when she came here,” Agatha waves off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And somehow that’s worse. It’s like you gave her a gun but didn't teach her how to aim.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not a threat,” Agatha mutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, she’s a recluse with wi-fi and questions,” Wanda says, grabbing a mug. “A dangerous combination. I wouldn't be surprised if we never see her again until dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're staying all day? Don’t you want to be dicked down by someone I’m still convinced is part robot?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda pours herself coffee. “What do you think I did all day yesterday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please don't tell me you called me mid-fuck-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not a savage,” Wanda says effortlessly. “I waited until round two.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha makes a face. “You are deeply unwell."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shrugs. “Says the woman who’s playing 18th century housewife with the world's hottest recluse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorts. “It’s called compassion, not courtship.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who would've thought that word is in the Ice Queen’s vocabulary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve thawed out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smirks. “Yeah, into someone who meal-preps for a woman who barely knows how to use a microwave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She needs calories.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You made bone broth Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs. “It was already in the freezer..”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorts. “You labeled it with the date and her initials.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It's called organization.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only a matter of time before you make space in your closet for her, she's already wearing your clothes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't flinch. “She doesn't have any of hers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not until now, half her life is packed in those bags.” Wanda nods to the duffels left by the fridge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gets up without a word and unzips one of the duffels, at the top she sees several more hoodies and flannels but doesn't make the move to dig any deeper. In the other one, she hears the crinkle of wrappers. When she opens it, she finds trail mix, granola bars, and several packets of honey-roasted peanuts. Beneath, she can see dark wood and glass she knows as picture frames.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closes them both and grabs Rio’s medication. Before she can disappear behind the corner, Wanda smiles back, knowing and smug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda doesn't even look up from her coffee. “Nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will swing one of these bags over your head and you’ll be out of work for the next six months,” Agatha taunts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You wouldn't dare.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't dignify a response, just gives a short witch cackle and keeps moving towards Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she gets to the guest room, she finds the ranger fast asleep, rather awkwardly on the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s diagonal, on her back, her legs still crossed and hand barely holding the tablet. Carefully, Agatha places the duffels near the chair, and the medication on the nightstand, and goes to remove the device from Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The screen lights up and unlocks immediately with the automatic face-id Vision installed to give her easy access for her files. Passwords are her worst enemy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What she finds on the page isn't her Wikipedia or IMDb profile, not a puff piece or gossip headline. It’s the quote she gave right outside the hospital, the one the world latched onto for thirty-six hours before moving on to something else more interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Keeping the press away from her came with whatever Agatha did, she’s used to it, but then, and even now, there's just a normal everyday person asleep on this bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No stage name, no presence for the public to pick apart every move, just Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone who saved her son without thinking. Someone who doesn't want the attention, wouldn't know what to do with it even if she had it. Someone who Agatha desperately wants to shield from the wrath of the public, and her own image.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hasn't actually thought about what happens next. If the press is still waiting for a statement, if someone's combing through hospital records, trying to piece together the identity of the unnamed ranger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hates the idea of the world once again stealing a glimpse into the life she’s worked so hard to keep private, and now that life involves Rio, whether she likes it or not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looks at Rio, still asleep, still half-frowned, as if even in her dreams she’s bracing for impact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They’d ruin her. Not just with cameras and microphones, but with curiosity, and expectations, and noise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't belong in headlines or hero-spotlights. She belongs somewhere quiet, somewhere grounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha doesn't want to be the reason Rio loses that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closes the tablet and places it face down on the nightstand next to her medication and adjusts a folded blanket over Rio’s body. She gently brushes a few strands of hair from her face, and leans in to press a soft kiss to her temple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll figure this out,” Agatha whispers to her. It’s not a promise, but a vow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, careful not to wake her, she moves quietly back to the door and lingers for a few seconds. She looks back once, before pulling it behind her with a soft click.</span>

<p>
<span>When Rio wakes up next, it’s not to the familiar scent of pine in the room, it’s to the all too familiar scent of weed wafting through the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Worry floods through her immediately. Rio doesn't know much about Agatha’s journey with drugs, but she knows whenever she smells weed, she’s on the verge of something breaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sits up faster than she’s ever done, ignoring the dull ache in her ribs and nearly forgets her cane as she stumbles down the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she gets to the living room, the scene before her is more terrifying than she’d ever imagined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda is barefoot on the coffee table, shirt off, draped in a purple floral silk robe. She's dancing in the way only an extremely stoned person would be, and Agatha is sitting by on the couch, extremely amused, arm lazily hanging over the back and a mug in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck am I looking at?” Rio asks, leaning against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh good, you're awake,” she says without missing a beat. “I’m doing an interpretive dance of what Vis and Jen did to the press while you've been busy draining all of Agatha’s social battery.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, you still haven't told me what they’ve done,” Agatha adds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But this is more fun,” Wanda whines.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay fine. Someone may have threatened someone else. HIPAA got involved and someone even fired an intern,” Wanda rambles vaguely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowns. “In English please?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What she means,” Agatha says as she places the mug on the table, “is that everything's taken care of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup,” she says, popping the ‘p’. “No one knows who you are except for one blurry photo in a helicopter. We’ve successfully renewed your trial on being the world's biggest recluse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I-” Rio starts, but she can't find the right words. Thank you? Sorry? It scares her a little just how much these strangers have done for her behind her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda doesn't give her a chance to figure it out. She waves a hand like she’s clearing fog. “Don’t worry, you're still a cryptid, but one with a whole subreddit under Agatha’s”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans back, arms crossed. “Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s Reddit?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda gasps like she’s been personally offended. “Oh my god, you really are a cryptid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She doesn't need to know,” Agatha says firmly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a message board,” she says at the same time, “for chaos, basement dwellers and conspiracy theorists who think your ranger skills means you're some kind of ranger demigod.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry- </span>
<em>
<span>what?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pinches the bridge of her nose. “Please stop talking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda ignores her completely. “There's even fan art, no one knows what you look like but some people are WILD for the things they ship Agatha with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes narrow. “Like what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda counts off her fingers. “Hot ranger, MILF of pines, Leather Daddy of the Forest, some even think you’re a dude.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks. “I- excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The internet’s confused and horny,” Wanda says, waving a hand. “I’ve been helping, obviously”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrows her eyes. “Helping?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fueling rumors,” she says grinning. “Just… not the right ones. I’ve steered at least four threads away from the truth. Threw in a fake ex, hinted you were a model in Budapest, really kept them guessing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would you do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To protect you, obviously. Nothing distracts the masses like a juicy fake love triangle. You’re welcome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stares. “You invented a fake relationship for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shrugs. “Hey, it's more action than you’re getting now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chokes on air. Agatha doesn't hesitate to grab the nearest pillow and hurls it at Wanda’s head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She catches it effortlessly and hugs it like a prize. “Violent and sexy, I’ll add it to the rumors.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groans, heading to the kitchen. “I hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Love you too. Bring back snacks or I’m leaking your audition tape!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio makes eye contact with Agatha, who’s mock annoyed but a smile is tugging at her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be honest,” Rio says, tilting her head slightly, “do I stand a good fight against this fake girlfriend of yours?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums, pretending to think. “Well… she’s elegant, insanely hot, European, speaks three languages, owns a vineyard.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raises an eyebrow. “... and?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans in just enough. “She’s also fictional and allergic to nature. So yeah, I think you've got a shot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grins. “Good to know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turns back toward the kitchen, voice soft but pointed. “She doesn't make my heart race either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio can answer, Wanda’s voice cuts through the room like a cannon blast. “IF YOU TWO DON’T STOP MAKING OUT, I’M PLAYING AGATHA EDITS ON TIKTOK.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groans. “She’s insufferable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabs the popcorn, shaking her head. “How the hell did Robert marry her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales a laugh. “No one knows. We think he was cursed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They turn the corner back into the living room and stop dead in their tracks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s is perched in the middle of the couch, robe loosely tied, legs criss crossed, holding the TV remote in front of her like it’s sacred. Then, with zero shame, she shoves it straight down the front of her pants and leans back like she’s settling into a throne.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groans instantly. “Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grins, eyes closed. “I’m channeling the inner narrative.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks. “Are you trying to use the remote as a dildo?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda cracks one eye open. “It’s not the worst thing I’ve used to get off. One time-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do NOT finish that sentence,” Agatha cuts in, pointing a finger like a warning flare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda throws her hands up dramatically. “You two need to get laid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You put the remote down your pants,” Rio says flatly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And now it's synced with the storyline,” Wanda says, as if that explains anything. She pulls it out with a flourish and presses play. She forces herself over to the edge of the couch, effectively forcing Agatha and Rio to sit next to each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The screen flickers with flashes of comic book panels and dramatic orchestral music. Eventually it zooms out and Rio’s seen with a ton of familiar looking characters on the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait-” Rio squints. “Is this Marvel?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda whips her head towards Rio. “You know Marvel but you don’t know what Reddit is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs. “My parents had a ton of comics in their house growing up.” She then has a look of surprise on her face, she doesn't even know how she knows that, but she doesn't feel like being watched like a caged animal at the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda ignores the reaction, or misses it entirely. Who knows, mentally she’s halfway to another planet. “Have you seen anything they’ve created for the big screen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilts her head. “It’s possible, blame it on the amnesia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unbelievable, you’ve missed out on some of my greatest works,” Wanda groans, but hits resume and turns the volume up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The title continues playing and then fades to a black and white logo, something straight out of the 1950’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first thing on the screen is a black and white video with a totally-real-for-the-time period jingle and picture of a car, with Wanda with the biggest theatrical smile on her face next to someone who looks vaguely familiar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t tell me Robert was in this as well,” Rio says, shocked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nah, it’s his twin. His parents fully Parent Trap’d him. I was surprised when I showed up to the set and Paul was there. I thought Vis was surprising me,” Wanda adds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>A newlywed couple moved to town.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On the screen, Paul picks Wanda up bridal style and brings them into their home, but she falls flat on her ass as he disappears behind the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stares wide-eyed. “What the fuck is going on? Why does this feel like someone spiked the Dick Van Dyke show with LSD?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda tosses popcorn like she’s at the theater. “Art, baby. You’re watching the greatest fever dream to ever hit television.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio keeps watching, transfixed yet horrified. “Oh god, there’s a laugh track.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was live,” Agatha mutters, sinking further into the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The opening song continues and Rio knows something immediately is weird when Paul walks straight through a chair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, they used your real name for this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perks of contract negotiations,” Wanda says cheerfully. “Total accident, no one cared. I leaned into it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re telling me you’ve been playing the Scarlet Witch?” Rio turns, completely baffled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda spreads her arms wide. “Surprise! Traumatized sorceress with reality-warping powers. Art imitates life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks over at Agatha, deadpan. “And you signed off on this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t move. “I was contractually obligated and emotionally blackmailed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“By </span>
<span>her</span>
<span>?” Rio gestures to the screen, where Wanda is now controlling the dishes in the kitchen with her magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, by </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha says, pointing to the real Wanda beside her, who is grinning like the devil incarnate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, I’ve always wanted to work with you, just so happened the perfect role came along,” Wanda supplies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The scene continues and Rio genuinely laughs at the acting. It’s just like the shows she used to watch with her parents growing up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh I don’t eat food.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is your husband a robot?” Rio asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda doesn’t miss a beat. “Yes. When we’re done with this we’re watching Age of Ultron, it’ll explain a lot. Now hush.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opens her mouth to respond, then just shuts it again, eyebrows high. “I don’t know what any of those words mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groans softly. “And we were having such a nice day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda tosses popcorn in her direction. “This </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> a nice day. I’m educating your forest cryptid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slumps back on the couch and mutters, “I should’ve stayed in bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips twitch. “You say that like you’re not enjoying this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m enduring it,” she corrects.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re smiling,” Rio points out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s muscle fatigue.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda cackles. “That’s gay panic, babe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio sees Agatha appear on screen, her jaw is on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are- are you flirting with Wanda?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't even look up “I’m getting a joint.” She grabs her mug and disappears into the kitchen then her office like she’s diving into witness protection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Grab me an edible!” Rio says as Agatha clicks the door shut.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“How to Goose Your Wife So You Don't Lose Your Wife.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stares at Agatha on-screen. “What the absolute fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Comedy,” Wanda says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m watching historical lesbian propaganda disguised as comedy,” Rio mutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grins, “and we said this on Disney too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not helping!” Agatha yells from the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t care!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha returns a few moments later, slightly disheveled carrying Rio’s antibiotics, a small foil packet and a white bracelet. The joint dangles from her lips like it’s the only thing tethering to her sanity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Catch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gently tosses the foil packet and the pill bottle towards Rio, who can't and doesn't catch them. They land in her lap staring up at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Antibiotics first. Only reason I’m even considering this is because I know the painkillers make you sleepy and you're not leaving me alone with this one over here,” Agatha points to Wanda as she takes the lighter off the coffee table. She lights the joint then settles back into the couch, pulling a blanket over herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dry swallows the pill and opens the foil packet with her teeth, eyebrow raised when she sees a chocolate square inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Half right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unless you want to be on the same planet as Wanda right now, only take a bite,” Agatha instructs, fitting the blanket over the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio does as she’s told and throws the bar onto the table. She readjusts her sling carefully before putting her good arm underneath the fabric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s already reclined back into the cushions, joint still lit in her hands. Before she can take another hit, Wanda steals it from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, get your own,” Agatha mutters but doesn't move when she feels Rio curl into her side next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda holds the joint away from her and takes a long drag, before handing it back to her. “Sharing is caring Harkness, except for your cryptid ranger, you can keep her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, get up for two seconds,” Agatha says. Rio groans dramatically but listens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally leans forward for the white bracelet on the table and holds it up expectantly for Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is a biometrics bracelet, designed for post-op patients,” Agatha starts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don't trust me to tell you when something's wrong?” Rio teases.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “Do you really want me to answer that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs a breathless laugh but hears the subtext. A part of her tries to repress the sting of basically hearing </span>
<em>
<span>I don’t trust you</span>
</em>
<span>, but she sticks out her arm anyways.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha fastens it gently against Rio’s extremely thin wrist and hits a button. It glows purple for a brief second then the color fades. “You won't notice it, but it's just… peace of mind while your body's relaxing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knows realistically that’s all it is, just a precaution. But something about it feels like a shift, not backwards, not forward, just a new boundary drawn between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bathtub memory flashes uninvited in her brain. Agatha's panicked voice, the way Rio completely shut down afterwards. Rio hadn't meant to scare her, but she did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe Agatha's right to be cautious. Still, something about the warmth in her tone, the gentleness in her hands, it spoke volumes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe in return Rio can finally open up to her, or maybe that's just the edible talking. Time will tell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The episode continues on and Rio’s attention is back on the television.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she watches Agnes and Wanda prepare for some event happening later that evening, she can feel the effects of the edible kick in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her body starts to warm around the edges, the oversized leather cushions on the couch swallowing her in a way that feels less like sinking and more like being wrapped in something safe. She doesn't know where the couch ends and Agatha begins. Though her limbs are heavy and pleasantly sluggish, her mind stays sharp, focused on the show in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop it,” Mrs. Hart says over and over again when her husband stops choking on his food. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why is she not helping her husband?” Rio asks, a quiet pause between each of her words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s a dick clearly,” Agatha says, tone dry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches the scene unfold on the screen, and even looks to Wanda expectantly, who has been oddly quiet now. She's got the kind of high where everything feels far away and too close, her eyelids half closed, a hand lazily draped over her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda, what the fuck?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hush, it's just getting good,” she says, sinking further into the couch like she's now a part of the upholstery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the scene ends, Rio’s left dumbfounded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Calling it right now,” Rio says pointing to the please stand by screen. “Wanda’s controlling it but doesn't know she is. Agnes is probably the bad guy but the town thinks she's good. The ending… I have no idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a soft snort. “We’ll see toots.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scrunches her nose. “Okay. No. Absolutely never say that again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? You don't like charming sitcom alter ego?” Agatha grins, clearly pleased with herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gives her a look. “No, she makes me uncomfortable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, half asleep under the blanket mutters, “you should've seen her in rehearsal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don't even know what that means, but I hate it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans in slightly, voice lower. “You hate how much you like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glares at her but her ears turn slightly pink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep talking and I Google both of you right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do it, I dare you,” Wanda says, unashamed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too much effort to get up,” Rio mutters, slouching deeper into the couch and by extension Agatha’s side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't move. If anything, she adjusts to make more room, her arm brushing against Rio’s without comment. Beneath the blanket her hand finds a place just above Rio’s knee, causing her breath to hitch slightly, but she relaxes into the touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next episode starts and Rio notes the decade change, but still black and white. The aspect ratio is different. The music’s changed. The intro is more animated, goofier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lets out a quiet giggle when Vision chews gum by mistake and it gets stuck inside his inner mechanical gears during the animated breakdown. It’s so absurd that she can't help herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god,” she whispers, half-laughing. “He’s drunk on gum.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorts softly under the blanket, still mostly asleep. “That was a fun day on set.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s thumb brushes over Rio’s knee subtly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't say anything about it, but her smile lingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sit like that throughout the rest of the series, sunk into the couch as daylight fades behind the blinds. Wanda falls asleep somewhere in the middle curled up in the far corner of the couch, her usual chaos reduced to the occasional mumble that neither of them can make out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stays quiet through most of it. She watches each episode unfold without interruption, her eyes steady, focused. The magical pregnancy still makes no sense to her, and by now she’s stopped trying to understand it. But when the screen turns to color and the style of the show changes, she leans forward without realizing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the Agnes/Agatha reveals hits, she freezes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The montage plays out with flair and full commitment. The song is catchy, really catchy and Rio has a feeling it won’t leave her head for a while.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The final note hits and she turns to Agatha next to her. “Was that… your real voice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums lightly, somewhere between amused and grim. “Yep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a soft huff. “Damn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It went viral overnight,” Agatha says, almost like she’s bored with the fact now. But there’s something behind her voice, something harder to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t push. She watches the rest in silence. She doesn’t make jokes or ask anymore questions. While she’s more entertained than she ever expected to be, she can’t stop thinking about what it must’ve felt like for Agatha when the cameras stopped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sees it now. Why people latched on, and the internet spiraled. Agatha was undeniably good, a scene stealer and arguably a better plot line than the Wanda’s family storyline.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the series finishes, all she says to Agatha is, “You were the best part.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t answer right away, but she shifts closer, slightly, as if she needed to be protected from her own memories after the show was aired.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The screen has gone dark now, and Wanda stirs as the end credits roll, groaning softly as she lifts her head from the armrest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did I miss the finale?” she asks, voice thick with sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t look away from the screen. “You missed a lot of things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda yawns and stretches, blinking slowly as she surveys the two of them. Ro is half-curled into Agatha’s side, Agatha unusually still, eyes distant but sharp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pauses, then mutters, “Great, you both look like you watched your own funeral.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorts under her breath but doesn’t argue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio speaks for both of them. “It was good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda perks up a little. “The show?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolls her eyes. “No, the existential crisis it triggered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grins sleepily. “Told you, it’s art.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t say anything, but her fingers twitch slightly under the blanket, just enough for Rio to notice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shifts, stretching again with a grunt, then grabs the remote and scrolls through the options. “Okay, you watched my grief spiral, now you get to see the beginning of the love story,” she says, clicking on Age of Ultron.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Marvel logo flares on screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushes the blanket off of her and fixes it subtly over Rio, rising slowly and smoothing her shirt like it’s armor. “I’ll be back in a bit,” she says, voice steady but quieter than normal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Wanda asks without looking up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” she says, already heading toward the hall. “I just need to shower, and wake up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her disappear down the hall, the echo of her presence still lingering beside her on the couch. Then, she turns to Wanda. “Do you always watch your own stuff?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shrugs, eyes on the screen. “Sometimes. Depends on the mood.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raises an eyebrow. “And tonight’s mood is…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grabs a handful of cold popcorn and leans back. “Mildly nostalgic with a hint of emotional self-sabotage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorts. “Wow. That’s healthy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grins. “Says the woman who watched a whole TV series in one sitting and forgot how to blink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilts her head, considering. “Fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The opening sequence starts to roll. Neither of them says anything for a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She okay?” Rio asks after a bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s smirk softens. “With you here, she will be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t respond right away. Just nods, slow and thoughtful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But her eyes keep drifting back toward the hall where Agatha disappeared, wondering if she’s okay as she hears the low hum of the shower coming from her bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha returns, her hair is damp and swept back, and she’s changed into an oversized faded purple hoodie and leggings. She moves slower now, towel still in one hand, the edges of exhaustion catching in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pauses in the doorway when she sees Rio still curled on the couch, blanket draped across her lap, legs tucked up. Wanda’s slouched on the far end, scrolling through something on her phone with a knowing smirk already forming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re still up,” Agatha says, a little surprised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, one arm pressed to her ribs. “Didn’t feel like going anywhere.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda doesn’t look up. “She was waiting for you like a sad little Victorian housewife.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio refuses to make eye contact with either of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? It’s cute. All that yearning and unresolved tension.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorts, walking further into the room. “I was gone for twenty minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Twenty minutes too long,” she drawls dramatically. “She practically wilted in your absence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolls her eyes but doesn’t argue. The edible has made her too warm, too honest in her stillness. And maybe, Wanda’s not wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sits beside her on the arm rest, careful of her shoulder. Rio shifts just slightly, enough o lean in but not enough to be obvious about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda watches like a cat waiting to pounce.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously, though,” she says, “you two are worse than a slow burn fanfic. I can feel the tension from a mile away. I half expect one of you to get struck by lightning and confess under a tree.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groans. “Wanda, shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda ignores her entirely, grin growing sharper. “Oh, come on. One of you sighs every time the other leaves the room. The other stares like she’s memorizing your soul. It’s torturous for me to watch. I just want to fast forward to the climax.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sinks a little deeper into the couch. “I’m too high for this conversation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha mutters, “You’d be too high for this conversation sober.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raises her eyebrows. “I’m just saying what everyone else is thinking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s no one else here,” Rio says flatly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Wanda chirps. “And yet, I speak for the people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales sharply, rubbing the towel over her face before tossing it to the side. “Wanda, I swear-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda throws her hands up dramatically. “What? You’re both circling each other like emotionally repressed hawks! It’s exhausting! Just kiss or pine in separate rooms like normal people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks like she’s seriously weighing the consequences of launching the throw pillow again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally speaks, her voice a little hoarse, but dry. “Are you leaving soon, or do I need to throw myself off the balcony?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grins. “Your ribs won’t survive the fall. And besides, don’t you want me to witness your big romantic revelation?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stands. “Nope. I’m calling your husband.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda clutches her imaginary pearls. “Wow. First sign of intimacy and you kick me out. Rude.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s already pulling her phone out, halfway to finding Vision’s contact. “How fast can he get here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s phone buzzes. “He’s already here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gives her a long, flat look. “Of course he is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda makes her way to the elevator at a leisurely pace, throwing her coat on with a flourish. “You’re both welcome, by the way. I’ve planted the seeds. Now go water them with your feelings or whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She steps into the elevator. “I expect a progress report,” she calls, then disappears behind the closing doors before either of them can respond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence stretches in her absence, warm and awkward and a little too loud. Rio leans her head back against the couch cushions, closing her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stays standing for a second before sinking down beside her, slow and careful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a moment, she says gently. “She’s not wrong, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a breath through her nose. “Please, just not right now”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, eyes forward. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sit like that for a while. Close, but not touching. The unspoken sitting between them like a third person in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts slightly, wincing as the motion pulls at her ribs. “She always like that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice is quiet. “Only when she cares.”</span>

<p>
<span>In the aftermath of Wanda’s visit, things change in the penthouse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s no follow-up conversation about the things she stirred up, just a quiet acknowledgement, visible only in the way silence now settles differently between them. The space feels less tense, less rehearsed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They don’t name it, they don’t have to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s in the way Rio doesn’t flinch when Agatha brushes past her on the way to the kitchen. In the way Agatha no longer hesitates before asking if she’s okay. The air between them has softened, becoming more lived in. Something opens up, and neither of them are in a rush to close it again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't bring up the show again, and Agatha doesn’t offer anything more. But something in the weight of their glances now says they both know it meant something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The mornings start to feel different. Rio wakes a little earlier and not just from the lingering stiffness in her ribs or the dull ache in her shoulder. There’s a quiet alertness to her own, a sense that she’s listening to the world instead of bracing against it. The sling no longer lives on her like it used to; it hangs by the closet now, used only when needed. The cane helps her navigate longer distances, especially on bad days, but around the penthouse, she moves mostly without it. Slower than she’s used to, but steadier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The physical therapy sessions have begun to reshape her. Her grip is stronger. Her breath doesn’t catch the way it used to. Some days, she even forgets to notice the pain until it taps her on the shoulder hours later. She’s still healing. But she’s not just surviving anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha returns to work in a more steady routine, though she’s still working part time to make herself available for anything that Rio needs. Sometimes Agatha’s already in the kitchen when she comes out, barefoot and half-distracted with something on her laptop, making coffee like she’s done it her whole life, like Rio isn’t there to begin with. Sometimes, she’s still asleep and Rio wakes to an empty living area. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On those mornings, Rio’s at her most vulnerable. She’s glad she’s making progress, but soon enough she’ll have to think about the next steps. Does she go back to Westview? She knows she doesn’t have the strength to hike the way she used to, but the idea of staying in the city long-term makes her stomach twist. The noise, the concrete, the sense that everything is always moving faster than she can keep up with, it never felt like hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she’s not sure if Agatha's penthouse, with its tall windows and quiet corners, feels like hers either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The duffel bags that Wanda brought with her remains in the guest room. She unpacked one of them and started to wear her own clothes again, but they felt foreign to her. The other that holds her memories, has sat untouched. It’s not that she’s afraid of her memories, she just hasn’t decided who she is with them yet. </span>
<span>She’s not in a rush to get her memories back, some come naturally, others don’t. </span>
<span>Sometimes they surface in the middle of doing something, peeling an orange, or hearing the sound of wind against the window. A scent, a word, the shape of the mountain skyline in the corner of her mind, but they’re fragments, not foundations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s learning to live with the space between what she remembers and what she’s still trying to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>One morning, a particularly bad migraine keeps Rio in bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It creeps in slowly, blooming behind her eyes and wrapping around her skull like a vice. Even with the curtains drawn, the light that seeps through feels sharp, like a blade across her vision. Her arm is tucked close to her chest, the rest of her cocooned in the blankets, still and quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t hear Agatha come in at first, but she does hear the faint thump of something hopping against the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cracks one eye open. There, perched near the foot of the bed, is a rabbit. White with light brown spots, fluffy and entirely unbothered by the silence of the room. He sniffs once, then hops up closer to Rio’s pillows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What,” Rio rasps, “is that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice follows a second later, soft and amused from the doorway. “That is Señor Scratchy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks slowly. “You have a rabbit?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Technically, he has me,” Agatha says, stepping inside with a mug in one hand and a water bottle in the other. “He’s been with Nicky this whole time, but he just dropped him off this morning before fall break.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That makes Rio’s head spin. “Fall break?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pauses, like she hadn’t realized how that might land. “Yeah. It’s October 11th.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts slightly under the blankets, a slow, careful movement. Her eyes stay fixed on the ceiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t realize it’d been that long."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sets the water on the nightstand, her voice gentler now. “Time’s been a little weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t answer right away. She just lets that settle in her chest. The weight of how far she’s come, and how much she’s still circling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nearby, Señor Scratchy hops closer and thumps once against the bed frame, like he’s reminding them both to stay present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want me to leave him in here with you or take him out?” Agatha asks tentatively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhales a quiet breath. “He can stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gives a small nod. “He’ll probably poke around your bags for the snacks that are in there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flick to the corner of the room, where one of the duffels sits still zipped. “Let him. Maybe he’ll find something I can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t push on that. Just offers a soft, knowing hum.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lingers for a moment longer, fingers brushing the rim of the water glass. “It’s okay if you stay in bed today, not like you have responsibilities elsewhere. Jen said to call her if it lasts into tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts slightly under the blankets. “Would you stay? Just for a bit?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks at her for a moment, surprised by the quiet vulnerability in the request. Then, she gives a single nod and without hesitation slips off her shoes before easing carefully onto the bed beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her settle, then she shifts slowly until her head finds its way into Agatha’s lap. It’s an instinct more than a decision, and when Agatha doesn't flinch, she exhales like she’s been holding her breath all morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifts her hand, then gently brings it down onto Rio’s hair, her fingers curling softly into her somewhat greasy hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closes her eyes, then softly, “Jen… the doctor who treated me the first hospital round?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, her voice quiet. “Yeah. She checks in every so often. Wants updates.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks, slowly processing that. “You’ve been talking to her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn't exactly have a choice,” Agatha says with a faint shrug. “She was at the hospital when you coded, kept me from doing something stupid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tenses up, the weight of the words hitting harder than she expects. “You never told me that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers still, the memory still fresh in her mind. “There wasn't a good time.” Her fingers curl again, slower this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s quiet for a beat, then murmurs, “What actually happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales. It’s not entirely a sigh, but more like she’s bracing for impact. “You stopped me and Nicky, then you started coughing. It sounded rough… but then it wouldn't stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pauses. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When the blood came up, everything shifted. I sent Nicky to get the car. I stayed with you. You were barely holding on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice softens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just kept talking. Trying to keep you awake. I don't even remember what I said.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A longer beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When we got to the hospital, they took you in right away. You didn't have a pulse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers curl again, slower. A silent tear rolling down her cheek as she pushes through the memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Four minutes. You were gone for four minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breathing stays steady as she tries to imagine it - Agatha, a stranger then, fighting to keep her awake, trying to hold her together while her body gave out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It doesn't make sense, but it happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallows. “That must've been terrifying."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't respond right away. Her hand keeps moving, slow and steady through Rio’s hair, like it’s the only thing anchoring her in the present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was,” she admits softly. “I haven't been that scared since Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words settle between them. They land harder than anything Wanda could've thrown at them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You barely knew me,” Rio says, voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn't have to. It wasn't about how long I’d known you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closes her eyes. “Then what was it about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn't look at me like everyone else does. Hell, you had no idea who I was,” she says quietly, almost with a breath of disbelief. “You weren’t intimidated, or trying to impress me. Granted you were half dead, but you just looked at me like I was a person… I didn’t realize how much I missed that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t speak, but something in her expression softens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And when you collapsed,” Agatha continues, “it wasn’t about logic. I just knew I had to get you help.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts, bringing her arm out of the blanket and placing it gently on Agatha’s leg.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t trying to scare you,” she says quietly. “Not then, not the day I came here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stills, instantly knowing what Rio’s referencing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The bathtub.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers resume, gentler now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha says, barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice is steadier than she feels. “I just… didn’t want to feel anything for a while. I didn’t want to die, I just needed everything to stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales slowly, her other hand settling over Rio’s where it rests on her leg. “You don’t have to explain it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I do. You found me. You pulled me out. You stayed even after what came after.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t need to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks up at her, eyes tired open. “I thought you’d be angry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shakes her head. “No. I was scared. But never angry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t scare me, Rio,” she says softly. “Losing you did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t respond right away, just blinks slowly, like the weight of the conversation is finally starting to settle in her bones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezes her hand gently. “You don’t have to stay awake for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips part like she wants to argue, but the words don’t come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rest, I’m not going anywhere,” she says, brushing a strand of hair from her forehead. The only sound in the room is the soft chitter of Señor Scratchy, and Rio’s breathing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The duffel bags don't get addressed for another few days.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Each morning, Rio wakes to them just sitting in the corner, waiting. LIke it knows she’ll come to them when she’s ready.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One evening, she finally does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s curled on the couch with Señor Scratchy, a blanket draped over her legs, eyes zoned out on the television in front of her. When Rio walks out, bags in hand, she raises an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s about damn time,” she teases, nudging the rabbit aside. “I’ve been wondering what was in these things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too,” Rio says, placing the duffels on the floor nearby. Agatha lowers the volume on the television and settles opposite Rio, back leaning against the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio unzips the top compartment on the first one and the scent of genuine pine wafts through the space. On top of everything, she finds several flannels. She takes each of them out and holds them up like she just opened a gift on Christmas morning. Some look familiar, some don't. Those that aren’t, are larger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think these belonged to my parents,” Rio says. She reaches further down and pulls out a thicker flannel. It’s green plaid and fur lined, and still has pieces of her father’s cologne sprinkled into the material.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Next, she pulls out a ragged Westview High School hoodie that is about two sizes too big for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m stealing that,” Agatha says. Rio hands it over willingly, and she immediately throws it over her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiles faintly as Agatha wrestles her arms through the hoodie sleeves. It swallows her, the hem falling almost to her thighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looks good,” Rio says, loving the sight of Agatha in her clothes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I look like a teenage burnout,” Agatha says, tugging the sleeves down past her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look cozy,” Rio corrects.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Deeper in the bag, there's a plastic baggie holding a bundle of polaroids together. Rio removes them and spreads them out on the table. Most of them are just of nature, but there are a few that have team photos of Westview National Park employees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only recognizes two of them: Lilia and Alice. The rest are up for debate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks through the stack and immediately takes one out, hiding it in the pocket of the hoodie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was that?” Rio asks, peeling her eyes away from the rest of the duffel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a horrible liar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just- ugh fine. But keep in mind this was thirty years ago and I was in college.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She flips over the polaroid and in it is a photo of Agatha much younger, standing next to a shack in cowboy boots, jorts and a huge oversized Westview National Park button down donned with a cowboy hat. She’s standing like she was the epitome of rock bottom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks. Then blinks again. “What is this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groans, dragging her hands over her face. “Humiliation in its physical form.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio starts laughing, really laughing, the sound bright and unexpected. “You look like a fish out of water. Jorts, cowboy boots, </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> a cowboy hat? Who styled you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I lost a bet,” Agatha says flatly, already regretting every life decision that led to that moment. “I can't believe Lilia kept that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turns the photo over, snorting softly at the scribbled note. “</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha Harkness March ‘93, proof she once had fun.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I don't know what the hell happened on this trip, but if this is the only time you've ever had fun then I have questions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, “It wasn't even planned.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raises an eyebrow. “What was it then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“College spring break. Wanda Jen and I packed a car and just drove, we broke down in Westview and couldn't afford the repair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grins now. “Let me guess, manual labor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course. Wanda spent the week flirting with Vision more than helping and you can see how that went.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs a laugh. “Sounds like her."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen got stuck helping Dottie at the clinic, hated every second of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dottie? The doctor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The one and only. She says she'd rather be hit by a car than have to hear her break HIPAA one more time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chokes on a laugh. “Oh my god.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She called me at midnight asking how to fake a fever bad enough to get reassigned.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio holds up the photo. “God Nicky’s movie is going to be interesting. And you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Trail signage. Trash collection. Lilia gave me a toothbrush and a garbage picker and said ‘Let’s see if sarcasm can get that clean.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head, smiling. “She read you immediately.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She always does.” Agatha shrugs. “By day three I was wearing this cursed button down, covered in bug bites and somehow that cowboy hat ended up on my head.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look like you lost a bet with the woods.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I did,” she mutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flips the photo again, reading the faded ink. Then softly, she says, “You don't look like you hated it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice loses its edge. “I didn't, not really. I think it was the first time I ever had fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn't respond right away. Her fingers trace the edge of the photo. She looks at it, then back at Agatha with something gentler behind her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look relaxed,” Rio says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs lightly. “My life hasn't been easy, but Westview was like a breath of fresh air.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re lucky Lilia didn't put you on sewer duty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks. “She tried. I bribed her with granola bars.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorts. “You're such a menace.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're lucky I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinks like she only just registered what she said. Her eyes go wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifts her eyebrows, half a smile still on her lips. “What?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That wasn't- just don't make it a thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kind of already is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rubs the back of her neck. “It just slipped out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you meant it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha meets her gaze. “Yeah, I did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rises slowly, stepping around the coffee table, and leans in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She kisses her. It’s soft, brief, real. More grounding than any artifact in any of those bags.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she pulls back, her voice is low, but warm. “Ask a girl on a date first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales, eyes a little wide. “Will you go on a date with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods. “Took you long enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kisses her again, quicker this time, then sits down next to Agatha on the rug and tucks the photo under her leg.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches her, lips curling into a smile. “You know,” she says, nudging Rio’s leg with her knee, “there were other things going on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks. “Like you rearranging your entire life around me without asking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales, wry. “You know, you nearly dying. Twice. And also everything that came after that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs softly, but her smile doesn’t fade. “Still sounds like overachieving to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They don’t say anything else for a moment. They just sit there, warmth spreading throughout their bodies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, Rio shifts toward the second duffel. It’s heavier. She unzips it slowly, sifting through several packages of granola bars and honey-roasted peanuts, until her hand brushes something flat, carefully wrapped in plastic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She goes still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha notices it immediately. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulls it out gently. A large photograph, protected in a cloudy sleeve. The backing board is cracked, but the image inside is untouched. Her breath catches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s her, at sixteen or seventeen, standing in front of the ranger station between her parents. Her dad is mid-laugh, her mom is holding a thermos, and Rio is in the middle of them both. Her hair is flowing freely in the wind, she’s sunburned slightly and she’s beaming like she hadn’t yet learned what it meant to lose them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stares at it, the edges of her world narrowing to the frame in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifts beside her. “Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice is so quiet, it barely registers. “I almost forgot what they looked like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t look up, just keeps her eyes on the image, her thumb brushing along the cloudy sleeve like she could memorize their faces again by touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw them,” she says, “in the coma. Or I think I did. It felt so real, but I didn’t know for sure when I woke up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinks hard, like she’s trying to focus on the present. “I wasn’t sure if it was just my subconscious projecting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stays still, waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally exhales, shaky. “But this… this is real.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers hover, then settles over the glass, right where her dad’s hand rests on her shoulder in the image.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I forgot how warm they looked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice cracks, but she doesn’t cry, not fully. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sets the frame gently on the coffee table, turning it so it faces them both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches her for a moment, then wraps an arm slowly around Rio’s back gently. Rio doesn’t pull away. She leans in, gradually then all at once. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulls her into her arms. It’s not an urgent pull. There’s no fixing that needs to be done, just the kind of holding that says ‘I’m here, I’m not going anywhere.’</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rests her face against her shoulder, eyes closed but breathing steady. “I’m okay,” she murmurs. “I just-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” she says softly. “You don’t have to explain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Rio pulls back just slightly, enough to look up at her. Her voice is quieter now, but dry. “God you’re an idiot for loving me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out the smallest breath of a laugh. “Probably.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hugs, not quite laughing at herself, but close. “You don’t even deny it now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head and leans in again, pressing her forehead to Agatha’s collarbone. “You could’ve picked someone easier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice is soft, but sure. “I’m not the easiest myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That draws a breath from Rio, part exhale, part something unspoken. She doesn’t pull away, and Agatha doesn’t let go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They just sit there, past and present spread out around them.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>They’d decided to wait on the date until Rio decided she could feel more herself, and now the time has come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio retired the cane a few weeks after Nicky’s spring break ended, and despite his protests, Agatha insisted they keep Señor Scratchy with her and Rio as a companion for when Agatha got swamped with business calls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She still hasn’t returned to work full time, but as Rio’s body healed more, Rio pushed for Agatha to return to her empire, not because she’s pushing Agatha away, but because she knows that somewhere out there, some person is going to benefit from the technology she and Vision are working on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Besides, the spare time gives Rio some time to breathe and come to terms with everything she’s experienced in the past three months, and to finally address that ever looming question of what she wants to do when she fully recovers - when she can go home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If home still feels like home at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hasn’t left the penthouse since the fall, though she spends a fair amount of time in the terrace bundled up in blankets just breathing in the fresh air, or city fresh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not the same as Westview, the quiet that is. Instead of the birds chirping, it's the faint hum of traffic below with the occasional siren slicing through the atmosphere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Overtime, even that becomes its own type of stillness. Predictable, distant enough that Rio can tune it out and for a brief moment, close her eyes and pretend she’s barefoot on her cabin porch with a steaming mug of coffee in hand with the sharp scent of pines cutting through the morning air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course it isn’t home, but she’s starting to realize that maybe </span>
<em>
<span>where</span>
</em>
<span> she heals doesn't matter as </span>
<em>
<span>who</span>
</em>
<span> is around her while she does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren't you cold?” Agatha asks from the sliding door, wrapping her own cardigan around herself as she steps out. Of course she’s in Rio’s hoodie, she’s barely taken it off since they went through her duffels. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulls the blanket tighter around her shoulders. “Not really,” she says. “I like the air this time of year.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums quietly. “What do you do when it’s winter and the snow comes?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The park closes down around now, I usually go back to my parents’ house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods and takes a seat on the arm of the chair Rio’s sitting in. “Do you ever stay through the winter?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sometimes, if the weather's not too bad. I’ll stay until the first big storm hits, but once the snow piles up, it’s not worth the risk. The Roads’ too dangerous once the path ices over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good to know you weren't always so reckless.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Watch it, I saved your son from a very dangerous ridge. Sue me for not tying a knot perfectly once”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was referring to your stubborn refusal for both the cane and the sling for a week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs, leaning back in the chair. “I didn't refuse… I just selectively ignored them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gives her a flat look, but her eyes are warm. “Selective ignoring isn't the same as recovering."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You kicking me out already?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile softens. “Hardly, you're the one that asked me to stay, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs a quiet laugh. “I had amnesia and was confused why a stranger was crying at my bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile shifts to something crooked. “I wasn't crying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes you were. You were hysterical.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs, half-laughing despite herself. “I was not hysterical.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The nurse literally put you in time out,” Rio says, looking Agatha directly in the eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course now you have a perfect memory.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks. “It’s still not all back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That softens something in Agatha immediately. The teasing fades just slightly as her gaze lingers on Rio’s face, searching for any kind of strain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything you're still missing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs under the blanket. “Nothing worth remembering at this point. If it comes it comes, if it doesn't…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She trails off, leaving the thought unfinished, but Agatha understands what she means.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don't have to make peace with it yet,” she says softly. “You're allowed to still be angry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not angry,” Rio’s voice stays even, almost convincing. Her eyes shift to the glass skyline. “Not anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches her for a moment, like she doesn't fully believe it but knows better than to push. She just reaches out, fingers brushing against Rio’s wrist where it rests.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” she murmurs. “Whether it comes back or not, you're still here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances at her, eyes soft. “Yeah,” she says quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air between them feels fuller again, like they're both just standing just at the edge of something bigger, something neither of them are quite ready to name just yet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The next morning is finally the weekend, a day where Agatha can truly forget about her flooded inbox. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Today is special though. She can finally take Rio out on a date. Although she hates the circumstance in which they met, she can't help but be grateful for fate, or whatever twisted version of it, bright Rio into her orbit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moves quietly through the penthouse, careful not to disturb the rare calm of the morning. The city glows faintly beyond the tall windows with the soft November light spilling through. She makes sure to feed Señor Scratchy before double checking the bag she packed the night before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Blanket, check. Thermos, check. Rio’s medication (just in case), check. Snacks Rio will pretend not to want, check.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She takes a breath, glancing toward the hallway where Rio is still getting ready. There’s a nervous buzz under her skin. Strange, considering all they've already been through together. But this is different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is intentional; a choice and a weight that is heavier than she expects.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The soft sound of footsteps pulls her attention, and she turns to Rio as she enters the room, pulling on her fathers jacket. Her movements are careful, but steadier now than they have been in months.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're up early,” Rio greets, voice still warm from sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles, smoothing her cardigan. “Had a few things to finish.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mean obsess over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arches a brow. “I prefer ‘prepare.’ Besides, Señor gets irritated if I don't feed him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure blame it on the rabbit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs a small laugh. “He has standards.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grins as she adjusts the collar of her jacket. “You really didn't have to make a big deal out of today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not a big deal,” Agatha says easily, though the careful way she triple-checks the bag on the counter says otherwise. “It’s just… the first date I’ve been looking forward to in a very long time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her for a beat, the teasing softening into something quieter. “You're nervous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m prepared,” Agatha corrects, slipping the strap of the bag over her shoulder. “There’s a difference.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifts a brow, amused. “Sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales, but there's a smile tugging at her mouth. “I just want it to go well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It will.” Rio steps towards her, grounding the words with a quiet certainty neither of them has had much room to sit in lately. “It's us. That’s all this needs to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studies her for a second longer, eyes soft, like she's memorizing the way Rio says ‘us.’ Then she nods, glancing towards the elevator. “Come on. We’ve got a bit of a drive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio arches a brow again. “Are you going to tell me where we’re going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's not ominous at all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha allows herself a small, teasing smile as she grabs her keys. “You trust me, don't you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs a small laugh. “I just watched you pack enough snacks to feed a family of four for the morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Agatha says. “I’m very prepared. And you didn't eat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gives her a look, somewhere between exasperation and amusement. “You realize you're kind of impossible, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, unbothered. “You say that like it's new information.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're lucky I’m letting you get away with this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m aware.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator chimes softly as the doors slide open. Agatha steps inside first, glancing back at her with a spark of mischief. “Come on, you'll like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio follows, shaking her head as she steps in. “You're still not going to tell me where we're going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope.” Agatha smiles, hands slipping into the pocket of her coat. “Trust the process.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gives her a dry look. “If this ends with me lost in the woods, I’m blaming you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d never stand you somewhere you couldn't hike out of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's not as comforting as you think it is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs a quiet laugh as the v elevators hum beneath them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The garage is quiet as the elevator door opens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of the black SUV that usually waits on standby, a smaller car sits parked near the front - sleek, understated, but clearly expensive in a way most of Agatha's belongings are. The kind of car that doesn't draw attention unless you know what you're looking for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances at it as they walk over. “New?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rarely used,” Agatha corrects. “This one's for when I don't need people to stare.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks as she moves towards the passenger seat. “You own all of these?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, unlocking the door with a chirp. “Technically, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her bread, pulling the door open. “That's only mildly concerning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slides into the driver's seat, voice light by steady. “You never know what you’ll need. Besides, it confuses the press.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorts as she settles into her seat. “I thought you handled them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did,” she says simply. “They know better than to circle near the penthouse. I have a strict no drive policy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks. “You threatened them didn't you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums, pulling the car smoothly out of the garage. “I offered… incentives in the form of creative language.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a soft laugh, seeking into her seat. “Right. totally above board.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glances over, smiling faintly. “No laws were broken.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just bent.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strategically."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head, but there's no real judgement behind it. If anything, she sounds almost impressed. “You're something else, you know that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So I've been told.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The city slowly falls behind them, tall buildings thinning into long stretches of open road. The shuttling shrinks until it's nothing but a suggestion into the rearview mirror.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exchales softly, eyes following the trees that start to line the highway. “Feels weird. Being out like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's voice dips, calm but warm. “Good weird, or bad weird?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still deciding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, her focus steady on the road ahead of her. “Well. You've got time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the drive settles into easy quiet. The kind they’ve gotten used to over the past few months - full of unspoken things neither of them feels the need to rush.</span>
</p><p>
<span>About forty-five minutes later, Agatha takes an exit off the highway, winding through narrow back roads flanked by tall trees. The houses out here are spaced wide apart, tucked behind long driveways and dense hedges, each one quieter than the last. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches the scenery shift, brow furrowing slightly as the car slows and turns up a gravel driveway. The house comes into view slowly - simple, private, built to disappear behind the trees rather than stand out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You own this too?” Rio asks, half amused, half curious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums as she shifts the car into park. “I bought it when I was pregnant with Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turns toward her, the question already sitting on her tongue. “Why here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was quiet,”  Agatha says simply. “Far enough away that the press didn’t care. Close enough to the city that I could still meet with Vision when we were first starting.” She pauses for a moment, voice dipping a little lower. “I wasn’t in a good place back then. This was… safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio studies her for a beat, reading the weight behind her words. “You don’t bring many people here, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles faintly, her gaze dropping for a second before meeting Rio’s again. “No. Not many.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment hands between them, full but steady. Agatha breaks it gently, nodding toward the tree-lined path leading away from the house.”The park entrance is just behind the property. Private access.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks. “Of course it is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opens her door, stepping out into the crisp air. “Perks of being prepared.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio follows, stretching carefully as her feet hit the ground. The early November breeze carries that familiar bite of late fall, but the open air feels good, better than she expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The trail winds gently beneath their feet, blanketed in a thin layer of fallen leaves that crunch softly with each careful step. Agatha keeps her pace steady, matching Rio’s without comment, though she glances over every so often, just to check without making it obvious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air is crisp but not bitter, the kind of cold that sharpens the edges of everything without cutting into the skin. As they walk, the trees thin out ahead of them, opening into a small clearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pond sits tucked between the trees, still glassy under the pale morning sun. A narrow dock juts out into the water, weathered but sturdy, worn smooth by seasons of wind and rain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slows as they reach the edge of the clearing, letting her eyes sweep over the scene. She exhales softly. “It’s nice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles, watching her. “Thought you might like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been here before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A few times.” Agatha glances out across the water. “Not recently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs a quiet laugh. “Let me guess. You own this too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Technically, it’s part of the property line,” Agatha admits with a small shrug. “I never really used it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head, but there’s no real bite to it. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They move toward a wide oak tree near the pond’s edge, its leaves mostly gone, branches reaching out like open hands. Agatha spreads a blanket across the dry ground, settling down first. She pats the space in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lowers herself down carefully, finding her balance before leaning back, not against the tree, but into Agatha’s chest. She exhales slowly, relaxing into the steady rhythm of Agatha’s breathing behind her. The blanket shifts as Agatha gently wraps it around them both, pulling Rio in a little closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The world is still. The soft lap of water against the dock. The occasional wind threading through the bare branches.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I missed this,” Rio murmurs after a while, voice quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The quiet?” Agatha asks softly, her chin resting lightly against the top of Rio’s head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The space.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, holding her a little closer, saying nothing for a moment. The silence is warm. Safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio shifts slightly, angling her head just enough to glance back at Agatha. A small smile tugs at her mouth. “So.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums. “So?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You gonna tell me more about the rest of your secrets?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arches a brow, amused. “Which ones?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile lingers. “Let’s start with the house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums softly, her voice warm against the cool air. “You know why I bought it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know the safe version,” Rio says. “Not the messy one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha goes still for a moment, eyes fixed somewhere past the pond. “I used to act, you know that already. I graduated early and landed the minor roles, but when WandaVision came out, the press were relentless. I was twenty-four or so. And I wasn’t ready for any of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t say anything, she just lets Agatha keep talking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was like someone flipped a switch overnight. Every interview, every headline, every red carpet - someone had something to say. I was already battling the nepotism claims but those were false.” She exhales quietly. “My mother wasn’t pulling strings for me. She wasn’t interested in helping at all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tenses slightly. “If anything, she resented it. I was supposed to be her project - the quiet daughter, the face of her brand. I was never meant to talk. Never meant to have opinions. Certainly never meant to be seen on my own terms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts slightly, leaning back into her but staying silent, letting Agatha choose how much to give.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So when the headlines started turning, when my personal life stopped being glossy, she didn’t defend me. She fed them. Handed the press everything they needed to gut me. The interviews. The rumors. The public slips.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thumb rubs absently over Rio’s hand. “That’s when I started using.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“At first it was just to keep up. Stay away, stay sharp. Then it was to take the edge off the press. Then to sleep. Then to breathe. And I couldn’t stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice dips lower. “By twenty-five, I was drowning. Lilia stepped in and told me to get my shit together and to not let my mother win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thumb keeps tracing slow circles over Rio’s hand beneath the blanket. “So I checked myself into rehab. And I stayed clean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leans into her a little more, grounding them both. “And Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice softens. “I found out I was pregnant not too long into rehab.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pauses, her breath steady but heavy. “Honestly? I thought about not keeping him. Everything was so-” her voice wavers, but she pushes through. “So broken. I was barely staying above water. My mother was already spinning her own versions of things in the press.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squeezes her hand gently, steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But Lilia wouldn’t let me give up. She reminded me I still had a choice, even when everything else felt like it was slipping. And for once, I made the right one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small, tired smile tugs at Agatha’s mouth. “He’s the reason I kept fighting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice is quiet, but certain. “You didn’t just survive it. You built something after it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales, her voice dipping softer. “I did. But sometimes, it still feels like I’m just waiting for it all to catch up to me. Like any day, the headlines will start again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turns her head slightly, meeting her gaze. “And if they do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles faintly. “Then I hope I’ve finally built enough to weather it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a beat before Rio speaks again, voice low but even. “Your mom sounds like a bitch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs a quiet laugh, almost surprised by it. “That’s… putting it lightly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips twitch into a faint smile. “I don’t really do delicate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezes her hand gently beneath the blanket. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I ever meet her, I’m sucker punching her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs out a breath of quiet laughter, shaking her head. “You’re about twenty years too late for that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances at her, brow raised. “She’s dead?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, her voice even but small. “Heart attack while I was in rehab. I think her last statement was something about the stress of having me as a daughter in rehab was too much for her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw tightens slightly, but her voice stays even. “Sounds like she died exactly how she lived.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a breath, almost a laugh but not quiet. “That was… about the size of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leans a little more into her side. “She doesn’t get to haunt you anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closes her eyes for a moment. “She does. Just quieter now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squeezes her hand, firm and steady beneath the blanket. “You’re still here. She’s not. That says enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales again, and this time, some of the weight seems to finally slip off her shoulders. “Yeah,” she murmurs. “It does.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sit in the quiet for a moment, letting the weight of Agatha’s words settle. The wind picks up slightly, rusting the bare branches overhead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio speaks, voice low. “You ever wonder if some people just aren’t mean to come back from things?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes shift down to her, reading the edge in her voice. “You mean you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio breathes out through her nose, eyes still gazed on the pond. “I was a loner long before the accident, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't press, she just listens. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, I know I didn't have anyone waiting for me when I woke up.” Her voice stays calm, but there's a quiet rawness to it. “I think I always kept people at arm's length. It was easier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's hands tighten gently around hers beneath the blanket. “You never really stayed invisible, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances at her, her brow slightly raised, like she wasn't expecting that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha breathes out softly, almost like she's thinking aloud. “Vision told me once, back at the hospital, that you've always been like this. Quiet, but not small. Apparently you used to walk into classrooms with dirt on your boots and branches still caught in your hair. And when people talked, you didn't flinch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a soft huff, almost like a breath of a laugh. “Yeah, that sounds about right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glances down at her, voice gentle. “He said it wasn't that you didn't need people. You just didn't trust that anyone would actually see you and stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s faint smile falters slightly. “I don't think that's far off from the truth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches her for a moment. “He also said the woods were your armor. You weren't trying to vanish, you were just protecting yourself. Like he used to with the auto shop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts slightly under the blanket, eyes flicking back toward the water. “I guess everyone just needs their safe place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's voice starts quiet, but warm. “They change overtime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows furrow faintly. “You think mine will?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezes her hand gently. “That’s not up to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales, her voice dropping. “That’s the part that scares me. If I don't have the park, then what do I have?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans in just slightly, her voice steady, but soft. “You have you, and time to decide.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio's eyes lower again, her voice quieter. “I don't know if I know how to start over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's thumb moves over her knuckles slowly. “You don't have to figure it all out right away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exchales another shaky breath. “I’m not used to having this much unknown, even with amnesia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles faintly. “That's why I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leans her head back against Agatha’s shoulder, letting the weight of it all settle. “I think I want to go back. To Westview, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't react with surprise, she just nods gently against her. “When you're ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitates for a brief moment, then quietly asks, “Will you come with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn't hesitate. “Of course I will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice stays soft. “Even if it’s messy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha presses her lips gently to Rio’s temple. “Especially if it’s messy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small breath escapes from Rio - not quite a laugh but lighter than before. She leans into Agatha’s warmth, letting the quiet finally settle between them, not so heavy now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Neither are sure how long they've been sitting out by the pond, but eventually Rio’s stomach grumbles and she mutters, “I think I’m hungrier than whatever snacks you packed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughs softly against her. “Good, I was starting to wonder how long you were going to survive off of trail mix and honey roasted peanuts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sits up a little, pulling the blanket tighter around her shoulders. “It served me well in another life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stands slowly, offering her hand. “Well, lucky for you, I have better options.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio takes her hand, letting Agatha pull her up. “You make it sound like I’ve been surviving in the wild.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arches a teasing brow. “You quite literally have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs, falling in step behind her. “I’m not sure that living in a penthouse qualifies as wilderness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks. “One week at the park, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorts. “I was on vacation. You’re the one who tried to bribe Lilia with granola bars.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughs softly. “I was attempting diplomacy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gives her a dry look. “You were trying to negotiate your way out of trail signage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums, completely unbothered. “I stand by my methods.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head, the smallest smile tugging at her mouth. “I never even knew you were there that week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glances over at her, voice softer now. “That's because you made yourself very hard to find.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs under her breath, but doesn't deny it. “Not hard enough, apparently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezes her hand lightly as they reach the car. “Lucky for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive is short. Just a few turns through the neighborhood before the streets open into the small town center with wide sidewalks and neatly trimmed trees lining the blocks; the kind of place to bully like everything important is within walking distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shows as they approach a modest diner tucked between a florist and a bookstore. Nothing flashy, just an old neon ‘Open’ sign humming through the window and a true of cars parked out front.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances out the window, half-smirking. “You really don't do flashy out here, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shuts off the engine with a small smile. “Sometimes simple is better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio unbuckles, giving a sidelong look. “That’s not the brand you advertise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arches a brow as she steps out of the car. “I contain multitudes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs as she falls into step beside her. “That's one way to put it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the diner hums with low conversation - nothing invasive, just the usual background noise of a place that’s existed long enough for people to stop being impressed by it. The waitress behind the counter gives Agatha a brief nod, like she's a familiar face, but leaves it at that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They’re both led to a booth in the back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slides in, her eyes drifting across the room for a beat before settling on Agatha. “You've brought people here before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans back slightly. “No, not like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets the words settle, voice dry but with a small pull of a smile. “Didn’t know I was making history.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles softly in return. “You are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio can deflect again, the waitress arrives, setting down two mugs of coffee without needing to ask. She offers a polite nod and quietly retreats, giving them space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances at the cup, then back at Agatha. “You’ve definitely been here before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifts her mug with a small shrug. “I raised Nicky here until he got sick.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances up at her, eyes softening a little. “You don’t talk about that part much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swirls her coffee gently, gaze dropping for a moment. “There’s not much to say that doesn’t sound heavier than it needs to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her for a beat, then says quietly. “He turned out okay."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs a quiet laugh. “Stubborn, argumentative, mouthy… yeah. He’s fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiles faintly behind her mug. “Wonder where he got that from.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shoots her a small look over the rim of her cup. “I’m deeply offended.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifts her hands slightly, playing innocent. “I’m just saying - genetics are weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shakes her head, but there’s warmth behind it. “You really don’t know when to quit, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiles, voice softer now. “Hasn’t failed me yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches her for a moment, eyes warm. “You always this cooperative on first dates?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs. “Can’t say I’ve tested the sample size.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile deepens, but she doesn’t tease it. She just nods once. “Well. You’re doing fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The waitress returns, setting down two plates of waffles, and vanishes just as quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio eyes her plate before glancing back at her. “They know your order?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifts her coffee cup with a small smile. “Old habits.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks faintly. “How many secret places like this do you have?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilts her head, pretending to think. “Enough. Not as many as people assume.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hums, cutting into her waffle. “Guess we’re both good at keeping people out when we want to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches her for a moment, voice softer now. “I was. For a long time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances up, meeting her gaze. “Not anymore?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gives a small shake of her head, smile faint but certain. “Not with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t say anything at first. She just holds eye contact a beat longer than usual before looking back down at her plate. The silence between them shifts - still quiet, but heavier in a different way now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few moments, Rio speaks again, her voice lower, careful. “Do you ever miss it? Acting? I imagine someone who studied it has a lot of creative passion and I suppose it’s a way to release it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles, like she wasn’t expecting the question but appreciates it anyway. “That’s one way to put it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pauses, thinking for a moment. “There was something freeing about it, yes. Pretending to be someone else meant I didn’t have to sit in my own mess for a while, even after I started using.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thumb brushes lightly against the rim of her coffee cup. “It let me feel like I was in control of something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her, processing that. Then, voice quiet but sure. “And now you build things instead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile shifts, softer. “Now I build things that matter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gives a small nod. “And you still get to stay behind the scenes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums in agreement. “Exactly where I prefer to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence lingers for a moment, the clinking of plates and low hum of conversation filling the background. Rio traces a slow line along the edge of her coffee cup, her gaze fixed on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, quieter, she says, “I think that’s what’s been hardest for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilts her head. “What is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s thumb pauses for half a second before she answers. “Not having anything to go back to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze softens. “What about the park?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales through her nose, gaze fixed on the table. “I’ve thought about it… I want to go back. I just don’t know what it’s going to feel like when I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze stays soft. “That’s okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers trace along the edge of her plate. “It’s not the place I’m nervous about. It’s me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gives her hand a gentle squeeze. “Whatever’s waiting, we’ll face it together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances up at her, meeting her eyes for a beat longer than usual. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet stretches again, but this time it’s easier with no pressure to fill it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They finish their breakfast without rushing - Agatha barely touches her second cup of coffee, Rio working through the waffles in steady bites. It’s not about the food anymore. Just the simple comfort of sitting across from each other, like they’ve done this a hundred times before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Rio sets her fork down, nudging her plate forward slightly. “I’m good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reaches for the check without a word. There’s no silent debate, no polite back-and-forth. Rio doesn’t move for a wallet she doesn’t even have on her. She just lets Agatha handle it, which somehow feels like a bigger surrender than anything either of themsays out loud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They step outside into the crisp air. The sun’s a little higher now, spilling lazy light across the quiet street.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha unlocks the car, and Rio moves toward the passenger side but lingers for a second before opening the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha catches the hesitation. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio adjusts her jacket, voice quieter. “Yeah. Just… not in a hurry to be stuck inside yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha then watches her for a beat, then tips her head toward the open road. “Then we won’t be,” but she doesn’t offer anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive doesn’t take long. Agatha weaves through the quiet backroaods like she’s done it before, well she has.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, she turns into a small lot, pulling up in front of a faded sign that reads ‘PUTT PARADISE - OPEN YEAR ROUND.’</span>
</p><p>
<span>The course is practically empty. Just a few scattered cars, a couple of kids chasing each other near the oversized fiberglass giraffe at hole two. It’s the kind of place that doesn’t expect anyone important to show up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha parks and cuts the engine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances out the window. “You’ve officially surprised me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles faintly, unbothered. “I’m only slightly offended it took mini golf for me to surprise you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs softly, unbuckling. “You’re full of surprises. This just wasn’t on the list.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rounds the car as Rio steps out. “Good. Keeps things interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the teenager behind the counter barely glances up as Agatha hands over a few bills. They’re handed two sleek black putters and a bin of bright neon balls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reaches in first, pulling out a green ball without hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches her for a beat, then selects a purple one with a faint smirk. “Very on brand for both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raises a brow. “You rehearsed that one, didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha feigns offense. “Please. My wit is entirely natural.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They step out onto the first hole, no scorecard, no real rules.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gestures toward the green. “Ladies first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lines up her shot, careful but casual, and sinks it with two clean strokes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums, impressed. “I should’ve known you’d be suspiciously good at this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Believe it or not, I haven’t touched a putter since I was in high school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks as she steps up to the mat. “And yet, here I am about to be thoroughly outplayed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches, deadpan. “There’s no way you were always beat by a child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha liens up her shot, barely glancing up. “Nicky was ruthless. Still is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She taps the ball. It skims past the edge of the obstacle, narrowly avoiding a full disaster, and settles just short of the hole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio arches a brow. “You gonna use Nicky as an excuse for everything?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles as she steps back, unrepentant. “When it fits.” She taps her ball in the next shot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lines up for the next hole, not even glancing at Agatha. “Convenient.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Practical,” Agatha corrects, watching her sink the putt cleanly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They continue moving through the course with soft banter, the kind of comfortable rhythm that’s become second nature to them. Rio’s shots stay consistent and steady even when her energy subtly shifts. The kind of tired that doesn't announce itself, but that Agatha’s learned to notice anyways.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By hole eight, Rio takes just a little longer to square her shoulders. The pauses between the swings stretch an extra breath or two. Nothing dramatic, just quiet fatigue creeping in around the edges.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha adjusts without comment, letting the pace slow naturally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she lands a lucky bank shot at hole nine, Agatha offers a small grin. “See? Dramatic arc.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs softly. “That or dumb luck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me have my narrative.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>By hole ten, the competition softens, but never fully disappears. The banter has thinned into easy, steady focus. Neither of them is playing for anything but the quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s shots are still sharp - she’s always been precise when she wants to be - but Agatha notices the slight extra beat between each swing. A fraction longer to set her feet. A little more care lowering into position. The kind of fatigue that only someone who knows her well would see.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha never mentions it. She adjusts her own pace, keeping things easy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At hole twelve, Rio sinks another clean shot. She leans on the putter for half a second longer before stepping aside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watches the small pause and keeps her tone light. “I should’ve made you carry both putters. Could’ve slowed you down a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs softly. “You’re already losing. No need to embarrass yourself further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks, lining up her shot. The ball clips the barrier, bounces wide, and rolls off to the edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stands up, entirely unbothered. “Still plenty of time for my comeback.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head faintly, that dry little almost-smile pulling at her mouth again. “I admire the optimism.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They fall back into rhythm. Agatha lets Rio lead, watching without hovering, knowing full well where Rio’s limits sit, but respecting the fact that Rio won’t ask for a break until she chooses to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By hole fifteen, Rio’s shifts between holes have grown quietere, more deliberate. She’s not struggling - but she’s burning energy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air stays comfortably cool for early afternoon - not hot, not cold, just bright and crisp enough that it makes the whole palace feel slightly surreal. The sun cuts sharp through the sky but not at an angle yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lands a clean shot on sixteen, glancing toward Rio with a small grin. “Dramatic arc.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales through her nose, amused but a little breathier now. “Keep telling yourself that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At hole seventeen, Rio lines up her shot, takes a slow breath, and sinks it with precision. Her balance wavers for a split second after, but she steadies herself quickly, like it’s instinct now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clocks it, but says nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, they reach hole eighteen. It’s one of those absurd contraptions with the oversized spinning barrel that swallows the ball when you time it right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio steps up first, narrowing her focus, watching the rotation carefully before tapping her ball through the gap cleanly. The ball disappears with a soft clunk into the machine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha steps up beside her. “Still not convinced you haven’t been secretly training.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks faintly, not rising to it. “I’m just talented."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha taps her ball through on the second spin, letting it drop into the barrel behind Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they turn to leave, Agatha’s hand settles lightly against Rio’s back - no pressure, just a small steady point of contact as they walk toward the car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back in the lot, Agatha opens up the passenger door first, standing there for a brief beat. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pauses before sitting, one hand braced lightly on the frame of the car. “Yeah. Just need to sit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she drops fully into the seat, she glances at Agatha, eyes holding hers for a little longer than usual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet stretches for just a moment, not uncomfortable, just there. Like Rio’s trying to stretch the moment for her memory</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Rio says softly. “For today. It was nice to just exist again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile is small, but steady. “Anytime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s another beat of quiet, and this time, Agatha leans in just a little, giving Rio every chance to pull back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss is soft, brief - nothing grand, just two people allowing themselves the space to exist a little closer than before. When they part, neither speaks right away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice stays gentle. “Now let’s get you home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs a quiet breath, the corner of her mouth tugging into the faintest smile. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She settles into the seat fully now, exhaling as she leans back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closes the door gently, circling around to the driver’s side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive home stays quiet, comfortably so. The early afternoon sun filters through the windshield, casting warm streaks of light across Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first stretch, Rio stays awake, eyes drifting out of the window, half-lidded. But as the road hums steady beneath them, her head eventually tips toward the glass, eyes slipping closed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha keeps her gaze forward, adjusting her speed almost unconsciously. She doesn’t need to look over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just drives, letting Rio rest.</span>
