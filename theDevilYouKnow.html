<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Rio bit back a yawn as she rose with the sun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One would think that after years of training, such early rousings would come more naturally. Rio had always been more inclined to dusk than dawn though, and it was with great reluctance that she left the warmth of her bedding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After splashing cold water on her face, Rio prepared for the day as she had the last fifteen years of her life. Leather pants, loose blouse, fitted bodice. Her belt to hold her tinctures and knives came next, along with the sheath for her dagger and the leather guards for her arms. Last came her crucifix, a gleaming silver piece that was the last remnant of the Vidal’s legacy. That, and Rio, of course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her lips to the cool metal before she slipped it over her head, letting the pendant rest right over her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she stepped out of her cottage, Rio combed her fingers through her hair, pulling the upper half into a bun to keep it out of her way. Around her, the rest of the village bustled about with morning chores.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slipped past those carrying laundry or gardening tools, heading straight for the large stone building at the center of their village. Several greeted her as she passed by, and Rio gave them each a respectful nod. Those who lived here had either known Rio since she was small or grown up with Rio as a staid fixture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small boy broke away from his group, running up to Rio with a wide, toothy grin. He greeted her with a wave, chirping, “Good morrow, Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Felix,” Rio replied, inclining her head. At ten years old, Felix was still rather short for his age, but he was no longer the frail boy Rio had found a year ago. She let her hand rest on his head briefly. “How is your training going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well enough,” Felix answered. He practically bounced in place as he explained, “I hope to practice with a real dagger soon.” He nodded to the one strapped to Rio’s thigh. “Like yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Phineas will give you a wooden one first,” Rio reminded him. Phineas was one of the best skilled hunters in their guild, but after a particularly brutal slaying that injured his leg, he kept to the village and trained their youths. Rio knew how it pained him at times, but she’d seen more than one student flourish under his tutelage. Hopefully, Felix would be another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Felix waved off her reminder, saying, “Yes, but </span>
<em>
<span>then</span>
</em>
<span> I can have a real one.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled fondly. “Yes, once you’ve proven you can be trusted, </span>
<em>
<span>then</span>
</em>
<span> you can have a real dagger.” She noticed the sun beginning to creep over the horizon. She ruffled Felix’s hair and said, “Study diligently and practice fiercely. I know you will do well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Felix beamed at her and said, “May fortune find you in favor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My thanks,” Rio replied, amused to hear the old hunters’ saying from such young, inexperienced lips. “Go along now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched as Felix scampered off before she continued to make her way to their guild’s base. It was a stone manor, just large enough to host guests and a select few, high-ranking hunters. Rio had been invited several times to move in, but each time, she gently rejected the offer. She preferred her own space in her cottage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>However, as much as she avoided actually living in the manor, Rio was never shy to help herself to the food there. This morning, Rio helped herself to a plate of soft-boiled eggs, sausage, and warm bread. She thanked the cooks for their work, and she walked with her food to the far end of the manor where the war room was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The war room was poorly named, but in truth, Rio was relieved that it had never lived up to its name. They were unlikely to survive if their hunt against vampires truly came to war. Still, everyone called it the war room, the cavernous room large enough to fit a long table and several crates of weapons and shelves of books. Some evenings, Rio enjoyed hiding in here and reading whatever happened to find its way into her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Already there was Theodore, who insisted everyone call him “Theo”. He was forty-five years old, one of the oldest of their hunters. He was broad-shouldered and scarred, with dark skin and black hair that he wore cropped short. Rio still remembered when some attempted to call him Lord Theodore, but that had been swiftly abandoned when Theo had punished such attempts with miles and miles of endurance training. Commander was the closest Theo came to formalities. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Took you long enough,” Theo grunted when he saw her. He only had a cup of tea in his hand. Maps took up most of the table in front of him. “I thought you would sleep until the sun was high.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The sun’s barely kissed the sky,” Rio replied, sitting down at the opposite end of the table. “Besides, is what we’re to discuss really of such urgency?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Depends on how you view the seven deaths of innocents.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth snapped shut. She ducked her head, chastened. “My apologies,” Rio said. “Please inform me of the circumstances of the deaths.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio ate, Theo explained to her the events in a far-out village, nearly a three days’ ride from here. Over the last two months, once a week, someone had gone missing. Only men. There was no doubt it was a vampire either. Every time the missing men were found, it was with two punctures at their throat and their bodies drained of blood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It unnerved Rio to hear that last detail. This vampire wasn’t even attempting to hide their true nature, flaunting it as if to goad hunters to come get them. Rio’s grip tightened around her fork. It was sickening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even after all these years, Rio still found vampires unfathomable. They defied the laws of nature, in Rio’s eyes. They were never meant to live again, let alone with the life blood of others to sustain themselves. They were abominations. How else could one explain the careless way they wielded life and death? </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was only once Rio had ever seen a vampire partake in mercy. She was living proof of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It only made Rio loathe them more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When do I leave?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tomorrow,” Theo answered. He walked around the table and handed her a map with the directions to the village. “Spend today preparing all of your necessities.” When Rio went to take the map, Theo withdrew slightly. He waited until she met his eyes to say, “I know this is ill timing for you. Do you wish to have someone accompany you for this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Flashes of fire and screams flared behind Rio’s eyes. She blinked hard. Rio shook her head and said, “I require no assistance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fortune does not shine on those too stubborn to admit when they need help,” Theo said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clenched her jaw and snatched the map from his hands. She stood abruptly from her chair and snapped, “Lady Fortune is a fickle mistress. She will pick and choose as she pleases. Having someone shadow me on such a task will have no bearing on the outcome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat of silence before Theo asked, “Are you done acting like a child?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you done treating me like one?” Rio shot back. For a moment, she swore she could feel the licks of flames against her skin. She swallowed. “Am I dismissed, Commander?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Theo stared at her, dark eyes piercing. Rio held her ground though. Such a gaze lost its effect when one faced it since one was twelve. Eventually, Theo sighed and said, “Dismissed. I expect to see you before you leave tomorrow. Dawn.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, sir,” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was much to prepare for an indefinite hunt like this. Rio could be gone for one day, or she could be gone for one month. Because of this, Rio knew it was best to prepare for a lengthier stay. She stopped by the blacksmith to sharpen her weapons, the stables to ready her horse, the apothecary to gather the necessary potions and herbs, the storehouse for food, and finally, the wash house for one last bath. There was no telling the amenities a village that far from others would have. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Thanks to her station as a hunter, Rio walked past the larger bathing area for the majority of villagers. She stepped up to a door and smoothed her thumb over the rune carved right above the door knob. The rune glowed gold briefly, followed by a click. Rio stepped inside the smaller bathroom and went about heating the water. It was nearly midday now, and there were few bathing at this time. Not to mention, this was solely for hunters who were women, and there were even less of them to run into here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sinking into the steaming water, Rio knew it would be wise to begin to craft her strategy. Despite this, Rio found her thoughts drifting. As much as she didn’t want to admit it, Theo was right. Sending Rio off on a hunt during this time was risky. Each year when the day of her family’s deaths came, Rio grew tetchy. It wasn’t just that she was rude to others. Her thinking grew clouded. Her actions grew impulsive. Rio would have to monitor herself carefully as she went to this village. Losing herself in her memories could prove fatal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Rio finished her bath and dressed, she finished the last of her preparations. It would be wise to go home and retire for the evening. If she did, she would be well rested for the long travel ahead. Instead, Rio made her way out to the nearby field. Rows and rows of crops greeted her, but all of its caretakers had already gone home for the night. That was fine by Rio, who picked her way between the plants and settled herself among the budding fruits. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was something Rio had done since the hunters’ guild took her in. The grief and guilt that clung to her did not feel nearly as suffocating out here. Perhaps that was why Rio came out here tonight. Laying against the cool dirt, Rio pulled her crucifix from beneath her shirt and held it above her face, letting the moonlight cast a glow against the metal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio still remembered when she first received this. At six years of age, Rio had seen the shining jewelry adorning her grandmother's neck. She clambered into her lap and asked what it was, tiny fingers running along its edges.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is protection,” her grandmother had told her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“From what?” Rio had asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grandmother had stared at her with weary eyes and said, “Devils.” When Rio startled, her grandmother had taken off the necklace and put it around Rio’s neck. “There,” she’d said. “You will be safe now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will be safe so long as I have you, my dear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grandmother hadn’t been safe though. No one had. To this day, Rio wondered if it’d truly been this crucifix that saved her life that night. She wasn’t sure if she could handle it if it was, knowing that her grandmother’s kindness had also been her death. She also wasn’t sure if she could handle it if it wasn’t, knowing that her life was some kind of cruel coincidence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her lips to the crucifix and went home.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . .</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not even the sun was awake when Rio left the following morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thanks to a sleepless night, Rio was able to leave even sooner than planned, but as requested, she still stopped by the manor before she left. She strode into the building dressed as she had the day before, but to fend off the chill of the autumn morning, Rio slipped on her cowl and cloak as well, securing the chain of her cloak across her chest and pulling its collar up around her neck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dramatic,” Theo had always said in amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This morning though, there was no humor in Theo’ demeanor. He peered at her in the dim glow of candlelight, scanning her person to ensure she was appropriately armed. He nodded after a moment and gestured for her to follow him outside to where Rio’s black horse, Dahlia, was waiting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be careful,” Theo said. “Take no unnecessary risks.” He stood tall with his hands behind his back, but Rio knew him too well. There was a worry that made his brows furrow ever so slightly. Rio wished to assure him, but she knew nothing would soothe him except her safe return.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, Commander,” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Theo sighed and placed a warm hand on Rio’s shoulder. Even though things were tense between them, Theo still told Rio, “May fortune find you in favor.” It was considered bad luck not to exchange the words before a hunt, as if condemning the hunter to a luckless death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My thanks,” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope this will prove a simple matter,” Theo said, squeezing her shoulder once. “Nonetheless, don’t be rash.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who, me?” Rio said with a small grin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Theo rolled his eyes, and it was with a final pat on Rio’s shoulder that he sent her off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even as the sun began to rise, Rio’s route was quiet. That was unsurprising though. Many would be traveling in the opposite direction as her, heading towards the clustered villages that came before the city, rather than further out into the wild. As she rode, Rio kept an eye out for anything suspicious, but nothing struck her as strange, even as she grew closer and closer to her destination. </span>
</p><p>
<span>However, just a mile out from the village, Rio came to an abrupt stop, feeling the back of her neck prickle. She waited a moment, but the sensation remained. She climbed down from her horse and pulled her cowl over her mouth and nose. With slow, deliberate moves, Rio unsheathed her dagger and prowled forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes scanned the area, but all she saw were trees. Turning slowly, she sought out any sign of others, but all she saw was a figure on the ground a little ways away. Rio adjusted her grip on her dagger as she crept forward, careful not to step on any stray branches. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It could be a trap. Someone pretending to be unconscious, or perhaps, it was a decoy with someone waiting elsewhere to ambush her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kept all of her wits about her, but when she drew close, she saw it was nothing but a dead deer. Rio inspected the pitiful creature with its throat torn out. She muttered a prayer to Lady Fortune, wishing for a swift return to the earth for the deer and a better fate for herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Glancing around, Rio determined no one would be surprising her here. She knelt beside the deer and examined its throat. It was difficult to know whether it was a wolf or a vampire; both were brutal in their bites, and this particular wound was so messy that Rio couldn’t gauge the size of the mouth or teeth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head as she stood again. She had an awful feeling about this. She needed to make sure she was prepared. She looked around the woods again and decided there was no better time or place than here or now. Rio shed her cloak and rolled up her sleeves. With the practiced ease of years of experience, Rio pressed the tip of her dagger into her skin, whispering under her breath as she did. Rather than draw blood, a reddish glow trailed after the dagger as Rio carved runes along her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a well-kept secret of hunters, these runes. People knew of runes to set traps or start fires, but few knew of the ancient runes meant to give hunters heightened strength and speed to fight against the unnatural. No one could say where the runes came from, only that they were a rare advantage that only hunters knew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only learned of it herself when she turned eighteen, the acceptable age to begin using them. It took diligence and skill to correctly draw and activate runes, but they had never been a problem for Rio, who accepted the way they burned her flesh without so much of a blink. That had always concerned Theo, but it was undeniably Rio’s greatest strength as a hunter, her tolerance for more runes than any other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, Rio only carved three runes into her skin: strength, speed, and perception. She would add more after she determined the true danger of what she was dealing with. Rio put her cloak back on and made sure her sleeves covered the runes. They made others skittish.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mounting her horse once more, Rio traveled the last stretch before she reached the village. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Given the violent reports they received, Rio expected a rather sedate, hushed atmosphere, but the village bustled with the usual energy of any other village. It was strange to think of them as unaffected by the string of murders. Seven men dead could easily be a third of the men in a village. Yet, no one seemed especially worried or scared. They continued on, as if the deaths were just another part of life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The villagers’ strange behavior made Rio itch with the urge to immediately go and investigate, but courtesy and manners dictated she see the head of the village before she did anything. With great reluctance, Rio made the trek to the large house on the hill that casted a shadow on the rest of the village. Eyes tracked her as she went, followed by whispers. Rio did not need to strain her hearing to know what they were saying. </span>
<em>
<span>Nightwalker</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio loathed the name her people had gained over the years by the common masses. It was too much like something one would call the vampires. However, the name grew in its popularity, as did people’s distaste for hunters. Due to their progression, they kept to themselves and traveled most often when the moon was alight and high in the sky. That, coupled with their ability to match a vampire’s prowess, left an unsavory taste in many mouths.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite being necessary, hunters were treated only a fraction better than the monsters they killed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio finally arrived at the village head’s house, a meek servant greeted her and took her cloak before she led her into the sitting room. A small fire burned, making the room just warm enough to make Rio shift uncomfortably. Sitting on one of the couches was the village head, a fat man with a carefully trimmed, brown beard and a ruddy complexion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lord Edmure Harkness was not of any bloodline Rio knew of, but Rio did not take any kind of particular care to memorizing the households of nobility. Her time was better spent sharpening a blade or even cleaning out a horse stall. This was why Rio was less than impressed when Edmure stood and exclaimed, “The Nightwalker has arrived!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My lord,” Rio said flatly. She fell into the expected bow, but she did not linger in it. The greeting was warmer than she expected though. Many were not so welcoming to have a hunter in their midst. Some believed them to be an ill omen, even if they are the ones to request their presence. The paradoxical nature of the mythos that surrounded hunters made Rio roll her eyes often. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sit, sit,” Edmure said, waving at the couch across from him. “Have you eaten yet?” Before Rio could even answer, Edmured continued, “Let us eat. I know the journey must have been long, and my cook has just brought out freshly made biscuits.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit back her annoyance and said, “Thank you, my lord, for your generosity, but I would prefer to begin my investigation while there is still an abundance of daylight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, Edmure took no offense. He chuckled, saying, “I suppose the stipulations that Nightwalkers only live and breathe to continue on to their next kill are true.” Rio’s eyes narrowed as Edmure said, “If you insist on traipsing through the woods, I must insist my daughter accompany you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your daughter?” Rio repeated, caught between confusion and exasperation. What was this vapid noble going on about now?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Edmure nodded. “Yes, I think she would be of great assistance to your cause.” He glanced over his shoulder and waved his hand once more. “Rio, this is my daughter, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slight woman stepped forward, dressed far too elaborately for a humble village miles out from the nearest trading post. Agatha appeared to be the only daughter of the minor lord though, so perhaps, in their insipid brains, they saw it fit to deck her out in the finest silks they could afford to maintain some kind of misguided superiority over their villagers. It wouldn’t surprise Rio if it worked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had the kind of classical beauty that nobility passed on from generation to generation, with high cheekbones and a sharp nose. Dark hair was swept into an updo, but long strands hung around her face, framing it. Her skin was pale, as was fitting for a woman of her station, and her eyes were a startling blue, the kind that looked unnatural. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her clothing only served to accentuate her beauty. Agatha’s dress consisted of a black bodice and skirt and a matching blouse, lined with a blood red fabric that dipped low, toying with propriety. The most eye-catching part of her finery was her necklaces, black jewels that swooped along collarbones and clustered around an oval, purple stone. For a moment, Rio thought there was something engraved, but when she blinked, all she saw was smooth violet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Giving a short bow, Rio said, “How do you do, Lady Harkness?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for coming so quickly,” Agatha said. Her voice was lower than Rio expected. It wasn’t the usual simpering but rather it was low, almost rough. An odd dichotomy against her dress. “I hope to aid in your hunt however I can.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As generous as your help is, it is best that I work alone,” Rio said. There was an underhandedness to the kindness. They did not truly trust her. Why else have someone so ill-suited to the task to follow her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would it not be beneficial to have someone who knows the woods at your side?” Edmure countered. “Someone to help guide you through our village and provide insight into the families of the victims.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps if it were a competent hunter, who was not an obvious play to keep an eye on her. Rio made sure to keep her voice even as she said, “My lord–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha will attend to your needs,” Edmure said firmly, and Rio wasn’t sure if she was imagining the amused curl to said woman’s lips as he said this. “She will provide the necessary particulars and inform me of all that you discover.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it not,” Rio struggled to sound like she was not passing judgement on his propriety, “unconventional for the lord’s daughter to partake in such activities?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We are not so small-minded simply because we live far from the city,” Edmure admonished. “I would have thought a Nightwalker such as yourself would understand the need for a young lady to take advantage of the opportunities afforded to her, no matter how unsightly to others it may seem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought of any kind of parallel drawn between her and a lord’s daughter was laughable, but Rio inclined her head and said, “My sincerest apologies, my lord. I would be honored to have your daughter accompany me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Edmure beamed at her and said, “I knew you would understand. Please allow Agatha to break her fast before she joins you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Rio agreed. “I will be in the village in the meantime, speaking to your people, if you will allow it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once the permission was granted, Rio excused herself. As she stepped back out into the brisk morning air, she heaved a heavy sigh. She gave a resentful glare over her shoulder, wishing that someone else was given this assignment after all. Looking after some nobleman’s daughter felt akin to punishment, and if she didn’t know any better, she would guess Theo planned this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a resigned air, Rio set off to explore the village and its strange inhabitants. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the two hours it took for the Harknesses to complete their meal, Rio wandered the village, speaking to a few villagers who were out to gather their thoughts on the recent murders. Many did not have much to say, merely expressing their worries and fears to her. That was mostly the women though. The men refused to acknowledge her presence, as if her being here was some statement against the capabilities. It was a vain practice of pride, as if any of them here would be able to hold their own against anything in the realm of a vampire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was almost a relief when Agatha appeared alongside a servant, saving Rio from one of the blacksmith apprentices, who’d taken it upon himself to lecture her about the finer details of caring for silver weaponry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her eyes widen as she took in the sight of Agatha, newly prepared for her endeavor with Rio. It appeared that the length of time was not simply due to eating but also changing her apparel. Gone was the luxurious gown, and in its place were riding leathers, a blouse, and a fitted bodice with laces up the front and embroidered with gold. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No need to look so surprised, Nightwalker,” Agatha called out to her. “I am not so foolish as to travel the woods in silk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One never knows with ilk of your kind,” Rio muttered under her breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forced herself to take another breath as she watched Agatha dismiss her servant. This was of no issue. Rio had taken Felix on a hunt before, and that had been tolerable. Of course, that had been a hunt for deer, and Felix was far more obedient than a spoiled noble. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flashed her a smile that was far too excitable for someone who was about to venture into the same woods where seven bodies were found. “Shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“After you, my lady,” Rio said. “You are my guide after all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No need to sound petulant, Nightwalker,” Agatha replied, but she still walked ahead, straight into the woods without any sort of hesitation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed her, thankful her back was to her, so Rio could express the true extent to her exasperation, poking her tongue out. Once the childish urge passed, Rio cleared her throat and asked, “What can you tell me of the victims? The reports your father sent only told us that they were all men.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you give me a knife?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked owlishly at the sudden question, unsure where it had even come from. Agatha had not even deigned to turn to face her to ask. Warily, Rio said, “I do not think that would be wise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How am I to protect myself then?” Agatha looked at her now, nose wrinkled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stated what should have been a given, “I will protect you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you promise?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up sharply at Agatha then, meeting her piercing gaze. The other woman raised a brow, taunting Rio in her lack of an answer. Rio exhaled slowly through her nose as she chose her words carefully. This woman was more difficult than she initially seemed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As is my duty as a hunter of my guild, I swear to protect your life with my own,” Rio said. The familiar words allowed her to relax a fraction. It reminded of being twelve years old and reciting such words for the first time, inducting her into the guild. A simpler time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Duty,” Agatha repeated the word slowly, as if tasting it for the first time. She turned to face Rio fully, walking backwards with ease despite the uneven ground.  “Is that all your life revolves around? Duty?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that so wrong?” Rio replied with a tilt of her head. “To dedicate myself to the protection of others?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what of yourself?” Agatha asked. She stopped, allowing Rio to draw closer. It was only when Rio stopped herself, a few feet away, that Agatha said, “Do you not have anything else you desire?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat bobbed at the way Agatha’s voice deepened on the last word. She licked her lips before she said, “This is not an appropriate topic of discussion.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this not what women discuss?” Agatha said with exaggerated innocence, eyes wide. When Rio merely shook her head and continued walking, Agatha sighed and fell into step with her. “Fine,” Agatha said. “Then tell me, Nightwalker, how does one kill a vampire?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do not believe that is an appropriate topic of discussion either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At this, Agatha rolled her eyes. “Come now,” she said. ” “My father sent me here with you, did he not?” Rio did not answer. Agatha stared at her for a moment longer before she said, “Fine, I shall start. A wooden stake to the heart is a time-honored method.” Unable to help herself, Rio eyed Agatha, to which Agatha smirked and said, “Do not look at me like that, hunter. I do read.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pardon me, but last I was informed, occult is not typically on the list for well-to-do women to read,” Rio replied. Her tone was dry and unamused, but for some reason, it only made Agatha’s smile grow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was I wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no escaping this line of conversation, it appeared. Rio said, “No, it is a fair choice of weapon. It is also the most accessible to those untrained and unequipped for such dangers. One can fashion a wooden stake with ease.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And for those who are trained?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Silver.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes dipped low before they flicked back up to Rio’s face. “Like your dagger?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the urge to use her cloak to cover the weapon. Her hands remained at her side. “Yes, like my dagger,” Rio said. “Now, my lady, tell me of the victims.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, Agatha relented and spoke all of what she knew of the seven men who were murdered. Four of the men were fathers, and three of the men were unwed. Their ages ranged from twenty to sixty years, and while none of the men were saints, only two of them were worthy of any scorn. All of the men were found in the very woods they were walking through, drained of blood but with little other injury.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And this has never happened before?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not that I know of,” Agatha answered. Despite Rio’s quick pace, she did not seem fatigued in the least. It made Rio ponder exactly what the other woman did during her leisure time because it certainly wasn’t sitting around. Any other noble would have been red-faced and panting by this point. “My father had our advisor look into the archives, but there was nothing of note there either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed, considering all that she knew. It wasn’t unheard of for vampires to go into hibernations of sorts, coming out to kill only every so often, but that was rare. For the most part, vampires preferred regular feeding, so it was likely that a vampire recently came into the area. They most likely assumed the feedings would go unnoticed or unhelped considering how distant the village was from others. The real question was whether the vampire was still here or they moved on already.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was deliberating the merit in setting a trap when Agatha suddenly pitched forward. Her petty glee at the other woman finally tripping was cut short by her reflexes. Rio stepped into her path, catching Agatha around her waist before she could hit the ground. She held her breath as Agatha stumbled into her. Agatha’s hands found purchase against her chest, and Rio could not remember the last time she felt another body so solidly against her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How gallant,” Agatha said breathlessly. She made no move to free herself from Rio’s arms, peering up at Rio through thick lashes. Her eyes were bright and blue even in the overcast of a dull morning, and Rio was reminded of just how beautiful she was. “Perhaps I could be persuaded to find a new appreciation for Nightwalkers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flushed. She opened her mouth to deflect when she suddenly tensed. Her ears caught the crackle of leaves just behind them. Releasing Agatha, Rio spun on pure instinct and launched a knife in the direction of the sound. The blade sank into the rabbit, killing it instantly.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Adrenaline made Rio’s ears ring as she scanned the area for anything else. After a moment, her body relaxed. Just the rabbit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see why you were sent.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stiffened once more, glancing over her shoulder to where Agatha eyed her with something much darker than the previous, playful admiration. “You are much more competent than I expected,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You flatter me,” Rio said, dismayed to find she was the one who sounded a tad breathless now. She rubbed her hands on her pants and turned away. “Let us continue.” She did not wait to see if Agatha would follow, but she heard the crunch of leaves a moment later. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head minutely. Of all the things to distract her on this assignment, a nobleman’s daughter had not even been a consideration.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . .</span>
</p><p>
<span>For once, Rio had never been so glad to see the setting sun. It was a sign to head back to the village, a place where she would no longer be alone with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio remained on edge for the entire day, unable to free her mind of the feeling of Agatha’s body against her own. It was a foolish thing to linger on, but Rio could not bring her mind to cooperate. Several times, she would drift, recalling supple curves and coy smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was not uncommon for Rio to find women attractive during her travels, but never before had someone elicited such a reaction from her before. It was maddening, especially considering who it was that had captured her attention so. Rio found Agatha infuriatingly flippant and uncomfortably curious, but she also knew that those same traits were also what drew her to Agatha, along with a sharp tongue and a sharper mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More than a little wound up, Rio was ready to report her meager findings to Edmure and excuse herself for the night. However, such plans were quickly derailed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood in the same sitting room she had that very morning. Her cloak had been taken once more, and Rio felt oddly vulnerable despite the dagger on her thigh and knives along her belt. She was blessedly alone though, and for that, Rio was thankful. Agatha had disappeared to her rooms as soon as they returned, leaving Rio to inform her father of what they found.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There wasn’t much beyond basic speculation, and Rio informed Edmure of that when he arrived. Each of the places where the bodies were found did not seem to be accidental, soIf Rio had to assume, she would think that the bodies were forming a shape. It was no shape that Rio could identify so far though. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is a ritual of some kind,” Rio explained. “I would need to consult my books for the specific, but that is what it appears to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A ritual to do what?” Edmure asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned, “I am unsure at this time, but I would like to search the village at night. That was when all of the killings took place, so there may be something I’m missing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not tonight,” Edmure said immediately. Rio’s consternation must have been clear because Edmure all but scolded her, “Staying out all night when you are weary after a day of travel? Do you wish to greet Death so soon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My lord, please,” Rio said. “I am fully capable of defending myself. Is that not why you requested my presence in the first place?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Edmure was adamant though, shaking his head and saying, “I will not have another death on my hands, and certainly not yours.” It was a blatant, manipulative play, but it was one that put Rio in an uncomfortable position nonetheless. If she were to refuse, Rio would look callous and irreverent to the toll losing so many people had on the village head. “One night of proper rest is all I ask of you.” Despite his phrasing, his tone brokered no argument. His decision was final. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gritted her teeth before she bit out, “Thank you for the generous hospitality, my lord.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As infuriating as it was to be trapped in the lord’s manor, Rio could not deny that the food served during supper was some of the best that she had. Tender rabbit in a decadent wine sauce, silky mashed potatoes bathed in butter, roasted root vegetables with just enough char to make them smoky. It was the best meal Rio had in ages, and it was nearly enough to distract Rio from the fact that Agatha sat across from her in a flattering gown the color of twilight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a relief for Rio to retire to her chambers, perusing the books of lore old and new she had packed, until a servant came to inform her that the bath was ready for her. She followed the same quiet servant from before down the various halls until they came upon the bathroom. It held the same luxurious quality as the rest of the house did, warm wood and intricately painted tiles lining the walls and floors. A large clawfoot bathtub sat in the center of the room, already full of steaming water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dismissed the servant and began to undress, beginning with the buckles of her arm guards. She let them fall to the floor, quickly followed by her belt and bodice. As she began to undo her shirt, there was a knock. “Come in,” Rio said, not bothering to turn. She assumed it was the servant with soaps or extra towels, but when the door did not open again for her to leave, only then did Rio turn. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood there, hands behind her, back pressed against the door. Her eyes were sharp and hungry as she stared at her. Her hair fell in long waves down her back. All she wore now was a thin shift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands froze over her buttons, blouse half open. “Lady Harkness,” Rio said. “What are you–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would be remiss not to offer my services to help you prepare to bathe,” Agatha said. She pushed off the door and approached Rio with slow, deliberate steps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed as Agatha came to a stop just a foot away from her. Her own hands still clutched at her blouse. Rio licked her lips and asked, “Is that not a job for a servant?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was not fazed though, replying swiftly, “I merely wish to express my gratitude to the great Nightwalker who has come to our aid.” She smiled sweetly, but it reminded Rio more of a predator lying in wait than any sort of guileless prey. “Will you grant me the opportunity to do so?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you wish,” Rio said after a pause. She lowered her hands and held her breath as Agatha stepped forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of their eyes strayed, even as Agatha stripped her of her clothing, piece by piece. Her hands did not fumble or hesitate; they moved with quick precision, and it was only when she tugged on the lacing for her pants that Rio reacted, mouth falling open ever so slightly as her hips canted forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The corner of Agatha’s lips ticked upwards, but neither of them reacted beyond that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the last of her clothing fell to the floor, there was a moment where time felt suspended with only the two of them in existence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Growing up with the guild, Rio held no shame for her body. It was merely a weapon, just like everyone else’s. This was why Rio did not flinch under Agatha’s stare. However, as it grew heavy with lust, Rio’s body tingled, not with shame but with the distinct sensation of being perceived in such a manner. Of being desired. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio considered asking her to leave when Agatha reached out and ran her fingertips along the runes burned into her arms. They were smooth and silvered like scars. “What are these?” Agatha asked. It was the first time she’d looked away from her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Protection,” Rio answered simply. “An old hunters’ tradition.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do they hurt?” Agatha’s fingers closed around Rio’s arm. Her thumb stroked the skin, sending a shiver down Rio’s spine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her hand stay for another moment before she finally pulled away. Her hand clenched into a fists briefly before it relaxed once more. Her eyes lingered, first on the runes then on the crucifix that still hung around Rio’s neck. Agatha’s voice was deceptively casual as she asked, “Is there anything else I can assist you with?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have done plenty,” Rio replied softly. “You have my thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inclined her head. She met her eyes once more, and for a moment, Rio thought she meant to say something, but she merely bit her lip and left. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt a bit like watching an apparition fade away with Rio left blinking, wondering if she’d imagined the entire thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once a minute passed and Agatha did not reappear, Rio shook her head and proceeded with her bath. As she washed herself, she tried to plan what she would do tomorrow, but it was all too easy to become lost in thought, remembering Agatha standing so close. She had removed her clothes so easily with sure hands that Rio wished to feel against her skin once more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How long had it been since Rio took a lover? A year, at least. A maid at one of the inns she stopped at during one of her trips. She’d been a lovely thing, round cheeks and flexible, moaning softly in Rio’s ear. How would Agatha sound in the throes of passion? Rio imagined her throaty and desperate and begging.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand had drifted between her legs when the door suddenly opened. There’d been no knock this time, and Rio’s hand jumped to grip the edge of the tub. </span>
</p><p>
<span>However, it was no surprise as to who slipped into the room. Agatha shut the door firmly behind her before she strode towards Rio with a kind of determination that made the hairs on the back of Rio’s neck stand tall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Harkess, is there something you need?” Rio asked, forcing her voice to remain light. It still shook though. Rio’s fantasies were still at the forefront of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I admit there is something,” Agatha said in a low voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held still as Agatha came to her side once more. She knew she was playing a dangerous game with this woman, but she could not ignore the way her pulse quickened at the mere sight of her, the way her blood seemed to sing for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knelt beside the tub. The two of them stared at each other, allowing for the chance to retreat, but when neither of them made any futile attempt at stopping this, Agatha reached out and brushed a wet strand of hair from Rio’s face. It was a tender action made worse by the way her fingers lingered against the damp skin of her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh,” Agatha whispered. She flattened her palm against Rio’s jaw, cradling as if she were something precious. Her eyes jumped across her face as they seemed to take in every inch. It reminded Rio of the way a wife gazed at her husband before he left for a hunt, trying to memorize all of him that she could. Any protest died on Rio’s lips. “Do you feel it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite herself, Rio said, “Feel what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath ghosted against her lips as she leaned in. Their noses brushed. They were so close now that the front of Agatha’s shift was pressed against the side of the tub. The wet fabric turned sheer, and Rio only caught a glimpse before she forced her eyes upwards once more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite the cooling water, Rio felt as though her body had been plunged into ravenous flames. Her cheeks burned, and her lungs would not work. She was trapped in an all-consuming heat that could only be simultaneously soothed and worsened by Agatha’s blistering touch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You feel it, don't you?” Agatha continued. She spoke in a crooning lilt, hypnotic in its melody. Her hand slid into Rio’s hair, holding her head at its base. “Just as you did in the woods.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is an attraction between us,” Rio conceded. “But attraction is merely–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Temptation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The single word struck Rio like lightning, a flash of something so sharp that it cut through the heat and straight to Rio’s core. Agatha could tell as well. Her hand tightened around Rio’s hair, pulling it ever so slightly. Rio bit down hard on her lip in response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you ever been tempted, Nightwalker?” Agatha purred. When Rio could only stare, Agatha smirked and whispered, “I think you have. I think you enjoy it.” She turned her head and let her lips brush against Rio’s cheek. “The anticipation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And have you?” Rio asked, finally finding her voice, hoarse and quiet as it was. “Been tempted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Plenty,” Agatha said. She pulled back just enough to smile devilishly in Rio’s face. “And I find it ever so pleasurable to give in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew she would regret it, but the fire in her veins commanded her to say, “Prove it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did not crash her lips against hers as she expected. In fact, she did not kiss her at all. Not at first. Instead, she rose to her feet. With a hand on the edge of the bathtub to balance herself, Agatha eased herself into Rio’s lap, straddling her thigh. The addition of her in the bathtub sent the water flowing over the edge, but neither of them paid that any mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The water soaked Agatha’s shift immediately, and Rio licked her lips as she realized just how sheer it became. The dress clung to every inch of Agatha’s body, accentuating not only her curves but also the patch of dark hair between her thighs and the hardened nipples on her chest. Rio finally reached out and pressed her hands to Agatha’s legs, just above her knees. Agatha let out a small noise, and Rio’s eyes flicked up to find Agatha already watching her. Her eyes were dark with desire, cheeks flushed and lips parted. Agatha’s arms had found their way to Rio’s neck, and Rio could feel the gentle scrape of her long nails against her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved her hands leisurely up the back of Agatha's thighs, watching as Agatha’s breath quickened the higher they got. When she reached Agatha’s ass, she dug her fingers in for just a moment before she yanked Agatha firmly into her lap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped, resting her forehead against Rio’s. Her eyes fluttered shut before Agatha stubbornly opened once more, keeping Rio in her gaze. “Kiss me,” Agatha breathed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Call me by my given name first,” Rio said. She saw Agatha’s eyes widen, but she just held her closer and whispered, “I want to hear you call my name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio told her, and Agatha smiled, small but wondrous in a way that made Rio’s heart give a traitorous skip. “Kiss me, Rio,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hearing her name on Agatha’s lips, there was nothing Rio could do but obey. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their lips met in a heated kiss, and Rio moaned softly at the feeling of Agatha leaning fully against her. The friction of Agatha’s wet shift against her sensitive skin made Rio’s entire body shudder. It still wasn’t enough though. Her hands moved eagerly along everywhere they could reach, but Rio favored the curve of Agatha’s ass that made Agatha bite her lip hard or the back of her neck where Agatha let her control the kiss. She felt drunk as Agatha slid her tongue against hers, but more than that, Rio felt as if she’d suddenly become aware of just how starving she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Breaking away from their kiss, Rio pressed messy, open-mouthed kisses along Agatha’s jaw and neck. She did not even bother taking off the dress once she reached the neckline. She nuzzled her chest before she took her nipple into her mouth and sucked on it hard through the wet fabric. Agatha moaned, bucking against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need more,” Agatha said. She sat back, fumbling with the buttons of her shift. She only did enough for it to slip further down her shoulders, baring her chest to Rio. She cupped Rio’s head and guided it back to her breasts. When Rio’s tongue flickered against the bare nipple, Agatha moaned and pressed her face closer. Rio sucked once more, relishing in the whine it elicited. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio switched to her other breast, she eased her hand between Agatha’s legs, fitting two fingers into her with ease. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Agatha breathed. Clumsily, the first time Rio had seen her be anything but poised, Agatha pressed her fingers inside Rio as well. When Rio gasped at the sensation, Agatha was quick to swallow the sound, licking her way back inside Rio’s mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel her pleasure growing, and when Agatha crooked her fingers just so, Rio groaned, “I’m close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s whine was cut off by Agatha letting out a long, throaty moan. Just as desperate as Rio imagined. It only made her that much closer to coming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Say it again,” Agatha said. She had one hand gripping the back of Rio’s neck as she moved her other steadily between Rio’s legs. She was close enough that their lips brushed as she spoke. “My name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio trembled with need. She slid her hand from Agatha’s ass to her back, pressing her even closer. Their breaths came in quick pants against each other's lips, and Rio could feel the rough slide of Agatha’s shift every time she rocked against her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio whispered. “Come for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha came with a strangled whine, and Rio followed soon after with a soft cry. They each drew out the other’s orgasm for as long as they could, and only when their breathing evened out did they finally pull away from each other. Agatha kept one hand around Rio’s neck and rested the other on the edge of the tub while Rio rested both hands on her hips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nuzzled Agatha’s neck before Agatha met her lips again in a slow kiss that made Rio feel as though she were nothing more than misshapen clay, once formed into something great and now a helpless lump. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were right,” Rio murmured once they parted. “Giving in to temptation can be pleasurable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, a sound that was sweet with its lack of performance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure you do not require another demonstration?” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned and laid back against the edge of the tub, admiring the sight of Agatha before her, soaked shift and flushed cheeks. Rio wanted to kiss her again, but she knew she would not be able to stop herself this time. She settled for letting her hands settle on Agatha’s thighs once more, stroking the soft skin with her thumbs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed in contentment. She shut her eyes for a few moments before she opened them again and said quietly, “I should go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile faded. “Your father–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He will not know,” Agatha said. “I assure you.” There was a cold certainty to her voice that made Rio pause. Agatha seemed to sense her unease because she leaned forward and kissed Rio lightly on the lips. “Trust me, my dear Nightwalker. I will not do anything to cause issues between you and my father.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As you say, my lady,” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled with a touch of annoyance, whether it was at Rio or the situation it was unclear, but she still stood. Water streamed heavily from her dress but she merely shrugged it off, allowing it to land in the tub. The sight of Agatha fully naked made Rio desperate to drag her back down, but she knew better than the risk more than they had already done. Still, it was difficult to refrain, especially with the way Agatha stretched and moved so teasingly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The maddening woman knew exactly what she was doing too, given the smirk she sent Rio over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I shall retire first,” Agatha said. She grabbed a dressing gown from one of the cabinets along the wall and slid it on. She flashed Rio a charming grin and added, “I hope to dream of you, Nightwalker.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish to hear of them if you do,” RIo replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile grew. She inclined her head. “Good night, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good night, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched the woman leave her once more. Once the door shut behind her, Rio allowed herself to sink further into the tepid water. Having sex while on the job like this, with the lord’s daughter of all people, was undoubtedly one of the most foolish things Rio could have done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Theo was right to have suggested she bring another, and yet, Rio could not bring herself to quite regret it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not yet at least.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . .</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rose with the sun the following morning, a sight she wished Theo could have witnessed himself. If only he knew how diligent Rio was being about her mission when she was not too busy having sex with pretty women in bathtubs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After dressing and departing her quarters, Rio found that only the servants were awake. All the better for Rio, who was able to escape outdoors and run through her stretches and forms with her dagger. It was something she did at least once or twice a day in the mornings and evenings. At this point, such forms were more to center Rio rather than any sort of practice. These movements were ingrained in Rio now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had redrawn her runes and gone through her forms twice when a servant came to get her for their first meal. She tried to excuse herself to freshen up, but the servant nervously informed her that Edmure insisted they begin at once. Subtly rolling her eyes, Rio entered the dining room, glistening with sweat and smelling the outdoors. She caught Edmure wrinkling his nose and suppressed a smirk as she took her seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Across from her, Agatha looked radiant in a simple white blouse and a deep purple skirt with her hair pulled back into a simple knot at the base of her neck. At her throat was the same brooch as the day before. Agatha met her gaze with a slight smile, winking when her father was not looking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thought she would regret last night after she spent an entire night dwelling on it, but the regret never came. All that prickled along Rio’s body was the need to have Agatha again. Not only that, Rio found herself eager to speak to the other woman again as well, to test herself against Agatha’s wit and intellect that was so unlike anything Rio had seen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After they finished eating, Edmure informed her, “There was no body found this morning. I had my men search the woods, and there was nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Fortune has mercy,” Rio mumbled to herself. She cleared her throat and addressed Edmure, saying, “I am glad to hear it. I shall continue my investigation by speaking with the families of the victims, if that is acceptable to you, Lord Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is,” Edmure said. “Please take Agatha with you to show my people you have our blessing to be here.” Because Nightwalkers were often seen as ill omens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Rio said. “And you have my sincerest thanks for your hospitality, my lord. If it ever becomes a burden, please allow me to reside elsewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nonsense,” Edmure assured her. “You may stay here as long as it is necessary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio said her thanks again before she left to check on her horse. It appeared Dahlia was well-cared for in the stables, and Rio was still there when Agatha came to join her. She lingered in the entryway, watching as Rio brushed her horse’s mane. Rio noticed her as soon as she arrived, but she made no sign of acknowledgement. Eventually, Agatha ventured further into the stables until she stood beside Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s beautiful,” Agatha said. She reached out to touch her, but to Rio’s surprise, Dahlia reared back fiercely. Agatha stumbled back with wide eyes while Rio rushed to calm her horse. “My apologies,” Agatha said. “I fear that horses and I have never worked well together, but I had foolishly hoped it was just my family’s steeds.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It may be due to her unfamiliarity to you,” Rio offered, but even then, she found it strange that Dahlia had reacted so violently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Giving her horse one more reassuring pat, Rio walked away to join Agatha in the corner of the stables. Here, in the back of the property with no one else around, Rio rested her hand on Agatha’s waist, smiling when Agatha leaned into her touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you sleep?” Rio asked. She leaned in, adding, “Did you dream of me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did,” Agatha replied. She rested her hands against Rio’s chest and pressed her body to hers. “Would you rather I tell you of what I dreamt or shall I show you instead?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, feeling her cheeks grow warm. “I fear that I will accomplish very little else today if I were to give in to temptation so early,” Rio said. She pressed a chaste kiss to Agatha’s cheek and said, “Let us speak to the families before we indulge in any baser desires.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were far more giving last night,” Agatha pouted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and let her lips brush lightly against Agatha’s. She whispered, “If you’re patient, I can show you just how giving I can be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she pulled back, she caught the flash of desire on Agatha’s face before she schooled it into a haughty expression. “As you say, Nightwalker,” Agatha said. “However, you should know that I do not take broken promises lightly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who says I shall be breaking any promise?” Rio replied with a raised brow. She held out her arm for Agatha to take. “Now, let us begin.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They went from house to house, speaking with each of the families to see if there was any odd behaviors that preceded the deaths of the men. As they approached each family, Agatha whispered in Rio’s, informing her all that she knew, from basic information to how long a couple was married and how many children they had to more specific information such as the fact that the husband had a gambling debt that he was hiding from his family. Each fact allowed Rio to tailor her questions to the families, seeing if there was a pattern to the men taken. It also told Rio that Agatha had been holding back yesterday.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s odd,” Rio thought aloud as they went to see the last family. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To take the men,” Rio said. “I doubt any ritual would specify the blood of only men, meaning the vampire chose these men with their own motivations at hand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it really so strange to take the men?” Agatha replied thoughtfully. “They are more often alone, are they not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is true,” Rio conceded, “but they are also stronger, and while human strength is of no matter in comparison to that of a vampire’s, it is still odd to choose the more difficult prey.” She absently adjusted her arm guards as she said, “That is why I think the vampire is a woman.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped for a moment, eyeing Rio in surprise. “A woman?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio said slowly. She watched as Agatha shook her head and resumed walking. “Does it not make sense? A woman could easily lure a man away to be killed, and more often than not, I’ve found that if a vampire is discriminately killing men, it is a woman behind it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was wry as she said, “Because they often deserve it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled and let her arm brush Rio’s as they walked up to the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The last family they were visiting was a widower, Sarah, who had a young girl named Olivia. When Sarah opened the door, she looked tired and worn, undoubtedly exhausted from trying to run both parts of the household now without her husband. She was blonde with green eyes, but the little girl who peered around her legs had dark curls and darker eyes. Rio wondered how painful it was for her to look so much like her father.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come in,” Sarah said. Her smile was feeble. Olivia stayed by his mother’s side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kept the conversation as short as possible, not wanting to take up too much of the woman’s time. There wasn’t much to discuss anyway. She more or less had the same to say as everyone else. There was nothing odd about the victim before he died. She didn’t know if she left the house the night he died. There was nothing else that came to mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for speaking with us,” Rio said, to which Sarah only nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Olivia, sitting beside her, with her legs swinging against the edge of the couch, perked up and said, “May I show them my train now? Da carved it for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Grief flickered across Sarah’s face before she said, “Of course, dear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Olivia hopped off the couch and disappeared for a moment. When she came back, there was a wooden train in her hands. Agatha grew stiff as she came closer, so Rio scooted to the edge of her chair, intercepting her before she could attempt to go to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is this?” Rio gasped, taking the train from her. “This is amazing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Da can make anything,” Olivia boasted proudly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wondered what lies Sarah told this girl that she thought his father would still come home. She swallowed the bitterness at the back of her throat and said, “Your father is very talented. Can you do the same?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yet,” Olivia said with a shake of her head. “Da said he would teach me after my tenth birthday. Knives are dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Knives are dangerous,” Rio agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Olivia tilted his head, looking at her belt. “Why do you have so many then?” Olivia asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was how Rio found herself speaking to Olivia at length about his own adventures, slaying imaginary monsters in the woods. She was a bright child and wildly creative. Rio could not help but pity her though, knowing her light would be dimmed once she found out about her father. That was what made it all the more difficult to leave, even as Olivia begged her to stay. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I cannot,” Rio said apologetically. “I must go to take care of your village.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Olivia doggedly followed her to the door. “What was it you said? That Nightwalkers say?” It had come up while Rio told Olivia of some of her own adventures as a child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“May fortune find you in favor.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“May fortune find you in favor,” Olivia repeated dutifully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My thanks,” Rio smiled. She ruffled her hair and inclined her head at Sarah before she and Agatha left the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked, Rio glanced at the other woman. Agatha had been oddly quiet the entirety of the meeting with this last family. It was not just the fact that Sarah was a widow and had a son. Two other families had widows and children. There was something else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio led them to the woods rather than back into town, and Agatha followed her without question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After they wandered the woods for a few minutes, Agatha finally spoke, commenting lightly, “You are a natural with the children.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, “I merely listen. That is all a child wants.” Vague memories of her family came to her then, shadowy figures that held her close and soothed her cuts and scratches. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was that your experience as a child?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For a time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then I listened,” Rio said. She could still remember the bitter cold that seeped into her bones as she was taken into the guild. It had been many years before that chill finally faded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What brought on this change in you, I wonder?” Agatha mused. Her playfulness crept back into her face and voice as she considered Rio’s grim expression. “Might I guess?” Without waiting for a response, she said, “Your curiosity got the better of you, and you did something you should not have. Then, you got caught and punished.” Rio’s lips ticked downwards as she shook her head again. “No? Perhaps you fell in love, a first love so sweet and pure that you longed to listen to them at all hours.” Agatha laughed, not noticing the growing tension in Rio’s shoulders. “No need to be so serious with me, Nightwalker. Was it–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My family was murdered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shut her mouth with a definitive click. She looked chastened, but Rio could not bring herself to feel remorseful for snapping so. Agatha’s probing had reminded Rio of the anniversary in a sudden, forceful way that felt akin to a blow to the head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did not answer immediately, taking a moment to breathe and steady herself. “It will be sixteen years at the start of winter,” Rio told her quietly. “I was nothing more than an orphan when the hunters’ guild took me in, and it was there that I learned to listen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took her hand, holding it tenderly. She opened her mouth to say something, but after a moment, she closed. Rio could not blame her. What could a daughter of a lord say to an orphaned hunter?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“May I take you somewhere?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever for?” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As an apology,” Agatha said, raising a brow. When Rio merely stared, her face softened as she said, “But also, it is simply something I would like to share with you.” A shy smile spread across her lips. “A secret.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mood felt as though it were spoiled now. She doubted any sort of surprise could help lessen the grief and guilt eating at her mind, but she sighed and nodded. She saw that Agatha genuinely felt guilty for her misstep, and if it would help alleviate her worry, Rio would allow her to take her wherever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their hands remained entwined as Agatha led her deeper into the woods, but it was nowhere near where they had traveled the day before. Rio was impressed Agatha seemed to know her way so well, but she suspected Agatha had snuck into the woods many times in her childhood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally drew close to their destination, Agatha said, “Close your eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do I have to?” Rio asked reluctantly. Losing her sight was not something Rio took lightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just for a moment,” Agatha said. It was not quite a plea, but her voice had taken on a wheedling quality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sighing, Rio shut her eyes. She felt Agatha’s hand tighten around hers. She waited for Agatha to pull her forward, only to be startled by a pair of lips touching hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Agatha laughed against her lips. “I couldn’t help myself. Let us go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked them forward for another minute or two before she finally said, “Open your eyes now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did as she was told, only for her breath came to a stuttering pause as she took in the clearing they were in. They stood in the center of browning grass engulfed in grand, looming trees that created halo. This was no golden heaven though; it couldn’t be when every leaf on the trees was a deep, blood red. Never before had Rio seen autumn so domineering before, as if taking claim of every inch of nature and leaving no doubt as to the coming winter. All of Rio’s previous rancor disappeared in an instant at the sight of something so rare and stunning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you like it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she looked at her, Agatha was a vision in red. The leaves clustered together behind her set her ablaze, not burning her to ashes but reminding Rio of a phoenix rising from them instead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Beautiful,” Rio murmured, unsure of whether she meant the leaves or Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled like she knew the answer though. “Shall we rest for a while?” She stepped closer to Rio, wrapping her arms around her waist. She smiled up at her coyly and said, “I believe you made a promise to me that I intend for you to follow through.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I always keep my promises,” Rio smiled. “Will you lay down for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at the ground and sighed, “I should have brought a blanket.” Nonetheless, she settled herself against the grass and stared up at Rio expectantly. “Well?” Agatha prompted her impatiently. “What are you doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Admiring the view,” Rio said playfully. She chuckled while Agatha rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lowered herself on top of Agatha, hovering over her with a hand on either side of her head. As she did, her crucifix fell from beneath the collar of her shift, hanging between them. Rio went to tuck it back in, but then Agatha hooked a finger around the chain and smirked. Her eyebrows furrowed ever so slightly, but with a firm tug, she pulled Rio closer and kissed her soundly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept one finger around the chain of Rio’s necklace, but her other slid along Rio’s back to press her closer. Rio followed the pressure of her hand, settling against her with her leg between her thighs. As their kisses grew more heated, a mess of teeth and tongue, Rio felt Agatha begin to rub herself against her thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio murmured, pulling away. Agatha’s hands fell away. She stared at Rio with knitted brows and swollen lips. Rio smiled and shifted down her body, saying, “Let me taste you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip, eyes growing wide. A strange expression crossed her face, but before Rio could parse out what it meant, Agatha nodded eagerly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew Agatha expected her to move beneath her skirts immediately, but she reached for her blouse instead. She undid the buttons swiftly, quickly followed by the hooks of her bra. Rio ducked her head and ran her tongue over nipple. She felt it grow hard under her tongue as she circled it and took it under her mouth, savoring the ragged moans Agatha let out in response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was a gorgeous creature, and it was only right that Rio worshiped her accordingly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio pushed up Agatha’s skirt, kneeling between her legs, she heard Agatha mutter, “Finally.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought ladies were meant to be patient,” Rio teased as her fingers found Agatha’s underwear. She pulled them down around her ankles, watching Agatha squirm against her. “Should I test how patient you can be?” Rio let her fingers trail through Agatha’s arousal. She was so wet that Rio groaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will find I can be more patient than you, Nightwalker,” Agatha huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm, let us see then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took her time dragging her tongue over Agatha, moaning at the taste of her. She switched between the tip and flat of her tongue, never quite touching where Agatha wanted her most. Rio could have done this for hours, tasting Agatha like this, listening to her like this. Her whines grew pitchy. Her whimpers needy. Rio continued to lick her again and again, never changing her pace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha moaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of her name on Agatha’s lips again sent a jolt down Rio’s spine. She moaned against Agatha, letting the vibrations tease her further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, please,” Agatha said finally. Her hands found Rio’s hair, pulling on the ponytail she’d done this morning. “Let me come. Please. Please, Rio. Rio–” Agatha cried out as Rio finally took her bud into her mouth. She was gentle at first, but as she slid two fingers into Agatha, she sucked hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” Agatha screamed. Her body arched as she came, fingers rough as she yanked on Rio’s hair. Agatha babbled as she rode out her pleasure, expletives mixed with Rio’s name. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio waited until Agatha relaxed to pull away, face and hands slick with her arousal. She went to grab a handkerchief to clean herself, but Agatha fisted a hand in her shirt and pulled her back down on top of her. Rio gaped as Agatha took her fingers into her mouth, sucking them clean, all while staring into Rio’s eyes. Once done with that, she kissed Rio roughly, licking her chin and face clean too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio sighed against her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you desire, Nightwalker?” Agatha asked breathlessly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It should have felt wrong to be called such a dismissive title at a time like this, but from Agatha, it sounded fond. Rio licked her lips and said, “Whatever you wish to give me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled slowly, and Rio felt as though she were about to be devoured whole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she nearly was, Agatha’s mouth at her throat with three fingers thrusting inside her just rough enough to send streaks of delicious pain through Rio. Agatha was sight to behold on top of her, and Rio could not recall a time she enjoyed being beneath another as much as she did with Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You feel so good,” Agatha whispered against her skin. She adjusted her hand, letting her thumb swipe over her bud. Rio shuddered against her, gripping her thighs so tightly she was sure they would bruise. “Unlike anyone I have touched before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kiss me,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio came with Agatha’s tongue in her mouth and her fingers in her cunt, and Rio felt so full she felt as though she might burst. Her orgasm tore through her, and Rio heard her moans echo through the woods around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha settled on top of her afterwards, head tucked under Rio’s chin, Rio felt as though she was adrift in the vastness of an unnameable ocean. Something had come untethered inside her, but Rio could not say what.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Close your eyes,” Agatha told her, running her fingers up and down Rio’s arm. “Let us rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that not what this all has been?” Rio chuckled, but still, she closed her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, for some reason, Rio felt herself grow tired and fall asleep within moments.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . .</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio awoke, it was not in a field of crimson leaves. It was in a dank cellar with her wrists chained to a stone wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio jolted up, yanking against the cold metal shackled around her wrists. Her runes had faded though, and she was left with mortal strength that kept her bound. She hissed and swung her head around, taking in her surroundings. She sat among broken furniture and chests in the dirt. It was a large space, meaning it was a large house she was trapped beneath. A bitter realization unfurled within her. Her throat felt tight, and her head began to pound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As if summoned by the thought, the cellar door creaked open. A moment later, Agatha descended the stairs, dressed once again in a black and red gown. When she drew closer, even in the dim lighting, Rio saw it. A flash of red irises and the fine points of fangs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swore under her breath. Agatha was the vampire terrorizing this village. It was so obvious. The signs had all been there. The insistence Agatha join her. The knowledge on killing vampires. The skittish nature of her horse. The strange reaction to Rio postulating the vampire was a woman. The wince at her crucifix. With anyone else, Rio would have identified the threat immediately, but with Agatha, Rio had simply not wanted to see them. Now, she was paying the price.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you enjoy your rest, Nightwalker?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clenched her jaw, glaring up at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just smiled though, not hesitating in her approach. Instead of looming over Rio or kneeling beside her, Agatha swung a leg over Rio and settled herself in her lap, just as she had the night before. Rio’s glare did not lessen as Agatha made a show of adjusting her skirt, hips heavy against hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No answer?” Agatha taunted. She used a finger to tilt Rio’s face up to hers, but Rio said nothing. Her face was set in an indignant fury. “Are you truly attempting to act stoic now, Nightwalker? After all that we have done?” She grabbed one side of her skirt and dragged it slowly up to her hip. She held it up with a hand pressed to her thigh, right above where her stockings ended. With her other hand, she pressed it against the wall, right beside Rio’s head. She leaned forward, close enough for Rio to see the flecks of green in her eyes. “Are you sure you cannot be tempted once more?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the tug in her gut and the thrum in her veins. “Using your thrall again?” Rio growled. “Even now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again?” Agatha echoed with a tilt of her head. Her eyes darted over Rio’s face for a moment before understanding dawned on her face. She pursed her lips and shook her head. “Rio, I have never put you under my thrall.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Panic shot through Rio, both at the use of her real name and the implications of Agatha’s words. Rio spat, “Liar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The only one lying here is you, to yourself,” Agatha told her. Her solemn voice and steady gaze only worsened Rio’s fears. Agatha’s hand fell from the wall to rest against her shoulder. She gave it a gentle squeeze. “Do not misunderstand,” Agatha said softly. “I intended to, the night in the bath, but there was no need to. You gave yourself to me of your own volition, just as you did in the clearing. Both times, I was prepared to, but both times, you made the choice yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio choked on any words that she tried to form. Her eyes were wide, desperate to find any kind of sign that Agatha was manipulating her once more, but Rio knew she told the truth. She had been drawn to a creature that should not exist. Agatha broke every rule Rio thought she knew. She couldn’t breathe. How could she reconcile the stark attraction she’d experienced with the deep disgust that coursed through her very being?</span>
</p><p>
<span>How could Rio have allowed herself to do this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did something to me,” Rio tried, but her voice was quiet and weak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Agatha replied. There was a hint of pity in her voice now. “Because I am what you revile?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You go against the very laws of nature,” Rio told her, trying to ground herself in what she knew to be true. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We all go against nature sometimes,” Agatha shrugged, but there was still an odd seriousness in her eyes. “Some would say you do too, lying with women.” To this, Rio had nothing to say, and Agatha merely sighed. “You should know that I would not have used my thrall to bed you, merely to incapacitate you once you relaxed, but I will confess to using it on everyone else,” Agatha said. When Rio’s eyes snapped back to her, Agatha smiled faintly. “I have your attention now, do I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Explain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is how it sounds,” Agatha said. “The village is under my thrall. Every single one of them. Not an easy accomplishment, I assure you, but the years have been kind to me and taught me much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even your father,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not my father,” Agatha corrected, “but Edmure has been a useful pawn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mind raced to grapple with what Agatha was telling her. “That means you had him send the letters. You brought me here on purpose. Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is something of yours I require,” Agatha told her. She gripped Rio’s chin firmly now. “Blood.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could not have known they would send me,” Rio argued. When Agatha merely raised a brow, Rio ground her teeth and pointed out, “You had plenty of blood before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yours,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried in vain to free herself from Agatha’s grip. She met her gaze with a venomous glare, but behind Agatha, Rio dragged her boot through the dirt. “And what of mine is worth this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Surprise flickered across Agatha’s face. Her grip loosened enough for Rio to pull away, but Agatha’s reaction held Rio still. “You do not know,” Agatha murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s foot hesitated before it resumed its movement. “Know what?” Rio demanded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A history,” Agatha said vaguely. “Now, hold still for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wished she could say she’d thrashed about and fought like hell to keep Agatha away, but instead, she did not move at all when Agatha leaned forward. Her breath caressed Rio’s throat in a way that felt all too familiar, just moments before her fangs sank into her. Rio expected the sting, but the hazy pleasure that followed was different. Of course, Rio knew that a vampire’s venom was meant to keep victims pliant, but she did not expect it to be so enjoyable. Her body relaxed completely, falling slack against the wall. It took all of Rio’s concentration to keep her foot moving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After piercing her neck, Agatha did not drink from her. She licked her lips as she pulled away, but all she did was press a vial to Rio’s neck, gathering the blood that pooled there. She met Rio’s eyes for a moment. She looked as though she were to speak, but then she merely shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio waited until Agatha capped the vial and licked the wound close before she spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You should know,” Rio rasped. “I am not so easily restrained.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that so?” Agatha asked with a pointed look at the shackles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio smiled viciously. “You should be more observant.” She nodded behind Agatha, and when she turned, Rio pulled her foot away, revealing the rune she’d drawn with her heel in the dirt. Before Agatha could react, Rio stamped her foot on top of the rune, activating it. In a flash of white light, strength surged through Rio, allowing her to rip the shackles from the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dizzy as she was, Rio knocked Agatha to the ground with ruthless intent, pinning her wrists to the ground. Runes carved into a separate entity rather than the skin would not last nearly as long. She had to make this worth it for as long as she had the increased strength. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s back had barely hit the ground though before she flung her body forward, smacking her head against Rio’s face. The pain and rush of blood disoriented Rio. It gave Agatha enough of an opening to roll on top of her with a hand at her throat. Rio knew Agatha could crush her windpipe in an instant, but the way she held Rio’s throat was not meant to properly kill someone. This was nothing more than a taunt. Arousal and fury flooded Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A feral grin stretched Rio’s lips as she grabbed a knife still strapped to her belt. She aimed for Agatha’s shoulder, but Agatha caught her wrist and slammed it to the ground before it could reach her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do not do this,” Agatha told her. Both hands squeezed, just tight enough that Rio gasped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to,” Rio said. This was what she was meant to do. Kill vampires. If she did not do that, her life lost its meaning. She could not simply turn her back on all she knew. Not for a woman she barely knew, not for a vampire who fooled her so heartlessly. Rio let out a ragged, hysterical laugh. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands loosened, just a fraction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sudden possessiveness nearly made Agatha let go entirely, giving Rio the chance to shove Agatha back into the ground. She held Agatha’s arms to her sides with her legs and kept her hand on her chest as extra security. There was no rhythm beneath her palm, and Rio felt her breath catch at another reminder of what Agatha was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand trembled as she pressed the blade to Agatha’s throat. When Agatha swallowed, the dagger nicked the skin, drawing a thin line of blood. She could end Agatha’s life right now. She should end Agatha’s life right now. All she had to do was cut off her head or take the stake from her belt and plunge it though her heart. It was something Rio had done hundreds of times, but her hand could not stop shaking as she stared down at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bright blue eyes unflinchingly met her gaze, and Rio felt her heart thud against her chest, fast and hard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should kill you,” Rio said aloud, hoping that saying the words would force her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then do it,” Agatha said. There was not a trace of fear in her face or voice. “Many would say you have the right, after being so thoroughly deceived.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed. Her grip tightened around the knife. “Was it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Speak clearly, Nightwalker,” Agatha replied, dripping with condescension. Rio was tempted to stab her right then. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was it all a deception?” Rio asked. She had to know. She had to know if she really was so fooled by a vampire’s lies. Rio remembered the way Agatha had looked at her. She remembered the way Agatha had touched and tasted her. She needed to know. “Was there not one moment of truth between us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their eyes met, and Rio swallowed hard at what she found. Crystal blue eyes that shone but gave no hint as to what she was thinking. How many others had found their death while staring into these eyes?</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finally spoke, it was quiet and begrudging. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In the clearing,” Agatha said. Her eyes flicked away for a moment. “I did want to show you it, truly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why bother?” Rio asked. She dug the blade in, but Agatha did not even wince. She leaned down until their noses could touch. “Why show it to me if you were just going to use me like this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I thought you would like it,” Agatha finally snapped. “What other reason is there to be had?” She craned her head up, regardless of the fact that it drew more blood. “Why do you want to know so badly?” Agatha whispered against her lips. Before Rio could answer, she pressed her lips to hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss should not have been a surprise, given Agatha’s manipulations, but it still shocked Rio enough to allow Agatha to send her flying into the wall. Rio grunted as she hit the stone before landing on the ground. She pushed herself onto her knees to find Agatha already standing at the top of the stairs. Rio knew once Agatha walked out she had no hope of catching up to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will hunt you down,” Rio snarled. “That’s a promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flashed. She undoubtedly remembered the way Rio said she kept her promises.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I look forward to seeing you try, Nightwalker.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, she was gone, leaving Rio in a cellar with the press of her kiss still a faint feeling on her lips.</span>
