<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal didn’t choose the city of Westview based on a particular rationale. She’d spent her life in a small college town twenty minutes south of Chicago and left in the middle of the night a week ago. Something rattled inside her and snapped, and she simply couldn’t stomach being near her ex-lover any longer. She remembered everything about the night she left Evette.</p><p>Rio had returned home late one night, overcome with guilt, her hands trembling from the touch of another woman.</p><p>“I knew it,” Evette had said. “<em>I knew it</em>.” She asked why Rio had done it.</p><p>It was only a kiss, she’d said, knowing it was a lie. “I don’t think I can do this anymore.”</p><p>“How could you do this to me?” Evette cried.</p><p>She couldn’t muster anything beyond standing there, frozen, unable to speak. Her mind had flashed back to the burgeoning resentment that had spread like poison every time Evette chose her friends, her career, and herself over Rio. But she didn’t have a leg to stand on after a betrayal like this. Nothing would make it okay.</p><p>Rio wanted to say it was out of character to lie and cheat on Evette, but at this point—she didn’t know herself anymore. They’d been together since she’d turned thirty and spent nearly ten years together, and she threw it away one night for a woman she met at the pub. It was the first time in five years that she felt <em>seen</em>, though not loved. She’d set their relationship ablaze with a callousness that shook her to flesh and bone.</p><p>Evette didn’t deserve this, even if their relationship was dead in the water for so long, like flotsam.</p><p>So, Rio moved out and spent a few days on an acquaintance’s couch, only to realize there was nothing left for her there. No friends, no lovers, no family. It was too easy to leave. She was a handywoman by trade and never had trouble finding a job.</p><p>Westview called for her, drawing her into its foggy, thick air and grassy hills. It was a town of merely two thousand people, and she was replacing one of only a few mechanics like herself. Rio drove straight there and signed a cheap lease over email for a quaint, verdant one-story house in a neighborhood on the fringes of town.</p><p>She saw pictures, and there was no evidence of water damage, mold, pests, or sordid crime, so she didn’t ask questions. The neighborhood didn’t have a name and encompassed just eleven storybook houses. Five on each side of Witches’ Road, across from one another, slightly off-kilter, and one lone house at the end of the road.</p><p>It was Monday morning, and the whistle of a frigid breeze crept up on Rio, waking her in a cold sweat. She cursed to herself and sat up, and then dragged herself to the kitchen and made a pot of stale coffee.</p><p>Half-unpacked boxes and plastic bins lined the bedroom, living room, and dining room, along with the mix of softer midcentury pieces she’d acquired over the years. Her house resided in disarray, just as she did.</p><p>She brushed her teeth and clipped herself into a pair of navy coveralls, hovering at her bedroom window, poking her finger through the blinds. Rio watched the eerie calm of the neighborhood, listening for any semblance of life. The blinds in each house’s windows remained shuttered, and as still as a calm lake day. A dog howled every few minutes, and mourning doves cooed like gentle alarm clocks.</p><p>The lone house at the end of the road loomed over the rest of the houses, with a drooping thatch roof, diamond windows of odd, mismatched sizes, and an arched front door. It was an electric violet and the first thing Rio noticed about the house. Ivy crawled up the brick foundation of the house, punctuated with amethyst bellflowers.</p><p>The blueprint Rio had peered at online made the house seem much larger than it was. There was a field of tall grasses and wildflowers behind the house, like flames.</p><p>She sat down in the dining room, babysitting a cup of coffee and a piece of toast while she tabbed through her laptop to see what was on the docket of repairs today.</p><p>Two HVAC cleanings, one screen door replacement, and three gutter cleanings. It was that time of year.</p><p>Rio made a list of tools and components she needed and finished her breakfast. On her way out of the house, she shimmied into a flannel jean jacket and hid under a baby blue corduroy baseball cap. Her father had given it to her before he passed, and he’d worn a matching cap. He was also a handyman and hobbyist woodworker, and she’d grown up in his workshop, tinkering with chisels and saws and routers.</p><p>Her mother disapproved of how “masculine” her interests were, but eventually, she relented when she saw how much Rio loved fixing things. Rio called her mother every three to six months, chasing the distance growing between them. Her father was the glue of the family, and it’d become painfully apparent.</p><p>Rio stopped by Westview Hardware &amp; Lumber, colloquially known in town as “Your Future Tools” because of the owner’s uncanny ability to foresee everything needed for the job with just a few questions. A bell rang above her head as she swung the door open and stepped into the store, lit with warm light. It was a welcome change from the harsh fluorescent light Rio had grown accustomed to at places like Home Depot and Lowes.</p><p>“Welcome in,” a velvety voice called. “My name is Lilia Calderu. If there’s anything I can help you with, you just let me know.”</p><p>Craning her neck around the fasteners aisle, Rio caught a glimpse of a woman with curly gray hair atop her head, clad in olive-toned dungarees and a yellow knit cardigan.</p><p>“Hang on,” Lilia said, “You’re the new handyperson in town. Rio Vidal, right?”</p><p>Screws in hand, Rio emerged from the aisle and followed Lilia’s voice. She stood behind the counter. “Uhm, yes?” Her furrowed brow betrayed her next question.</p><p>“Everyone knows everyone’s business around here,” Lilia said. “So, I heard you moved onto the Witches’ Road, into Herb’s old house.”</p><p>“Yeah, I did,” Rio said. “So, do you know why it’s so cheap to rent in that neighborhood? Everything else here was at least twice as expensive.”</p><p>Lilia put on her glasses and took out the newspaper crossword, with a pen in hand. “God, I love newcomers.” She wrote the word “MAGICK” in perfect script letters. “Nobody wants to live on the Witches’ Road because bad fortune seems to follow those folks. But I think the real reason is because Agatha Harkness lives there, at the big house at the end of the road.”</p><p>The name was so particular and so unique that it struck Rio in the chest. She wouldn’t forget such a name. “Agatha Harkness?” she repeated. “Who is she?”</p><p>“A witch, with a capital ‘B,’” Lilia scoffed. “She’s just downright nasty. She’s the meanest woman in town. She’s obstructive to town officials and they can never get her to tend that jungle she calls a lawn. She’s very tetchy about her land. She’ll shoot you if you get too close to that field in her backyard.” Rio leaned on the counter and took inventory of the door hinges.</p><p>“And that’s just the beginning.” Lilia clicked her pen in. “Some years ago, there was a bigshot land developer—Mephisto, I think—and he was going to buy Agatha’s house and land for double the value. He said there were mineral deposits or maybe oil there that they wanted to tap. She refused the offer.”</p><p>“Well,” Rio said, “that is her right, <em>right</em>?”</p><p>“Sure. Listen, I’m not a big proponent of suckling Mother Earth’s teat dry but then this guy offered a ten million dollar grant to the town if she’d give up her house. They even offered her a larger house in a nicer area near the town square. And she told them to go fuck themselves. Nobody has ever offered to invest in Westview like that. And nobody has come back since.”</p><p>“Jesus.” Ten million dollars in a town like this would’ve transformed it. The schools, the hospitals, the roads, the power plant, the town square. All of it. However, the amenities weren’t in terrible shape–the roads had recently been repaved, their power grid was transitioning to wind and nuclear energy, and the high school just built a new gym.</p><p>“And she doesn’t let anyone near her land. She pulled a gun on the Kaplan boys just last month.”</p><p>Rio shivered at the thought. Agatha sounded like a nightmare to deal with. She hoped she’d never have to cross paths with her. As long as Rio minded her own business, she could build a life here in Westview. She browsed the rest of the store for her items and went back up to the counter.</p><p>“Who are the door hinges for?” Lilia asked as she scanned each item, placing them into a brown paper bag.</p><p>At first, Rio hesitated. Usually, this type of information was private, but this town would find out anyway. “Sarah Proctor. Needs a screen door replacement.”</p><p>“Yeah, you might want to pick up some stucco patch. The front of the Proctors’ house is practically crumbling. That’s why that damn screen door takes such a beating.”</p><p>Rio took her word for it and bought a bucket of stucco patch, before slipping into her truck. She took a deep breath and gripped the steering wheel, ready to face the day.</p>

<p>The week went by quickly and when Rio’s head hit her pillow, she dove into an immovable slumber every night. Every day after finishing up jobs, she’d unpack little by little, setting the coffee table, arranging books into the built-in shelves in the living room, and attaching shelves in the primary bathroom.</p><p>She’d met a few neighbors while she was out and about. Dennis, the mailman, lived in the house across from hers, which was convenient. Mr. and Mrs. Davis lived in the first house on the road, and they’d stopped by with a welcome fruit basket.</p><p>She woke from a nightmare again. She’d dreamt of laying on Evette’s chest, buried in her red hair, clutching onto her before her body disintegrated into black slush in her hands. She couldn’t help but feel she deserved such a fate in that nightmare.</p><p>She jumped into a pair of lavender coveralls and wore her dark hair in a top knot. Her overgrown bangs fell into her eyes, and she tucked them behind her ears. Her routine was set: stare out the window, make shitty coffee, toast bread, and then check the docket.</p><p>Today, it was toilet repair, deck maintenance, and window replacement.</p><p>She enjoyed her job; every day was a different set of problems to fix, and each problem varied in severity and urgency. The part Rio liked most was talking to her fellow townspeople and getting to see the interior of their lives. Being inside someone’s home was strangely intimate. She had a front-row seat to peoples’ insecurities, their familial conflicts, their innermost secrets they didn’t think she could see (she’d found Mr. Davis's secret bank account on his desk while she replaced the drawer slides).</p><p>She stopped by the hardware store and dropped a donut off at Lilia’s counter while she checked out. They were fast friends.</p><p>She finished installing new boards on the Tandons’ deck by nightfall and grabbed a takeout order at Jen’s.</p><p>“You should stop by for a beer sometime, Rio!” she called out to her. “Always in and out of here in such a rush.”</p><p>The truth was Rio was exhausted. She threw herself into this work so she could outrun the ghosts of her past. But it always caught up to her when she returned to her empty house and the guilt seeped into her stomach, making her queasy.</p><p>Still sweaty from the job, she peeled the top half of her coveralls off and tied the sleeves around her waist. She unloaded her dad’s old, reliable miter saw from the truck bed into a shelf in the mudroom. The room was neatly organized by hand tools, fasteners, power saws, drills, specialty power tools, and lumber. Rio feasted on the fries and burger and peeked into her fridge mindlessly.</p><p>She popped open a cold beer and chugged for a second before the doorbell rang. She looked down at her watch. It was 9 PM. The doorbell rang two more times, and then three times in frantic succession. What the hell was so urgent?</p><p>Rio groaned. “I’m coming! Jeez.” She wiped her fingers with a napkin. The doorbell rang again and again. She ripped the door open. “What?!”</p><p>“Hey!” A woman with distant, cerulean blue eyes stood in her doorway. Her rich, hickory-colored hair fell upon her shoulders in unkempt waves. She was clearly panicked, wearing only a floral back robe, and barefoot. “You’re a handywoman, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s right.” Rio’s mouth lugged behind her brain, which short-circuited at the sight of this bewilderingly gorgeous woman. Her cheekbones keen, her nose wise, her lips relentless.</p><p>“I have a leak somewhere in the wall and I need you to come fix it <em>now</em>,” she commanded.</p><p>“What?” Earth met Rio’s feet at once. She shook herself into focus.</p><p>“Let’s <em>go</em>.” She turned and motioned for her to follow.</p><p>Rio threw on a pair of sneakers, grabbed her tool bag, and trailed after her. “Did you turn off the main water supply?”</p><p>“Do you think I’m a moron? Of course, I did,” the woman said. “Would I resort to <em>this</em> if I hadn’t already tried that?”</p><p>A pang of anger rose in Rio’s chest. She hated working with folks like this—angry, unreasonable, and entitled. “You’d be surprised by the average homeowner.” They passed three houses and reached the end of the road. A new sense of dread washed over Rio when she watched the woman skitter up the mossy path to <em>that </em>arched purple door. “So, you’re Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>And goddamn it, she was hot.</p><p>Agatha turned around, whipping her robe around. There was something darkly theatrical about her. “Oh, don’t tell me Lilia got to you so soon.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. “Where’s the leak?” She tightened the sleeves around her waist. She followed Agatha past the living room and into the dining room. A coppery water stain grew on the wall behind the buffet cabinet. “Oh.” She reached for the door on the adjoining wall.</p><p>Agatha seized her wrist. “What do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>Rio tore her hand away. “Is this a bathroom?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I gotta get in there,” she said, nearly body-checking Agatha. She went into the bathroom and opened the sink cabinet. Reaching forward, she turned two valves clockwise until they were tight. Then, she went back to the water-damaged area of the wall, prodding it with her fingers when the drywall gave, forming a hole. If she let it sit any longer, this would become a much bigger problem. She grabbed a handsaw from her tool bag and plunged it into the wall.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing?” Agatha said, tone dripping with vitriol.</p><p>“I gotta find the leak. Go get some towels.” Rio removed a piece of drywall about the size of a bread box.</p><p>Agatha disappeared into the hallway. Her house smelled of pine and bergamot, and it was unexpectedly cozy. It was lived in. Almost endearing. A throw blanket sprawled across the couch, a pan full of pasta on the stove, a pair of boots in the kitchen, and books scattered on the dining room table. She reappeared and lobbed rough, worn towels at Rio’s feet.</p><p>Making quick work with controlled movements and elbow grease, Rio managed to find the leak and seal it with a plumber's putty. Water trickled down her arm and onto her white tank. “Do you have a big fan?”</p><p>“What? That’s it? That’s all you’re going to do?” Agatha's eyes widened, incredulously. “There’s a fucking hole in the wall, lady!”</p><p>“First, my name is Rio, thanks for asking,” she said, keeping her cool demeanor. “And second, we gotta let the inside of the wall dry or it’ll get moldy in there. That’ll take at least the rest of the night.” Agatha groaned and rolled her eyes. “When it’s dry, then you can replace that part of the pipe.”</p><p>“Me?” She crossed her arms.</p><p>“Or you could hire someone.” It was all too easy to become ensnared in this coy game of wills. Rio’s nose itched with guilt, scrunching momentarily. Was she <em>really </em>flirting with Agatha Harkness of all people over a leaky pipe? It came over her like a monsoon.</p><p>“So, you do it, then. I’ll pay you,” she said like it was a business transaction. “But I won’t pay more than a thousand for this.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said, packing up her bag. On her way out, she said, “Put in a ticket for me.” She strolled out the front door and shut it behind her. The start of something dangerous prickled up Rio’s spine and neck as she departed the uneven path in front of Agatha’s house. That feeling of single-minded, unforgiving, and hell-bent obsession and fascination. Rio knew herself. And she knew she wouldn’t stop thinking about Agatha Harkness any time soon.</p>

<p>Rio rose early the next morning, glued against her headboard with a laptop in bed. She dug through the internet, which was sluggish here, for anything and everything about Agatha Harkness. She needed to know more. She was reluctant to write anyone off based on town gossip.</p><p>There was more to her than that spiny façade; Rio could feel it rippling underneath, instinctually. She had to know more before she made any sort of judgment.</p><p>Who was she, really? Where did she come from? What was she hiding?</p><p>Rio dug through <em>The Westview Times</em> and didn’t learn anything new:</p><p>“Mephisto Leaves Westview for Good”</p><p>“It’s Time to Ask Westview: Is Agatha Harkness Good Enough to Stay?”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness Rejects Ten Million Dollars on Behalf of Westview”</p><p>“Witches’ Road Dispute Turns Violent: Local Woman Arrested for Vandalism”</p><p>Agatha had a bit of a violent and unpredictable streak, too. She’d threatened trespassing townsfolk with a gun, she’d smashed someone’s car windows with a bat, and she’d gotten arrested for drunken intoxication. Rio chuckled at the last one–she’d been arrested on more than one occasion for being a drunken fool.</p><p>The woman was unhinged, but when Rio had seen her last night, she seemed maddeningly human. Nothing close to the town’s mythology.</p><p>She scrolled through archives and came across an Evanora Harkness. Arrested for child abuse and spent a few stints in jail regularly. And then it stopped about twenty years ago. A pit in Rio’s stomach formed and bile crawled up her chest, burning. That must’ve been her mother.</p><p>And she could only assume that Agatha was the unnamed child in those articles.</p><p>Her laptop dinged with today’s docket. It was a light day. The Solis’ needed a few outlets tested and rewired and John Lee needed to re-mulch his lawn. And nothing from Agatha, of course. Rio poked her tongue in her cheek, unfazed. “Have fun with that leak,” she mumbled. Perhaps she was searching for mystery in a woman who wasn’t that mysterious. Perhaps she really was as she appeared: bitter and cantankerous.</p><p>It was an uncharacteristically warm day, so Rio broke out a pair of green overalls and a dark green cropped tee. She jumped in her truck and made her rounds.</p><p>At the hardware store, she chose a pack of GFCI outlets and generic white plates for them. The Solis’ weren’t picky.</p><p>“Get over here,” Lilia whispered to her from the corner of her cherry lips. She smiled bashfully at another customer in the power tool aisle.</p><p>Rio shot her a side-eye. “What?”</p><p>“I heard you went to Agatha Harkness’ house <em>last night</em>.” Lilia raised an eyebrow to the ceiling.</p><p>“Yeah, she had a water leak in the wall,” Rio said, shrugging. “By the way, you didn’t tell me she was—attractive.”</p><p>“Well, there’s nothing attractive about her attitude,” she said. “So, what was it like?”</p><p>“What was what like?”</p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes. “The inside of her house, Rio. Nobody has been in there for years and she just invites you in.”</p><p>“I don’t know. It was more normal than I thought it would be. She likes mid-century modern furniture and earth tones.”</p><p>“Don’t let that fool you. She went absolutely ballistic on the last handyman in her house.” “What did he do?” Rio asked. She assumed the worst.</p><p>Lilia checked to see if the coast was clear and leaned closer. “Well, he was fixing something in her kitchen and he went out back to smoke. And then she went nuts and kicked him off the premises. Hasn’t let a handyperson near her house since.”</p><p>Rio sucked air between her teeth. “Maybe he did something.”</p><p>“Be careful around her, Rio. I’m serious.” She rang up her items and pushed a paper bag across the counter.</p><p>Rio put her hands up. “Okay, I hear you.” She bounded out the door and into her truck.</p><p>She switched through the radio stations on the way to the Solis' house. She couldn’t stew in silence for more than a few seconds, couldn’t be alone with her thoughts. Was that what this newfound obsession was? Was she latching onto anything she could find to avoid contending with that horrible sinking feeling in the core of her being?</p><p>There had been a chasm forming in her ribcage for years, even before she met Evette, and it broke open when she left her. Now it was simply a void.</p><p>She snapped back to reality as she neared the long, grassy driveway up to the Solis’ house.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>After Rio finished rewiring the Solis’ outlets, she ventured to All Things Green, the local plant nursery. She gathered a handful of fall flowers and vegetables: purple aster, hot pink dahlias, garlic, parsnips, and brussel sprouts. She ordered twenty bags of mulch, heaved them into the truck bed, and arrived at John Lee’s house. He lived in a neighborhood only ten minutes away from her house. His lawn consisted mostly of unkempt grasses, shrubbery, and a spotty layer of mulch.</p><p>John was an older Chinese man with kind eyes, lounging on the porch with a cup of steaming tea. “Would you like a cup of tea?”</p><p>Rio wasn’t used to her clients being so familiar. In the city, most of her clients pointed to the problem, grumbled, and then left her alone. “Sure. Do you have green tea?”</p><p>“Of course.” He winked at her. Within a few moments, she was ankle-deep in mulch, tearing each bag open with brute strength. He emerged from the front door with a squat periwinkle mug and set it on the flat part of his porch baluster.</p><p>She finished spreading and flattening the mulch efficiently and sipped on her tea every few minutes as she raked stray mulch from the tall grasses.</p><p>John thanked her, taking her hand warmly and shaking it. Then, he slipped cash into her palm and patted her shoulder.</p><p>Instantly, she saw her dad, with tufts of gray hair peeking out of his sky-blue baseball cap, sporting a toothy grin. When Rio was a teenager, she’d join him in the workshop and work back to back, with one on the bandsaw and one on the belt sander. Within the blink of an eye, he lay motionless in his casket, his lips whitewashed, and she was almost forty years old.</p><p>“Are you alright?” John asked.</p><p>She stuttered. “Yeah. Have a good evening, Mr. Lee. I appreciate the tip.”</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>Rio arrived home around 5 PM with five extra bags of mulch. She surveyed her front lawn, which Herb had kept weeded and clean.</p><p>There were a few areas of uneven mulch around the blue elderberry and ruby salmonberry growing in a zig-zag in front of the house. Digging around in the front pocket of her overalls, she clutched onto a Swiss army knife. It was a Christmas gift from her mother. She slashed each bag open and dumped the mulch in a heap.</p><p>As she spread the mulch with a rake, a rolled newspaper pelted her in the back. “Ow! What the fuck?” Rio whipped around, lasering in on the source. The rake slipped from her hands.</p><p>Agatha stood ten feet away, with her arms crossed against a crisp white shirt tucked into a pair of barrel-legged indigo trousers. “Where the hell have you been?”</p><p>“<em>Ouch</em>.” Rio picked up the newspaper and shook it at Agatha. “What the hell is your problem?” She had just started to forget about Agatha, putting the blossoming obsession to bed.</p><p>“Where have you been all day? I came by this morning and again around noon.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darted left and right. “I’ve been working.” Then the lightbulb flickered on. Had Agatha expected her to come over to fix that damned pipe today? “I didn’t see a ticket come in this morning. Figured you called someone else.” She thrust her tongue into the inside of her bottom lip.</p><p>Agatha approached, clomping like a horse up the path in emerald Chelsea boots. Rio’s grip tightened around the newspaper. “Can you just fix it?”</p><p>With each word, Rio gestured with the newspaper at Agatha’s nose. “Put. A. Ticket. In.”</p><p>She caught the newspaper suddenly and wrenched it from Rio’s hand. “Do you have copper couplings? I assume you do since you do…” She motioned to the mess of mulch on Rio’s knees and chin. “...this.”</p><p>Rio crouched back down for the rake and continued.</p><p>Agatha strutted past Rio before she could answer, towards the front door. She reached for the handle before Rio leaped from the mulch, scurrying in front of her. She grabbed Agatha by the waist, close to her hips, with her mulch-kissed fingers.</p><p>A gasp escaped Agatha’s mouth. “My <em>shirt</em>!”</p><p>They both looked down at her white shirt, now sullied with mulch. Rio unhanded her waist.</p><p>She wasn’t afraid to get in peoples’ faces when she had to–this was something she learned in this field when men tried to intimidate her. But this felt different. This feeling swung between the precipice of a storm and something strangely invigorating. Agatha stumbled back with both hands in the air, as if they were made of glass.</p><p>“Relax, J Crew,” Rio snapped. “Let’s call it even, since you assaulted me with the thickest newspaper I’ve ever seen and you tried to enter my house like you own it. Other people might let you walk all over them, but I’m not one of them.”</p><p>Agatha ignored her and pulled out her phone.</p><p>“What are you–”</p><p>She held up one finger in Rio’s face.</p><p>“I’m talking to you–”</p><p>“I just sent a ticket into your little system,” Agatha said, pursing her lips. “I booked you for ten minutes from now, so if you could just confirm that—”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flared and she waved her off. “Fine. I’ll see you in ten minutes.” Just when she thought she wanted to know everything about Agatha, she transformed into an albatross clinging to her neck, and she couldn’t wait to peel her off and fling her away. Rio just had to get the job over with.</p>

<p>Rio threw pipe cutters, copper couplings, and crimpers into a tool bag and arrived at Agatha’s front door. She knocked once.</p><p>	Agatha opened the door with bored, jaded eyes and a fresh shirt on. She opted for a dark wash chambray. “Hey.” She was hard to read; it was unclear whether she was simmering with fury or simply tired.</p><p>	Rio shuffled past her into the dining room and got to work. Agatha watched her from the kitchen, hovering over a sizzling pan. Her watchful eye seared into Rio’s back as she cut through the section of pipe with putty on it. The silence grew, like an awkward, lanky teen. </p><p>	“Agatha,” Rio said, “what do you do for a living?”</p><p>	Agatha looked up from the pan, cocking her head to the right. “Excuse me?” The aromatic smell of garlic and chives permeated the air.</p><p>	“What do you do for a living?” Rio repeated.</p><p>They lived only a few houses away from each other—Rio could either make nice or ruin her own life on the Witches’ Road by making an enemy out of Agatha Harkness. She chose to overlook the incident from earlier.</p><p>	“I’m in ops at a small company,” she said, without pretense. She sighed and reached up into her cabinet for salt and pepper. </p><p>	“Do you like your job?” Rio bit her lip and removed a section of copper pipe. She rummaged around in her tool bag for a pair of copper couplings. </p><p>	“It’s fine. I don’t hate it and they’ll never lay me off.” She tucked a strand of wavy hair behind her ear pensively. </p><p>Rio’s gaze lingered for a moment.</p><p>	She cut about an inch off each side of the remaining pipe in the wall. “So, what do you do outside of work?”</p><p>	Agatha dropped the pan down on the glass stovetop and scoffed. “What are you doing? Why are you asking all these questions? Did someone put you up to this?”</p><p>	“I’m just trying to be neighborly,” Rio said. </p><p>	“Oh, really? No ulterior motive? You didn’t hear from that blabbermouth Lilia? Or Jen? She absorbs all the town gossip and keeps it on tap at the bar.”</p><p>	Rio fit the copper couplings onto the cutout pipe and crimped them on each side, effectively sealing them together. “I’ve heard things about you, but I thought I’d get to know you before I start believing any of it,” she said. </p><p>She fastened two pieces of plywood to the inside of the square hole in the wall. Then, she fastened a sheet of drywall to the wood, making it perfectly flush with the wall. “Sue me,” Rio said, raising her eyebrows at the wall. </p><p>	Agatha’s blue eyes ticked onto her, zeroing in like a sniper. “And what have you heard?” </p><p>	Rio deflected. There was no way she could tactfully answer. </p><p>“Nothing worth mentioning.” She measured the twinge of annoyance across Agatha’s curled lips. </p><p>Rio’s stomach flipped and fluttered. “Though, if they’d mentioned your eclectic taste in decor, I might’ve been more inclined to ulterior motives.” She fought the urge to grin at Agatha. She drilled through Agatha’s steely eyes, catching a glimmer of surprise. </p><p>Agatha hadn’t expected a compliment.</p><p>Drywall knife in hand, Rio pointed to the buffet cabinet she’d moved aside to get to the wall. “Where did you get this? Is that acacia?” She wanted to run her fingers against the vertical grooves lining the front of the cabinet. </p><p>“Yeah, it is acacia. Good eye,” Agatha said. She cleared her throat. “It’s my mother’s.” She rolled her sleeves up and grabbed a pair of tongs from the railing on the wall, her whole body stiffening. </p><p>It was as if someone had sucked all the warmth out of the air. </p><p>“Is it a family heirloom?” Rio applied joint compound over the seams of the patch and wiped her knife with a paper towel. </p><p>“No.” </p><p>Rio sensed that it was time to go. Of course—her <em>mother</em>. Her ghastly, abusive mother. That was probably the last thing Agatha wanted to talk about. Rio bit the inside of her cheek, blaming herself. “I’m all done here. Just let this set and paint over the patch.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and walked her to the front door. </p><p>“I’ll send you an invoice,” Rio said over her shoulder on the way out.</p><p>“Rio,” she said.</p><p>Rio turned around.</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha gave her a knowing nod. </p><p>Even though she froze her out, that dangerous feeling reignited in Rio’s chest and it wouldn’t burn out any time soon.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	That night, Rio slept easy. Agatha’s voice echoed around in her skull, saying her name over and over. The way her voice had become shallow when Rio mentioned her mother illuminated a different side of her. That side of her felt more honest, more real. </p><p>	Rio spent her day off exploring Westview. She went to the town square and bought fresh produce from the market. She enjoyed a cup of tea at a storefront bench, watching a man with a cowboy hat strum a steel-string guitar and croon through his nose at the fountain in the middle of the brick-paved square. </p><p>By evening, she ended up at Jen’s. The bar was covered in rich, storied walnut: dark and brooding floors, counters, booths, chairs, tables, and wall paneling. The wood swallowed up the daylight. The ceiling was covered in ornate, forest-green Baroque tiles. </p><p>Rio settled at the bar, leaning on the left side of her body, her right leg planted on the floor, half-standing. </p><p>	She ordered cider and street tacos. </p><p>Jen swung through the doors. She wore a dusty pink jumpsuit with a delicate gold chain necklace, which popped against her warm, dark skin. “How are the tacos treating you? We’re trying out some new items on the menu.”</p><p>	Through a mouthful of steak, onion, tomato, and cilantro, Rio flashed a thumbs up. “Keep it on the menu.” </p><p>	“You clean up nice. This whole ensemble is working for you,” Jen said, her hand tracking up and down Rio’s outfit. </p><p>When she wasn’t in her work clothes, she gravitated toward a dark, earthy palette. She wore an emerald green corduroy shirt over a sleeveless black turtleneck with a pair of olive straight-leg pants.</p><p>	Rio thanked her. </p><p>Jen wiped the counter down and narrowed her eyes at Rio. “So, you’re single, right?”</p><p>	Rio gulped down a bite and nodded. “But I’m–I’m not really looking for anything serious right now. I’m not even sure if I’m looking for anything at all. I don’t know. It’s–it’s complicated. Why?” </p><p>	“Really just looking for a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’” She continued. “We do pretty regular events at the bar and the singles are ready to mingle. You’re shiny and new, and pleasant-looking, so turnout would be <em>good</em> for you and for my pockets.”</p><p>	“Yeah, I don’t know. I’m not really ready to date anyone, even casually,” Rio said. All of her history with Evette rushed back to the surface. </p><p>	“So, hook up with the singles. Keep them sane,” Jen quipped. “You don’t have to date to mate.” </p><p>	Rio’s nose wrinkled at the phrase, but she understood the sentiment. She shivered at the thought of touching another woman after what she’d done to Evette. And she got away scot-free. She picked up and moved away without looking back, like a coward. </p><p>	“Rio?” Jen said. “Are you down?” </p><p>	She landed back in reality. “Eh, I don’t know.” </p><p>	“Just think about it, okay?” Jen said, pouring a drink at the tap. “If you’re ever lonely on a Saturday night, this is where you wanna be. The weekend before Halloween we’re doing a cowboy night.” </p><p>	“And you think I have a cowboy hat lying around?” Though Rio didn’t have a cowboy hat, she did own a pair of camel-toned cowboy boots. She’d gotten them at a flea market in New Mexico.</p><p>	“You’d look good in one.” </p><p>	Rio down the rest of her cider and slid cash over the counter, ready to turn in. </p><p>She lulled home in the truck, pulled into her driveway, and then shivered in her front yard for a few minutes, holding onto her arms. </p><p>The house felt too lonely tonight, and she wasn’t ready to brew in it yet. She had to face herself every day and take on the burden of punishment, and she couldn’t bear to do it tonight. She groaned to herself and avoided her house, embarking on a stroll around Witches’ Road. </p><p>	Rio took inventory of each house she passed. Every house had a unique charm: one donning wooden chimes, one flaunting a gaudy red flag, one housing a giant rocking chair on the porch. By contrast, her porch felt a little barren, save for a couple of pots in the corner. </p><p>She admired Mr. and Mrs. Davis’ front yard, decorated with a sea of wild ironwood bushes, blooming with sprays of white flowers, delineated only by a winding stone path up to the front door. A petite wooden bench poked through the greenery, inviting her. </p><p>Just then, something rustled in the shrubs. Rio ignored it, but then it happened again. </p><p>	A shadow dashed across the path. <em>Hhhhhhhhchh!</em> </p><p>	The unmistakable sound of a cat’s hiss. </p><p>	Rio tracked the black mass, sneaking up the path and to the right, closing in on a thicket of ironwood. “Well, hello there.” A black cat stared back at her, perched on the arm of the wooden bench, shrouded with sprigs. </p><p>	Footsteps thudded against the path and a winded Agatha appeared, with her hands clutching her knees. She straightened up when she saw Rio, smoothing down her black leather coat. </p><p>“Oh,” she said, breathlessly. “You again.” </p><p>	Rio couldn’t hide the relief on her face. “Is he yours?” Agatha always seemed to materialize in moments like this, and it wasn’t helping Rio’s burgeoning fascination with her. </p><p>Every time she laid eyes on Agatha, she fought the fickle nature of attraction. She was beautiful and enchanting, and there was no denying it, but Rio couldn’t let herself pursue her–she hadn’t forgiven herself. Every time she saw Agatha, a deep-set guilt gnawed at her core.</p><p>	“Yes,” Agatha said. “This is Señor Scratchy. He lives in my basement but he’s a slippery bitch.” </p><p>	“Señor Scratchy?” Rio asked. She offered her hand to the cat, and he apprehensively rubbed his head against it. “So, I see you’re a cat of color.” </p><p>	That drew a chuckle from Agatha as she scooped him up and he nuzzled against her chest. </p><p>Rio’s heartbeat throbbed in her ears. “Are you going out?” She waffled on whether to mention Jen’s cowboy event at the bar. </p><p>Agatha met Rio’s gaze. “Maybe.” </p><p>“You look nice. That leather jacket looks great on you,” she confessed, and then immediately regretted being so complimentary. </p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up, curiously. “Oh, I know.” </p><p>“Listen, the Saturday after next, there’s a cowboy-themed event at Jen’s. I think a cowboy hat would suit you.” The words tumbled out of Rio’s mouth, against her will. </p><p>	A rasp escaped Agatha’s mouth, like the low creak of a floorboard. “You won’t catch me dead in a bolo tie,” she jeered. </p><p><em>Ooof</em>. There was no ambiguity in that answer. Rio pivoted. “If you ever need someone to look after Señor Scratchy, I’d be happy to take him in. Or if he ever gets lost, I’d be happy to help you look for him.” </p><p>A crushing ache permeated through her chest and down to her stomach. </p><p>“<em>Why </em>are you being so nice?” A vicious edge protruded from Agatha’s voice. </p><p>Rio pet the top of Señor Scratchy’s head, fingers grazing Agatha’s jacket lapel. “Isn’t it obvious? I’m just trying to get close to your cat.” She buried her feelings. </p><p>The two of them burst into a fit of laughter at the implication. Agatha’s smile was so naked and endearing—and unexpected. </p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed with hotness, conflicting with the cold bleakness pervading from within. </p><p>Agatha composed herself and said good night. </p><p>“See you around,” Rio said, her heart sinking at the realization that Agatha was definitely going out and seeing someone. Her sarcasm cut through Rio’s confident exterior. </p><p>Was that why she rarely gave Rio anything but trouble? </p><p>She scoffed to herself for even believing she had a chance–for even allowing herself to want someone new, let alone Agatha fucking Harkness. </p><p>Rio lay in the dark of her bedroom that night, grasping her bosom as if she were the only person in the world she had left. It was histrionic, and she didn’t care.</p>

<p>It was fully autumn now, fiery piles of leaves accumulated on the sidewalk, and the morning air crisped and cooled. </p><p>Rio spent the last few days concentrating on work, exploring Westview, and meeting new people wherever she went. She wasn’t much of an extrovert, so it became arduous after the fourth new person she’d met. </p><p>But this was the only way to plow forward with her life and avoid thinking about the unavailable woman she’d grown fond of. It was karmic. </p><p>Rio Vidal was always the chased, not the chaser. It’d been that way her whole life, especially at the end of her relationship with Evette. They’d spent years drifting from one another: Evette’s career in finance had consumed her and Rio had grown disillusioned with life and what it meant to love someone for a prolonged time. </p><p>It felt unnatural to her, and the relationship never dominated her mind, body, or soul—but that was what the world had taught her about the lore of love–it was supposed to feel like a sort of sickness. And she’d never been afflicted, not truly. </p><p>Rio cared deeply for Evette and even felt a magnetic attraction to her, but there was always a pretense between them, always a league of distance between them. It was as if they’d glommed onto each other because it was what they were <em>supposed </em>to do when one found someone they could tolerate for more than sex–and even more so, someone their friends and family would condone. </p><p>After an uneventful Wednesday, Rio showered and shimmied into a black jumpsuit with an intricate vine print. She let Lilia and Jen talk her into a date with a cop. Of course, Lilia and Jen were in cahoots. The whole town was connected in one way or another.</p><p>Rio <em>hated </em>cops but they insisted this one was her type—which was—hot. There was no reason not to try dating again. Maybe this date would finally let her entomb the guilt that refused to wither away.</p><p>Rio rushed into Hudson Diner, which sat in the “blue collar” section of town, which was just a few blocks from the town square. </p><p>She was a tad late, but it didn’t persuade her to pick up the pace. She surveyed the diner, peering over people in booths and servers weaving through tables. </p><p>Her eyes fell upon an Chinese woman sitting in a booth, with sharp brown eyes, robust cheekbones, and a neck tattoo. She was tanned, and her black hair jutted out in a grungy wolf cut. That was without a doubt, her date: Alice Wu-Gulliver. </p><p>“Damn,” Rio muttered. “She <em>is </em>hot.”  </p><p>Alice turned around to face her, flashing her a cool smirk. She was out of uniform, instead opting for a graphic white sweatshirt and slouchy maroon cargo pants. “Hey, I’m Alice. You must be Rio.” </p><p>Shaking her hand, Rio scooted into the booth, across from her. Rio ordered a decadent chocolate milkshake she would regret later and a chicken pot pie. Alice ordered a burger with onion rings. </p><p>As she dipped a crispy onion ring into a ramekin of ranch, Alice asked, “So, you’re not looking for a long-term thing? Me neither. Listen, I got divorced six months ago—for real, this time, and I’m ready to hit the hay again.” </p><p>Rio appreciated the candor. Being bashful was for nervous, shaky-handed twenty-somethings. “Like, tonight?” Blood rushed to her thighs, reactively. </p><p>“Yeah. <em>Yeah</em>, like, I <em>need </em>this.” Alice took a hearty bite of her burger. </p><p>The chocolate milkshake was smooth, creamy, and worth the gut punch Rio would confront later. She gulped loudly. “Man, you’re telling me.” </p><p>Rio bulldozed through the chicken pot pie and ate each bite with Tabasco. “How long were you and your ex-wife together?”</p><p>“Three years.” </p><p>Rio cocked her head. </p><p>“I know, I know,” Alice said. “Don’t judge me. I fly close to the sun with all my lovers. I fall hard, flame out, and then I wallow.” </p><p>“Maybe that’s a good thing,” Rio said. “All of my issues are with myself and they probably wouldn’t be problems if I just went to therapy.” </p><p>They didn’t dwell on that for too long. </p><p>“Is that why you moved here? Nobody moves here for the bumping nightlife,” she snorted. </p><p>Rio slurped the dregs of her milkshake. “I don’t know. I needed a fresh start. I was with my girlfriend for a decade, but those last five years, it was like I was numb. I was just sleepwalking through my life. And I couldn’t feel anything until—” she hesitated to talk about what she did to Evette. “—I finally left.”</p><p>They finished up their meals, dabbed their mouths, and split the bill. Rio walked Alice to her squad car, and they quickly came to a mutual understanding. </p><p>Alice took a deep breath and said, “So, I don’t know if I really want to–” </p><p>“I didn’t shave my–oh, thank God.” </p><p>“Do you want to drive around the block?” Alice thumbed her car. </p><p>“Why not?” Rio climbed into the passenger’s seat.</p><p>“Oh, you can’t sit in the front,” Alice said. “Get in the back.”</p><p>Rio halted like a record, already sitting in the passenger’s seat.</p><p>“I’m just kidding.” </p><p>Alice drove lazily with one hand, wrist hanging over the steering wheel. Silence pooled between them for a beat, as they zoomed past a park and a dimly lit strip mall. “So, uh, you live on Witches’ Road, yeah?”</p><p>Rio didn’t know where she was going with this. </p><p>“Lilia says you get along with Agatha Harkness,” she said.</p><p>“Oh, did she?” Irritation flared in Rio’s nostrils.</p><p>“Is she causing any trouble in your neighborhood?”</p><p>Rio said no. She gripped on the armrest. </p><p>“Damn,” Alice said. “Listen, Agatha’s been a thorn in Westview’s side for quite some time now, and she’s got something on that land.”</p><p>“Yeah, I heard. She’s got minerals on her land, or something.”</p><p>“Or <em>something</em>, yeah.” Alice rolled the window down and a gush of frigid air rushed into the car. “Listen, I don’t like to do this, but do you think you could just keep an eye on her?”</p><p>Rio didn’t know how to answer. </p><p>As if she sensed the uncertainty, Alice said, “Look, we don’t know what she’s hiding on that land, but my hunch is that it’s not good for Westview.”</p><p>“What makes you so sure?”</p><p>Alice rounded back towards Hudson’s Diner. “She arrived in Westview and it’s like a black shroud blanketed this town, and it hasn’t lifted.”</p><p>“Okay, so she’s depressed and bitter, is that a crime in this jurisdiction?” </p><p>“Rio, she’s unhinged. People say they’ve seen her digging holes in that grassy field behind her house, burying something. We’ve gotten numerous reports of her burning things back there, too. She’s hiding something back there.” </p><p>The car rattled and buzzed, and the sense of unease percolated between them. Alice clicked her tongue and maintained her unwavering theory. “Who the hell threatens kids with a fucking <em>shotgun</em> for getting too close to their backyard? That’s a crazy thing to do.” </p><p>The hairs on Rio’s neck spiked, but still, her interest bloomed. She’d seen no such things, but she couldn’t help but trust Alice. </p><p>“Look, you don’t have to say anything. Just think about it, okay?”</p><p>Alice came to a stop in the parking lot, and Rio practically tumbled out of the door, slamming it behind her. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	When she arrived home, Rio showered and got ready for bed. It was 10:30 PM. She tucked herself in and lay on her back, examining the ceiling. </p><p>The urge to peek into Agatha’s backyard overtook her; it was all she could think about. She fastened a plush beige robe around her waist and slipped on a pair of sneakers. </p><p>She found herself knocking and clunking through the garage for a ladder in dingy light, and then leaning it against the back of her house, next to the AC unit. This was the shit Joe Goldberg got up to, but Rio blew through her qualms, climbing up the ladder methodically. </p><p>	She peered left and right to make sure nobody else was watching her. The neighborhood was motionless and only barking dogs kept her company. Rio hiked up the steep ceiling and held onto the chimney for stability. </p><p>From there, she could barely see Agatha’s backyard. The tall fixtures of her house obscured much of the view. From what Rio could see, nothing looked particularly sinister. A breeze howled through the tall grasses behind Agatha’s house, and they swayed to the left, dancing. </p><p>But then she saw an outline of something distinctly human in the field. </p><p><em>Shoulders</em>. Flashing in between every gust of wind, veiled by the wildflowers. </p><p>Rio squinted, focusing on the shoulders, her eyes tracing the musculature of the upper arms hidden under a billowing black sleeve. Their arms stuck out, as if welcoming the night breeze.</p><p>The figure wore a pointy black hat, and they were unnaturally tall, towering over the grass. </p><p>Rio sucked in her breath, holding it in, and her heartbeat struck in her ears. Then, she saw the spindly, wooden hands. </p><p>	It was a motherfucking scarecrow with a witch hat. Of course, it was a scarecrow. That’s what the townspeople were seeing in the field. <em>It had to be</em>. </p><p>	“What the hell am I doing?” Rio asked herself. She promptly scaled down the roof and down the ladder, and went to bed. </p>

<p>Rio spent every night on her roof, whether she wanted to or not. The compulsion to scrutinize the dense field beyond Agatha’s house only grew stronger. </p><p>On Thursday night, she stayed up until 11:30 PM to watch from the roof. The lights flickered on in the basement and then off. </p><p>On Friday night, she found a pair of dusty binoculars in a shoebox in her workbench. This was entirely wrong, creepy, and <em>dirty</em>, but Rio couldn’t tear herself away from that roof.</p><p>	She spied through the binoculars, studying the magnified foliage through the lenses. She went to bed disappointed yet again. </p><p>	On Saturday night, she went to bed early. </p><p>On Sunday night, Rio took a preliminary peek while she strolled around the neighborhood and only saw Agatha rolling her recycling bin to the curb. They maintained eye contact for a moment, and then Agatha curtly turned on her heel without acknowledging Rio. </p><p>	Defeated, Rio shuttered all her blinds and locked herself in her bedroom by 10 PM. She felt stupid and pathetic enough—this was it. That was the last time she’d spy on Agatha. </p><p>	She tossed and turned for hours, sweating through the sheets and fisting them in frustration. Rio lay on her side, with her shoulders scrunched up to her ears, reminding herself again to release the tension in her back. </p><p>She closed her eyes for a minute and then wrenched them open. Sleep would not find her, so she flung the sheets off and shimmied into a heavy flannel jacket. </p><p>	It was the dead of night. The barking dogs had gone to rest and the crickets had burrowed away. Not even the wind whistled at this hour. </p><p>Like routine, Rio climbed up the ladder, binoculars slung around her chest, and squatted against the slope of the roof. Through the lenses, she immediately noticed movement in the grasses. A familiar figure in purple stood like stone in place. It was Agatha. </p><p>	She was in her pajamas, which was, unsurprisingly, a matching purple set. She was facing the grass, her hands limp at her sides. Agatha stood and stood, unmoving, like the dead.</p><p>	Rio didn’t know what to make of it, but the reality of spying on Agatha stabbed her chest, remorse quivering with every beat. So, the woman was in her backyard at 2 AM–so, what? </p><p>It was strange, sure, but she had no right to judge Agatha, and neither did all the other townspeople of Westview. Rio let her be and climbed down the ladder. This time, she put the ladder back in the garage, stashing it with a package of oak floorboards. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	For most of the week, Rio returned to her mundane yet busy days: fixing and toggling peoples’ houses, hitting the bar, stopping by the hardware store, and avoiding Alice. She spent the evenings unpacking boxes and breaking them down. By Friday, she’d set up most of her furniture, decor, and house plants. She particularly enjoyed spider plants at the moment and interspersed pots of them throughout the house. </p><p>	That evening, she replaced window siding and trim for Phil and Dottie Jones. They lived in the house to the left of Agatha’s. </p><p>	“What’s it like living next to Agatha Harkness?” Rio asked, coyly.</p><p>	Phil hugged two bags of groceries to his chest. “Honestly, we just stay out of her way. We can live with that crazy front lawn.” </p><p>	“Is she really as scary as people say she is?”</p><p>	He pursed his lips, his mustache becoming more pronounced. “Don’t know. Hope we never have to find out.” </p><p>	With that, Rio lined up a new piece of black wood trim against the beige stucco of the house, butting up against the bottom of the window. </p><p>She fastened each piece of trim around the window and then used a dark caulk to seal the trim against the stucco. </p><p>The Jones had prepaid for this job because they had a seven o’clock dinner reservation and the babysitter was only there for a couple of hours. Rio cleaned up as they peeled out of the neighborhood in their charmingly old wagon. </p><p>	As she loaded up her toolbag, the smell of fire woke her senses. But it didn’t smell sweet and natural like wood, it was acrid and sharp—like plastic or metal. She dropped the caulk gun into her toolbag and stalked the familiar odor, all the way to Agatha’s backyard. Rio scoffed to herself. Of course the universe would keep finding ways to bring her back to Agatha, the supposed stomping ground of all Westview conflict and fuckery.</p><p>Rio saw the source of the fire. </p><p>It was the colossal ancient air conditioning unit, sputtering and sparking. Without hesitation, Rio raced back to the Jones’ house, pulled a fire extinguisher from the wall in their kitchen, and returned to Agatha’s yard.</p><p>	The fire had jumped from the unit to the wires and then licked the brick of Agatha’s house, charring it black. Rio yanked the pin from the extinguisher and sprayed the foam across the top of the unit, sweeping the hose from side to side. </p><p>She also applied a healthy layer to the brick, handily smothering the fire within moments. Then she felt her body slam against the brick, and cold metal jammed under her chin and into her throat. </p><p>Air hissed from her lungs as her back collided against the brick again. The nerves in her elbows vibrated, sending a wave of pain down to her fingers, and the fire extinguisher fell from her grip. </p><p>	Agatha appeared, her wild eyes burning with blue-hot <em>rage</em>.</p><p>	“What the <em>fuck </em>are you doing here?” she barked. She pressed down on Rio’s neck with a baseball bat. The entirety of her body crushed against Rio’s, boiling with fury. </p><p>Rio could feel Agatha’s knees against her own. It was all happening so fast. So many lines crossed, scratched, and obliterated. </p><p>	The pressure in Rio’s neck shot up to her bulging eyeballs. Rio shoved Agatha backwards. “Saving your goddamn house!” </p><p>	“I don’t care,” Agatha snarled. “Don’t ever trespass here again. You’re lucky I didn’t smash your fucking kneecaps this time.” She pointed the bat at her as a warning.</p><p>	Jaw clenched, Rio jerked the bat out of Agatha’s iron grip and lobbed it over to the side. “Not so strong without your bat, are you?” Rio jabbed her finger in Agatha’s face. “You should be thanking me for saving your ass and saving this field of weeds you’re literally willing to shoot someone over.”</p><p>	Agatha took Rio by the throat, with her witchlike hand, and pinned her up against the brick once again. “Still don’t believe the townspeople, do you?” Her knees rammed against Rio’s, holding her in place. </p><p>	“No.”</p><p>	Agatha’s hot breath scorched Rio’s collarbone as she bared her teeth. “Well, you should.” Her hand tightened around Rio’s neck, squeezing with her thumb and index finger.</p><p>	Rio clutched onto Agatha’s wrist, and something in the air shifted between them. This was a sparring match between wills, rage, and desire, but neither of them relented. “Agatha,” Rio said, “I think you <em>are </em>hiding something.”</p><p>There was a glint of despair in Agatha’s eyes, but she masked it instantly with a glare. “And what am I hiding?”</p><p>Rio faced her, locking her gaze upon her, only inches apart. “<em>Yourself</em>.” She glanced at </p><p>Agatha’s lips—and Rio paused for what seemed like the longest second of her life—righteousness, incredulity, and thirst coalescing into a maelstrom. </p><p>Unwrapping Agatha’s hand from her neck, Rio freed herself and growled, “You’re welcome.”</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Alice hip-checked Rio as she fixed her red paisley bandanna over her black denim shirt and jeans in the mirror. “Yee-haw,” she said, admiring herself in the mirror.</p><p>	“You ready to round up the cattle?” Rio asked. She grimaced at the connotation.</p><p>	“Oh, <em>no</em>, hon. Not if you’re my wingman,” Alice said. </p><p>	Rio had run into her at the local cafe a couple of days ago and somehow, they decided to attend Jen’s cowboy event together. They’d scooted around their last conversation: Alice didn’t ask again about spying on Agatha and Rio didn’t mention her last encounter with her. </p><p>Whenever she thought of Agatha’s indignant anger, her fists clenched and she grit her teeth, and then an involuntary rush of heat would snake through her bosom and down her core, and cascade between her legs. </p><p>She’d halt the feeling in its tracks when it came on, resisting as strongly as she could, resisting the urge to untangle that feeling. She <em>couldn’t </em>be feeling <em>that</em> way for Agatha. </p><p>Rio hadn’t seen her since and made certain she wouldn’t have to—taking early morning jobs and jobs across town.</p><p>	“You should take the lasso,” Alice said, handing it to her. </p><p>	Clad in a resonant, seaweed green shirt embroidered with a yellow and pink floral design, Rio knotted the lasso to the belt loop of her dark jeans. “Think I’ll catch someone hot tonight?” She fastened a silver skull bolo tie around her collar and pulled it tight.</p><p>	Alice waffled, tugging on her earlobe and pursing her lips. She fit a mocha brown cowboy hat on Rio. “There, if you don’t catch someone hot tonight, I’ll take you home myself.” </p><p>	“Careful,” Rio said, “I might take you up on that threat.” She stepped into her camel-toned boots, and she was ready. </p><p>	Alice and Rio arrived at Jen’s bar in a giddy frenzy in a squad car with blaring sirens and flashing lights. </p><p>	Jen threw her hands up when she saw the two enter. “Hey! I’m so glad you guys made it! Like a Barbie, she wore a hot pink shirt, pants, and cowboy hat. “See you in hell, you stupid fruits,” she sang. </p><p>	“What?” Rio asked, turning to Alice. The bar was crawling with men watching a football game, straight bachelorettes sipping margaritas, and a smattering of twinks in cowboy hats. </p><p>	“The event is downstairs, Rio,” Alice said, plainly. </p><p>	“Oh.” She followed Alice around the corner, past the cider tap and bar, to a giant, steel walk-in freezer door. </p><p>Alice hauled the door open to reveal a matte black stairwell, winding down in a spiral. When they reached the bottom of the stairs, a childlike grin spread across Rio’s face. </p><p>Boots tapped and stomped the wooden floor as cowboys danced to Orville Peck, while their fringe, chaps, and cowboy hats frolicked and swung with them. </p><p>Tan, brown, and cream triangle streamers and Edison bulbs dangled from the ceiling. A blue and pink neon light of an ox’s skull hung squarely in the center of the longest wall, directly facing Rio. The horns blinked up and down. </p><p>There was a saloon-themed bar to the left, near a pool table. People lounged in velvety, half-circle booths, flirting, drinking, making out, and petting each other. </p><p>	“If you find me like that later,” Alice said, pointing, “leave me there.” </p><p>	Rio noted it. </p><p>	“Hey, <em>you</em>,” a new voice crooned. </p><p>	Rio turned around to a lanky yet elegant young man with a head of curly dark hair and a gaudy black cowboy hat. He wore a tight black leather vest with jeans and flared leather chaps–the outfit unequivocally did not wear him. </p><p>“I’m Billy the Teen. I’m the host of our little shindig here,” he said, reaching for her hand. “And you must be the fresh, new, delicious handywoman in town.” </p><p>	Rio introduced herself. Alice winked at a woman across the bar and promptly slipped into the crowd of bodies. </p><p>	Billy held onto her hand warmly. “We’ve got a whole range of queers for you, Rio. You’re quite the hot commodity right now.” </p><p>	“We’ll see when the novelty wears off,” Rio replied. </p><p>	“Oh, don’t count on it,” he said. “We’ve never had a hot handyperson in Westview and I have a feeling you’re about to get a lot more calls.” His eyeballs looked her up and down. </p><p>	Her nerves vibrated in her body at the thought of taking home one of these attractive cowboys. It’d be fun, certainly, but could she handle it? Would that ever-present guilt break through and drag her back? </p><p>	“Billy, lemme ask you something.” She stood beside him as he wiggled his fingers at a man shuffling on the floor. </p><p>Curiosity got the best of her and the next question she asked brought everything she was suppressing back to the surface. “What do you think of Agatha Harkness?”</p><p>	“I think Westview judges her too harshly. You know, she babysat me and my brother, Tommy, for a couple of months.” He swiped a champagne glass from a server’s tray. “You wouldn’t think it, but she was a really fun babysitter.” </p><p>Rio chuckled at the thought of Agatha making Kraft mac and cheese and watching <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> alongside two little boys. “That’s hard to believe.”</p><p>“I like her,” he said. “She’s such a bitch, but God, does she serve.” </p><p>	“Serve?” Rio asked. She felt old. </p><p>	“You’ve seen her, right? Michelangelo would’ve wept for the Sistine Chapel, Rio.” </p><p>	She dodged answering the statement. “Is she seeing someone?”</p><p>	“Not that I know of.” Billy smirked. “I do hear that she likes a hookup, though. But she only likes to take home out-of-towners and girlies that none of us know.” </p><p>	“Interesting,” Rio remarked.</p><p>	“So, I know you’re not asking about Agatha Harkness for your health,” he said, raising an impeccably threaded eyebrow. “I think you should go for it.” </p><p>	Rio questioned him. “But you just said she’s a bitch.”</p><p>	“Right. That just means she’s a complicated woman. Listen, Westview people might’ve made their mind about her, but they really shouldn’t judge her without knowing who she really is or what she’s been through. She’s got layers, babe,” he said. “Layers someone’s gotta peel back.” </p><p>A burly bouncer tapped him on the shoulder and whispered into his ear. “Ugh, excuse me. I have to go find my brother,” Billy said, disappearing into a hallway at the back corner of the dance floor. </p><p>	Rio stood in the middle of the floor, mired in thought. Billy had surprised her with his nuanced, poignant perspective. She hadn’t expected to soften up again, already open to the thought of Agatha returning to the tapestry of her new life in Westview. </p><p>	She weaved through writhing bodies and boots and ordered a stout at the bar. Then, she hid within the crowd again, sipping her drink and swaying with the cowboys. </p><p>The bassline of a Johnny Cash song twanged and Rio released her heels and body to the music, kicking with rhythm. </p><p>	A blonde woman tipped her hat at Rio and asked to dance. Rio humored her, taking her hand for a two-step as they swung back and forth. </p><p>She was used to being pursued, but not this vigorously. Another woman cut in, linking arms with Rio as they danced to “Ring of Fire.” She smirked at the confidence of these women. They were practically throwing themselves at her. </p><p>Maybe she could meet someone tonight. Alice certainly did. There she was, groping and being groped against the wall behind the pool table. Rio snickered to herself. </p><p>	The music died down for a second, and then Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood’s “Summer Wine” hummed through the speakers. </p><p>Whispers and murmurs traveled through the crowd, and heads turned, like a wave, toward the foot of the stairs. Rio twisted her head back.</p><p>	“No fucking way,” she croaked. </p><p>	Her eyes fell upon a pair of exquisite cow print boots, up to a pair of dusty black wide-leg jeans and a coal-black shirt with white details lining the placket and collar, complete with a tan fringe jacket. A dark brown cowboy hat encased with a silver rune hatband tilted up. </p><p>	Agatha Harkness stood in the doorway, her steely gaze centered thoroughly on Rio, consuming her. </p>

<p>The crowd parted for Agatha as she cut through, extending her hand to Rio. This was a challenge. Rio accepted her hand and Agatha drew her in close. The rest of the cowboys faded into the background. </p><p>	“Hiya, cowboy,” Agatha said, her voice swinging with edge.</p><p>	“That’s vaquero to you,” Rio shot back, letting go of Agatha’s hands.</p><p>	They dragged their feet across each other, circling like vultures, the heels of their boots thumping against the floor. Unsurprisingly, a pair of polished silver spurs adorned Agatha’s cowboy boots, catching a glint of light. </p><p>	“I love Nancy Sinatra,” Agatha said, inching close to Rio, her lips grazing her ear. </p><p>Fire breathed down Rio’s neck, tickling the downy hair, sending shocks down her spine. </p><p>	“So that’s how we’re gonna do this?” Rio asked, lurching back into reality. “We’re just gonna pretend like your house didn’t almost catch fire and you didn’t threaten to break my kneecaps?” </p><p>	Agatha simpered. “Humor me, Rio.” She reached out to Rio once again, offering her hand. Rio accepted it and Agatha squeezed her hand, while the other hand settled on her waist. “Dance with me,” she said in a low, breathless voice.</p><p>	Rio clung to Agatha’s shoulder and led the dance with a step forward. “When I invited you to this, I was under the impression you didn’t want to come.” </p><p>	“I said I wouldn’t wear a bolo tie.” Agatha leaned her head back, thrusting her dimpled chin out. It was one of those characteristics that Rio remembered on people, like a fingerprint.</p><p>Rio absorbed the sight as if Agatha could vanish at any second. She savored the intimate details of her freckled neck, like stars scattered in the sky. It was hard to focus on the issue at hand.</p><p>	Her curiosity preceded her. “Where were you going that night?” Rio leaned in, watching every pulse of Agatha’s forehead vein, every crinkle of her nose, and every twinkle in her eye. </p><p>	“Rusty Hill. They’ve got live music,” Agatha said, nakedly. It was an honest, straight answer.</p><p>“Were you going with friends?” </p><p>	Agatha blinked and looked smugly at Rio. “Why do you care?”</p><p>	Rio lied and said she didn’t care, suddenly on uneven footing, grasping at her dignity. The murky waters of her intentions and emotions had distilled into crystal clear waters, choppy with turmoil. </p><p>Agatha had jolted her from her seemingly permanent dormant state. </p><p>At this moment, while she danced with Agatha, their hands intertwined, and Rio knew that she wanted her. Carnally. In ways Rio had only fantasized about in hazy vignettes. </p><p>She wanted Agatha’s body pressed up against hers–again—but this time transforming anger into passion. Rio wanted to relish the friction of their bare skin grazing one another, heated and heavy.</p><p>	But logic and rationale wouldn’t let her forget how Agatha had slammed her up against the brick wall, her eyes ablaze, as if she was possessed. Rio asked, “Why were you so angry at me?”</p><p>	“You shouldn’t have been trespassing, that’s all,” Agatha said. She stepped forward, leaving Rio no choice but to step back in rhythm. “I would’ve seen the fire, eventually. Probably.” </p><p>	It was clear she wouldn’t extract any truthful answer to that question, so Rio freed herself from expectation and predictability. “I’m surprised you didn’t just get the gun, Agatha,” Rio asserted. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say you went a little easy on me. Why go for the bat?” </p><p>	A flash of mischief blinged in Agatha’s eyes. “What can I say? I take pity on the bad boys. Bad on the outside, but just a softie on the inside. The bat seemed more your speed.” </p><p>	“You know,” Rio said, “Even if all those rumors about you are true, like you say, I don’t care. I want to hear your side of the story.”</p><p>	Agatha’s suave visage dropped. “What did you mean when you said I was hiding?”</p><p>	Rio took the opportunity to lead the dance again, stepping forward and closing the space between them. “You hide within this town’s tapestry of you. I think you do it because it’s easier than facing whatever it is you’re harboring inside. You live up to the rumors and expectations about you to keep people out.”</p><p>	“Well, it’s working, isn’t it?” Agatha asked. Rio could see the cracks in the foundation forming.</p><p>	Rio shook her head definitively, with the weight of an anchor. “It’s not working on me.”</p><p>	Agatha tossed her hair over her shoulder. </p><p>	They’d come to a truce, smiling at one another for a fleeting moment. The burning desire had returned in full-force, blooming in Rio’s core. </p><p>She wanted to savor every moment she could have with Agatha. She was the type of woman who could slip through Rio’s fingers, like a phantom.</p><p>	“So, should I break something else in my house? Is that how I beg for your forgiveness?” Agatha asked, splintering through their shared moment. </p><p>	“Well, you definitely should replace that fire pit you call an AC,” Rio said. Was Agatha flirting with her? Was this mutual? Was Rio ready for the consequences of this heavy-handed banter?</p><p>	Still, a question cooked in her brain–where was Agatha going that night? Rio couldn’t let herself fall into a chasm for a woman who wasn’t available. She could <em>not </em>repeat her past with Evette. </p><p>She asked, “Are you seeing someone?” Rio’s tongue traced the edge of her teeth, and she pressed further. “Exclusively?” </p><p>	“Depends on how you define it.” Agatha fought for control, swinging Rio in a spin. </p><p>	Rio complied and spun back into Agatha’s hold, but maintained her composure. “Why so coy?”</p><p>	 Agatha only smirked and pulled Rio close as she led the dance once again. “Are you used to getting your way? You ask questions and you press and you expect answers, right?”</p><p>	Her eyes flitted on Rio’s expressions, honing in on her soul, like a game of cat-and-mouse.</p><p>	“Answer the question,” Rio said. “Agatha,” she said, inching close to her ear and inhaling the scent of her shiny, dark hair. It was the scent of lavender, so subtle, that only someone this close could’ve perceived it. The scent roused her confidence. “Are you seeing anyone? Dating? Sleeping with anyone?” </p><p>	The candor of her words fetched a hyperbolic expression of genuine shock from Agatha. But she ignored Rio’s question. “I like this look on you. It accentuates your–” </p><p>	God, she was infuriating. “Stop deflecting,” Rio snapped. It was a simple “yes” or “no” question. It shouldn’t have been this complicated, but Agatha never seemed to say what she meant. </p><p>Rio didn’t know her well enough to decode anything. But she knew one thing for tonight: she couldn’t let herself go after another taken woman.</p><p>	Agatha was quiet. She held eye contact with Rio, waiting for her to break first. Neither of them did. They lingered on each other, their hands flexed, their hips swaying to the cadence of Nancy Sinatra.</p><p>“Listen,” Agatha said, cradling Rio’s chin with her thumb and index finger. “I…” Her eyes flicked down to her lips. “...have to go.” She released Rio and slinked away into the crowd, into the back hallway. </p><p>Rio’s boots stayed planted on the floor, no matter how hard she tried to yank them up. She wanted to stalk Agatha back there, but she couldn’t compel herself. All logic and reason screamed at her not to. This was a <em>terrible</em> idea. Was this how repentance looked? A bewitching smoke show in fringe? </p><p>Her heart raced, each beat reverberating in her ears and through her sternum, like a hammer to nail. Her cheeks flushed hotly and sweat broke out upon her back. Her composure caved in, and her desires were laid bare. </p><p>Rio could no longer withstand the heat–she had to find relief. </p><p>She marched into the hallway, coming upon two doors. One to the storage room and one to the dressing room. She turned the handle to the dressing room.</p><p>The dressing room housed a dimly lit closet with racks of costumes to the left and a grand black vanity. Agatha stood in front of the large mirror covering the wall, her hat and fringe jacket tossed to the far corner of the vanity counter, meeting Rio’s eyes through her reflection. </p><p>Rio swallowed and locked the door with a heavy click. She removed her hat deliberately and slowly, hanging it on the door handle. For what seemed like the longest few seconds, she faced the door, zeroing in on the orange paint peeking through the chipped black paint, her heartbeat in her throat. </p><p>She turned back to face Agatha’s reflection. </p><p>Only the sound of their shallow breaths enveloped the room. Rio edged closer and closer, like a huntress, until she stopped inches behind Agatha. She breathed her in, and her scent absorbed into her body, trickling from her chest into the tips of her fingers. </p><p>Rio ran her fingers through Agatha’s wavy hair, stroking the ends and bringing them to her nose. She closed her eyes, basking in this sliver of time in the universe—that belonged only to them—aimless and untethered in space. </p><p>Still, neither of them uttered a word. </p><p>Rio locked eyes with Agatha in the mirror and swept her hair to one side, her fingers barely grazing the nape of Agatha’s neck. </p><p>Rio stayed deathly still, assimilating every freckle, wrinkle, texture, and scar. Together, they formed a map of Agatha’s mysterious past. </p><p>Brushed her lips against the pale skin of Agatha’s neck, Rio promised intimacy silently, and didn’t satisfy her with a kiss. No, she wanted to enjoy this moment. </p><p>She could feel the electricity between them and the dominance surging through her veins, lording it over Agatha. She couldn’t resist power like this.</p><p>Rio wrapped her left hand around Agatha’s throat, lifting her chin so she could see herself in the mirror. Her other arm wrapped around Agatha’s waist and her hand drifted from her torso down to the belt loop of her jeans, her thumb hanging onto it. Knuckles white, Agatha clutched the elegant lip of the counter to steady herself, as if she might disintegrate into dust. </p><p>With the sleight of one hand, Rio unbuttoned Agatha’s jeans, sustaining an unbroken gaze in her reflection. Agatha dared Rio with her eyes, her gaze scorching, her lips curling. </p><p>Without pretense, Rio slipped her hand into her jeans, and under the waistband of her underwear, her fingers touching the softest part of Agatha Harkness. </p><p>She trembled under Rio’s fingers, wet and breathless. Rio observed her through their reflection, their bodies leaning into one another, in a silent pact of bestowing and receiving desire. This was <em>intoxicating</em>.</p><p>An otherworldly power overwhelmed Rio as she caressed and picked up the pace. Agatha’s chest heaved. </p><p>Then Rio entered her, feeling her warmth around her fingers. Agatha gasped, biting the bottom of her supple lip. Rio wanted her, all of her. She tightened her grip on Agatha’s throat and clenched her jaw, her own lungs void of air. </p><p>Was this what Rio had wanted all along? She glared at herself in the mirror and the</p><p>reality of being locked in a dressing room with Agatha came crashing down, like a hurricane making landfall. <em>What the hell was happening? </em></p><p>	Was Agatha taken? Was she playing her? Had Rio made the same mistake of herself? Had she written herself in stone as a <em>cheater</em>? </p><p>Agatha rolled her head back onto Rio’s shoulder and she closed her desperate eyes, readying herself.</p><p><em> </em>Before Agatha could take the remainder of her power, Rio pulled her hand away, removing herself. She couldn’t bear the weight of her guilt, razing her newfound forgiveness for herself to smithereens. </p><p>She took her hat from the door handle, unlocked it, and wrenched it open before rushing out. </p>

<p>Rio blacked out on the way home and slammed the front door behind her, buckling against it and sliding down to her knees. </p><p>	“Holy shit, holy shit, <em>holy shit</em>.” She whispered in panicked tongues to herself. “What did I do? What am I doing?” </p><p>	Rio beelined to her dining room and rummaged through the stately liquor cabinet, searching for the mezcal she’d gotten shipped from Zacatecas. It’d been sitting, unopened, the amber bottle gathering dust for about a year. </p><p>She hadn’t opened it when she left Evette, so she decided she would open it when she truly needed it. Her hour of need had arrived. </p><p>	She poured herself a heavy-handed glass and threw it back. The liquor sizzled in her throat and she winced. Then she had another splash. A series of errors unfolded that night, and around 1 AM, Rio stumbled to her bedroom, face planting into bed.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	The doorbell clanged like it was going out of style, over and over, vibrating through Rio’s teeth. Her brain bounced around her skull as the bell rang through her skin. She’d been snoring on her belly, with her head twisted at a horror movie angle. </p><p>She belched herself into consciousness and flipped onto her back, forcing herself onto her elbows. Her neck was as stiff as plywood, twinging with pain as she stood up. Her joints ached with every step and the crackling sound they made ruefully reminded her that she was simply not sturdy enough to guzzle mezcal like she had last night. </p><p> <em>Ding-dong. Ding-dong. Dingdongdingdongdingdongdingdong.</em></p><p>	Rio tore the door open, powered only by fury now.</p><p>“<em>What</em> do you want?!” </p><p>Concentrated sunlight beamed into the house and into her eyes, to which she shielded her eyes as if she were a vampire. “Oh, Jesus Christ.” </p><p>	Through the cracks between her fingers, Rio could make out three shadowy figures. The one in the middle had a familiar, textured haircut. The one on the left had a short haircut, close to the curve of their skull. The one on the right had curly hair.</p><p>	“Here, put these on.”</p><p>	Someone handed Rio a pair of black sunglasses. “Alice?” Rio took in Alice’s serious, mascara-smeared eyes. Then she saw Jen and Lilia. “Wow, you brought the whole squad.”</p><p>	“It wasn’t my idea,” Jen replied. She looked flawless, as per usual. Her eyeliner was satisfyingly sharp and her skin was dewy and springy, like she’d just left the spa. </p><p>	Lilia flashed a look of offense. “Alice told us you left the club in a rush and she couldn’t find you or reach your phone.” </p><p>	“We were worried,” Alice said. “And you looked kinda upset.” </p><p>	Rio fell back onto her couch and the three of them filed into her house and plopped down around her. “Well, I’m fine.” </p><p>	Alice and Jen sat in loveseats facing the couch and Lilia sat next to Rio.</p><p>	“You’re clearly hungover.” Alice crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes. “Did you drive home drunk? I don’t wanna be a cop about this but I’m literally a cop so if you–”</p><p>	“Jeez, I didn’t drive home drunk, okay?” Rio said. “This…happened after I got home.” The amber mezcal bottle on the coffee table sold her out. An empty glass sat next to it. </p><p>	“Okay, so what happened?” Jen asked. “You and Alice seemed like you were having a great time. I know Alice was having the tongue of her life.”</p><p>	Alice smacked Jen on the bicep with a limp hand. </p><p>	Rio didn’t want to say. She remembered everything. Every sensation, scent, texture, sound, and sight of <em>her</em>. God, was it delicious. But nauseating guilt and dread eclipsed the fleeting pleasure of the memory. She burped again, and her throat burned with acid.</p><p>	“Wait a second, we aren’t talking about the weirdest thing that happened last night,” Jen contended.</p><p>	Lilia and Alice blinked. Rio’s stomach churned loudly.</p><p>	“Agatha came to the club, guys,” Jen said. “Say what you want about her but she commits to themes. If she weren’t such a witch, I might’ve asked where she got that fringe jacket.” </p><p>	“She was there?” Alice asked.</p><p>	“It’s not totally out of the ordinary,” Lilia said. “She’s been known to party a little.” </p><p>	“Okay, wait,” Jen said, fingers tapping her forehead. “Rio, what happened? Why were you so upset?”</p><p>	“I did something.” Rio cringed and sunk into the cushions of the couch. She hugged a fuzzy, apple green throw pillow to her chest, wishing she could shrink into an ant and burrow herself away. </p><p>	Lilia deciphered the look in her eyes instantly and sighed with her whole body. “Oh, my God. You didn’t. Did you?”</p><p>	“I did,” Rio said, nodding into her hand.</p><p> Alice and Jen turned their heads to Rio.</p><p>	They turned their heads back to Lilia.</p><p>“You did <em>not</em>.” Lilia sprung to her feet, her hands firm on her hips. “Oh, Rio. What did I tell you?”
	Rio didn’t protest. </p><p>“Does one of you want to chime in and tell me what exactly Rio did?” Alice quipped. </p><p>Lilia ignored her and continued her rant. “She’s not your friend, Rio. I mean, you’ve talked to her and been in her house—and you even said so yourself—she’s rude, entitled, unhinged, kinda violent.” </p><p>“I know,” Rio whined. “We got into it the other day. She threatened me with a bat.”</p><p>“Wait, is this about Agatha?” Jen asked, her eyes widening. </p><p>Alice pursed her lips and her expression hardened. “Is that why you left last night? Did you guys get into a fight?”</p><p>“I thought Lilia said you guys got along,” Jen muttered.</p><p>“Oh, I think they’re <em>getting along</em>, alright,” Lilia said, her mouth curling to one side of her face. </p><p>Jen and Alice both froze and shot a look at each other.</p><p> 	Rio confessed. “There was some yearning. And heavy-petting. On the outside, mostly.”</p><p>	Lilia shook her head, methodically, and her frown carved itself deeper into her jaw. The disappointment and disbelief hung in the air like a noxious fume. </p><p>	“You’re sleeping with Agatha Harkness?!” Alice asked. </p><p>	“Not really,” Rio said. “I don’t think last night can happen again.” </p><p>	“So, she threatened you with a bat and…” Jen trailed off, gesturing with her hand, squinting her eyes with confusion. “You decided to pet her kitty?”</p><p>	“Oh, Jen, please,” Lilia said, waving her hand with disgust. </p><p>	“This could be a good thing,” Alice said, her fingers linking. “You’re probably the closest person to Agatha right now. Did you think about my proposal for you?”</p><p>	“Wait, so she’s not seeing anyone?” Rio asked, eagerly sitting up. </p><p>“If she were, the whole town would know,” Alice said. “You could be our confidant, Rio.”</p><p>A pang of sharp pain stabbed Rio in the stomach. “I’m not going to spy on her, Alice.” The relief of finding out she hadn’t gone after a taken woman was short-lived and shallow. </p><p>	Lilia sat next to Rio once again and clamped a hand around her shoulder. “This could be good for Westview, Rio. And you really don’t know her.”</p><p>	“And you guys do?” She couldn’t do it. She couldn’t play both sides of the fence. But there <em>was</em> a speck of doubt, humming beneath the surface, always. </p><p>	“Okay, look, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,” Alice said, relenting. “But, please, Rio–if you find out what she’s hiding, think about us. Think about Westview.” </p><p>	Before Rio could say a word or protest, Jen stood up. “I’m starving. Let’s make some pancakes.”</p><p> Rio hated that her friends were right. She didn’t know Agatha Harkness, not truly. </p><p>The woman was an enigma, and Rio wanted nothing more than to decrypt her masked expressions and her vague remarks. But what Lilia said crawled under her skin, prickling at that doubt. </p><p>There was no good reason for Agatha to become so enraged that evening, unless she was hiding something on that land. Agatha was the epitome of smoke and mirrors, and Rio couldn’t let that distract her, no matter how good it felt. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Monday rolled around, Rio’s hangover finally subsided. She hibernated for the weekend, rescheduling a few jobs for the week, and imbibing a steady stream of Gatorade and water. </p><p>She wasn’t ready to see Agatha again, not after <em> everything </em> that had happened the last time. Rio couldn’t trust herself around Agatha when she looked at her, though she held all the power last time, and it revived her soul. </p><p>Agatha didn’t seem like the type to relinquish herself to another person; she seemed like the woman who held the reins, controlling them to her desires. Had she <em> let </em>Rio hold that power over her? </p><p>It was a scary feeling, not knowing if what she was doing was <em> right </em>or not–and knowing that her newfound friends were vehemently opposed to anything to do with Agatha didn’t help. </p><p>It wasn’t a question of whether she desired her, that was a certainty. It was what came after that. Rio hadn’t thought that far ahead. She lived in the present, and she hadn’t expected to cross paths with someone like Agatha. </p><p>She’d arrived during a fall breeze, and a cyclone carried her away. </p><p>Rio got ready, wearing a cream sweatshirt with a pair of denim overalls, and headed out for her first job of the day. She went through the garage, and straight into her truck. Her first stop was the hardware store. </p><p>When she arrived, she found Lilia at the front desk, where she alternated between the crosswords in the newspaper and greeting customers.</p><p>Lilia slurped her coffee and groaned at it. “Blech, I never learn. Diner coffee is never good.” She scribbled on her newspaper, scratching the page to get the ink in her pen to flow. She didn’t look up when Rio came in, the bell sounding from the ceiling speaker. “How’s your head?”</p><p>“I’m hangover-free, Lilia,” Rio said, on the tips of her feet from the drywall aisle. She grabbed two panels of sheetrock and a bag of joint compound mix. “Got any tips for the Leungs? I’m putting in an archway for them today.” </p><p>Lilia chewed on her lower lip and took her glasses off. She pointed with her pen. “The Leungs love their security system. It’s wired through every single doorway in their house.”</p><p>“Oh, God,” Rio said. </p><p>“I’d buy some cable ties and a staple gun if you don’t have one. The guy who set up their security system was an animal. I’ll check out what you have and hold it up here,” she said, waving Rio over. “Cable ties are in aisle six and the staple guns are in aisle nine.” </p><p>Rio placed her merch on the counter and wandered back to the aisles. She scanned the variety of cable ties, twist ties, twine, and gear ties. </p><p>Eventually, she settled on a pack of dainty, white cable ties. White would blend best with most walls. </p><p>The door rang again, and Lilia greeted the customer enthusiastically. It was uncharacteristic of Lilia to be so loud and breathy, but Rio paid no mind. </p><p>She moved onto the staple guns, which were situated with the nail guns. The store only carried two nondescript brands of staple guns: one pneumatic and one manual. Rio chose the stainless steel manual staple gun and swiped a box of staples. </p><p>When she emerged from the aisle, she instantly recognized the lean figure chatting with Lilia at the register. </p><p>Rio pivoted on her heel and ducked at the speed of light, back into the safety of the aisle. What the hell was Agatha doing here? She certainly didn’t seem like the type of homeowner who willingly went to the hardware store. Rio’s ears perked up as she strained to eavesdrop. </p><p>“...Doing your own projects, huh? Good for you,” Lilia gushed. “...spackle in aisle four behind you.” </p><p>“You guys sell paint here?” Agatha asked. </p><p>“We sell a small selection of basic colors…” Lilia said, babbling.</p><p>Agatha drummed her long, witchy fingers against the sheetrock on the counter. “So, I guess you and Rio know each other, right?” </p><p>Rio straightened up, pushing her shoulder blades back, as if it could help her listen harder. </p><p>“Sure, she comes in here for her jobs. As handypeople do.” </p><p>Sighing with relief, Rio relaxed her shoulders. This was a testament of her friendship with Lilia in real-time. </p><p>“If you see her, will you just tell her I’m looking for her?” Agatha pressed.</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>“None of your business, Calderu,” Agatha said, melodically. “I’m gonna go look at the paint.” She abruptly left the front desk and marched toward the back of the store, miraculously missing Rio on her way. </p><p>Rio poked her head out of the aisle and caught Lilia’s attention, her eyes following her every move. They had a telepathic understanding. She scurried to the front desk and grabbed the sheetrock panels, clamping them under her armpit. </p><p>She whispered to Lilia, “Just charge these to my account?” </p><p>Lilia nodded and winked. </p><p>With her leftover appendages, Rio gathered the rest of her stuff and skittered out of the store. </p><p>Agatha had been looking for her. Did she want to talk about what had happened? Was this about something different?</p><p>Rio’s heart shot through her ribs, ricocheting around with a mess of fear, anxiety, nerves, and excitement. Her mind raced, like film slides clicking through a projector, the images nonsensical and luminous. She couldn’t make sense of the images, but they all revolved around Agatha. </p><p>Sucking in a breath, Rio shoved the feeling down deep into the recesses of her body and focused on getting to the Leungs’ house. She was always good at getting back to dry land, back in her body.</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>Rio patched and finished the drywall at the Leung residence, and accepted a generous tip on her way out of the neighborhood gates. </p><p>She stuffed the cash into the front pocket of her overalls and twisted her spine, trying to stretch the ache out of her back. Work like this had torn her body apart, year by year, tendon by tendon, but she staved it off as much as she could, unlike her dad. </p><p>The elder Vidal numbed his joints with beer and didn’t believe in stretching, so the cords in his neck accrued knots. Eventually, he relied on heavy bouts of ibuprofen, destroying the lining of his stomach in the process.</p><p>On her lunch break, Rio stopped by the town square to pick up some groceries at the market. She’d planned on cooking French onion soup this week, but she forgot the Gruyère and she wanted a few Vidalia onions. </p><p>Begone pop stars hummed on the speakers and seniors hunched over the produce. Rio snuck between an older man and shrunken woman, near the potatoes, onions, and garlic. The three of them rummaged through the produce in silence, looking past bruises and squeezing for unwanted mushiness. </p><p>As soon as Rio found a suitable onion, she placed it into her mesh produce bag. She peered around for the dairy section–and the air in her lungs suddenly evaporated. </p><p>There <em> she </em>was again.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Rio said, under her breath. </p><p>Agatha stood in the cheese section, with a bag slung over her shoulder, studying the Edam and Camembert like a culinary student. She whipped around suddenly, her tricky eyes fixed on Rio, catching her in a trap. </p><p>“Hey, <em> you </em>,” Agatha called.</p><p>Rio stammered, which was completely out of character. “Hey.” She held her basket up. “I’m here on my lunch, so I’m just in and out.” </p><p>“Relax, I just wanted to ask about your upcoming schedule. And about your experience with remodeling bathrooms.” </p><p>Rio clenched her stomach, her guard zipped up to her neck. “You could’ve sent a ticket in for that.”</p><p>“It’s a big job,” Agatha said. “I didn’t know if that was part of your services.” She ambled closer, floating over to the tomatoes. </p><p>“Well, what’d you have in mind?” </p><p>Agatha thought for a moment, pushing her lips out. “I want to rip out the tile, replace the sink, replace the toilet, and maybe do some painting.”</p><p>Rio kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, but it never did. “I mean, I typically don’t do contractor stuff like that but–.” </p><p>“Can you do it in two weeks?”” </p><p>Before Rio could answer, Agatha completed her sentence. “I know–’put in a ticket.’ Yeah, yeah. I might, I might not. Good thing you live on my street.” She turned, signalling the abrupt end of the conversation, going back to the cheeses. She placed a jar of apricot jam in her basket and considered the truffle cheese. </p><p>Disbelief pervaded through Rio’s chest, constricting her airway. Was that <em> really </em> the whole conversation? <em> That’s </em>what Agatha wanted to talk about? Was all of this in her head? </p><p>Rio hesitated between the onions and mustered a broken set of words from her mouth. “Are we–you’re not–can we–?” </p><p>She’d never been tongue-tied. She was the type to speak deliberately, selecting her words carefully, and executing smoothly. </p><p>But as soon as Agatha looked at her, Rio’s brain seized. Nobody had ever tripped her up like this. She prided herself on being the cool, calm, and collected person in any situation. This clearly wasn’t the case now.</p><p>“Are you always this squirrelly?” Agatha teased. She enjoyed having the upper-hand, too much. </p><p>Rio strutted over to her, attempting to regain her cool demeanor. “So, we’re just going to pretend like Saturday night didn’t happen?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “We don’t have to make it a whole thing.”</p><p>Rio expected her heart to sink, but instead it blackened with heat. “No, we don’t have to.”</p><p>“But I did enjoy myself.”</p><p>Hubris bolted through Rio’s rib cage, and she said, “I know.” </p><p>She couldn’t let Agatha have the last word. She could see the cogs turning in Agatha’s pretty head, and it only padded her ego. </p><p>As much as the woman sent mixed signals, these were flashing, blaring, and red. </p><p>Rio continued, “Do you want to enjoy yourself again?”</p><p>Agatha sputtered, her mouth cracked open but nothing came out, foraging for something witty to sling back. “What are you suggesting?” </p><p>She hadn’t expected Rio to play ball.</p><p>“You tell me,” Rio said, winking at Agatha. She pivoted on her heel, pulling the pin to a grenade and leaving Agatha with the fallout. </p><p>She <em> had </em>to have the last word, even if it meant steeping in uncertainty. </p><p>At least now, she’d know if the chase was mutual. </p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>Rio finished her jobs that day and returned home around 7 PM, her joints aching, and her overalls smudged with dusty white spackle and such. </p><p>The high of having the last word had dwindled, but only marginally. She hung her keys up on the hooks in the hallway closet and threw her coat on her couch. Then, she threw herself on the couch, too, exhausted. Starving, but too tired to do anything about it. </p><p>She shifted on her back, unable to get comfortable. The muscles in her lower back tightened like cables, rigid and unyielding. Rio groaned and poked her fingers into her muscles, hoping to relieve the ache. </p><p>It worked for a moment, but what she really needed was to unweave her muscles and unroll her body, like a long piece of dough. </p><p>She flopped onto the floor, moved the coffee table aside and pulled her right knee to her chest. Staring at the ceiling, Rio was starkly reminded that it was popcorn ceiling, its ugly texture casting odd pimply shadows that made her skin crawl. She scowled.</p><p>She thought of each painstaking step she’d have to take to get rid of that godforsaken, asbestos-filled trend: she’d have to wet the ceiling and scrape all the texture off, which would probably take days by herself. </p><p>Her neck spasmed just thinking about it. Alas, it could wait another day. She yawned and suddenly sleep snuck over her, like a weighted blanket. </p><p>The doorbell rang once and a raucous snore escaped Rio’s open mouth, which aroused her from slumber. </p><p>The door rang again. She rolled her eyes, still laying on the rug under the coffee table. “<em> Ugh </em>. Go away,” she said to herself. </p><p>Then, a series of flat, matter-of-fact knocks. Rio checked her watch. It was 10 PM. There was only one person who could and would disrespect her time like this. She sat up, and to her surprise, the door creaked open. </p><p>Agatha stood in the doorway. “Hello?” she called. She moseyed inside and gave Rio a look of confusion, cocking her head to the side. “What are you doing?”</p><p>Rio stayed on the floor, her limbs stiff. “Okay, better question. Do you always invite yourself into your neighbors’ houses?” </p><p>“You really should lock your doors, Rio,” she said. “Again, what are you doing?”</p><p>“I had a long day and my back hurts,” Rio said, finally standing up. “It’s late. Why are you here?” It then occurred to her—Agatha could be here to <em> enjoy herself </em>. </p><p>Was this how it would happen? Her heartbeat sped, lurching into her throat. She hadn’t imagined that <em> this </em>was how their escapades continued, dressed in overalls. </p><p>Agatha turned towards her, facing her straight on. She started with an open pair of hands. Just as quickly as Rio allowed herself to indulge in fantasy, Agatha quashed it.</p><p>“I thought about your proposition, and I just don’t hook up twice. I can’t.” </p><p>Rio stood as still as a rock, attempting to cover her unabashed disappointment. </p><p>“Can I ask why?”</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha said.</p><p>“What?” Rio eyes darted left and right.  </p><p>“Come here,” Agatha repeated, lifting one arm, beckoning for Rio. </p><p>Rio floated over under her command, her bloodstream rushing with tumult and bewilderment. Her stomach gurgled. </p><p>“Turn around.”</p><p>Rio turned around.</p><p>“Fold your arms against your chest.”</p><p> Rio obeyed, bringing her elbows in and then folding her forearms across her chest, as if she could be laid into a casket at any moment. </p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio, her chest pressed up against her back, breathing on her neck. “I’m not looking for anything and I don’t want this to be weird, especially if you’re going to be my handywoman–”</p><p>“How could this possibly be weird?” Rio deadpanned, turning back to face Agatha, inches from her lips. She couldn’t help but glance at them. </p><p>“Hush,” Agatha hissed, “you’ll feel better.” Her arms constricted around Rio, and she tugged upward, sharply. Rio’s spine cracked and the ache in her back suddenly dulled. Agatha released her.</p><p>Rio turned around to face her again. She was so taken by the maneuver and the lack of pain in her back that she forgot to feel the sting of rejection. “Oookay,” she started, “you’re a <em> witch </em>.”</p><p>Agatha flashed a close-lipped smile. “They do say that about me.” </p><p>“So, is that what you came over to talk about? To tell me you don’t hook up twice?” Rio asked, finding her balance. She was more disappointed than she should’ve been, but she wasn’t looking for anything beyond sex—and she could achieve that elsewhere. </p><p>“Maybe.” Agatha paused. “No.” </p><p>Rio ventured past Agatha and into the kitchen, peeking into the portal that was her refrigerator. “It’s never an easy answer with you,” she said. She dug out a carton of eggs, bacon, and lettuce and put a pan on the stove. </p><p>“I actually came to officially book you for my house,” Agatha said. “I was serious when I said I wanted the bathroom done in two weeks.” </p><p>“At this hour?” </p><p>“A witch never sleeps, Rio,” she said, like an adage. She eyed the bacon sizzling in the pan. </p><p>“Agatha, I don’t usually do jobs like this–”</p><p>“Before you say anything, I have a whole Pinterest board with some ideas and I want you to take a look–and then decide.” </p><p>Rio hadn’t pegged Agatha as the type of woman who liked Pinterest, but alas–she was a fancy white lady and this was part of their culture.</p><p>Had anyone else asked to renovate their bathroom, Rio would’ve pointed them towards WestPages. </p><p>But this was Agatha, and she couldn’t pass up the chance to learn more about her, so she accepted the job with a heavy-chested sigh before she even saw what it entailed. She had to know what the rest of Westview was seeing when they saw Agatha.</p><p>Rio would be in her house, again. She’d learn about Agatha’s taste in bathroom tile and paint colors, and that was intriguing. What if she had bad taste? Would that air of mystery suddenly vanish?</p><p>Rio cracked an egg into the pan. “Fine, send it to me,” she said, knowing her body would feel like shredded wheat when she started the project. “You want a BLT?”</p><p>“Absolutely not. I’m gonna go sit on that cushion graveyard you call a couch,” Agatha</p><p>said, pulling out her phone, her voice trailing away. “Oh, God, I’m siiiiiiinking.” </p><p>Rio caught her reflection in the single panel of steel on her fridge, and she tucked her hair behind her ears, brushing her flyways into order. She reminded herself: it’s just Pinterest. It was late, and she was bone-tired, but this could be how she cracked Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>Rio chomped through her sandwich in two bites, while Agatha chattered on about her hatred of white subway tiles. She insisted on the return of maximalism, and said beige belonged in certain wardrobes in certain circumstances, not on walls and on furniture. </p><p>Then, she walked back on maximalism and decided on an Art Deco renaissance. </p><p>After dinner, Rio put her dish in the sink and returned to the living room. Rio sat next to Agatha, one couch cushion apart. </p><p>Agatha scrolled through her Pinterest board, pointing to black slate tiles, floral wallpapers, gold fixtures, green pendant lights, and French country cabinets. She had <em> great </em>, if not, eclectic taste. It was unexpected. </p><p>Rio had expected to see more mid-century touches—cleaner, simpler lines. But this was gorgeous, striking, and bewitching. </p><p>This was what it was like to catch a glimpse past Agatha’s hard shell exterior. It happened so rarely, and Rio felt lucky that she’d been chosen.</p><p>Agatha’s current bathroom was perhaps incongruent with who she was as a person: it was washed in a warm yellow paint, granite countertop, white enamel sink, and oak floors. It was respectable, but no personality emanated from it.</p><p>An hour had whizzed by. Rio had an early job tomorrow, and she knew she’d wrest herself from bed in the morning with brittle, stiff shoulders. She didn’t care. </p><p>“I guess I’m all yours for two weeks,” Rio said. She felt around in her breast pocket for a pen and marked two weeks on the calendar hanging in the kitchen. </p><p>So, why are you in such a rush to get this done?” Rio asked. </p><p>Agatha sucked in her bottom lip. “No reason. I just can’t stand that yellow paint anymore.”</p><p>“I don’t believe you,” Rio said, bluntly. “You got friends coming in town you wanna impress or something?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said. “I don’t really have friends anymore.”</p><p>“So, you’re doing it for you, then?” </p><p>“Sure,” Agatha said, slouching against the back of the couch. She clawed and clutched at the cushion, one hand on each side of her thighs. “Where’d you get this couch? So I can make sure never to shop there.”</p><p>Rio lobbed a throw pillow at her, reactively. “I bought this off Wayfair, okay? My ex took the supportive couch.” That wasn’t a lie, but it wasn’t exactly the truth, either. Evette deserved the good, firm, designer couch. </p><p>“Where’d you move from?” Agatha asked, one eyebrow rising. </p><p>Rio told her about the town just outside Chicago where she’d lived for most of her life, while conveniently skirting around any mention of Evette. </p><p>“Is that why you moved?” Agatha turned her body towards Rio, resting her elbow on the edge of the drooping couch. “To get away from your ex?”</p><p>“That’s part of it.” Her walls reared, hoisting high around her past. Rio’s brown eyes darkened, obscuring the truth. </p><p>“Why here? Why Westview?” A sparkle flickered in Agatha’s eyes, all the way down to her quizzical smile. </p><p>Rio pushed back. “How about I answer that question after you answer a couple of mine?”</p><p>Agatha held up her index finger. “One question.” </p><p>“How did you become Señor Scratchy’s keeper?” It was a simple, unexpected question that would reveal some of Agatha’s character. </p><p>Agatha squinted, as if in disbelief. “I found him when he was a kitten. Must’ve been about eleven years ago. It was the anniversary of N—”</p><p>“That part’s not relevant.” She hesitated and continued. “He was living in my gutters. I heard meowing one night, and at first I thought he was in the attic. But then, I climbed up to the roof–and it was the middle of the night. And there he was, buried under a year’s worth of muck and leaves.”</p><p>Rio imagined rainwater gushing down the sides of Agatha’s house. A <em> year’s </em>worth of debris in the gutters in a climate like this must’ve been insane. </p><p>“So, I scooped him up, and he scratched me right across the nose, and I fell off the ladder.”</p><p>A gasp left Rio’s body. </p><p>Agatha rolled up her sleeve, revealing a long, gnarly scar running from her elbow up to her forearm. “I probably should’ve gone to the hospital for this, but I wasn’t in a good place, so I taped the cut together.”</p><p>Rio studied the scar, noting that it’d healed flat in some places and bumpy in others. It was reddish, with bursts of miniscule veins here and there, apparent against Agatha’s pale skin. </p><p>“I take it that’s why he’s named Señor Scratchy?” Rio asked. </p><p>“Precisely,” Agatha said, winking. “Your turn. Why Westview?” </p><p>“The answer really isn’t that interesting,” Rio said, biting her tongue. “I wanted to be alone, I guess. I wanted to be unknown, even to myself.” </p><p>“Why would you want to be unknown?” </p><p>The quiet between them surged. </p><p>“You’re fascinating,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio smiled at her, with the tenderness of a summer breeze. She couldn’t help it.</p>

<p>By Wednesday, autumn had become tinged with a chilly wind, a harbinger of a dry winter to come. Alice had caught her at the bar, and Rio reluctantly recounted her night with Agatha over hot cocoa. “It’s not like you’re a rat,” Alice said, unconvincingly.</p><p>Rio found herself in the passengers’ seat of Alice’s police car, yet again, warming her hands over the raucous AC vents. She told Alice that she’d be working in Agatha’s house for a couple of weeks.</p><p>	“This is good, Rio,” Alice said. “You’ll be in her house a lot. Could be the only time you just take a gander around her house, see if you can find anything else out.”</p><p>	“Okay, seriously, there hasn’t been anything suspicious about her, really,” Rio insisted. “She’s just theatrical.”</p><p>	Alice ignored her and continued questioning. “You haven’t been able to get a closer look at that field behind her house?”</p><p> 	Rio said no.</p><p>	“Seriously? You put out a fire back there, and you didn’t get a look?”</p><p>	“No! Sue me for focusing on one thing at a time while there’s a fire and a very, very angry woman threatening me.” Rio spilled a splash of scorching cocoa on her hand. </p><p>	“Wait,” Rio said. “I have seen her in her backyard, in her pajamas, late at night.”</p><p>	Alice tipped her head closer, her eyes waiting for more.</p><p>	“I’ve seen her in that field a few times. She just stands there.”</p><p>	“Hmmmm,” Alice hummed. “That is strange.” </p><p>	Rio sank into the seat, and it creaked, her stomach uneasy and swirling. What she’d said out loud was real, now—to Alice and Westview. Perception was reality in this town. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>Rio spent the evening with Jen, dropping in at various boutiques and quaint strip malls. Billy was hosting trivia night at the bar, and Jen rarely had an evening off. </p><p>	Rio liked to start Christmas shopping early; that was the tradition with Evette, even though it drove her nuts. Thanksgiving was only a little over a week away.</p><p>Evette had relished the chaos of a Black Friday sale, and Rio actively avoided it. It was pointless and grotesque to Rio, but here she was, shopping far too early. </p><p>	At a local home goods store, she browsed through the candles and kitchenware. She’d be buying for a few people in Westview, at most. It was a strange change, but truthfully, she had grown exhausted with the ever-expanding line of people she had to buy presents for. Maybe that was why she moved. </p><p>There’d be no obligations this year, even from afar. Westview was an isolated town. The internet here was spotty, and Rio liked it that way; it made it harder to live her life through the whirlpool of screens. </p><p>	“What do you think of these?” Jen asked, wagging an assortment of dish towels with bright red designs on them. </p><p>	“They look a little murder-y,” Rio volunteered. </p><p>	Jen nodded in agreement and set the towels down. “I should stick to the citrus and fish ones.”</p><p>“Do you like these?” Rio asked, brandishing a four-pack of beautiful, end grain coasters. “You think these would make a good gift?” She pictured them in Agatha’s living room, on her Danish coffee table. Was it too much wood? Was it midcentury-leaning? Did she hate coasters and that was why Rio didn’t see any? </p><p>	“Yeah, they’re cute,” Jen said, absentmindedly. Then, she swirled her head around, pursing her lips. “A gift for Agatha? Come on, Rio.”</p><p>	Rio didn’t deny it. “Look, we’re not doing anything. She’s just my neighbor. I’m doing some work for her house soon—and Christmas is coming up in a month. I thought it’d be nice.” </p><p>	Jen didn’t have to say anything else to draw more out of Rio.</p><p>	“Okay,” Rio said. “We’re really not doing anything. That last time, that was a one-time thing, apparently. I may have propositioned her, and she shot me down, and that’s that.” </p><p>	“Well,” Jen said, “I’m sorry.” She patted Rio’s shoulder the way an absentee father would, a little too hard and familiar. “Honestly, it’s probably the universe’s way of telling you to stop fucking around.” </p><p>	Rio placed the coasters back in their rightful slot on the item display. The pendulum between pursuing her lust and residing in safe rationale constantly swung, and Rio wasn’t sure how much longer she could bear it. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	On Thursday morning, Rio bundled herself in a pair of heavy-duty black coveralls and a coffee-colored shearling coat. She tied her hair up in a bun, but two tresses of hair still fell in her eyes. It drove her nuts, but she lived. </p><p>She arrived at Agatha’s front door at 8 AM sharp. Her breath appeared in front of her in the crisp air. </p><p>Today was the first day of this breakneck-pace project, and she’d be taking measurements of the bathroom, removing the vanity cabinet, mirror, and sink. </p><p>	Agatha opened the door, looking past Rio, gesturing for her to come in. She had her AirPods in, discussing something about budgetary concerns at her company. Her hair looked styled, in neat waves, with one side pinned behind her ear. </p><p>	She looked pretty in a cordial, candid sort of way. Rio couldn’t peel her eyes from Agatha, and couldn’t believe how attractive she looked, doing such mundane, everyday things.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat in an attempt to concentrate on the job and not the way Agatha looked, even though she’d already imagined how she’d look just after her work day had ended: tousled hair, half-unbuttoned shirt, an irresistible lip bite. </p><p>She followed Agatha past the dining room and into the hallway. </p><p>Agatha pointed to the bathroom and then left Rio to her work. </p><p>	Lobbing her coat on the couch, Rio got to removing the vanity cabinet. She dropped her tool bag on the floor and started with the shut-off valves under the sink. The pipes and valve were corroded with a green and white crust, but not so badly that they’d need to be replaced right away. </p><p>But Rio decided she’d replace them anyway–it’d be a cleaner job. She dug around in her bag for her trusty pocket knife, which had a beautiful curved blade and dark wood handle, carved by hand. </p><p>It had been her father’s, passed down from his father, and so on. Nobody in the Vidal family seemed to know its true origins, and nobody knew why the blade never seemed to dull. She’d come into possession of the knife after he passed, in a wooden box with his belongings.</p><p>	Had he been alive, he would’ve flipped if he saw how she used the knife. She took it with her for most jobs, cutting through packaging, caulk, grout, wood, and other materials. It was like a piece of him she kept at her side, at all times. </p><p>Rio used it to slice through the caulk sealing the vanity to the wall. She closed the knife and clipped it to her leg pocket. </p><p>	She unscrewed the mirror from the wall and set it in the hallway. Within two hours, she’d dismantled the vanity and removed the sink, and the hallway bathroom was ready for its makeover. </p><p>	Agatha wandered down the stairs, with a particularly content bounce in her step. She stopped in front of the newly placed mirror in the hallway, admiring herself. She wore a pair of flared blue windowpane pants and a royal blue shirt tucked into it. “Hey,” she said, poking her head into the bathroom, hanging onto the door frame. “You work fast.”</p><p>	Rio looked up at her. “Yeah, I’ve done a few of these.”</p><p>	“So, you wanna hit the store? Go buy a vanity and pick out the floor tiles?”</p><p>	“Right now? I thought you were working,” Rio said, sheepishly. She stood up, meeting Agatha’s eyes. </p><p>	Agatha snickered. “Please, they’re lucky I show up day-to-day.” She grabbed Rio’s arm. “Come on. Let’s take your truck.” </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Seventies ballads played softly through the speakers as Rio drove. She and Agatha made conversation, exchanging pleasantries about the weather and the plans for the bathroom. 		After a lull, Agatha asked, “So, how’d you learn how to do all this stuff?”</p><p>	Rio clutched the wheel and made a right turn. “My dad.” She smiled when she thought of him. “He was a handyman, too, and I used to tag along on his jobs and I’d unscrew panels, drill holes, spackle, clean up, you know. We spent a lot of time in his workshop, too. I went to community college for some foundational skills and the business side, but my dad had a whole lifetime of experience that I wouldn’t have learned anywhere else.”</p><p>	“Do you still talk to him?”</p><p>	“He passed away a few years ago,” Rio said. “He and I were always closer than my mother and I.” </p><p>	“I can relate,” Agatha said. “My mother and I were always at odds.”</p><p>	“I’m sure for good reason,” Rio said, reassuring her. She didn’t let on that she’d read those terrible news articles about her mother.</p><p>	“I didn’t know she’d passed away until I saw the obituaries nearly three months after the fact,” Agatha uttered. </p><p>	A profound sense of sorrow propagating in Rio’s core, like thorny vines, lashing around her muscles. She felt sorry for Agatha, but not pity. Rio could feel her pain, bleeding into the space between them, suffocating them. </p><p>It was cut short when they arrived at the specialty hardware store. </p><p>	Once inside, Agatha’s mood shifted once again, cloaking herself in that smug visage that kept others at bay. Rio went with it.</p><p>	They explored each aisle, interchanging thoughts about the wood patterns of the vanity cabinets and the material of the sinks. Eventually, Agatha chose an elaborately carved mushroom-colored vanity with a dark ceramic sink. It looked nearly identical to the French country vanity Agatha had pinned on her Pinterest board. Rio ordered it and coordinated the loading of it into her truck while Agatha browsed the bathroom tiles. </p><p>	When Rio returned to her, Agatha pointed to black hexagonal tiles. “These?”</p><p>	“Too busy.” </p><p>	Agatha held up square tiles. </p><p>	“Nah.”</p><p>	“What about these?” She stroked a glossy herringbone-pattern tile. “Never mind, I hate these.” </p><p>	Rio scanned the tiles, her hand outreached. “What about…” </p><p>	Her hand and Agatha’s met on the same tile. An electric spark jolted through Rio’s spine. Agatha didn’t pull her hand away. They’d chosen a gorgeous black mosaic tile with a white seven-pointed star. </p><p>	Rio wanted nothing more than to take Agatha’s hand and tug her close against her body, meeting her body’s every desire and need.</p><p>	“These are cement tiles, so they’re definitely pricier,” Rio said, stirring from the moment. </p><p>	Agatha waved her hand, grazing her hair. “Price is but a number. Let’s get them.”</p><p>	Rio wasn’t surprised, but she was yet again intrigued. Agatha must’ve been high up at her company, because those handmade cement tiles were prohibitively expensive for most of the folks in Westview. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	The next two days, Rio sweated over the floor, prying up the tiles in the bathroom, her arms and legs weak by the time she’d finished. Every time she clutched something, the tendons and ligaments and muscles in her palms and forearms cramped. She kneeled on the floor, staying there as long as she could. </p><p>Agatha bumped around the kitchen, whipping dinner together. Rio packed up her gear and got to the front door. </p><p>“I bought too much bacon,” Agatha said. “Stay for dinner.” </p><p>It was less of a question and more of a directive. Rio paused and turned. “Sure.” </p><p>They sat in the dining room, adjacent to one another. Agatha had made BLTs, except</p><p>that they were exceptional. Rio raved at the first bite.</p><p>Agatha had made a chipotle mayo from scratch and cooked the bacon to crispy perfection. The bread was perfectly buttered and grilled, too. On the side, she served sweet potato fries.</p><p>	It wasn’t surprising that Agatha could make a mean sandwich. She seemed like the type of person who only ate the most delicious versions of every food. </p><p>	“Jeez, I forgot what it was like to eat dinner with someone else at this table,” Agatha conceded. </p><p>	“God, me too,” Rio said. “This is nice, not to go home to an empty house to eat dinner by myself.” When she said that out loud, she realized how much single-hood had seeped into the fabric of her daily life, and her being. </p><p>She prided herself on independence, and she was happy–but she didn’t want to live a life of solitude forever. </p><p>	“I’m not dying to jump into anything serious right now,” Rio continued. “Not after the last decade with my ex.” </p><p>	“Right.” Agatha asked, fiddling with a sweet potato fry. “What was that like for you?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. It was an innocent question, but her lower lip twitched at the reasoning behind Agatha asking.</p><p>“My relationship? It was fine until it wasn’t,” Rio said, side-stepping the hairy underbelly</p><p>of that colossal question. She switched the spotlight onto Agatha, instead. “What about you? What was your last relationship like?”</p><p>Agatha hemmed and grunted. “Mine? My last relationship?”</p><p>Rio captured a tremble in Agatha’s hand and a flare of—<em>unease</em>, behind those calm eyes. </p><p>“<em>Pfffft</em>, that was so long ago, I don’t even remember it,” Agatha blathered. “I mean, </p><p>please, I’ve had hot flashes that have lasted longer than any of my relationships.” </p><p>	“Come on,” Rio said, egging her on. “You can’t tell me you don’t remember any of your exes.”</p><p>	“Look, the truth is,” Agatha began, “I don’t do relationships.”</p><p>	Rio taunted her with a weighty smirk. “Oh, really? Like you don’t do hookups twice?”</p><p>	“Yeah, like that.” She wiped her hands with a napkin and crossed her arms tautly. “I don’t see why it’s a bad thing.”</p><p>	Rio cleaned her hands in her napkin. “I guess it’s not necessarily bad.” She wrung her fingers, and her palm spasmed violently, forcing her hand into a fist. “<em>Ah, </em>fuck. My hand is cramping–”</p><p>	Agatha snapped her fingers and summoned Rio’s hand, taking it and pressing her thumbs firmly into her palms, immediately releasing the tension. Rio’s shoulders relaxed into Agatha’s strong, nimble hands. </p><p>	“Does that feel good?” Agatha asked, with an expected answer. </p><p>	 Rio stuttered, butterflies fluttering in her stomach. “Yeah, it does.” Why did she turn into jello anytime Agatha touched her? </p><p>Her spine dissolved, and her resolve dissipated like mist when this particular woman touched her skin. Rio flexed her core, stifling the arousal like a bug under her foot. </p><p>	Agatha massaged her hand, and eventually moved up Rio’s forearm. A tingle climbed up Rio’s legs as she stayed in the moment with Agatha, simply looking at her.</p><p>She paid no mind to Rio, absentmindedly handling her as she recounted her short-lived relationships. “I’ve had flings, romps, encounters, strong, unbroken eye contact in dimly lit bars, all of it. I’ve lived, ‘kay? But none of them go anywhere after that initial…time. Whether it’s chemistry, looks, vibes, fatal character flaws, terrible taste in shoes, they’re annoying–it always ends. And it’s always messy.”</p><p>	Rio implored her to continue with an inquisitive look, her eyebrows creeping up. Agatha took her other hand and kneaded the stiff muscles in her hand. </p><p>	“They all come to the same conclusion, which I think is true and I don’t care: it’s me that they don’t like. And have I been known to use people for my own pleasure? Yeah,” Agatha huffed. “But they knew that, coming into my house–and coming—never mind. The point is, relationships just don’t work with me. And I’m happy with myself.” </p><p>	“Are you?” </p><p>	“Yes.”</p><p>	“Then why are you squeezing my hand so hard?” Rio asked, her hand limp in Agatha’s boa constrictor grip. Rio flashed a grin at her, shattering Agatha’s illusion of coolness and being unbothered. Then she saw it in Agatha’s eyes. Bolts of white-hot lightning. She was holding herself back. </p><p>Could Rio be mistaken? Was there indeed a layer of mutual attraction boiling under the surface? </p><p>	“Oh.” Agatha loosened her grip. </p><p>	Rio rested her hand in Agatha’s open palm for a second. “For the record, I don’t think it’s you that’s the problem.” </p>

<p>For the next few days, Agatha had Rio over for dinner several times. Each time, they made light conversation, chatting about Señor Scratchy’s new diet and Rio’s odd propensity for finding lost items. That, however, didn’t stop Rio from dreaming of Agatha, shamelessly. </p><p>	At night, she found herself lying in bed with her arms above her head, gazing up at the ceiling. Her hands clenched at the memory of Agatha caressing them. She brushed her lips with her fingers, reliving what Agatha’s neck had felt like against them. </p><p>Then she imagined what her mouth would taste like: perhaps like a rainy day in the spring, or an autumn breeze. She savored the romanticism of her daydreams before drifting to heavier, edgier thoughts. </p><p>	The recurring dream that Rio clung to was the one where she sat upon a vast knoll on a picnic blanket, grass tickling in between her fingers. </p><p>She’d watch the sun emerge from a pillowy sheet of lilac clouds, showering her tan skin with hazy, placid light. And then Agatha would appear, twirling a purple azalea between her long fingers. </p><p>She’d smile at Rio and come closer, practically climbing over her, and her eyes would lock on hers. The hairs on Rio’s arm stood up, as Agatha straddled her, one leg on each side of her hips. </p><p>	They’d remain frozen, posed in time like a Polaroid, their eyes locked on each other, like keys to their souls. And then Agatha would take Rio’s face in her hand, caressing her cheek. She’d whisper in a low, gravelly voice, the warmth tickling Rio’s ear.</p><p>	The grating sound of her blaring phone alarm always woke her up when she got to that part. Rio stumbled from her bed in a daze, donning a toothy grin. </p><p>	Breaking with the rest of the week, she spent the day sealing and polishing the cement tiles, until they were lustrous like liquid.</p><p>She locked herself in her garage, working on the tiles in a makeshift workshop bench composed of two tables of different heights. She hated unsealed tiles; their porous faces made her fingertips feel dry, the microscopic particles of cement dust stuck in the grooves. But still, she pushed through. </p><p>This kind of rote work was a type of therapy for her, completely encompassing her senses and thoughts, so she wouldn’t have to think about <em>her</em> more. </p><p>Rio wouldn’t admit it out loud, but she felt off-balance. She’d grown accustomed to her routine with Agatha over the week, and it felt odd being at home again. </p><p>She thought about what Agatha was doing, imagining her at her computer with a pair of thick black-rimmed glasses resting on the bridge of her nose. She’d chew her bottom lip when she got an email for a new ticket at work, and then she’d roll her eyes, abandon the laptop, and then drop in on the progress of the bathroom. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>Around 7 PM, Rio finally finished working on the cement tiles, signifying the end of the day when she shook out her hair and took her corduroy baseball cap off. She put it back on, backwards, and tucked her hair behind her ears. Trudging to the kitchen, Rio yawned and cracked her neck from side to side. </p><p>She opened the fridge and groaned, knowing she’d never been much of a cook, and dinner would be an odd mishmash of food. Rio was a utilitarian, and food was no different.</p><p>The muscles in her forearms fluttered and loosened, like overstretched rubber bands, weakened. Her father had taught her some stretches, in which she flexed her hands outward for a few seconds and then curved both hands back in towards her wrists. </p><p>In the fridge, there was half a bag of carrots, a handful of cilantro, some leftover pork shoulder, and a container of diced white onion in the fridge. Rio frowned, but then blew her hair out of her face and resigned herself to some low effort tacos. </p><p>As she took everything out of the fridge, the doorbell rang. </p><p>“Come in!” Rio called over her shoulder.</p><p>In walked Agatha, and it didn’t surprise Rio this time. </p><p>“I’m trying a new pot roast recipe. Come over.”</p><p>Rio brushed off her coveralls, which were sullied with cement dust, old paint, and pen. “Right now?”</p><p>“Yeah, right now,” Agatha said, impatiently. She still had an apron over her work clothes, a crisp white shirt and a pair of plaid slacks. Snapping her fingers, she sucked in her cheeks and puckered her lips. “Let’s go, while it’s hot.”</p><p>Surrendering with her hands up, Rio let the fridge door swing shut and followed Agatha out of the house and up the road to her house, as if she were under a spell. </p><p>On the walk up, Rio muttered, “Wow, dinner at your house again? You must be fond of me.”</p><p>“I find you the least annoying in this town,” Agatha said, tipping her haughty nose up. “And also you’re giving me a hell of a deal on this work, so this really is just an obligation on my part to appear–”</p><p>“You really could’ve left it at ‘yeah, sure.’” </p><p>Agatha turned around and pointed to her head. “I like the hat.” She winked at her and then entered her house. </p><p>Rio immediately began analyzing that wink, dissecting it under her mind’s microscope like a pathologist. She wasn’t sure if it was meant as a message, or if Agatha was just messing with her—as usual. And the compliment about her cap—was she joking? </p><p>She felt like a clumsy, bumbling teenager, trying to decrypt every look and word from Agatha. But within seconds, she stopped herself, shooting herself down with a mental tranquilizer dart. </p><p>Rio reasoned with herself: this was just the horns emerging. She hadn’t felt <em>this</em> attracted </p><p>to someone in years, so of course it was exhilarating. Of course, it made her pulse race between her legs, tightening like a rope. But it would pass, eventually. </p><p>	Agatha served two plates with aromatic pot roast, and they sat down at the dining room table.</p><p>	Rio washed her hands and then began unbuttoning her coveralls, twisting her body out of them.</p><p>	Agatha’s eyes widened and her lips parted. </p><p>	“W-what are you doing?” she asked. </p><p>Rio felt her eyes lasering in on her, and she suddenly felt exposed. She tied the arms of her coveralls around her waist, now just wearing a white tank top. “I didn’t want to get your stuff dirty,” she said, innocently. </p><p>	“Oh,” Agatha said, “thank you.” She fumbled with her soup spoon as she sat down across from Rio. She regathered herself in an instant, but Rio had already gleaned the true meaning of that look. </p><p>	At dinner, they chatted about their days. Both were mundane: Rio sealed tiles. Agatha regaled a story about corporate tomfoolery. She hadn’t revealed much about her job thus far, so Rio sank into her pot roast, listening with her shoulders up to her ears. </p><p>	“First, they tell me they need me to get a new contract signed with the integration platform by the end of tomorrow,” Agatha said, “so I pull all the coordinators and analysts off the migration project to test the platform, right?”</p><p>	Rio nodded. “This is delicious, by the way.” </p><p>	Agatha thanked her curtly. “And then I get a message from the head of IT and the VP. ‘We’re not going through with this contract. We’ve decided not to integrate vendor invoicing into the ERP.’” </p><p>	Rio vaguely followed the plot of her day, but the acronyms and details flew over her head. It was hot when Agatha blew off steam about her job; there was something inexplicably attractive about the way she clenched her jaw. </p><p>Rio tasted each bite of her dinner, the savory, cozy flavors of meat, carrots, and potatoes enveloping her mouth and tongue.</p><p>	Agatha went on without taking a breath.</p><p>	“These fuckers send us on a wild goose chase every time they hear ‘AI’ and ‘low-code’ and I have to manage the budget and timeline, which gets pushed every time they get this whim, and the project just grows and mutates and–” </p><p>	She realized that her hands had contorted into freaky angles, and she sucked in a breath… “I like my job,” Agatha said, “but I hate the bullshit.”</p><p>Rio tittered. “You know, for someone with such a big reputation in Westview, you’re awfully normal.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes patiently traced their way up to Rio’s. “You say that, but you don’t really know me or my secrets, or my past.”</p><p>Biting her bottom lip, Rio replied, “So, tell me about you. I want to know you, Agatha.”</p><p>“Why?” Her face sharpened and the air thickened.</p><p>“Do I need to have a reason?”</p><p>“Look, if I know anything about people, it’s that you can’t trust them. They’re never who you think they’re going to be,” Agatha stressed. </p><p>“You can’t trust me?” Rio asked. She wasn’t hurt, but she also hadn’t expected Agatha’s sudden coldness. </p><p>She was truly unpredictable; it was like boarding a ship riding on brooding, uneven waves in the middle of a gray storm, without a compass. “Come on, you don’t trust me, but somehow, we’re friends?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head at Rio. “We’re not.” </p><p>An unwieldy silence descended upon the table. Rio held Agatha’s gaze, challenging her to look away, to fracture the ice pane that had frozen between them. </p><p>She gathered the dishes, and placed them in the sink, soaking them with dish soap. The dish soap smelled familiar, an enticing lemon and mint, reminding Rio of her laundry detergent, fragrant and not too overpowering. Agatha followed her into the kitchen, her arms crossed.</p><p>Rio turned around from the sink. “You’re right. I don't really know you, under all this hot, pale, menacing thing you have going on,” she said, finally breaking the tension.</p><p>An unwilling smirk pulled at Agatha’s lips. “So, who put you up to this? Lilia? Alice?”</p><p>“Nobody.” Rio gripped onto her hand, her fingers imprinting on Agatha’s protruding tendons. Her hands were blistering, as if they’d been roasting in a fire. </p><p>Agatha looked down at Rio’s hand and caught her gaze once again.</p><p>Rio let go of Agatha’s hand, but she so desperately wanted to hold on. Her perseverance didn’t waver, though, and she didn’t let Agatha put up her wall of sarcasm and humor. </p><p>“You say we’re not friends,” Rio said, “so, what are we, Agatha?”</p><p>	Agatha took a breath, her lips curling, as if she were about to say something. Instead, her hand reached out, her fingers stroking Rio’s jaw and cheek. The look in her eyes was sharp and harsh, like a fortress had frozen around her heart. </p><p>	“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio whispered, not quite a protest. She wasn’t strong enough to resist her, not at this moment, not if she went further. </p><p>She wanted to crumple under Agatha’s touch, and to give into the connective rhizomes sprouting between them. It’d be so easy to get what she wanted now, to burn up the desire that had been building in her core.</p><p>But something in the recesses of Rio’s reptilian brain flagged her skepticism, her <em>doubt</em>. </p><p>It was as if Agatha was trying to distract her, to run away from answering the question. She could see Agatha’s exoskeleton hardening, as she performed a sleight-of-hand, conveniently sweeping away the truth at hand. </p><p>	Still, Agatha didn’t say anything. She pulled Rio close, their foreheads touching. Her thumb brushed against Rio’s lips. She was right there, ready to receive Rio. </p><p>	Wrapping her hand around Agatha’s wrist, Rio swallowed hard, inhaling the lavender scent of her hair. Her knees wanted to buckle at the thought of finally consummating with this woman. Rio wanted nothing more than this—but her misgiving would not relent—this wasn’t the right time, or <em>reason</em>. </p><p>	“Agatha,” Rio said, regaining her footing, and meeting Agatha’s blue eyes. “Did you really think that was going to work?” She grabbed Agatha by the hips, a little too confidently, and pushed her against the counter next to the stove top. </p><p>	“It was worth a shot,” Agatha said, barely audible, her tongue poking in her cheek, a smarmy admission of defeat. She wriggled from Rio’s grasp, sidestepping. “But for the record, why does it matter?”</p><p>	“It doesn’t matter to you?” Rio asked.</p><p>	Agatha shook her head and shrugged. “No.” She was as serious as death.</p><p>	Rio didn’t reply; she was void of any meaningful words. She wanted to poke and prod and ask why. Why didn’t it matter to her? </p><p> <em>No</em>. </p><p>	The word reverberated in her head, sending catastrophic seismic waves from her chest to her psyche. The way she said it was so nonchalant and blasé—as if to say this was who Agatha Harkness really was: cold, unpredictable, distant, and <em>cruel</em>. </p><p>Rio’s heartbeat crawled to the pace of a snail, her heart plummeting to the depths of her leaden stomach. </p><p>Had she been imagining the chemistry between them? Had Agatha been toying with her, this entire time? She <em>had</em> to have felt what Rio felt. </p><p>Rio refused to believe she’d imagined it in her head; that would be too far from her perception of reality. </p><p>	Her disappointment was palpable, physiologically, but she’d always been adept at hiding her true feelings underneath her cool exterior. </p><p>She wouldn’t let Agatha parse through her shell, not after she’d so callously played her. This had become a twisted game of wills, and Rio would play, even if her desire betrayed her.</p>

<p>The next day, Rio returned to Agatha’s house, buttoned up in a pair of black coveralls, her hair neatly tied back in a bun. She fastened a lavender bandana around her neck.</p><p>The wind howled through the creaky windows, like an omen.</p><p>Agatha said good morning, as if nothing had happened, and then disappeared upstairs, clacking away at her keyboard. </p><p>After she’d had the night to process their conversation, Rio’s disappointment morphed into something hotter, something molten. She scoffed to herself as she unloaded the polished cement tiles from carefully packed boxes, cursing in Spanglish under her breath. </p><p>Against all odds, she’d absorbed her mother’s way of expressing her anger, down to the way she peppered “puñeta” through every jagged sentence that left her mouth. </p><p>When Rio was a child, her mother would curse over the stove as she painstakingly slow-cooked chicken and then scrubbed the dishes with a violent gusto. The common thread was the woman never stopped to process her feelings, whether they were good or bad. She was the engine that propelled the household forward, as her father returned home late and often left early in the morning. </p><p>That thread followed Rio, as she avoided any and all thoughts bordering on feeling. She was good at compartmentalizing, until now. </p><p>Her thoughts kept circling back to the gall of Agatha. How brazen she was when she said what happened between them didn’t matter. Who the hell was she to deny that spark that kept Rio up at night? Was it denial on Agatha’s part, or was Rio the one in denial?</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	Rio worked quietly for hours, doing a dry run of the cement tiles, arranging them on the ground and then finally began installing them. Her simmering anger killed her appetite, and she skipped lunch.</p><p>	Around 2 PM, a silhouette loomed over the tiles and Rio looked up.</p><p>Agatha leaned in the doorway. “It looks great,” she said, her shadow floating over Rio. She sipped a fizzy orange mocktail through a glass straw. Her cheeks sunk in, and her cheekbones demanding attention. “Do you want one?”</p><p>	“Sure, why not?” Rio focused on her work, placing spacers down between the tiles as she pressed them into place, her ire turning into a flat calm. </p><p>	Agatha disappeared for a minute and then reappeared with an identical tall glass filled with the same fizzy drink. “Cheers,” she said.</p><p>	Rio grit her teeth, appalled at the ovaries on this woman, but she maintained her expressionless face. Her very expressive mouth always gave a little too much away, at times. </p><p>This was the game then. It didn’t have to be hard; she could be civil.</p><p>Clinking her glass against Agatha’s, she took a sip. “That’s pretty good,” she remarked. Rio asked what the drink was called. </p><p>“I don’t know, I just threw it together. Call it ‘Witches’ Brew.’” Agatha replied, “You know, I </p><p>was a bartender for a hot second when I moved away for college. Didn’t last long.” </p><p>	Rio set her glass down and continued arranging the tiles, kneeling. She looked up at Agatha. A lightbulb went off in her head. “You were born here, then?” </p><p>Agatha hugged her arms to her chest, nursing her drink. “Yep. I’ve been the witch of </p><p>Westview for a lot longer than people know.”</p><p>	Rio pressed further, now moving on to another section of the floor. “Do you have family here?” </p><p>	To her surprise, Agatha didn’t clam up right away; she took the bait. These were the questions she usually shunned and screened. “No, no. The people who were my family are gone.” She had two maternal aunts, but she’d only met them once when she was a child. Agatha said her mother kept her isolated. </p><p>	Rio paid her condolences, not knowing what she could say. Curiously, she asked, “Were you ever close with your mother?” </p><p>	“Never,” Agatha said, curtly. She switched course, deflecting. “My mother couldn’t wait for me to turn eighteen, so she could wash her hands of me. So, I went off to college, tried to pave my own way. But I couldn’t afford it—which was why I was bartending. But I’m not good at doing what I’m told.”</p><p>“That’s unsurprising,” Rio quipped. “When did you move back to Westview?”</p><p>Agatha sighed with pause, thinking of her answer. “I didn’t come back to Westview for a long time. Not until my mother died.”</p><p>“Was that why you came back?” Rio asked. “Because she died?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha’s watery eyes went soft, and then she cleared her throat. “I loved her, against all odds. But she couldn’t stand me.” It was an unusually naked display of emotion and humanity for her. </p><p>Rio could see the vestigial limbs of Agatha’s grief, her desolation, treading water for stable ground. Still, she asked why her mother hated her.</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth, her pulse in her jawline. </p><p>Coming to her feet, Rio leaned into her space, listening intently. “How could your mother hate you?” she asked.   </p><p>	Finally, Agatha took a shaky breath and said, “She said I was the spitting image of my father.” She finished her drink, and continued, “He left just before I was born. I was ‘born evil,’ she’d said.” </p><p>	Rio didn’t know what to say, except to offer perfunctory, empty words of comfort. She backed off and didn’t probe any further. “I’m sorry,” she managed.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have–” Agatha didn’t finish her sentence, waving her hand.</p><p>Instinctually, Rio wanted to meet Agatha’s phantoms and learn the epochs of her history, absorbing her pain and her past. She wanted to reach out for Agatha’s hand, intertwining her hardworking fingers with her nimble, lithe fingers. But Rio’s rationale told her to retreat, reminding her that this was just part of the Agatha show. Part of the act. </p><p>The woman was an enigma, obscured by showmanship, and no matter how delectable she was, Rio resisted the urge to reach out for her. </p><p>And the universe seemingly agreed.</p><p>“I have a call,” Agatha muttered, jabbing her thumb over her shoulder.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	That night, Rio returned to her old, immoral habits. She ate a light dinner consisting of a Mediterranean salad and pasta leftovers, showered, and read the latest issue of <em>n+1 </em>in bed, and fell asleep on the couch for a few hours.</p><p>	At midnight, she rose from the couch, put a coat on, and went straight for the garage. And there it was, stashed under the half-torn box of oak floorboards, like an old friend: her trusty ladder that she’d used to spy on Agatha weeks ago. The binoculars sat on top of her worktop bench, glinting in the sickly white fluorescent light.</p><p>	Rio picked through her closet for her favorite heavyweight black denim coat, which was lined with wool. It was a coat that had survived community college, ex-girlfriends, that one night in jail, her first handywoman job, Evette, and a rather grumpy squirrel. </p><p>She took off her pajama pants and slipped into a pair of sweatpants, and then climbed up to the roof. Once there, she watched Agatha’s land through the binoculars.</p><p>	A breeze tickled the underbrush in the field, and Rio saw a familiar figure: the scarecrow. She smiled; he was an old friend at this point. Not long after, Agatha emerged from her house, in a black satin nightgown, marching toward the field. </p><p>	Rio could only see the back of her head, recognizable by that wild mane of dark brown hair. </p><p>With each step, the weeds and brush obscured Agatha’s form until Rio could only see the top of her head and her shoulders, just a few feet away from the witch scarecrow. There she stood, like history beheld, with her arms at her sides. It was as if she were—</p><p>	“You’re sleepwalking,” Rio whispered to herself. It was so obvious, but she never realized what it was that Agatha was doing until now. Until she really saw her. </p><p>	A gust of wind ripped through the field again, and only Agatha remained still. She must’ve been cold, but Rio didn’t move from her post. She continued her watch. </p><p>	At this moment, she confessed something to herself: that her lust for Agatha had never waned. Even after she’d been rejected, Rio couldn’t help herself. She was merely a red-blooded human being, swept in by a brooding, perplexing, blue-eyed tide. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	The following morning, Rio started her day at the hardware store, her safe place. It was baked into her routine so many days of the week that she felt disoriented on days she didn’t stop by. The tumultuous tornado that tore through her internal monologue hadn’t relented. </p><p>	Last night, like ritual, she ruminated on Agatha for hours on end, indulging in all the memories of their interactions. It was the only way she fell asleep.</p><p> 	One moment, she fixated on her primal desire for Agatha, imagining what she would’ve done on that fateful night at Jen’s bar. The visions flashed through her mind in remnants, vivid and vague at the same time.</p><p>Rio would’ve buried her nose in Agatha’s brown hair, inhaling and memorizing her scent. She would’ve stripped that black shirt off, kissing her neck and working her way down to her chest, while her hand worked, wandering down her jeans. She would’ve savored the wetness and warmth between her legs, and finally tasted the exhalation of Agatha’s pleasure—</p><p>But the next moment, her fantasy was interrupted with nebulous, directionless feelings of something entirely different. She didn’t want to stop at consummating her curiosity for Agatha’s sensuality and ecstasy—but she had to stop. Some things were not meant to be. </p><p>She hoped that seeing Lilia would set her straight.</p><p>	Rio had sent in an order for two gallons of paint, rollers, edging brushes, and trays. Agatha had chosen a creamy mushroom color that would contrast well against the black French country sink cabinet that was delivered a couple of days ago.</p><p>Lilia whistled to the tune of Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5” and then broke out into a whimsical sing-along. She hit the higher chorus notes with ease. According to Jen, Lilia was known to make appearances at occasional open-mics and karaoke at the bar, and she slayed. </p><p>The “New Tools” banner hanging above the aisle closest to the counter called out to Rio, and she meandered into it. Between the woodworking router tracks and the gimmicky multi-tools, she found herself rationalizing and reasoning with whether she’d ever need to use any of these tools. </p><p>She studied an electric screwdriver, which came with a bendy attachment to get into tight spaces. It would’ve been handy when she took the cabinet down in Agatha’s bathroom. Tossing it into her basket, Rio moved onto the next gimmick. </p><p>There was a drill bit kit for stripped screws, and she remembered the stripped screws in the handle fixtures in the sink. Then, a set of specialty pliers, which could come in clutch for any other water-related or pipe-related issues in Agatha’s house. Or someone else’s. Rio justified it–she needed those for her job. </p><p>Another gimmick, another thought drifted towards Agatha. All roads led to <em>her</em>, no matter how tenaciously Rio fought the compulsion to think of her. The woman had kicked her down the road like a rock one kicks over and over along a walk. Yet, here Rio was, thinking of her. </p><p>She left the aisle and tried to push it all out of her mind.</p><p>“What’s got you frazzled?” Lilia asked, from across the counter. She tilted her head back, her sagacious nose sniffing out Rio’s internal turmoil.</p><p>Rio set the basket on the counter. “How do you <em>do</em> that?”</p><p>Lilia threw back her curly tendrils and widened her naturally eccentric eyes, signaling her excitement. “I see everything, Rio.” The phone rang, and she picked it up after the first ring without breaking eye contact. </p><p>She greeted the customer on the line, sandwiching the phone between her ear and shoulder while she scanned Rio’s paint and various tools. </p><p>“Mmhmmm…yep…right,” Lilia mumbled on the phone. “Mmmmhmmm. We do. That, too. You’re also going to need a cement mixer. Just trust me.” She thanked them and hung up the phone. </p><p>“So, back to you,” Lilia said, “how’s the job for Agatha going? She’s got you off the market for a week, and I’ve got a whole new rotation of handymen and frantic customers asking for recommendations.” </p><p>Rio shrugged with hubris; her father had taught her to work well and to work fast. “Hey, send them my way. I’ll put them on the schedule.” She was making a name for herself already in Westview faster than she’d thought possible. </p><p>Lilia repeated, “How’s the job?” </p><p>“It’s fine. All of it is going fine,” Rio lied. </p><p>“Is that why you’ve got bags under your eyes and why you’re on your second cup of coffee?” Lilia clicked her tongue and nodded her head at the veins pulsing in Rio’s dancing fingers. </p><p>Rio stopped drumming the counter abruptly. “I might’ve had an extra cup this morning because I haven’t been sleeping well lately.” Her poker face immediately went slack, and she tried to remember if she put foundation on this morning.</p><p>“Good God, what is that woman doing to you?” Lilia asked. “Is she threatening you? Is she blackmailing you?”</p><p>“Jeez, Lilia, no!” Rio peered left and right, and over her shoulder, to make sure the other customers wouldn’t hear their conversation.</p><p>Lilia pressed her lips together, and cocked her head to the side. “So is she simply so pleasant that you’re losing sleep?”</p><p>“She’s been…a little volatile,” Rio revealed. </p><p>Groaning, Lilia exclaimed, “I warned you, didn’t I?” She rubbed her temples with her fingers, took a deeply labored breath, and asked Rio for more details.</p><p>“One minute, I think we’re really getting somewhere, really building a friendship, and then the next, she shuts me out,” she said. “The other night, she said we weren’t friends, and that she couldn’t trust me. And then yesterday, she told me about her mom and I thought she was going to cry.”</p><p>“What did she say?”</p><p>Rio didn’t say. “It’s a little too personal, I don’t–”</p><p>“She’s cold, and then she’s ‘too personal’? Which one is it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Does it matter?”</p><p>Those words ate at her, once again.</p><p>Lilia pointed her pen at Rio, and readjusted her glasses, as if she would be able to see through her. “Don’t be young, doll. What is it that you want with her?”</p><p>Rio thought the answer would come to her, but then it occurred to her that she’d never answered that question in her mind. “I don’t know,” she finally mustered. </p><p>	A customer wandered behind Rio, and asked Lilia where he could find aluminum flashing. </p><p>	Lilia gestured over Rio’s head. “End of aisle seventeen.” She clicked through something on the computer, holding her index finger up at Rio. Then, she turned her attention back to her and took her glasses off. “How much longer do you have for the job?”</p><p>	“A few days.”</p><p>	“Listen, you’re a grown woman. Figure out what you want,” Lilia said. “But for now—you have a few days left in her dominion—you’re the best chance at figuring out what she’s hiding. Don’t let this be a waste.” </p><p>	“I saw her last night in the field, sleepwalking,” Rio noted, absentmindedly. Lilia had a presence that drew absolute honesty from her. </p><p>	“Probably guarding whatever it is she’s got back there,” Lilia said, lowering her voice as the door clanged. “Look, get it out of your system, but be rational. Why the hell did she turn down ten million dollars for those weeds?”</p><p>She slammed her hand down on the counter and slid the cans of paint over to Rio. There can’t be a good answer,” she warned.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*	*	*	</p><p> </p><p>Rio spent the rest of the morning painting Agatha’s bathroom, applying a thick coat first and then going over it again. She put on a pair of headphones and listened to The xx on repeat. She gravitated towards <em>Coexist </em>the most, channeling her directionless yearning alongside the sparse, echoe-y guitar lines and the poetic lyrics. </p><p>Agatha said hello once and then went to her office, seemingly more distant than before. She bounded up and down the stairs a few times, in all her gorgeous glory, clad in a white jumpsuit with black pinstripes. Rio snuck a few peeks, not lying to herself any longer.</p><p>She’d put down three coats of paint by lunchtime, and Agatha knocked on the door frame. “You work fast, Vidal.” </p><p>Rio said thanks robotically. Setting her paint roller down in the tray, she poured some paint into a plastic red bucket and grabbed an edging brush. </p><p>This was her least favorite part of painting. She tended to go too fast and paint always accumulated on her fingers at some point. </p><p>Agatha lingered. “Are you going back home for Thanksgiving?” </p><p>Glancing up, Rio raised her eyebrows. There she was again, with her Agatha™ shenanigans. “No. Besides, this is home for me now. Why?”</p><p>She shrugged, sheepishly, observing Rio as she painted, dabbed, and painted. “I thought you’d go back and see your mom or family, or. . .” </p><p>	Rio shook her head. She stayed strong, letting Agatha carry the conversation this time. “What is it, Agatha? I’ve got painting to do on your dime.” </p><p>	“Well, I’m spending Thanksgiving alone, obviously. You’re spending it alone—”</p><p>	“I mean, I said I’d be here, but not that I’d be alone,” Rio said.</p><p>	Stunned, Agatha prattled on, “Oh, of course. Of course, you’re not gonna spend it alone. Why would someone like you…spend it alone? Anyway, listen, if you find yourself wanting to ditch that, I’ll be here.”</p><p>	Letting Agatha tie herself in knots, Rio dipped the brush into the paint and made a few broad strokes. “Is that an invitation?” she asked, at last.</p><p>	“Yes,” Agatha said from the corner of her mouth, barely audible.</p><p>	“What?”</p><p>	“Yes, it’s an invitation,” Agatha replied, louder.</p><p>	Rio was about to accept, but she couldn’t help the mudslinging. She was never above being petty for dramatic flair, and with Agatha, this might’ve been the only chance she could have the upper-hand. It was too good to resist. </p><p>“I’ll consider it,” Rio answered. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>That afternoon, Rio installed the new sink cabinet, making a mess of screws, drill bits, white caulk, and shims. She left the new piping under the sink, ready for tomorrow. She swept the splinters from the shims into her hand and threw them away in the kitchen trash. </p><p>Agatha suddenly barged into the bathroom. </p><p>Rio turned around and jumped back. “Christ, you scared me!”</p><p>	Inches from her face, Agatha asked, “Have you considered long enough?” She didn’t give Rio a chance to answer. “Why haven’t you said ‘yes’?”</p><p>	“Why don’t you trust me?” Rio rebutted. It was her gut; it’d taken over momentarily and distilled into this moment. She took in the delicious scent of Agatha’s hair product: a distinct cedar. </p><p>	Squinting at her, Agatha said, “Answer my question first.”</p><p>	Rio looked her in the eyes, reading the curve of her nose and lips and studying the wily angles of her jaw. But she couldn’t see past her battle-hardened visage through to what she was really thinking and feeling. God, she was distractingly gorgeous. All the same, Rio had to engage in this song and dance.</p><p>So, she said, “I’m going home.” Rio slipped past Agatha, and their bodies brushed against each other. </p><p>Agatha did not go after her. </p>

<p>Alice grunted. The veins in her arms popped out and sweat poured from her forehead. </p><p>	Rio wheezed. Her thigh muscles bulged and pulsated with pain. Her lower back was slick with sweat.</p><p>	“<em>Uhnnghh</em>, almost—-there—<em>oh, god</em>,” Alice panted.</p><p>	“You can do it, c’mon,” Rio encouraged. </p><p>	Alice raised the barbell above her head at last, and then immediately dropped it down on the green weight mat. </p><p>	Rio dropped into one more squat and then propelled herself up and racked the barbell on her shoulders back into place. “<em>Whew</em>!” </p><p>	“Curls, next,” Alice said. </p><p>	Nodding, Rio followed her past the lat pull-down machines to a sliver of black mat adorned with four benches, in front of the wall of mirrors. She yanked twenty pound dumbbells from the weight rack. </p><p>	“So, have you made any progress?” Alice asked, adjusting a bench into a sitting position. She grabbed the thirty pound dumbbells and sat down. </p><p>	“Barely,” Rio exhaled, curling in her tan, defined right arm as she observed herself in the mirror. She’d spent another day at Agatha’s house, likely one of the last, installing the pipes under the sink, attaching water hose and valves, and attaching the cabinet doors, along with the hardware. </p><p>In between all these tasks, she’d probed about Mephisto and the ten million dollar investment, to which Agatha immediately clocked her. </p><p>	“And what’d you say?’ Alice asked, finishing a set. </p><p>	“I said I looked her up out of curiosity,” Rio admitted. She’d seen the way Agatha blushed when she made her confession. It wasn’t <em>exactly untrue</em>, but it was disingenuous. “She was flattered, I think.”</p><p>	“Smart,” Alice said. “Did she tell you why she turned down the deal?”</p><p>	Rio remembered the sudden pallor of Agatha’s face, like life had drained from her body. Agatha had told her she didn’t want those pesky developers excavating and mining her land for precious metal for the next flash-in-the-pan startup. </p><p>Then, she’d changed the subject, snapping at Rio about the acrid smell of the plumbers’ cement in the bathroom. Rio didn’t dare ask about the backyard again; she wanted to live to see another day. </p><p>	“Look, she told me there’s no precious metal to be mined back there,” Rio said, her veins rushing with blood as she curled another set. “She said it would’ve been a waste and we never would’ve seen ten million.” </p><p>	Alice believed her. She cursed to herself in the mirror. “Where the hell does that leave us?”</p><p>	Unflinchingly, Rio kept up her web of lies, and the guilt crawled under skin, detaching it from muscle and bone. Was it always this easy for her to lie? </p><p>	Before Rio had walked out of her decade-long relationship, Evette had said, “The lies you told weren’t for me, they were for you.”</p><p>	The way she’d snarled it that night etched itself into Rio’s mind. It reverberated like a freight train barrelling through her ego and sense of self. Had she woken up and found that she was exactly the same person, but just chasing after a new woman?</p><p>	“—are you listening?” Alice smacked Rio’s bicep. </p><p>	“Alice, maybe she’s just a thorn in your side,” Rio said, through gritted teeth, watching her muscles flex and tighten. “Let’s do some tricep dips.”</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>Today was the last day Rio would be at Agatha’s house. It would be a simple, breezy day of work: installing golden and brass fixtures, hanging up the artwork Agatha had framed and ordered, and paint touch-ups. She’d be in and out and have the rest of the day off, and it was making her feel something she rarely felt: wistful. </p><p>Though Rio knew this probably wasn’t the last time she’d hear from Agatha, she couldn’t be sure. And without certainty that she’d see her again, the thunderstorm struck inside her core, keeping her up at night, alongside a sleepwalking Agatha.</p><p>Thanksgiving was tomorrow and Rio still hadn’t accepted Agatha’s invitation, which was undoubtedly rude, but her stomach flipped every time she thought about it. </p><p>She’d had dinner at Agatha’s house before, but this felt different. This was a holiday Rio had spent with Evette and her family; it was a holiday spent with people she cared about. This year, she’d fully expected to spend it alone. She was ready to spend it alone.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t asked again; she was far away yesterday, busy on various calls. Before Rio left for the day, she’d said she liked the way her corduroy camel work shirt made her look “handsome.” She’d said so absentmindedly and earnestly that Rio’s heart galloped away reactively. </p><p>When Rio arrived this morning, it took Agatha a minute to come to the door, and she seemed awfully tired, yawning into her billowy green sleeves. “Last day, huh?”</p><p>Could it be? Agatha Harkness was <em>cute</em> when she was sleepy? A featherlight joy filled Rio’s chest, even though her face hid it with a sly smile. </p><p>“Look, I’m sorry about yesterday,” Rio said. “I shouldn’t have asked about Mephisto. It was just my curiosity getting the best of me.” That, she meant. </p><p>“Oh,” Agatha intoned, her brow furrowed. “Okay.” </p><p>	And now Rio could see it: the awkward, lanky person under that shiny, hard shell. She saved Agatha another second of her discomfort. “I’m also accepting your invitation to Thanksgiving.” </p><p>	Agatha’s eyes gleamed with wakefulness. “Did your plans fall through?” she teased.</p><p>	“Well,” Rio said, “I decided I’d take pity on you.” She shoulder-checked Agatha, and suppressed the urge to grin at her.</p><p>	She wanted to fold like a cheap suit, rebuffing this dangerous tango, not knowing which Agatha she’d encounter each day, but the games lit a fire in the part of her that relished chaos. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio fastened the last handle onto the sink cabinet just after lunch. She called up to her at the foot of the stairs. Agatha didn’t answer. Rio called again. Still, no answer. She figured she was in a meeting, but her curiosity got the best of her.</p><p>	She reached for the walnut railing at the stairs, and quietly went up the stairs, her steps dampened by the velvety, royal purple runner centered on each tread. Rio looked up, and a gallery wall of art looked back down on her. Once she reached the landing, she studied them closer.</p><p>	In the center of the gallery wall was a delicate, oval black and white photograph of a boy of five or six years old. He had dark hair, dark eyes, and a close-lipped smile that spelled mischief. His nose was thin but characteristically strong, and his round eyes were astute. His little chin was ever so slightly dimpled in the middle. </p><p>Rio tilted her head; there was no question that this was Agatha’s son. </p><p>	Around his photograph were various frames of different sizes, shapes, and materials, some frilly and vintage, some modern and square, some maple, walnut, and acrylic. </p><p>A preserved bunch of hemlock flowers tied together with twine hung upside down in a black square frame above the boy. There was a large painting of a spooky, barren forest in an ornate gold frame on the right. </p><p>On the left, there was a family of frames. One was a painting of a ghost in a jungle, looking towards the moon. One was a photograph of Agatha’s hand intertwined with a tiny hand. There was a yellowed piece of heavy stock paper with a melodic script across it. </p><p>	To the right of the landing was a bedroom and to the left was a hallway. Rio heard a faint purr, and Señor Scratchy emerged from the bedroom. He stood at Rio’s feet, glancing up at her, meowing, and tapping his tail from left to right. </p><p>	“Hi, you,” Rio said, leaning down to pet his tiny head.</p><p>	“Rio?”</p><p>	Agatha appeared from her office, which was the second door down in the hallway. “<em>What</em> are you doing up here?” Her eyes turned a harsh shade of dark blue. </p><p>	“Oh, I’m sorry—I just finished up downstairs and wanted you to—” Rio said, caught off-guard. Señor Scratchy scurried past Rio and down the stairs, vanishing.</p><p>	Agatha clenched her jaw. “<em>Why </em>are you up here?”</p><p>	Rio stammered, and her toes curled in her sneakers. </p><p>	“Just go. Now.” </p><p>	“Agatha, I—” </p><p>	She crossed her arms tightly against her chest, her face void of the Agatha that Rio knew. “<em>Get out</em>.”</p><p>	Rio pressed her lips together, putting up her own wall of defense. She nodded once and braved her way down the stairs, a lump in her throat. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	That evening, Rio stayed up, working on a chair down in the basement. She knew the router was loud enough for her neighbors to hear, but she didn’t care. Rio held the router against the edge of the wooden seat, drawing a Romanesque groove out. </p><p>She vacillated between anger, gloom, numbness, and yet, still, longing. Was it pathetic? Was this really what Rio had felt?</p><p>Using a chisel and mallet, she dug into a wooden leg aggressively, her mouth tight with concentration. In the workshop, she found a singular solace in this rote work. She knew what she was doing here, and she knew who she was here. But there was a chasm forming in the ground, under Rio’s boots, and her name was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>It took locking herself in the workshop to stop Rio from running to Agatha’s front door. She didn’t know what she would do next. She didn’t know what she would say. Would she ask, “Why the hell are you like this? What do you want from me?” </p><p>Would she ask about that beautiful little boy?</p><p>Did Agatha still expect Rio to come over tomorrow night? </p><p>Rio contemplated the choice she’d made to go up those stairs. Should she have gone up there? Or was it <em>not her place </em>as the handywoman to go up there? But it nagged at her, like the loose thread on her shirt; she was not just a handywoman to Agatha. That would be a truth too hard to swallow. </p><p>When it was late enough, Rio found herself on her roof once again, and she hated herself for being unable to overcome her compulsion to watch Agatha. </p><p>Tonight, Agatha didn’t wander out. Rio crawled to bed and shut her eyes, clutching a pillow to her chest as she curled into herself. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	Rio had spent the whole day waffling between calling Agatha, which would be a first, and simply showing up at dinner as planned. </p><p>	Eventually, she decided she couldn’t hand Agatha the satisfaction of winning this perverse game between them. She’d slipped into black slacks and a silky black shirt, with a pair of Heineken green leather Oxfords, with a notch cut out in the middle. It wasn’t either too formal nor too casual. She grabbed a bottle of white wine from the fridge and made her way to Agatha’s house.</p><p>	When she arrived at the front door, Rio took a deep breath, checked her reflection in her phone. Then, she knocked. </p><p>	After a lull, Rio could hear a shuffle and then a gallop of steps. The door swung open and Agatha stood there, dressed in a tasteful black long sleeved, wide-legged jumpsuit. The peephole neckline implored Rio to glance at her chest. Agatha looked up, meeting her glance. “Hi.” </p><p>Rio loitered on the porch, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Agatha looked beautiful, and it immediately distracted her from her anger. “I have wine,” Rio finally said. </p><p>“Come in,” Agatha said, accepting the bottle of wine.</p><p>Their hands touched. Rio’s hand trembled when she felt how warm Agatha’s hands were. </p><p>“I like that shirt on you,” Agatha said, as Rio followed her into the dining room. </p><p>Rio looked down at herself, flattered but also flabbergasted at how <em>normal</em> Agatha was being. As if yesterday hadn’t happened. Would it continue like this?</p><p>The dining room was dimly lit with a low light and candles on the table. A bouquet of flowers in a tin jug completed the table. Rio looked closer at the bouquet, and realized that those flowers were from Mr. and Mrs. Davis’ front yard. She shook her head. </p><p>Agatha told her to take a seat as she went away into the kitchen, putting on a pair of mittens. </p><p>She monologued to Rio about the preparation of dinner while she pulled a baking sheet from the oven and set it on the glass stove top. Two golden Cornish hens glistened with butter and rosemary under the rich, yellow stove lights. </p><p>	“I’m not big on recipes,” Agatha said, waving a tiny gold spoon in the air. She tossed butter on the hens a few times, and it rolled down the sides of their thighs luxuriously. It was almost lewd. “Listen, I’ll follow a recipe if I’ve never made something before, but after you cook chicken once, you’ve cooked all the birds, ya know?”</p><p>	“Can we—” Rio couldn’t get a word in.</p><p>	“For sides, I decided to go with roasted broccoli rabe with a creamy caper sauce.” She donkey-kicked the oven shut with grace only she could possess. “I have some rolls in the toaster oven and I also made a pumpkin pie. I don’t know if you like pumpkin pie, but too bad, we’re having it.”</p><p>	“Jesus, woman, slow down,” Rio grumbled. </p><p>	Still, Agatha proceeded. “I’ve had four espressos today and I think I may never sleep again. Oh, and I almost forgot, I made fried plantains for—”</p><p>	“Agatha!” Rio hissed. “Shut up for a second—wait, you made fried plantains?”</p><p>	Agatha’s eyebrows shot to her forehead. “You said you liked them a few weeks ago.” Her voice had shrunken into the size of a pea. </p><p>Rio was touched, the thin layer of ice around her heart immediately thawed and began to melt. But the layers had started to blend and mesh, and the short history between them weighed heavy on her shoulders. She flashed back to the black nothingness in Agatha’s eyes when she’d told her to get out yesterday.</p><p>“Vidal? You still with me?”</p><p>“What are we doing?”</p><p>With two plates in hand, Agatha innocently answered, “Having Thanksgiving dinner.” That innocence was undoubtedly a ruse. </p><p>Rio sighed. “No, I mean, what are we doing with each other? What am I doing here?”</p><p>“You’re here for dinner. Come on,” Agatha said, waving her over to the table. </p><p>Reaching for the plates, Rio’s hands palmed Agatha’s hands. “Stop, stop. Stop running from me, Agatha.” </p><p>Rio could see Agatha’s breath caught in her throat; she’d not expected her to be so forward. This woman had been accustomed to gaining the upper-hand, manipulating conversations and strong-arming people in some type of way, but Rio fought her fire with her own. </p><p>“Can we eat first? I don’t want to eat a cold dinner,” Agatha said, plainly.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose. “You’re lucky you have the face that you do.” Her stomach groaned in agreement. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio continued the game over dinner, tiptoeing around yesterday and the thing that was growing and mutating between them. </p><p>She talked about her father, which was out-of-character, and then about the chair she was building. Agatha poured the wine and kept their glasses filled and sloshing.</p><p>Rio asked Agatha about work and then about the places she liked to frequent in Westview. It was a disarming way to learn about someone, and the question had never disappointed Rio.</p><p>	Agatha mentioned Rusty Hill again, then a boutique shop she liked to buy her clothes from, and a lake just outside town she liked to hike around and picnic. Rio saw a real person sitting in front of her, but these little trinkets of her life still didn’t amount to unraveling the mystery that she was. Did it mean anything that she was telling Rio these things? She’d said so certainly a week ago that she didn’t <em>care </em>about the thing that was between them. </p><p>	Soon after dinner, they moved to the living room, lounging on Agatha’s couch. Rio sat on the right side and Agatha sat one couch cushion away, on the left. She rested her elbow on the top of the couch, and ran her fingers through her wavy hair. She pulled her legs in, her knees pointed at Rio. </p><p>	Not one second after they’d settled, Rio asked, “Okay, so what the hell happened yesterday?”</p><p>	Agatha smirked, her defensive shell shoring up like an instinct. “Look, maybe I overreacted, but you should know by now that I really don’t like people in my shit.”</p><p>	They went back and forth, ping-ponging cloying and crisp deflections. Rio had once savored these interactions, filling her quota for chaos, but now she couldn’t bear it anymore. All these nothing-isms had her running in place, arms outstretched towards nothing, in the dark.</p><p>	Finally, Rio broke. “<em>Dios</em>. We are grown, Agatha. I can’t do this anymore. This hot-and-cold thing—the whiplash. I-I can’t do it anymore.”</p><p>	Agatha didn’t answer. She blinked incredulously, as if Rio had stolen all the voice she had.</p><p>Rio continued. “You flirt with me and then you push me away. You tell me we’re not friends and it doesn’t matter to you what we are, but then you invite me to Thanksgiving dinner. And you pulled out the soft-lighting and the candles, does that scream ‘this doesn’t matter’ to you?”</p><p>“Tell me what you’re doing.” It wasn’t a question on purpose. It was a demand. </p><p>	“I don’t know,” Agatha said, absently. She tilted her head but kept her elbow resting on top of the couch. “I follow my instincts.” </p><p>	Rio mirrored Agatha, also opting to lean on the couch with her elbow. Inside, she found herself dazed with disbelief. She’d finally cornered Agatha’s amorphous spirit on this very couch, and there was nowhere to run. Her dark, vexed eyes coaxed Agatha to continue.</p><p>	“You’re not annoying, you’re not too political, you’re pleasant-looking, you’re handy, you’ve clearly got a green thumb—and it’s the strangest thing. I can’t seem to stop inviting you into my house and my very solitary life that I used to like.”</p><p>	“I started to feel. . .<em>lonely</em>,” Agatha said, like she’d eaten something slimy. “And you wouldn’t stop worming your way into my life, and I let you—and I don’t know why.”</p><p>	“You don’t know why?” Rio asked. “Do you mean that?”</p><p>	Agatha sucked her bottom lip in for a second. “I don’t know, it could be you. It could be the way you wear that shirt.”	</p><p>Rio battled the butterflies in her stomach and the smile wanting to reveal itself. But was this flattery just a distraction, yet again? Did she mean it? Was Rio this easy to play?</p><p>“It could be that it’s not so bad to have you around.” </p><p>Rio tucked her hair behind her ear and locked eyes with Agatha, still sitting far from her. “So, why are you hellbent on icing me out?” </p><p>	“It scares me,” Agatha confessed. She looked down at the couch cushion, meekly. “It scares me that my instincts are telling me that I want to be around you.”</p><p>	Scooting just inches closer, Rio asked, “Why?”</p><p>	She could see Agatha’s flight-or-fight kick in, her blue eyes vibrating left and right as she stared at Rio, frantically searching for an escape. Rio encroached, sitting even closer to Agatha, their knees touching. She wanted to reach out and wrap her fingers around Agatha’s wrist, but her nerves held her back. </p><p>	“Why are you scared?” Rio asked again, searching for her, searching for some intangible emotion hand she could hold. “Stay with me, Harkness.”</p><p>	Agatha sighed with surrender. “I don’t know if I can trust you.” </p><p>	It was as if Agatha had unsheathed a figurative knife and laid it upon Rio’s heart. What cut the deepest and swiftest was that Agatha was telling the truth. </p><p>The web of desire, torture, angst, and affection had buoyed up to the surface, and only made Rio want her more. She didn’t know what it meant. </p><p>	Rio followed her own instinct, and tested a theory. “Did you have a son?” </p><p>	And thus, she’d taken the symbolic knife and reversed it, and it’d landed. Agatha’s chest heaved with a labored breath, and her blue eyes rippled like the surface of a disturbed pond. </p><p>	Before she lost her, Rio stood up and reached her hand out. “Come here. You don’t have to face me to tell me.” She took Agatha by the hand and sat down on the right side of the couch, pulling her in against her chest, and they both leaned against the inner corner of the couch. She didn’t give her a chance to hesitate, and it was as if the spell had inverted: Agatha obeyed Rio’s spell now. </p><p>Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha as she curled her arms against her chest and held her hands together. She felt small, like a bird, in her arms, contrary to her larger-than-life persona. </p><p>	Agatha’s silence answered Rio. </p><p>	“Come here,” Rio whispered again, squeezing her arms around her, and bringing her head to her chest. Agatha lied against her without protest, and her legs rested on Rio’s legs, her body turned towards her. </p><p>The two idled with one another, their respiration eventually reflecting each other’s. </p><p>Rio buried her nose in Agatha’s hair, reveling in the intimacy of the moment, and closed her eyes. This moment wouldn’t last forever, and it might never come again. </p><p>	Rio wouldn’t ask another question of her; it would be cruel. Suddenly, none of that mattered.</p><p>She told herself she’d just rest for a minute, but soon, a blanket of quietude and peace fell upon the house, and she drifted to sleep with Agatha Harkness.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>	Morning light pried through the shutters, concentrating on Rio’s forehead. She lifted her left arm to block the sun from her eyes and looked down to find her right arm weighed down by a sleeping Agatha. </p><p>Suddenly alert, Rio blinked, making sure it wasn’t a dream. Agatha laid against her chest, her hand resting on her ribcage, her leg strapped across her body, holding her in place. Even when she was sleeping, Agatha was everywhere. </p><p>	Rio couldn’t believe that she’d <em>slept here</em>. She couldn’t believe that Agatha was <em>snoring </em>softly on her. She couldn’t believe that she snored and that a person could snore so delicately. Had Agatha gotten up and sleepwalked last night, or was she here the whole time? </p><p>Rio doubted it; she would’ve noticed all that fidgeting. Then again, she wasn’t the lightest sleeper. </p><p>	The thing between them was morphing into something new again. This felt too intimate, a step too far for where they’d started last night. But it felt so natural and it felt inevitable. </p><p>	Agatha’s hand suddenly tensed and seized Rio’s shirt. Her eyes wrenched open and she looked up at Rio, realizing that she was laying on her. </p><p>	“You’re…tickling me,” Rio said, apprehensively. </p><p>	Rio felt Agatha’s whole body tighten, like a cable had unfurled itself through her limbs.</p><p>	She looked at Rio, and Rio looked at her. And then she shattered the illusion of any headway they’d made last night. </p><p>	“I have a meeting at 9 AM,” Agatha blurted out, disengaging her arms and legs from Rio. </p><p>	“It’s the day after Thanksgiving,” Rio said. </p><p>	“We live in a capitalist hellscape, what do you expect?” She threw her hair back over her shoulders. “I gotta get ready and you gotta go.” </p><p>	Even when she pissed Rio off, she was pretty. Her eyeliner and mascara were still perfectly intact, untouched and unflaked. </p><p>	Rio sighed loudly and histrionically. “Alright, I’m leaving.” She grabbed her keys and phone from the table near the front door. She didn’t have it in her this morning to dig through the stratum of Agatha’s endlessly complex layers. So, she left and went to Jen’s, which had become a third place for her. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Jen poured Rio a glass of club soda and slid the glass across the counter. The bar was open for staff, family, and friends. Billy lorded over a booth, where Alice and Lilia sat with an unidentified young man with shoulder-length dirty blond hair. He waved at Rio.</p><p>	“The prodigal baddie returns!” Billy exclaimed. “Rio, this is my brother, Tommy,” Billy said, gesturing to the young man with the luscious hair. </p><p>	Rio introduced herself and shook his hand. Billy and Tommy must’ve been fraternal twins, because the only facial feature that tied them together was those insightful eyes–and even those were different colors. Tommy had a pair of greyish-green eyes. </p><p>	Everyone wore their post-Thanksgiving best: velour sweatsuits, sweatpants, loose jeans, and comfy hoodies and sweaters. </p><p>Jen came over and scooted into the booth, next to Lilia. “Next round, let’s go,” she commanded, wagging her finger in a circle. They’d been playing a game of Skip-Bo and Alice was winning. </p><p>	“And how was your Thanksgiving?” Lilia asked. </p><p>	Alice shot Rio a look. “Yeah, how was it?”</p><p>	Rio pulled up a chair and sat in it like she was on television, the chair backwards and her arms resting on the seat back. “We slept together.”</p><p>	Everyone gasped. </p><p>	“I knew it—”</p><p>	“Not like that,” Rio said. “I mean, we literally fell asleep on the couch.” </p><p>	Billy blew a raspberry. “Laaaame.”</p><p>	Jen threw a card on one of the four piles on the table. “Well, what was it like?”</p><p>	Everyone at the table glanced at Jen with judgment as loud as the speakers bumping dance hall beats. “What? I wanna know.” </p><p>	The card game continued, each person lobbing cards on the table and drawing some. </p><p>	Rio didn’t divulge much. “She’s cute when she snores, okay? Is that what you wanna hear?.”</p><p>	Alice rolled her eyes and groaned. “You got it bad, Rio. Like, bad-bad.”</p><p>	“<em>Ugh</em>, just get her out of your system. Get in bed and get out,” Lilia chimed in. “That <em>is</em> what you want, right?”</p><p>	Everyone turned to examine Rio. She bit her bottom lip, readying herself to spill the beans, but instead retorted, “Is Westview really so boring that my personal life is news?” </p><p>She didn’t know what it was that she wanted. The lust resided in her core, burning, but there was something else commingled in there. Something she couldn’t identify, and something that made her arm break out with goosebumps.</p><p>This morning, she couldn’t stand Agatha, acting as if she hadn’t cried on her chest and told her that she couldn’t stop being around her. This <em>was </em>a mutual attraction, but Agatha was still running from Rio. </p><p>“I don’t know about you freaky little miscreants,” Jen said. “But I’m here for gossip. I, personally, have a date this weekend with the hot goth girl.” She blew a charming yet mocking kiss at Alice.</p><p>	“I think you and Agatha would be good together,” Billy said, popping a cube of gum into his mouth. </p><p>	Tommy piped up in agreement. “She’s funny, that’s a good sign, right?”</p><p>	“Okay, sure, everyone’s hot. But you don’t want to <em>date </em>Agatha Harkness, right?” Alice asked. </p><p>	Rio took a sip of her club soda and immediately burped. “She doesn’t do relationships.” <em>Did </em>she want to date Agatha? Even if she did, Agatha would never reciprocate. But was that the <em>something else</em> she was feeling?</p><p>	“So, all this groundwork, just to get into her pants?” Lilia asked. It was such an uncharacteristically vulgar thing for her to say that Rio narrowed her eyes at her with concern. </p><p>	“Oh, God, Lilia. I’m not a man,” Rio said. Though inside, she felt no better than a man, practically undressing Agatha with her mind any time she was alone. Was this all to sleep with her?</p><p>	She changed the subject with the finesse of a bear. “Did you guys know she had a son?”</p><p>	“What?!” </p><p>	“Yeah, I think he died,” Rio said. Quietude rushed through each of her friends. The atmosphere in the room became dry with severity. </p><p>	“That’s not in her files or records,” Alice said, her brown eyes flickering. She gathered her cards into a stack and placed them face down on the table. “How old was he when he died? When was this?”</p><p>	“I don’t know,” Rio said, “I saw a photo of him. He was young; maybe five or six.”</p><p>	“It would explain why she’s like that,” Jen said.</p><p>	“And you’re sure there’s no record of his death?” Lilia asked, pointing a card at Alice between her index finger and middle finger.</p><p>	“I’m certain,” Alice replied. “Maybe there are school records of him.” </p><p>	“You know, she used to babysit us,” Tommy said. His voice was raspy and lower than Billy’s, but they both spoke with a kind of confidence only they could possess. “Not for very long, but, still. I think she’d just moved here.”</p><p>	“Do you think that’s when her son died?” Billy asked.</p><p>	Nausea permeated through Rio’s bloodstream and rooted into her belly. She’d unleashed a snake into Agatha’s personal life, and it was sprouting heads, thrashing in all different directions, just to get her friends off her back. It was not worth it. </p><p>There was no taking it back now, and whatever she’d set in motion was plowing forward at a breakneck speed. This felt wrong and incongruous with who Rio was, but she seemed to spin words that turned into duplicitous threads no matter which way they came out. Maybe it <em>was </em>who she was.</p><p>	“Maybe—maybe we should let this one thing be,” Rio decreed.</p><p>	Lilia, Jen, and Alice all dissented, interjecting over each other. </p><p>	“I mean it,” Rio insisted. She chewed the inside of her cheek. “I don’t want to do this anymore. This is wrong.”</p><p>	“I could’ve told you that,” Billy ribbed from the corner of his mouth. </p><p>	Tommy chided him in a low voice, bashfully making eye contact with Rio. </p><p>	She said, “Listen, I really shouldn’t have said anything, and I’d appreciate it if you could keep this to yourselves.” </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	By nightfall, Rio raced to Agatha’s front door, like she’d dreamt before. An invisible force had propelled her up the road, and she couldn’t fight it any longer. She knocked on the door without a plan. </p><p>	“Agatha! It’s me,” she said. “Open up.” </p><p>	Pounding the door with her palm, Rio persevered. “I don’t care that you’re scared. We’ve gotta talk about this now.”	</p><p>	The house stood still, dark and silent. Not even the floorboards creaked. Agatha wasn’t home. </p><p>	Rio deflated her chest, patting down her black leather jacket, gathering herself. What if Agatha had come to the door? What would Rio have done? Talk? Reach for her? Run her fingers through those brown locks? Wrap her arms around her waist? Crumble?</p><p>	“Damn,” Rio growled, pivoting on the heel of her boot, starting down the path. She stuffed her hands in her back pockets and racked her brain for where Agatha could be. It was a Friday night; she could’ve gone anywhere, and it would’ve been a step too far to try every place she’d mentioned last night. </p><p>	This should’ve been embarrassing for Rio, chasing a woman like she was possessed, but she had a singular fixation right now. She couldn’t bear the uncertainty, the hanging in limbo, now that she knew Agatha <em>did feel something</em>. She’d all but admitted that she felt the same.</p><p>	Rio suddenly remembered she had Agatha’s number, from the first work ticket she’d sent in. Rio had never called her, though, because Agatha was such a hands-on client from the start, and there was never any need to call. </p><p>She pulled out her phone and dialed without hesitance, revved up with the adrenaline of going to the door.</p><p>	Agatha immediately picked up. </p><p>	“What!” It was less of a greeting and more of a holler. </p><p>	A bass guitar jammed through the phone, and the static of tinny snare drums came through seconds later.</p><p>	“We have to talk,” Rio said.</p><p>	“What?” </p><p>	“We. Have. To. Talk,” Rio stated. </p><p>	“I can’t hear you. Anywho, the band’s on. Bye!” </p><p>	The line went silent and Rio scoffed. This woman was impossible, and this was youthfully foolish. </p><p>But it didn’t take long for Rio to connect the dots, though. There was a band playing at Rusty Hill tonight. </p><p>She jogged home and jumped in her truck.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	When Rio arrived at Rusty Hill, she drove around the block where it resided, missing it twice. The only proof that the clandestine dive bar existed was its burnt orange exterior door, sandwiched between the best gyros in town and an accounting firm. 					As soon as Rio stepped inside the bar, she entered a different realm. The lights that hung from the ceilings were mismatched, and all of them were red, washing over the black and white checkered floors. There was an abundance of Monstera, snake, and spider plants in little and wide pots, lined against the wall, in corners, and in between tables. The tables and chairs looked like they’d come from a diner, made of some sort of linoleum and plywood. </p><p>	A grungy, indie band played a cover of Portishead’s “Glorybox” on the stage across from Rio. She stood on her toes and scanned the crowd of heads swaying to the music, looking for Agatha. </p><p>	Rio spotted her within a few seconds; it was as if she had a radar for where the best hair in the room was. Agatha leaned against the counter with a drink in hand, wearing the hell out of a deep green floral jumpsuit cinched at the waist with a flowy tie. Her sleeves were wide and dramatic, like her. Her neckline plunged down to her sternum. </p><p>Dank, weed smoke clouded the air, and the smell of cigarettes and body odor covered with Old Spice emanated through the bar. This was not how Rio had imagined Agatha spent her Friday nights. But what she’d imagined was a mere idealization of her. A dream, a wispy fantasy. This was real.</p><p>	Rio wasted no time getting to the bar, ordering a Cruzcampo beer and leaning against the counter next to Agatha. The counter was covered in national park stickers from various patrons, and a few amusing cactus stickers.</p><p>	“I love this song,” Rio said, watching the band, not looking at Agatha. </p><p>	“Me too.” </p><p>	A group of rowdy men shuffled past the two of them. </p><p>	“How’d you find me?” Agatha asked, taking a sip of her drink. She glanced at Rio briefly with laser heat. </p><p>	“You said you liked this bar,” Rio said. “And I heard the band.”</p><p>	They didn’t say anything else during the song. The guitarist played a muddled, ringing solo outro that entranced the entire room, Rio and Agatha included. </p><p>	Like tiny hammers in her ears, Rio’s heartbeat pounded, blood rushing to her appendages. A dizzying sparkle erupted in her core, fluttering up to her heart and collarbones. She couldn’t breathe when Agatha was around, and she didn’t know what she wanted from her but the full submission of her body. That was the certainty she knew. The other part, she was afraid of. </p><p>	“Did you mean what you said last night? That you want to be around me?” Rio asked.</p><p>	“Rio,” Agatha said, turning towards her. “I don’t want to talk right now.” </p><p>	Her reckless beauty put Rio in her place. She acquiesced with a strained, “Okay.” </p><p>	They watched the band play, nodding their heads and swinging their shoulders to the music. The band announced songs from their new album, and the people standing in front of the stage rocked back and forth, cheering and applauding. Agatha sprung from the counter and slithered into the crowd. </p><p>	Rio found herself rooted to her spot, simply watching Agatha; she was unable to move, petrified by how much she wanted her. </p><p>	Agatha disappeared into the crowd, but Rio could recognize her by her hands, up in the air. The veins in her witchy, pale hands called for her like a siren song. Her right hand drew downward upon her left arm as she danced to the harmony of echoing guitars, each pluck of the string resonated like a walloping heartbeat. </p><p>	Rio leaned back and cocked her head, fixating on Agatha every time she snuck a glimpse back at her. When Rio caught her gaze, she only saw Agatha and she hoped to God that Agatha saw only her, too. </p><p>But there was no way to know, not unless she asked, or physically astral-projected into her unreadable mind. And yet, Rio had fully surrendered herself to her, mesmerized by her, in the mosh pit of faceless, sweaty bodies, illuminated by the primal red lights. </p><p>	A thick cloud of smoke covered the room as several happy bar-goers took hits from their pens and hand-rolled joints at the end of the band’s penultimate song. Rio waved the smoke away and inhaled, for old time’s sake. When she looked up, Agatha had vanished from the crowd. </p><p>	Surveying the jumping and bumping pit, Rio desperately watched for Agatha, waiting to watch the crowd part, expecting her to emerge. She never did. </p><p>Rio handed the bartender cash and rushed out of the bar and into the street, where her truck was parked. She looked left and then right, but there was no sign of Agatha. The street was quiet, save for the dull hum of music and a car alarm going off in the distance.</p><p>	Her breath turned to vapor in the cold as she stood in front of Rusty Hill, lost and aimless. What the hell was Agatha playing at? Why was she like this? Was this a sign for Rio to follow?</p><p>	These questions were futile, because she would follow. She rummaged around in her pocket for her keys.</p><p>Every time Rio reached out, Agatha seemed to slip through the cracks like a phantom. But without fail, Rio grasped at her phantom, evaporating from her fingers, hoping she’d catch her one day. Even if that optimism was naive and misguided. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio drove home in dead silence, with her foot jammed on the gas pedal. As she crept close to the curb and parked, she saw a shadowy figure at her front door.</p><p>	She hopped out of the car and strutted to the door. She didn’t say anything. </p><p>	Agatha stood against the wall adjacent to the front door, with her arms behind her, her eyes fastened on Rio. </p><p>	Unlocking the door, Rio silently invited Agatha in, walking in front of her. When the door closed behind Agatha, Rio turned to face her. </p><p>	“Why do you keep running?” she snapped. “I want to talk to you.” </p><p>	Agatha shook her head. “I’m not here to talk.”</p><p>	Her dangerous eyes glinted like a knife, and Rio understood her. The air between them had shifted, charged with crackling electricity.</p><p>	She hung in limbo, unable to decide whether she should indulge or <em>ask </em>about what the hell this was. If she indulged—well, it would be delicious and unforgettable. </p><p>She couldn’t disentangle the knot in her stomach, not knowing what she was doing with Agatha, not knowing what she wanted. It had grown past lust, like Agatha’s overgrown weeds, the greenery threatening to take over her land. </p><p>But here Agatha was, staring her down, zeroing in on Rio, her intentions as clear as a crystal ball.</p><p>Rio <em>needed </em>her, like a forest on fire needed water. This feeling was so intense, she panted with something close to panic, her throat constricting and her lungs screaming for air. All of a sudden, she couldn’t look at Agatha for even one more second.</p><p>	“Turn around,” Rio blurted out. “I-I can’t look at you.”</p><p>	“Why?” Agatha froze, her face breaking into a bemused expression. Her blue eyes smoldered more than they usually did.</p><p>	Rio couldn’t catch her breath, her chest burning and tight. “Agatha, turn around.” Christ, if she didn’t, Rio would come apart at the seams.</p><p>	Agatha obeyed this time, at the behest of the hot-blooded look in Rio’s brown eyes. </p><p>	Standing behind Agatha, once again in this position, Rio’s chest pressed against her back, her lips close to her ear. She flashed back to that night at Jen’s bar, in that dressing room. And here they were once more, except that Rio knew she didn’t have to resist this time.</p><p>	Agatha turned toward her, their noses in a direct line across from each other. “What are you—”</p><p>	God, Rio wanted to kiss her, but she couldn’t <em>breathe</em>. Agatha was a bullet train accelerating on her tracks at full-speed, and the ground was crumbling beneath Rio’s boots. She’d gone from standing strong on firm ground to feeling completely disoriented as soon as Agatha looked at her like that. </p><p>Rio pulled the tie from Agatha’s waist and fastened it around her eyes. </p><p>A gasp fled from Agatha’s mouth. </p><p>	Then Rio stepped in front of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers found her forearm and tightened. “Rio,” she said, quietly. She turned her head, trying to find Rio. </p><p>	Taking her time, Rio absorbed the details of her face while those piercing blue eyes weren’t studying her, reading her barest desires. Agatha was stunning up close. </p><p>	“I can’t think when you look at me,” Rio confessed, her stomach sick with desire, confusion, and desperation. </p><p>	“What is there to think about?” Agatha wrapped her fingers around Rio’s hand and brought it to her mouth and kissed it. With every inch that her fingers climbed up Rio’s arm, she planted a soft kiss. And with every kiss, Rio grew weak, and she craved more. Was this really happening?</p><p>	“Agatha,” Rio said, barely holding her resolve. Her spine dissolved, and her knees buckled with a dizzying weakness. “We need to talk.”</p><p>	“Is that what you want <em>right now</em>?” Agatha’s lips curled as she found Rio’s neck, cradling her face with her warm hands. “To talk?” Her nose pressed into her neck as she nuzzled there, knowing exactly how to coax the desire from Rio. </p><p>She began to kiss her neck, and Rio reactively bit her bottom lip. When her hot breath reached her earlobe, an involuntary moan escaped her mouth. </p><p>	“Goddamn it, Agatha.” She throbbed below the belt. </p><p>	An answer would not reveal itself to Rio. Her immediate physical instinct was to meet Agatha where she was, giving into her touch. But intrinsically, she knew she wanted more and she needed to know that sex meant more. </p><p>	“What are you doing?” Rio asked, her voice faltering. </p><p>	“You know what I’m doing.” Agatha whispered in Rio’s ear, bringing her head close to her lips. “Please. I don’t want to talk.” </p><p>	A tingle ran down Rio’s spine while she teetered on the edge of surrender, but she wrestled against her reptilian impulses. “Wait, wait,” Rio said, “Wait.” She put her hand on Agatha’s hand and held it.</p><p>	Agatha pulled back, still blindfolded.</p><p>“This morning, you couldn’t wait to get me out of your house, and now you want me?”</p><p>	Scoffing, Agatha smacked her lips, breaking the tension purposefully. “Does this have to be so complicated? I really did have to work this morning—is that what this is about?”</p><p>	Rio glared at her, both aroused and incredulous at her attempt to deflect the truth. “Don’t be cute, Agatha. You fell asleep<em> </em>on me last night and you freaked out this morning. And now you <em>want me</em>?”</p><p>	“You want me and I want you,” she said. “That’s that. Right?”</p><p>	“Is it?”</p><p>	“Is this you letting me down easy?” Agatha asked. She tugged the tie off and smirked at Rio with the full power of her eyes. “You’re saying you don’t want to…?”</p><p>	Staggering back, Rio said, “I’ve thought about <em>this </em>every night.”</p><p>	The smirk shrunk from Agatha’s face. Her blue eyes gleamed with earnestness. </p><p>	“I thought we were on the same page,” Rio continued. “I thought…last night meant something. I thought you wanted the same thing as I did.”</p><p>	Agatha gathered herself, fastening the tie around her waist, and then crossing her arms. “I thought so, too. I thought it was <em>clear </em>what I came here for.”</p><p>	“It was,” Rio acknowledged. “But what if I want more?” The moment she uttered that question out loud, she’d laid down her cards for Agatha to see. This wasn’t a stupid game anymore. </p><p>	The seconds of silence seemed to protract, seeping into the heated air around them. Rio caressed Agatha’s face, tracing her bottom lip with her thumb. She afforded Agatha a little more time.</p><p>“I can’t give you more,” Agatha said, placing her hand over Rio’s, and then taking it. “I</p><p>know what I said last night. But I shouldn’t have offered something I can’t give.” She </p><p>kissed her cheek, her lips soft and supple. </p><p>She turned to leave, but Rio’s hand shot out, grabbing her forearm. Agatha’s eyes followed the line from Rio’s hand, up to her arm, and then to her sincere mouth. </p><p>Rio’s throat went dry.</p><p>She wanted to kiss Agatha, even if it was dangerous, but she couldn’t muster the bravado to do it. She’d never been one to shy away from indulging in her urges, but it was different when the woman on the other end could shatter her with such aplomb. </p><p>She let Agatha go and neither of them said good night. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>For the next week, Rio immersed herself in an ocean of jobs, keeping her arms sore and her back aching. She scheduled her days to the brim, leaving barely enough room to eat, sleep, and breathe. </p><p>She evaded her friends and cocooned into herself, not intending to emerge until winter was over.</p><p>Business was predictably good this time of year. Townsfolk had sent in tickets at an alarming rate, preparing their houses for the holidays to impress their in-laws. Some wanted their Christmas lights hung, some wanted their kitchen cabinets painted, some relented and finally called Rio to clean that one pesky slow-draining tub. </p><p>She didn’t have a chance to see Agatha; and for that matter, she didn’t want to see her. It was a fool’s errand to continue pursuing something with Agatha. She’d so roundly and openly said that she couldn’t give Rio what she wanted. What was Rio <em>thinking</em>? </p><p>Her thinking was clouded by lust, evidently.</p><p>In some way, Rio appreciated how upfront Agatha was, even if the way there was a ridiculously winding road.</p><p>Now she had to move on. It was that simple. </p><p>It was deceptively simple.</p><p>Rio didn’t know whether she could be around Agatha, merely as a friend, but were they even friends now? She dug through the introspective dirt clogging up her mind, defining friendship in different facets: socially, philosophically, psychologically, and emotionally. All this intellectualizing led her nowhere, though. Rio groaned and shook her head, attempting to shake it off. </p><p>She’d never <em>brooded over </em>anyone like this. And she hated to dwell. </p><p>A woodpecker jackhammered above Rio’s head, in a magnolia tree somewhere near the roof. The distraction allowed her to bury her angst deep. She continued to clean out the gutter for the Jones’ house. They were the last job of the day.</p><p>	Dottie had called Rio the night prior, hyperventilating about watching the heavy rainfall pour down the windows at the front of her house. So, here Rio was, up on the ladder, scooping leaves out of the gutter. This was one of her least favorite jobs, but people were happy to pay the premium for it.</p><p>	Of course, while she was at this vantage point, Rio snuck a few glances at Agatha’s house, wondering if she’d catch a glimpse of her around. She did not. </p><p>	Rio scoffed at herself. She climbed down the ladder and then readjusted it to another corner of the house. She climbed back up, ten feet off the ground, and stretched forward, grabbing leaves and hocking them in a pile below her. </p><p>Checking her wristwatch, she began to stretch and grasp at leaves with more haste. It was almost five and the evening was fast descending. </p><p>	She looked down and didn’t move the ladder, reckoning she could clean a few more inches before readjusting. Rio strained to the left with one arm and with the other, she kept her balance on the slightly pitched roof. “Bastards,” she hissed, fingers barely reaching far enough. </p><p>	Suddenly, her steadying hand slipped on the wet roof and she felt the ladder wobble and swing under her. </p><p>	“<em>Mierda!</em>” </p><p>	It happened instantaneously. Rio didn’t even get the chance to shut her eyes or brace for impact. She watched the bruised evening sky flip up and she fell like a sack of potatoes, hitting the ground with a sickening <em>thump</em>. </p><p>	The ground knocked the air out of her lungs and everything went black, like the plug had been pulled from the television.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> <em>“Rio. Rio?” </em></p><p>
<em>	“Oh, my God.” </em>
</p><p>
<em>	“Where is the ambulance?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>	“Rio, look at me.” </em>
</p><p>
<em>	“Oh, thank God. Sweetheart, she’s waking up.” </em>
</p><p>
<em>	“Can you hear me, Rio?” </em>
</p><p>	The sounds of chatter seeped into Rio’s ears. Next, the scent of rain and the stench of muddy gutter leaves. She could taste blood in her mouth: a bitter, metallic flavor. And then she opened her eyes and saw the sky. Rio blinked.</p><p>	She felt a hand caressing her cheek.</p><p>	A familiar face drifted into view, and she had two heads. Agatha’s hair hung over Rio, tickling her neck. </p><p>	“Hey,” Agatha said, breathlessly, grazing Rio’s cheek with her thumb. Her face was gaunt and pale with worry. Her eyes glistened. “Stay awake, Rio, okay?” </p><p>	Rio’s tongue froze in her mouth, limp and unmoving. She couldn’t speak, and the stupor of the fall had tucked her in like a weighted blanket and she felt lethargic, nauseated, and confused all at once. </p><p>	Phil and Dottie stood over Rio, behind Agatha, watching her with their hands clutched on each other. </p><p>	Shifting on her back, Rio felt her neck stiffen with an excruciating stab. She grunted. </p><p>	“Don’t move, don’t move,” Agatha urged, cradling Rio’s neck with a firm, but tender hand. Rio felt the anguish in her eyes, floating right there at the surface, raw. </p><p>	Sirens blared, approaching the house. Rio grit her teeth at the volume of the sirens, each whoop like a roundhouse kick to her temple. The wood chips in the mulch beneath her poked into her body. She could feel grit and damp soil between her fingers, too. </p><p>	The ambulance pulled up to the curb and two paramedics hopped out the back with a stretcher. One was a burly man with a buzz cut. The other was a tall, black-haired woman with austere features. One paramedic picked Rio up in his tree-like arms and set her down on the stretcher, while the other stabilized her neck with a brace. </p><p>	Through her confusion, Rio stirred and reached her arm out. “What’s happening?” She barely managed to get the words out, with a weak, hoarse voice. </p><p>Agatha’s figure shrunk and shrunk, until Rio found herself in the back of the ambulance van, staring up at the sterile steel ceiling. </p><p>	The paramedics took her blood pressure, listened to her pulse, scribbled things on a clipboard, and spoke to each other in medical jargon. Rio’s eyelids started to feel heavy, but the woman snapped her fingers. She gruffly told Rio to stay awake.</p><p>	For the rest of the ride to the hospital, Rio veered into a dazed state, and her life seemed to slow to a crawl. She had all the time to introspect, but her mind was spacey, like an egg yolk being swirled around from side to side.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	Westview University Hospital lumbered at five stories tall, a regal moss-washed red brick building with two great, conical spire roofs on each side. Vines and ivy grew in patches on the brick. </p><p>Inside, nurses and hospital personnel transferred Rio to a bed and carted her past the ER, which was a flash of cacophony and beeps and whirs, and into a private room in the urgent care wing. </p><p>	Twenty minutes later, a doctor glided into the room and introduced herself. Rio didn’t catch her name; it was as if her brain could only process every other sentence. Though, her vision had recovered quickly. </p><p>The doctor was an aloof white woman with gray hair and a pair of Aviator glasses. She wrote a few notes down on her paperwork, clamped onto a clipboard. “Alrighty, can you tell me your name?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal.”</p><p>The doctor asked for her date of birth, her address, and other personal details which would quickly determine how badly she’d fallen.</p><p>Poking and prodding at Rio, the doctor acknowledged her sporadically, squinting and shining her pen flashlight in her eyes. </p><p>	“Can you follow the light?”</p><p>	Rio did the best she could. </p><p>	“Alright, Rio, we’re going to do some reflex tests, a memory test, coordination and balance.”</p><p>	Someone knocked on the door and entered. </p><p>A nurse took over charting while the doctor instructed Rio to perform a series of tests. First, Rio stood and balanced on one foot and then the other. Then, she memorized and recalled a list of words. And then a few more in the same vein, testing her physical coordination and mental acuity. </p><p>	After they finished the tests, the doctor relayed jargon to the nurse in a hushed voice. “Two,” the doctor said. “No MRI, no CT scan needed.” </p><p>	Then, she rolled her chair closer to Rio, facing her, and said, “So, you’ve had what we call a grade two concussion, since you lost consciousness for just a couple of minutes. The mulch and leaves must’ve broken your fall and absorbed most of the impact.” </p><p>“Yeah, everything’s coming back to me now. So, can I go home?” </p><p>“Not for tonight. We want to keep you for observation–even though you’re alert now—because we need to monitor for post-concussion symptoms. Good news is, based on the tests and how you’re responding to stimuli, we won’t need to do a scan unless you start feeling nauseated, confused, vomiting, or feeling oddly anxious or agitated.”</p><p>“So, what do I do in the meantime?” Rio sat up in the bed, realizing she was still in her coveralls. The paramedics had wiped it down a bit, so it wasn’t completely mucked while she laid down. </p><p>The doctor tittered. “You need rest. Just take it real easy for the next two days. Don’t do anything strenuous, ‘kay?”</p><p>Rio thanked her as she glided out of the room, off to probe some other patient with her warm, liver-spotted hands. The nurse finished her notes and then pointed out a button near the left-hand side of Rio’s bed, in case she needed help. </p><p>Before the nurse left, she asked, “Oh, before I forget. Did you want to call a friend or family?”</p><p>It was then Rio remembered that when she woke up after the fall, Agatha was there, hovering over her. She wouldn’t call Lilia, Jen, or Alice, either. She was like her father in this way; she didn’t want them to worry and she wasn’t sure if they were close enough.</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment, but then shook her head. The nurse nodded and left the room.</p><p>As soon as she was alone, exhaustion shot through Rio, and her head hit the blue hospital pillow with resignation. </p><p>She hated to admit it, because she was too damn old to admit it, but she needed<em> </em>someone to lean on tonight. She’d never slept at the hospital and she was frightened, cold, and glum. It was a lonely, sterile place. </p><p>The truth was mundane, though. It was accessible and uncomplicated. Rio wished Agatha had gotten in the ambulance with her and she wished that Agatha was here with her now. </p><p>Rio could barely remember the moment before she fell off the ladder, but it was as if the concussion had rewinded the tape of her memories and tripped at one spot, playing that part over and over. </p><p>It was the look on Agatha’s face right before she left Rio’s house on the last night they spoke. When Rio had clutched onto her arm, it was unclear even to herself, what her intentions were. She just didn’t want Agatha to go.</p><p>But it was that yearning, hopeless look in her wayward blue eyes that Rio kept ruminating on. It haunted her. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	It’d been about an hour after Rio fell asleep when the door cracked open and the automatic lights fired up. Though they were soft white lights, they still made it hard for Rio to open her eyes. She blinked and squinted, struggling to adjust. </p><p>	“Finally. There you are,” Agatha said, clumsily shutting the door behind her and tripping into the room.</p><p>	Rio peered at her, unable to interpret her own reaction. Her shoulders released the tension stuck there, uncoiling. The wounds of last week rushed to the surface of her skin, and she flushed heat across her cheeks and chest. “Agatha? Are you really here?”</p><p>	“They wouldn’t let me back here as a visitor,” Agatha said. “I may have stolen a badge and tried every single door in this wing. Scared an old crone to <em>death</em>. And, of course, they put you all the way over here.”</p><p>	Rio’s stomach fluttered. Agatha had come to her. She was really here.</p><p>	“Didn’t think I’d see you again today,” Rio murmured. “Unless, you weren’t actually there when I was on the ground. Maybe I imagined your two heads.”</p><p>	Agatha wormed her way over bashfully, loitering at the foot of Rio’s bed. “You didn’t know? I’m the two-headed witch of Westview.” She was in a gray sweater and a pair of blue jeans, which was more casual than her usual wardrobe. </p><p>	It was as if they were inhabiting a different timeline, as if last week had never happened.</p><p>	“How’d you know I was there?” Rio asked.</p><p>	“I watched you fall out of the sky.”</p><p>	“You were watching me?” Rio asked, ignoring everything else. </p><p>	Agatha rolled her eyes and ignored her back. “Phil and Dottie were <em>not </em>panicking quietly, let’s just say that.”</p><p>	She got closer, lacing her fingers together, wringing her hands. “You scared us.” She stammered on, unable to make eye contact with Rio. “I mean, you scared me, and also them, because you fell and then you were just laying there, completely unresponsive.” Agatha cleared her throat. “What’d the doctor say?”</p><p>	“I’ll be fine,” Rio assured her, filling in all the details from the doctor. “I just won’t ever leave my bed again,” she said. “And I’ll have to reschedule Mr. Lee, Herb, Jack, and the Bettanys. Though, Herb just needs a new bathroom fan installed. I could—”</p><p>	“Rio, don’t.” Agatha insisted, her eyes soft and genuine. “That’s a threat.” She masked her tenderness with a shade of discomfort.</p><p>	Rio stretched her legs and cracked her neck. “Oooh, scary. While you’re threatening me, you think you can find those disgusting little pudding cups around here?”</p><p>	Agatha raised her eyebrows, unimpressed, but Rio somehow knew she’d agree to these demands.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	The nurse checked in only once after 9 PM, not recognizing Agatha, and only nodding at her without much fanfare. She took Rio’s vitals and left.</p><p>	Agatha had scrounged up chocolate pudding and, inexplicably, a catering tray of baba ghanoush, hummus, pita bread, spinach dip, and other appetizers. Rio asked where she managed to find palatable food in a hospital, and Agatha only grinned and shrugged. </p><p>	Agatha sat in a chair next to Rio, using her left leg crossed over her right as a makeshift table. They chatted over their spoils of war until they’d whittled away the whole tray. </p><p>The tightrope that Rio walked with Agatha perfectly tautened and gave as they talked. Greenly and hopelessly, she never wanted this state of equilibrium and comfort to end.</p><p>	“You know, I wasn’t the biggest fan of baba ghanoush when I was young and foolish,” Agatha said. “It really grew on me after we moved back, and this new family had opened a Mediterranean place on the east side. Westview was mostly corn dogs and burgers before then.” </p><p>	“We should go some time,” Rio said, absentmindedly. </p><p>	“What? Like a date?”</p><p>	Rio’s tongue knotted itself, over and under and sideways. “No, no, not like that. I just mean at some point, you and I could check it out, or you know, just me. I could go by myself. What did you say it was called?”</p><p>	“Oh, God, uh…” Agatha hesitated, as she pulled out her phone to look up the place. But then she fidgeted, coming back to the question of whether this was a date or not. Her mouth twitched, and what came out was unintelligible. “I—are you—Rio, I’m not—I can’t—”</p><p>	Rio tried desperately to quash this blooming discomfort between them, threatening to disrupt the equilibrium. “Oh, I’m not—it’s not a—” </p><p>	They exchanged an awkward barrage of interjections, cringes and grimaces. </p><p>	“Let’s just pretend like I didn’t say that,” Rio proposed. </p><p>	“I know what I said last week—”</p><p>	“I know, I know,” Rio blurted out. She couldn’t bear to hear those words again. She didn’t want to rip open the stitches holding her sanity together now. “We don’t have to talk about last week.”</p><p>Now she was leaning over the precipice, staring into the abyss where she and Agatha were back and forth, speaking and not speaking, feeling and unfeeling. Rio yanked herself back onto land. </p><p>“Let’s just forget about that,” she said, with more conviction. </p><p>They left the conversation suspended for a minute before Agatha began cleaning up and gathering her belongings. “I should head out,” Agatha said.</p><p> “Wait,” Rio said, her eyes glazed as she reached out and touched the top of Agatha’s hand, obliviously. “You said, ‘after we moved back.’ Who did you move back with?”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, cautiously. </p><p>Though her mind was mired in molasses, Rio put the pieces together. “You moved back with your son, didn’t you? That photograph in your house that I saw, that was your son, wasn’t it?” </p><p>Exhaling, Agatha looked down and then back at Rio, her eyes brimming with that steely resolve she was known for. “Yeah. That was my son.” </p><p>“What was his name?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “Nicholas. He liked to go by ‘Nicky.’”</p><p>	Rio tilted her head, inviting Agatha to come closer. “What was he like?” She scooted aside on the bed and gently coaxed Agatha by the elbow to sit next to her. </p><p>	Lost in thought, Agatha softened. “Nicky? God, he was brilliant. He was so smart, so perceptive, so…<em>good</em>. He always asked the cashier at the grocery store if they were having a good day.”</p><p>	Rio smiled. She’d never heard Agatha talk about someone so lovingly. </p><p>	Agatha continued. “He had a gift with music.”</p><p>	“What’d he play? How old was he?”</p><p>	Agatha did a double-take at Rio, as if she were caught off-guard by the questions. Leaning against the pillow with Rio and settling onto her back, she gazed up at the ceiling. </p><p>	“He was six,” she whispered. “I got him a toy piano when he was three and he picked it up wickedly fast. I know that’s what parents say about their kids, but I’m not joking. He was playing ‘Ode to Joy’ on the second day.”</p><p>	“That’s incredible,” Rio enthused, turning her body to watch Agatha. She didn’t ask the obvious, inquisitive questions that were engraved in her mind; even speculation about what happened to Nicky felt wrong.</p><p>	Instead, she asked, “What’d you guys like to do together? How’d you spend your weekends?”</p><p>	Agatha continued to count the ceiling tiles, as if it was therapeutic, her eyes flitting back and forth. “He really, really loved waffles. Specifically, blueberry walnut waffles. I’d sleep in on the weekends, but not much, because he’d get so excited, he’d still wake me up at 7:30.” </p><p>	Beaming, she went on, telling Rio about how they’d make the batter together, perfecting it over several weekends. One weekend, it was just a blueberry batter, and then the next, walnuts. And then, there was cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Eventually, they naturally took up their roles of head chef and sous chef, where Agatha spread the batter and Nicky deemed the level of blueberries and walnuts necessary for each waffle. </p><p>“He was a waffle connoisseur, that boy,” Agatha said. </p><p>Rio relaxed into Agatha’s voice, until she fell into a hibernating slumber, letting go of her fear of being alone in the hospital. That fear seemed so far away and trivial now. </p><p>The next morning she jolted awake, tucked into the gills, with two more layers of hospital blankets and a better pillow. </p>

<p>This December was unusually rainy and humid. Westview had grown accustomed, even entitled, to snowfall that would coat the town with perfectly powdery snow.</p><p>Rio spent the last day slinking to and from the bed and the couch, donning a set of green sweats and a head of tousled hair. </p><p>She’d called and rescheduled her jobs with everyone, to which she was greeted with well-wishes and “Oh my God, don’t even worry about it.” An unnamed neighbor had even sent a basket of bread, squash, and soup. </p><p>	Rio was a restless person; she seldom had time on a usual day. But the doctor had expressly instructed her to recuperate, and all she had was time. She always felt like she was clinging to the base of a candle wick, and it was constantly burning down, singeing the hairs on her knuckles.</p><p>	She curled up on the couch under a weighted blanket, and turned on a marathon of <em>Kitchen Nightmares</em>. Two episodes in, Agatha showed up at her door, with dinner in hand. It was as if the future had rippled backwards suddenly, because Rio had felt in her bones that Agatha would come to her house tonight.</p><p>	This felt even more comfortable, too comfortable, even. Agatha was wearing a heather gray knit sweater with a pair of boyfriend blue jeans. Extremely comfortable. </p><p>	“This is cute,” Rio said, pointing up and down at her. </p><p>	“I know,” Agatha said. She whizzed past Rio and into her kitchen, preparing dinner. “You like Thai curry, right?” A split-second later, she answered herself. “Nevermind, you’ll starve if you don’t like a good curry.” </p><p>	“I’m not an insane person,” Rio quipped. </p><p>	They ate on the couch, next to each other, watching <em>Kitchen Nightmares</em>. The curry was delicious, complex, and spicy; an apt reflection of Agatha. </p><p>The juxtaposition of watching peoples’ livelihoods crumble and Gordon Ramsay dragging his fingers through the sludge in their walk-in fridges should’ve been enough to turn Rio’s stomach while she was eating, but internally, she was cartwheeling. </p><p>	Rio mulled over what Agatha had said the week before, never truly letting the silt of the turmoil inside her head settle.</p><p>But here Agatha was, acting like she wanted <em>more</em>, giving Rio <em>more</em>. Rio was uncertain if <em>that </em>was truly what this meant, or if it was a kind gesture.</p><p>	One thing she was certain of, though: Agatha cared about her. Deeply. </p><p>	Her fall had jolted Agatha out of her distance and reticence, right into her house. This was a different side of Agatha that Rio somehow knew existed, layers deep, long before it’d revealed itself. Certainly, it wasn’t necessarily apparently when they’d first met, but it was something she said with her eyes.</p><p>Nevertheless, Rio didn’t disturb the perfectly still surface of the lake between them with questions. Sometimes, it was better to live in the present, even if it was fluid and shapeless.</p><p>	After dinner, Agatha cleaned up and settled back onto the couch. She swaggered through Rio’s house with a confidence that was suggestive of someone who was at the very least, a good friend. </p><p>	Rio was hyperaware of where she sat—close to Agatha, separated by a foot. She let herself indulge, and <em>wished </em>that Agatha was even closer. She wanted to bury her nose in her hair and ask for more. But the still water compelled her to resist.</p><p>	“God, I hate this guy,” Agatha said, gnawing on the hook of her index finger. This episode, like many, followed a stubborn patriarch losing his mind running an Italian restaurant that used powdered cheese. “Half of these restaurants have to be mob fronts.”</p><p>	“I think you might be onto something,” Rio replied.”On our day trips to Chicago, Evet—I went to this restaurant that I’m sure was a mob front.” She’d never said Evette’s name, and she hoped Agatha didn’t catch it. She told Agatha about the English pub she’d ventured to, and how she’d ordered the fish and chips, which turned out to be a frozen fish filet with giant, barely cooked potato wedges. “And it was expensive.”</p><p>	“How do you know it wasn’t just a bad restaurant?” Agatha asked.</p><p>	“Everyone in there wore thousand dollar suits and they only ordered drinks and oysters. And oysters weren’t on the menu.”</p><p>	Agatha nodded in agreement, accepting the rationale. “Did you go there with your ex?”</p><p>	“What?” Rio glanced skeptically at her, furrowing her brow down. </p><p>Agatha’s gaze honed in. “You started to say her name.”</p><p>Rio relented. “Her name is Evette, but I didn't think it was relevant.” </p><p>	“Evette,” Agatha repeated. “What a <em>quirky</em> name. Is she a sidekick in a rom-com?”</p><p>	Rio scoffed.</p><p>“You know, you never answered my question about why you moved here,” Agatha said, pursing her lips with purpose. “You said you wanted to be unknown, ‘even to yourself.’ What’d you mean by that?”</p><p>Her eyes fluttering, Rio asked how she remembered her exact words. It’s as if Agatha absorbed those words and held them close to her chest with the gentlest grip all this time, lying in wait. </p><p>“The more you try to hide something, the more people pry,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Profound,” Rio.</p><p>“Something must’ve happened for you to move here,” Agatha, with her proverbial crowbar, working it under the edge of Rio’s past. “What did she do to you?” Her lips remained parted, the question suspended between her teeth. </p><p>The question hit Rio like a demolition ball, straight in the gut. She scrambled around in her brain for the answer—but the shame crashed onto her, crushing her soul under its steel-toed boot, depriving her the ability to speak. </p><p>Words would not find their way out of Rio’s mouth, stuck in her throat. A kaleidoscope of emotions pierced her—anguish, panic, sorrow, grief—all at once. Her past and present had finally collided. It snuck up on her this time. </p><p>Rio clenched her stomach, braced for the impact of her own actions. </p><p>“I…” She sighed from her shoulders and into the depths of her feet.</p><p>She hadn’t told anyone in Westview, in her new life, what <em>she’d done to Evette</em> and how it had defined her after she’d done it. And how she’d deserved every ounce of misery, every sleepless night, and every misfortune that crossed her path. Had she truly reckoned with what she’d done to Evette? That she’d done it for a moment of refuge from their relationship, in the arms of some stranger?</p><p>Agatha paused the television and her gaze hung onto Rio. </p><p>“I cheated.”</p><p>Limbs tingling with anxiety and guilt, Rio’s palms broke out in a sweat. </p><p>Her heart lurched in her throat. Her vision tunneled, converging into a claustrophobic nightmare. There it was: the plain, prosaic truth. </p><p>There were no two ways about it, and Rio knew it. She could recount the ways that their relationship fragmented and disintegrated over the years in small ways—Evette was always early and Rio was always on time—in foundational ways–Rio was a fervent romantic, and Evette was decidedly reserved, and cold. </p><p>But Rio would not lay this on Agatha. That was just a way to assuage her own guilt. </p><p>At first, Agatha didn’t say anything. But then, she finally said, “That’s not so bad. But why did you do it?”</p><p>Had Rio fucked everything up with Agatha? Was <em>this </em>the truth that would change the trajectory of their happy medium? </p><p>This pattern seemed to stalk her throughout her life, where the dust would settle and then Rio would thrash and kick up a storm, incapable of letting things lie. </p><p>“Evette and I were together for ten years.” Her breaths chased the tails of one another, becoming shallow. “And I wasn’t happy for a long, long time. So, I went out one night and went home with a stranger,” Rio confessed, at last. A weight disintegrated from her shoulders, but the shame and self-hatred still remained. </p><p>“Why weren’t you happy with her?”</p><p>Rio cracked the joints in her fingers. That question was one that had hobbled her for years. She could never articulate exactly what or when it became clear that she was not in love with Evette. “She never looked at me when she said she loved me.”</p><p>“Even in the beginning, there was this gulf between us. She always said she knew me to my core, but I don’t think it was ever true. She was withholding and her affection was synthetic, like an act. I think she knew I wasn’t happy, but we were both too complacent. I was scared to be alone, and I thought our relationship was as close to that everlasting love everyone talks about as I could get.”</p><p>Once again, Agatha didn’t know what to say. </p><p>Rio waited, teetering on the unwieldy silence, trying to decode her eyes. “I thought it was the way things were supposed to be.”</p><p>“How did she find out?”</p><p>Tears welled up in Rio’s throat, but she swallowed them. She recoiled at her emotions. “I was such a coward that I didn’t tell her. Evette knew the moment I walked through the door. And <em>I was the one who left</em>.” </p><p>“Was it just the one time?” Agatha shifted back, putting distance between them. </p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, her soul fully exposed now. </p><p>“I thought you did something much worse,” Agatha teased, antsy and fidgeting with her hair. </p><p>Unreadable, Agatha ended the night there, excusing herself to go feed Señor Scratchy. She was so blasé and suddenly out of reach that Rio couldn’t tell if she was revolted or somber.</p><p>An anchor hung on Rio’s heart and gutted her. Through the sadness that lugged in her stomach, she uttered good night and a thank you. </p><p>In the doorway, Agatha turned around and said, “I think I could trust you, someday soon.” She said good night, like she always did, ending conversations at their precipices.</p><p>And then the strangest thing happened. It’s as if her presence coaxed out the truth and compelled Rio to unravel her deepest, most human thoughts. </p><p>From the nadir of her soul, Rio uttered, “Am I a wretched person if I say that I felt <em>liberated </em>when she cried as I packed my things and left?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her with an earnestness, and an openness. </p><p>	“Am I a bad person?” Rio asked. </p><p>Agatha kissed her then and there, passionately and genuinely, taking Rio delicately by the cheek. Rio kissed her back, spellbound, her heart skipping across her chest. </p><p>Agatha’s tongue begged for more, caressing Rio’s, deepening the kiss. She tilted her head, inhaling, her hips pushing Rio back against the doorframe. Her mouth searched for Rio’s truest passion and her left hand found her hip.</p><p><em>This </em>was what Rio had waited for her entire life. <em>This </em>was the revelation of her rawest desires. </p><p>Rio reciprocated, burying her fingers in Agatha’s hair, her thumb brushing her cheekbone. A fire originated from her belly and lashed ablaze to the pulse between her legs. Now, Rio was hungry for her. She was ready for her. </p><p>“I’m—” Without warning, Agatha broke from the kiss. “Sorry. I’m sorry. Good night.”</p><p>Barely registering the chilling night breeze whooshing towards her, Rio opened her eyes, her hand in the air, as if she was still holding onto Agatha. </p><p>Rio was categorically confused, aroused, and defenseless.</p><p>“Fuck.” </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio did not sleep last night. The equilibrium she’d grown used to for all of two days had been jostled and turned upside down and heaved aside. </p><p>	When she closed her eyes, she could <em>feel</em> Agatha’s lips on hers, she could hear the crackle of the fireworks, she could taste her tongue. And then she was gone again, like a ghost, an obvious and emerging pattern Rio could hardly stomach. Dissipating into the night like a goddamn spectre. </p><p>	All Rio could think about was her. Vacillating between being arousal, angry, and absolutely lost, Rio’s soul split off in different directions, in shreds. What kind of woman planted a searing kiss to end all kisses and then <em>apologized </em>and <em>walked away</em>? How the hell were they here again?</p><p>	Rio was exhausted with these stupid little games. She was angry at herself for playing along for a scrap of reciprocation. This was futile and pathetic.</p><p>	Yet, most of the day she couldn’t find the strength to confront Agatha, in any way. She was too scattered to call her and too angry to text. </p><p>She passed the time by watering the plants around the house, reorganizing her pantry, and watching reruns of bland and mildly offensive shows from the mid-aughts.</p><p>She should’ve spent more of the day resting, but Rio was brimming with energy, buzzing from her core to her fingertips and toes, with pins and needles. In theory, she would’ve hauled her ass up and stomped to Agatha’s house, uninhibited and lucid. But in practice, after she reorganized the pantry, she laid on her side until the sun set, her head pounding with pain, her eyelids flickering with dizzying stars.</p><p>	She half-expected Agatha to arrive at the door tonight, perhaps to kiss her wildly and then leave, just for the ritual of it all. Rio rolled her eyes scornfully.</p><p>It was 6 PM, and then 7 PM. And then another hour passed, at which point Rio slogged to the kitchen and muscled through a late dinner. She wasn’t hungry for food, so she settled for frozen potstickers and ate them without utensils.</p><p>	She surrendered to the living room floor, laying on her back and rolling from side to side, stretching her hips. And then she picked up her phone and called Agatha, finding strength and focus. </p><p>	The line rang and rang and rang. Rio was unsurprised. She stayed on until she heard the beep for the voicemail. </p><p>	“Agatha,” Rio said into the phone, breathing into her name. The silence on the other end detonated a cyclone of hubris in her. “What the hell is your problem? I know you’re listening. So, pick up. Stop running from me, goddamn it.”</p><p>At this point, it was too late to stop there. “You can’t kiss me like that—and then do that thing you do. You get spooked and you run, and I’m here. I’m ready for you. I’m fucking waiting for you.”</p><p>When she realized she’d run out of steam, she stuck her tongue out of the corner of her mouth, unsure if that dense weight in her stomach was regret or nausea. Her thumb slammed down on the red button to hang up. She laid her head down on the living room floor.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio woke up hours later, her neck brittle as the frigid midnight air. She found herself on the living room floor, right where’d left herself. Her stiff joints reminded her that she was acting ridiculously. What lured her out of sleep was the pitter-patter of the rain, soothing and rhythmic on the roof. </p><p>	Like a spectre herself, Rio threw on a light raincoat over her tank and sweatpants and went outside, climbing up her ladder for the first time since her accident. This was stupid and dangerous.</p><p>She had a nagging scratch in the back of her skull. She knew what she’d see when she looked out from her roof. </p><p>Rio shivered, the rain blanching her with cold. She peered in Agatha’s yard.</p><p>There she was, as if she’d been there forever, like a hundred-year-old willow tree. </p><p>Standing there, asleep, arms at her sides, getting soaked as the rain picked up to a rapturous rattle. </p><p>Without deliberation, Rio climbed down the ladder and rushed to Agatha’s house, past the front door, and straight down the stone path to the backyard. She’d never crossed the threshold into the field.</p><p>But as the rain fell upon her and glacial air bled under her skin, branching into her veins, </p><p>she tore through the field at a determined pace. Swaths and swaths of orange, yellow, and purple wildflowers towered over Rio and their brambly stalks and arms nicked her on her palms, flinging water droplets she made her way to Agatha. </p><p>	Suddenly, Rio came upon an opening where Agatha stood. This circular area was a patch of splintery yellowed grass, with a smattering of vibrant azaleas and yellow pearly everlastings spritzed in clusters. The rain had pummeled them into the ground, though, savagely and plainly. </p><p>Agatha’s boots pointed at a pile of stones, arranged neatly, with handfuls of dead flowers laying atop them. Water skimmed across the stones, and the moon shone in their glistening faces.</p><p>	Rio squeezed Agatha’s shoulder, and walked forward to look at her. To see her again after this decade of a day. </p><p>	The rain ran down Agatha’s expressionless face, from her hair to her forehead, and past her open, yet soulless blue eyes. She was still in what appeared to be her clothes from the day, a long blue coat with a white shirt and a pair of royal blue slacks. </p><p>Reaching for her hand, Rio pulled Agatha back from the stones, quivering in tandem. Agatha gave into Rio’s lead, her hand consciously accepting, but her mind paralyzed in sleep. Rio led her through the field, and into the house through the back door. </p><p>	Inside, Rio locked the back door and tugged Agatha’s boots off, of sound mind enough not to get her floors dirty with mud. She guided Agatha up the stairs, one step at a time, careful to make sure she didn’t trip. Rio steadied Agatha, holding onto her waist and elbow, leading her into the bedroom. </p><p>She laid Agatha down on the bed, simultaneously taking inventory of the room. The walls were black like night. A large framed beige tapestry of a waxing moon and constellations hung behind the bed and three long wooden shelves decorated with candles, creeping plants, black skulls, and gold accents hung on the opposite side. Residing in the remaining space on the wall were framed pieces of art. Among them: a snake print, a mossy flower painting, an unfinished sketch of a dark figure, and an old sepia-toned photograph of downtown Westview.</p><p>Rio slid open the door to the bathroom, and rummaged for a towel, raking through the drawers clumsily, barely focusing on any of Agatha’s personal things. </p><p>Her nail beds had turned purple and her fingers shook as she yanked open a larger drawer under the double-sink vanity. There, she found plush gray towels. She grabbed two, and heaved Agatha up to a sitting position to wrap her up. </p><p>	As she placed one edge of the towel over the other, Agatha’s hand seized Rio’s forearm violently. And she gasped back to wakefulness, her blue eyes bursting into flames, glaring dead at Rio. </p>

<p>For a minute, the universe atomized into an expanse of static, smothering Rio’s senses.  </p><p>	The flame in Agatha’s eyes transformed from abject terror to rage to delirium and finally metastasized into something else. Something between vulnerability and trust and surrender. </p><p> 	Rio’s heart jackhammered in her chest, threatening to crack her ribs, and blood rushed to her ears, deafeningly loud. It was as if a current had whipped through her nervous system, stunned her, and the sting reverberated.</p><p>	Rainwater dripped from Agatha’s nose and tiny beads of water formed on her brows and eyelashes. Her eyes never wavered from Rio’s. </p><p>“Wh-what happened?” Agatha asked, the purple leeching the color from her lips. “Wh-why are you h-here?” Her grip on Rio’s forearm loosened. </p><p>“You were slee-sleepwalking in the rain,” Rio answered, wrapping herself in a towel, staggering back to give her space. </p><p>Her teeth chattering and her voice hoarse, Agatha demanded, “Tell me what y-you s-saw. What d-did you s-s-see?”</p><p>“Agatha, I don’t c-care about that,” Rio said, with a razor embedded in her tone. “You’re freezing.”</p><p>They held onto their towels for a minute, warming up. </p><p>After a while, Agatha deliberated and seemed to trust Rio’s answer. She shrugged the towel off. She started to unbutton her shirt.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio watched in disbelief. “Oh, God. You’re hypothermic, you’re confused.” She unfurled the towel from her back and opened it to wrap it around Agatha.</p><p>“I’m not confused,” she countered. She looked at Rio, unmistakably and longingly. Rio’s chest heaved with suspense.</p><p>Agatha reached forward, her thumb caressing Rio’s cheek as she kissed her. She kissed her with a carnal urgency, as if this would be the last time. </p><p>Rio held onto Agatha’s wrist, giving into her spell, letting the magic cascade over her skin. Rio moaned, trembling and cold, but burning in her core. She tasted the sweetness inside Agatha’s mouth, their tongues dancing. </p><p>	“Rio, take me,” Agatha pleaded in her ear.</p><p>	“Are you sure?” Rio asked, her forehead pressed against Agatha’s. She could burst at the seams at any second now.</p><p>“I’m sure.”</p><p>Rio kissed her neck in response.</p><p>	“I want you now.” Agatha looked at Rio as she continued to undo her shirt, sliding one sleeve off at a time. The shirt plummeted to the ground, soaked. She undid her slacks, and hopped out of them. </p><p>They came together again in a fiery kiss, Rio taking Agatha by the waist with one hand and the other wandering down her lower back. Biting her bottom lip, Agatha pushed Rio’s jacket off her shoulders and lifted her tank top up and over her head. </p><p>	She placed her hand on Rio’s abdomen, her eyes bespoke with desire and admiration. “I’ve wanted you for a long time,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio drank the vision in: Agatha Harkness, stripped down to her bra and underwear. She turned toward the bed and unclasped her bra and flung it over her shoulder, and Rio came up behind her, clutching her breast with one hand and reading the shape of her hip with the other. </p><p>Then Rio turned Agatha around so that she was facing her. Her body was beautiful, wise, and experienced. Her nipples hardened as she stood, waiting, trembling. </p><p>“My God, you’re gorgeous,” Rio uttered. She let her pants fall to the floor and she advanced on Agatha, until the back of her knees bent at the edge of the bed and she fell back. </p><p>Rio felt the pooling warmth between her legs as Agatha took her by the hips, pulling her onto her body, claiming her. </p><p>Aching with anticipation, Rio peeled her underwear off. Their eyes remained locked on one another, pouring their honest inclinations through each other. </p><p>Rio took Agatha’s hands and pinned them above her head, siphoning her power back, kissing her neck and her collarbone. Agatha bit her bottom lip and inhaled shakily. “Don’t stop this time,” she said. “Please.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her breast, squeezing it as she kissed Agatha’s chest, sucking in her alabaster skin. She worked her way down to her belly, holding onto her hips, and looping a finger around her nude underwear. Her rain-stained skin chafed against Rio’s skin, calling and answering with hot friction.  </p><p>Tugging her underwear down, Rio nibbled on Agatha’s hip bones, and she moaned as she held onto Rio’s wrist. </p><p>With one swift movement, Rio spread Agatha’s bare legs, brushing her fingers against the tops of her thighs and then biting her inner thigh, breathless and hungry for her. Rio didn’t comprehend how much she wanted Agatha until this very moment, owning this slice of time and space for herself and for her frantic, mad desires.</p><p>Rio peppered kisses as close as she could to Agatha’s core, reducing her to a quietly quivering leaf as she teetered on the cliff of this line they were about to cross together. Their hands intertwined when Rio’s mouth finally made contact with the softest part of Agatha, her tongue speaking the language of her desire and passion. </p><p>Agatha threw her head back with a moan, her fingers tangled in Rio’s hair. </p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” she ached. </p><p>Rio came up for air, and relishing the pleasure upon her face and touched herself, working her fingers under the waistband of her underwear. She went back down on Agatha, pleasuring herself, kissing her inner thighs and licking up her wetness. Agatha thrusted against Rio’s mouth, unable to stop herself. She rode her tongue, uninhibited and frenzied, her hips rolling rhythmically. </p><p>With her free hand, Rio entered Agatha, working twice as hard.</p><p>“Don’t stop,” Agatha begged. “Oh, <em>God</em>.”</p><p>Rio slipped her fingers in and out herself with the same cadence that she pleasured Agatha, purposefully and skillfully. Her jaw tired, but she rallied every time Agatha’s grip in her hair tightened. It was as if she was holding back, edging close but unable to finish yet. Was she teasing Rio again? Was this another attempt to gain the upper hand?</p><p>“Keep going,” Agatha breathed. “Keep going, Rio. I’m close. But I—” Agatha moaned hard, her words stolen from her. “I’m…taking…Lexapro. It’s so hard for me to finish—”</p><p>Launching herself over Agatha, Rio wiped her mouth, revealing her surprised eyes. “Come again?”</p><p>“I have <em>not</em>. Don’t stop!” </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, her chest heaving, out of breath. She laid next to Agatha, her breasts pressed against her side, their rain-and-sweat-glistening skin communing. </p><p>Rio’s hand wandered back down, over Agatha’s belly and down to her flowery lips. She buried her head in Agatha’s shoulder, planting kisses there as she slid her fingers inside of her again. </p><p>Agatha turned towards Rio, as her fingers beckoned her, drawing her pleasure from her core. With her free hand, Agatha returned the favor, her resourceful fingers entering Rio, working quickly and rhythmically. She kissed Rio, desperately, the two of them exchanging breaths, their limbs intertwined, their sweat intermingling. </p><p>Rio could feel the Earth falling out from under her as Agatha’s blue eyes studied the strained passion upon her face. She seized a handful of the sheets, holding onto the last cord tethering her to this planet.</p><p>“Look at me,” Agatha said.</p><p>Lifting her head, Rio gazed at Agatha. A rush of exhilaration rose in Rio’s stomach, and she knew she’d die a little death soon enough. “Agatha, <em>oh</em>, I’m—”</p><p>Their bodies writhed against one another, fighting for pleasure, and Rio came. She saw the death of a star flash before her eyes and envelop her body, her cheeks sweltering.</p><p>She gave herself a brief respite, panting, before focusing all her energy on Agatha.</p><p>She stared deeply into Agatha’s eyes, fucking her until she shut her eyes, and grabbed Rio’s shoulder, her fingers prodding for her bones. </p><p>She moaned softly into Rio’s mouth with abandon, letting herself go, revealing her most elementary form. </p><p>Rio felt Agatha spasm around her fingers and her legs clamp down around her hand. Wetness had become them, and they’d become it.</p><p>They both went limp and laid entangled with one another, listening to the crickets sing and the owls howl. Their breathing crashed against each other, until it ebbed and flowed in unison. </p><p>Sighing, Rio’s eyes glazed over, a shimmer of ecstasy washing over her. She turned to Agatha, and the two peered at each other quietly. Rio drew her fingers across Agatha’s damp hair, tucking it behind her ear. </p><p>“I’ve thought about this for a long time,” Rio said, softly. “I dream of you.”</p><p>“It’s funny,” Agatha said, “I haven’t dreamt in years. Not until I started dreaming about you.” She smiled, her nose crinkling. </p><p>“What changed your mind?”</p><p>Agatha thought for a moment, before pecking Rio on the lips, affectionately. “I couldn’t fight myself anymore.”</p><p>Soon after, Agatha cuddled Rio, holding onto her waist and nuzzling into her back. </p><p>Now that she’d had a taste of Agatha Harkness and fulfilled her burgeoning desires—Rio was irrevocably consumed by her. Agatha could destroy her, and Rio would let her. </p><p>And she would keep coming back. </p>

<p>At dusk, the birds called to and answered each other, warbling and chirping. Heavy-footed squirrels scurried about and squeaked from the trees, readying themselves for an unseasonably late hibernation. The sun poured through the curtains, cutting a sharp line across the bottom half of Agatha’s bed. </p><p>Rio awoke on her belly, her bare ass facing up, facing the world. An arm hung over her hip, the fingers pointing down. Last night was not a magnificently earth-shattering, life-changing dream. It had really happened.</p><p>Agatha slept on Rio’s upper back, her cheek pressed against her. Rio had half-expected Agatha to shake her shoulder last night, and order her to go home. </p><p>Gently readjusting herself onto her back, Rio rubbed her eyes and blinked the sleep away. Agatha held onto her waist, and rested her head on Rio’s bare chest, stirring. </p><p>It was early enough that she had at least a couple of hours before she had to go to work. So much for the rest the doctor had ordered. But after last night, Rio felt as if she’d crawled inside an egg and emerged as a newer, different being. </p><p>This was everything. She stroked the tendrils of Agatha’s hair and tucked them behind her ear, taking in the faint scent of her sweat and the steady pulse of the vein in her neck. Now, Rio had set up shelter in uncharted territory, and she was finally letting herself fall. Whether Agatha caught her or not, Rio was in free fall. </p><p>She’d never expected that in less than a year after Evette—she was here, stricken with a newfound ardor for another person. An ardor that had taken over her bloodstream and transformed her. </p><p>She couldn’t fathom that the universe had somehow handed her what she’d been looking for her entire adult life. Something that couldn’t be fixed, built, or worked around. Something that Rio didn’t think she deserved.</p><p>Agatha inhaled, and squinted out of one eye, sleepily. Rio placed a hand on her back, the tips of her fingers tingled when they danced on the surface of Agatha’s soft skin.</p><p>“Hey, you,” Agatha said, her blue eyes lucid and alert now. </p><p>“Morning,” Rio said. “How’d you sleep?”</p><p>“You tell me,” Agatha said. “I should keep you around at night to hold onto me, so I don’t sleepwalk again.”</p><p>Rio <em>almost </em>told her that she, in fact, sleepwalked frequently. But some things were best unsaid. She vowed never to spy on Agatha again. </p><p>“You just want to save on your gas bill,” Rio quipped, burying the thought. “But, if you’re asking, I’m accepting.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her neck, gently handling Rio’s jaw. “I could eat.” It was all so natural between them. </p><p>She confidently kicked the covers off and climbed out of bed, naked. Rio smiled at her, biting her thumb to keep her wits about her, but still completely captivated by her sensuous, lithe curves. The way her long, unkempt morning hair spilled down her pale back, the shape of her hips, the nape of her neck bruised with hickeys. </p><p>She disappeared into her closet and tossed Rio a t-shirt. </p><p>“Just a t-shirt?” Rio asked, lifting the white t-shirt to her nose. There was a bottle of Sriracha printed on the front of it, and it stopped well above her knees when she threw it on. </p><p>Meanwhile, Agatha fastened a silky black floral robe around her waist. </p><p>Señor Scratchy greeted Rio as she followed Agatha down the stairs, meowing loudly at her as he sat gracefully on a step. She offered her hand, which he agreed to headbutt, lovingly.</p><p>In the kitchen, Rio worked around Agatha as if they’d rehearsed this stage play: she pulverized hipster coffee beans in a hand grinder and handily packed the grounds into the portafilter, pulling shots on a rumbling espresso machine at the counter while Agatha fried eggs in a pan. Then Rio whisked out two glasses, somehow guessing the right cabinet on the first try.</p><p>Two pieces of hearty, grainy toast jumped out of the toaster.</p><p>Agatha turned off the stove and buttered the toast with the flick of her wrist, spreading it evenly. Rio had finished pouring two iced coffees as Agatha laid the eggs to rest on the toast. She’d always liked iced coffee, and so she bestowed it on Agatha this morning. </p><p>At the dining room table, they sat next to each other, their elbows brushing up against each other. </p><p>“I can feel you staring,” Agatha said, chewing on her toast. “What?” </p><p>“So, do you remember when you said you ‘couldn’t give me more’?” The caffeine pervaded Rio’s bloodstream, as if a million tiny race cars suddenly blasted through the starting line of her heart. </p><p>Agatha turned to Rio and raised an eyebrow. “Oh.” </p><p>“No, no, do <em>not </em>say that,” Rio protested. “Not after last night. Can we just—” </p><p>She took a bite of toast and egg, haphazardly. </p><p>“—say what we are?” </p><p>“And what’s that?” Agatha drummed her fingers on the table and her nose turned up, kicking the question back. </p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at her, like the crosshairs of a gun. “What is it with you and the games? Do you hide behind them because you’re afraid to let someone care about you?” She didn’t mean for it to sound so accusatory and raw, but they were not bashful young adults. Rio had always had a knack for saying the most cutting things in the most mundane times.</p><p>Lost for words, Agatha dug in her heels. “What do you want me to say? That we’re <em>together</em>? That we’re fucking? That we’re tit-for-tat?” Her blue eyes gleamed mean, but Rio knew it was a defensive ruse.</p><p>“I care about you and I like you and I’m thinking about you all the time,” Rio said, softening. She took Agatha’s hand. “I just want to be with you.” </p><p>“You don’t know all of me,” Agatha said. “If you really knew me, would you still want to be with me?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio urged. “Give me the chance to know all of you. I want to know you.”</p><p>She gazed at Rio cautiously, before a gentle smile formed across her face. “I suppose I can bend a few rules for you.” Agatha downed the rest of her coffee. “So, I could say that we are <em>dating</em>. Satisfied?”</p><p>Rio held onto her hand, and it felt like she may never let go.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	After she’d left Agatha’s house, Rio went back to her house and wiggled into her uniform of choice, which signaled her soft-launch return to work: a black denim jumpsuit, washed gray at the knees and elbows, with her favorite blue corduroy cap. There was no work on the docket today, so she opted for a pair of sneakers. Then, she headed out. </p><p>The bell rang above Rio’s head as she swung open the front door at the hardware store. There was a bound in her step that the caffeine played no part in; it was new energy being synthesized from air. </p><p>	“Goooood morning,” Rio said, waving at Lilia with a toothy grin. What the hell was happening to her? </p><p>	Lilia wore her curly gray hair down, in an oversized maroon sweater that swallowed her frame. Behind her glasses, she cocked her head to the side and clicked her tongue. “Back at work already? Didn’t know you were a sucker for the boot.”</p><p>	Rio strolled up to the counter with the swagger of a vaquero who’d just walked away from a shootout. “<em>Dios</em>, Lilia. What’s up with you? Do you hate holiday cheer?”</p><p>	“A little bit, yes. Ugh, I’m sorry, I didn’t sleep well.” She handed off two crates of table saw blades to a fresh-faced employee, who struggled to carry them with his lanky arms. “But you clearly did.” A brow arched to the middle of her forehead. </p><p>	Rio didn’t budge. </p><p>	Lilia clipped her glasses in her hair. She tapped her pen against her lip and examined Rio, her eyes lasering in on her with burning precision. “You’re glowing. My God, are you pregnant?” </p><p>	“Okay, so you really didn’t sleep well,” Rio replied, shaking her head. “Look, I don’t have any jobs scheduled today, but I’m just here to pick up some stuff. Do you have diamond-tipped Forstner bits?” </p><p>	“We have carbide-tipped. Diamond’s on backorder,” Lilia informed. She spun her pen across her knuckles with impressive flair. “Oh, I know what’s got you in such a good mood. I know what you did.” </p><p>	Rio started to wonder if she wore her past on the outside, because Lilia could always read her. Still, she stood there at the counter, hands stuffed in her pockets, clutching her thighs. </p><p>	“You got <em>her</em> out of your system, didn’t you?” </p><p>	“Lilia, come on.”</p><p>	“You did, didn’t you?” </p><p>	“I cannot confirm or deny,” Rio answered. “Look, I’m not talking about her anymore. I’m not gonna fuel any of those rumors anymore.” </p><p>	Lilia sighed markedly and typed something into the computer at the register. “I still think she’s one scary bitch.”</p><p>“She’s not so scary.” </p><p>Without another beat, Rio rattled off the rest of her materials list, and then wandered off into the aisles, back to her routine.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	The rest of the day, Rio organized the hardware in her workbench, combing through each drawer and painstakingly sorting the mess of screws, nails, bolts, nuts and washers into their designated slots. In theory, she wanted to be a fastidious handywoman, but in reality, jobs were unpredictable sometimes, and she moved like lightning. And when lightning struck, things got messy.</p><p>	That night, Agatha invited herself over, and Rio invited her into her bedroom, which she’d never seen before. Of course, Rio had made the bed extra neat that morning and swept any evidence of her raccoon-like habits away. </p><p>	Between asking about her day and telling her she missed her, Rio stripped Agatha’s shirt off and kissed her neck, sucking in her skin between her teeth. She kissed her way down to her chest, clutching onto her lower back, pressing Agatha’s body against hers. </p><p>	With surprising strength, Agatha swung Rio around, tongue flirting with hers, and pushed her down onto the bed. </p><p>	There, Rio lay on her elbows, exposed, her body hard and sculpted. She smirked at Agatha, looming over her, taking off her pants.</p><p>	She climbed over Rio, nibbling on her ear as she teased her, sending a roar of flames down her spine, her fingers brushing the tendons of her inner thigh. And then her fingers grazed over Rio’s desire, wet and ready. Rio held onto Agatha’s breast, using her thumb and index finger to tease her beautiful, pink nipples. </p><p>Before long, Agatha had reduced Rio to recklessness. </p><p>She grabbed her hand and placed her fingers over Agatha’s, rolling her hips until her fingers slid inside of her.</p><p>	“<em>Jesus</em>, Agatha,” Rio whispered. </p><p>	 Agatha’s mouth was hot and wet on Rio’s, swallowing her pleasure as she thrust her hand fluidly into her, relentlessly scaling mountains together, reaching the climax in a series of broken moans and cries.</p><p>The next week continued on like this, one unending stream of their bodies intertwining, slick with sweat, their hearts mirroring one another, and their hands connecting. 	</p><p>	Each day after work, either Rio barged through Agatha’s front door or Agatha through Rio’s. Dirty and spent from the day, Rio would stumble into Agatha’s arms, and she’d ogle her.</p><p>	“I didn’t think coveralls would do it for me, but you’re so fucking hot like this,” she would say, already peeling off Rio’s clothes, flinging her cap off. </p><p>	For Rio, it was Agatha’s hair and the primal, evil look in her eye that drove her mad. The woman may have been hated in Westview, but it certainly wasn’t for her painfully striking beauty. Rio’s knees buckled at the sight of her razor sharp jawline up close, Agatha wandering up, between her legs. </p><p>Each night, they got to know each other, learning the language of their tongues and their bodies, hands fisting the sheets, headboards knocking against the wall, legs tangled. They took turns working on one another passionately, savagely, delicately, and longingly. </p><p>Rio found the most joy in drawing the pleasure from Agatha, strapped with an extension of herself, slowly pushing every inch inside of her, fucking her deeply, holding onto her hips.</p><p>Agatha seemed to enjoy how hard Rio worked for her, surrendering herself again and again. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	Rio rose before Agatha this morning, before the sun rose, and prepared breakfast. She whipped up pancakes with matcha lattes, bouncing around her kitchen as quietly as she could. Though, she got the feeling Agatha could sleep through anything. By the time she wandered into the kitchen, her witchy hair tousled and sexy, Rio was reading the news on her phone and halfway through her pancakes. </p><p>	Wearing Rio’s Chicago Bulls sweatshirt, Agatha served herself a plate of pancakes and took her latte to the table. She sat with one knee pulled to her chest. </p><p>	Every morning that they’d had breakfast together, Rio had to pinch herself. Witnessing Agatha Harkness in her most comfortable, unguarded state—it was surreal. This was a goddamn dream.</p><p>	Sipping her matcha, Agatha’s face twisted into a sour expression. “What is this? Dirt water?”</p><p>	Rio snickered. “How did you make this far in your life without trying matcha? By the way, this is the <em>good </em>shit. It’s a ceremonial blend, and I hand-whisked it,” she said, gesturing with her mug. “With my dominant hand.” </p><p>	Agatha pointed a keen look at her. “Ah, so it’s ceremonial dirt, then?” She took Rio’s hand and kissed it with flair only she could possess without being corny. And people said chivalry was dead.	</p><p>	She observed the growing number of plants in Rio’s dining room. “I didn’t know you had such a green thumb.”</p><p>	Rio shrugged. “I don’t know if I have a green thumb. I just kinda collect plants, even if I don’t want them. Some die and some thrive, but in the end, I keep collecting plants.” She used her fork to cut a piece of the pancake on her plate into a smaller morsel. “You got any gardening plans for the spring?”</p><p>	The air in the dining room seemed to switch directions, and Agatha stiffened. She cleared her throat. “No. Since Nicky passed, I haven’t wanted to plant anything or nurture anything.”</p><p>	“Did you have a garden before?” Rio asked.</p><p>	“No,” she said, shaking her head, her eyes downcast.</p><p>	“Maybe we could—”</p><p>	“Listen, I like the wildflowers as they are. Can we talk about something else?” </p><p>	Rio left it at that, pivoting to the day ahead of her, all the while burrowing into her shell. It was that funny feeling that left her reeling when Agatha retreated, with no warning. Things were different between them now, but a shimmering, refractive membrane still separated them by sheer millimeters. Agatha was still hiding behind it, and Rio was afraid she’d tear a hairline crack in it if she prodded.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	It was the day before Christmas Eve, and Rio packed her morning with a handful of random jobs. Drywall patches, last minute Christmas lights, and fireplace cleaning. She had a long lunch at Hudson Diner. In Westview, her money stretched much further, and she lived like a half-disgraced king, so she could afford to take on less, especially around the holidays.</p><p>	She chose a booth by the window, entirely surrounded by holiday festivities and decorations. A ten-foot Christmas tree towered at the front of the diner, its limbs bending at the weight of all the funky ornaments hanging onto them. There were dinosaurs, old tin trucks, indiscriminate old photos of unflattering yearbook photos, dreidels, and bao amongst them. In the rest of the diner, soft yellow icicle lights lined the ceiling, alongside gigantic gold, red, and green jingle bells. It was overstimulating. </p><p>	Rio ordered biscuits and gravy with a small cup of black coffee and a side of green beans. </p><p>Mouth stuffed and reading on her phone, a hand appeared in front of Rio, rapping against the surface of the white table. </p><p>	“Haven’t seen you around for a while, Vidal.” </p><p>	Alice stood at her table, arms crossed in a red leather jacket. Her shoulders were square, and her posture was stiff. </p><p>	“Hey,” Rio mustered. </p><p>	Alice slid into the booth, across from her, demanding her attention. “I’ve started an unofficial investigation into Agatha’s son—”</p><p>	“Why?” Rio snapped. “There’s nothing to look into. I thought we’d all agreed that it was <em>wrong</em>, what we were doing. It was <em>wrong</em>, what you were asking me to do.”</p><p>	“I didn’t agree to stop,” Alice rejoined. “Look, I don’t care if you’re sleeping with her or if she softened you up—whatever the hell it is you’re doing now—I was coming here as a courtesy.” </p><p>	Rio glared at her, their friendship suddenly siphoned into an abyss, flashing before her eyes. </p><p>	“I’ve asked the Westview court to pull any records they can find on her son, and I’m waiting on the results.” Alice swallowed, and her eyes drilled holes in Rio’s head, as grave as the green sky before a tornado. “If you know anything, you’d better say so now.” </p><p>	“I don’t.” Rio’s nostrils flared, and rage captured her entire being. Her hand curled into a fist on the table.</p><p>	“Look, Rio, don’t be naïve. I’m a cop,” Alice said. “It’s my fucking job to investigate things like this.” </p><p>	“Alice, <em>don’t </em>do this. There’s no basis for this.” Rio looked over her shoulder to see if any of the other diners were listening. The clink and clatter of dishes and silverware continued around the booth. </p><p>	“<em>You </em>were the one who told me about her son.”</p><p>“And <em>you </em>were the one who coerced me into being your informant,” Rio hissed. “You don’t come out of this looking clean, either.” </p><p>“It’s suspicious that there’s no record of him in Westview. It’s suspicious that she never told anyone.”</p><p>	“So, she was grieving then. Is it a crime to grieve?” Rio pleaded. “If our friendship ever meant anything to you, you’ll drop this. If you’re still a person behind that badge, you’ll stop coming after her.” </p><p>	For a moment, Alice didn’t say anything, considering carefully. </p><p>	Then, she asked, “Why are you so hellbent on defending Agatha Harkness? Did something happen between you two?”</p><p>	This could’ve been the time that Rio conceded and told Alice that she was dating Agatha, but instead, she lied. She couldn’t read Alice’s reaction, a mix of scrutiny and confusion, but she knew she couldn’t trust her now. </p><p>With two fingers, Alice reached into her jacket and placed two bills on the table. “If those records come back, and I find no reason for suspicion, I will drop the case.”</p>

<p>After work, Rio dragged her evening out, first stopping for gas at a station in the opposite direction of home. She made conversation with the cashier, which was intensely out of character for her. Anything to stifle the all-consuming panic that was blurring the edges of her vision, threatening to bury her. </p><p>	Naïvely, she ran through the options.</p><p>	She could keep this secret from Agatha and <em>hope to God</em> Alice didn’t find anything, and that she’d never have to reveal their ill-conceived arrangement. But Rio <em>knew </em>it was wrong. She was banking on the chance that Alice wouldn’t find anything, spinelessly allowing herself to lie to Agatha, again, continuing the vicious cycle.</p><p>	At the gas station, Rio bought a pack of American Spirits and drove to Jen’s bar. She paced around outside, lighting a cigarette, and then sucked it down like it would disintegrate into ash at any second. </p><p>	“Goddamn it,” she hissed, to herself. She wished, stupidly, that she could turn back time and slap herself out of her intrusive curiosity for Agatha. </p><p><em>Why </em>did she climb on that fucking ladder? Night after night. <em>Why </em>did she tell Alice about Agatha’s son? That was never her story to tell. She’d blurted it out, selfishly, attempting to stow herself behind someone else’s grief. </p><p>	Rio put the cigarette out and flicked it into the concrete ashtray in front of the bar. She went in and grabbed a seat at the bar, racing another patron there. He was an older, tan-skinned man with a stretchy frown. She didn’t care that it was rude. </p><p>	Jen zoomed behind the bar alongside two other bartenders, popping limes into drinks and pouring tonics with that up-high finesse the liquor license seemed to require. She said hi to Rio and tossed her a coaster. </p><p>“Haven’t seen you in a hot minute. What do you want?”</p><p>	“Just give me your bottom shelf vodka,” Rio groaned.</p><p>	Jen halted mid-step and turned around, resting a bottle of gin on her hip. “You fucking hate vodka. Are you okay?”</p><p>	As she approached, she squinted and read the stress on Rio’s forehead. “Okay, what happened? You smell like my grandpa. I didn’t know you smoked.” </p><p>	Rio didn’t deny it, even though she wasn’t a regular smoker. “Please, Jen. I need jet fuel.” </p><p>	Jen ducked down and disappeared under the counter, and then appeared with a small plastic flask in hand, with no label. “This is basically rubbing alcohol.” She poured the clear liquid into a tumbler. “Enjoy.” </p><p>	Rio had come all the way here to see a familiar face, but she couldn’t possibly tell Jen what was going through her mind. If she told Jen, would it spread like wildfire, all the way back to Lilia and Alice? Could she trust Jen?</p><p>	“So, tell me what’s going on, because you’re stinking up the place with very heavy vibes.” </p><p>	Rio took a swig of her vodka, knives stabbing up her nostrils, and her throat burned. “I’m just having a shitty day.” </p><p>	Jen leaned over the counter on her elbows, resting her head in her hands. She gave Rio an unrushed, understanding squeeze on her forearm. “I know that’s not it, but I’m not going to pressure you into telling me whatever it is,” she said. “But I want you to know I’m here, if you ever want to talk.” </p><p>	It brought Rio an inch of solace, even though she wasn’t sure who her friends were now. Instinctually, she felt she could trust Jen, though. </p><p>	“Boo!” Hot air puffed on Rio’s neck and she leapt from her seat, making a ruckus. The patrons behind her stared with wide, unwavering eyes. </p><p>	“Jesus, Billy,” Rio said. She gathered herself and gaped at him. </p><p>He took the seat next to her and waved at Jen. “Can I get something fruity?”</p><p>	Dead-eyed, Jen retorted, “You can get your ass back here if you want a drink.” She dove back into the commotion of the bar, greeting the patrons at the opposite end. </p><p>	“I’m not on the schedule tonight,” Billy called after her. He turned back to Rio and gave her a knowing, smug look. </p><p>	“What?” Rio asked.</p><p>	He elbowed her and took a sip of her drink. “<em>Blech</em>, what is <em>that</em>? I meant for that to be cool—” He spat out a mist of vodka. “Why are you drinking this?”</p><p>	“Long day,” Rio said, curtly. </p><p>	“Anyway, I know you’re slipping it to Aunty Agatha.” His face scrunched up and he cringed. “I don’t know why I said that. But you heard me.” </p><p>	“Where are your parents?” Rio rolled her eyes at him, but on the inside, her heart sped up like a hamster. </p><p>	“Don’t,” he yawned. “You’re wearing her custom-made Westview Wiccans sweatshirt.”</p><p>	Rio peered down at the tan sweatshirt with nondescript collegiate white letters. </p><p>	“The Wiccan colors are gold and this hideous Windows blue. She wore that shirt when she babysat me and Tommy.” </p><p>	She closed her eyes and rubbed the bridge of her nose with a sense of acceptance. Her reaction was a definitive confirmation. “Please keep it to yourself, okay?” </p><p>	He patted her forearm. “Don’t sweat it. Your secret’s safe with me.”</p><p>	Then, against her judgment, she spilled the truth to Billy. She’d been simmering for too long, and now her conscience and rational thought brimmed over the edges of her psyche. She needed someone to hang onto while she overlooked the impasse she was about to break through, head-on. </p><p>	“I don’t know what to do,” Rio croaked. “I can’t lose her, not <em>so soon</em>.”</p><p>	“Well, what if Alice doesn’t find anything? You don’t tell her, and there’s no harm, right?”</p><p>	Rio pondered that path once again. Its siren song seduced her, lulling her into complacence. She could keep her dirty secret to herself, gambling her relationship on whether Alice could find anything. The thing was, Rio didn’t even know what resided in those files about Agatha’s son, or about her. But she didn’t care. In her bones, she knew that whatever it was, she would choose to be with Agatha. She would choose to fall back into her embrace. </p><p>	“And if she does find something?” Rio asked.</p><p>	“Agatha will know it was you when Alice comes knocking.” Billy sighed, his eyeliner making his dark eyes look more austere in this dim lighting. “It’s ultimately up to you. But for what it’s worth, I think you care too much about her to continue lying.” </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio raced home and arrived at Agatha’s front door, knocking on the door, which felt like a formality at this point. But it was late, and she’d not texted Agatha all day, ignoring her messages.</p><p>	Agatha opened the door with a devastatingly bright smile; it was one of those rare, true smiles that Rio had only gotten to know recently. “I thought you weren’t gonna make it.” </p><p>	She kissed Rio, holding her face, her lips soft and sweet. Rio kissed her back, taking a step forward and closing the door behind her. She held Agatha from the small of her back, pulling her close, taking her in as if it were the last time. It may very well be the last time. </p><p>	Responding with her body, Agatha pressed her hips against Rio. </p><p>	“Agatha,” Rio said, imploding immediately, forcing herself to break away. “Wait.” Her nose involuntarily sunk, her eyes already tearful. </p><p>	She staggered back from Agatha, unhanding her, creating an ocean of distance between them. She’d run out of time. </p><p>	Rio faced Agatha and confessed. “The Westview Police have opened up an unofficial investigation into what happened to Nicky. And I’m the reason why they’ve started looking.” </p><p>	It’s as if the air was suddenly sucked out of the room, the sounds of the night critters flattened into the silence of the truth, the warmth of Agatha’s touch turned brittle and cold, and the delicate balance between them snapped.</p><p>	Agatha’s eyes transformed from a placid blue to a glacial, penetrating blue. Her lip curled and trembled with rage and utter betrayal. “<em>You went to the cops? You told them?</em>”</p><p>	“I fucked up. I slipped up and told Alice Wu-Gulliver.”</p><p>	Agatha vibrated with a cold, cruel wrath, not saying a word, not shifting eye contact. </p><p>	“If she doesn’t find anything—”</p><p>	“How long have you been talking to her?”</p><p>	“I haven’t been t—”</p><p>	“<em>How fucking long, Rio</em>?” Her voice struck like a bullet through glass. </p><p>	“I met her in October,” Rio admitted. She frantically clung onto the quickly sinking ship she was on. Her stomach cramped and twisted with regret. “But I won’t let her take you. I don’t know what happened back then, but I know you did it for—”</p><p>	Agatha cut her off again, her eyes gleaming with recognition, darting back and forth. “So those pigs sent you. They sent you to watch me, and the coward that you are—you, what? You folded instantly? Did they offer you money?”</p><p>	Rio shook her head and protested, her voice extinguished to a whisper. The bile climbed up her throat.</p><p>	“That’s how you knew I was outside that night in the rain,” Agatha seethed. “<em>You were watching me</em>.” </p><p>	“I’m so sorry, Agatha. I’m just so sorry,” Rio said. The words vanished into the air like smoke, futile and meaningless. “I never meant to go through with any of it.” All of it sounded so profoundly foolish. Everything had become crystal clear in hindsight. </p><p>How could she ever be forgiven? Could she ever be forgiven?</p><p>	“Oh, you didn’t <em>mean </em>to? The hell you didn’t,” Agatha hissed. “You’ve been lying to me this entire time.”</p><p>“You’re right about one thing, Rio. You <em>are </em>a coward.”</p><p>Rio let the gashes of her psyche bleed, speechless, defeated, and broken. Her tongue was bound by the cuttingly true words Agatha had doled out. She could see Rio down to her core, down to the barren sum of who she was: a two-faced coward. 	</p><p>	“And to think I was—I can’t believe I thought you were going to be different,” she scoffed. </p><p>Rio caught a look in Agatha’s eyes. A look that annihilated any semblance of hope and resilience in Rio’s heart. Devastation ravaged through her chest, knowing and <em>recognizing </em>the desolation in Agatha. That she couldn’t hide it. That she’d been betrayed by someone yet again.</p><p>“I am different, I promise you,” Rio uttered, fighting against her shame. “I will not let anything happen to you. Agatha, I—”</p><p>“I never should’ve trusted you,” she said, her voice dripping with low vitriol. “Just—get the hell out.”</p><p>Her eyes shot hooks out to Rio’s, tying her down for a hollow second, just before she brought down the hatchet. </p><p>“Never show your face to me again.”</p>

<p>For the first day, Rio respected Agatha’s wishes. It was an icy, gray Christmas Eve, void of verve and mirth. The barren, brown trees stood along the sidewalks, clumped together yet still unbearably lonely. Their branches attempted to reach out, but drooped towards the yellowed grass. </p><p>She did not end up at Agatha’s front door, pathetically begging for forgiveness. Instead, she drank herself to sleep in between frenzied bouts of sickness and weeping. A playlist of holiday classics played on a hellish loop, where some songs played louder and harsher than others. </p><p>When she was not tearful or crying, Rio was numb and detached. She did not sleep for more than an hour at a time, her righteous guilt jolting her from any respite. </p><p>	On Christmas Day, Rio woke at dawn, encased in a layer of cold sweat. This was not how she’d imagined she would be spending Christmas. She was abjectly alone, the color in her world had drained away, leaving only remnants of black and gray.</p><p>And the worst part was that she deserved it. The weight of the sky had come crashing down, crushing Rio, flattening her to a crumple of flesh, bone, and cartilage. She stayed there, razed and destroyed. </p><p>In the afternoon, she dragged herself out of bed and left a wrapped present in Agatha’s mailbox, along with an apology card. It was a wooden cuckoo clock from a local vendor weeks ago, which Agatha had mentioned would complete her dining room. It felt pathetic, but Rio wanted her to have the gift. </p><p>The next day, the card had been returned to Rio’s mailbox. A flicker of hope glinted in Rio’s heart, knowing that Agatha had taken the clock, but then again, she was an opportunist. She wasn’t the type of woman to give up a good gift for the principle of it. The card was unopened, too, which doused the optimism further.</p><p>Days passed, melding together, and Rio took on odd jobs for sad, desperate people to keep her sad, desperate self busy. To keep her tormented mind company.</p><p> As much as she wanted to assuage her own guilt and reach out, Rio steeled herself and gave Agatha peace. It was the least she deserved. </p><p>Rio toed the line between respecting her wishes and pushing through her fortress to beg for forgiveness. She would apologize and repent every day for the rest of her life if it meant she could see Agatha again, even if the gaze she bestowed upon her was full of hatred and disgust. She’d bound herself to Agatha’s grief, attempting to take upon herself so she wouldn’t have to shoulder the burden by herself, even if had severed ties.</p><p>Rio spent a day at a curmudgeonly old man’s house, drying and draining the flooded crawl space beneath it. </p><p>He’d neglected to get the gutters cleaned that year and after the rainfall, the crawl space was in dire straits. With a mask and a headlight on, she was crouched over, siphoning water out of the space with a vacuum, the air thick with mildew and the ground spongy and muddy. </p><p>She dedicated the first half of the day to drying the space, only coming up for air when she couldn’t take it any longer, breathing in recycled air through her mask.</p><p>Occasionally, the old codger would wander down to the basement and shout for Rio, badgering her for her status. </p><p>“How long do you think you’ll be?”</p><p>“Can you finish the job today?”</p><p>“Hold on, Mr. Hellman, I can’t hear you over the dehumidifier,” Rio would say, sighing into her mask. </p><p>Then he’d ask a series of questions that were born out of anxiety or impatience, or both. “Can you install the pump today? You think my quote will change? Is there mold damage?”</p><p>“If it dries up enough. Your quote shouldn’t change, unless I find something else. The mold test came up negative.” Rio would field his questions until he was bored, and then he’d disappear upstairs again. </p><p>She worked through lunch; hunger never crept up on her. By the early evening, she’d dug a hole in the crawlspace and installed a sump pump, pulling something in her lower back in the process. </p><p>When she climbed out of hell and back onto the basement floor, the man was sitting at his dining room table with a pair of thick glasses on, scrubbing the surface of a shotgun with a wooden brush. </p><p>“Took you long enough,” he grouched.</p><p>Rio explained to him the work she did and then sent him a quote, all the while he didn’t look up from his shotgun. He wiped down the breech end of the double barrel and then ran a brush through it. </p><p>“Listen, I’ll be honest. I don’t have the money for you today,” Hellman said, his gravelly voice eerily even. </p><p>An uneasy rumble formed in Rio’s stomach and she glanced up from the quote. It wasn’t unusual for clients to hesitate; however, they usually hesitated before going through with the work. </p><p>She pursed her lips and her eyebrows slackened, relaxing her face. “No worries. We can do a payment plan.” </p><p>Hellman snapped the hinges of the barrel back onto the shotgun with one hand. Short of pointing it at Rio, he stared at her absentmindedly through his thick glasses. “I think we can say this one’s paid.” He stood up and took a step towards Rio, and she staggered back. “Right?”</p><p>Shaken, Rio backed out of Hellman’s house, holding her resolve together enough to scramble into the truck and drive home. </p><p>She gripped the wheel and the dam broke, filling her eyes with tears and her chest cavity with heaviness. Her lungs strained for air as she choked back a sob. The streetlights distorted in her vision, rays of red, yellow, and green lights stretched and fanned out. </p><p>When Rio got home, she could do nothing but wait for tomorrow, so she passed out on the couch, still clad in her dirty coveralls. </p><p>It was far too early to slumber, but she could not bring herself to survive one more minute awake.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	She woke up late the next morning, forgetting to set her alarm the night before. She tripped out of her dirty coveralls and wriggled into a fresh pair, and then rushed out of the house. As she tore off in the truck, she looked up to find neon red graffiti slashed across the front of her house, on the brick, the windows, and the front door. It was the word “LIAR,” in plain, irate caps for the whole neighborhood to see. </p><p>	“What the <em>fuck</em>?” she spat. Then, it was immediately clear who had done it, and she unclenched her fist. She <em>was </em>a liar. She did not feel the right to resent Agatha for this public declaration. It was gaudy, sure, but Rio had no leg to stand on. </p><p>	She arrived late to her first job of the day. It was a mid-tier restaurant that served giant portions and made their gyros to order. She worked diligently on their walk-in freezer, which was running too warm, but all she could really focus on was those giant red letters defacing her house. And how she hadn’t seen Agatha in what felt like months, and that all she wanted was her. </p><p>Nothing would ever phase Rio again, knowing and blaming herself for lying to Agatha. She went about these days with no sense of purpose, her limbs controlled by the lizard part of her brain, her psyche fragile and her will to live—wretchedly waning. </p><p>	By the time she’d finished at the restaurant, she was running late for her next appointment, which was on the fringes of town. It was an old lady’s house, thirty miles out of the way. Technically, it wasn’t even in Westview; but Rio had accepted her request for work. Anything to keep her hands and mind busy, so she wouldn’t have to confront the fact that she’d fucked up what could’ve been everything she wanted. She didn’t want anything else. </p><p>	The old lady’s property was tucked away in a mini-forest of dead, wintry trees. It was a rundown one-story house, the siding was discolored and had unattached itself from the house at one edge and the roof sagged in the middle. The shrubbery was overgrown, spreading across the lawn, unkempt and scraggly. Rio knocked on the front door apprehensively.</p><p>	A white-haired woman opened the inner door and glared at her. “I d-don’t want you here,” she said, tremulously. </p><p>	“Ma’am, you requested an appointment for the furnace?”</p><p>	“You did not disclose that you had a criminal record,” she hissed. “D-don’t come any closer to m-my house!”</p><p>	“What?” Rio was bewildered.</p><p>	“I read some of your reviews in the Westview Pages and these people say you were arrested for theft and th-that you’re violent.”</p><p>	“I can assure you, that is not true. I don’t know who wrote those reviews, but they’re not true,” Rio assured her. “Please, it’s too cold for you to have a broken furnace.”</p><p>	“Get off my damn property,” the woman barked. “I will not ask again.” </p><p>	Rio acquiesced and left the property, getting back into the truck and pulling up Westview Pages on her phone. She checked her reviews periodically, hovering around the 4.5 star range. Most people said that Rio was honest, offered fair prices, and explained repairs thoroughly. </p><p>Hidden between the good reviews were a slew of recent ones, claiming that she’d been arrested for burglarizing previous clients’ homes, with awfully specific details: apparently Rio had made off with a sapphire engagement ring, a beloved heirloom, a handgun, a wad of cash, a black pearl necklace, a collection of electronics, a set of top-tier power tools—which, she’d supposedly pawned. </p><p>Another review claimed she threatened a client with a crowbar. And another claimed she had a temper. </p><p>Could it be? Was this the work of Agatha too? </p><p>It had to be. It was so blatant and so characteristically <em>her</em>. Rio once again relinquished her anger, because it was nothing compared to the flames she set upon Agatha’s trust in her. This was the public flogging Rio knew she deserved. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	That night, Rio washed the graffiti off the front of her house, painstakingly swabbing it off the front door, pressing her fingers through a microfiber cloth into the nooks and grooves of the hard-to-reach places. </p><p>When she went inside, her back throbbing and her forearms cramping, she couldn’t fight it any longer. She picked up the phone and called Agatha. The line rang and she heard her voice on the other end, unexpectedly. </p><p>	“It is 9 PM. This had better be important,” Agatha growled, clearly unaware it was Rio on the other side.</p><p>	“You picked up,” Rio said, a lump in her throat. Her heart lurched to the surface of her chest, practically pounding out of her skin. To hear Agatha’s voice again restored color to her world, injecting a rush of life into her veins. </p><p>	The other end of the line was silent, but she hadn’t hung up. </p><p>	“Agatha, wait. Please,” Rio begged. “I know you don’t want to hear it, and I know I shouldn’t even be calling. But I—I’m still so sorry. I will regret it until the day I die. I don’t deserve to be forgiven and don’t expect you to—but I will wait for you, even if you don’t care, even if you hate me. I’m—”</p><p>	The line went dead.</p><p>	“Goddamn it,” Rio said, her voice breaking. “I’m in love with you, Agatha.” She said it to no one. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	New Year’s Day had come and gone without much fanfare for Rio. She stayed in, smothering herself under a pile of pillows to block out the sounds of joy and fireworks. </p><p>Over the next few days, Rio found herself waking up to fewer and fewer requests for work. The Westview Pages had made their rounds. </p><p>She received funny looks at the hardware store; one too many overt oglings and exchanged whispers. </p><p>	“What the hell happened?” Lilia asked, perhaps a little too loudly from the counter. “Are you, in fact, a storied criminal, Rio Vidal?”</p><p>	Rio trudged to the front with a basket full of wire and insulated clamps. She set the basket on the counter. “What do you think?”</p><p>	“I’m sorry, kid. Delete those reviews and the storm will settle soon enough,” Lilia said, changing her tone. </p><p>	“Believe me,” Rio said, “I deserve the storm and I should’ve seen it coming.” </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	One night, after Rio had come home from a sparse day of work, the doorbell rang. She was smoking a cigarette through the kitchen window, standing in the dark, hovering over the sink. She put it out and peered over her shoulder, squinting at the door, half-hoping whoever it was would go away.</p><p>	The doorbell rang in a flurry. Rio rushed over and opened the door.</p><p>	Agatha stood on her doorstep. </p><p>	“What are you doing here?” Rio asked, her heart fluttering. Had something changed? </p><p>	“Don’t,” Agatha said, bluntly, as if she could see through her. She didn’t mention the phone call from nights ago. The edge in her demand caught the butterflies in Rio’s stomach and halted them in their tracks. “There’s something going on with the electricity in my office. It’s a fire hazard.” </p><p>	“I’ll take a look,” Rio agreed. She didn’t ask any other questions, too afraid another word out of her mouth would send a shockwave through Agatha’s unpredictability. Why didn’t she call someone else? Why was she here?</p><p>Again, Agatha seemed to read Rio’s mind. “You were my last resort. And you <em>will </em>do the work for free.” 	She wasn’t asking. </p><p>“Of course,” Rio conceded. She didn’t care if it was just work and if she was doing it pro bono. She was in love with a woman who hated her, and the curse was that she would do anything for her. </p><p>She packed a work bag with electrical tools.</p><p>Like the first time they’d met, Rio followed Agatha up the road to her house, except this time, the silence they carried between them was cumbersome with tension and history. </p><p>	Once inside, she followed Agatha up the stairs and to her office. The cuckoo clock ticked on the wall across from Agatha’s desk. Rio smiled to herself.</p><p>	Agatha pointed to the outlet closest to her desk, which was situated across a closet. The outlet sat on a wall adjacent to the desk. Immediately, Rio could smell plastic burning. </p><p>Arms crossed against her chest, Agatha watched as Rio touched the outlet, investigating the source of the burning. She unplugged the power strip and the monitor from the outlet, which revealed a black, scorched outline of the plugs that had been there before. </p><p>	“Dios,” Rio exclaimed. “You’ll set this house on fire.”</p><p>	Agatha ran her fingers through her hair, unbothered. “Well, get to it.” </p><p>	Rio went down the stairs, and then towards the basement, which had Agatha trailing her, asking, “Where the hell are you going?”</p><p>	“I’m going down to the basement, where the fuse box is. I have to turn that breaker off.” </p><p>	Agatha slipped past Rio and led the way, a vestigial sign of her distrust. She followed Agatha into the laundry room, which was stowed away in the back corner of the basement, and it was barely large enough to house the washing machine and dryer. </p><p>Rio brushed behind Agatha, making her way to the fuse box next to the dryer.</p><p>	She found the label for the office and flipped the switch. </p><p>	They went back upstairs to the office. Agatha watched for a while as Rio unscrewed the outlet faceplate and poked around with her multimeter to make sure the wires weren’t live. Eventually, she let Rio be, quietly putzing around in her bedroom. </p><p>	Rio was ready to settle in for a long night, nervous energy suddenly blitzing through her body while she tinkered with the wires.</p><p> 	It was just being here, being around her, remembering her scent that electrified her senses. But that was <em>not </em>what this was about, and it was obvious. </p><p>	The electrical culprit turned out to be loose wiring and lack of insulation around the wire, which Rio could see when she shined the flashlight into the hole in the wall. Within an hour, she was done with the job, and she could release the knots in her neck knowing Agatha’s house wouldn’t go up in flames. </p><p>	As Rio screwed the outlet faceplate back on, Agatha interjected, “I don’t want that burnt one back on there. I want a new one. I was thinking brass, but real antique. I want to see Art Deco designs on there, got it?”</p><p>	“Oh, am I sourcing and buying it?” It was a stupid question and Rio knew it. She nodded. </p><p>	“Now, get the hell outta my house,” Agatha said, unceremoniously. Not a hint of forgiveness. </p><p>	Rio led the way downstairs and Agatha followed. Before she fully left the frame of the open door, she turned around and faced Agatha.</p><p>	She desperately wanted to say something, but the words would not form in her mouth. She just fixated on Agatha, her mind utterly scrambled and her heart flitting in her chest. “I’m—”</p><p>	Agatha’s gaze broke from hers. “Rio, don’t.” </p><p>	“—sorry.” It came out anyway, too late for Rio to suck it back in. “Fuck, I know. I’ll leave. I’m going.” </p><p>	Suddenly, Agatha slammed the door shut, her arm shooting out next to Rio’s head. </p><p>	Rio backed into the door, taken aback, her eyes widening. </p><p>	“<em>Unbelievable</em>. You <em>really </em>think this is about <em>us</em>, don’t you? You’re really delusional enough to think our little <em>blip</em> in my year meant something, don’t you?”</p><p>	A shaky breath escaped Rio’s lungs.</p><p>	Agatha flashed a devilish, cruel smile. “It really was so easy to lie, wasn’t it? You had no qualms until you knew I’d find out. You were just going to keep it to yourself.” </p><p>	“And the worst part—the most embarrassing part—is that I really fell for it. I was falling for you, Vidal,” she avowed. </p><p>	Rio’s stomach twisted, as if a knife had caught onto her organs and wrenched them together. </p><p>	“But you know what I realized? You already told me who you were when you told me about your ex.”</p><p>	Agatha released her hand and released Rio from her makeshift trap. “The thing is: I don’t want to forgive you.”</p>

<p>A heap of days swam by yet again, and Rio burrowed deeper into her cave, leaving beer and San Pellegrino cans and takeout boxes in her wake. The last time she’d seen Agatha remained lodged in her brain, and she did the same favor she’d done for Evette. She left her alone.</p><p>	Agatha had said: <em>I was falling for you</em>. </p><p>	Just as Rio was actively falling with her. </p><p>But “was” was the operative word; Agatha had seized some vine on the cliff face from which they’d fallen, catching herself as she watched Rio plummet, down and down. Agatha had made it clear that she was no longer falling. </p><p>So, Rio swallowed her guilt, for it was hers and hers alone to digest. Each day she slogged and toiled, taking complex and hard jobs on the edges of town. Her regulars were quickly dwindling as the reviews tanked her reputation. She’d repaired a deck, installed a French drain, installed drywall, fixed a series of leaks, all the shit that slowly ruptured the muscles and joints in her body. </p><p>One night on the way home, she got a call from Lilia.</p><p>“Meet us at Jen’s.”</p><p>“‘Us?’”</p><p>“Yes. Hurry.” </p><p>She sounded serious. Rio weaved around the evening traffic and skirted over to Jen’s. </p><p>	The bar was busy, as always, bustling with Thursday night patrons looking for a good deal on drinks and fish and chips. Rio didn’t see Lilia, Billy, or Jen, so she went downstairs. </p><p>	In the back corner of the downstairs area, where the dim lights could not reach, Rio spotted a head of gray hair and a head of curly black hair in the giant booth closest to the dressing rooms. Lilia and Billy. </p><p>	When Rio made it to the table, she saw Jen and Alice, too. She glared at Alice.</p><p>	“What is she doing here?” Rio demanded. Lilia, Jen, and Billy <em>knew </em>they weren’t on good terms. </p><p>	“Tommy is missing,” Billy interjected.</p><p>	Rio instantly tucked away the personal grudge she had against Alice. It was serious enough that she didn’t even feel a twinge of embarrassment.</p><p>	“How long has he been missing?” Rio asked. </p><p>	Billy stuttered. “I don’t know. He hasn’t been at the apartment for two days now. It’s normal for him to stay out, but he always texts me back. He always texts.”</p><p>	Rio clutched his shoulder. </p><p>	Alice had already started arranging a timeline on the table, putting pen to the back of the bar coasters, which were made of thin cardboard. She went through the timeline, introducing it to the group. </p><p>	“Approximately 48 hours ago, Tommy and Billy went to Rusty Hill to see The Hex Keys. The concert ended around 11 PM and Billy went home, while Tommy stayed to get a few more drinks with other patrons he’d met that night.”</p><p>	Alice pointed to the next coaster on the table. “The next day, Tommy did not return to the apartment. This is apparently not out of the ordinary, so Billy went to work and expected to hear from Tommy the next day.” </p><p>Another coaster. “He did not hear from Tommy yesterday.”</p><p>Another one. “This morning, Billy called Tommy, but he didn’t pick up. He then reached out to some of Tommy’s friends to see if any of them had heard from him. Then, he reached out to Rusty Hill to see if the manager or the bartenders had seen him that night.”</p><p>	And onto the next coaster. “It was at 5 PM today that Billy and his parents came down to the station to report Tommy missing.”  </p><p>	“You all called him?” Rio asked. </p><p>	Billy said yes. </p><p>“Alright, so I can start printing posters and flyers out,” Jen said, breaking the monotony of heaviness. She spoke fast, with purpose. </p><p>	“Let’s start asking around his haunts,” Lilia said. “Where’d he like to hang out, Billy?”</p><p>	“He likes music. He likes hanging out at the arcade bar on the east side. He really likes the taco place just a few blocks from Rusty Hill. God, he’s so eccentric. He likes to try new places and he has no routine. How are we going to follow his trail?”</p><p>	“It’s okay, Billy,” Rio assured him. “We can run with what you have for now.” She volunteered to hand out posters. She was calm in a crisis, because she confronted them constantly at work, albeit on a much smaller scale. Panic clouded judgment. </p><p>	Alice agreed. “I’m going to take a look at surveillance cameras around the Rusty Hill area.” </p><p>	“What if we don’t find him? What if he never comes back home?” Billy asked. </p><p>	His eyes glistened with tears, his true youth glimmering through. He was too young to carry the weight of Tommy’s disappearance on his shoulders.  </p><p>	Alice looked at him, imploring him to look at her. She gathered the coasters into a stack and gestured with them. “We will find him.” </p><p>	The group eventually drifted apart, off to their assigned roles. Lilia and Jen flanked Billy, comforting him with wise hands on each of his shoulders.</p><p>Alice stuck around in the booth, and Rio stayed. </p><p>	They stared each other down for a minute, toying with the idea of a duel, silently, carefully, and cautiously. </p><p>	Finally, Alice said, “I didn’t get far in my investigation. Apparently, some records went missing.”</p><p>	The anger rushed back to the surface. She’d said it as if she were doing Rio a solid. “Stay out of her life. And mine.” </p><p>	“Rio—”</p><p>	“Bye.” </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio went home, and like routine, she passed out on the couch. The news of Tommy being missing should’ve kept her up, but when sleep confronted her, she capitulated. She slept for a few hours before something stirred her. </p><p>	It must’ve been around midnight.</p><p>A faint, almost negligible whiff of ash and smoke tickled Rio’s nostrils as she drooled from the corner of her mouth, snoring on her stomach. The smell grew stronger, arousing her senses. Orange light flashed and flared against the sheer curtains facing the front yard. Rio turned to look, blinking the sleep from her eyes. She sniffled, the smoke making her wheeze and cough. </p><p>She saw the unmistakable sight of fire, shooting up and licking the window. </p><p>Then it was clear what was happening.</p><p>Rio rushed outside and was immediately met with the sight of her garden engulfed in flames. </p><p>Fire fed on the bushes against the front of the house, spreading from the dead grass on</p><p>the left side of the path. The fire began to scorch the brick, leaving char marks. Rio stood there, shock coursing through her body, unable to move a muscle. It was the dead of winter, so she’d turned off the hoses; that wouldn’t work. If she waited any longer, the house was certain to catch fire and burn down. </p><p>	“Holy shit.”</p><p>	Rio broke out of her stupor. </p><p>She sprinted inside and seized the fire extinguisher, her fingers went numb in the cold as she fumbled with the pin. Pulling the trigger, Rio swept the hose from side to side, some flames sizzled, but then the embers caught again, continuing to burn. She pulled the trigger again, spraying another layer of foam onto the fire, only to ditch the extinguisher in a panic.</p><p>She slipped as she ran into the kitchen, grabbing a mop bucket from under the sink. She filled it with water and hobbled back outside, splashing water everywhere. Back and forth, she flung six buckets onto the fire, from the left to the right, until she’d put it out. </p><p>With her hands clutching onto her knees, Rio gasped until she could breathe again, her brain still blank with soot and smoke. She looked at the drenched bushes, burnt to black crisps, dripping with water and foam. </p><p>A cylindrical lump caught her eye, laying in front of the bushes. She would’ve noticed it immediately, had it not been enveloped with the wall of fire. </p><p>Rio got closer. </p><p>It was a yule log. The ones that Westview liked to sell at the grocery store, perfectly round, like a cartoonish log, with a rope handle embedded in it. How’d that end up there?</p><p>	Rio tried to pick it up, but she flinched and let it go when she realized it was still hot. She looked at it, as if it’d suddenly grow eyes and glare back at her. </p><p>Then it occurred to her that this was intentional. That someone had thrown the yule log in her yard. Whoever it was, they could’ve opted for a discreet match, but instead, they lit the log on fire and then let it spread to the bushes. </p><p>	They wanted Rio to know. She could’ve burned alive in the house had she not woken up. It was such a callous, reckless act. Rio picked up the log anyway, her hands burning, and heaved it above her head, howling with madness. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	The next evening, Westview gathered in the town hall for Tommy. By the time Rio got there, the police department was already detailing his last whereabouts, Alice standing in uniform, behind the press liaison at the podium. Jen and Lilia must’ve been somewhere in the crowd, seated. </p><p>	Rio hid behind a pillar, listening absentmindedly, her hands fidgeting in her pockets. She stood as still as a statue on the right side, behind the seated crowd. </p><p>She’d been racking her brain all day trying to figure out who the hell could’ve set that fire. At first, she considered a complete stranger. Deranged and out of their mind, perhaps they could’ve picked Rio’s house at random. But it seemed improbable.</p><p>Eventually, her mind wandered to Agatha. </p><p>But it couldn’t be her. That would be insane. Right?</p><p>This person meant for Rio’s house to burn down, with her <em>in it</em>. Agatha didn’t hate anyone enough to put that much effort into literal arson. <em>Did she</em>?</p><p>She heard a ripple of whispers in the crowd, and she trailed the sound until her eyes fell upon the devil. </p><p>Agatha stood on the left side, leaning against a pillar, unbothered and sharp. She was dressed like a professor, in a tweed coat, white shirt, and copper-colored pants. </p><p>If this was her attempt to blend in, it had failed miserably. Rio wanted to peel her eyes off of her, but she lingered, loitering on the cords of her neck, the plane of her jaw, and the sheen of her hair, styled yet hinting to something unhinged. So, Rio indulged lazily and without haste, until Agatha suddenly turned and caught her eye. </p><p>Rio ripped her head the other way, blushing. <em>Rookie</em>. </p><p>The press liaison was a red-faced man with a haggard white buzz cut, and he spoke with a booming intonation every few words, sending echoes through the hall. </p><p>“If you have any information about Tommy’s last known whereabouts, please reach out to us.”</p><p>Some people recoiled, their shoulders shrinking. Some people leaned back, as if the soundwaves had pushed them back. </p><p>“In the meantime, we’re asking for volunteers to help us search for Tommy.”</p><p>Rio snuck another glimpse at Agatha, searching for any inkling that would reveal if she had anything to do with the fire. Her expression didn’t display much. What was there was that cocksure attitude Rio had known so well. </p><p>The press liaison began to field a line of rapid-fire questions. A clamor of voices broke out against one another, but they quieted down when the man pointed at one person at a time. Rio couldn’t focus, again pulling her attention away, to steal another glance at Agatha. But this time, she wasn’t there; she wasn’t leaning against the pillar. </p><p>Straining her neck, Rio poked her head out from her own pillar, scanning the crowd for Agatha, looking for her hair, her shoulders, her slinking walk. She was nowhere to be seen in the crowd. Then, from the corner of her eye, Rio detected movement in the long, winding hallway on the left side of the crowd. The swish of that tweed coat stood out against the darkness, traveling further and further down the hall. What was she doing over there? </p><p>Rio took a breath and wrenched her focus back to the red-faced man and the crowd. “When do you think we’ll start the search? Will you provide training?”</p><p>She looked away again. And back. And then away again, Agatha no longer visible. The tentacles of Rio’s curiosity took hold of her, steering her by the core, down that hallway. She was careful to walk sedately, like the waves of a calm lake. </p><p>Once the shroud of darkness sunk upon Rio, she sped up, her shoes catching on the glossy flooring, peering through gridded-glass windows in the big heavy wooden doors on each side of the hall. Each room was dark. Most of them were offices. </p><p>There were a few doors without windows on them, though the plaques to the right of each door labeled them: there was a records room, a shredding room, a licensing room. Rio tried each door, grabbing onto the handles. Each door was locked.</p><p>	Where had Agatha gone? She needed to know. She wanted to know. She wanted to follow her.</p><p>	The next door Rio tried was the tax and revenue room, which she nearly fell through, expecting a locked handle. She wandered in, letting the door close behind her, the room dimly lit, save for one row of fluorescent lights blinking and buzzing in the far corner. </p><p>The room was ominous yet mundane. Quiet, yet alive. </p><p>Rio faced lines and lines of metal cabinets, presumably laden with tax documents. Strolling down an aisle, she drew her fingers against the cabinets, listening past the white noise of the buzzing lights, listening for Agatha’s presence. </p><p>She held her breath, and tempered her heartbeat and peeked around the corner of one aisle, and then another. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up, a premonition of <em>her</em>. </p><p>Still, Rio bit her tongue, refusing to call out her name. She moved into the next aisle, and still, Agatha wasn’t there. Rio’s shoulders dropped, naturally, unguarded. Maybe it was just a coincidence that this door had been unlocked. She sighed hard and turned toward the door.</p><p>When she turned her back against the darkness, a force shoved her against the cabinets, and a hand clasped around the back of her neck. The breath hissed from Rio’s lungs. </p><p>She flipped around. </p><p>Agatha seized Rio’s hand, and pinned it above her head. Knuckles pressed into the cabinet, Rio grunted involuntarily, a pinching, bruising pain in her tendons. </p><p>Neither of them said anything. </p><p>Agatha glared holes through Rio, and Rio glared back. They breathed against each other, filling the inches between them with a heavy, tenuous silence. </p><p>“So it was you, then?” Rio interrogated, finally. The context of the question was as vibrant as the red paint Agatha had smeared on the front of her house.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Her eyes simply darted up and down Rio’s face, stopping on her mouth. There was a perverse sparkle in her eye. Was it mischief? Exhilaration? </p><p>Her silence was <em>almost </em>enough confirmation for Rio, and a typhoon of rage descended through her chest, drilling deep into her core. She flashed back to that fire, caressing the bones of her house, the heat singeing her arm hairs as she had approached it. </p><p>“Answer me.” Rio wanted her to say it aloud. “You set the fire, didn’t you?” She was certainly <em>not </em>in the position to be the interrogator, with Agatha’s weight pressed against her. </p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened around Rio’s hand, and she slammed it against the cabinet. “And what the hell are you going to do about it?” </p><p>Rio clenched her teeth and fought against her strength, but she was shockingly strong, her hold unwavering. “Agatha,” she hissed. </p><p>All Rio could muster was her name, under the sudden tension growing in between her legs. Her heartbeat had dropped to her thighs, beating furiously. But she was <em>angry at her</em>; she shouldn’t have been <em>aroused</em>. Why was she aroused? And <em>what </em>was Agatha doing? </p><p>“Look,” Rio said, breaking through the heat, “I know I got what I deserved. When you vandalized my house, when you tanked my business, when you froze me out, that was my punishment.”</p><p>“But then, you tried to <em>burn my fucking house down with me in it</em>. Is that what I deserved? You wanted me to fucking die?” Her hands found their courage and Agatha’s chest, flinging her off.</p><p>Agatha staggered back. She chortled at first. And then she cackled. “So, I got carried away. It was a spur of the moment idea, and I just couldn’t resist.” </p><p>She knocked Rio down a few notches. </p><p>“You couldn’t resist?!”</p><p>It was as if they’d stepped into an alternate dimension, where Rio’s head spun at dizzying speed, unable to form a thread to follow, to rationalize what the hell Agatha was doing. She was <em>laughing</em> with an unmistakably genuine delight. And yet, days ago, she acted as if she’d never see Rio again. </p><p>“The pretense to attempted murder is that you ‘couldn’t resist?!’ What the fuck?” </p><p>Rio bared her teeth in disbelief. </p><p>“Oh, don’t be so dramatic. ‘Attempted murder?’ So theatrical,” Agatha scoffed. She rolled her eyes. “Your house hardly burned.” </p><p>“And what if it had?” Rio grilled.</p><p>“It didn’t,” she said. She puckered her lips, mocking Rio. </p><p>“Jesus,” Rio breathed to herself. She wrinkled her forehead with the tips of her fingers, giving herself a moment of respite. This was not at all how she’d imagined the night would go. With her hand behind her back, she leaned against the cabinets, distancing herself from Agatha.</p><p>“So, what are you doing then? You tell me to stay away and now you’re laughing?” Every time Rio presumed to know Agatha, the woman only proved she was an enigma—not to be solved, but to be savored. </p><p>“You followed me back here, didn’t you?” Agatha’s voice slung low, like a playful threat.</p><p>Rio didn’t have an answer. She did follow her, cursed with yearning, with her own basest desires. Knowing it was Agatha who’d set the fire—it suddenly didn’t matter much to her anymore. Her wild urges expanded, uncontrollably, like an invasive flower, blanketing everything over. </p><p>	“Why did you follow me?”</p><p>	“I thought you wanted me to follow you.”</p><p>	“You’re pathetic,” Agatha taunted, shimmying out of her tweed coat and then letting it fall to the floor. “It’s written all over your face. Don’t tell me you’re going to lie to me.” </p><p>	She took Rio by the hips and pushed her against the cabinets. Her lips brushed the side of Rio’s neck and she spoke again. “I’ll ask you one last time.” </p><p>	This was poisonous. Irresistible.</p><p> 	Rio’s mind swirled with anticipation, her heart jumping into her throat. The façade of her resolve washed away, like sand. Her wires crossed, sparking violently. </p><p>	“Why did you follow me?”</p><p>Agatha had eroded Rio’s dignity down to the primal ache that cooked underneath it all. She kissed Rio’s neck and inhaled her skin, fiddling with her emotions, her desire, and her sanity.  </p><p>“You know why,” Rio whispered. Her cheeks flushed with a hotness that traveled down to her chest.</p><p>“Don’t chicken out now,” Agatha goaded. “Unless I’m reading this the wrong way; I wouldn’t want—”</p><p>She pulled back, her arm above Rio’s head. </p><p>“—to assume anything.” </p><p>“Is this you forgiving me?” Rio asked. </p><p>Agatha took Rio by the jaw and turned her face to the side abruptly. “<em>Don’t.</em> That’s not what this is.”</p><p>	“Tell me why you were following me,” she pressed again. </p><p>	“I followed you because…” Rio wrested her neck to face Agatha, exposing her inner thoughts. “...I want you. Is that what you want to hear? It’s the truth. I haven’t stopped thinking about you. Tonight, when I saw you, all I could think about was what it would be like to kiss you again.”</p><p>	Agatha’s blue eyes glinted, and her lips curled into the subtlest smirk. She knew she’d won. She took Rio’s chin between her thumb and index finger, fixated on her lips. </p><p>Rio leaned forward into her touch, her lips parting, straining, stopping short of kissing her. She could not steal the kiss from Agatha, it was not her place. She could only accept a kiss.	</p><p>Sliding one foot between Rio’s, Agatha kicked her legs apart, not breaking eye contact once. With one hand still clasping Rio’s jaw, her other hand cupped Rio’s crotch, hard, over her black jeans. “Is this what you want?”</p><p>“Y-yes,” Rio gasped. Only Agatha could make her stutter. </p><p>“Just like this?” She groped up and down, teasing her through her jeans. “You’re pathetic. After all this, you still follow me like a dog.”</p><p>Rio nodded. She grew wet between her legs, her body drawing itself closer to Agatha, wanting more. “I can’t stay away from you.” </p><p>Agatha dragged her thumb across Rio’s bottom lip, immediately earning entry into her mouth, between her teeth. Her other hand had unzipped Rio’s jeans with haste. “Where do you want me?”</p><p>Biting down on her thumb, Rio gazed at Agatha, surrendering. “Inside me.” She trembled as she watched Agatha, following her hand down her jeans, settling over the soft fabric of her underwear. Agatha’s lips captured Rio’s briefly, as her fingers rubbed over her underwear. </p><p>Rio moaned into her mouth, a storm of butterflies unfurling in her stomach. </p><p>Her arousal escalated, and she passionately took Agatha by the waist with one arm and with the other, she held her face. </p><p>Agatha broke from the kiss and snatched Rio’s wrist and pinned it against the cabinet without hesitation. “No.” She put Rio in her place, and Rio didn’t fight. She could only take what she would get. She grunted and looked at Agatha with hazy eyes, begging for more. </p><p>“Please,” Rio longed. She was completely at her mercy, her dignity in a different zip code. </p><p>Agatha’s fingers only teased her harder, still not inside. Rio bucked her hips against her fingers, desperately meeting her, accelerating. “Is this all that you think about?” she asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Suddenly the hand caressing Rio’s jaw hardened, tightening around her neck, holding her in place. With her other hand, she slipped her middle and ring fingers inside Rio. </p><p>She implored Rio to challenge her unwavering eye contact, her intensely blue eyes drunk with power, as she fucked her, meeting all her demands. “Am I all that you think about?” she asked.</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>.”</p><p>Her fingers coaxed Rio, each stroke authoritative and purposeful. Rio panted with each stroke, woefully unprepared for the tickling feeling growing inside her. </p><p>A cry emerged from her mouth as she came, suddenly and uncontrollably. She seized Agatha’s wrist, pressing it into her skin. </p><p>Agatha took a breath and blinked, taking in Rio’s defeat, her unraveling. Then, she leaned in close to her ear and whispered. “This doesn’t change anything, my love.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say; her chest heaved; blood rushed between her legs; her heartbeat galloped to her fingertips, like a needle lancing her skin with every throb. She felt everything at once, not hiding the anguish broken across her face. </p><p>All she could do was stand there, bare with desolation, poisoned with the end of her lust, as she watched Agatha gather her coat, preening as she pulled her hair out. She truly meant it. And yet, she was so tender, as to call her by such a delicate name.</p><p>“I just needed a warm body tonight,” Agatha said, not looking at Rio. The door closed behind her without fanfare. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio waited for everyone to clear out of the town hall, peeking through a crack in the door before strutting through the dark, and into the night. </p><p>	Agatha had found her weak spot, exploiting it, and fracturing her from the inside out. And Rio wallowed and reveled in every second of it. It was as if two karmic claws of the universe had hooked into the stretchy flesh of her psyche, and fought to tear it apart from opposite ends. </p><p>Agatha had quenched Rio’s hot, blistering thirst with a torrential flood, yes. It was a fantasy fulfilled. But it wasn’t enough. That couldn’t be the last time. And she had said that it didn’t change anything—that she just needed a warm body. It was cruel, how she used her body, but Rio couldn’t lie—she’d give herself up again in a heartbeat. She could not stop herself, even against the headwinds of heartbreak and utter solitude.</p><p>Rio didn’t know how to feel. She’d sailed the zenith of a ten-thousand foot wave and then dove into the unending trenches of pitch black darkness. The wound in her heart widened, though, because she knew what she wanted. People always talked about how complicated human beings and their desires were. People were simple. They hid their true intentions under layers of flimsy rationalizations.</p><p>And Rio was no different. She simply wanted Agatha. She wanted to be with her. She wanted her forgiveness. She wanted her love, her desire, and her being. </p><p>Rio checked her phone to find ten missed messages and calls from Lilia, Billy, and Jen. They’d seen her at the town hall and tried to find her. She doubted that anyone had seen the two of them disappear into the hallway; everyone was there to find Tommy. </p><p>The reality of the situation settled on Rio and she shook herself out of her self-indulgent introspection. She drove home and went to sleep.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	The next morning, Rio rolled her recycling bin down to the curb, haphazardly dressed in a pair of shorts and a giant sweatshirt, hiding under a black beanie. It was entirely too cold to be in shorts, but the recycling truck would be around soon.</p><p>She hoped nobody else would be up this early, but of course, she looked up to see none other than the ghost of last night. Agatha stood on the other side of the street, with Señor Scratchy hugged close to her chest, as if she’d just picked him up. </p><p>She wore a matching black set of sweats, still looking elegant. </p><p>Rio couldn’t meet her gaze, and when she finally snuck a glance, Agatha wasn’t looking. She’d never even noticed. Rio clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms, flashing back to her touch, her scent, and her cruelty. She felt everything. Her stomach was in knots and her heart fluttered with a sick thrill. All she could do was watch, catching the tails of Agatha’s ghost in her head.</p><p>Deflated, Rio went back inside, throwing a kettle on the stove to brew a cup of startlingly strong tea. Her phone buzzed from the dining room table as she sat down with a piece of toast. Her group chat with Lilia, Jen, and Billy fired off, blitzing a mile a minute. She waded through the sea of messages, and the gist of it was that the search for Tommy was starting this morning. </p><p>Billy said the cops had found something in the alleyway, and that the search was urgent. Everyone would meet at the sports pub near Rusty Hill in an hour. </p><p>After finishing breakfast, Rio got dressed. It was cold, damp, and a bit frosty. The sun hid behind patches of cottony gray clouds, illuminating Westview with a sleepy sheen. The rain came and went, fluttering in and out like a swarm of song sparrows. Rio threw on a pair of rust-colored pants, boots, and a long green rain jacket over her sweater. </p><p>Before Rio hit the road, she cleaned out her truck, which had grown more and more cluttered as she worked herself to the bone the last few weeks. She put the forgotten and loose wrenches, mallets, hand saws, and screwdrivers back in their designated places in the garage and then drove to the pub.</p><p>	Cars had taken up most of the block near Rusty Hill, so Rio found a space at a shuttered auto shop and walked to the pub. She could hear chatter from the outside, the front doors propped open. It was not lively chatter, though; there was a solemn undertone hissing underneath everyone’s low voices. </p><p>Police officers and volunteers handed out maps, and Rio took one before entering. </p><p>	People filled the pub, packed into the tables, settling into wooden chairs which had been painted maroon, buzzing anxiously as they waited for the leader of the search to start their presentation. </p><p>Lilia and Jen waved at Rio from a small, rectangular table near the back of the building, where everyone was facing. Billy spoke with Alice, his hands clasped tightly around a rolled up map. Rio ignored her.</p><p>As more people wandered into the pub, the last few stools at the bar were taken and the stragglers leaned against the black brick walls. </p><p>The brick was adorned with colorful flags from various sports; mostly baseball and college basketball. TVs punctuated the room, hung high on the walls, all of them displaying a recent picture of Tommy. He glowed on the screen, with his dirty-blond hair tucked behind his ears, under a backwards baseball cap. His green eyes had a charming sparkle to them, laidback and warm. Alongside his photo was a picture of a red plaid shirt, a ridiculous tape-recorder vape he carried around, and a square turquoise ring he liked to wear sometimes. </p><p>Cube-shaped lights dropped from the ceiling, washing the pub in a warm, inviting yellow. 	“Did I miss anything?” Rio asked, taking a seat at the table.	</p><p>“No,” Lilia said. “They’re just about to start.”</p><p>	A woman in a blue Westview Police windbreaker whistled through her fingers to quiet the room down, and then she climbed up on a chair, towering over the room. She wore her hair in a tight bun, which made her look shorter than she was. </p><p>	“Good morning, folks!” She waved above her head. “I’ll get right to it. My name is Rebecca and I’ll be your search leader. Today, we’re going to start canvassing the area and searching for Tommy. We’re looking at about a three-mile radius, alright?” Her voice was clear, like a bell, traveling through the crowd with ease. There was a twang in her accent, which Rio found oddly comforting.</p><p>	She held up a map, fruitlessly, going over the grid lines, explaining how the search would be divided geographically. Some folks squinted to see what she was pointing at, and some studied the maps in their laps.</p><p>	Jen made notes on the map as Rebecca spoke, emphasizing Rusty Hill with a circle. She wrote bullet points as the woman went through general safety guidelines and instructions. </p><p>	“Please follow the instructions as best you can, okay? We don’t want to make more work for ourselves. If you find something or see something, <em>do not touch it</em>. You will contaminate it, okay?”</p><p>The reality settled upon the room. There was a silent understanding that everyone would conduct the search with the utmost care. </p><p>	Rebecca continued. She directed people to the volunteers and other police personnel stationed throughout the pub, where everyone would be assigned a square area of land to search.</p><p>	“God, I hope we find him,” Jen whispered to Rio. </p><p>	“Me, too. This is awful,” Rio said.</p><p>	“Any questions?” Rebecca asked. </p><p>	A few hands poked up from the room. From the corner of her eye, Rio saw Billy staring at her absentmindedly, now leaning in the far right corner of the pub by himself. He was close to an exit door. She caught his gaze and he waved like a zombie, as if she’d roused him from sleep. Rio slithered between the tables and made her way over to Billy, trying her best not to attract attention. </p><p>	She embraced him in a heavy-hearted hug. When they pulled apart, she squeezed his lean upper arms. “I’m sorry, Billy. This can’t be easy.” </p><p>	A haunting look of despair pervaded his dark eyes. “Rio, they found his phone and AirTag in the alleyway next to Rusty Hill.” Tears filled his eyes.</p><p>	The room broke with chatter and footsteps as people shuffled around the tables for their search assignments. Rio crossed her arms and stepped closer to Billy.</p><p>	“I just don’t know—” he shut his eyes and his chin quivered. “I don’t know what to think. My mind keeps going to the worst places.” </p><p>	“I know, I know.” Rio couldn’t say much more. There wasn’t much one could say to comfort someone in this situation. </p><p>	“Rio, what if he’s gone? What if he’s—”</p><p>	She held his shoulders and hugged him again. “We don’t know that, kid. But we’re all here, right? We’re going to do everything we can to see this through.” </p><p>	He nodded, his chin prodding into her shoulder. She wiped away a tear with her thumb and smiled softly and warmly at him. She’d grown fond of Billy in these months. </p><p>“Thank you.” He excused himself and went to find his parents, and Rio went back inside for her assignment, lining up behind everyone at the table closest to the door. She was the last in the line. </p><p>The line snaked inch by inch and the bearded ginger man at the table doled out assignments efficiently. Lilia and Jen waved at her as they followed their group out the front door, off to their search area.</p><p>Rio studied the map closely, shutting out everyone and everything going on around her. </p><p>She started at Rusty Hill and spiraled out. The bar sat on a street with many other restaurants and some businesses here and there. Among them, a tax consultant, a postal office, a convenience store, and a tutoring service. Further north and east, there were residential areas. Two separate neighborhoods lined with single-family homes, which both bordered a small park. Then to the west, there was a museum and a larger park with art installations. </p><p>South of Rusty Hill, there was a community garden, stretching out in a strip about half a mile long. Beyond the garden, there was a wooded area that was still part of Westview, but was completely unkempt and undeveloped. It wasn’t very deep, though, and it bordered a backroad that winded five miles into a major highway. </p><p>Suddenly, she looked up and the group in front of her had split off. The man sat across from her, surprised as she was. </p><p>“Oh. I did not see you behind those guys,” he said. “I have a few squares left here, but I can’t send you out there by yourself.”</p><p>“Right,” she said, nodding. </p><p>	She suddenly felt a breeze, sweeping over her. </p><p>	The man leaned over to the right, looking past her. “Looks like we have someone here you can go search with.” He pointed, and then in a split-second, his face dropped.</p><p>Rio looked over her shoulder.</p><p>“Ma’am, I’m s-surprised to see you.” </p><p>Rio’s stomach corkscrewed, cramping at the sight of Agatha so soon, and so suddenly. This seemed to be her forte, lately, to manifest from thin air just as Rio was distracting herself. </p><p>So there Agatha was, shouldering a wool-lined black leather jacket, black turtleneck, black jeans, and black combat boots. Black like Rio’s scorched heart. </p><p>As she tilted her head up, Agatha’s blue eyes peeked out from under the brim of her black baseball cap. As always, her hair looked perfectly wild and tousled. At the front of the cap was a gravestone poking through tall grasses and purple azaleas. It was as Agatha as she could be. </p><p>“Don’t ever call me ma’am again,” Agatha said to the man, who’d suddenly shrunken two sizes. </p><p>“Sorry,” the man mumbled. </p><p>Rio pinched her legs through her jacket pockets, wanting nothing more but to melt into a puddle.</p><p>The red-haired man grabbed a map, and circled a grid near the middle of the wooded area and handed it to Agatha. He started going over the instructions, but stopped abruptly when she shot a glare through his head. “Well, good luck out there with your new friend here.” </p><p>	“Oh, she’s no friend,” Agatha snarled. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Out of everyone who could’ve shown up for the search effort, it had to be Agatha. And <em>of course</em>, the two of them had been paired to venture into the woods together. Not in a group, where others would have served as a buffer. Not in town, where all eyes would have been glued to their every move. No, they had nothing but the distance between them and the brittle branches of the woods. The other search parties that had been assigned to the woods wandered further away, just out of earshot. </p><p>Rio and Agatha walked alongside one another, leaving a comical two-foot valley between them. They followed a designated path that the police had cleared, cutting through the commercial and residential area, leading them to the community garden.</p><p>The frosted twigs crunched beneath their feet as they trudged past the garden and into the woods, still not a single word exchanged. </p><p>Agatha wouldn’t look at Rio, and Rio was too afraid to lay eyes on her without turning lobster red. This woman had been <em>inside her </em>last night. And now they were acting as if they were strangers who’d been assigned the same row of seats on a plane. What the hell was the universe doing to Rio?</p><p>She looked down at the map, burying the awkward tension, trying to follow the path as best she could. Agatha followed closely behind. </p><p>Rio could feel her eyes on her, burning the nape of her neck. But still, she focused on searching for clues, honing in on the wet heaps of decomposing leaves covering every inch of the ground. </p><p>And then in a moment of painstaking silence, Agatha matter-of-factly blurted out, “I think I was at Rusty Hill the night Tommy disappeared.”</p><p>Rio turned around. “What?”</p><p>The look on Agatha’s face was one of sheer terror and realization. She had just remembered it now. That devil-may-care attitude she had slung on just half an hour ago suddenly shattered. She held her palm out, and in it was a ticket stub. </p><p>Taking the ticket from her palm, Rio read it: 7 PM DOORS - THE HEX KEYS - RUSTY HILL. Nearly a week ago, when Tommy went missing. </p><p>“You don’t remember?” Rio asked. </p><p>“I was fucking blotto by the time I got there,” Agatha admitted. Though she was stoic, Rio could see past it. She could see the tremble in Agatha’s hands and the frantic retrieval of trust in her eyes.</p><p>Rio knew in her bones that Agatha would never hurt Tommy. That was never even a consideration. “You didn’t have anything to do with it, Agatha,” she said, firmly. </p><p>“How do you know?” Agatha asked, her blue eyes truthful and unguarded. </p><p>“I know you,” Rio said. “You’re a good person, no matter how hard you try to deny it. You’d never hurt Billy or Tommy.” </p><p>Agatha blinked at her, looking diminutive under her cap.</p><p>Rio took her by the shoulders and emphasized her words. </p><p>“<em>Agatha, you’d never hurt anyone like that</em>.” </p><p>Her shoulders uncocked, dropping slowly, as if she was absorbing it all. She looked deeply in Rio’s eyes, blinking once, freezing time, her gaze flickered down to her lips. Last night came rushing back to Rio and the things Agatha had said, and the lecherous ways she’d used her body. Somehow, she didn’t believe those things she’d said anymore. This moment felt so different. </p><p>But she couldn’t stomach the thought of begging for her and then losing her again.</p><p>Rio wrenched herself away. “We should get back to the search.” </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and agreed.</p><p>They went on in silence for a few minutes, trudging carefully through the woods. Sometimes Rio led, and sometimes she followed, the two of them searching around each other with an unspoken rhythm. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, “you probably should tell the police you were there that night. It’s only a matter of time before they find out and start asking questions.” </p><p>She groaned. “You know I can’t. You know they’ve got it out for me.”</p><p>“I know, I’ve read the papers.” Rio had picked up a branch and used it to flick a lone cigarette box around.</p><p>“Wait a second, you’re not still working with Alice, are you? You’re not—you’re not still working with the police, are you?” she questioned. </p><p>Before Rio could answer, Agatha stepped back, fuming aloud. “God, what the hell was I thinking? Stupid, stupid, stupid.”</p><p>Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand from behind. “I’m not. You <em>can </em>trust me.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hand and then back at Rio, entirely unprepared and off-balance. She stumbled back over a thick, rope-like tree root. Rio caught her by the waist and clutched onto her arm, pulling her up and close to her.</p><p>“I’m worried, that’s all,” Rio said, as if spoken to a dandelion. “Am I not allowed to worry now?”</p><p>“No, you’re not,” Agatha shot back. “Who are you to worry? You’re not my keeper.” </p><p>Rio released Agatha, distancing herself. She turned around, continuing the search. She snapped some pictures of trash: a blue plastic bag with an unopened packet of tissues and candy wrappers. It seemed overly fastidious, but anything could be a clue. </p><p>“You know what I think?” Rio asked aloud. “I think you’ve forgiven me, even if you don’t want to admit it.”</p><p>“Is this about last night? You know what I said.” Agatha's eyes penetrated her brittle resolve. </p><p>Rio wanted to fold. She wanted to drop to her knees and worship the ground Agatha walked on, but she would not. She had to retain the remnants of her dignity. She continued forward, her boots knocking against tangles of downed branches, spotting a black piece of plastic protruding from a layer of leaves. </p><p>“Oh, what? You’re giving me the silent treatment?” Agatha trailed behind her. </p><p>Crouching down, Rio excavated the piece of plastic from the leaves with her walking stick, revealing a rectangular body to which it was attached. There was a set of square buttons on one side of it. Most of the paint on the buttons had worn off, except for a red circle glaring at Rio. A record button. The black plastic was a mouthpiece. “Agatha, <em>look</em>. This is Tommy’s vape.”  </p><p>Agatha hovered over the vape, inhaling sharply. She took pictures with her phone. “Let’s keep going.” </p><p>The two continued on, searching faster now, with more purpose. They left last night to dissipate. That didn’t matter now. </p><p>Rio came upon a distinctive part of the ground. The leaves looked disturbed, scattered on each side of the ground, unveiling one barely visible shoe print. It had a distinctive rose design on its heel and the soles were segmented. </p><p>They reached the end of the woods, met with a barbed wire fence. On the other side was a stretch of weeds and a road. The middle of the fence had been cut and bent, leaving a hole for someone to get in and out. Something flapped in the breeze, in the middle of the fence. </p><p>“Oh, my God. Rio, that’s part of his shirt,” Agatha said, pointing to the piece of red plaid cloth caught on the sharp, cut-ends of the fence. Just like the one displayed in the missing photo. </p><p>Rio’s blood ran cold, down to her fingers. The hairs on the back of her neck stood and her stomach flipped. </p><p>Had he ran here of his own accord? Was he trying to get away? Was he long gone from Westview? Was he hurt?</p><p>	Rio phoned the search leader and the two started the trek back to the pub, desperate to find someone to examine the area. That boot print wouldn’t stay for too much longer in this rainy weather.</p>

<p>As Rio and Agatha rounded the hill back into town, a swarm of forensic analysts and police descended upon the woods. A moody, lavender sky bore down on the horizon, like a harbinger for the next day. </p><p>	When they finally reached the block near the pub, Rio sheepishly dawdled, fiddling with the tie strings on her jacket. Agatha fumbled around in her leather jacket for her keys. </p><p>	“Can I walk you to your car?” Rio asked.</p><p>	“Chivalrous,” Agatha jeered.</p><p>	“Is that a ‘yes’ or ‘no’?”</p><p>	“Look, I don’t know what the hell you’re trying to do. I know we’ve been civil today, but that’s all it is. I’m here to find Tommy,” Agatha said, coldly and finally. </p><p>“Okay, got it,” Rio said, leaving it alone. She could not beg again. “Good night.” </p><p>	Rio watched her walk away and then sighed with her whole chest. She reached her car, hanging onto the handle of her truck for a minute, lying to herself. This whiplash had walloped her, thoroughly, pulverizing what was left of her outer shell, until she finally admitted defeat. </p><p>Soon after, Rio found herself at the pub, ordering an IPA. She couldn’t bear to go home, a stone’s throw away from the woman she was in love with.</p><p>	Every time Rio encountered the woman, she was left grasping onto the fraying threads of her sanity. It was maddening, seductive, heart-wrenching, and exhausting. </p><p>Rio stood at the bar, hunching into the collar of her jacket, hoping she wouldn’t run into anyone else tonight. She didn’t want to see Jen or Lilia; she wanted to ruminate. She wanted to simmer and simmer until she couldn’t make heads or tails of her heartbreak anymore. </p><p>	The most infuriating part of all this was that Rio could <em>feel</em> Agatha resisting. She <em>knew </em>that she’d forgiven her. But did she want the same thing that Rio did? Or was Rio far too presumptuous in her passive pursuit? Was this the time for defeat?</p><p>	A woman pulled up a seat next to Rio, her elbow brushing against her. Side-eyeing the woman, Rio sized her up.</p><p>She was an attractive, early thirty-something with olive skin and red dahlia lips that were perhaps a bit orange in the pub lighting. “Hi,” she said, grinning at Rio. </p><p>Rio acknowledged her.</p><p>“You’re the handywoman, right?”</p><p>“Yes. And you are…?”</p><p>	The woman said her name. It was something pretty, something common. The cacophony of glasses clinking and people jabbering smothered it, like chemical foam over flame, and Rio didn’t care to ask again. “Can I buy you a drink?” the woman asked. </p><p>	Rio wasn’t oblivious; this was obvious flirtation. She chose to be an opportunist at this moment, accepting the drink. Anything but to go home.</p><p>	“How are you liking Westview?” she asked. Then, a stream of honest, earnest questions. Rio answered them, superficially, never intending to let the conversation percolate. </p><p>	“The funny thing is, I came to Westview to keep my head down and lay low, but if anything, I just keep digging myself into holes I can’t seem to get out of. Laying low is not really a thing here, is it?”</p><p>	“Hon, in Westview, you can see all the way to the other end of town from here. Everyone knows everyone’s business,” the woman said, touching her hand, propositioning her.</p><p>	“I’m starting to think I’m digging these holes on purpose,” Rio said, to herself, mostly. </p><p>	“Can I ask you something?” The woman didn’t wait for Rio to respond. “Before I get ahead of myself—you’re single, right?”</p><p>	Rio stopped mid-sip, and gulped down a mouthful of her beer. The answer was simple yet undefinable. </p><p>	“I saw you and Agatha Harkness in the woods today, and it seemed like there was something going on between you two,” she explained. “Are you two—?” She gestured with her index finger, vaguely and roundly.</p><p>	“You saw us?” Rio asked, absentmindedly deflecting the question.</p><p>	“Our group was about 200 yards away. We weren’t eavesdropping or anything. We just heard a rustle and saw the two of you,” she said, quickly. “Look, I’ll be candid. I’d love to take you dancing, but I’m not about to get between you and Agatha-fuckin’-Harkness. I have survival instincts, you know.” </p><p>	Upon this impasse, Rio could not answer. Even when Agatha wasn’t around, Rio couldn’t seem to outrun her. She thanked the woman for the drink and rushed into the reprieve of the freezing winter darkness. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	The next morning, Rio stood at the window, drinking passable coffee and watching the hum-drum drone of life on her street. She didn’t have any work scheduled this morning, so she started the day at the town square. She started with a leisurely pastry from a trendy, new coffee stop and then went to the market for produce, aimlessly wandering through the aisles without a list, without a plan. </p><p>	She arrived at the tomatoes, onions, and avocados, debating whether she wanted tacos and guacamole or something else entirely. Rio tended to cook many of her mother’s recipes and then fell back on stir-fries and pastas when she needed something different. But nothing called out to her; nothing was <em>right</em>.</p><p>She settled on a pesto linguine with roasted tomatoes, because it was a classic and she could dissociate while she prepared it. <em>Anything </em>to leave the constraints of her psyche. </p><p>	After an early lunch, Rio ventured to the Apothecary Heights to install window AC units. Jessica, the manager, mumbled over the phone that she’d provide the units and pay in cash. There were ten units to install at various ends of the apartment complex. </p><p>Rio arrived at the front office, where she could barely see Jessica, a rotund, short white woman with straw-colored hair, enclosed in stacks of stapled paper packets and plastic bins of random apartment shit. There were bathroom fan motors, dishwashing racks, tennis rackets, DVDs, and books. </p><p>	“The units are in the back parking lot,” Jessica said, not looking up from her computer. She wore a pair of black-rimmed rectangular glasses. “I’ll pay you half now and half after you’re done.” Jessica held out a stylish wad of cash, coiled tightly into a roll. </p><p>	Usually, Rio would protest this underhanded type of business, but she just wanted to get to work. She took the cash from Jessica and pushed it into a pocket with a zipper. </p><p>	She got to work immediately, assessing the units in the back. Every single one was a different model and they all varied wildly in model year and style. Jessica had clearly thrifted them, as some were dented and dusty. </p><p>But, they were all the right size for the apartment windows, and Rio could get behind the utilitarian effort of Jessica’s vision. </p><p>	Starting on the westernmost room that needed an AC unit, Rio hauled it on a rickety dolly, through the small park in the center of the complex. This work was not easy on her back, especially as one person, but by the time she installed the third one, Rio had developed a system.</p><p>	Rio checked the time on her phone as she arrived at the next apartment; it was almost 2 PM. The screen turned black and she scoffed to herself. She had forgotten to charge it last night, but she’d live until she was done with this job—nothing else was scheduled. She slipped the phone in her back pocket and put her gloves back on, bending at the knees to pick up the unit. </p><p>	She’d made it through several units without a hitch, until the sixth one. The AC unit was heavier than all the other models, and it had nearly slipped out of the window, but Rio caught it, jerking backwards in a panic.</p><p> 	A jagged corner of the aluminum faceplate dragged across Rio’s skin and tore a gash in her forearm, bright red blood immediately filling it, like a movie fading in on screen. </p><p>She dug around in her pockets for something to soak up the blood, and found a crumpled, scratchy paper towel. She pressed it to her forearm, holding it tight as she popped open the first aid kit she kept in the outer pocket of her utility bag. </p><p>	Rio hadn’t opened the kit in years, as evidenced by the three-year-old antibacterial ointment. She’d been careful until this year, apparently, recklessly careening through her life in more ways than one.</p><p>	She tore open a packet of alcohol wipes and cleaned the gash. Rio sucked in breath through her teeth, wincing at the sting of the alcohol, but it was a welcome distraction. Cutting a rectangle from a sheet of gauze, she covered her wound and then wrapped it with white medical tape. As Rio wiped the sweat from her brow and set the unit on a chair next to the window, she heard a rumble of steps racing up the stairs.</p><p>	There was an ominous sense of urgency in those steps, and they only grew louder and louder. </p><p>	Then, she heard her name. It was faint, but distinctive. It was undoubtedly her name that they were hollering.</p><p>	“Rio! Goddamn it, where the hell are you?” </p><p>	Rio stood up, tentatively listening as she poked her head into the living room of the apartment. </p><p>	“Rio!”</p><p>	The voice sounded familiar. She opened the front door. “Alice?” Watching as Alice whipped her head around and ran back, Rio stood in the doorway, bewildered. </p><p>	Alice looked a little disheveled: wearing two socks of different lengths, athletic shorts and a giant winter coat. </p><p>“I tried to call you but…” Alice caught a breath, her hands on her knees. “...your phone </p><p>kept going straight to voicemail.”</p><p>	“What are you doing here? How the hell did you find me anyhow?”</p><p>	Alice shook her head, waving her off. </p><p>	Rio glared at her. </p><p>	“Look, I’m off-duty, so I don’t know when this happened—I just heard, but the detectives paid Agatha a visit.”</p><p>	“They did?”</p><p>	“They took her to the station, and they’ve been questioning her for hours now. They’re holding her under suspicion.” </p><p>	A volcano of nerves exploded in Rio’s stomach and mushroomed into her chest, her throat constricting and her mouth tight with dryness. The police must’ve found out Agatha was at Rusty Hill shortly after they’d parted ways at the search. </p><p>	“They’re holding her under suspicion? They think she’s a suspect?” </p><p>	“They at least think she’s associated,” Alice said, her sharp brown eyes prodding Rio.</p><p>	“You don’t think she did this?” Rio asked, incredulously. She half-expected Alice to rationalize the detectives’ decision, based on Agatha’s reputation. </p><p>	“Look, if I learned my lesson, I know that you trust her, and that I jumped to conclusions on baseless accusations.”</p><p>	Rio asked Alice exactly what she had heard. What made the cops think Agatha was involved with Tommy’s disappearance?</p><p>	“They went through the CCTV footage and they saw her stumbling through the alleyway seven minutes before Tommy went through that same alleyway. Apparently, everyone else takes the alleyway on the other side of Rusty Hill.” </p><p>	Alice quipped, “Add that and her infamous relationship with the cops and the public, it’s no wonder they took her to the station.”</p><p>“So, what do you want to do?”</p><p>	Rio only had one idea. It was rash, foolish, and utterly driven by her misguided, pounding heart. </p><p> “I’m going to be her alibi.”</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio arrived at the police station alone; if she had arrived with Alice, it certainly would’ve raised eyebrows. She still had her dusty coveralls on, her work gloves poking out of her back pocket. </p><p>The police personnel took her into an interrogation room, where the fluorescent lighting cast a sickly white upon everything it touched. </p><p>It tinged Rio’s skin with a pale blue-green color. </p><p>There was one giant desk, originally painted white, the rusted metal underneath peeking through various spots on the surface. </p><p>	The floor was carpeted, and there were three metal chairs disparately spread throughout the room. Rio pulled up a seat at the side of the table and waited in the room silently.</p><p>	It had been ten agonizing minutes by the time the detectives came into the room. There was a Detective Leonia, a short blond man with angry skin and vengeful blue eyes. His stature did not match his round face, his knuckles jutting out like cubes. Then, there was also a Detective Annandale, a black woman of at least six feet height, with a serious yet open face, oblong and soft. Her hair fell in braids over her shoulders. </p><p>	They introduced themselves to Rio. Leonia shook her hand gruffly. Annandale didn’t shake her hand. </p><p>	“So, we heard that you wanted to provide some details about Agatha Harkness’s whereabouts on the night of Tommy’s disappearance,” Leonia said. He pulled up a folder with a stack of papers in it, and began scratching in a paper form. “Let’s start with your name, date of birth, and address.” </p><p>	For a few minutes, Rio gave the detectives her personal information, detailing her occupation, and why she moved to Westview. </p><p>	After learning where Rio had moved from, Leonia asked, “You like the Cubs, or what?”</p><p>	Rio reluctantly played along. “Hell, no. I was never a fan—half the reason why I moved.” </p><p>	“Right on,” Leonia rumbled. He was much friendlier than his appearance hinted. </p><p>	Annandale entered stage left, finally asking, “Alright, where were you the night of January 12th, Ms. Vidal?”</p><p>	“I finished my jobs around 8 PM, which was a little later than usual. That day, it was, uh…” Rio pulled out her phone and found the last invoice of that day, precisely around 8:06 PM. “A sink install and pipe-redo. It was a tough one. After that, I went home and had dinner, watched a movie. Agatha and I were planning to—meet—at my place, but she didn’t show.”</p><p>	Now that the lie had tumbled out, it was the truth. </p><p>	“What time was that?” Annandale asked.</p><p>	“Around 11 PM.”</p><p>	“And what is your relation to Agatha Harkness? Are you just having sex? Are you dating?” Annandale drilled into Rio immediately, with a gentle, lilt in her voice. The question ticked with the magnanimity of the situation.</p><p>	“That’s a complicated question,” Rio blurted out. “It’s kind of up in the air.”</p><p>	Annandale shot Rio a look of quiet exasperation.</p><p>	Leonia scribbled more notes down, pursing his lips. Rio couldn’t read him. His eyebrow seemed to be permanently furrowed and his mouth scrunched to the side. </p><p>	“Honestly,” Rio said, slowing her breath to calm herself down, “she’s embarrassed.”</p><p>	“Embarrassed?” Leonia asked. </p><p>	“Yeah, she told me she’d kick my ass if I told anyone we’d ever even slept together. She doesn’t want anyone to know we’re…having relations.”</p><p>	That seemed to satisfy Annandale. She moved on. She asked what occurred next.</p><p>	“So, she must’ve taken a cab. She ended up at my place and I just put her to bed.”</p><p>	“What time was that?”</p><p>	“Can’t have been later than 11:45.” </p><p>	Leonia asked, “Do you have anything that can corroborate this?”</p><p>	Rio reached into the breast pocket of her denim coat and, between her fingers, she showed the detectives Agatha’s concert ticket. “This fell out of her coat when she came to my house that night.” </p><p>	Neither of the detectives reacted to the ticket, but Rio could feel the tremors of uncertainty ricocheting over the table. </p><p>	Annandale took the ticket in a Ziploc bag. </p><p>	“And what about the morning after?” Leonia asked. </p><p>	“She left early for work.”</p><p>	“And you’ve been in contact with her since?”</p><p>	“No. She’s not exactly communicative,” Rio retorted. </p><p>	Annandale drove in the next question like a stake. “If you knew she was at Rusty Hill that night, why didn’t you alert the police immediately?”</p><p>“I didn’t think it was my place,” Rio said.</p><p>“I want to be clear, now, before we walk away. You do know that supplying us with false</p><p>information is a crime, yes?” Annandale bared her teeth, but she was perfectly calm and even. Her eyes lasered in on Rio, as if she were x-raying her, watching the frantic pulse of her heart and the sweat sprouting under her thighs. “You will be obstructing justice and you will be charged with a felony.”</p><p>But Annandale wouldn’t crack Rio.</p><p>	To her, this was a burst pipe, a sewer backup, a malfunctioning furnace. It wasn’t the end of the world, <em>if </em>Rio kept her cool. She could fix this, <em>if </em>she put a lid on the simmering pot of anxiety brewing in the pit of her core. </p><p>	“I know.” </p><p>	This <em>was </em>fucking crazy, though. Rio didn’t know that a person could <em>compel </em>her to lie to the cops and risk her own ass and livelihood like this. She had never considered carrying a felony for <em>Agatha Harkness</em>, the witch of Westview. </p><p>But Rio couldn’t <em>lie </em>to herself anymore: she loved her and would do anything to protect her. </p><p>	Leonia fixed his gaze on Rio, his eyes flicking up and down her face, like a lion spying on his prey.</p><p>The detectives stood up and pushed their seats in.</p><p>*	*	*</p><p>	An hour had gone by. Rio clasped her hands together and dug her thumbnails into the flesh between her thumb and index finger, imprinting it, over and over. She stood up and stretched, and then sat back down. </p><p>	The cops were probably watching her the entire time, hooking onto anything that would indicate a lie. Rio took a few deep breaths and forced herself to lean back into her seat. </p><p>	Had she made things worse?</p><p>	Was this just another fucking daft thing she had done?</p><p>	Why couldn’t she stay in her own lane?</p><p>	The door swung open. Annandale stood in the doorway with a folder clutched to her chest. “You’re free to go, Ms. Vidal.”</p><p>	“And what about Agatha?” Rio asked. </p><p>	Annandale exhaled ponderously, arching her shoulders back and then letting them drop like weights. “We still have a few things to corroborate.” </p><p>	Rio’s gut sank into the ground. </p><p>“How long are you going to keep her here?”</p><p>Squinting at her, Annandale put her hands on her hips. “Why are you so hellbent on her? We have reasonable suspicion to think that she had something to do with Tommy’s disappearance.”</p><p>“Because there’s no way she had anything to do with it. You and I both know that Westview has a personal vendetta against her. You are <em>wasting </em>your time on her while Tommy’s out there!” </p><p>Rio had rendered Detective Annandale speechless. It was an expression between shock, acknowledgment, and outrage, slack-jawed, mouth agape. </p><p>“You are <em>out of line</em>,” Annandale growled. </p><p>“She babysat those kids. Why the hell would she have anything to do with Tommy’s disappearance? It doesn’t make any fucking sense.” </p><p>“Watch yourself.”</p><p>It was an empty threat; it wasn’t a crime to speak out. Rio capitalized on it. </p><p>She continued, edging closer to Annandale, squaring up. “Look, I know that big-shot developer offered to renovate the department and all he wanted was Agatha’s land. She said no, and you guys didn’t get your renovation.” </p><p>Rio glowered, her lips thin with nuclear fury and disdain. “All of you held a grudge so greedily and so deeply—that you all are willing to burn through your resources while the Caplans lose countless nights of sleep <em>hoping </em>that you all are doing your best to find Tommy. They <em>trust </em>you to do your fucking jobs and here you are—putting on a prime-time performance, while they tirelessly search for their son.”</p><p>“Ms. Vidal, I’ve given you more than enough courtesy and I don’t take kindly to sweeping accusations about the department,” Annandale snapped. </p><p>“What I do find curious is that you and Agatha were the ones who found Tommy’s shirt and his vape,” she hissed, crossing her arms and taking a step forward, practically cornering Rio back into the interrogation room. </p><p>Nobody else had come through the hallway since, and it was eerily quiet. Only the buzz of the fluorescent lights accompanied the charged air between Rio and Annandale. </p><p>“So, prove it,” Rio taunted, staggering forward, jabbing with her finger. </p><p>She had never had the gall to speak to figures of authority like this, but for Agatha, she seemed to discover new things about herself constantly. </p><p>Something boiled under the surface of Annandale’s eyes, but she didn’t move a muscle, almost as if she was daring Rio to blink. </p><p>	Then, footsteps echoed in the hallway. Annandale turned. Detective Leonia and Alice appeared in the doorway. </p><p>	“Cab company was able to pull the clock for when they dropped off a very drunk and mean Harkness on the Witches’ Road. She was in that cab when Tommy disappeared, so it couldn’t have been her,” Leonia said. “We told her she was free to go.” </p><p>	Alice added, “I was also able to interview a few neighbors on the street. Phil Jones was up watching a baseball game and he said saw Agatha getting out of the cab.” She winked at Rio but kept her neutral expression, not letting on that they knew each other well.</p><p>	Annandale stepped aside to let Rio through. Almost inaudibly, she turned and whispered, “All this for a woman who could barely confess her affection for you.” </p><p>	Rio shook it off and sped through the police station to the front exit. She had to find Agatha.</p>

<p>Rio found Agatha standing on the curb, outside the police station. She shivered in the winter air, in light wash jeans and a thin gray sweater, clearly not expecting a visit from the cops. </p><p>	“Hi,” Rio said, her voice hoarse. Her heart skipped rope as she laid eyes on Agatha’s hair, tucked behind her ear. </p><p>	When Agatha turned, at first she glared, but then she glanced up and her icy expression melted into a warm look of gratitude. She flung her arms around Rio, her hand cradling the back of her head. Rio returned the favor, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s waist, burying her nose in her hair.</p><p>Agatha whispered in her ear. “The cops are watching us. What the <em>hell </em>did you say to them?”</p><p>	Rio pushed her tongue in her cheek. She wasn’t expecting a different reaction from Agatha, but of all the things she could have said first—this sure as hell wasn’t it. </p><p>	“Why don’t we talk about that later?” Rio untangled herself from Agatha. “Let’s go home.”</p><p>	Agatha narrowed her eyes at her, with a glint of disbelief.</p><p>	“Unless, of course, you don’t need a ride,” Rio cracked. She stepped off the curb and started to walk to her truck. “Night.”</p><p>	“Wait!” Agatha hollered, deepening her voice to cover up the whistle of appeasement underneath it. She jogged after Rio.</p><p>	Rio grabbed a stray winter coat laying in the backseat of her truck and tossed it to Agatha. “Here. You’re cold.” </p><p>	The ride balanced on a cable of silence, so tense it could snap at any moment. Rio held her tongue amidst the electric air, sparking every time she glanced over at Agatha. What was she thinking? </p><p>	Agatha broke first. “So, you told the cops that we’re…lovers?”</p><p>	“Well—not exactly,” Rio muttered. “Is that really what you’re stuck on?”</p><p>“You lied to them. You told them I came to your house drunk and you put me to sleep,” she iterated. “<em>Why</em>?” </p><p>	With both hands gripped on the steering wheel, Rio replied, “I know you didn’t do it. They’ve always had it out for you; of course they jumped at the chance to detain you.” </p><p>	“You lied <em>for </em>me?”</p><p>	“Yes.” </p><p>	Agatha gulped and leaned back in her seat. “I don’t know why you would do that for me.”</p><p>	When they arrived at the Witches’ Road, Agatha thanked Rio for the ride and then vanished into her house, still wearing her coat. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	The next evening, Agatha showed up on Rio’s doorstep. She was in a pair of barrel-legged blue jeans, white sweater, and a long black and white herringbone wool coat.  She held Rio’s coat out. “Hey. We’re going to Strega. Reservation’s in 45 minutes.” </p><p>	Rio had just finished her last job and she was still in her work clothes. Agatha was one of the last people she expected today, especially since she’d been making it abundantly clear that her affection and civility was for show.</p><p>But with her, it was always the games and back-and-forth, and she got on the ride nonetheless. Rio took the coat from Agatha. “Why are we going?”</p><p>	“I’m coming in,” Agatha said, peeping over her shoulder. Rio saw Dennis, watching as he shook a bin of mail. “God, gossip spreads like wildfire here.” </p><p>	Blocking the doorway, Rio insisted, “Again, I’m asking, what are you doing?”</p><p>	“We have to be seen together. Every single cop in Westview is looking for Tommy, but they’ve also got one eye on us,” Agatha said, brushing past her, an inch from her face. “It’s your lucky day, Vidal. I’m asking you out on a date.”</p><p>	“Wow,” Rio said, “how can I resist such an enthusiastic offer?” She rolled her eyes and closed the door behind her. </p><p>	“Hey, you’re the one who told the cops we were…encountering each other.” </p><p>	“Oh, you’re welcome, by the way,” Rio said, sarcastically.</p><p>	“I know you’re not gonna be seen with me in <em>that</em>,” Agatha said. “I’ll wait down here.”</p><p>	Rio went into her bathroom and stared at herself in the mirror for a long minute. This wasn’t a real date, but her body seemed to believe it was. Her stomach somersaulted, and her hands were clammy with sweat.  She slapped the hollows of her cheeks and grit her teeth, flexing her abdomen, as if she could overcome the butterflies hovering and fluttering inside. This was <em>not a real date</em>. </p><p>This was Agatha upholding her end of the bargain. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio changed into relaxed black jeans with a sweatshirt over a collared shirt and put her hair into a top knot. Strega was the type of restaurant where dressing in anything too formal made one stick out like a sore thumb. It was trendy, chic, and everyone wanted a reservation. </p><p>	“That’s better,” Agatha said, her eyes traveling up and down Rio.</p><p>	“I know.”</p><p>Agatha drove this time. Rio had never seen her car before, but when she got into the passenger’s seat, everything made sense.</p><p>	It was a shimmery, pear-colored Jaguar coupe, with bubbly, round lights and small, tight curves. The interior had been reupholstered: the seats a rich, tan faux-leather, the head-unit retrofitted with a respectable radio and CD player, the steering wheel and seat belts a matching rust orange. </p><p>“So, you’re a car aficionado?” Rio’s eyes wandered over to Agatha and then down to her vascular, angular hand, grappling the stick shift. She had resisted giving into her many surprises, but this was objectively <em>hot</em>.</p><p>Agatha put the clutch in and shifted up in quick succession, the car’s engine revving and roaring as she drifted onto the asphalt. She smirked. “Only for her,” she said, referring to the car. </p><p>“How’d you get this car? Must’ve cost a fucking fortune,” Rio mused.</p><p>“It would have, yes,” Agatha cooed. She shifted down as she hit a red light. “Let’s just say an estate sale went south.”</p><p>“A car like this doesn’t just go without a fight.” The car threw Rio back into her seat as Agatha accelerated into a turn. </p><p>“That’s why I had it painted green and the shape of the lights changed. The Montroses’ are still looking for a blue coupe,” Agatha said matter-of-factly. “Oh, and the registration is forged, obviously.” </p><p>Rio held onto the door rest as Agatha lurched into the bends of the road and blew through green lights. </p><p>Shortly after arriving at Strega, Rio got out of the car and walked alongside Agatha, getting in line at the host station, which snaked from the foyer to the front of the eatery. </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, glancing around at the newfound attention of the patrons whispering and turning toward them. It seemed as if every head was pointed at them, their eyes like homing missiles, following their every move.</p><p>Suddenly, Rio felt Agatha’s fingers grazing her leg and intertwining with her fingers. She was putting on a hell of a performance. And even though it was just that, Rio’s feelings were still real, smoldering under her skin. </p><p>At the front of the line, the host looked up and did a double-take, his eyes widening as soon as he realized he was speaking to Agatha. </p><p>“W-we have your table ready. Are you okay with a table ne-next to the window?”</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha said, haughtily. </p><p>“Is it a special occasion?” he asked, studying Rio as he grabbed two card stock menus. </p><p>“Can we just get our table?” Agatha pressed. </p><p>He conceded and led through the dining room, which was open and naturally lit, the </p><p>floors decorated with star-patterned tiles. Rio caught a barrage of whispers and low voices as she held onto Agatha’s hand, trailing behind her.</p><p>	“<em>Are they holding hands?</em>”</p><p>	“<em>That’s the new handywoman. Rumor has it, she’s been snaking Harkness’ drain for weeks, ever since she moved into her neighborhood</em>.”</p><p>	“<em>It’s just a fling</em>.” </p><p>	“<em>Agatha’s gonna eat her alive</em>.”</p><p>	“<em>Why are they dressed like they’re going to completely different places?</em>”</p><p>	Rio snorted to herself, getting a kick out of every unsolicited opinion, and sat down across from Agatha at the circular white table next to the window. </p><p>	She and Agatha locked eyes, the evening sunlight illuminating her blue eyes, sending shivers down Rio’s spine. She was once again treading uncharted waters, publicly on a date with the woman she’d fallen for. But she wrested the dregs of her grit, residing in the recesses of her chest. </p><p>	“Alright, so what’s our strategy here?” Rio asked, quelling the fire rumbling in her chest.</p><p>	“We should hold hands a few times during each course. Maybe share dessert? I don’t know, what would really sell it?” Agatha bit her bottom lip. “Should we play footsie?”</p><p>	“Ahem,” Rio grunted. “I meant for the meal.”</p><p>	“Oh.”</p><p>	“But, sure, we can do all of that, if you want,” Rio said, goading her with a sly grin. For someone so reluctant to date, Agatha certainly seemed eager with ideas. </p><p>	Rio scanned the menu. “One of us should get an app and one of us should get a salad. I, for one, love calamari and can’t say no to a salad with burrata in it.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, obeying silently, her mouth open, as if she was trying to find words. </p><p>“Great,” Rio said. “You like Chianti, right?”	</p><p>Agatha said yes. She folded a paper napkin on the table in various different shapes, as </p><p>Rio went through the menu. When she read aloud the pasta, Agatha interrupted. “No to the lemon paccheri and the mushroom risotto. Both of those are so boring.”</p><p>	“Is that so?” Rio kept her opinions to herself. She liked lemon pasta just fine and could never tire of eating mushroom risotto, but it would be a clumsy time to fight that battle. </p><p>	The server arrived at the table and introduced himself. His name was Dean, a young Korean man with a surfer’s tan and a sleeve of fine-line tattoos on his left arm. </p><p>Rio took charge, ordering for the two of them. </p><p>Dean wrote down the order and clicked his pen. “All great choices, my friends.” </p><p>“Is this what you’re always like when you go to restaurants?” Agatha inquired, running </p><p>her finger along the rim of her glass. She hadn’t sat still since they’d arrived. </p><p>	“No, this song and dance is all for you,” Rio teased.</p><p>	They both reached for the bread basket, their fingers touching. Agatha stuttered. Rio apologized, out of habit. </p><p>	“I will stab you in the hand for this bread,” Agatha said. Rio surrendered it and let her take it. “Maybe that’s why I can’t date; how would I get to eat all the bread I want?” </p><p>	It was adorable, the way she tore the bread into pieces and yet, still ended up with a wad in her cheek. </p><p>	“‘Can’t’? Or won’t?” Rio took a sip of wine. “If I was really dating you, I’d let you have all the bread.” Her ribs prickled when she remembered that she <em>had dated</em> Agatha for a split-second before she fucked everything up.</p><p>	“What about dessert? Will you let me choose?” </p><p>	“Preemptively? Before we’ve even seen the menu?” Rio deliberated. “I’ll let you choose this time.”</p><p>	“Okay, and hypothetically, if we have leftovers, how are we splitting them?” Agatha asked.</p><p>	“I’ll let you have the first pick of which entrée you want to take home,” Rio said. </p><p>	Agatha seemed satisfied at that. “Hypothetically, again, if we <em>had </em>to do this again, where would we go? Are you a planner?”</p><p>	Rio smiled at her line of questioning. It was genuine, and she eagerly leaned forward on her elbows, awaiting Rio’s answer. </p><p>	“There’s this great casual Thai place I like to stop by for lunch while I’m doing work on the east side. They’re fast, so no reservations,” Rio said. </p><p>	“Are you a comforter hog?” Agatha asked. </p><p>	Stuttering, Rio hesitated. “Well, I don’t need to sleep in your bed to—the cops aren’t going to see us—we don’t have to—”</p><p>	“Relax,” Agatha said, “I’m just curious. You seem like you might be one.”</p><p>Dean brought out the salad and small plate of calamari, with two additional plates. Rio </p><p>scooped some salad onto a smaller plate. </p><p>	The two of them critiqued the salad like pretentious assholes, punctuating each sentence with a calamari ring, dunked in a fresh, house-made marinara sauce.</p><p>	“You know, I want to learn to forgive. Vengeance is <em>so </em>hard on the body, but forgiveness has never served me,” Agatha said, during a lull in the conversation. </p><p>Rio’s stomach filled with lead. Even if Agatha wasn’t addressing her, she knew she was part of the reason why she found it hard to forgive. </p><p>Agatha continued. “I never even got close to letting anyone in, because there were always rumors swirling around. I was always an outsider, and I resented it until I had no choice but to embrace it.” </p><p>“I used to think it was all because of my mother—because of what a wretched person she was. She was <em>barely </em>a mother to me. But then, she was gone and I was here, carrying the torch.” </p><p>It was as if she was in a trance, staring out the window, her eyes glazed over, pensive and faraway. Given the last few weeks, Agatha never would’ve talked to Rio about something like this. </p><p>“I wish you could see yourself the way I see you,” Rio said. “I see someone resilient, fearless, and empathetic, against all odds.”</p><p>Before they could linger, Dean swooped in with a plate of rich amber egg ravioli and rainbow trout with butternut squash and fried sage. </p><p>Dinner gave Rio and Agatha plenty to talk about without circling back. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Agatha pulled up to the curb in front of Rio’s house and turned the ignition off. Rio didn’t expect her to walk her to the front door. </p><p>	She turned as she got out of the car and cocked an eyebrow. “Oh, full-service, huh?” The burnt bushes brought back the memory of the fire burning just a few nights ago. A lot had happened since then. </p><p>	“I don’t half-ass anything, Vidal.”</p><p>	Lone neighbors walked their dogs on the other side of the street, glancing over and taking peeks at them.</p><p>	When Rio reached the front door, she unlocked it and sheepishly said good night. </p><p>	“Wait,” Agatha said. </p><p>	Rio turned around and accidentally made uncomfortable eye-contact with a neighbor across the street. He quickly averted his gaze. “What is it?” </p><p>	“I still don’t understand why you lied to the cops for me,” Agatha said. “I’m not strong enough to sift through whatever it is you’re up to.”</p><p>	“I couldn’t let them go after you. They never would’ve stopped,” Rio said.</p><p>	“Look, I want to believe you. I want to trust you,” Agatha stressed. “But every time I’ve let someone in...”</p><p>	“I know. I’m sorry,” Rio said. “I know I had a part in that.” She leaned against her front door. “But I need you to know that I’ll never lie to you again. I’ll never betray your trust again and I regret every moment that I did.”</p><p>	Agatha looked her in the eyes, the abrasive edge of her pupils soft like water. </p><p>	“I’d do anything for you, Agatha. Because I care about you, because you’re still all I think of. There is no ulterior motive. I just care about you, and that’ll never change.” Rio couldn’t bear to look at her.</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Rio rambled on. “You don’t owe me anything. You don’t even have to react to what I just said. I just needed you to know, even if you don’t feel the same way. You can always come to me, anyway.” </p><p>	It was then that the crickets rang in the night, their chirps intensifying like the ring of a bell. </p><p align="center">*	*	*	</p><p> </p><p>	The next day, Rio tiled Mr. Lee’s bathroom shower and installed recessed shelves in a new restaurant. </p><p>She rushed home just as the sun was setting. It had been an unusually warm and sunny winter day, and the sky was a creamy orange. </p><p>	Rio grabbed the mail and then headed inside her house, taking off her boots and leaving them as they were, one clattered on its side, one pigeon-legged. She threw her coat over the couch and peeled off the top part of her coveralls. There was a knock at the door. </p><p>	“Oh. Hey,” Rio said, tying the coverall sleeves around her waist as she opened the door.</p><p>	“Sorry to show up unannounced, but I was nearby, so thought I’d stop by to tell you about some new developments,” Alice said. She was wearing her police uniform, clad with a bulky belt, which included a taser, baton, handcuffs, and industrial-strength pepper spray. </p><p>	“Is everything okay? Did you find Tommy?”</p><p>	“I can’t tell you more about those developments,” Alice said. “Whatever you’re doing to keep up the act with Agatha, keep doing that. The cops are not completely convinced you were telling the truth and they are watching.”</p><p>	“Christ,” Rio scoffed. “Shouldn’t they be, I don’t know, investigating real leads? Don’t you guys have limited resources right now?”</p><p>	Alice nodded, agreeing with her eyes. “They’ve been stewing ever since the Mephisto thing went down. Believe me, I know it’s a waste now.”	</p><p>	“They’re literally waiting for you guys to fuck up now. If you let the charade slip even a little—” she stopped and looked over her shoulder. She didn’t finish her sentence. “Just be careful.”</p><p>	After a moment, Rio asked, “Do you guys have <em>any </em>leads?”</p><p>	“I can’t say,” Alice replied. </p><p>	Rio persevered with an impatient glare.</p><p>	“Fine, fine. All I know is, the detectives pulled records on the Caplans and they never mentioned that Billy and Tommy were adopted. I don’t even think Billy or Tommy know.”</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio retired to her bedroom early, just half an hour after dinner. She paced in the dining room, trying to decide when she’d tell Agatha that they would need to plan more appearances. They would have to prove those hypothetical circumstances they’d bantered about last night. But she decided to turn in, instead. </p><p>There was always tomorrow, and she didn’t want to bother Agatha if she didn’t have to. She hadn’t reacted much after Rio gave her that rousing, clumsy speech; she’d blinked a few times, out of confusion, and then her bottom lip twitched, as if she was going to say something, but Rio couldn’t sit with the burning mortification inflating her chest, so she ended the night and slithered away. </p><p>Tonight, she’d just take the evening for herself to recoup and be alone with her thoughts.</p><p>Rio left the dishes in the kitchen sink and then turned the lights off, leaving only the hallway light on. </p><p>She took a long, unbothered shower, letting the hot water run on her back as she stood there, without a thought. The hot water stung her toes and made them tingle, the kind one could only feel in the bitingly cold winter air. </p><p>	She drew her fingers along the grout of the shower tile, observing the workmanship and reminding herself she’d need to clean it before winter’s end. Other than that, this house hadn’t called for much repair work; the landlord had been mostly pleasant, if a little too hands-off. But he always paid for Rio’s repair and maintenance work when she offered it. She couldn’t ask for a better deal.</p><p>	When her skin was searing clean, Rio got out of the shower and sealed her skin with a layer of lotion, and then threw on a forest green robe. She slid her feet into a pair of plush tan slippers and flung herself onto the bed, letting her legs hang off the end. Her spine made a dull popping noise and she closed her eyes.</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Jolting awake twenty minutes later, Rio rolled her head from side to side, her neck stiff. It had grown dark outside, and an unsettling quiet seeped into the bones of the house. </p><p>Her stomach gurgled as she dawdled in the closet, looking for a pair of broken-in sweats. She didn’t look for long, because the hunger got the best of her, gnawing at her ribs. </p><p>	Her eyes had adjusted to the dim lighting, so she didn’t bother turning any more lights as she strolled into the hallway and towards the living room. She grabbed her coat, still slumped over the couch, and hung it up in the hall closet adjacent to the front door. </p><p>It was then her peripheral vision picked up a blur. A dark mass in the dining room. Rio turned. Those sounds were unmistakable. </p><p>The <em>pat </em>of a treacherous footstep and <em>hiss </em>of an escaped breath.  </p><p>It was at moments like this that hesitation determined who became the predator and who became the prey. Rio seized her father’s knife from the work bag she’d dropped earlier that night. </p><p>She lunged forward, trapping the dark figure with her under her elbow, catching their </p><p>throat under her knife. Rio pressed her weight against the figure, her knee pinning the figure to the wall. </p><p>And then she inhaled the scent of lavender and pine. Her mind instantaneously recognized <em>who </em>was in her house, but her body had not caught up. The knife nicked the skin under it, drawing a thin stroke of blood to existence.</p>

<p>“What the <em>fuck </em>are you doing?” Rio barked, glowering at Agatha. </p><p>Her heart went haywire with adrenaline. Hand gripped around the handle of the knife, she stayed there, still pinning Agatha to the wall. Goosebumps broke out across her bare legs. A draft of air cooled the sweat on her chest, her robe barely covering everything.</p><p>“I guess you don’t like being watched either,” Agatha said, flashing a dangerous, unhinged smile. A blood bead rolled down her neck and hid in the collar of her black shirt. She was wearing all black, like a phantom of the night. </p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck?!” Rio finally let up. “How the hell did you get in here?” Her hands trembled as she imagined what she could’ve done to Agatha if she hadn’t realized it was her.</p><p>“You left your front door unlocked.” She panted as she got her bearings.</p><p>“<em>Why </em>are you here?”</p><p>Agatha suddenly shifted, grabbing Rio’s wrists and jerking her around, slamming her against the wall. “<em>You’re nothing but a fucking liar.</em>”	</p><p>Rio grunted. The knife tumbled out of her hand. “What the hell are you talking about?” </p><p>Agatha picked the knife up and felt the blood from her chin with one hand. Before Rio could seize the second to move, Agatha’s thumb jammed into the space under her clavicle, holding her against the wall. </p><p>She pointed the knife at Rio’s nose. “Enough,” she snarled. “You really almost got me, again.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Rio insisted, wrapping her hand around Agatha’s wrist, directing the knife elsewhere. “I’m not lying.”</p><p>“God,” she scoffed. “You’re not even trying to convince me now.” Her blue eyes cauterized Rio’s soul, simply pits of unadulterated disdain and rage. She absentmindedly let the knife wander, squarely on Rio’s sternum. “I <em>saw </em>you today. I saw you talking to Alice right on your fucking doorstep. I mean, come on, Vidal. Put your back into the role, why don’t you? Did you really think—”</p><p>	Rio took Agatha by the wrist, taking advantage of her theatrics, enduring a slice to her sternum in the commotion. She broke Agatha’s balance, pulling her in the direction she was leaning. </p><p>In a fluid and agile maneuver, Rio had Agatha facing the wall, her body pressed up against her. She couldn’t knock the knife away fast enough, so instead Rio held Agatha’s wrist down against the wall, both their arms outstretched. </p><p>	“I really wish you would call before you come over,” Rio huffed, her lips nearly touching Agatha’s neck. </p><p>	Agatha jabbed a shoulder back. Rio dodged. She drove her hand into Agatha’s shoulder, pressing her. “Maybe if you had even bothered to ask, I could have told you: she came to warn me that the cops aren’t buying our act. They are crawling everywhere, and they’re still watching us.” </p><p>	“Fuck you,” she groaned. “Why should I believe you, when you’re the one—” she strained against Rio. “—restraining me? Should I believe you under duress?”</p><p>	“Fine,” Rio said, exhaling. She let up on Agatha, staggering one step back. Her heart leapt into her throat. Her hands went numb and weak when her brain could finally catch up to the moment. <em>What the fuck was she doing?</em> <em>Why was there an unspoken respect in the way they pinned each other down?</em></p><p>“Rookie mistake,” Agatha jeered, whipping around with the knife. Rio surrendered with her hands up, directed against the wall once again. 	</p><p> “Is this part of the act? Giving in?” This time, Agatha brought the knife up and under Rio’s chin. “Since when are you and Alice talking again?”</p><p>“Look, since Tommy disappeared, we’ve put everything behind us,” Rio said. It sounded better in her head.</p><p>“Oh, <em>really</em>?” she said, through clenched teeth. She flexed her elbow and the knife imprinted in Rio’s skin, a pin of pressure would pierce it.</p><p>Rio curled her fingers around Agatha’s wrist, wriggling under the knife, trying to gain an inch. “Alice was the one who corroborated your alibi.” </p><p>	There was a flare of surprise in her eyes. “If you were talking to her again, why didn’t you come to me sooner?”</p><p>	“I didn’t want to bother you. She wasn’t causing you any harm,” Rio said. “You didn’t want anything to do with me.”</p><p>	“Still don’t,” she shot back.</p><p>	“I don’t know,” Rio contended, “you’re in my house right now. Now it seems like you can’t stay away.”</p><p>	Agatha narrowed her eyes, like a camera lens focusing on its subject. She let the knife slip suddenly, the blade sliced into Rio’s clavicle.</p><p>	She winced. “<em>Fuck!</em>” She didn’t expect Agatha to <em>literally </em>cut her. </p><p>Rio kneed her off her body and tore the knife from her grip. Then, all hell broke loose. </p><p>Agatha tackled Rio by the knees and Rio crumpled, falling on her back, and the two of them struggled for the knife, which had clattered somewhere near the entrance of the dining room. Their bones thudded against the floor, elbows and knees clomping and clunking. </p><p>	Agatha crawled on her elbows, stretching forward, finding the knife once again. Rio flipped onto her stomach and flung herself over Agatha’s back, slapping the knife away, out of sight. Agatha threw an elbow, squarely landing in Rio’s chest, and once again she ended up on her back, the air knocked out of her lungs. </p><p>	Thankfully, the robe managed to keep all of Rio inside of it in the madness.</p><p>	And then suddenly, Agatha was straddling her, hand gripped around her throat, looming over her. Her thumb pressed on Rio’s bleeding clavicle. Her other hand held Rio’s arm down above her head. </p><p>It should’ve made her angry, but being crushed under her was exhilarating. Rio’s stomach fluttered, like a flock of doves unleashed. </p><p><em>No, not this again</em>. She throbbed between the legs, only separated from reality by the thin polyester of her robe. She swallowed and braced herself. </p><p>	They stared at each other in the dark, like they had, many times before. The air had transformed into something heavier, something different. Electricity charged through the animosity between them, vaporizing it. </p><p>	“You didn’t think I would, did you?” Agatha breathed, smirking down on Rio.</p><p>	“You know what I think? I think you can’t help that you want me,” Rio said. “That’s why you’re still here.”</p><p>	Agatha’s fingers tightened around Rio’s throat. “You’re not in any position to taunt me.”</p><p>	Rio grasped onto Agatha’s wrist. “You trust me. You’ve forgiven me. But you’re scared because you don’t know what it means.” </p><p>“You really think you know me, don’t you?” Agatha clenched her jaw, in lockstep with her fingers, tensing still. “I don’t think about you. I haven’t thought about you.” She leaned back, letting go of Rio’s wrist and her throat. 			</p><p>Rio caught Agatha’s eyes wandering beyond her clavicle, down at a sliver of skin in between her breasts. “You’d crumple in a court of law.” </p><p> Agatha’s eyes flicked back up, full of denial.</p><p>“I slept with someone last night,” Agatha betrayed.</p><p>Rio couldn’t mask her shock fast enough. </p><p>“Still think I want you?”</p><p>Collecting the pieces of her resolve back, Rio sniped her with a roguish look. “You want to hurt me by saying that, but guess what? I’m not. In fact, you had every right. I want you to be happy.”</p><p>“Then I guess you won’t mind me describing every last detail.”</p><p>“Bring it on,” Rio cooed.</p><p>“She was delicious,” Agatha teased.</p><p>“Was she?” Rio’s fingers grazed the sides of Agatha’s thighs and she all but saw the electricity reverberating through her veins. This was a <em>turn-on</em> for Agatha; she was enjoying herself, and that was all Rio wanted for her. She cast a line out and reeled her in.</p><p>“Like cherries.”</p><p>“So, did you take her?” Rio asked, the tips of her fingertips drawing the tops of Agatha’s thighs. </p><p>“You’re not strong enough for this,” Agatha warned. </p><p>“You’re not strong enough to stop. You’re <em>loving </em>every second of this. And you want me to know, while I’m pinned under you, while I’m—indisposed.”</p><p>“I suppose we could even the playing field.” </p><p>“So, is this just how we deal with things now?” Rio asked, squirming under her. She could not resist indulging when Agatha offered herself. </p><p>“Do you have a better idea?”</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	Rio went into her closet and strapped on an extension of herself, and then tied the robe closed. </p><p>When she came out, Agatha shoved her backwards and Rio fell onto the unmade, napped-in bed, which she’d expected to crawl into alone this evening.</p><p>Clinging to the crags in the maelstrom of her desire for Agatha, Rio bit her bottom lip. She could not give in like she did last time. She had to find her footing, to claw her way up the crag. </p><p>	“Take it off,” Agatha demanded, already stripped down to her skivvies. </p><p>	On her elbows, Rio slung back, “You first.” </p><p>	“Your funeral.” Agatha climbed onto Rio, straddling her again, unclasping her bra and letting it fall to the side. She left her underwear on. She unfurled her fingers on the left side of Rio’s chest and planted her other hand on the right side of her head. </p><p>	“Let me guess,” Rio said, taking the reins. “You took her last night, like this,” she said, curling her fingers around Agatha’s hips, her thumbs sinking into the curve of her skin. “And she was practically begging for you,” she whispered, close to her ear. “I mean, who could blame her? It’s <em>you</em>.”</p><p>“So you slid yourself inside her,” she continued, shifting under Agatha, rolling her hips. She fastened her stare on Agatha, compelling her to stay with her. </p><p>Rio grunted as she pressed against Agatha’s desire, hot wetness spreading inside of her. “You fucked her at whatever seedy dive you like to haunt, <em>desperately</em>—”</p><p>	She rocked her hips under Agatha, rhythmically, one hand holding onto her hips, one hand wandering up the soft skin of her abdomen. </p><p>	Agatha moaned, now wholly mesmerized, from head to toe.</p><p>	“<em>Recklessly</em>—” Rio continued, her hand enclosing Agatha’s breast, her fingers caressing her nipple. </p><p>	Agatha shuddered in Rio’s hand, and she ground down on her, meeting her.  </p><p>	“<em>Breathlessly</em>—” </p><p>	Rio sat up, chest-to-chest with Agatha, her mouth closing around her nipple. Her tongue flitted across, teasing her, coaxing her out of the shell she’d calcified. </p><p>	She erupted with another moan, holding onto Rio, grinding against her body, against her strap-on.</p><p>	“And, <em>unsuccessfully</em>,” Rio needled, halting all movement, sitting back, away from Agatha. </p><p>	Agatha gulped. Her chest flushed a strawberry red shade. “Quit fucking around, can we just—” Unable to finish her words, she pulled the tie of Rio’s robe. </p><p>	“Ah,” Rio hissed, slapping away her hand. “What was it that you wanted? A <em>warm </em>body?”</p><p>	Agatha’s lips curled out, as if she’d teleported back to the memory of that night, between surprise and annoyance.</p><p>	“Well, I’m not your warm body tonight,” Rio snarled. Before Agatha could gain any ground, she brought her right back to the edge, her thumb rubbing circles over her underwear, over the softest part of her. </p><p>	Agatha gasped. “What do you want me to say?” She bit her bottom lip and pushed herself into Rio’s touch. “Whatever convinces you,” she muttered.</p><p>	Rio stopped again. </p><p>	“Fine, fine,” Agatha panted, slinking her underwear off her right ankle. “Just tell me what you want me to say.” She was wet, and she was perfect. </p><p>	“Oh, no, no,” Rio said, biting her tongue to keep herself strong. “You tell me what you want, and you have to mean it.”</p><p>Agatha contemplated it for a split-second, blowing a truss of hair from her face, and then groaned. “You wish. I’ll just finish myself off.” She readjusted herself, tensing her legs around Rio, her fingers caressing herself with a lively and lithe cadence. “Oh, doesn’t it just kill you?” She put one hand on Rio’s chest, groaning as she rocked her hips against her fingers. </p><p>Rio entertained it, watching Agatha pleasure herself, approaching the precipice. And then she grabbed Agatha’s wrist, and brought her fingers into her warm mouth, tasting her. She could <em>feel </em>Agatha’s heartbeat racing through her wrist, the time and space between brewing into something transcendent. </p><p>Agatha had not expected it, and she watched Rio, as if she were out of her own body, her lips parted with an unabashed curiosity.</p><p>Without words, Agatha begged and Rio held the line. She released Agatha’s hand.</p><p>	Pulling her robe apart, Rio finally revealed herself and Agatha’s eyes met her body. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio started, “I don’t care about what you did last night.” She held the strap-on with her left hand, adjusting herself under Agatha. “I don’t care…” she said, her voice falling into a whisper. She slid herself against Agatha’s wet desire, slipping up and down. “...that she took you in, that she got to enjoy you, that—”</p><p>	Agatha closed her eyes and a moan escaped from her trembling lips. She pressed the tip of Rio inside of her.</p><p>	Rio stopped her. “Not so fast,” she said, taking herself back in her hand. “I want you and only you, and I’ll give you everything you want, but you have to tell me what you want.”</p><p>	Agatha groaned. “You know what I want.” </p><p>	“I know you’re <em>baring </em>it all, but I can’t read your mind,” Rio retorted. She taunted Agatha with a smirk as she grabbed her hip and pushed herself against her. “My intentions are clear, but maybe I’m wrong. Maybe you really don’t think about me.” She pulled back again and absorbed the sparkle of Agatha’s blue eyes, edging on complete collapse. </p><p>	“You’re diabolical!” Agatha exclaimed. </p><p>“We can call it a night, if you want,” Rio said. She grunted, tipping Agatha to one side, ready to unweave from her legs. </p><p>“Wait, wait, wait. Hold on,” Agatha blurted, weighing down on Rio. “I can do this.” She sucked in her bottom lip, her breath ragged and uneven. </p><p>	“Can you?”</p><p>	“I…would like to continue,” she mustered. It was the most polite she’d ever been with Rio. </p><p>“Well, I’m here, aren’t I?” Rio slid herself against Agatha, her wetness taking liberty of where she glided. “Can you elaborate? Do you want to continue <em>with me</em>?” She sunk into her, ever so slightly. “Or with a stranger?” She pulled out. </p><p>“With…<em>you</em>,” Agatha whispered, barely able to speak. </p><p>Hearing her say it out loud melted Rio to her bones. To bask in the light of her undiluted affection and thirst for her was the crux of the universe at this moment. She could let herself indulge now; she could cave and surrender her body to Agatha now. </p><p>But she held onto her cards. “Tell me how you want to continue.” She gazed up at Agatha, caressing her forearm. </p><p>“I…just need you,” Agatha said. “I need you to—” </p><p>Rio rolled her hips, suddenly starving for more. She wanted nothing more than to give every ounce of her energy to Agatha’s pleasure.</p><p>She placed her hands on her hips and Agatha's hands took residence on top of them, tautening as she found her words again.</p><p>“I <em>want </em>you,” she groaned. “Fuck, is that what you want? I want you right now.” </p><p>Rio smirked at her again, gliding inside her, just an inch. “Like this?”</p><p>	An uncharacteristic whimper sprung from Agatha’s lips. “Just like that.”</p><p>	“Do you want more of me?” Rio couldn’t resist her own carnal desires any longer. She held onto Agatha’s hips. This was the performance of a lifetime for her. </p><p>	“I want all of you,” Agatha said. </p><p>	She had all but melted in the palm of Rio’s hand, baring her soul. Rio eased into Agatha, moaning alongside her. </p><p>She took Agatha’s hand and kissed it, and then planted it on her chest. “Do you think about me?” she asked, her voice like a ghost in her chest, as she rolled her hips, sending Agatha into space. </p><p>	“No.” Agatha put her other hand on Rio’s chest, her index finger resting on her clavicle. She sank onto Rio, pushing her weight onto her chest, stabilizing herself. </p><p>	Rio blinked.</p><p>	“I think about you, all the fucking time,” Agatha said. “I wished it was you last night.” </p><p>	Rio’s heart pounded against her ribcage, threatening to launch through, her blood rushing to her extremities. She never thought she’d hear such a confession from Agatha, but here she was, unfolding. </p><p>Rio echoed her moans, watching the pleasure wreaked upon her face, thrusting into her, completing her, again and again. </p><p>“Good <em>God, </em>Rio,” Agatha said. “I’m so close, I’m so <em>close</em>.” </p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>Warm wetness painted Rio’s inner thighs and Agatha received her, riding her hard, losing herself. </p><p>“Come for me,” Rio said, keeping pace, bringing her hips down.  </p><p>Agatha's thighs suddenly clenched around Rio’s hips, and her hands tensed on Rio’s breasts. “<em>Fuck</em>.” She slowed, her muscles slackening. Rio sat up, meeting her at the chest. Agatha kissed her, softly and passionately, caressing her cheek, fingers intertwined in her hair. </p><p>Rio moaned into Agatha’s mouth, still inside of her, bucking her hips steadily. The dam had burst open and she couldn’t get enough of her. Adrenaline stabbed her in the stomach, and she only wanted to chase her craving. </p><p>She thrust her hips, sinking into Agatha, and she enthusiastically harmonized with her rhythm. They frantically moved as one, writhing, sprinting towards the finish line together again, as if everything would go dark in seconds.</p><p>Rio let herself fall, indulging in a lightning flash of the future: that she would soon enough be in her arms again, night after night. </p><p>“You wanna do this again, sometime soon?” Rio asked, panting in rhythm with Agatha, locking eyes, like a bridge between their unspoken ruminations. </p><p>“Shut up.” She growled, draping her arms around Rio’s shoulders as she took her, uninhibited and bare. </p><p>Rio kissed her and held her hips, holding her there to bring her to the next cliff of pleasure. “You could ruin me,” she muttered, as if the words were drawn from the depths of her psyche. </p><p>“<em>Oh, fuck</em>,” Agatha cried. She grasped onto Rio’s shoulders, spasming on top of her, thighs sandwiching her hips, frozen for a second. And then, she went limp. “<em>Jesus fucking Christ</em>.”</p><p>Agatha disengaged from Rio, flopping over and landing next to her on the bed. </p><p>Rio’s sight panned up to the ceiling. Sweat sparkled on her tan skin, between her breasts, catching the light of the pink salt lamp on the nightstand. They laid next to each other in quiet, brain-melting post-coital bliss, chests heaving, knuckles brushing. Rio tickled Agatha’s palm with the tips of her fingers, turning towards her. </p><p>Agatha peered at her softly, and purely, with a hint of a smile on her lips </p><p>Clarity had settled upon Rio and she suddenly had the urge to unravel all the feelings and thoughts she’d entombed up until this very second. “Listen, I’d be happy to do this again. But just for the record, in case anything happens, I just want you to know that I—”</p><p>“H-hold on,” Agatha said, sitting up and scooting to the edge of the bed. “Just…don’t say anything yet.” </p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha gathered her clothes. “Before you say whatever it is you wanted to say, I have to show you something.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, clutching the sheets to her chest. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>“I don’t want you to say something you’ll take back before we go to my house,” Agatha said. “Come on.” </p><p>She held her hand out.</p>

<p>	Rio cleaned herself up and got dressed and then she followed Agatha out of the house. </p><p>She trailed behind Agatha, silently, to her house and then into her backyard. She didn’t know what would happen next, but she trusted her.</p><p>	“What are we doing?” Rio asked. </p><p>	She hadn’t seen her backyard since the start of winter, and this time felt distinctly intimate. This time Agatha had invited her, with an outstretched arm, reaching for her. </p><p>The grass was patchy in some places, frost-kissed and brittle, but the field of weeds and wildflowers loomed, billowing in the night breeze. The air smelled faintly of smoke and burning wood, the scent caught in the cold, swirling in slow-motion.</p><p>Agatha led Rio through the field, fingers still intertwined, until she came upon the opening where the pile of stones and dead flowers awaited. It was a haunting and familiar sight. </p><p>Rio stood behind Agatha, facing her back, not knowing what to expect next. Finally, she turned around and Rio stepped back. </p><p>“I’m going to tell you something,” she said. “I want you to know before you say anything else.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said softly. Her heart pounded in her ears like a kick drum tearing through her nervous system, because there was so little standing in the way of telling Agatha that she loved her. She wanted to, but instead, she listened.</p><p>“About fifteen years ago, Nicky and I moved into this house. It was a really hot and humid summer. There were cicadas out all the time and it was so loud, and I remember hating the sound so much that I’d keep a record on the whole day just to drown it out. Nicky enjoyed the cicadas, though. He’d bring one inside to show me—”</p><p>She shuddered.</p><p>“—so gross. We enjoyed a few peaceful weeks here, just me and him, going out on the town, going to the art museum and the science center. I didn’t really know anyone here and school enrollment hadn’t started, so nobody <em>remembers </em>him. There wasn’t much in the way of record-keeping then, and there still isn’t. Nobody knows his name and nobody knows he exists.”</p><p>Agatha held onto her elbows, tugging at her wool coat, her gaze focused on the middle distance. </p><p>“You don’t have to tell me,” Rio interjected. </p><p>“I want to. I can’t let this go on without telling you,” she replied. </p><p>Rio accepted her, imploring her to continue. </p><p>“One night we went out for ice cream and I put him to bed. The next morning, he didn’t wake up.” Her voice broke, and she shrunk into herself.  </p><p>The portentous shadow of her notoriety suddenly dissolved before Rio.</p><p>Agatha had never fit the mold that the public eye had bestowed upon her: she was a person who had lost her child. </p><p>She was raw with the grief that had grown around her, unrelenting, alone, and cold. She was unashamed in her grief, displaying like a coat of armor, but the town had mistaken it for displaced rage and bitterness.</p><p>Rio held her silently, knowing no words of comfort could touch her devastation in any meaningful way, absorbing her grief and consuming it with her. </p><p>“I never told anyone that he died,” Agatha managed. She pulled away from Rio and her gaze fell upon the stones. “He only existed to me.” </p><p>She gulped and said, “I couldn’t let the town take him away.”</p><p>At first, Rio didn’t understand. She looked at the stones and then back into Agatha’s red-rimmed blue eyes. </p><p>“I buried him here, Rio,” Agatha confessed, her voice no stronger than a creak. </p><p>The truth toppled upon Rio, crashing into her skull and then cascading through her soul. She observed the stones and they stared back, undoubtedly set in the same places they’d been almost fifteen years ago. They had stayed there, just as Nicky had stayed, just as he remained a child. </p><p>“I chose to curse myself…” Agatha said. </p><p>“To keep him,” Rio answered. </p><p>“I still see his face every night before I fall asleep.” She crouched down and took a dried dandelion from the stone, rolling the stem between her fingers. “I will carry these stones and his memory until I become part of the land.” </p><p>Rio cradled Agatha’s hand, forging an irreversible connection. She met her eyes and said, “You don’t have to carry them alone.”</p><p>Agatha pierced her with a devastating, resolute gaze. “I love you, Rio. I’ve fallen in love with you, but I’m terrified and I’ve told myself that it’ll never work. My first instinct is to run, but I’m resisting it—I’m telling you everything now so you have the chance to walk away.” </p><p>“Hasn’t it been abundantly clear that I’m completely and hopelessly in love with you?” Rio asked. “I’m not walking away.”</p><p>Her heartbeat had been vibrating around in her chest cavity, but then it rang with tenacity, connecting to the marrow of her bones. The fabric of her life had woven itself tightly into a clear, strong pattern. “Your secret is my secret now, Agatha. I <em>love </em>you.” </p><p>Rio caressed her cheek and then pulled her into a kiss that she wished would never end, reaching for one another in the dark, jumping off the cliff together, to explore their newfound story. Their tongues proposed to one another in soft, long kisses. </p><p>Agatha held onto Rio’s wrist, as if relief had washed over her, finding the same path to walk on beneath the milky twilight. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	That night, Rio slept in Agatha’s bed, but this time it felt more permanent, as if the left side of the bed had become her rightful place. </p><p>	The next morning, she ripped herself from slumber, suddenly remembering that the woman she loved was sleeping next to her, without pretense. Rio nuzzled into her neck, unable to resist her soft, pale skin. </p><p>Agatha wrapped her arm around Rio and flashed her a sleepy, sweet smile. It was a private, esoteric smile, exchanged only between lovers, rooted into the ground together, real and bare. There were no illusions now, the intertwining of their futures was inevitable. </p><p>	This was the first time Rio knew how certainty felt; it was a singular, centered foundation in her core, tethered to the soil of the Earth. She’d settled in Westview, running from herself, only to discover that the way through was to surrender, to immerse herself in the kaleidoscope of humanity that shook her to her bones. She had wondered that after what she had done to Evette, she would come to the conclusion that it would <em>always </em>end the same way: that she would never find out what certainty felt like. </p><p>Then it was when she stumbled onto the same road as Agatha Harkness, that she magically had the choice to continue running, or to give herself to someone. She chose her, and she would always choose her. </p><p>	Agatha moaned quietly, steadily waking, her blue eyes blinking open. </p><p>	“Morning,” Rio hummed. She kissed her, because she was right there, right in front of her. She caressed Agatha’s chin. </p><p>	“Rio,” Agatha said, between kisses, the tips of her fingers tickling her upper back, “what do your finances look like?”</p><p> <em>Record-scratch</em>. Rio broke from the kiss and put her hand on Agatha’s sternum, looking up at her. “I’m sorry, what?”</p><p>	“What are you working with? A Roth IRA? 401K? SEP? 403B? HSA and cash you keep hidden somewhere?” Her voice dropped to a whisper at the last part.</p><p>	“Is this foreplay that I’m not getting?” Rio rubbed the sleepy dust from her eyes. Perhaps she <em>was </em>still dreaming. Señor Scratchy suddenly landed on the bed, whisking his tale from side to side as he eyed Rio. There was a shimmer of acknowledgment in his grassy, green eyes, and he headbutted her calf. She pet the top of his head with her fingers, enamored by him.</p><p>	The two continued the conversation as they heaved themselves out of bed, crammed in Agatha’s walk-in closet. </p><p>	“I just don’t see the point in beating around the bush,” Agatha explained, flipping through shirts, dressed in her underwear. “Look, I know what I want and I don’t care that this is unhinged. If we’re diving into this thing, I need to get to logistics. I need to know who you are, financially.” </p><p>	Rio chose a pair of black sweatpants and threw on a t-shirt with a long flannel. The sweatpants were nearly a perfect fit; the utilitarian in her grinned from ear to ear. Sharing clothes would be a game changer. </p><p>	“This could be hot if I let it be. I have <em>healthy</em> retirement accounts,” Rio offered. </p><p>	Agatha made a noise of approval and hopped into a pair of olive green pants. “You have any loans I should know about?”</p><p>	“Trade school was affordable,” Rio said.</p><p>	“Medical bills?” Agatha asked, pausing for a second, deliberating. “Business loans?”</p><p>	Rio shook her head. “Okay, nosey neighbor, what about you? Are you vested at your unnamed, obscure corporate job?”</p><p>	Agatha put on a shirt and buttoned it. She whispered in Rio’s ear. “Yes, and I may or may not have skimmed 10% of every department’s budget.” </p><p>	“You couldn’t wait to tell me, could you?” Rio kissed her on the cheek. </p><p>	They continued the conversation over bagels at the dining room table. Agatha tore into her sesame bagel, cream cheese on her upper lip. “Are you a morning or night showerer?” </p><p>	“Night. You’ve seen me after work, I’m filthy.” Rio giggled at her gusto and her immediate lack of reservation after insisting that she didn’t know how to proceed in a relationship. “When are your laundry days?”</p><p>	Agatha glanced at her with a furrowed brow. “Thursdays and Saturdays. Are you going to be doing your laundry here?”</p><p>	“Maybe I’ll be spending enough time here that I might have to,” Rio said. “But also, the dryer at my house is old as shit and I hate it.” </p><p>	“I never remember to move the clothes to the dryer,” Agatha said.</p><p>	“I can do that.” </p><p>	After breakfast, they went their separate ways, off to work. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	Rio started her day at the hardware store, picking up copper couplings, light switches, and three bags of cement. It was a day that would start out with smaller, handier work, and then she’d be redoing someone’s deck for the spring. It was too early, but the man who’d requested the work was willing to pay a bit more. </p><p>	She was barely able to make it past the counter before Lilia loudly proclaimed, “So, what’s it like, dating the witch of Westview?” </p><p>	A few customers poked their heads out from the aisles, swiveling to stare at Lilia and then at Rio.</p><p>	“Jesus, Lilia,” she said, closing in on the counter and shielding her face with a hand over her brow. </p><p>	“Well,” Lilia said, leaning in close and quieting down. “Is it true? Are you really dating that devil? Or is this a terrible cry for help and you don’t know how to get out of the lie?”</p><p>	Rio rolled her eyes. “Oh, I’m dating the devil.” </p><p>	“<em>How </em>did that happen? When the hell did that happen?” Lilia bagged her light switches and couplings into two separate paper bags.</p><p>	“Last night,” Rio said with a blasé gleam in her dark eyes. </p><p>	Lilia grimaced at her. </p><p>	“This is different, Lilia. I’m certain about her,” Rio said. It sounded trite and juvenile, but she wasn’t afraid to be earnest. “And I know you don’t trust her, but I do. Don’t believe all the rumors, because that’s just what they are. They’re rumors.”</p><p>	“I’m just cautious, is all.” Lilia tapped a few keys on the register keyboard, pushing her glasses up her nose. She cleared her throat. “When can we sit down and really get to know her?”</p><p>	“Does everything move at warp speed here, or is it just me?” </p><p>“I’m not suggesting anything crazy, I just want to know who she is as a person,” Lilia. </p><p>“She likes mid-century modern furniture, she likes bad music at dive bars, and she’s really into Mediterranean food. There, she’s a normal person with interests and a life outside of maintaining her witchy reputation,” Rio said. </p><p>She imagined what it would be like, with her friends at one side of a diner booth and Rio and Agatha on the other side, fielding ridiculous questions like it was a press conference. Alice would ask leading questions about her criminal records. Jen would simply resort to trendy and unfortunately hilarious insults. Lilia would ask invasive, personal questions. And Billy would be respectful.</p><p>Agatha would not handle it well or gracefully, and Rio would have to rein in both sides.</p><p>She deflected the conversation, until another customer got into the checkout line. She didn’t want to have to convince her friends that Agatha deserved a second chance. The ground beneath her was finally reforming on a fragile surface of water, teetering on a fulcrum of equilibrium. </p><p>She didn’t want to deal with the labor of mending the bridge between Agatha and her friends. Some things took time.</p><p>Rio took the bags from Lilia and pulled the truck around the back of the building to load it up. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	That evening, after work, Rio cleaned up and met Agatha at the night winter market at the town square. Heat lamps lit and warmed the perimeter of the market, providing a comforting wash of light. </p><p>Rio wore her blue corduroy baseball cap and held Agatha’s hand as they wandered through a maze of gift and housewares vendors. One sold cutting boards and other wooden kitchenware, one sold Westview hats and socks, and another sold prints, bags, candles, and soap. </p><p>	Rio could feel the stinging stares and glances all over her, watching her with Agatha. Eventually, though, the wave of glances petered out and they blended into the crowd. They stopped by a vendor that sold a variety of decor: small vases, table-sized sculptures, square-framed paintings, and rustic-looking kitchenware. </p><p>	The vendor was a tall woman in a slouchy beanie who did a double-take when she saw Rio and then Agatha. “Welcome,” she stammered. “Our cheese knives are twenty percent off tonight.” </p><p>	Agatha didn’t respond. Rio cleared her throat and smiled politely at the vendor.</p><p>“Do you really need cheese knives?” Rio asked, picking up a pronged knife. “Have we gotten too specialized as a society?”</p><p>	“Don’t be ridiculous,” Agatha said. “You <em>need </em>a pronged knife for hard cheeses. Would you rather make a fool of yourself with a <em>fork</em>?”</p><p>	Rio shrugged. “And what about this?” She twirled a tiny cheese spreader between her fingers. “What’s wrong with using a butter knife?”</p><p>	“You need a knife small and light enough to spread cheese across a scrumptious, brittle, rosemary cracker. Don’t you hate it when the cracker breaks under the weight of a comically large butter knife?”</p><p>	“Doesn’t bother me.”</p><p>	“Rio, love,” Agatha said, caressing her cheek, uncharacteristically affectionate in public, “you don’t have to live like that anymore.” </p><p>	Rio smiled at her, captivated by her honest, blunt blue eyes. She was breathtaking, and the cacophony of the market blurred. </p><p>	Agatha chose a handful of cheese knives and Rio took them up to the checkout table, which was set up next to the handmade soap display. </p><p>	“I love these knives,” the vendor said, wrapping them in a mushroom-colored canvas cloth.</p><p>	“The workmanship on those handles is amazing,” Agatha remarked absentmindedly.</p><p>	The vendor thanked her, still bashfully eyeing her, seemingly stunned by how <em>normal </em>she was. She could be curt, certainly, but Rio had grown to love how unpredictably moody she was sometimes. It was just who Agatha was.</p><p>	Rio held the bag and leaned against Agatha as they inched through the art booths, fingers locked together. The way they moved around one another was so natural, as if they had both been waiting to fall into place. </p><p>	The crowd broke off into disparate lines when they got to the food vendors. People shuffled through the lines, music boomed through speakers, and the aroma of beer, butter, and garlic made Rio’s mouth water. She surveyed the selection of food and drink with Agatha, scanning through menus and deliberating between tacos and musubi. </p><p>	They decided on the last booth, where people swarmed in four separate lines. When Rio arrived at the front of the line, she looked up and saw Jen staring back at her. </p><p>	“This is new,” Jen commented, immediately clocking Agatha over Rio’s shoulder. </p><p>	“Hello, Jen,” Agatha said. </p><p>	“You never paid your tab at the bar,” Jen said, crossing her arms. </p><p>	“Oh, boy,” Rio muttered. </p><p>	“Right,” Agatha said, on her best behavior. “Charge it to my card.” She flashed a witchy smile and handed Jen a credit card. </p><p>	Jen snatched the card. “Out of all the eligible people in Westview…” </p><p>	“You’ll get used to it,” Rio retorted. </p><p>	Pivoting, Jen handed them a flat disc that would vibrate when their order was ready. “Time will tell. Anyway, we’re gonna meet at Lilia’s house this Saturday. There are new developments I can’t talk about right now.” </p><p>	Rio’s heart stretched, tying itself into a knot when she thought of Billy, still hanging in limbo. She nodded and ushered Agatha out of the line with her. </p><p>	Suddenly, a man bumped and jostled through the line and pointed at Agatha. </p><p>	“Is it true? Do you have gold or something buried in your backyard?” </p><p>	Agatha glared at him, and Rio stepped in front of her, putting her hand out to distance the man. </p><p>	He continued, jabbing his finger at her. “The police said they have a ransom note that you’re not paying. You’re the one standing in the way of Tommy Caplan coming home.”</p><p>	Other people started to look their way, gawking and chattering. </p><p>	Another woman chimed in. “I heard you were the last one to see Tommy before he disappeared.”</p><p>	“She’s purposefully obstructing justice and keeping Tommy somewhere,” another harsh voice roared. </p><p>	“<em>What </em>are you talking about? We don’t know about any ransom note,” Rio said.</p><p>	The man’s eyes were wild with paranoia, his fanged teeth bared like a dog. “The hell you do. Who are you? Are you working with her?” His arm shot out to grab Agatha, but Rio shoved him back on instinct. </p><p>	“<em>Back the fuck up</em>,” Rio snarled. She angled her body, using it as a makeshift shield between the growing crowd and Agatha. </p><p>	“Have you heard from Alice?” she asked. </p><p>	“No. Someone must’ve leaked it.” </p><p>	Rio looked out against the people gathering around them, and they looked back, challenging their next move.</p>

<p>The market descended into bedlam as soon as the wild man charged forward, shoving Rio back. Another man followed his lead, hands clawing for Agatha. He was older, red-faced and seemed to appear out of thin air, only there to wreak havoc.</p><p>	Rio didn’t hesitate. She didn’t think before she threw a right hook, landing square on the man’s nose. It crunched sideways as his neck snapped to the left and he tumbled back. </p><p>	Jen gasped and backed up from the table. </p><p>	Agatha seized the red-faced man by the wrist and twisted his arm. “Get your hands off me.”</p><p>	“Everyone back it up. Break it up!” Jen shouted. “Back up from the fucking table and break it up!”</p><p>	“<em>Agatha is the one who took Tommy!</em>”</p><p>	Agatha scoffed. “And where do you think I’m keeping him?”</p><p>	“Don’t fan the flames,” Jen scolded. “Everyone just take a breath.” </p><p>	A mother with black hair pushing a stroller emerged from the crowd. “Are you working with them?” </p><p>	Jen sighed. “Absolutely not. But my booth <em>is </em>right here and it’s not in the budget for my inventory to get fucked up.” </p><p>	Another voice crashed through the air. “What the hell are you hiding on your land, Harkness?” </p><p>“Why are you such a witch?”</p><p>“Just turn your land over and save Tommy!”</p><p>Rio and Agatha stood back-to-back, both ready to catch hands and tussle. Rio could hardly believe that <em>this </em>was her evening. </p><p>“<em>The cops aren’t doing enough</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Yeah! We have to take this into our own hands.</em>”</p><p>Something knocked into Rio’s hip and then shattered. Someone had thrown a half-filled beer bottle at her. The adrenaline in her bloodstream exploded as a barrage of people descended on her, clasping onto her biceps and shoving her around, trying to force her to the ground. She kept her eyes on Agatha, though, who was holding her own, elbowing the crowd away, making distance. </p><p>Suddenly, a metal canister clattered onto the ground, in the middle of the commotion, hissing and releasing white smoke. A voice dipped in static and authority boomed through a megaphone.</p><p>“Next person who throws a punch will be spending their week in jail.” </p><p>The crowd dispersed, like ants scurrying from giant predators. Agatha took Rio’s hand and waved through the smoke, looking for an escape route. They crouched behind Jen’s food truck, waiting for the tumult to clear. They were at the edge of a dirt parking lot, where some vendors had parked and set up trailers. </p><p>Tires crunched through sticks and weeds and scraped the dirt when they halted.</p><p>“Get in.” Alice pulled up to the curb, her rusty bumper grating against stone. It wasn’t her patrol car; it was an unmarked gold SUV from the early 2000s. </p><p>Agatha glared at her. “Well, well, well. You seem to be everywhere.”</p><p>Rio put her hand on her lower back. “Come on. We don’t have to do the whole song and dance.” </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Alice raced to Agatha’s house, parking further down the road. The three strutted up the path and into the house, peering over their shoulders, ensuring nobody saw them. </p><p>	As soon as Rio shut the door behind her and locked it, she took a seat on the couch next to Agatha. Alice paced in the living room. </p><p>	“Okay, we’re clear now. What the hell is this about a ransom note?” Rio asked. </p><p>	Alice rubbed her temples with her fingers, her wavy hair more disheveled than usual. She looked haggard, like she hadn’t gotten a good night’s sleep in days. “Commissioner Moore received a ransom note twelve hours ago. It was hidden inside an invoice.” She sighed. “God, I don’t know how the hell it leaked.”</p><p>	Agatha raised her eyebrows. “You don’t? That’s practically a trope for cops. You guys love to gossip.” </p><p>	Rio agreed silently with her eyes. </p><p>	“The note was short. Nothing jumped out at us, nothing distinctive about it. All it said was, ‘Agatha Harkness must relinquish her land in exchange for Tommy. You have 48 hours.’”</p><p>	“That’s it? No other details?” Agatha asked. “No playful jabs at me?”</p><p>	Rio squeezed her thigh. The woman loved to make incongruent comments for the occasion.</p><p>	Alice said it was a verbatim quote. </p><p>	Agatha groaned, her mouth tightening in frustration. “Was it a handwritten note? Was it typed? What kind of paper was used?”</p><p>	Croaking, Alice hesitated.</p><p>	“C’mon, Al. Nothing? Did you see it?”</p><p>	“Since when do you have a nickname for me?” Alice crossed her arms, and her leather jacket made a squeaking noise.</p><p>	Rio took her hat off. “Alice, what else do you know?” Agatha knocked her thigh into Rio’s. </p><p>	“It was a handwritten note. All caps. Really neat penmanship. That was probably what stood out the most,” Alice said. </p><p>	“Do you have pictures?” Rio asked. </p><p>	Alice shook her head.</p><p>	Agatha looked bewildered. “Well, how the hell did it leak?” It was a genuine question. </p><p>	“I followed the rules, okay?!” </p><p>	“Can we see the note?” Rio asked. “Can we physically go to the station and see the note?”</p><p>	Agatha and Alice both shot a look of ridicule at her. For once, they agreed on something. </p><p>	“Oh yeah, like that’s not going to attract a ton of attention,” Alice scoffed.</p><p>	Agatha snapped. “If I’m mentioned in that damn note, why haven’t any of you pigs reached out?”</p><p>	Rio chewed on her bottom lip, dissociating as Alice and Agatha traded insults. It couldn’t be <em>this </em>hard just to see that goddamn ransom note. Her eyes drifted, between Alice’s badge, clipped to her jacket, and Agatha’s reading glasses, scattered across the coffee table. </p><p>Something stupid and theatrical occurred to her. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	“Is this a poly-blend? Oh, God, it’s so itchy.” Agatha twitched in her oatmeal-colored slacks and smoothed it over. </p><p>	“Stop fidgeting,” Rio said, elbowing her. “This jacket smells like low tide, Alice. Where the hell did you get this?” She straightened the dark blue jacket over her chest. It was lined with a thin layer of white fleece, stained with yellowish spots in the armpits. </p><p>	“Hey, everybody in there knows your faces. This is what I had,” Alice insisted, eyes obscured by a pair of black Aviators. The sun was setting, but it was still too light to wear sunglasses.</p><p>She wore her patrol uniform, which was all navy blue, including the pinned tie, mostly sharp lines and shadows. She leaned against the wall closest to the back entrance of the department. It was time to perform an unnecessarily risky dance to get to the evidence board for Tommy, nestled in the detectives’ conference room, past hordes of cops and personnel. </p><p>Rio cast herself as a forensic tech, embodying a dodgy, menacing character, eyes hooded by her downturned navy baseball cap. Under her jacket, she wore a dark sweatshirt with a vague golden badge embroidered on the left breast. Around her neck, an old, clunky camera. She wore dark pants.</p><p>Agatha was cast as an unassuming yet fatal prosecutor in a beige pantsuit and a crisp white shirt. She dulled her cheekbones with a pair of horn-rimmed glasses that still, somehow made Rio’s heart plummet in between her legs. She carried a briefcase. </p><p>The back entrance at the department certainly lent itself to less foot traffic, but the three still waited for the stream of people to dwindle. </p><p>Alice jogged back to her car and emerged a minute later with two boxes of donuts. </p><p>“When the hell did you get donuts?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Can I have one?” Agatha asked, with a ragged edge to her voice. </p><p>Alice sighed. “Just be cool. Follow me.” The coast was nearly clear, save for one or two slow-moving civil personnel dragging their feet from the door to their cars. Alice sprung into action and entered the building, holding the door open for Agatha and Rio. </p><p>Inside the building, phones and chatter filled the air. There was a front desk with two men sitting behind the counter, and to its right was a wall of floor-to-ceiling tempered windows. Through the windows, Rio could see a maze of desks and people on phones, talking to one another, typing away on their computers. </p><p>Alice stopped at the desk and held the box of donuts open for the men behind the counter. “I’ll put the rest in the break room,” she said, capturing their attention while Agatha and Rio stood behind her, nonchalantly. They buzzed her in. Rio said hello to the men as if she knew them. Agatha pointedly ignored them. </p><p>As soon as they’d set foot on the detectives’ turf, a sea of heads turned and glanced over at Alice. Everyone was wearing some variation of dark slacks and a muted blue, white, or gray shirt with ties and blazers. Two detectives conferred over coffee at one desk, another chatted with a tech, leaning over their chair as they pointed at the monitor. A group of cops trudged through the office, tapping the desks with their fingers, mired in a conversation about traffic violation quotas. </p><p>The detectives’ conference room was all the way past the minefield of desks, through a hallway next to the break room. </p><p>Rio kept her gaze far and away, looking past everyone, trying to fade into the background. A familiar face looked up from his desk, rubbing his bloodshot blue eyes as he glared at his computer screen. His blond hair preceded him, and Rio remembered him immediately. Detective Leonia. Thankfully, he didn’t see her. </p><p>She pulled her cap down and stood behind Alice, who made a show of greeting people with the donuts. She muttered over her shoulder, “Go wait by the bulletin board next to the vending machine.” </p><p>Rio cleared her throat and broke off behind Alice, taking a sharp right towards a soda vending machine. She stopped in front of the bulletin board and pretended to look through her camera roll. Agatha followed her shortly, with a relaxed, confident gait, standing in front of the bulletin board, just a foot away from Rio. </p><p>“Donuts! In the break room!” Alice hollered, cutting through the middle path between two rows of desks. Everyone’s attention suddenly followed Alice, straight into the break room, past the desks. </p><p>Agatha leaned over and said from the corner of her mouth. “The jokes write themselves.” </p><p>Rio peered over her shoulder. “Let’s go.” She sprung into a quick stride, in a straight line through the desks and into the hallway. Alice made eye contact for a fraction of a second, as if to say, <em>hurry</em>. Then she resumed her sleight of hand, pointing at the donuts, introducing their flavors like each of them were characters in a play. </p><p>Agatha followed Rio, waiting for everyone shuffling about near the break room to turn their backs. </p><p>In the hallway, there were three rooms; two interrogation rooms and a conference room. It was unfamiliar. It was not the same place Rio had been interrogated. She tried the handle for the conference room, and it fell open without resistance. She and Agatha filed into the room and took in the evidence, tacked onto a board that was half bulletin and half whiteboard. </p><p>“They really are grasping at straws,” Agatha hissed. </p><p>Rio took pictures with her camera, shooting in quick succession, zooming in on photographs and pieces of writing and newspapers. </p><p>There was a photo of Tommy on the board, embedded in the Caplan family tree, which had been marked up with red and black pen, question marks and exclamations. There was Jeff and Rebecca Caplan, linked together, and then Billy and Tommy underneath them. “NOT biological,” the note read. No other notes had been scribbled, as if the existence of them would give way to another dimension of this mystery, pulling it in a completely different direction. </p><p>Then, an oddly artistic black-and-white Polaroid of Agatha glaring through a scene of chaos: toilet paper and eggs strewn and splashed across her house, a cop holding onto her baseball bat, her hands behind her. Now, Rio knew the look in her eyes was not merely disdain; it was rage, it was despair, and it was a never-dying agony.</p><p>Her name was written in jagged all-caps letters, in black, like a curse. Annandale and Leonia had clearly begun to consult more resources, as the penmanship morphed and evolved into a variable number of loops, dots, crosses, and lines. Most of the notes scrawled under her photograph recalled her most notable arrests and unpleasant encounters with Westview. </p><p>Certain avaricious townspeople had long suspected that the land Agatha’s house was built on was rich with rare metals—unnamed and unknown to the public. </p><p>Alice’s voice carried over, boisterous and friendly. Rio swallowed. </p><p>“Do you know what they’re talking about?” Rio asked. </p><p>“How does the treasurer know about your land? The collector of revenue? The fucking comptroller? They’ve never taken core samples, have they?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head and adjusted her glasses, pushing them up the bridge of her nose. “I don’t know. Some asshole started a rumor years ago that they’d found in the annals of Westview’s history. There’s a material, an alloy, that hasn’t been found anywhere else that’s allegedly indestructible and can store kinetic energy. I didn’t care to find out more.”</p><p>“Did you find out on your own?” Rio was learning too much too fast. None of this sounded real.</p><p>“It was that goddamned land developer. He told me all of that and said he’d pay me for the rest of my life if I gave up the house and let them raze it to the ground and gouge into the land.” She scoffed. “He thought I’d let him gouge into Nicky for a buck. I lost my mind.” </p><p>Rio looked at her, resisting the urge to lean any closer.</p><p>Agatha held onto her gaze, deep in thought, inching closer. She cleared her throat. </p><p>Then, she poked her head into the hallway to eavesdrop on the cops, just a few feet away. “Hurry.” </p><p>Rio continued to take pictures and study the board.</p><p>The detectives noted the interrogation and her whereabouts on the night he disappeared and included a photo of Rio, taken while she was out on a job, in her coveralls, a tool bag in hand. A line had been drawn between Agatha and her. </p><p>Their bond together was as real to the world as it was to Rio. People <em>knew </em>about them. What grew and propagated between them was real; it was no fling, and it had been written in the public tapestry.</p><p>There was a map of the search effort and labels where some of Tommy’s belongings had been found. </p><p>“There’s the note,” Agatha said. It was a photo of the ransom note, with an indication of when it had been sent to the lab—last night.</p><p>Rio read the note aloud. “‘Agatha Harkness must relinquish her land in exchange for Tommy. You have 48 hours.’” </p><p>“Huh,” Agatha murmured, squinting at the note, her lip curling up with a sense of curiosity. Under the photo of the note, there were more questions: “Tungsten? Rhodium? Adamantium?” </p><p>The timber of Alice’s voice tumbled through the hall, growing louder. The tone in her voice alerted Rio. </p><p>“...I couldn’t wait to <em>get out </em>of traffic patrol,” she said. </p><p>Agatha stood, planted in front of the note, her face contorted in concentration. “There’s something about the penmanship…have you ever seen a ‘48’ written like that?”</p><p>Rio stopped for a second, freezing the frame of her vision. “Come on, we have to go.”</p><p>She and Agatha left the room and scurried for a door further into the hallway, where they escaped to the stairwell. </p><p>A second later, Alice barreled through the door with half a chocolate cake donut in hand. “Did you get what you needed?”</p><p>Agatha snatched the donut from her. “Where’s the evidence room?”</p><p>Mouth still half-full, Alice said, “Oh, hell no. We’re not going down there.” </p><p>Agatha turned to Rio and winked. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p> </p><p>	Alice grimaced at Rio, her arms crossed tightly against her chest. She had begrudgingly led Rio and Agatha down to the evidence room in the basement. The evidence clerk barely batted an eye, never looking up from his coffee and newspaper. He was a balding, grey-haired man with colorless eyes and a permanently slack mouth that indicated neither contentedness nor dissatisfaction. </p><p>	The evidence room was smaller than Rio thought it would be. It consisted of five long rows of metal shelves, fastened with giant bolts drilled into the concrete floor. Boxes labeled with names, dates, and addresses lined every shelf. There were loose, thick stacks of paper on top of every odd box, acting as impromptu overflows. Fluorescent tube lights hung over the room, but the floor seemed to swallow up the light. </p><p>	“This town is lawless,” Alice sighed.</p><p>Shrugging, Rio assured, “We’ll be quick. She’s persuasive, isn’t she?” She watched as Agatha reached up the shelves, hauling boxes down, tearing through the papers and bagged evidence and belongings in each one. </p><p>“Goddamn it, how are these boxes organized?” Agatha hissed. She pulled down another box. </p><p>Something rustled from the next shelf over, and Rio whipped her head back over her shoulder. “What was that?”</p><p>Alice held her finger up to her lips and reached for her flashlight. “Hello?” she called out. “We know you’re there.”</p><p>There was no answer. Agatha continued to devour the boxes, scanning documents and then tossing them aside. Rio shot her a look and told her to hush. </p><p>There was another rustle.</p><p>“Walk out with your hands behind your head,” Alice commanded. </p><p>Silence settled in the air. Alice took careful, quiet steps to the next row over and shined her light. </p><p>It fell upon Billy’s face. He was snoring against the wall with a box, open in his lap, papers strewn across the floor. </p>

<p>“Jesus, Billy. How long have you been here?” Rio asked, kneeling next to him, squeezing his shoulder.</p><p>	Agatha abandoned her tornado of papers and boxes and kneeled on the opposite side. She pet the top of his head and retracted her fingers quickly. “Well, he definitely hasn’t showered.” </p><p>	“I hated when you did that before and I hate it now,” Billy grumbled. </p><p>	“I see why the jokes write themselves now,” Alice mumbled.</p><p>	“What are you looking for?” Agatha asked. </p><p>	“My biological parents,” he said. His black eyeliner was smeared at the bottom, but it looked intentional. “So far, according to this report, something happened to my dad when I was five, and my mom left soon after that. There’s nothing that says how me and Tommy ended up with our parents.”</p><p>	“You were five?” Rio asked. She didn’t mean to probe, but she did, and asked if he could remember anything from before that. </p><p>	“You know, it’s strange,” Billy said. “I could never put my finger on why I’ve always felt a little out of place. It’s like I’ve lived two lives. Like I’m two distinct people. The only thing I remember about before…was that my mom had red hair. I never connected the dots until now.” </p><p>	Alice turned her flashlight off and tucked it into a deep pocket on her left leg. “Memories can be deceiving.”</p><p>	“I know it was her I was remembering,” Billy said. “I can feel it.” </p><p>	There was a clamor of heavy, gravelly voices and the thud of boxes hitting the front desk. Rio snapped her head neck back and looked over her shoulder and then back at Billy. “Take some pictures and then we gotta get outta here.” </p><p>	Agatha got back up and took a few items from the boxes she’d turned over, stuffing them into her coat pockets when Alice wasn’t looking. </p><p>	“There’s a shift change happening soon,” Alice called back as she strained her neck to get a look at the evidence clerk. “Let’s go.” </p><p align="center">+	+	+</p><p>	Alice drove Rio and Agatha to the house, and Billy sped off in a Subaru. As Alice pulled up, Rio stared out the window, her spine becoming brittle when she saw the first photographer, and then another, and another. Cameramen, reporters, and townspeople stood out front, shouting into the void. Two men stomped through the bushes and peered inside the windows. </p><p>	“Wow, we really need to accelerate the news cycle here,” Agatha snarled.</p><p>	Alice turned around. “Don’t react, Agatha.”</p><p>	She rolled her eyes. “You could just look the other way.”</p><p>	“<em>Agatha</em>, I’m serious,” Alice pressed.</p><p>	“Fine.”</p><p>	As soon as the three emerged from the SUV, everyone’s attention lasered in on Agatha, and the cacophony followed it. Reporters relentlessly attacked with question, shoving their microphones in Agatha’s face and occasionally Rio’s and Alice’s. </p><p>	“Are the rumors true? Do you have rare resources in your backyard?”</p><p>	“Why the hell are you refusing to cooperate with the cops?”</p><p>	“We should just go back there ourselves!”</p><p>	Alice shot a look at the man who shouted that. “You’ll be charged with trespassing before you make it back there.” </p><p>	Cameras shuttered like gnats and the flash blinded Rio as she flanked Agatha, holding a hand out to block the reporters. </p><p>	Alice rushed Rio and Agatha inside and then shoved the door shut, throwing her back against it. “Holy shit. I haven’t seen action like this since the riot over apple butter at the bakery.” </p><p>	“Fuck, I’m starving.” Agatha immediately ditched the conversation and disappeared into the kitchen, banging away on pans, cooking dinner.</p><p>Rio fell back onto the couch and Alice loitered with her hands in her pockets. “Look, I’m  gonna stick around tonight,” she said. </p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You saw what it was like out there,” Alice said, poking her fingers through the blinds to get another look. “People are riled up. I just want to make sure nobody tries anything.”</p><p>Rio slinked lower down the couch and eyed Alice suspiciously. “I never thought I’d see the day that you watch out for Agatha Harkness.” </p><p>Alice coughed. “It’s my job.”</p><p>Agatha hollered for Rio and Alice. She had whipped up a salad and grilled burgers with chips on the side. The three of them ate at the dining room table quietly, grubbing after the adrenaline of stealth had worn off. </p><p>“We’re no closer to finding out who the hell took Tommy, even with the ransom note,” Agatha said. “So, what do we do now?”</p><p>“We sleep on it,” Alice said. “Speaking of which, can I get a comforter and a pillow?”</p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	Rio talked Agatha down that night, convincing her that Alice staying the night was a good thing. Words didn’t work, but as soon as she took off her shirt, it seemed to quell Agatha’s protest. </p><p>	As they shed their clothes, Rio wrestled Agatha for power, never staying on her back for more than a minute at a time. Agatha kissed her neck and nibbled on her ear, grinding on Rio sensually. Rio held onto her wrist and held her by the hip, savoring every moment, quietly, reminding herself that <em>Alice </em>was in the house. </p><p>	Rio giggled under breath, kissing Agatha, when she suddenly pulled away and untangled herself. </p><p>	“Whoa, wait, where are you going?” Rio whispered. She leaned on her elbows, lifting her head to watch Agatha slink into her black robe, flinging her hair over her shoulders.</p><p>	“<em>Shhh</em>…” Agatha said. She left the bedroom. Rio hoisted herself from the bed and threw on a pair of sweats. She went into the hallway. </p><p>	“Agatha?” Rio followed the sound of rustling into Agatha’s office. “What are you doing?”</p><p>	“Pull up the picture of the ransom note,” Agatha said, in the dim lighting of her desk lamp. She didn’t look up.</p><p>	Rio pulled up the photos she’d taken earlier. She handed the phone to Agatha. </p><p>	“There!” Agatha said. “I couldn’t put my finger on where I’d seen this before, but I <em>knew </em>I’d seen this handwriting before.” She handed Rio a business card. </p><p>	On the white card was a phone number: 425-340-9298. The four were written distinctively, like right-angled triangles. The stems didn’t protrude from the number. </p><p>	Rio looked at the ransom note again: You have 48 hours. </p><p> 	The four was <em>identical</em>, without question. It wouldn’t have taken a handwriting expert to deduce that the person who had written that phone number and the ransom note was the same person.</p><p>	“We know who took Tommy,” Agatha concluded. </p><p>	Rio flipped the business card over and her eyes landed on an all-too-familiar and obvious name: </p><p>	JON MEPHISTO, land developer and investor. </p><p align="center">*	*	*</p><p>	The next morning, the three immediately dove into Agatha’s discovery, strategizing on their next move and keeping an eye on the simmering madness just outside the four walls of the house. </p><p>	Alice clenched her jaw and chewed the inside of her cheeks. Rio didn’t like to see her nervous; it made her stomach drop. </p><p>	“We can’t bring this to the station,” Agatha insisted.</p><p>	“I don’t know if we have another choice,” Alice said.</p><p>	“Alice, don’t be naïve. Let’s play this out, shall we? It’s a predictable story,” she sneered. “We go to the cops and they’ll give me up, right? You guys will give in to the ransom, and don’t pretend like you won’t.” Agatha stood up, nostrils flaring. Rio couldn’t bear to look her in the eyes, and to see the frantic desperation and rage boiling underneath. She’d been backed into a corner.</p><p>	She continued. “So, what happens if I give up my land, and Mephisto doesn’t bring Tommy back? What happens then?”</p><p>	Rio gulped down a glass of iced water, her resolve shattering inside. She didn’t know what the right choice was, but she knew it wasn’t hers to make. She felt powerless, standing by Agatha, not knowing what to offer or if she could offer anything at all. </p><p>	“Look, the longer we sit on this information, the worse this is going to get. God knows what the hell he wants with Tommy or what he’s done to him!” Alice glared back at Agatha, leaning over the dining room table. “We can get your land back for you, if this works.”</p><p>	“Oh, <em>really</em>? ‘If’ this works? Are you willing to bet your career on it? Given the department’s well-documented history of fucking me over?” Agatha crossed her arms tightly, holding onto the tension like a taut cable. Rio could barely breathe, let alone say a word. </p><p>	Agatha’s voice softened into a dangerously calm curse. “The last time Mephisto came to Westview for my land, you all but sold me to him. You were all ready to give my house, my possessions, and my land in exchange for the bullshit he was selling you.”</p><p>	“Agatha—”</p><p>	“<em>Where </em>the hell were the cops, Alice, when that avaricious asshole was threatening me and slandering me to the press? Where were you when people were breaking my windows? Where were you when the town turned against me? Shunned me?”</p><p>	“I wasn’t in charge of any of those decisions,” Alice snapped, slamming her hand down on the table.</p><p>	Rio interjected, but was overshadowed immediately by the intensity of the room. </p><p>	“He was offering Westview millions of dollars to renew this town, to grow!” Alice said. “You know, from the way that you hide behind the land, I’m starting to think there’s something to the rumors.”</p><p>	Agatha fell silent. “Tread carefully.” </p><p>	Rio stood at the head of the table, hoping to defuse the escalating uncertainty. </p><p>	“What the hell are you hiding, Agatha? The truth <em>will </em>come out, eventually, and I can’t protect you if you’re not forthcoming with me.” </p><p>	“<em>Nothing</em>. But we can’t just give up. We won’t have leverage,” Agatha said. </p><p>	Alice took a deep breath, all the way up to her shoulders. “Look, there’s no way around this. We have to bring this to the department, for Tommy.” She shot a look at Rio, looking for support. </p><p>	Rio bit her bottom lip, refusing to participate. </p><p>	Agatha scoffed. “Fine.”</p><p>	Rio couldn’t believe she would capitulate so fast. “Really?”</p><p>	Alice also couldn’t believe it, bewildered and caught off-guard.</p><p>Agatha stood up, inhaling, and then let herself deflate. She looked Rio in the eyes. “Will you go upstairs and grab that business card?”</p><p>Rio nodded and made her way upstairs, going straight to Agatha’s office. Last night, they’d left the mess of rummaging through her drawers and bookshelves as it was. The card sat on a shelf, between a ceramic bird figurine and a stack of books. Rio dropped the card. </p><p>A sudden ruckus erupted through the house, and something clattered onto the ground with a dull thud. Rio turned on her heel and rushed downstairs. </p><p>As she entered the living room, the soles of Alice’s boots greeted her first. She laid on her back, out cold, arms resting at her sides. </p><p>“What the <em>fuck</em> happened?” Rio asked, empty-handed. </p><p>Agatha wandered into the dining room from the kitchen with a glass of wine. “I couldn’t let her take this back to the department. We have to figure something out, <em>now</em>. We don’t have much time.”</p>
