<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“I did not enter this marriage under grounds of love or other frivolous feelings,” Rio said, voice steady. “It was an act of duty. Nothing more.”</p>
<p>Agatha tilted her head, folding her arms.<br/>“You paid quite a high price for ‘nothing more’, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Rio’s jaw twitched. Her eyes sharpened into something dangerous. Controlled but cracking.</p>
<p>Agatha felt it. The shift, the restraint, the want.<br/>She wanted to break it.<br/>She wanted to own it.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>With the king dead and the kingdom on the brink, Princess Agatha is placed on the auction block — a pawn to be bartered for power, her hand sold to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>She expects a life of misery. Obedience. Silence.</p>
<p>She does not expect Rio Vidal. The cold, revered queen of a neighbouring realm. A warrior cloaked in shadows and secrets. A woman who seems determined to keep her at arm’s length.</p>
<p>Their marriage is a weapon. A wall. A vow.</p>
<p>But no walls are strong enough to stop what is destined to grow between them.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>New fic alert.‼️ I have been wanting to write a fic like this for the longest time and honestly the warm response from my other fic MLL gave me the confidence to finally attempt this.

<p>Slight tw for depictions of actions that can be interpreted as self harm.</p>
<p>And don’t worry I wont be forgetting about my first baby My Little Love. The ao3 curse lowkey got me and I lost my job recently but on the bright side I guess I have slightly more time to write while looking for a new one.😅</p></blockquote>

      Chapter 1: The Price of a Throne
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The temple air was cold. The kind of cold that seeped into one’s bones and coaxed hairs on the back of the neck to rise, despite the last of the summer sun still shining outside. </p><p>Incense drifted through the chamber, thick and cloying. It failed to mask the rot beneath the roses.</p><p>Agatha tried to sit still. Truly she did. Even as her corset pinched and the fabric of her dress itched like nettles against her skin. The veil scratched against her cheek with every small movement, hot breath clouding the sheer fabric. A black shroud to match the mood. To mask a face that must not reveal too much.</p><p>Her mother had insisted. As if the veil might keep her from speaking out of turn. From revealing too much of herself — or perhaps, from revealing the half healed bruise on her left cheek.</p><p>That was what one was supposed to do at their father’s funeral, after all. At least someone of her status. So her mother had reminded her. </p><p>There was no room for frivolous tears, not where her mother was concerned. Such displays were reserved for common folk. </p><p>Would she have cried though, if that cold, judgmental gaze hadn’t been fixed so sharply on her? She wasn’t sure.</p><p>Perhaps, if she had truly been a common girl, and her father a common man, they might have shared a common bond. Then, perhaps, she could have wept freely at his death.</p><p>But she was not a common girl. And her father had been far from a common man. He had been a king and had possessed all the qualities of one. Stern, indifferent and conceited. </p><p>She had a few memories, perhaps distorted by time or longing. Of her father being kind. Gentle, even. She mourned that time, at least. Before she came of age and he no longer looked at her the same. As though she was no longer his precious  little princess, but something else. Something that needed to be feared. </p><p>“Would you quit that. Sit up straight.” </p><p>A sharp hiss pulled her from her thoughts. She blinked and looked down, realising she had once again been picking at the skin around her nails. Thankfully, she hadn’t drawn blood this time. Her mother hated when she did that. It was quite “unbefitting” apparently. </p><p>She folded her arms neatly on top of her lap and tried to straighten her posture further. And if her thumb dug into the flesh of her palm for the rest of the ceremony — well, that was her business. </p><hr/><p>As the ceremony drew to a close, Agatha found herself growing restless. It was hard to remain expressionless and proper while listening to such a glowing description of her father that was so far removed from her own recollection.</p><p> “A brave and honourable king, who served each and every one of his subjects with pride and wisdom.” </p><p>She wanted to agree. She truly did. But all she could recall was as a man ruled by fear and mistrust. He had not been accepting and celebratory to all, as they claimed. More… tolerable. At best.</p><p>She nearly sighed aloud when the High Attendant finally concluded the rites, his voice fading as the body was carried down into the crypt. A soft chant rose behind the procession, but Agatha barely heard it. She slipped away before her mother could catch her eye.</p><p>The walk from the temple to the river was short, familiar. She followed the path in silence, descending the stone steps until she stood beneath the bare-limbed branches of an old tree, leaning lightly against its trunk. The bark scratched at her shoulder through the fabric of her dress — a small, grounding discomfort.</p><p>From here, she could still hear the distant murmur of voices—nobles, no doubt, offering their performative condolences to the Queen. Their sympathy, like their loyalty, lasted only as long as it was politically convenient.</p><p>She turned her gaze to the river.</p><p>Its surface gleamed with dying sunlight, darkening at the edges. The current was slow today, contemplative.</p><p>She had always found a strange kind of comfort in watching its waters.</p><p>The way the ripples stretched and folded, how the light broke against the surface, how the current seemed to shift its path for no one.</p><p>Sometimes, she wondered what it was the river knew.</p><p>Why it bent where it bent.</p><p>Why it had carried her here, of all places.</p><p>And when, <em>if</em>,  it would carry her somewhere else.</p><p>Somewhere farther.</p><p>Somewhere freer.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long she stood there before the crunch of boots on gravel broke the silence behind her.</p><p>“Your Highness.”</p><p>She turned. A young guard stood a few paces away, bowing stiffly.</p><p>“Your mother—the Queen, requests your presence. She said it is urgent.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Urgent? At this moment?”</p><p>“Aye,” the guard replied, eyes fixed somewhere over her shoulder. “She said it was a matter of great importance.”</p><p>Agatha tried to hold back an eye roll at that. “I see. And what, exactly, could be so important with her husband not yet cold?”</p><p>“I am only the messenger, my lady.”</p><p>“Of course you are.”</p><p>She didn’t move right away. Let the pause drag. Let her mother wait.</p><p>Then, finally, with a soft exhale, she pushed off the tree and began the slow walk back toward the castle.</p><hr/><p>“Agatha, there you are. What have I told you about slipping away?” Her mother ushered her into the council room with haste, annoyance hidden behind a carefully constructed smile.</p><p>“Sorry mother.” She responded plainly. Her response would not change her mother’s disproval. It never did. </p><p>“Keep your apologies child. Sit. We have much to discuss.”</p><p>Unease unfurled low in her stomach. Something was afoot, and judging by the stares fixed upon her, it concerned her directly.</p><p>She hesitated, then obeyed, folding herself into the empty chair at her mother’s side. Her gaze swept the chamber, taking in the men of the council, grim faced and sharp eyed. She had never been summoned to sit with them before.</p><p>“Mother,” she asked carefully, “may I ask what this is about? Surely the council might have waited until Father’s body had grown comfortable in his crypt.”</p><p>“Hush, child. You speak so strangely sometimes.” Her mother’s hand settled on her shoulder. To onlookers it would appear to be an act of motherly comfort. Only Agatha could feel her nails digging into her flesh like talons. </p><p>“Forgive her,” the Queen said smoothly, addressing the men. “It is the grief. She misses her dear father terribly.”</p><p>One of the advisors cleared his throat. His voice was formal, but his eyes lingered on Agatha with thinly veiled disdain.</p><p>“Your Highness, we regret the haste of this gathering. But with His Majesty’s passing, the kingdom stands… precarious. The borders are restless. Rivals circle like vultures. We cannot allow uncertainty to invite their strike.”</p><p>“Forgive me, but I am struggling to understand what my purpose here is today. I have never been invited to such councils.”</p><p>The man’s lips thinned. He did not answer her directly. Instead, he continued. “There is, of course, the matter of succession. You are the late King’s blood, but… the court cannot place the crown upon someone of your…abilities. It is far too… unpredictable. The people would not follow. Alone, you cannot rule.”</p><p>The words landed like stones. Agatha forced her face still, though her stomach roiled.</p><p>“Our solution,” he pressed on, “is a union. A strong alliance with another nation will provide protection, resources, and legitimacy. It is the swiftest way to secure our throne and quiet any dissent.”</p><p>Now the sickness rose higher, bile pressing sharp against her throat. There was no reason she need be present for a discussion of treaties. Unless—</p><p>Her mother’s voice cut the thought short. Honey sweet. Too sweet.</p><p>“What they mean, dearest, is that we shall conduct an auction. And the prize—” she smiled thinly, “shall be your hand in marriage.”</p><p>The words struck like a lash.</p><p>Her blood iced. Sweat pricked her skin. The chamber tilted, shrinking in around her.</p><p>She had in the space of mere minutes been reduced to a commodity. </p><p>A pawn.</p><p>As though she was nothing more than a piece of meat to be bartered for a crown.</p><p>Her fingers curled tightly in her lap. She could feel the sting of her nails digging into her palm again, sharp enough to leave little half moons in the skin. She didn’t cry. She wouldn’t give them the satisfaction.</p><p>But her silence would not be surrender.</p><hr/><p>If asked, Rio would say that Lilia Caldera was her most trusted advisor. It had less to do with the woman’s once famed divination gifts and more to do with the fact that Rio trusted her—wholly, unquestionably. Perhaps more than any other living soul. </p><p>So when Lilia stepped into her office speaking of visions, threads and shifting tides, Rio was only half listening . Her pen scratched absently across the margin of a requisition form, her thoughts elsewhere.</p><p>She trusted Lilia. Implicitly. If Lilia told her to move, she moved.</p><p>“I need you to do something,” Lilia said. “Something very important.”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio murmured, not looking up. “Name it.”</p><p>There was a pause. Then, with infuriating lightness. “I need you to enter a marriage auction.”</p><p>The pen stopped.</p><p>Rio lifted her head slowly.</p><p>“…Pardon?”</p><p>Lilia smiled — all serene wisdom, as if she hadn’t just attempted to shatter the known laws of Rio’s universe.</p><p>“For a young princess. The daughter of a fallen king. The courts of her kingdom have decided she cannot take the crown despite being the only heir. She’s an unseen , I hear. They deem her too unstable, too dangerous to lead. A marriage of political strength is the only thing that will allow her to keep even a sliver of power.”</p><p>Rio inhaled slowly, and carefully set her pen aside.</p><p>A girl. A kingdom. A crown that was hers by blood and denied by fear. She imagined the weight of a throne pressed into shoulders that weren’t ready, the grief of a father barely buried, the cold realisation that her life would never again be her own.</p><p>Rio knew that feeling far too well.</p><p>“How young?” she asked at last, eyes narrowing.</p><p>“She is of age,” Lilia replied. “Nineteen summers behind her.”</p><p>“That’s barely out of girlhood.” Rio frowned.</p><p>“If I remember correctly you were already ruling an entire queendom at that age.”</p><p>“Precisely,” Rio snapped. “And no child should have to grow up the way I did. And no young woman should be sold off before she’s even had a chance to live.”</p><p>Lilia didn’t flinch. “It is unfortunate. But consider what could happen if she falls into the hands of more… unfavourable bidders.”</p><p>That gave Rio pause.</p><p>The Brotherhood. Vassal lords with a taste for subjugation. Old men who saw wives as possessions.</p><p>She could imagine the kind of life this girl might be forced to endure under the wrong banner.</p><p>And though she told herself this wasn’t her problem, the thought of it curled something cold and sharp beneath her ribs.</p><p>“Lilia,” Rio said quietly, “I respect your judgment. And I do empathise with the girl. Truly. But I cannot be of help in this. I have no interest in marriage. Or consorts. And everything else that would come of such a public union. You know this.”</p><p>“This isn’t about affection,” Lilia said gently . “You do not need to love her. But we must consider the bigger picture. The princess’s kingdom holds trade routes we can’t afford to let fall into enemy hands. The Brotherhood has been pushing at your borders for seasons. With this marriage, you gain a diplomatic foothold in the East — and prevent a witch burning regime from claiming another throne. “</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“And you… could give her something none of them can. Safety. Dignity. Freedom.”</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw.</p><p>She wanted to say no. Gods, she wanted to. She wanted to laugh it off and leave Lilia with her riddles.</p><p>But she couldn’t.</p><p>Perhaps it was the strange pressure in the back of her mind, the tug in her marrow. Or perhaps it was something older — a memory she didn’t want to name.</p><p>A young girl. Alone. Grieving. Watching others barter for the power that should have been hers.</p><p>She knew what it meant to be used. To be underestimated.</p><p>And she knew what it cost to take that power back.</p><p>“…Fine,” she said at last, “I’ll enter this auction,” The word auction tasting like rot on her tongue “but I make no promises to win.”</p><p>Lilia bowed, satisfied. “As you wish your Majesty”</p><p>She left the room like a tide receding.</p><p>Rio remained seated, jaw tight, breath locked in her chest. The quill in her hand cracked with a soft, splintering sound. Ink spilling over her hand like black blood. </p><p>She couldn’t recall when she had even picked it up again.</p><p>The word still sat in her mouth like ash.</p><p><em>Auction</em>.</p><p>As if the girl were nothing but livestock, a contract written in blood and gold.</p><p>Rio didn’t want a bride. She wanted to break the table this <em>offering</em> was being served on.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>A soft knock sounded on Agatha’s door, interrupting her relentless pacing. She knew immediately who it belonged to. </p><p>Her mother never knocked and waited. She preferred to barge in, trailing disdain like perfume. Her father had never wandered near her chamber while he lived.  </p><p>No, this knock was familiar. She knew the rhythm like the lines on her palms.</p><p>Jen had been her closest friend since childhood — her only friend really. While the rest of the castle treated Agatha like a fragile secret to be contained, Jen treated her like a person. They’d spent countless nights in this very room whispering about books, gossip, and escape plans under candlelight. Jen was perhaps, the only person who truly knew her.</p><p>Agatha flung open the door and grabbed her wrist before pulling her inside, shutting the door firmly behind them.</p><p>“It took you long enough to get here.”</p><p>“I know, I’m sorry. I came as soon as I could, but my mother held me up — said she needed a hand in the infirmary.” Jen paused, studying her. “I’d ask if it’s true what I heard, but your face is answer enough.”</p><p>And what a sight she must have been. Her hair half undone, the silk hem of her nightgown creased and wrinkled, her eyes red from tears of anger and sleeplessness.</p><p>“They’re calling for an auction,” she muttered, resuming her pacing. “As though I’m livestock. Or a painting to be sold to the highest bidder.” </p><p>Jen perched on the window seat, legs tucked under her dress, watching her friend circle the room like a storm of silk. “You’ll wear a hole in the floor if you keep pacing like that.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha snapped. Maybe the castle will collapse and release me from this misery.”</p><p>“Hey,” Jen said softly, standing and placing her hands on Agatha’s shoulders. “It’s going to be alright.”</p><p>Agatha looked away, throat tight. “No it’s not. They wont even <em>consider</em> letting me rule. Not because I’m unfit. But because I was born with magic  <em>they</em> cannot control. They’re marrying me off to keep me contained. To keep the Unseen out of power.”</p><p>Jens tone gentled. “I know it’s wrong, but maybe it isn’t personal. It’s how things have always been—politics and all that.”</p><p>Agatha shook free of her grip, her voice rising. “That’s easy for you to say when you’re not the one they’re afraid of. You don’t know what it’s like to be looked down on, feared, <em>hated</em> for something you had no choice in. I never wanted any of this. All I ever wanted was to study, to learn, to travel… to live without shame. And now I’m to smile and curtsy for some stranger with a title and too many teeth.”</p><p>Jen’s expression softened. She hesitated, guilt flickering across her face before she stepped forward again, tentatively. “You’re right, it isn’t fair. It’s absurd that we’re still divided by something as meaningless as Seen and Unseen.” She placed a steadying hand on Agatha’s arm. “You’d have made an excellent queen.”</p><p>Agatha sniffed, wiping her eyes a little too forcefully.</p><p>“How do you know though, that they’ll have too many teeth?” Jen asked after a beat. </p><p>“I can just feel it,” Agatha said with a wet laugh. “No man with perfect teeth would buy a wife at an auction.”</p><p>Jen tilted her head. “And how do you know it’ll be a man? Maybe the River might bless you and join you with someone you may actually like.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “As if my mother would ever let that happen. The River would have to freeze over before I’d be permitted to marry another woman. It will be a man. An old, smelly man.”</p><p>Her shoulders sagged. “I’m scared, Jen. What if it’s another cage? Another place where I’ll have to ask permission to breathe?”</p><p>Jen caught her hands, squeezing. “Then we’ll find a way out. If he’s awful, I’ll help you run. We’ll steal a horse, head east, live off honey and stolen apples. You can open a tiny school for rebellious girls and I’ll sell potions on the side.”</p><p>That earned a faint, shaky smile. “You’d last two days before falling for some beekeeper.”</p><p>“Only if they have an acceptable amount of teeth,” Jen said primly.</p><p>Agatha laughed for real this time, the sound startling in the quiet room. Then she sank onto the bed, gathering a fistful of her skirt. “It shouldn’t be funny. My life is being dismantled, and I can’t even stop it.”</p><p>Jen brushed a strand of hair from her face. “Then start planning how to build the next one. Maybe this marriage isn’t the end for you. Maybe it’s the start of something else.”</p><p>Agatha turned toward the window. Beyond the glass, the river cut a silver path through the valley—the same river she used to dream of following to the sea. “It doesn’t feel like a beginning.”</p><p>“Maybe not yet,” Jen murmured. “But it could be. You’re still Agatha Harkness. No amount of money can buy or tame that.”</p><p>For a long moment, neither spoke. The castle bells tolled somewhere below, counting down the hours till morning.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, trembling. “Then let them bid,” she said at last. “But I swear, whoever wins will regret the price.”</p><hr/><p>The room was colder than the rest of the palace. </p><p>Rio’s boots echoed softly across the obsidian floor as she entered, the sound swallowed by the vast, domed chamber. In the center sat a shallow pool — circular, rimmed with pale riverstone. Its surface shimmered faintly, water flowing in place, never still, as if breathing.</p><p>They called it <em>The Mirror of the Source.</em></p><p>Anyone of importance kept one — monarchs, lords, and high council members alike. Each was carved from water drawn directly from the River of Life, bound with ancient spells that allowed the powerful to gather in body or in spirit across impossible distances.</p><p>Lilia stood at the edge of the pool, hands folded. “You don’t have to attend, you know. The council could send an emissary in your stead.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look at her. “If the council wishes to bind my house to another’s, I’d at least like to see the cost of the transaction.”</p><p>She approached the pool. A faint current reached toward her boots, as though sensing the magic in her veins. She ignored it and crouched, touching the water with her fingertips.</p><p>It was freezing. It always was.</p><p>She murmured the invocation, her voice low, controlled. Detached. The water rippled, glowing faintly green at her touch before clearing again. Around the chamber, runes etched into the stone flared to life.</p><p>When she opened her eyes again, she was elsewhere.</p><p>The river water beneath her feet became glass. Shadows of other monarchs and nobles flickered around the room — translucent figures standing over their own mirrors in distant lands. Voices overlapped — polite laughter, barbed courtesy, the thrum of politics disguised as civility  filling the space.</p><p>Rio folded her hands behind her back, expression unreadable. She didn’t want to be here. Curse Lilia for always managing to twist her arm. </p><p>The conversations droned on — men congratulating each other on trade routes, trying to squeeze alliances out of one another. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority were much older. Men who could have fathered her, never mind the girl whose name was about to be auctioned.</p><p>The air shifted suddenly.</p><p>A projection flared to life in the center of the chamber. Stylised, gilded and insultingly romantic — depicting the girl whose hand was about to be auctioned. </p><p>Agatha Harkness. </p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly. <em>So this is the girl. </em></p><p>The Harkness line was old — much like her own. A much more…traditional kingdom though, by all accounts. The dévide between Seen and Unseen ran deep there. Something Rio herself had never truly understood. It was no surprise that they refused to let the girl inherit the throne. People tended to fear what they could not see. For what they could not see, they could not control. </p><p>She examined the image . The artist had done the girl no favors. Too much rouge on the lips. Eyes downcast like a meek maiden. She looked… small. A convenient fiction for the men gathered here, who liked their prey compliant.</p><p>“Charming little thing,” one of the lords drawled. His voice echoed through the spectral chamber. “I hear she’s spirited. The kind that breaks nicely after a few months.”</p><p>Another voice laughed — low, sleazy. “Spirited or not, that’s a fine mouth she’s got.”</p><p>The muscles in Rio’s jaw twitched. For a moment, she almost felt the phantom weight of her sword at her hip, before she reminded herself this was only glass and water.</p><p>Besides, this was none of her concern. She was here only to maintain appearances, to make a modest bid, appease the council, and leave.</p><p>But the words grated.</p><p>The first bid came. Five thousand silvers. An insulting price for another life. </p><p>Another followed. Then another.</p><p>The numbers grew — and with them, the sly comments.</p><p>“Surely a girl like that cannot be worth this much. “ </p><p>“Do you think she’s even pure? women of her power are known to be…bewitching.”</p><p>Rio ground her teeth, the noise around her blurring into static. She lifted her chin and spoke for the first time, her voice even. </p><p>“Five hundred thousand.”</p><p>Silence followed — a moment of stunned quiet before the chamber erupted in murmurs. </p><p>Someone scoffed. “Lady Death must be bored, if she’s buying wives now.”</p><p>Rio said nothing. Her reflection in the river water stared back, eyes dark and steady.</p><p>“Eight hundred thousand,” another voice countered. </p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked toward the sound. <em>Lord Bohner</em>. Of course. The man was a parasite, always crawling toward power he hadn’t earned. The thought of him marrying into that bloodline— of his slimy hands, meant to exploit on that girl, stirred something dark beneath her ribs.</p><p>“One million.” She countered. </p><p>“Two,” Bohner snapped. His translucent figure turned toward her, bristling.</p><p>A few nervous laughs rippled around the circle.</p><p>Rio’s expression hadn’t changed. But her hand  — the one clasped behind her back — had curled into a fist.</p><p>“Three,” she said evenly.</p><p>“Four.”</p><p>“Five million,” Rio said, her voice like riverstone — smooth, unyielding. She paused, then with icy finality. “In <em>crowns</em>.”</p><p>The room stilled — not just at the number, but at the currency.</p><p>Rio let it hang in the air before adding. “And if anyone would like to challenge that…I can bring it up to ten.”</p><p>The chamber went silent. Even the river seemed to still.</p><p>No one countered. No one dared. </p><p>A soft chime marked the close of the auction. </p><p>For a long moment, Rio simply stood there, staring into the glassy water where the girl’s image had been. Her reflection rippled faintly — and for the briefest second, she thought she saw a flicker of something in her own eyes.</p><p>Not anger. Not duty.</p><p>Something older. Something <em>alive</em>.</p><hr/><p>The glass beneath her feet dissolved back into water.</p><p>Rio didn’t move. The air around her still hummed faintly with the echo of the ritual — the faint metallic tang of magic lingering in her throat. Then the vision broke entirely, and she was back in her own chamber, the riverlight dimming to a low, steady pulse in the pool.</p><p>Lilia was still there, waiting in silence. She didn’t need to ask who had won.</p><p>Rio straightened, brushing invisible dust from her sleeves. “Have the council draw up the necessary documentation. I’ve seen enough for one evening.”</p><p>Lilia hesitated. “You bid rather high.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze slid toward her. “Did I?”</p><p>“You did,” Lilia said gently. “Even for you.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched — not quite a smile. “It’s not as if we can’t afford it. The treasury could fund ten such dowries and still have gold to pave the streets. Let them call it an act of generosity.”</p><p>Lilia’s brow furrowed. “And the girl? You do realize this means you actually have to marry her. She’ll be living here. With you. In close proximity.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened slightly. “She’ll adapt.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze softened. “She’s not the one I’m worried about.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked up, cold and sharp. “Is this not what you wanted? Well, it’s done now. So please, let us carry on.”</p><p>She turned away, her tone final. “Dismiss the attendants. And tell the council not to disturb me until morning.”</p><p>Lilia bowed, the faintest sigh escaping her as she left. The door closed with a soft click, and silence reclaimed the room.</p><p>Rio lingered a moment longer by the pool. The surface had stilled completely now, clear as glass. She could almost see through it — to the source, to the current that bound them all.</p><p><em>A life for a price.</em></p><p>She had paid steeper costs for lesser causes.</p><p>This should’ve meant nothing. Another transaction. Another pawn on the board. And yet, her stomach turned.</p><p>She didn’t know what disgusted her more — the system that allowed it, or the fact that she’d played along.</p><hr/><p>It had been a week since her father’s funeral. A week since she was informed that her hand would be traded for the sake of the kingdom.</p><p>With each passing day, Agatha had secretly hoped they would call it off. That no one would bid. Who would want her, anyway? She was nothing special.</p><p>The knock came at dawn.</p><p>When the door opened, it wasn’t Jen or a maid — it was her mother.</p><p>That alone was enough to sour her stomach.</p><p>“Get up,” her mother said curtly, stepping inside without invitation. The morning light caught the edge of her jewels — far too many for a woman still pretending to mourn. “It’s done.”</p><p>Agatha sat up slowly, her heart already sinking. “What is?” Though a sick feeling had begun curling in her gut, she already knew.</p><p>“The auction,” her mother said, her tone brisk, satisfied. “The council received the final documentation late last night. You’ve been won.”</p><p>The words landed like a stone in her chest. </p><p>“Won,” Agatha repeated, hollowly. “By whom?”</p><p>Her mother smiled — a smile that held no joy. “Lady Death herself.”</p><p>The name stole the air from the room. Agatha blinked, sure she’d misheard. “Who?”</p><p>“Lady Death,” her mother repeated, savoring the words like fine wine. “The infamous Queen of the Riverlands. Bid five million crowns for you — nearly offered ten by the sound of it. The council is ecstatic.”</p><p>Agatha stared. “Five million crowns? For <em>me</em>?”</p><p>Her mother’s tone turned almost gleeful. “I’ll admit I was… disappointed to hear it was a woman. But for that kind of coin?” She gave a dismissive shrug. “We’d be fools to protest. Her queendom is rich beyond reason. Mines, trade ports, farmland, river routes. And with her protection, no one will dare touch us. Our enemies will think twice before crossing House Harkness now.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice wavered. “You don’t sound particularly horrified by the idea of handing me over to a woman known for killing her enemies without blinking.”</p><p>Her mother shrugged, all feigned grace and real cruelty. “If she kills you, at least you’ll die useful. And if she doesn’t…” She gave a dry, pointed glance. “Perhaps you’ll finally learn to keep that mouth of yours shut.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into her palms. “You hate me that much?”</p><p>“I ought to have left you in the woods the moment you were born.” Her voice was steady, indifferent. “But look at you now. A good investment, in the end.”</p><p>The air seemed to crack around them.</p><p>It was suddenly all too much. Agatha could barely hear over the roar in her ears — her pulse, her breath, the sudden crash of everything crashing down at once.</p><p>Lady Death.</p><p>The most feared woman in the western realms. A monster of blood and stone. A name whispered like a curse.</p><p>And she was to <em>marry</em> her.</p><p>Her voice trembled. “Why would she even want me? She doesn’t know me. I’m no one. I have nothing.”</p><p>“Apparently, she disagrees,” her mother said, turning toward the door. “Be grateful. You’ll be well kept in her halls — assuming you manage to please her. I imagine her generosity only extends so far.”</p><p>Whispers she’d heard over the years returned in flashes. A queen who ruled alone, who had no court, no consort. Who could silence a room with a glance.</p><p>Who was said to have paid a price for her throne so steep, some said the River itself had turned from her. Or perhaps had claimed her altogether.</p><p>The idea of being married to someone like that, bound to her, trapped in her court, sent a wave of panic so sharp it made Agatha’s vision swim.</p><p>She pushed to her feet before her mother could say another word.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She was already halfway to the door.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Her mother’s voice followed her down the corridor, but Agatha was running — through the marble hallways, past startled guards, out through the open courtyard where frost still clung to the grass.</p><p>“Should we bring her back, my lady?” a guard asked as she vanished beyond the gate.</p><p>Her mother’s lip curled. “Let her go. She cannot outrun this. The deal is done.”</p><hr/><p>The cold air burned Agatha’s lungs by the time she reached the riverbank. Her feet were caked in mud, her nightgown clinging to her legs. She didn’t care.</p><p>The water gleamed silver beneath the rising sun — the same river that had always called to her when she felt trapped, whispering of escape, of freedom.</p><p>Now it only mocked her.</p><p>“Why would she do this?” she gasped, gripping the edge of the stones. “Why me? She doesn’t even know me. What does she want from me?”</p><p>Her voice cracked on the last word.</p><p>Agatha collapsed to her knees on the bank, her breath ragged. Her hands gripped the stones lining the edge. She leaned over the water, staring into her reflection. </p><p>Pale lips. Blotchy cheeks. Wind tangled hair.</p><p><em>She clearly doesn’t know what she’s buying,</em> Agatha thought bitterly.</p><p>She closed her eyes. Held her breath.</p><p>Not long. Just enough for the silence to settle in.</p><p>For the world to dim. For it to feel like something was in her control.</p><p>It was a habit she never spoke of. One she’d carried since childhood. When things got too loud inside her head, she held her breath until her body demanded to be heard again. Until it reminded her she was still here. Still herself. Even when everything else was not.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>She gasped—half from the shout, half from the burn in her lungs. She turned sharply, blinking away dizziness.</p><p>Jen came into view, picking her way down the slope in boots far too nice for the mud. A thick wool cloak was clutched in her arms. Her eyes widened as she caught sight of Agatha kneeling in the frost dusted earth.</p><p>“I heard you ran out in nothing but your nightgown. Are you trying to freeze to death?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She just shook her head and looked away.</p><p>Jen crouched beside her and immediately began wrapping the cloak around her shoulders. “You’re freezing.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was hoarse. “It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“It matters to me,” Jen snapped, but gently. “You weren’t even wearing shoes.”</p><p>Agatha laughed weakly. “I didn’t plan on coming back.”</p><p>Jen paused. “Don’t say that.”</p><p>“I can’t—” Agatha’s chest hitched. “I can’t go there. You don’t understand what they say about her—she’s cruel, ruthless, I’ve heard she kills her own council members if they so much as defy her! What do you think she’ll do to <em>me</em>?”</p><p>Jen held her tighter. “You don’t know that. They say a lot of things about powerful women. Most of them aren’t true.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was small. “And what if they are?”</p><p>Jen swallowed, her voice gentler now. “Then you’ll do what you’ve always done. You’ll survive.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands trembled in hers. “I don’t want to just survive.”</p><p>“I know.” Jen gave a faint, watery smile. “But maybe this isn’t a curse. Maybe it’s a door you didn’t see coming.”</p><p>She hesitated, then added with a teasing lilt, “Maybe you’ll even meet your soulmate while you’re over there. And run away together.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, the sound choked and half tearful. “Oh please. What are the chances of that ever happening? When’s the last time you actually met two soulmates, Jen?”</p><p>“You never know,” Jen continued, brushing a windblown strand of hair out of her face. “If anyone deserves one, it’s you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, letting her weight fall against Jen’s side. The warmth of the cloak, the quiet hush of the river, the steady rhythm of her best friend’s breathing — it was the first thing that had made her feel remotely safe all morning.</p><p>She didn’t believe it. Not really.</p><p>But for now, she let herself pretend.</p><p> </p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Rio — The Road by the Rivers Bend </em></p><p dir="ltr">The carriage rocked gently beneath her, each wheel turn muffled by the dense forest soil. Outside, the River of Life followed beside them. From where she sat it resembled a pale ribbon of silver light, threading its way through the trees. A silent companion. Familiar. Constant.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike what lay ahead. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio sat still, spine rigid against the cushioned backrest, gloved hands resting atop one another. She had not moved in over an hour. The silence inside the carriage suited her. No friends rode with her. No family. She was surrounded only by an entourage of her own choosing. Diplomats, scribes and silent eyed witnesses. Each travelling in separate compartments, with their own scrolls and opinions. None of them would speak to her unless summoned. </p><p dir="ltr">Just as she preferred. </p><p dir="ltr">She had left Lilia and Alice behind — officially so they could maintain order and oversee council affairs in her absence. But privately, it had been a calculated retreat. The fewer familiar faces she brought to this union, the less risk she ran of it feeling like anything more than it was. A deal. A duty.</p><p dir="ltr">She watched the river for a while longer, following the way it caught sunlight in flashes. At one bend, it narrowed — close enough that, had she been on horseback, she might have ridden beside it. <em>Free. Quick. Breathing</em>. Her fingers twitched toward the curtain’s edge. </p><p dir="ltr">But the thought passed. </p><p dir="ltr">She would not ride today.</p><p dir="ltr">She was not here to feel.</p><p dir="ltr">She was here to marry a stranger.</p><p dir="ltr">A diplomatic arrangement, nothing more.</p><p dir="ltr">She’d repeated it to herself again and again over the past month — while preparations had surged forward with rapt speed, while the weight of her choices settled heavier each night.</p><p dir="ltr">She was to marry a stranger. </p><p dir="ltr">A woman she had never seen in person, whose voice she had never heard so much as a cadence of.</p><p dir="ltr">She knew nothing of the girl beyond what had been documented. Agatha Harkness, nineteen. Only daughter of House Harkness. Spirit witch. Unseen. <em>Her soon to be wife</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">The thought twisted something low in her gut. </p><p dir="ltr">What was worse though, was that she couldn’t help but imagine how the girl felt. It was <em>her</em> after all that had been bartered like a prized mare. <em>Her</em> agency that had been signed away. <em>Her</em> birthright denied. </p><p dir="ltr">However sick Rio felt about the arrangement, she knew in her marrow thaw it was worse for the woman on the other end of the bargain. </p><p dir="ltr">And that knowledge — that <em>guilt</em> — had been slowly eating away at her.</p><p dir="ltr">Day after day.</p><p dir="ltr">Night after night.</p><p dir="ltr">Because Rio had once lived through something not so different. Not in name. Not in ceremony. But close enough that the shape of it still echoed in her bones.</p><p dir="ltr">She had clawed her way out of that fate.</p><p dir="ltr">And now, in carving peace for her people , she had helped drag someone else into it.</p><p dir="ltr">So now, as she sat here — en route to what would mark not only a new era in her life, but for two nations, she felt… hollow. As though the guilt had devoured everything inside and left only a quiet, efficient carcass behind.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t get to feel anything. Not when it was her hand that sealed the deal. </p><p dir="ltr">The carriage tilted slightly as the road shifted upward, the forest beginning to thin. In the distance, sharp golden spires pierced the skyline like spears. The Harkness kingdom. Pale stone towers. Silk banners. Glittering illusions dressed in performative respectability.</p><p dir="ltr">It didn’t feel welcoming.</p><p dir="ltr">Not dangerous, exactly — but sharpened. All polish and spectacle. A kingdom that wore its refinement like armor. She could already feel the eyes that would greet her there. Reverent, watchful. Rapacious. </p><p dir="ltr">She did not slow her breathing.</p><p dir="ltr">She did not look away.</p><p dir="ltr">A voice called from the front — the courier riding ahead.</p><p dir="ltr">“Your Majesty, the gates are within sight.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t answer. She adjusted the cuffs of her dark riding jacket. It was formal enough for travel, her crest stamped in silver at the shoulder — a river stone bound by throned vines. She let her hand rest near the dagger strapped to her thigh, hidden beneath the folds of her coat. Ceremonial, of course. Everything about this was.</p><p dir="ltr">But still. She liked the weight of it.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><em>Agatha — The Dressmaker’s Room</em></p><p dir="ltr">The pins kept catching her skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Not enough to bleed. Just enough to sting.</p><p dir="ltr">She stood on the low platform at the center of the room, arms half raised, gown half sewn, while four women fluttered around her like moths to a flame she never asked to be lit. Fabric rustled. Scissors clicked. Fingers tugged at laces and thread and pearls until her shoulders burned.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha stared at the far wall, blinking slowly, letting the blur take over.</p><p dir="ltr">Someone adjusted the bodice again — too tight, always too tight. A voice tsked low behind her.</p><p dir="ltr">“She’s breathing wrong again.”</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">She was just breathing.</p><p dir="ltr">Too much, apparently.</p><p dir="ltr">Her mother sat in the corner, supervising with all the warmth of a frozen statue. She didn’t say much, just nodded sharply when a seamstress asked something, or made quiet suggestions like <em>“we’ll need to cinch the waist further” </em>and<em> “the shoulders must be corrected — it’s looking rather hunched.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s legs ached. Her stomach growled softly, and one of the women made a face.</p><p dir="ltr">“What did she eat this morning?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Just fruit,” one replied. “And watered tea.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Make sure she avoids anything heavier until the ceremony,” her mother cut in. “The dress won’t forgive it.”</p><p dir="ltr">The dress. As if it were sacred. As if <em>she</em> were not.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t respond. She hadn’t responded in nearly an hour.</p><p dir="ltr">Not since she had made one comment too many, and her mother had squeezed her cheeks together and hissed at her to shut her mouth. </p><p dir="ltr">Hard enough for tears to spring up. </p><p dir="ltr">Not hard enough to bruise. </p><p dir="ltr">Never hard enough to bruise — at least not since the countdown to the wedding had started and she couldn’t risk “damaging the prize”.</p><p dir="ltr">Her fingertips flexed slightly, then curled into fists at her sides.</p><p dir="ltr">When she was small, she used to pretend her body was a shell. That she could step out of it if she needed to — leave it behind, weightless and invisible. She hadn’t done that in years.</p><p dir="ltr">She found herself doing it now.</p><p dir="ltr">They pulled at her again. Another adjustment. Another pin. Another murmur about her posture, her hips, her expression.</p><p dir="ltr">“Try to soften your mouth. No one likes a bitter bride.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Lift your chin. Not so much. You dont want to look as if you’re challenging anyone.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Try not to squint like that at the alter. You look like you’re glaring.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t fidget.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t slouch.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Don’t exist</em>, she thought, and that made her laugh — not aloud, just inside. Quiet and bitter. Like everything else about her.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t notice she was holding her breath until her vision narrowed.</p><p dir="ltr">She let the breath go slowly. Shallow. Silent.</p><p dir="ltr">No one noticed.</p><p dir="ltr">No one ever did.</p><p dir="ltr">A knock at the door pulled her out of her thoughts. A young maid entered a curtseyed low, eyes downcast. </p><p dir="ltr">“What is it, girl? Speak.” Her mother snapped impatiently.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m sorry to disturb, Your Grace, I was sent to inform you Her Majesty Queen Vidal and her entourage have arrived. They await your presence.” The girl rushed out.</p><p dir="ltr">“Why didn’t you say that earlier. Oh,I must go greet them. How do I look.” </p><p dir="ltr">“Beautiful as always your Grace.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course,” Her mother said brushing her hair back vainly before tuning to face Agatha. “Make you she is kept far away from the Queen at all times until the wedding. I will not have anything spoiling this deal.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course, Your Grace,” came the chorus.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Perhaps she fears if she sees me up close before the wedding, she’ll call it off and high tail home,</em> Agatha thought to herself. </p><p dir="ltr">With her mother gone, the women got back to work with their poking and prodding. </p><p dir="ltr">When they finally stepped away, admiring their work, she glanced at her reflection in the tall mirror across the room.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t look like a bride.</p><p dir="ltr">She looked like a gift.</p><p dir="ltr">All wrapped up and ready to be given away.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><em>Rio —The Council Chamber</em></p><p dir="ltr">The chamber was colder than it needed to be.</p><p dir="ltr">Not cold in temperature but cold in <em>design</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Walls too high, windows too narrow, air too still. Even the paintings on the walls were stiff with self importance. Past rulers with sharp eyes and thin mouths peered down at them from their gilded frames. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio sat at one end of the long table, back straight, boots planted, gloved hands resting in her lap. Her officials stood behind her, silent and alert. </p><p dir="ltr">They weren’t the ones being watched though. </p><p dir="ltr">No— <em>she</em> was. Every inch of her. </p><p dir="ltr">The gathered council members did little to hide their stares. From the old men in embroidered robes, to the younger scribes and few hawk eyed noblewomen. Their whispers had grown louder the longer she sat there. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Taller than I expected.” “Is that a sword at her hip?”  </em><em>“A queen wearing trousers?” “She’d be a lot prettier if she smiled.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t flinch.</p><p dir="ltr">Didn’t turn to look at them.</p><p dir="ltr">Didn’t let her mouth tighten, even though she wanted to.</p><p dir="ltr">Let them gawk. Let them weigh her like livestock at a market. She had been stared at by worse men, and she had killed most of them.</p><p dir="ltr">The doors opened with a theatrical sweep of air and perfume.</p><p dir="ltr">Evanora Harkness swept into the room like it belonged to her. With sweeping black silk, beaded shoulders, and practiced elegance. She smiled at everyone, nodded to no one, and took her seat with the grace of a woman who had spent her life expecting obedience.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t stand.</p><p dir="ltr">The room fell quiet.</p><p dir="ltr">“Queen Vidal,” Evanora purred, offering no bow, no greeting beyond the name. “What an honour to finally welcome you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Likewise,” Rio replied coolly. “Though I notice we are not all present.”</p><p dir="ltr">Evanora blinked once.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m sorry?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Your daughter,” Rio said, voice still polite but edged with steel. “Will she not be joining us for this meeting?”</p><p dir="ltr">There was a flicker of surprise around the table. A few exchanged glances. One of the councilmen coughed into his sleeve.</p><p dir="ltr">Evanora tilted her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, it’s simply customary, that the bride remain unseen by the groom — or should I say the…<em>other</em> bride, before the wedding. It’s quite sacred, you understand.”</p><p dir="ltr">She smiled sweetly — the kind of sweetness that reeked of rot.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s eyes narrowed, just slightly, at the evident dig. Same gender marriages were common among her people. But she knew this was a more…<em>traditional</em> Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Still that was not what irked her most about the response.</p><p dir="ltr">“This meeting contains matters that concern her directly though, does it not?”</p><p dir="ltr">A few chuckled. In the uncomfortable, patronising way that always made her want to snap a blade in half.</p><p dir="ltr">“The princess has never taken much interest in political affairs,” one of them said.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s all quite beyond her, really,” added another.</p><p dir="ltr">“Best not to burden the poor girl.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio said nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">But her jaw tensed, just once.</p><p dir="ltr">The meeting began in full. Papers were produced. Terms laid out. Formalities exchanged.</p><p dir="ltr">Trade routes would be opened. Titles merged. Dowries restructured. Troop pathways revised.</p><p dir="ltr">All decided without the woman she was to marry in the room.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet they spoke about her constantly.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“The girl’s dowry lands have been reassessed, of course.”</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>“As her…spouse, you’ll assume full inheritance of her holdings.”</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>“The girl is Unseen of course but with how strong your magic is, I have no doubt any heirs produced will be of the Seen.” </em></p><p dir="ltr">The words slide across the table like a knife on silk.</p><p dir="ltr">They stirred something inside her — not just a flash of anger. Something colder. Sharper. Older than rage.</p><p dir="ltr">She knew the tone well — that offhanded calculation dressed up in pleasantry. The kind used by generals when measuring casualties. By kings when selling daughters. By the same kind of men who once spoke of her bloodline with too much interest and not enough humanity.</p><p dir="ltr">They weren’t speaking of <em>children</em>. Not truly.</p><p dir="ltr">They were speaking of assets. Magical yield. Inheritance potential.</p><p dir="ltr">They spoke of the woman she was to marry as if her <em>Unseen nature</em> made her lesser, incomplete. A problem to be corrected by Rio’s blood.</p><p dir="ltr">And worse still, they assumed Rio would comply. That she would lay her body beside hers for the sake of lineage, power, <em>legacy</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">As if her womb were part of the treaty.</p><p dir="ltr">“I was not made aware that children were a condition of the treaty,” she said, voice even — a deadly kind of even.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a pause. A ripple. Just long enough to register that something had shifted in the room.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, nothing so crude, of course,” Evanora said with a smile that made Rio’s spine itch. “But it would be expected — eventually. Such a union should bear fruit, don’t you agree?”</p><p dir="ltr">The room chuckled again.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">She considered speaking — considered saying that the strength of magic was not measured by birthright, or power, or whether a child came from the Seen or the Unseen.</p><p dir="ltr">But she didn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">Not yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Let them believe her silence was diplomacy. Not disdain.</p><p dir="ltr">             ————————</p><p dir="ltr">After countless more negotiations and half veiled insults, at very last, the documents were drawn, the niceties were finished and the ink was drying.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you for your time, Your Majesty,” Evanora said, rising to her feet like a curtain call. “You’ll want to rest, I imagine. There will be a dinner this evening — a celebration of the alliance. You’ll be formally presented to the full court.”</p><p dir="ltr">A servant was summoned.</p><p dir="ltr">“Please escort Queen Vidal to her chambers. Her suite has been prepared.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio stood, adjusting her gloves.</p><p dir="ltr">“See to it my staff are settled nearby,” she said. “And ensure I am not disturbed.”</p><p dir="ltr">The servant bowed low.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p><p dir="ltr">She walked out without another word, the air in the chamber clinging to her like dust.</p><p dir="ltr">Behind her, the council resumed murmuring.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><em>Agatha — The Cleansing Ritual</em></p><p dir="ltr">The chamber smelled of rosewater and smoke.</p><p dir="ltr">Steam clung to the air like a second skin, thick and sticky, clouding the silver mirrors that lined the marble walls. She sat naked on a low stone stool as instructed, spine straight, legs tucked beneath her, as half a dozen women moved around her in silence, each one wrapped in white cloths that stayed dry while she remained drenched.</p><p dir="ltr">This wasn’t a bath.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a performance.</p><p dir="ltr">A purge.</p><p dir="ltr">One of her mother’s ladies — Dama Calis, the oldest and most severe — oversaw the entire thing in her mother’s absence, her bony arms folded, lips drawn thin as a blade. “Higher,” she snapped when Agatha’s chin dipped. “You are to be presented as royalty, not slouching like a peasant girl.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha obeyed, lifting her head. The steam made her dizzy. Sweat dripped into her eyes, but it was hard to tell what was sweat and what were tears.</p><p dir="ltr">They were careful never to speak to her directly unless correcting her posture or chastising a flinch. Though who could blame her? The cloths they used were harsh, and the scrubbing left her skin raw, stinging like a burn.</p><p dir="ltr">When she tried to shift away from one of them brushing too close to her chest, Calis narrowed her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sit still. You are not a child.”</p><p dir="ltr">The shame sank deeper than the heat.</p><p dir="ltr">They poured water over her again. Not warm. Not gentle. Not sacred. It felt more procedural. Almost punishing. </p><p dir="ltr">Her hair was unbraided, then oiled, then combed out too roughly. Her scalp ached.</p><p dir="ltr">Her fingertips dug into the sides of the stool.</p><p dir="ltr">This was supposed to make her clean. Worthy. Holy.</p><p dir="ltr">But all she felt was scrubbed down to bone, like they were trying to erase something that refused to vanish.</p><p dir="ltr">She kept her eyes fixed on a crack in the wall, some barely visible line in the tile, and counted the seconds between each rinse. One… two… three… breathe.</p><p dir="ltr">The heat was too much. Her lungs felt swollen with it. She tried to take a deeper breath and failed.</p><p dir="ltr">Stillness. Obedience. Endurance.</p><p dir="ltr">That’s what they taught you.</p><p dir="ltr">That’s what makes you good.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the cloths scraped over her back again, harder than necessary. She gasped.</p><p dir="ltr">“Stop fidgeting,” Calis barked. “A queen does not wince.”</p><p dir="ltr">She said nothing. She was exhausted and had learned by now that silence was sometimes safer.</p><p dir="ltr">But as more water was poured over her — scalding this time — her throat tightened. She blinked against the steam. Her cheeks were already wet. She let them think it was just from the water.</p><p dir="ltr">They wouldn’t care either way.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><em>Rio — The Call Home </em></p><p dir="ltr">The guest chambers were too warm. The fire roared in the far end of the room, completely unnecessary for the time of the day. She put it out as soon as her escort had left. As she always did. </p><p dir="ltr">The room itself was suffocating enough without the extra heat. The sickly sweet scent of perfume clung to the air like rot disguised as roses. Silk and lace adorned every surface. — the cushions, the walls, even the towering tapestry behind the bed — all in pale, muted colourings, whites and greys and soft creams. No contrast. No grounding feel. It was as though someone had tried to lull her into a docile state of femininity by way of decor.</p><p dir="ltr">She hated it.</p><p dir="ltr">She sat on the floor now, cross legged, spine straight, trying to steady her breathing.</p><p dir="ltr">Breathe in.</p><p dir="ltr">Breathe out.</p><p dir="ltr">Release the tension.</p><p dir="ltr">Do not kill anyone.</p><p dir="ltr">She tried to follow Lilia’s teachings. Tried to follow the rhythm of her breath to the pull of the River. But her chest was tight. Her jaw ached from clenching.</p><p dir="ltr">It didn’t help.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, she relented and rose. She crossed the room in slow deliberate steps and reached into her satchel. Her fingers curled around the smooth metal of her personal mirror — a travel sized disc, etched with runes along its bronze edge, the surface dark obsidian.</p><p dir="ltr">She knelt at the low table, set the mirror flat, and traced her fingertip over the main sigil. It flared briefly. </p><p dir="ltr">She leaned in and murmured the activation spell.</p><p dir="ltr">The surface rippled like water. A heartbeat later, Lilia’s familiar face appeared with a gentle smile and soft eyes, silver hair twisted into her usual knot. She was seated in her office, lamplight casting soft shadows across her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“I expected you’d call around now,” Lilia said.</p><p dir="ltr">“Did the River whisper that?”</p><p dir="ltr">“No, I just know you well.”</p><p dir="ltr">The corners of Rio’s mouth twitched. Barely.</p><p dir="ltr">“And I know that face of yours,” Lilia added, tilting her head. “You’re concerned.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Im not…concerned.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You sound rather concerned.” </p><p dir="ltr">A second face crowded the mirror — Alice, grinning like a fox with too much time and far too little sense of responsibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio exhaled through her nose. “This place is just..off.”</p><p dir="ltr">Lilia’s expression sharpened slightly.”Off how?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Cold,” she said. “Not literally but spiritually . It’s all… stiff tradition, and overly polite falseness. Everything smells like dust covered in honey. I don’t trust any of it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“That sounds about right,” Lilia said. “It’s an old court. Built on appearances and alliances. Nothing genuine survives here long.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s fingers tapped once against the table. “I haven’t even seen her.”</p><p dir="ltr">“The girl?” Lilia asked.</p><p dir="ltr">She nodded. “Not a glimpse.”</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s to be expected,” Lilia said. “They’re most likely observing a pre-wedding rite. You know how it works.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes. But that doesn’t make it less eerie.” She hesitated. “I am to marry this woman tomorrow and I have only seen her reflection in a projection once. It’s strange.”</p><p dir="ltr">Lilia tilted her head. “Do you wish to see her?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t say that.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You didn’t deny it either.” Alice smile widened in the mirror. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio ignored her. “I just think it’s wrong that she is being excluded from conversations that directly regard her future.”</p><p dir="ltr">Lilia didn’t speak for a while she simply watered at her, long and contemplative. “That’s not all that’s bothering you though. Is it?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio hesitated. Then quietly she responded. “They’ve already begun speaking of heirs.”</p><p dir="ltr">There was a beat of silence. </p><p dir="ltr">Alice’s face vanished from the mirror like she’d been pulled away. </p><p dir="ltr">Lilia didn’t speak. Her eyes simply studied Rio’s face assessing.</p><p dir="ltr">“You didn’t mention that would be part of the treaty,” Rio added. Her voice was low, quiet, controlled.</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t think it would be brought up this soon,” Lilia said honestly. “But I won’t insult your intelligence, Your Majesty. I believe you knew it would come eventually.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio looked away, jaw clenched.</p><p dir="ltr">Lilia continued. “You are not a woman who has ever been forced into something she didn’t choose. This will be no exception. It is a choice — yours to make.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s voice cut through the air, sharper than intended. “It’s not <em>only</em> my choice.”</p><p dir="ltr">Lilia paused. Then she smiled — not mockingly, but with something softer. Deeply proud.</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course.”</p><p dir="ltr">The silence that followed stretched almost  uncomfortably for a moment.</p><p dir="ltr">Then Lilia added gently, “You have survived harder things than a royal wedding.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded once, but her hands were tight in her lap.</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t afraid of surviving.</p><p dir="ltr">She was afraid of what surviving this would cost.</p><p dir="ltr">She turned to look away, and that’s when she caught it.</p><p dir="ltr">Just for a breath. </p><p dir="ltr">Rose water. Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">She froze. The scent clung to the air like a memory, soft and sudden, before vanishing without a trace. </p><p dir="ltr">Strange.</p><p dir="ltr">The windows were closed. The guest chambers were tucked deep in the west wing, nowhere near any baths. </p><p dir="ltr">It made no sense. </p><p dir="ltr">And yet…it stirred something in her. Something she couldn’t name.</p><p dir="ltr">A flicker. A pull. Gone as quickly as it came. </p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><em>Agatha — The Veil Fitting </em></p><p dir="ltr">They still hadn’t fed her. </p><p dir="ltr">Not properly anyways. A few pieces of dried fruit, a thin slice of dry bread. Some lukewarm broth. It did nothing to dull the cache in her stomach. That same ache now twisted inside her ribs, dull and constant, as if her body had begun consuming itself in protest.</p><p dir="ltr">She stood in the center of the room, unmoving as three women circled her, adjusting and re-fastening the veil.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t cloth. Not this time.</p><p dir="ltr">This veil clinked faintly with every breath. A fine lattice of metal — silver and gold, cool against her skin. It was delicate enough to glisten like thread, heavy enough to bruise. It draped from the circlet above her brow to the curve of her shoulders, a waterfall of tempered light and iron restraint. With each adjustment, the chainmail tightened, the links shifting, pulling, catching at the roots of her hair. It bit at her collarbone.</p><p dir="ltr">Woven with charms and twisted sigils meant to “protect” her. That’s what they said. That it was sacred. That it was tradition. That it was an honour, worn only by brides of noble blood on their wedding day. A symbol of virtue, meant to persevere her from sight until the union was sealed.</p><p dir="ltr">But she wasn’t naïve.</p><p dir="ltr">The weight of it wasn’t protection. It was ownership. Obscurity. A reminder of what she was meant to be.  Seen but not fully known.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t help but think it looked very much like a cage. </p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t even feel the cool metal anymore. Her skin had gone numb. Her scalp ached from the constant repositioning. One of the women tugged the veil again, muttering under her breath about symmetry.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t react.</p><p dir="ltr">Not when they tightened the drape around her temples. Not when the clasps dug into the base of her neck. Not even when they asked her to lift her chin again for the fifth time.</p><p dir="ltr">She had stopped flinching. Stopped arguing. Stopped asking <em>why</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Somewhere between the bath and the silence that followed, she’d learned that obedience made things faster. Less painful, if not in body then at least in spirit.</p><p dir="ltr">So she stood still. A good daughter. A quiet bride.</p><p dir="ltr">She stared at her reflection, hollow eyed and pale under the silver mesh, and wondered if anyone would even recognise her beneath it. If she even recognised herself.</p><p dir="ltr">The veil shifted slightly as the women murmured among themselves, stepping back to assess their work.</p><p dir="ltr">“Perfect,” one of them said.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha said nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">She was tired. So tired her bones felt waterlogged, her head too heavy for her spine. She didn’t remember when she’d last felt warmth that wasn’t steam or shame or hands she hadn’t invited.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t cry. She’d done enough of that earlier. Now there was only quiet, and the dull ringing of something inside her being smothered.</p><p dir="ltr">The mirror showed a figure draped in elegance. In reverence.</p><p dir="ltr">But underneath the veil, she was gone.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><em>Rio — The Banquet </em></p><p dir="ltr">She arrived exactly on time. Not a minute early. Not a second late.</p><p dir="ltr">She’d never been late to anything in her life — not battle, not council, not ceremony. That was the kind of discipline bred into her bones.</p><p dir="ltr">As the great doors creaked open, her name was formally announced. </p><p dir="ltr">“Now enters Her Royal Majesty Queen Rio Vidal, ruler of the Riverlands, Commander of the River Guard.”</p><p dir="ltr">The room fell into a hush so absolute it could’ve been a funeral. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio stood tall at the threshold, letting them look.</p><p dir="ltr">Her ensemble was calculated. Tailored obsidian robes interwoven with deep green silk, the stitching lined like veins across her shoulders and down her chest. Structured like armor but fluid like a priest’s vestments — neither dress nor uniform, neither feminine nor masculine . Deliberate.</p><p dir="ltr">The embroidery shimmered faintly when she moved, catching the firelight, but the sharpness of her silhouette left no room for softness.</p><p dir="ltr">She watched their faces closely. Most were blank with politeness. A few weren’t fast enough to hide their distaste.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Good</em>, she thought. <em>Let them choke on it.</em></p><p dir="ltr">She moved forward slowly, each step measured. The murmurs resumed the moment she passed. Forks stilled. Goblets were lowered. She could feel them staring — as though she were a wild animal who was about to bear its teeth or snarl.</p><p dir="ltr">She did neither.</p><p dir="ltr">At the long central table, she was guided to her seat. And seated to her left, of course, was Lady Harkness.</p><p dir="ltr">Her perfume was sharp, floral, something synthetic trying to mimic lilies. It clung to the air like frost.</p><p dir="ltr">“Your Majesty,” the woman greeted her, with the kind of smile that had razors hidden behind it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio inclined her head in return. “Lady Harkness.”</p><p dir="ltr">The food was brought out then — heavy platters of roasted meats, limp vegetables, sugared breads. A feast on the surface, but the flavors were dead. She chewed slowly, methodically, barely tasting it.</p><p dir="ltr">To refuse would be rude. To complain would be political.</p><p dir="ltr">So she swallowed it down, like she swallowed most things. Quietly.</p><p dir="ltr">Conversation buzzed around her like flies. Tedious stories. Bad jokes. Thinly veiled questions about her lineage, her policies, her queendom. At one point, a baron asked if she fished her own rivers. Another inquired if women were permitted to duel where she came from. She gave cool, clipped answers — never impolite, but never what they wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, she felt it — the itch of eyes on her. The small pauses in conversation when she lifted her goblet. The sideways glances. The whispers tucked behind sips of wine.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet…</p><p dir="ltr">Her gaze kept drifting, as if against her will. Of course she knew the girl would not be here. Part of the ridiculous, outdated tradition of this court. </p><p dir="ltr">It still landed stubbornly in her chest. The faintest sense of disappointment. </p><p dir="ltr">“Will your daughter be dining alone tonight?” Rio asked quietly, without turning her head.</p><p dir="ltr">Lady Harkness dabbed delicately at the corner of her mouth with a linen cloth. “Oh I’m sure she’s eaten something light.”</p><p dir="ltr">Another sip of wine. “She’ll be watching her figure though, no doubt.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s hand tightened subtly around her goblet.</p><p dir="ltr">“I understand the sentiment,” She spoke coolly. “I’d simply hope she was being cared for.”</p><p dir="ltr">A flash of teeth “Oh, she’s being prepared for you. Don’t worry.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Prepared</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio said nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">But her stomach turned.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><em>Agatha — The Aftermath </em></p><p dir="ltr">The door clicked shut behind the attendants. </p><p dir="ltr">Silence fell like a cloud of ash.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha fell into her bed and laid there for a long time, motionless. Her skin was pink and stinging, scrubbed raw beneath layers of perfumed oil and rose water. Her hair had been combed until it shone, plaited and pinned until they finally deemed her “presentable.” She’d been dressed, undressed, draped, tightened, veiled, unveiled, redressed.</p><p dir="ltr">Now she was alone. Stripped bare of ceremony, but still wearing the day like residue.</p><p dir="ltr">Her body ached. Her stomach churned</p><p dir="ltr">Her temple still felt tender from whee the chainmail veil had pressed against her skin. Her scalp throbbed. Her ribs felt too tight.</p><p dir="ltr">She felt—</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Filthy</em>. </p><p dir="ltr">In a way water couldn’t cleanse.</p><p dir="ltr">When the knock came, it was tentative. Then again. Softer.</p><p dir="ltr">“…Agatha?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Enter,” she called weakly from the bed. She had no edgy to rise.</p><p dir="ltr">The door creaked open. Jen slipped through like a shadow. She didn’t speak at first. She just looked at her. Her face folded when she saw the state of her — red rimmed eyes and colourless lips.</p><p dir="ltr">Jen moved quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">“I brought you something.” She shut the door behind her and held up a cloth bundle. “Don’t ask what it is. I stole it from the kitchens when they weren’t looking.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t answer. She didn’t trust herself to not cry.</p><p dir="ltr">Jen crossed the room, set the bundle down on the low table, and crouched beside her. She unwrapped a still warm meat pie and half an apple, sliced cleanly with a dull knife.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha sat down finally, slowly, like someone afraid their bones might break if they bent too far.</p><p dir="ltr">She reached for the food. Took a bite.</p><p dir="ltr">Chewed once. Twice. Swallowed.</p><p dir="ltr">Then shook her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“I can’t,” she whispered.</p><p dir="ltr">Jen didn’t press. Just wrapped the food again and sat back on her heels.</p><p dir="ltr">“They wouldn’t let me see you all day.”</p><p dir="ltr">“They had me quite…occupied.”</p><p dir="ltr">Silence stretched between them.</p><p dir="ltr">“I hate this place.” Agatha said at last.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know.” </p><p dir="ltr">“They’ve dressed me up like a thing. A… display. All this talk of sacred duty, and chastity, and veils, and I’m just—” Agatha trailed off, chest rising unevenly. “I’m not even a person to them anymore. I don’t think I ever was.”</p><p dir="ltr">Jen reached for her hand.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know,” she said again. “But it’s almost over.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha looked at her, eyes hollow. </p><p dir="ltr">“I mean it,” Jen said, squeezing her hand. “You’ll be a part of her court after tomorrow. And then you’ll be away from all this. They can’t hurt you anymore.” </p><p dir="ltr">“What if it’s just worse there?” Agatha whispered, fingers curling in the sheets. </p><p dir="ltr">“Then you give them hell,” Jen said firmly, her voice breaking through the hush. “And remind them who you are.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha let out a weak laugh — small, cracked, but real. “I don’t think I remember her anymore.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, you do.” Jen squeezed her hand tighter. “You’re Agatha Harkness. My best friend. A fighter. A survivor. And you don’t give up.”</p><p dir="ltr">For a moment, Agatha almost believed her.</p><p dir="ltr">She closed her eyes. Breathed in the faint scent of rose water and metal that still clung to her skin.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ll try,” she whispered.</p><p dir="ltr">Jen brushed a strand of damp hair from her face. “That’s all you ever need to do.”</p><p dir="ltr">When she eventually left, the room felt even quieter.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha lay back on the bed, staring at the canopy above her until her vision blurred.</p><p dir="ltr">Somewhere, beyond the walls, the River whispered.</p><p dir="ltr">Tomorrow, she would become someone’s wife.</p><p dir="ltr">Tonight, she was still herself—barely.</p><p dir="ltr">And that, for now, would have to be enough.</p><p> </p>

<p>The morning light was too clean.</p><p> </p><p>It sliced through the high windows in pale ribbons, silvering the steam that curled from a basin beside the bed. The palace felt hollow in the early hours, its marble halls still and watchful, as though the building itself knew what day it was.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had been awake for hours.</p><p> </p><p>The bells had started at dawn, their low toll rolling through the palace like the slow beat of a war drum. Every note reminded her what today was — what she had agreed to.</p><p> </p><p>She sat at the edge of the bed, still in her undershirt, working her thumbs over the seam of one leather glove. The material creaked softly every time she flexed. A quiet, steady rhythm. Almost enough to drown out the pulse stubbornly beating too fast beneath her collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t nerves, she told herself. Nerves were for young cadets at their first duel, for soldiers on parade, for fools who mistook desire for destiny. This was politics. Strategy. Paperwork sealed with silk and vows instead of ink.</p><p> </p><p>Still, her pulse refused to obey. It thudded traitorously under her ribs, steady and fast, as though her body hadn’t received the memo that her heart had no business being involved in today’s events.</p><p> </p><p>She rose and crossed to the window. Below, the courtyard was already a blur of motion — attendants carrying gilded trays, horses being brushed to mirror sheen, nobles weaving between banners. The whole kingdom seemed to hold its breath in anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>Rio adjusted her cuffs, then reached for the uniform hung beside the door.</p><p> </p><p>The garment waiting for her was not the soft ceremonial robes her advisors had suggested — pale silks meant to flatter, to make her look gentle and inviting. No. She had set those aside last night without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Instead she chose the other ensemble:</p><p>A dark navy coat, cut sharply at the waist.</p><p>Gold threaded embroidery climbing the collar like stylised roots.</p><p>A heavy ceremonial cloak clasped at her shoulders with two wrought gold leaf pins.</p><p>Structured, martial, unmistakable.</p><p> </p><p>The cut of a general’s uniform. A soldier’s silhouette. It carried the right message.</p><p> </p><p>Love had no place in this treaty.</p><p> </p><p>She dressed in silence, every button closed with mechanical precision. When she was done, she reached for the small mirror on the table. The woman staring back looked composed, carved from calm. No one would know she hadn’t slept. No one would see that the hollowness behind her eyes was not from boredom, but from the faint, inexplicable tremor that kept catching her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand drifted, almost unconsciously, to the space above her heart.</p><p> </p><p>The place where, in stories, a soulmark would burn if fate ever laid claim to her.</p><p> </p><p>Children loved those tales — the spark, the instant recognition, the bond deeper than blood. She had loved them once too, before she learned what they meant for someone in her position. Before she was old enough to understand that a soulmate for a queen was not a blessing but a disaster waiting to happen.</p><p> </p><p>A monarch bound by magic was a monarch compromised.</p><p> </p><p>A queen in love was a queen controllable.</p><p> </p><p>The court whispered it often enough<em>. Better for the throne if she never burned at all.</em> Better that her chest stay cool and untouched, her heart loyal only to the crown. Better that she never gave the people — or her enemies — someone they could pry from her.</p><p> </p><p>She had outgrown the fantasies long ago.</p><p>Soulmates were for dreamers and poets.</p><p>Not for women who built queendoms from ash.</p><p> </p><p>Still, her palm lingered there a moment longer than it should have. The space beneath her hand felt too alive, too aware. She pulled her hand away as though burned.</p><p> </p><p>She frowned.</p><p> </p><p>A knock at the door broke the quiet. One of her aides entered — a young diplomat assigned to oversee the formalities. He bowed deeply, eyes flicking nervously over her attire.</p><p> </p><p>“Your Majesty, they’re readying the hall.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio inclined her head, voice steady. “I’ll be there shortly.”</p><p> </p><p>When he left, she exhaled. It was not quite a sigh, more a slow release of pressure. The silence folded around her again, thick and waiting.</p><p> </p><p>She slipped on her gloves at last. The leather molded perfectly to her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, another bell tolled — lower, heavier. The sound echoed the her sternum.</p><p> </p><p>Rio straightened, squared her shoulders, and forced her heartbeat to slow.</p><p> </p><p>She had faced sieges with steadier hands than this.</p><p> </p><p>Yet as she stood there it felt as though she were preparing to walk straight into fire.</p><p> </p><p>———-</p><p> </p><p>The corset was too tight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s first thought when they finished pulling on the laces that morning was that it felt as though her chest had been bound with iron. The second was that she was going to be sick.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Jen reached her, she was already doubled over the basin, trembling. Nothing came up—there was nothing in her to give—but her body kept trying, convulsing with dry, shuddering heaves that tore at her throat. The room spun, candlelight bleeding against white walls.</p><p> </p><p>“Breathe,” Jen murmured, pressing a cool hand between her shoulder blades. “It’s all right, it’s just nerves—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, gripping the rim of the basin until her knuckles blanched. The air refused to come. It scraped at her throat in small, useless gulps.</p><p> </p><p>Jen had actually managed to sneak in that morning to Agatha’s surprise. Her mother was too busy running in and out of rooms, barking orders and demanding perfection from everyone within earshot to notice the intrusion.</p><p> </p><p>And as though the mere thought of her mother was enough to summon her, the woman appeared in the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>“I was told she would be dressed already,” came her mother’s grating voice. “Why isn’t she standing?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother swept into the room like a gust of cold wind, silk skirts whispering against the floor. Her gaze cut through everything—through Jen, through Agatha’s trembling hands, through the quiet plea caught in her daughter’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>“Get up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mother, I—”</p><p> </p><p>“Enough.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen tried to protest—something about the corset being too tight—but was silenced with a glance. The older woman crossed the room in two measured steps and caught Agatha’s chin in her hand. Her perfume smelled of crushed roses and iron.</p><p> </p><p>“You will not shame this family with theatrics,” she said. “You will walk. You will smile. You will thank her for saving you from spinsterhood, and you will not make a spectacle of yourself. Do you understand?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded because it was easier.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother released her with a small sound of disgust and left as swiftly as she had come. The door clicked shut, leaving only the ringing in Agatha’s ears.</p><p> </p><p>Jen hovered beside her, wringing her hands. “Try slow breaths. In—out—”</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha had already slipped into the rhythm she knew best.</p><p>She closed her eyes and held her breath. One, two, three, four—</p><p>Her chest burned. The world blurred.</p><p>Five, six—</p><p>Her mind quieted. Control reclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>She let the air out carefully, steadying her shaking hands.</p><p> </p><p>When she opened her eyes again, the maids had returned — three of them, faces expressionless as they entered carrying boxes, brushes, and a small tray of jewels. The air filled with the scent of starch and metal polish.</p><p> </p><p>They descended on her with mechanical precision.</p><p> </p><p>First came the underskirts, layer after layer until she could barely move. The weight gathered around her hips, pulling her backward as though the dress itself were trying to swallow her. Then the gown — silk, embroidered with gold thread that caught the candlelight in cruel flashes. It was beautiful, objectively. A work of art, the kind meant to be admired, not inhabited.</p><p> </p><p>The maids tugged and pinned and adjusted. Her arms were raised, lowered, turned, spun. Someone brushed powder over her collarbones, another painted her lips the colour of wilted roses. The smallest one knelt to fasten pearl buttons up her sleeves, murmuring apologies each time the fabric caught her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood motionless through it all, letting them dress her like a doll. Each tug, each fastening stole another inch of breath. By the time they were done, her body no longer felt like her own—it belonged to the gown, to the performance.</p><p> </p><p>Her hair came next. Jen took over there, working  in silence, combing it through trembling fingers, weaving braids into soft coils. The pins bit into her scalp until she stopped flinching.</p><p> </p><p>“There,” Jen whispered eventually, stepping back. “Perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>Perfect. The word rang hollow in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>The room had grown too bright. Candlelight bounced off every mirrored surface, splintering her reflection into half a dozen versions of herself. Pale, still, obedient. The only movement was the slow rise and fall of her chest as she fought for shallow breaths beneath the corset’s vice.</p><p> </p><p>The veil waited folded on the dressing table — chainmail so fine it glittered like frost. When placed over her face, she would be unseen, unheard, owned.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s hands were gentle as she adjusted the gown’s neckline, trying to smile. “It’ll be over soon. Just remember to keep your chin up, all right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, eyes fixed on her reflection. Her mouth curved into something that might have been a smile if not for the tremor running through it.</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl,” Jen murmured. “You look beautiful.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could almost laugh at the absurdity of it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze flicked to the veil again. To the gloves lying beside it. To the spot at her wrist where the cords would soon tie. She thought of the hall beyond these walls, of the stranger waiting there — her future carved into treaty parchment.</p><p> </p><p>The air pressed in.</p><p> </p><p>One of the maids knocked lightly on the doorframe. “It’s time, my lady.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen squeezed her hand once, as if she could anchor her. “You can do this,” she said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded,  though she wasn’t sure who she was agreeing with.</p><p> </p><p>For a heartbeat, she almost tore the dress apart just to breathe.</p><p>To ruin it. To ruin everything.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she straightened her spine the way her mother had taught her. Counted to six. Smoothed her skirt.</p><p> </p><p>The veil came down last. The world dimmed.</p><p> </p><p>Sound narrowed to the whisper of fabric and the steady thud of her heart.</p><p> </p><p>Each step toward the great doors felt heavier than the last.</p><p> </p><p>When they opened before her—revealing the endless marble aisle, the sea of strangers, the waiting queen at the altar—Agatha finally understood what her mother had meant by <em>spectacle</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The entire kingdom had gathered to watch her disappear.</p><p> </p><p>And for a moment, she almost did.</p><p> </p><p>——</p><p> </p><p>The hall was too quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Not silent. No, silence would have been mercy. This was the kind of quiet that hummed, filled with the low murmur of anticipation and the brittle weight of expectation. Every cough, every shuffle of feet echoed like a drumbeat through the vaulted ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood at the altar, hands clasped loosely behind her back, the faint scent of candle smoke and river incense coiling in the air.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator — a tall, gaunt figure draped in the silver vestments of the River Order — stood at her right. His voice flowed in the old cadence of the binding rites, each line steady and low, crafted to soothe the River as much as to instruct the living. Verses about devotion, surrender, continuity — words Rio knew by heart long before she ever wore a crown.</p><p> </p><p>The sigil on his robes caught the candlelight.</p><p>The River’s sigil.</p><p> </p><p>It glowed faintly, alive with that familiar pulse she had been taught to welcome — a presence she had once believed watched over her. Guided her. Carried her family. Took them, too.</p><p> </p><p>A presence she had spent years pretending she no longer feared.</p><p> </p><p>Her throat tightened.</p><p> </p><p>The River had made her queen. The River had guided her bloodline for generations. Whatever vows she took today, the River would take them too.</p><p> </p><p>The thought was supposed to carry comfort to her.</p><p> </p><p>But as the officiator continued, Rio realized she was barely hearing him.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze was fixed on the double doors at the far end of the aisle. Sealed shut. Still. Waiting.</p><p> </p><p>They were carved with the crest of the Harkness kingdom—a serpent wound around a burning branch. Beautiful. Merciless.</p><p> </p><p>She could feel the eyes of the hall pressing against her shoulders. Nobles studying her posture, advisors measuring her expression, guards waiting for her slightest movement, ready to emulate it. Everyone wanting her to be something. Softer, harder, warmer, colder. A symbol, not a woman.</p><p> </p><p>And above them all, the gaze she felt the most — the River’s. Its envoys lined the outer aisles, silver robed, watchful.</p><p> </p><p>Every breath she took here would be noted.</p><p>Every hesitation carried into the archives.</p><p>Every vow judged not just by her people but by the sacred current itself.</p><p> </p><p>Her gloves felt too tight suddenly. She flexed her fingers once, twice. The polished metal of her insignia glinted beneath the candlelight.</p><p> </p><p><em>Just a ceremony.</em> That was what she told herself.</p><p>She had attended a dozen of these political unions in her lifetime — some for peace, others for power. It was nothing more than ritual theatre.</p><p> </p><p>And yet her pulse had been steady only until the moment the first note of the ceremonial organ struck.</p><p> </p><p>The doors creaked open.</p><p> </p><p>The murmurs died, swallowed by silence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio drew a breath and looked up.</p><p> </p><p>The bride entered.</p><p> </p><p>Everything seemed to slow.</p><p> </p><p>At first glance, she looked like a statue — something carved of snow and moonlight, swaying slightly under the weight of its own beauty. The gown was enormous, heavy silk embroidered with so much gold it gleamed like armor. Chains of jewelry hung from her wrists, her neck, her hair.</p><p> </p><p>Each step brought her closer to the fate they were about to share — the one Rio had agreed to, and in doing so, sealed for both of them.</p><p> </p><p>To most, it might have seemed she was gliding forward effortlessly. But Rio’s trained eye caught the truth in every movement. The subtle hesitation in her gait, the way her back held too straight, her breath too shallow.</p><p> </p><p>Every step was measured. Forced. Pained.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Ribbons of silk wound tightly down her arms, binding her wrists together as if she were a prisoner being offered, not a bride being received.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath caught when she looked higher.</p><p> </p><p>The bride’s face was obscured — not by lace or sheer silk.</p><p> </p><p>Chainmail.</p><p> </p><p>Not the heavy kind worn for battle, but a delicate weave of silver, fine as frost, veiling her features in shimmer and silence.</p><p> </p><p>The sound it made — a faint, metallic whisper — cut sharper than anything the officiator had said.</p><p> </p><p><em>They caged her,</em> Rio thought.</p><p> </p><p>A strange twist of feeling clawed its way up from her gut — not disgust, not pity. Anger.</p><p> </p><p>This was meant to be a union. A peace. Yet everything about this girl’s attire screamed possession. Her bowed head. Her bound wrists. The weight of her veil.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched. Her fingers twitched at her side, as though itching to undo the knots themselves.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>Not yet.</p><p> </p><p>The hall’s eyes were still on her, waiting. She had to remain composed, poised, untouchable.</p><p> </p><p>The bride reached the steps.</p><p> </p><p>And then, she knelt.</p><p> </p><p>Not in a sweeping, elegant gesture. Not for show.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped slowly, like her body was made of stone. The veil shimmered as it fell forward, hiding her face completely once more. The cords around her wrists clinked faintly, pulling her shoulders into a hunch.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t lift her head.</p><p> </p><p>But she raised her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Delicate, gloved fingers extended forward, wrists bound together by silk, held in the quiet gesture of a girl trained not to speak — only to offer.</p><p> </p><p>The movement was precise. Practiced. As if she’d rehearsed it in a hundred nightmares.</p><p> </p><p>Her chin stayed low. Her eyes remained hidden. She didn’t look at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She was waiting.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator paused. The hall was watching.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared down at the figure kneeling before her — still, silent, veiled in silver.</p><p> </p><p>And something in her chest cracked.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped forward slowly, the echo of her boots against marble the only sound in the room. Her hands itched at her sides. The gloves felt too tight again. Her lungs struggled to expand.</p><p> </p><p>When she reached the girl, she stopped. The small hands remained lifted, wrists lifted in silent submission.</p><p> </p><p>As if she were an offering.</p><p> </p><p>As if she belonged to her now.</p><p> </p><p>A flicker of heat sparked in Rio’s throat. She didn’t like being watched. She didn’t like being pushed. But more than anything, she didn’t like what this moment was asking her to become.</p><p> </p><p>Her boots echoed as she stepped forward.</p><p> </p><p>Each sound rang louder than it should have — and yet the room said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator’s voice paused, waiting for her to complete the next motion. To take the bride’s hands. To lift the veil. To claim what was apparently hers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached the kneeling figure and stopped.</p><p> </p><p>The girl didn’t look up. She was perfectly still.</p><p> </p><p>The candlelight danced across the curve of her shoulders. The cords at her wrists shimmered like silk shackles. Her head was bowed beneath a veil that glinted like frost.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled — once — and then slowly bent her knees.</p><p> </p><p>She knelt in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Gasps rippled through the room. A murmur rose — low, startled, sharp. Somewhere at the edge of her awareness, someone whispered her title. Someone else cursed.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t hear them.</p><p> </p><p>She was watching the girl.</p><p> </p><p>She had flinched when Rio had knelt down. Her shoulders tensed and her head lifted just slightly as if afraid of what was happening.</p><p> </p><p>They were level now. Two women, face to face.</p><p> </p><p>Separated only by gold mesh.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked through the fine lattice of chainmail, and for a single breathless moment, she wished she could see her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand rose slowly. No flourish. No ceremony. Just movement.</p><p> </p><p>The veil caught slightly on the girl’s ear. Rio adjusted it carefully, lifting it back over her crown and letting it fall like water behind her shoulders.</p><p>And there she was.</p><p> </p><p>Pale, composed, eyes still downcast. But her mouth was set, her jaw firm, breath held like a thread in her throat. Rio recognised that look.</p><p> </p><p>She was not empty.</p><p> </p><p>She was enduring.</p><p> </p><p>The candlelight caught on the jewelry around her neck, turning her into something both regal and ruined.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at her for one second too long.</p><p> </p><p>Then she reached for the cords.</p><p> </p><p>The silk was soft beneath her gloves, smooth as river reeds. She worked through the knots slowly, gently — not the way she’d been taught, not the way the ritual called for.</p><p> </p><p>The first knot loosened with a soft pull.</p><p> </p><p>The girl’s hands twitched in surprise.</p><p> </p><p>The second knot gave way with a breath.</p><p> </p><p>The final tie fell apart between her fingers, and the cords slid free.</p><p> </p><p>Her wrists were bare.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t lower her hands yet. She stayed still, gaze still lowered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hovered for a moment, gloved fingers lingering just above hers. The air between them felt warmer now. Heavier.</p><p> </p><p>There was something there.</p><p> </p><p>A quiet pressure, warm and unfamiliar, rising in the breath of space between their hands.</p><p> </p><p>She looked up, briefly meeting the officiator’s eye.</p><p> </p><p>He inclined his head.</p><p> </p><p>“You may rise.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio offered her hand.</p><p> </p><p>The girl glanced at it — then at her. Their eyes met for the first time.</p><p> </p><p>Ocean blue. Too many stories written behind them.</p><p> </p><p>She hesitated, then placed her hand in Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>And together, they stood.</p><p> </p><p>——-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lowered herself to her knees as she had been taught.</p><p> </p><p>She had practiced the motion dozens of times under her mother’s watchful eye — the art of lowering without tripping on her skirts, of keeping her spine straight even as her pride bent.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her head bowed — hands offered, posture still.</p><p> </p><p>Not out of devotion.</p><p>Not even submission.</p><p> </p><p>Shame.</p><p> </p><p>The shame of being reduced to this.</p><p>Of being expected to make herself small.</p><p> </p><p>But even here, even like this, she refused to let her spine bend too far. She could kneel. She would kneel. But she would not break.</p><p> </p><p>She waited for the expected motions—the claiming hand, the lifting of the veil, the sharp tug of silk cords undone by someone standing over her.</p><p> </p><p>But none of it came. The silence in the hall stretched.</p><p> </p><p>And then—</p><p> </p><p>A shadow lowered beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the presence before she understood it: solid, deliberate, grounding the space rather than dominating it.</p><p> </p><p>The queen had knelt.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath caught, sharp behind her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>Through the chainmail veil, the shape beside her blurred and shifted, kneeling to her level. Not claiming height. Not claiming ownership.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what to do with that.</p><p>Kindness, in her experience, was never given freely. It always hid a hook. A price. A lesson.</p><p> </p><p>She braced herself for the catch.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, gloved hands lifted her veil with slow, careful precision. As though afraid to disturb her.</p><p> </p><p>The chainmail shifted. Light rippled across her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Light rippled across her face as the world came back into focus.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha still didn’t look up.</p><p>She didn’t trust herself to.</p><p>Better to expect contempt than be caught off guard by something unfamiliar.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze stayed fixed on the queen’s hands as they reached for the silk cords binding her wrists. Each knot was untied with measured patience, the movement steady enough that Agatha felt a strange flutter of unease.</p><p> </p><p>Gentleness always unsettled her more than cruelty.</p><p>She knew how to defend herself against harshness — she had practice.</p><p>Softness, though… softness unmade her.</p><p> </p><p>The gloves brushed her skin only lightly, dulled by fabric, but warmth seeped through despite the barrier. A faint tingle crawled up her arms. Not magic. Not anything she could name.</p><p> </p><p>Something else.</p><p> </p><p>By the time the cords fell away and her wrists were freed, Agatha felt both lighter and heavier — loosened physically, tightened somewhere deeper.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t expected this.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t expected her captor queen to kneel.</p><p>She hadn’t expected gentleness.</p><p>She hadn’t expected to feel anything at all.</p><p> </p><p>The queen rose first, then extended a hand down toward her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p> </p><p>Not in fear.</p><p>Not in defiance.</p><p> </p><p>In calculation.</p><p> </p><p>Everything in her wanted to refuse the hand – wanted to stand on her own, to show she wasn’t as breakable as the world kept insisting she was. That she still had dignity left.</p><p> </p><p>But refusing would draw her mother’s ire. Would insult the queen. Would risk everything before it even began.</p><p> </p><p>So she lifted her chin—just barely—and looked at the offered hand.</p><p>A compromise with herself.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally raised her gaze higher, cautious and searching, her eyes met the queen’s for the first time.</p><p> </p><p>Dark. Steady.</p><p>Not cruel.</p><p>Not cold.</p><p> </p><p>But not soft either.</p><p>Something more complicated lived there — something unreadable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened.</p><p>She ignored it.</p><p>She took the hand.</p><p> </p><p>The contact was fleeting, dulled by glove and courtesy, but it sparked something low and unwelcome in her chest — a quiet pressure, a whisper without words.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t trust it.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t trust her reaction to it.</p><p> </p><p>And she didn’t have time to make sense of it anyway. The officiator turned, voice rising, calling them forward for the next phase.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood beside the queen, hands folded neatly now, wrists bare and suddenly cold. With the veil gone, nothing blurred her vision — and yet somehow she saw less clearly than before.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced up once more, quick, assessing, guarded.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t what she’d been told to expect.</p><p>This wasn’t a tyrant.</p><p>This wasn’t a monster.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha had learned young: even gentle hands could turn cruel.</p><p> </p><p>So she said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>She listened, she watched, and she waited.</p><p> </p><p>Not broken.</p><p>Not trusting.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p> </p><p>——-</p><p> </p><p>The officiator’s voice echoed across the stone hall.</p><p> </p><p>“Join hands before the River. Let your union be bound, and your fate entwined.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward first.</p><p> </p><p>She stood before the ceremonial basin — silver and still, filled with water drawn from the northern tributary of the River of Life. A single flower floated at its center, undisturbed. Tradition. Symbol. Ritual.</p><p> </p><p>She heard the girl move behind her.</p><p>Not timid, not faltering — just quiet.</p><p> </p><p>When she reached Rio’s side, the officiator extended the silk cords — the same ones that had bound the girl’s wrists only moments ago.</p><p> </p><p>Now, they would be used to join them.</p><p> </p><p>The symbolism of it wasn’t lost on Rio.</p><p>She just didn’t have the time or clarity to think about what it meant.</p><p> </p><p>“Bare hands,” the officiator said.</p><p> </p><p>She hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>Her right hand hovered at her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>Then, without ceremony, she slipped the glove off.</p><p> </p><p>The leather fell away with a soft hiss. The air kissed her skin — cool, clean. She hadn’t touched another person barehanded in weeks. Maybe longer.</p><p> </p><p>She extended her hand toward the girl —</p><p> </p><p>Agatha — the name burned itself into her mind without being spoken.</p><p> </p><p>And she raised hers in turn.</p><p> </p><p>Their palms met.</p><p> </p><p>Skin to skin.</p><p> </p><p>The world split.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s legs almost buckled. She gripped tighter — reflex, instinct — as a surge of something <em>massive</em> shot through her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Not heat. Not pain. Not magic.</p><p>Something deeper. Older.</p><p> </p><p><em>This could not be what she feared it was.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped softly, eyes flickering to her like she’d felt it too.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grip tightened reflexively, steadying her. She didn’t speak, didn’t move, didn’t dare breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Her ears filled with the rush of riverwater — but it wasn’t sound. It was sensation. Movement inside her. Pressure behind her ribs. Light behind her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>For one disorienting moment, she wasn’t standing in a ceremonial hall.</p><p> </p><p>She was standing in a current.</p><p>Dragged under by something inevitable.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes met again.</p><p> </p><p>The pull between them burned like truth.</p><p> </p><p>Like fate.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator was still speaking — reciting the vows, invoking the River — but Rio barely heard him.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand was small, but steady.</p><p>The cords were being wrapped now — looped around their joined wrists, one, then the other.</p><p> </p><p>And still, the sensation didn’t fade.</p><p> </p><p>The mark had bloomed beneath her skin — she could <em>feel</em> it. Not visible to the crowd, but present. Seared into her chest like a second heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t supposed to happen.</p><p>This could not happen.</p><p>Not here.</p><p>Not now.</p><p> </p><p>She fought to keep her expression still.</p><p>To keep her breathing even.</p><p> </p><p>She tried to maintain a facade of indifference.</p><p>But something inside her had already shifted beyond repair.</p><p> </p><p>——-</p><p> </p><p>The water shimmered beneath their joined hands.</p><p> </p><p>At first, Agatha thought it was just the light. The reflection of the silver bowl, perhaps, or the flicker of candles against metal. But then it moved — not across the surface, but through her.</p><p> </p><p>A sound — not sound at all, more like a breath drawn through the soul — passed between them. Her fingers tightened instinctively around the other woman’s, though she didn’t know why.</p><p> </p><p>The world narrowed.</p><p> </p><p>Her heart stuttered once, twice, and then found a rhythm that wasn’t hers.</p><p> </p><p>As though it now beat with someone else’s.</p><p> </p><p>She inhaled sharply. The scent of river salt and candle smoke filled her lungs, dizzying. It was as though the air itself had changed — thicker, sweeter, alive.</p><p> </p><p>Then came the heat.</p><p> </p><p>It started beneath her sternum — a sudden, sharp pulse that spread outward in a single sweep, radiating through every nerve. She barely swallowed a gasp. Her knees weakened.</p><p> </p><p><em>No,</em> she thought. <em>No, no, no.</em></p><p> </p><p>This couldn’t be what she thought it was.</p><p> </p><p>And yet… it was.</p><p> </p><p>The mark.</p><p> </p><p>The stories always spoke of it — the way your soul would <em>know.</em> That when you touched the one the River had chosen, you’d feel the current carve its name into your heart.</p><p> </p><p>She felt it now, burning invisible and undeniable beneath her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze lifted, dazed, to the woman standing before her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>The foreign queen. The stranger she was meant to now call wife.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught on a quiet, disbelieving laugh that never reached her lips. For years she had convinced herself she didn’t believe in this—didn’t <em>need</em> it. And still, in the dark hours, some fragile part of her had imagined what it might feel like. What it might mean.</p><p> </p><p>She’d never thought it would feel like this.</p><p> </p><p>Like drowning.</p><p> </p><p>Like being handed a miracle and a curse in the same breath.</p><p> </p><p>She searched the other woman’s face for any sign of recognition — the faintest flicker that she felt it too.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing.</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s expression didn’t shift. Her jaw was set, her eyes unreadable, her shoulders squared in calm defiance. If she felt the same lightning that was burning through Agatha’s veins, she hid it behind a wall of stone.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator’s voice thundered the final words of the vow. The crowd applauded.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely heard it.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand slipped from her now wife’s as the applause swelled. The absence of contact was like stepping out of sunlight into cold air. A hollow space where something had been forming only moments ago.</p><p> </p><p>She curled her fingers into a fist, letting her nails bite half-moons into her palm. It grounded her. Brought back the clarity she needed.</p><p> </p><p>So that was her answer.</p><p> </p><p>Not rejection — not quite — but distance. Deliberate. Controlled.</p><p>A queen refusing to acknowledge whatever had flickered between them.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha understood why.</p><p>Of course she did.</p><p> </p><p>A soulmate bond between queens was dangerous enough.</p><p>A soulmate bond to <em>her</em> — an unseen Spirit witch from a kingdom the court already distrusted — would look like corruption. Influence. A threat to the throne.</p><p> </p><p>She knew exactly how their story would be spun.</p><p> </p><p><em>The foreign girl bewitched her.</em></p><p><em>The Spirit witch ensnared our queen.</em></p><p><em>Her magic tainted the River’s chosen heir.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha would be the villain before she ever had the chance to speak.</p><p>She always was.</p><p> </p><p>So the coolness in the queen’s eyes wasn’t cruelty.</p><p>It was strategy.</p><p>Survival.</p><p>And Agatha couldn’t fault her for that.</p><p> </p><p>But the faint ache beneath her ribs remained — a small, sharp thing she refused to name.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t matter. It couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever spark had flared the moment their hands touched would have to stay buried. Hidden so deeply no Tidekeeper, no advisor, no rival kingdom could detect it.</p><p> </p><p>The bond, if that’s what it was, wasn’t a gift.</p><p>It was a liability.</p><p>A threat.</p><p>A chain with two ends — and one of those ends wrapped around <em>her</em> neck far more tightly.</p><p> </p><p>Besides, she’d spent her whole life being something to endure, to hide, to barter. She didn’t need to be chained to someone else by law <em>and</em> by soul.</p><p> </p><p>Her throat ached with the effort of holding herself upright beneath the weight of the dress, the jewelry, the crowd’s gaze.</p><p> </p><p>The cords were gone, but her wrists still burned where  the queen’s fingers had touched them.</p><p> </p><p>And though she told herself she didn’t care, the mark beneath her heart throbbed once more, like it was laughing at her.</p><p> </p><p>Before them stood the basin — the same basin they had joined their hands over while the fate of their lives were forever changed.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator turned toward them, his voice lower now, as though even ceremony bowed before the water.</p><p> </p><p>“By the current that carves all fates,” he intoned, “do you enter into this union willingly?”</p><p> </p><p>The question hung in the air like smoke.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth went dry.</p><p> </p><p>Willingly.</p><p> </p><p>The word struck harder than she expected.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze wavered. Instinct told her not to look anywhere but forward, but the silence stretched too long. Against her better judgment, she glanced toward the crowd.</p><p> </p><p>Rows of faces stared back — unreadable, gilded, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>And there, near the front, was her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Her expression was a blade. Eyes sharp. Jaw tight. A single small movement of her chin — a warning.</p><p> </p><p>Don’t you dare.</p><p> </p><p>Don’t embarrass us.</p><p> </p><p>Don’t make this harder than it already is.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. Her throat ached. The room was too warm, the veil of incense too thick. The officiator’s expectant pause pressed against her ribs like a hand.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes drifted back — unwillingly — to the woman in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>The queen was still watching her.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes met briefly. Just a flicker.</p><p>There was no command in it. No impatience.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze was still unreadable but something flickered through it. Something that almost resembled guilt.</p><p> </p><p>Then the gaze dropped, and the moment passed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, the word scraping its way out of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“I do.”</p><p> </p><p>It came out soft — almost fragile — but it was enough.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator turned toward the queen.</p><p> </p><p>“And do you, Rio Vidal, enter into this union willingly?”</p><p> </p><p>There was a beat of silence.</p><p> </p><p>Then, clear but Agatha caught almost a hint of hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>“I do.”</p><p> </p><p>The officiator nodded once. “Then let the River be your witness.”</p><p> </p><p>He gestured to the basin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated only a heartbeat before extending her hand. The queen did the same. Their palms met once more — bare this time. No gloves. No cords. Only skin and skin.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator guided their hands together, then lowered them both into the basin.</p><p> </p><p>The water was cold. Not sharp, but chilling enough to steal her breath. Her fingers curled slightly against the queen’s, instinctively, reflexively.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator began the vows.</p><p> </p><p>He spoke slowly, with weight. “Repeat after me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her breath.</p><p> </p><p>“I, Agatha of House Harkness vow to serve this union,” he said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha echoed, softly, “I, Agatha of House Harkness vow to serve this union.”</p><p> </p><p>“I vow to obey the laws that bind us.”</p><p> </p><p>The words scraped like glass on her tongue. “I vow to obey the laws that bind us.”</p><p> </p><p>“I vow to honour my duty, even when the current turns.”</p><p> </p><p>She forced the words out. “I vow to honour my duty, even when the current turns.”</p><p> </p><p>“Until the River runs dry.”</p><p> </p><p>She hesitated — just barely — then whispered, “Until the River runs dry.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>Then the officiator turned to the queen.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice, when it came, was steady.</p><p>Stronger. Sharper. But no warmer.</p><p> </p><p>“I, Queen Rio Vidal, vow to lead this union.”</p><p> </p><p>“I vow to uphold the laws that bind us.”</p><p> </p><p>“I vow to protect my duty, even when the current turns.”</p><p> </p><p>“Until the River runs dry.”</p><p> </p><p>Each line was delivered with perfect clarity, but something shifted in her voice on that last phrase. A tightness, barely there. As if it cost her something.</p><p> </p><p>Their hands remained in the basin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought the water would do something — shimmer, hiss, swirl. But it only trembled once, like a held breath, and stilled.</p><p> </p><p>No thunder. No blessing. No voice of the gods.</p><p> </p><p>Only the cold.</p><p> </p><p>And the way her hand began to ache the longer she held it in the queen’s.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator nodded. “The River has heard you.”</p><p> </p><p>He stepped forward with the rings — simple bands of river forged metal. Silver for Agatha. Iron dark for the queen.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you accept this bond?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>Neither of them spoke.</p><p> </p><p>But their hands released, and they each took the other’s ring.</p><p> </p><p>The metal was warm — warmer than it should have been. It slid onto her finger like it already knew where to go.</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s touch was brief.</p><p> </p><p>A brush. A weight.</p><p> </p><p>Then it was done.</p><p> </p><p>There was a beat of silence.</p><p> </p><p>The applause swelled, formal and hollow. Somewhere behind it, the officiator’s voice rang out one final time, clear and ceremonial.</p><p> </p><p>“By the will of the River and the bond that now binds you—</p><p> </p><p>You may seal your union with a kiss.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went still.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath hitched. She didn’t look up.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know what would be worse. To be kissed like a stranger… or not kissed at all.</p><p> </p><p>The silence that followed felt too long.</p><p> </p><p>Then came a shift beside her.</p><p> </p><p>She felt the queen turn, not toward the crowd, but toward her. Agatha looked up, just in time to meet her gaze.</p><p> </p><p>There was no cruelty in it. No coldness.</p><p> </p><p>But there was something else — something measured and unreadable.</p><p> </p><p>She braced herself.</p><p> </p><p>But the queen didn’t lean in.</p><p>Didn’t reach for her waist.</p><p>Didn’t touch her face.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she extended a hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, unsure, let her take it.</p><p> </p><p>The queen lifted it gently and pressed her lips to the back of it.</p><p> </p><p>Soft. Measured. Brief.</p><p> </p><p>A gesture not of possession. Not of passion.</p><p> </p><p>But of something stranger.</p><p> </p><p>Something that almost felt like respect.</p><p> </p><p>A flicker of heat curled up Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>Not from the touch.</p><p> </p><p>From the unfamiliar ache that followed it.</p><p> </p><p>The queen straightened again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>But something in her had shifted.</p><p> </p><p>She had braced for coldness. For cruelty. For indifference wearing a crown.</p><p> </p><p>And instead, she got that.</p><p> </p><p>A type of kiss that was not expected by duty but felt more powerful all the same.</p><p> </p><p>It meant nothing.</p><p> </p><p>And yet it felt like it meant everything.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know what to make of it.</p><p> </p><p>Didn’t know what to make of <em>her.</em></p><p> </p><p>No cheers followed. Only silence — brittle and uncertain.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere near the front, a whisper cut through the stillness like a knife.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look toward it. She kept her eyes forward, her face composed.</p><p> </p><p>But her pulse thundered in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Because she didn’t know if what had just happened was an act of mercy—</p><p> </p><p>Or a rejection.</p><p> </p><p>——-</p><p> </p><p>The question had been simple.</p><p> </p><p><em>Do you enter into this union willingly?</em></p><p> </p><p>The words still rang in her skull.</p><p> </p><p>She’d known the answer before Agatha spoke it. She’d felt it in the silence that followed, in the way the girl’s shoulders had locked beneath the weight of her mother’s stare. That was not the pause of a bride gathering her breath. It was the pause of someone cornered.</p><p> </p><p>And when the answer finally came—soft, obedient, wrong—it scraped against something raw inside Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Her own “I do” had tasted like iron.</p><p> </p><p>She’d said it anyway. For duty. For the River. For peace.</p><p> </p><p>But as the officiator spoke the vows, the words curdled in her mouth. <em>To lead. To command. To take what is offered and make it mine.</em> They were relics from a time when victory was measured in possession. When unions were spoils.</p><p> </p><p>She repeated them because her position demanded it. Because hesitation would be read as weakness.</p><p>And still, she felt sick.</p><p> </p><p>The basin’s water had been cold, but when their hands touched, heat had pulsed up her arm—alive, startling, wrong. She’d kept her expression blank while the current twisted through her chest.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t stop.</p><p> </p><p>Even now, standing before the crowd, her pulse thrummed unevenly. Something foreign had lodged itself beneath her ribs, moving with each beat.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to name it.</p><p> </p><p>Couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>When the officiator offered the rings, she slid the silver one onto Agatha’s finger carefully, avoiding the tremor in her own hand. The gesture should have been meaningless, mechanical. It wasn’t. The sight of metal against pale skin looked final, binding in a way that no treaty had ever been.</p><p> </p><p>Then the officiator uttered the last words—<em>You may seal your union with a kiss</em>—and she felt the entire hall tilt toward her.</p><p> </p><p>Expectation.</p><p> </p><p>She could feel it pressing against her spine, the crowd hungry for spectacle, for proof of dominance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>For a heartbeat, neither did Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She could have ended it cleanly— a formal kiss, brief and cold, the sort that satisfied ceremony. But her stomach turned at the thought of forcing it.</p><p> </p><p>So she’d done the only thing that felt bearable. She’d taken Agatha’s hand, kissed the back of it, and hoped the crowd would see restraint as strength.</p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t. The air curdled with whispers the instant she straightened.</p><p> </p><p>Let them talk.</p><p> </p><p>She’d endured worse.</p><p> </p><p>But when she looked at Agatha—really looked—something twisted in her again. The girl wasn’t trembling anymore. She stood tall beside her, face unreadable, eyes bright with something Rio couldn’t name. Not defiance. Not fear.</p><p> </p><p>Something closer to understanding.</p><p> </p><p>Or danger.</p><p> </p><p>The pulse beneath her ribs surged once more, hard enough to steal her breath.</p><p> </p><p>It couldn’t be.</p><p> </p><p>She’d read enough of the old texts to know what it meant—the pull, the warmth, the flicker that had burned through the water. A bond. A mark. A claiming of souls.</p><p> </p><p>Impossible.</p><p> </p><p>Unthinkable.</p><p> </p><p>Unwelcome.</p><p> </p><p>This was supposed to be political. Contained. Manageable.</p><p> </p><p>Now it was none of those things.</p><p> </p><p>Her heart knew it, even if she refused to. The River had tied her to someone she could not afford to want.</p><p> </p><p>She imagined what would happen if anyone discovered it. The Council. The courts. The Order. A queen bound not only by law but by <em>soul</em> to another witch — an Unseen, no less.</p><p> </p><p>They would not call it sacred. They would call it corruption.</p><p> </p><p>They would say her magic had been compromised, her will entangled, her throne no longer her own.</p><p> </p><p>The River’s favor would be questioned. The balance between Seen and Unseen — already fragile — would fracture.</p><p> </p><p>The council would circle like vultures, her enemies whispering that <em>Lady Death had been claimed.</em></p><p> </p><p>And once the court began to believe she could be claimed, they would believe she could be <em>replaced.</em></p><p> </p><p>It would end her.</p><p>It would end <em>them.</em></p><p> </p><p>She forced her jaw to still.</p><p> </p><p>The hall had begun to empty, courtiers whispering, attendants following in a ripple of fabric and perfume. Agatha moved beside her, the rustle of her gown soft against the stone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look at her again. She couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>She stood until the last echo of footsteps faded, the cold basin water drying on her skin, the mark beneath it burning like a brand.</p><p> </p><p>She straightened her shoulders, the mask of composure sliding back into place.</p><p> </p><p><em>This was a treaty,</em> she told herself. <em>A union. A necessity.</em></p><p> </p><p>Nothing more.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, as she turned to leave the altar, the phantom warmth of Agatha’s hand lingered against her palm, refusing to fade.</p><p> </p><p>——-</p><p> </p><p>The celebrations had been moved to the grand dining hall. Where rows of tables lined the floor piled high with food and wines. A great waste if you asked Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>The silence and vows were traded for food and laughter — or something that resembled laughter. The sound of silverware and strained pleasantries filled the great dining chamber, its vaulted ceilings glittering with banners from both kingdoms.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat beside her new wife at the head of the table.</p><p> </p><p>A golden crown weighed against her temples. The scent of roasted meats and river herbs clung thick in the air, yet she found herself unable to eat. Her stomach hadn’t quite forgiven her for the morning.</p><p> </p><p>To her left, the queen sat in perfect silence.</p><p> </p><p>Her posture was immaculate — straight-backed, composed, as though carved from the same stone as the throne itself. The candlelight slid across her armour trimmed coat and the curve of her jaw, catching on the dark braid that fell against one shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>It was long — longer than Agatha had seen anyone in her kingdom keep their hair before. It would probably reach her hip bone if unbraided. The braid itself was intricate, almost ceremonial in pattern, threaded through with fine silver cords that caught the light each time she moved.</p><p> </p><p>In Agathas kingdom braids were a private thing. Or something only common ladies wore openly. A woman unbraided her hair only in solitude — before bathing, before sleep, or before surrender. To wear it so openly was considered intimate. Improper, even.</p><p> </p><p>And yet on her, it didn’t look improper at all.</p><p> </p><p>It looked deliberate. Regal. Powerful.</p><p> </p><p>The contrast unsettled Agatha more than she wanted to admit. There was something striking about the way the braid framed her face — too soft for a warlady, too human for the legends that followed her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tore her gaze away before the queen could notice.</p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t spoken a word to each other.</p><p> </p><p>That that it bothered Agatha. It didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>She traced the edge of her goblet with her thumb, watching the ripples shiver across the wine. Around them, courtiers from both realms conversed politely, glancing toward the head table now and then to gauge how well peace had taken root.</p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Not yet, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally glanced toward her mother, she found her watching — eyes sharp, lips pressed in that familiar warning curve. A pointed flick of her gaze toward the queen. Then back to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p><em>Speak.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled silently, schooling her face. Forced conversation in front of half a court — the very thing she detested. But disobedience would bring questions she couldn’t afford.</p><p> </p><p>She angled slightly toward the queen, catching the profile carved in candlelight — calm, composed, unknowable.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” she began, steadying her voice, “is it true that the rivers in your kingdom glow blue at night?”</p><p> </p><p>The queen blinked, as though pulled back from somewhere deep. “Only near the northern cliffs.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice held a low, smooth certainty. A sound that made Agatha’s pulse flicker against her will.</p><p> </p><p>“Minerals?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>A brief pause. “No. The spirits,” the queen corrected softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded — but not blindly. “Do the Order say that,” she murmured, “or do <em>you</em> believe it?”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s gaze slid toward her, a flicker of surprise breaking through the mask. “Both,” she said slowly. “The cliffs are a sacred burial ground. The stories may exaggerate, but they have roots.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, turning her goblet. “Stories always do.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s expression changed — tiny, but there. Not quite approval. More like recognition.</p><p> </p><p>Encouraged, Agatha added, “And the myth about your soldiers? The blindfold training?”</p><p> </p><p>That earned a sharper reaction — the queen’s eyes cutting toward her, startled, amused for half a heartbeat before she quelled it.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said. “Pure invention.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha allowed a faint smile. “Pity. My mother speaks of it like scripture.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen exhaled — almost a laugh, almost disbelief. “It would be inefficient. And deadly.”</p><p> </p><p>“So the truth is less… dramatic?” Agatha asked lightly.</p><p> </p><p>The queen considered that. “The truth is quieter,” she answered. “Which is why it’s easier to miss.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha met her gaze — brief, assessing. “Or easier to twist,” she said, echoing the subtle edge in the queen’s voice.</p><p> </p><p>That surprised the queen again. A small tilt of her head. A softening at the edges, quickly concealed.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother’s approving nod from across the table made her want to throw a knife at her.</p><p> </p><p>After that, the conversation dissolved.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s food went cold. She caught herself glancing at the queen more than once — not because she meant to, but because she couldn’t seem to help it. There was something unreadable about her.</p><p> </p><p>She’d expected cruelty. Arrogance. Control.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she found quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Too quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Each time she thought of something to say, the words dried up on her tongue. The queen’s expression gave nothing back, and yet… Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that beneath all that stillness, there was movement.</p><p> </p><p>Something restless.</p><p> </p><p>Something alive.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, she gave up trying. She sat back in her chair, lifting her wine in mock celebration as the courtiers’ laughter swelled around them.</p><p> </p><p><em>Let her be silent,</em> she told herself. <em>It’s not as if I care.</em></p><p> </p><p>And yet, when the music began to rise from the far end of the hall — soft, distant, carrying the first notes of what would soon become their dance — Agatha found herself stealing one last glance.</p><p> </p><p>The queen hadn’t moved.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand hovered over her goblet, untouched. Her eyes were on the far wall, but her mind was somewhere far beyond it.</p><p> </p><p>For someone who ruled with such control, she looked utterly lost.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha couldn’t decide if that made her feel sorry for her. Or just more intrigued.</p><p> </p><p>———</p><p> </p><p>From the outside, she knew she looked composed.</p><p>The perfect picture of control — head high, hands still, posture unyielding.</p><p> </p><p>But inside, everything was unraveling.</p><p> </p><p>Every breath, every heartbeat, every accidental brush of Agatha’s sleeve was a reminder of the bond — of that quiet, burning pulse beneath her skin that refused to fade. She could feel it humming between them, faint but constant, like an invisible thread tugging whenever Agatha shifted in her chair.</p><p> </p><p>It was unbearable.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her eyes fixed ahead, because if she looked at her wife — at the woman she was not supposed to want, not supposed to feel <em>anything</em> for — she was certain the entire hall would see it written across her face.</p><p> </p><p>The council. The nobles. The River Order.</p><p>They couldn’t find out.</p><p> </p><p>Not now. Not ever.</p><p> </p><p>She was already calculating contingencies — how to contain this, how to make it <em>manageable.</em> Layers of routine. Distance. Control. If she kept everything tightly ordered, perhaps the bond would fade into the background, forgotten beneath the rhythm of governance and duty.</p><p> </p><p>And she’d have to protect Agatha — not because she <em>wanted</em> to, but because it was the right thing to do. The girl hadn’t chosen any of this. She shouldn’t have to pay for Rio’s mistakes or for the River’s cruelty.</p><p> </p><p>The court would already be watching her for weakness. If they sensed anything unusual — if they even <em>suspected</em> something sacred had passed between them — the rumors would spread like wildfire.</p><p> </p><p>A queen bound to another witch was not a symbol of unity.</p><p> </p><p>It was a threat. A weapon.</p><p> </p><p>And in the end, that weapon would be turned on the one least able to survive it.</p><p> </p><p>So she sat still.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t trust herself to speak — not without giving something away. Her silence wasn’t disinterest, it was survival. Every word felt like stepping into open flame.</p><p> </p><p>Still, when Agatha spoke — hesitant, yes, but curious, perceptive, reaching toward her in a way Rio hadn’t expected — Rio had to fight the absurd urge to actually answer her. To let the stiffness drop for a moment. To smile. To try.</p><p> </p><p>It was ridiculous, truly.</p><p>The great Queen Vidal, breaker of sieges, terror of half the realm, undone by a girl asking questions at a dinner table.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha’s questions weren’t foolish.</p><p>They weren’t vapid court pleasantries.</p><p>They were clever, probing in the gentlest way, hinting at a mind far sharper than her gilded dress suggested.</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt something shift inside her.</p><p>Interest she could not afford.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her expression composed, cool, distant. She forced herself to sit as the queen they expected — the one who revealed nothing, who felt nothing, who could not be read.</p><p> </p><p>But as the musicians lifted their instruments at the far end of the hall, their chords swelling into the air like a tide, Rio realized something unsettling.</p><p> </p><p>Her pulse was still tangled with Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Steady.</p><p>Relentless.</p><p>And entirely impossible to ignore</p><p> </p><p>——-</p><p> </p><p>They had moved to the ballroom — though to Rio, it felt less like a celebration and more like an inspection.</p><p> </p><p>Light poured through the crystal sconces, scattering against the mirrored walls until the room shimmered like water. A full orchestra waited near the dais, bows poised, the first notes trembling in the air but not yet released.</p><p> </p><p>The courtiers had already begun to circle, eager for spectacle.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood near the head of the room, spine straight, jaw set. The weight of her crown felt heavier than it had during the ceremony.</p><p> </p><p>She knew what came next.</p><p>Every royal wedding ended the same way — with a first dance to mark unity before the court.</p><p> </p><p>She could already hear Lilia’s voice in her head. <em>You cannot refuse. To do so would insult the treaty, and worse — her.</em></p><p> </p><p>Still, she found herself inching toward the nearest exit as attendants bustled past with trays of wine. If she moved carefully, perhaps no one would notice—</p><p> </p><p>“Your Majesty.”</p><p> </p><p>She froze. It was Lord Cyril, one of her senior advisors — sharp-eyed, the kind who noticed everything. He gave a slight bow, then murmured low enough for only her to hear.</p><p> </p><p>“The court expects the dance. And a reminder Your Majesty, that tonight particularly the envoys of the River Order are watching. We would hate to stir any problems with the High Mother.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked toward the far side of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Sure enough, the silver robed envoys stood in quiet formation near the marble pillars, their expressions unreadable, their attention fixed squarely on her. Their presence coiled around her like a net.</p><p> </p><p>Of course they were here.</p><p>Of course they would report everything — her poise, her restraint, the way she looked at her bride.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard. Refusal wasn’t an option.</p><p> </p><p>The master of ceremonies stepped forward and raised his voice, echoing through the hall.</p><p> </p><p>“Honored guests, it is tradition that the union of the Vidal and the Harkness line be sealed not only by vow, but by grace.</p><p>Her Majesty, Queen Rio Vidal of the Riverlands, and Her Grace, Lady Agatha Vidal, will now open the first dance.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Lady Agatha Vidal.</em></p><p> </p><p>The title hit her harder than she expected — strange, final, tethered to a future she hadn’t meant to claim.</p><p> </p><p>She drew a breath that barely filled her lungs, then stepped forward.</p><p> </p><p>The crowd parted like a tide.</p><p> </p><p>Across the polished floor, Agatha stood waiting — still and uncertain, hands clasped lightly before her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio bowed slightly — a gesture of formality, nothing more — and extended her gloved hand.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Agatha didn’t move. Then she placed her fingers lightly in Rio’s palm.</p><p> </p><p>The orchestra struck its first note.</p><p> </p><p>——-</p><p> </p><p>The music rose, slow and swelling, like a tide filling the room.</p><p> </p><p>For a heartbeat, neither of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel the weight of every gaze in the hall pressing against her — nobles, courtiers, envoys — all waiting to see what kind of union this would be. But her attention caught instead on the woman standing across from her.</p><p> </p><p>The queen. Her now wife.</p><p> </p><p>The dark eyed woman extended a hand — smooth, controlled, palm upturned beneath those black leather gloves. A barrier, intentional or not. A choice. Agatha’s mouth twitched, a smile she didn’t let fully form.</p><p> </p><p>So she didn’t wish to touch her skin.</p><p>Well. The feeling was mutual.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps the queen should have reconsidered before paying a hundred times a traditional dowry for her.</p><p> </p><p>The hesitation before she had extended her hand hadn’t escaped Agatha’s notice. Nor had the taut line of her jaw when their names were spoken together. For one raw, absurd instant, Agatha had thought she might actually turn and leave.</p><p> </p><p>The pang that shot through her chest was small, sharp, humiliatingly quick. She smoothed her expression before it had a chance to surface.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t matter.</p><p>She was used to distance.</p><p>Used to people recoiling before they even knew her.</p><p> </p><p>She placed her hand in the queen’s.</p><p> </p><p>The touch was brief, gloved, formal — and yet something under the surface warmed unpleasantly, as if answering some unseen shift in the air.</p><p> </p><p>They moved.</p><p> </p><p>The first sweep of the dance was measured, textbook, palms joined as they circled each other beneath the blaze of chandeliers. The polished floor gleamed like water catching moonlight. Her body moved on instinct — posture perfect, steps exact, the result of years pressed into her bones by tutors who demanded flawlessness.</p><p> </p><p>Control.</p><p>That she could do.</p><p>That she could survive.</p><p> </p><p>Her chest tightened, breath thinning despite her composure. She disguised it well — timing each inhale with the music — but the edges of her vision wavered, just slightly.</p><p> </p><p>Focus.</p><p>Left foot. Turn. Step.</p><p> </p><p>When she risked a glance upward, she found the queen’s eyes on her.</p><p> </p><p>Not distracted.</p><p>Not polite.</p><p>Focused. Keen.</p><p> </p><p>Noticing.</p><p> </p><p>No one had ever noticed before.</p><p> </p><p>Surely she hadn’t. Surely it was coincidence, just the queen maintaining her focus—</p><p> </p><p>But those eyes didn’t waver.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered and then she released the breath all at once, too quickly.</p><p> </p><p>To cover the moment, she forced a smile — small, crooked, dangerous — and leaned in slightly, her voice just audible over the music.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re awfully tense, Your Majesty,” she murmured. “Surely I’m not that frightening.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s grip faltered — a barely-there slip of control, but Agatha felt it.</p><p> </p><p>Encouraged, Agatha’s smirk deepened. “Don’t worry,” she added softly, “I promise not to step on your toes. Much.”</p><p> </p><p>A flicker — something that almost looked like surprise — crossed the queen’s face. Then, unbelievably, a glint of amusement.</p><p> </p><p>“See?” Agatha went on, stepping into the next turn with unexpected grace. “Not so bad, is it? All that fuss for nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s expression shifted — the briefest tug at her mouth, gone almost before Agatha could be sure she’d seen it.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, for that single breath between beats, the tension in the room changed.</p><p>It wasn’t the bond exactly — though she could feel it, thrumming beneath her skin, answering the rhythm of the music. It was something simpler. Stranger.</p><p> </p><p>The sense that, despite the formality, despite the distance, they were suddenly <em>seeing</em> each other.</p><p> </p><p>——</p><p> </p><p>It should have been easy.</p><p>A series of practiced steps. A public performance.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Rio couldn’t remember when her last clean breath had been.</p><p> </p><p>The room blurred around the edges, gilded faces blending with candlelight. All she could focus on was the woman before her — the deliberate way she moved, the precision of her form, the quiet defiance tucked between every graceful motion.</p><p> </p><p>She’d expected fragility. What she found was force.</p><p> </p><p>When their hands met, the warmth that sparked through her gloves startled her. The bond again — that low, insistent pulse that refused to fade. She could almost feel it beneath the music, as if the River itself were keeping time between their steps.</p><p> </p><p>She’d nearly refused the dance. She still wanted to. Every nerve in her body screamed retreat. But the envoys of the River Order were watching, their silver robes gleaming in her periphery, and she couldn’t give them more reason to whisper.</p><p> </p><p>So she held her posture, moved as the court expected — and tried not to think about how close they were.</p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha looked up.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p> </p><p>For an instant, Rio’s rhythm broke — just slightly — because she saw something she hadn’t expected. Not fear. Not obedience. Something sharper.</p><p> </p><p>Then she noticed the pattern — the faint tremor at Agatha’s throat, the way her shoulders tensed before each inhale. Holding her breath.</p><p> </p><p>And then it stopped.</p><p> </p><p>The sudden release was small but enough to draw Rio’s attention. She hadn’t meant to stare, hadn’t meant to notice at all, but something about it struck her.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could decide what to do, Agatha spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“You seem tense, Your Majesty.”</p><p> </p><p>The words were light. Teasing. Irreverent.</p><p>For a second, Rio forgot to breathe altogether.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced down, startled, certain she must have misheard — but the look in Agatha’s eyes left no room for confusion.</p><p> </p><p>Then came the smirk. The whisper. The promise not to step on her toes.</p><p> </p><p>It was absurd. In the middle of ceremony, with half the realm watching, Agatha Harkness — <em>Lady Vidal</em> — was making jokes.</p><p> </p><p>And somehow, Rio felt the laugh rise before she could stop it. It caught in her throat instead, softened into a breath that almost became a smile.</p><p> </p><p>Almost.</p><p> </p><p>She reined it in, her composure snapping back into place as the music swelled.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t afford softness. Not here. Not now.</p><p> </p><p>But as they turned again — her hand steady on Agatha’s waist, the bond burning faintly beneath her glove — she couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted.</p><p> </p><p>That she’d just glimpsed the woman behind the veil, and she wasn’t at all what Rio had been prepared for.</p><p> </p><p>The music swelled, and the air itself seemed to move with it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio adjusted her grip, one hand at Agatha’s waist, the other guiding hers, and for the first time that day the world stopped watching. Or maybe she simply stopped caring that it was.</p><p> </p><p>The orchestra’s rhythm deepened — a waltz spun faster than decorum should have allowed, the kind meant to dizzy its dancers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha followed every turn effortlessly. The silk of her skirts flared like water catching light, brushing against Rio’s legs as they moved. Their steps fell into perfect time — cautious at first, then surer, sharper.</p><p> </p><p>A pivot. A sweep.</p><p>The floor gleamed beneath them like the surface of a river, their reflections chasing one another across polished marble.</p><p> </p><p>Rio led, and Agatha moved with her — not resisting, not yielding, but matching. Each motion mirrored the other’s will.</p><p> </p><p>The orchestra rose higher. She turned Agatha beneath her arm, silver chains caught the light like rain. A dip followed — Rio’s palm steady at her back, the scent of river salt and candle smoke between them.</p><p> </p><p>Her heartbeat matched the tempo — fast, pulsing, alive.</p><p> </p><p>Every nerve seemed to hum with the current that ran through the hall, through her veins, through the woman in her arms.</p><p> </p><p>The bond thrummed beneath her ribs, undeniable. It was there in the way their steps synced perfectly, in the way Agatha’s breath brushed her throat as she spun back into her hold.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t have to see it to know. The River was moving through them.</p><p> </p><p>They were the Source and the Confluence, circling, colliding, becoming one current for a fleeting, impossible moment.</p><p> </p><p>The music reached its crest — a rush of strings, a heartbeat of silence, and then the final note fell.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand was still at Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers still rested against her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>The hall erupted in polite applause.</p><p> </p><p>Neither of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>For that suspended breath between ending and separation, Rio swore she could still feel the River in her pulse — and Agatha’s matching it beat for beat.</p><p> </p><p>——-</p><p>The applause still thundered in Agatha’s ears long after the last step of the dance. The queen had slipped from her grasp; the music had stopped; nobles were bowing, clapping, whispering. And Agatha just… stood there.</p><p> </p><p>Heart pounding. Breath shallow. Skin too warm.</p><p> </p><p>That had been—</p><p> </p><p>No.</p><p>She wasn’t going to think about it.</p><p>Not here.</p><p>Not with half the world watching.</p><p>Not ever, if she could help it.</p><p> </p><p>She forced her hands to still at her sides, willing her pulse to quiet. But her body had other plans — everything felt too alive, too aware. And before she could process any of it, a sharp hand latched onto her elbow.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother.</p><p> </p><p>“Come,” she hissed, voice pleasant enough for the public, talons underneath. “You are needed.”</p><p> </p><p>Needed.</p><p>Of course she was.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let herself be steered through a side door, down a corridor thick with candlelight. The second the door clicked shut behind them, attendants descended like a flock — swift, silent, invasive.</p><p> </p><p>Her crown was lifted away.</p><p>Her veil unfastened.</p><p>Her jewels stripped.</p><p>Her heavy embroidered gown peeled off layer by layer until she stood in nothing but her shift, naked beneath her mother’s scrutiny.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother took her chin in a hard grip.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop looking like a startled doe,” she muttered. “You will behave. You will complete the rite. You will not embarrass this family again.”</p><p> </p><p>Again.</p><p> </p><p>The word lodged like a splinter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing.</p><p>There was nothing safe to say.</p><p> </p><p>Her attendants painted her again — not in golds and ochres this time, but in something softer. A glow to her cheeks, a touch of color to her lips. A temptation dressed up as duty. Then they slid her into an almost sheer ceremonial nightgown — elegant, expensive, humiliatingly fragile. The kind meant to display rather than protect.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother stepped back, satisfied.</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” she said. “Remember what is at stake. When you leave that chamber, there must be no doubt.”</p><p> </p><p>No doubt about what, exactly, she didn’t bother to clarify. She never had to. Agatha had grown up on those unsaid conditions, on the things implied rather than spoken aloud.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed back the tightness in her throat. Not fear. Something deeper — anger, maybe. Or resignation. Or the old, familiar sense of standing at the edge of a role someone else had written for her.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother led her through another corridor. The air shifted — cooler, heavier, thick with incense. She recognized the place before the doors even opened.</p><p> </p><p>When they did, Agatha found her wife already inside.</p><p> </p><p>The other woman stood rigid, flanked by a cluster of advisors and silver robed witnesses — a Tidekeeper among them, clutching ritual scrolls. Agatha’s mother moved near the back, examining her daughter’s appearance with clinical precision, as if assessing a negotiation rather than a person.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, but only for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>This was expected.</p><p>This was duty.</p><p>This was the part she had steeled herself for — the part she had quietly made peace with long before tonight. Blood, sheets, proof. There had never really been another path.</p><p> </p><p>The Tidekeeper stepped forward, voice carrying the heavy cadence of rehearsed scripture.</p><p> </p><p>“To complete the union before the eyes of the River, the rites must now be sealed.”</p><p> </p><p>Murmurs flickered through the room like sparks. The queen’s advisors took their positions; attendants lowered their gazes; Agatha’s mother’s chin lifted in satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>This was happening.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed once. She hated it. But she had prepared herself. She would endure. She always endured.</p><p> </p><p>Then the queen spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>The entire room snapped still.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, stunned. Advisors gasped softly. The Tidekeeper froze mid breath. One of the queen’s councilors leaned forward as if to correct her.</p><p> </p><p>“My Queen,” he whispered urgently, “the rite must—”</p><p> </p><p>The queen didn’t raise her voice.</p><p>She didn’t need to.</p><p> </p><p>“I do not believe this step is necessary tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her.</p><p> </p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Why now? Why here? Why like this?</p><p> </p><p>Humiliation rose hot and sharp in her chest. She did not want this ritual — she dreaded it — but she had prepared herself. She was ready to do her duty. She had braced for it, swallowed it, folded it into the shape of inevitability.</p><p> </p><p>Why couldn’t this woman just do the same and be done with it?</p><p> </p><p>Where did she get off embarrassing her?</p><p> </p><p>The room was painfully silent. This was a disaster waiting to happen. Not completing the rites could mean the entire union might be seen as illegitimate. That this would all have been for nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did not go through all of this for nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped forward.</p><p> </p><p>“If I may speak—”</p><p> </p><p>All eyes bar one pair in the room glared at her.</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s voice cut through the room like a blade.</p><p>“You may.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence swallowed everything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her chin — slowly, deliberately — and when she turned toward the queen, her sweet expression was a masterpiece of courtly poison.</p><p> </p><p>“With all due respect, Your Majesty,” she said, tone dripping honey, “while I appreciate your… concern… I also appreciate that the rites must be completed. I would hate to insult the Divine Mother, or the River’s councils, on our wedding night.”</p><p> </p><p>Her words seemed polite.</p><p>But her eyes leveled the queen like a knife.</p><p> </p><p>She walked toward her wife — unhurried, graceful, commanding her own body despite the humiliation coiling in her gut — and extended her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“I am prepared to fulfil my duty,” she said softly. “Whenever you are.”</p><p> </p><p>Dark eyes looked at her as though she were something entirely unexpected.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, the queen almost refused again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers remained outstretched.</p><p>Her gaze sharpened.</p><p> </p><p>The other woman inhaled slowly — one quiet surrender of breath — and took her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” she said, voice tight. “If my consort sees it fit… we may commence.”</p><p> </p><p>A collective exhale washed across the room. Relief. Tension ebbing. Advisors straightening. The Tidekeeper’s shoulders lowering as she muttered a prayer of thanks under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Together, Agatha and her wife crossed into the inner chamber.</p><p> </p><p>The door shut behind them with a heavy finality.</p><p> </p><p>And the moment they stepped inside the candlelit room — away from the witnesses, away from the eyes — they dropped each other’s hands like the touch had burned.</p><p> </p><p>The queen turned on her first.</p><p> </p><p>“Why would you do that?”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice was quiet — almost calm — but Agatha felt the blade under every syllable. Precision like that could cut deeper than shouting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, nails digging into her sleeves to mask the tremor in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Why would she do that?</p><p>Why would she save them both from being the laughingstock of two kingdoms?</p><p>Why would she protect a woman she had met only hours ago?</p><p> </p><p>The fury rose before she could cage it.</p><p> </p><p>“Why would I save us from certain humiliation?” she shot back, her tone sweet as honey and sharp as cracked glass. “Such a mystery.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen stared at her.</p><p>Not angry.</p><p>Not cold.</p><p> </p><p>Just startled.</p><p>Like she’d never been spoken to like this in her life.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated that she noticed.</p><p> </p><p>The queen stepped forward, jaw tight. “I wasn’t going to let them dictate what we—”</p><p> </p><p>“What we?” Agatha echoed, stepping toward her despite every instinct screaming Don’t you dare challenge her. “We, who met not half a day ago? We who just swore eternal loyalty in front of two realms and the River’s envoys?”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t wait for an answer — couldn’t.</p><p>If she stopped talking, she might stop breathing.</p><p> </p><p>“You nearly jeopardised the entire union,” she said, low, steady. “The council would never recognise the marriage as sealed without the rites. Not without the blood of my—”</p><p> </p><p>She cut herself off too late.</p><p>Her voice lodged in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>The queen flinched.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t prepared for the satisfaction that flickered under her ribs at that — tiny, shameful, burning bright.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed on before she lost her nerve.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that not what you wanted?” she demanded. “When you bought me?”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s jaw clenched.</p><p>A muscle twitched in her cheek — the first crack in her mask.</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha went on, mock formal, as if announcing herself to a court, “here I am. On your arm. In your chamber. Ready to complete the union you paid a kingdom’s ransom for. So what changed, Your Majesty?”</p><p> </p><p>The title hit the cold air like venom.</p><p> </p><p>The queen didn’t answer.</p><p>Her silence was heavy enough to break ribs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped closer — though her heart hammered so hard it felt like it might bruise itself against her ribs. She couldn’t stop. She had held her tongue her whole life, and now here was a woman powerful enough to ruin her who still hadn’t struck her down for speaking.</p><p> </p><p>Something in that was intoxicating.</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s jaw tightened. When she finally spoke, her voice was low, almost hoarse. “This was not what this union was supposed to be about.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then what is this about?” Agatha pressed. “Because I have no wish to be paraded like breeding stock either, but I came prepared to do my duty. You—” she jabbed a finger toward the queen’s chest before she lost her courage, “—are the one acting above it all.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s voice came out low, controlled. “This custom—”</p><p> </p><p>“—is tradition,” Agatha snapped. “To you it’s archaic. To my people, it’s sacred.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice wavered, barely, but she forced steel into it.</p><p> </p><p>“You humiliated me,” she said. “Before them. Before my mother. Before the River. Do you know what they will whisper?”</p><p> </p><p>The queen swallowed — actually swallowed — like the words hit her lungs instead of her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let up.</p><p> </p><p>“They’ll say I was too impure to touch. That a queen refused her bride on sight. That I was defective, or worse — dangerous.”</p><p> </p><p>She scoffed, folding her arms tighter to hide the way her fingers were shaking.</p><p> </p><p>“Say the word, and they’ll write songs about your noble restraint and my unlovable defects.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>She stood in the center of the chamber, rigid, breathing with that careful precision that looked like she was trying not to break something — or someone.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t trying to shame you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a hollow, humourless laugh. “Of course you weren’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“I truly wasn’t.” The queen’s voice was quiet, strained. “Where I’m from, a delayed rite is an inconvenience. A scandal, at worst. People gasp, then move on.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed softly. “That’s lovely for <em>your</em> people. Here it’s a stain. A curse. A confirmation that I’m exactly what they think I am.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice tightened.</p><p> </p><p>“They would blame me. Not you.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen flinched — just a fraction, but Agatha saw it.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t realise the weight of it,” the queen said. “In your kingdom. For you. I didn’t…”</p><p>Her jaw tensed, as if forcing the truth out cost her something.</p><p>“I should have. I am deeply sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched — barely noticeable, but real. Her anger loosened by inches, like fingers slowly unclenching around a blade.</p><p> </p><p>No one ever apologised to her.</p><p>Aside from perhaps Jen.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother certainly never had.</p><p>Advisors never had.</p><p>Suitors never had.</p><p>People didn’t apologise to girls like her.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know where to put the feeling that rose in her chest — too soft, too unfamiliar, too dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>The fight inside her — hot, sharp, desperate — wavered.</p><p>Sputtered.</p><p>Softened.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” she muttered, though the heat had drained from her voice. She rubbed at her wrist, suddenly aware of how tired she felt. “If you’re so set on not doing this, then…”</p><p> </p><p>A shaky breath escaped her before she could mask it.</p><p> </p><p>“Then I will not force you.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s shoulders eased — not fully, but enough to betray relief. And guilt. And something quieter that Agatha couldn’t yet name.</p><p> </p><p>Silence settled over them again, but this one felt less like a blade and more like a bruise — tender, aching.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands, fingers curling, uncurling, trying to find steadiness.</p><p> </p><p>“But the rite needs to be sealed,” she said at last, voice low but resolved. “One way or another.”</p><p> </p><p>The words hung between them like a drop of blood about to fall.</p><p> </p><p>——</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for her to respond.</p><p> </p><p>She turned with a kind of eerie composure, the storm inside her gone still in that frightening way a sea goes silent before a wave breaks. Her steps toward the ceremonial bed were measured, almost calm.</p><p>Rio exhaled — not fully, but enough that her shoulders eased for a heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>Until she saw the glint of silver between Agatha’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Her entire body went taut.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>The words tore out before she realized she’d moved.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. Didn’t hesitate. Didn’t give herself the mercy of fear.</p><p> </p><p>She dragged the jagged hairpin across her palm in one clean, practiced motion.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath stopped.</p><p> </p><p>“Making it believable,” Agatha said quietly, letting her blood fall in slow, crimson drops onto the pristine white sheet.</p><p> </p><p>Rio halted a few paces away.</p><p> </p><p>Not because of the blood.</p><p>Because of the conviction in her voice.</p><p>Because of the calm in her movements.</p><p>Because this girl — this stranger — was willing to wound herself rather than invite shame onto either of them.</p><p> </p><p>Who <em>was</em> she?</p><p> </p><p>“That’s—” Rio began, but her throat tightened, the word catching. Smart? Quick thinking? Making Rio feel things she should not be feeling?</p><p> </p><p>She stepped closer, voice low, steadier than she felt.</p><p>“Give me your hand.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted a brow, breath thin. “Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’ll look suspicious if the wound is clean,” Rio murmured, already reaching before she could talk herself out of it. “Let me. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>The please startled her.</p><p>And startled Agatha even more.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated — just a small hitch of breath, just the faintest flicker of… something. As if no one had ever asked her for anything gently.</p><p> </p><p>Then, slowly, she offered her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took it with a care she hadn’t planned on giving.</p><p>The cut was bright, pooling in Agatha’s palm.</p><p>Rio pressed her fingertips to the wound, and her magic rose instinctively — a warm current under her skin, soft, steady.</p><p> </p><p>The wound knitted closed.</p><p> </p><p>But something else moved too.</p><p> </p><p>A flicker beneath the skin.</p><p>A pulse.</p><p>Soft, deep, ancient.</p><p> </p><p>The bond.</p><p> </p><p>It surged like a buried ember catching flame.</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>For a moment too long, neither of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p> </p><p>And the world seemed to inhale.</p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha tore her hand back.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” she said—stiff, clipped, as though politeness might smother the spark burning under her skin. As though Rio hadn’t felt it too.</p><p> </p><p>Rio said nothing. She couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away and folded down the blood-marked sheet with mechanical precision. Then she climbed into the ceremonial bed, spine straight, shoulders rigid with exhaustion and something quieter.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll take the bed,” she said coolly, “since you’re so determined to be a gentleman.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood motionless.</p><p> </p><p>Then she nodded once — a silent surrender to a battle she didn’t understand.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>She retreated into the adjoining chamber, cloak whispering across stone as she forced each step to remain measured, regal, steady. Her mind was anything but.</p><p> </p><p>The door closed quietly between them.</p><p> </p><p>On one side of the wall, Agatha lay stiff beneath the thin blanket, her hand pressed to her chest as if she could calm what burned there.</p><p> </p><p>On the other side, Rio stood in the dark, palm pressed flat to her sternum, fingers resting over the exact same spot.</p><p> </p><p>Neither saw the other.</p><p>Neither spoke.</p><p> </p><p>But both reached for the same mark beneath their ribs.</p><p>And both felt it warm.</p>

Please forgive me if it looks a bit messier than usual this is the best I could do and honestly I dont want to look at this for a second longer.</p>
<p>Trust me I was just as shocked when I checked the word count an it was over 12k words. Mind you this fic was sitting at around 10k altogether before this chapter so i really truly hope you enjoy as literal blood sweat and tears went into this.</p>
<p>Exams are coming up though so hopefully this will be enough to get us through because i honestly dont know when next I’ll have a chance. Yet I say this nearly every time and still somehow update before i probabaly should. (My unfinished lab reports are crying in a corner begging for attention)</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing all of your thoughts in the comments. Thanks for reading &lt;3</p></blockquote>

<p>Agatha heard her leave in the early hours of the morning.</p><p> </p><p>The queen moved like someone trained to vanish before being noticed — steps light, breath held, the faint whisper of fabric passing through a room without disturbing a single thing. Another woman might have slept through it. Agatha did not. Her eyes had been open long before the queen rose from the sofa in the adjoining chamber.</p><p> </p><p>She had barely slept at all.</p><p>Neither had the queen.</p><p> </p><p>She knew this not because she had made a sound — far from it. The woman was so unnervingly quiet Agatha would have doubted she was truly there, would have assumed she’d imagined the presence entirely, <em>if not for the mark</em>.</p><p> </p><p>That damn, cursed, restless mark.</p><p> </p><p>It had throbbed under her ribs through every hour of the night, a soft, insistent tug that refused to let her forget she was not alone. It was as if the River itself disapproved of the wall between them — reminding her, with every pulse, that someone lay just beyond it. Someone she did not understand. Someone she had shouted at. Someone she now feared she had offended beyond repair.</p><p> </p><p>Every time she drifted toward sleep, the bond stirred warm and sharp, tugging her awake again.</p><p>Too close.</p><p>Not close enough.</p><p>It hummed like a warning. Or a reprimand. Or simply a presence refusing to be ignored.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lay on her back staring at the ceiling, hand pressed flat over the blanket where she knew the mark lay beneath. It still felt warm. Tender. Almost bruised.</p><p> </p><p>So by the time she heard the queen slip out, Agatha’s eyes were heavy, her pulse thin, her mind already picking apart every word she’d said the night before.</p><p> </p><p>Had she gone too far?</p><p>Had she been foolish?</p><p>Had she spoken to a reigning queen with a sharpness unforgivable in any court — let alone a court such as <em>hers</em>?</p><p> </p><p>Her stomach twisted.</p><p> </p><p>Of course she had.</p><p>Of course she’d ruined something before it began.</p><p> </p><p>The queen had every right to be furious. To avoid her. To plan whatever consequences awaited a bride who didn’t know when to hold her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>And yet…she would have had the chance to punish Agatha last night. She could have done whatever she had wanted with her and no one would have so much as blinked.</p><p>But the queen hadn’t yelled.</p><p>She hadn’t struck her.</p><p>Hadn’t even looked angry.</p><p> </p><p>She had apologised.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha still didn’t know what to do with that — with the softness under the armor, the gentleness she kept stumbling into.</p><p> </p><p>She flinched at the memory, at the way the queen’s fingers had touched her wounded hand — cautious, reverent — and how the mark had leapt like a live thing between them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to think about that.</p><p>She didn’t want to think about her wife.</p><p>She didn’t want to think about the bond.</p><p>She especially didn’t want to think about how empty the chambers felt now that the queen was gone.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha rose slowly, limbs heavy, as though sleep had finally desired to catch up with her the moment the queen slipped away. She wrapped a robe around her shoulders and crossed the floor barefoot, the stone cool beneath her feet. Dawn filtered through the high windows in a pale, uncertain light — the kind that made everything look soft and half imagined.</p><p> </p><p>The washroom mirror fogged slightly with the morning chill. Agatha wiped a clear arc across its surface with trembling fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Her own reflection stared back at her — pale, wide-eyed, hair  mussed from a night of restless turning. She looked too young. Too tired. Too bruised somewhere deep beneath the skin.</p><p> </p><p>She would have to amend that.</p><p> </p><p>But for that moment, she simply exhaled slowly.</p><p> </p><p>Then, with hesitant fingers, she loosened the collar of her nightrobe and pulled the fabric aside.</p><p> </p><p>There it was.</p><p> </p><p>The mark.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the bright, searing brand spoken of in old tales — no violent flare, no regular carved letters spelling destiny. It was subtler, like moonlight caught beneath ice. A soft warmth radiated from it, small but insistent, pulsing with a rhythm in sync with another’s heartbeat.</p><p>Not quite script, not sigil, but something in between.</p><p> </p><p>Old stories whispered that true soulmate marks carried the name of the other, but only in the language the River first spoke. A language scholars argued over, priests pretended to understand, but only the River itself truly remembered.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t decipher it.</p><p> </p><p>But she could feel it.</p><p> </p><p>Could feel the weight of its importance. Pulling her in without choice.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed her fingertips lightly to it.</p><p>Heat bloomed there.</p><p>Alive and aware.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snatched her hand back as if she’d touched a flame.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t supposed to be her story.</p><p>Not her fate.</p><p>Certainly not with <em>her</em> — a queen she had only just met, a woman who confused her greatly. Someone who could kill her in a heartbeat and no one would dare say a word.</p><p> </p><p>She gripped the edge of the basin to steady herself.</p><p> </p><p>The mark pulsed again, it was a gentle pressure, like a hand reaching without touching.</p><p> </p><p>It made something in her chest twist painfully.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want from me?” she whispered at her reflection, though she wasn’t sure whether she meant the mark… or the woman tied to it.</p><p> </p><p>Her throat tightened.</p><p>Her eyes burned.</p><p> </p><p>She hated this helpless feeling of not knowing, and even worse the unwanted hope threading itself through her fear.</p><p> </p><p>Everything from the day before swirled in her mind:</p><p> </p><p>The queen kneeling in front of her.</p><p>The queen untying her wrists with unexpected care.</p><p>The queen apologising to <em>her</em>.</p><p>The queen stopping the rite.</p><p>The queen’s expression… unreadable, restrained, impossible to name.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what any of it meant.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps the mark did.</p><p> </p><p>Judging by the way it kept pulsing — quiet, steady and impossible to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>She closed her robe hurriedly, as if hiding it would smother whatever it was trying to say.<em> It didn’t</em>. The warmth seeped through the fabric, soft against her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard and straightened her spine.</p><p> </p><p>She would not let herself be undone by this.</p><p>By a mark she didn’t ask for.</p><p>By a bond she didn’t understand.</p><p>By a queen left her confused with every interaction.</p><p>By a marriage she was not ready for.</p><p> </p><p>She forced her breathing into even counts — slow, practiced, the way she’d learned to survive her entire life. Composure layered itself over her like armor.</p><p> </p><p>But when she looked into the mirror again, the truth still stared back at her:</p><p> </p><p>She was afraid.</p><p>She was confused.</p><p>And despite everything, a part of her did care what her new wife thought of her.</p><p> </p><p>A part she knew she desperately needed to silence.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio closed the door behind her with a careful hand, though she barely remembered walking there. Sleep had not touched her the entire night. She had lain still throughout, rigid on the sofa as the girl had demanded while she slept on the bed with only  a wall dividing them. The bond had thrummed beneath her ribs from the moment they separated. A restless, watchful thing.</p><p> </p><p>Now, in the thin grey of dawn, it pulsed with a steadiness that made her throat tighten.</p><p> </p><p>She stripped off her cloak and set it aside on the chair, then loosened the fastenings at her collar with mechanical precision. Her body moved by habit, her mind was elsewhere — pulled inevitably to the faint heat burning under her sternum.</p><p> </p><p>It had grown stronger since she woke.</p><p> </p><p>Of course it had.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed the floor to the small mirror near the washbasin and forced herself to look.</p><p> </p><p>The mark shimmered faintly beneath her skin, a soft ripple of light that wasn’t quite visible yet wasn’t entirely hidden.</p><p> </p><p>As she looked closer, the glow resolved into lines — curved strokes, rising arcs, shaped exactly the way the River wrote its chosen truths.</p><p> </p><p>She knew the language instantly.</p><p> </p><p>The old tongue.</p><p>The first tongue.</p><p>The one spoken in every prophecy of binding.</p><p> </p><p>Her stomach dropped.</p><p> </p><p>Because the shape the light was forming…</p><p>Was a name.</p><p><em>Agatha Harkness</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Clear. Unmistakable.</p><p>Written in the River’s script across her ribs, as if carved there by fate itself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>Her pulse stuttered.</p><p>She felt the world tilt beneath her feet.</p><p> </p><p>This was real. It wasn’t a cruel nightmare. There was no escaping it.</p><p> </p><p>She was in deeper trouble than she’d perhaps ever been in her life.</p><p> </p><p>Her council would be in uproar if they knew.</p><p>The River Order would question her standing.</p><p>They would all look at Agatha as a distraction, a corruption, a threat to the throne.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard, jaw tightening until it ached.</p><p> </p><p>This bond endangered them both.</p><p> </p><p>But she could not tear her gaze from it.</p><p> </p><p>Because beneath all the fear, something else gnawed at her — something she shoved quickly back into the dark space it belonged.</p><p> </p><p>Her thoughts slid back, unwanted, to Agatha’s face the night before. Not the veiled bride.</p><p>Not the trembling girl forced beneath ceremony.</p><p>But the woman who had stood in front of her and <em>spoke</em> — openly, brazenly, sharply — as if Rio were not one of the most feared sovereign both sides of the River, but simply another person who needed to be told when she was wrong.</p><p> </p><p>Rio ran a hand over her face.</p><p> </p><p>She had expected meekness. Fear. Submission.</p><p> </p><p>Instead she’d been met with wit, intelligence, and a political instinct sharp enough to cut.</p><p> </p><p>She had understood the ramifications of refusing the rites  better than Rio herself had. And the way she had said it — not begging, not pleading, but stating facts with a sweetness that barely hid the blade beneath…</p><p> </p><p>It had startled her. More than that, it had… impressed her.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to think of that though.</p><p>Didn’t want to taste the truth of it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shut her eyes as though that could make all her problems disappear. But in doing so another set of eyes seared into her mind. Blue, shockingly so.</p><p> </p><p>A colour that caught light like riverwater at dusk.</p><p> </p><p>But it wasn’t the colour that unsettled Rio.</p><p> </p><p>It was the stories clearly stored in them.</p><p> </p><p>Pain she recognized.</p><p>Fear she understood too well.</p><p>A defiance she had not yet seen in any noble bride.</p><p>A loneliness that mirrored something in herself she refused to touch.</p><p> </p><p>She should have looked away quicker.</p><p>She shouldn’t have looked at all.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tore her eyes open and stepped away from the mirror now, heart hitting a painful rhythm beneath the mark.</p><p> </p><p>This could not continue.</p><p>Interest was a luxury she could not afford.</p><p>Attachment would only lead to ruin— for both of them.</p><p> </p><p>She had to control this.</p><p>Had to distance herself.</p><p>Had to pretend none of this existed.</p><p> </p><p>The girl could not know the effect she had.</p><p>The bond could not be given room to grow.</p><p> </p><p>Rio steadied herself against the basin, breathing through her nose until the trembling under her ribs dulled to a muted throb.</p><p> </p><p>Only then did she draw the washbasin nearer.</p><p> </p><p>Breakfast.</p><p>She would be expected there.</p><p>Appearances mattered, especially here, especially now.</p><p> </p><p>She could not appear looking like she’d spent the night wrestling ghosts, even if that was the truth.</p><p> </p><p>Layer by layer, she rebuilt herself.</p><p> </p><p>And only when every line sat perfectly, when her reflection resembled composure rather than chaos, did she allow herself one final breath.</p><p> </p><p>She would see Agatha again soon.</p><p> </p><p>She only hoped her pulse would not betray her.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>By the time Agatha returned to her chambers, the early morning light had fully settled over the castle. Pale sun washed across the stone floors, cold and unforgiving, reflecting off of every polished surface.</p><p> </p><p>The attendants had not lingered long in the ceremony room.</p><p>Three knocks.</p><p>A politely lowered gaze.</p><p>Hands moving with ritual precision as they collected the stained sheet.</p><p> </p><p>They had said nothing.</p><p>Nothing but the formal phrase:</p><p> </p><p>“Her Highness may return to her chambers.”</p><p> </p><p>But silence had never shielded Agatha.</p><p>Silence could wound as deeply as words.</p><p> </p><p>She had seen the pity in their eyes — soft, fleeting, but unmistakable. The kind people wore when they thought they were witnessing a tragedy from a safe distance. The queen had gone. The chamber had been empty save for Agatha herself. And though no one dared comment, every attendant had drawn the same conclusion:</p><p> </p><p>The new queen consort had been left alone.  Unwanted.</p><p> </p><p>Embarrassing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, closing the door behind her.</p><p> </p><p>The room felt too large, too quiet. Yesterday it had been buzzing with handmaidens and orders barked from her mother and the suffocating pressure of ceremony. Today it felt… hollow.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed to the vanity and sat carefully, as though something might break if she moved too quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Her reflection stared back — tired eyes, paler cheeks, faint smudges beneath her lashes from a night spent awake and afraid. The mark still warmed beneath her robe, but she refused to touch it again. She could not bear to look at it now, not while the understanding that every piece of her life teetered on the edge of someone else’s decisions pressed sharply on her mind.</p><p> </p><p>The queen had not punished her last night.</p><p> </p><p>But that didn’t mean she wouldn’t this morning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha picked up her comb, forcing her hand to steady. She tugged it through her hair slowly, careful not to snag or rush. She needed control. Needed order. Needed to appear once more like a woman who belonged by her side rather than someone the queen might regret choosing.</p><p> </p><p>If the queen regretted this union…</p><p> </p><p>If the queen decided Agatha had overstepped…</p><p> </p><p>If the queen chose to withdraw her protection…</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted.</p><p> </p><p>She could already imagine her mother’s expression.</p><p>The venom in her voice.</p><p>The humiliation.</p><p>The certainty that Agatha had failed at even this — the one chance she had to escape this miserable castle and the life laid out for her like a noose.</p><p> </p><p>She could not let that happen.</p><p>She <em>would not.</em></p><p> </p><p>She set the comb down and let her fingers move on their own. A simple half up twist, nothing elaborate, nothing that resembled ceremony. Her curls fell naturally over her shoulders, the rest drawn back and fastened with a small silver clasp she had acquired  weeks ago and never once been allowed to wear.</p><p> </p><p>The style framed her face just enough.</p><p>Not too soft.</p><p>Not too sharp.</p><p>A line between them.</p><p> </p><p>Plain compared to yesterday’s lacquered, ornate  creation — but plain suited her. Plain felt like breath. Like reclaiming something small and hers after a day that had taken too much.</p><p> </p><p>When she lifted her head again, the mirror returned a woman who did not beg for attention, yet was impossible to ignore entirely. A woman who could stand beside a queen without shrinking, without shining too brightly, without offering herself as a target.</p><p> </p><p>A careful choice.</p><p>A precise one.</p><p>Exactly as she needed to be.</p><p> </p><p>Next came the gown — midnight blue, the colour of deep water and quiet resolve. It fit her snugly, outlining her waist, grounding her in the shape of her own choosing. She smoothed the fabric as though it were a shield.</p><p> </p><p>She added a pin at her collar.</p><p>Something subtle.</p><p>Something elegant.</p><p>Something that might catch the queen’s eye before a frown did.</p><p> </p><p>Not to charm.</p><p>Not to entice.</p><p>Simply to avoid provoking.</p><p> </p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Untouchable.</p><p>Harmless.</p><p> </p><p>A woman a queen would not immediately regret binding herself to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her reflection once more. She saw the difference.</p><p>Yesterday she had been a dressed up relic of her mother’s design, a doll for ceremony.</p><p>Today she looked like herself — sharper, older, calmer, but no less frightened.</p><p> </p><p>Frightened enough to move carefully.</p><p>Frightened enough to protect the fragile future laid before her.</p><p>Frightened enough to try.</p><p> </p><p>She set her hands on the vanity’s edge and inhaled, long and slow.</p><p> </p><p>When she crossed paths with the queen this morning, she would smile.</p><p>She would speak sweetly.</p><p>She would not provoke.</p><p>She would not remind her of last night.</p><p> </p><p>She would survive this day.</p><p>She had to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rose, straightened her skirt, and stepped toward the door.</p><p> </p><p>Breakfast awaited.</p><p> </p><p>And so did whatever judgment the queen had decided upon.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The morning hall was quiet when Rio arrived, quieter than she expected. A long table stood untouched beneath the high windows, sunlight catching on the silverware, the steam rising from the small assortment of dishes. Only two places had been set.</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused.</p><p> </p><p>She had assumed incorrectly that advisors or ceremonial witnesses would be present. That someone would mediate the strained aftermath of the Rite. Instead, the emptiness seemed to press in around her, too intimate for comfort.</p><p> </p><p>She took her seat regardless, posture straight, hands folded neatly while she waited. The calm in her expression felt practiced, brittle at the edges.</p><p> </p><p>Footsteps approached soon after.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up and her breath caught.</p><p> </p><p>Her wife stood there with a steadiness that far outdid how Rio herself was feeling inside.</p><p> </p><p>Her hair was in loose curls that morning, unlike the elaborate coils of the day before. These were softer, more natural—half pulled back with a delicate twist and secured by a pretty clasp that caught the light as though it was crafted with that sole purpose in mind.</p><p>The gown she wore was plain compared to yesterday’s spectacle, but the simplicity of it suited her far better. Rio tried not to let her eyes linger in the way it hugged her hips in all the right spots. </p><p> </p><p>All the performance had been stripped away, yet Rio couldn’t but think she looked far more beautiful like this than before.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped her gaze before the thought could linger, but the impression remained—too clear, too vivid.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took her seat.</p><p> </p><p>The silence stretched at the table, weighing down until Rio heard herself speak.</p><p> </p><p>“I…like your hair.”</p><p> </p><p>As soon as the words slipped out, her pulse stumbled. She straightened her back, as if posture could disguise a lapse she had not meant to reveal.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her eyes, startled. Compliments were rarely gifts in her world, they were usually tools.</p><p> </p><p>“My hair?” she asked, the words careful, searching for what she might have missed.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” Her Majesty’s tone was light, quickly masked. “It suits you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha studied her—the queen’s stillness, the faint tension at the corner of her mouth. Nothing in the expression told her whether this was kindness, mockery, or some courtly subtlety she had not been trained to decipher.</p><p> </p><p>“…Thank you?” she managed at last.</p><p> </p><p>Something flickered across the queen’s face—quick, unreadable. Then she spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“It appears tidy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, then nodded once. “Well I’m pleased it’s to Her Majesty’s standards.” She replied with a tight smile.</p><p> </p><p>The queen said nothing more, only lifted her cup with a measured calm that made Agatha wonder whether she had somehow missed something entirely.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p><em>Gods why had she said that? </em>She had definitely offended the younger woman.  Rio tried to steer the conversation into safer grounds.</p><p> </p><p>She set her cup down, fingers steadying themselves against the porcelain.</p><p> </p><p>“I admit,” she began, keeping her tone formal, “I thought we would be joined by others this morning.”</p><p> </p><p>An expression passed through Agatha’s face before it was hastily smoothened away. “In my culture the first Mel is reserved for the couple alone after the Rite. To encourage unity I believe.”</p><p> </p><p>Unity.</p><p>A harmless word on her tongue.</p><p>A far more perilous one in Rio’s mind.</p><p> </p><p>She inclined her head in polite acknowledgment, though internally the thought was a quiet, sinking one:</p><p> </p><p><em>A private meal. With her. And my mind that refuses to co-operate. Perfect.</em></p><p> </p><p>The hall seemed smaller suddenly. Or perhaps it was only her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Breakfast lay untouched between them, steam curling upward as if unsure whether it was welcome.</p><p> </p><p>The strain between silence and speech stretched thin.</p><p>Not hostile.</p><p>Not warm.</p><p>Something uncertain, something new.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached for her utensils—anything to anchor herself—only to realize her hand wasn’t as steady as she’d hoped.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>They ate in a quiet that felt almost ceremonial. Agatha took a sip of tea, gathering her thoughts. If they were expected to build unity, she might as well try. And she needed to learn more about the kingdom she was meant to call home before long.</p><p> </p><p>She looked up, voice gentle but steady.</p><p>“Your Majesty… may I ask about your lands across the River?”</p><p> </p><p>The queen stilled, her gaze lowered briefly to her plate before she answered. “Ask away.”</p><p> </p><p>Not cold.</p><p>Not dismissive.</p><p>Just an opening — controlled, but still offered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha straightened subtly, encouraged by the permission though she wouldn’t show it.</p><p>“Are the forests truly as vast as the stories say? And the cities… I’ve heard they are unlike those in the East.”</p><p> </p><p>She asked gently, but precisely.</p><p>Not idle curiosity — strategic curiosity.</p><p>The queen’s eyes lifted, a flicker of something like surprise crossing them.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t expected Agatha to begin there — with land, with governance, with questions that revealed she was already imagining what life might look like beyond this castle.</p><p> </p><p>Most new brides asked about gowns, duties, court etiquette.</p><p>Agatha asked about terrain and infrastructure.</p><p> </p><p>“It is… temperate,” Rio answered.</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“Dense forests. Fertile land. The River binds most of it.”</p><p>Another beat.</p><p>“Our cities are… practical, but I think most would agree they’re beautiful too.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze didn’t waver. She waited, patient, quietly urging more.</p><p> </p><p>“It is peaceful,” Rio added at last, “when left to be.”</p><p> </p><p>The admission felt too close to honesty. She looked away.</p><p> </p><p>She watched the queen’s restraint with interest.</p><p>Tight answers, clipped but thoughtful. Agatha began to get the impression though that it was not out of lack of care, but perhaps caring too much.</p><p>Choosing words as if each one mattered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head.</p><p>“I’ve always heard your forests are beautiful,” she offered softly.</p><p>“And your cities—innovative. Far beyond what is found here.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen nodded carefully. “Yes, I would agree.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t offer anymore than that and Agatha tried not to let the disappointment bother her.</p><p> </p><p>The quiet stretched again, thinner now, charged in a different way.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha set down her cup. Then because she was apparently unable to help herself she spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“Is Your Majesty always this quiet in the mornings?”</p><p>A beat passed. “Or is my company particularly uninspiring?”</p><p> </p><p>The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them.</p><p><em>Stop. Stop doing that.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>***</em></p><p> </p><p>The question hit her like a hand closing around her throat — not harsh, not painful, but sudden, startling, intimate.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the tease that undone her. It was the fact that Agatha was watching closely enough to tease at all. The fact that she had noticed her silence, interpreted it, reached into it.</p><p> </p><p>It was being seen, plainly and without fear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked once, slowly. Her pulse quickened in a way she hadn’t felt in years. The edges of the room sharpened, every sound too crisp, the quiet too loud. Something inside her perked its head. She pushed it aside with haste.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waited for an answer — not mockingly, but what appeared to be earnest curiosity Rio was wholly unprepared for.</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt the bond hum under her ribs, low and persistent, responding not to proximity but to attention.</p><p> </p><p>She wished Agatha hadn’t asked.</p><p>She wished she could answer.</p><p>She wished she didn’t want to.</p><p> </p><p>Because a part of her —a part she had been trying to bury — did want to speak with her. Did want to follow the thread of Agatha’s mind, see where her thoughts curved, what she noticed, what she feared, what she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to understand her.</p><p> </p><p>And that was dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>Her jaw tightened. Her breath came uneven for half a second before she forced it still.</p><p> </p><p>“I am…”</p><p>The words caught.</p><p>She looked down at her hands as if they were betraying her.</p><p> </p><p>She felt too exposed.</p><p>Too readable.</p><p>Too close to forgetting herself.</p><p> </p><p>“I am finished,” she said quietly.</p><p>It was the safest truth she could offer.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed her plate aside with a composure she did not feel.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Finished?</p><p>Her stomach dropped, her heart tightening with the familiar sting of humiliation.</p><p> </p><p><em>You did it again. Always too sharp, always too much.</em></p><p> </p><p>But the queen’s expression wasn’t cold. It was… strained. As if something had pressed too close.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what to make of that.</p><p> </p><p>Her Majesty rose.</p><p> </p><p>“I should contact my advisors,” she said. “There are matters requiring attention.”</p><p> </p><p>Polite. Formal. Too quick.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lowered her gaze, trying to salvage dignity.</p><p>“I doubt your people are so helpless they cannot manage without you for the span of a meal.”</p><p> </p><p>She winced inwardly. <em>Stop speaking. Stop speaking.</em></p><p> </p><p>Her fingers tightened around her napkin, breath catching, but she refused to let it show. Fear would only make the moment crack wider, fear would make her small again, and she could not afford smallness now.</p><p> </p><p>So she straightened.</p><p> </p><p>Lifted her chin.</p><p> </p><p>Let her spine lengthen by instinct alone.</p><p> </p><p>Her heart hammered hard enough to rattle in her chest, but her face held steady. She raised her eyes to meet the queen’s, prepared for whatever expression waited there, because retreat would feel like surrender.</p><p> </p><p>And that, she could not bear.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The words halted her footsteps.</p><p> </p><p>She turned.</p><p> </p><p>Slowly.</p><p> </p><p>As if giving herself time to reassemble the lines of her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat poised at the table, chin lifted, eyes steady. No fear. No shrinking. Not even a polite flinch. Just a calm challenge tucked beneath courtesy.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze narrowed—not in anger, but in a stunned, startled focus.</p><p> </p><p>This girl.</p><p> </p><p>Bold enough to prod a queen mid exit.</p><p>Soft spoken enough to make it sound like nothing at all.</p><p>And wholly unaware of how close she stood to the edges of things she did not understand.</p><p> </p><p>Something flickered warm and unwelcome beneath Rio’s sternum, the bond tightening like a pulled thread.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t afraid of her.</p><p> </p><p>Not properly.</p><p>Not like everyone else.</p><p>Not the way she should be.</p><p> </p><p>And that—the absence of fear—terrified Rio far more than any defiance ever could.</p><p> </p><p>Because fear kept people alive around her.</p><p>Fear kept them distant.</p><p>Fear protected them from the gravity of her, from the curse of being tied to someone the whole world named a blade.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha looked at her as if she were merely a woman.</p><p>No monstrous shadow clinging to her crown.</p><p>No stain of legend.</p><p> </p><p>Just a person.</p><p> </p><p>It unsettled Rio so completely she almost forgot to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Intrigue curled at the edge of her thoughts, sharp as a thorn.</p><p>Amusement ghosted through her confusion—who teased the one the one the world referred to as Lady Death so lightly?</p><p>And beneath it all, a quiet dread.</p><p> </p><p><em>She should be afraid.</em></p><p><em>For her own sake.</em></p><p><em>For mine.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio held her gaze one heartbeat longer than she meant to—long enough for the air between them to tighten.</p><p> </p><p>Then she inclined her head, the only gesture she could trust not to betray her.</p><p> </p><p>And turned away before those blue eyes could drag her deeper.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat very still, watching the doorway long after the queen had gone.</p><p> </p><p>Her cheeks burned.</p><p>Her pulse thudded at her throat.</p><p> </p><p>She had no idea what that look had meant.</p><p> </p><p>But it frightened her less than how much she suddenly wanted to understand it.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>By the time Rio reached her chambers her mind was running faster than a race horse.</p><p> </p><p>The door closed behind her with a muted finality, the sound softer than it should have been for how sharply it landed in her chest. For a moment she simply stood there, one hand still resting against the wood, breathing as though she had climbed too many stairs too quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Breakfast lingered in her nerves like an echo.</p><p>Agatha’ voice.</p><p>Her eyes.</p><p>That look — sharp, curious, unafraid in a way that unsettled her more than fear ever could.</p><p> </p><p>Rio began to get the creeping suspicion she was wholly unequipped to deal with the anomaly that was her new wife.</p><p> </p><p>She had crossed the room to where her mirror still lay.</p><p> </p><p>This was truly all Lilia’s fault. Was it not her who had pulled Rio’s hand towards this marriage? And now it was Rio having to deal with the ramifications of that decision.</p><p> </p><p>If anyone deserved to be dragged into this mess it was her.</p><p> </p><p>She raised her hand.</p><p> </p><p>The glass clouded under her touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia”</p><p> </p><p>The mirror darkened, then brightened again. Lilia’s face emerged from the surface, lines of concern already etched deeper than they had been the last time they spoke.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes sharpened the moment she saw Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“…You look awake,” Lilia said carefully. Not in pleasantry. A question.</p><p> </p><p>“You could say that,” Rio replied.</p><p> </p><p>A pause.</p><p> </p><p>“How have things been? We have not spoken since before the wedding.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated—only a second but she saw the crease of Lilia’s brow.</p><p> </p><p>“Things have been…eventful.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence stretched between them, taut as a drawn thread. Lilia did not rush her. She never did. She simply waited, watching the way Rio stood too still, the way her gaze refused to settle.</p><p> </p><p>“What is this Rio,” Lilia said at last. “You did not summon me for nerves.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s expression shifted. The warmth faded, replaced by something colder, sharper — the look she wore when matters of state turned dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>“If something occurred,” she said quietly, “something that affects the balance of power, you must tell me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened.</p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then tell me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked away. The words suddenly stuck in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia leaned closer to the glass, voice lowering. “Is it—”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>The word cut clean and fast.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia stilled.</p><p> </p><p>They held each other’s gaze through the mirror, something old and unspoken moving between them. Lilia searched Rio’s face once more, then inclined her head slightly, accepting the denial — but not dismissing the fear that had prompted the question.</p><p> </p><p>“…Then what?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>“Something happened during the ceremony…when we touched hands,” she said finally.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s breath caught.</p><p> </p><p>“I felt… something,” Rio continued, choosing each word with care. “And I know she did too.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s face had gone pale now. “Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t imagine it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Speak plainly.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes for a brief moment. When she opened them again, the truth was already there.</p><p> </p><p>“A soulbond,” she said. “It has awakened.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia did not speak.</p><p> </p><p>The mirror reflected only her stillness, her attention narrowing inward, calculating, measuring fallout before it had even begun.</p><p> </p><p>“You <em>think</em>,” Lilia said carefully.</p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>Another silence — this one longer, more dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>When Lilia finally nodded, it was slow. Grave.</p><p> </p><p>“This cannot be allowed to surface,” she said. “You know that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Especially not there.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s voice softened only slightly. “You must not let anyone suspect. Not your council. Not her family. Not the court you are standing in.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands curled at her sides.</p><p> </p><p>“And the girl?” Lilia asked. “How is she taking it?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>“She doesn’t understand it,” she said. “Not yet.”</p><p> </p><p>“But?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled. “She’s… perceptive.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s eyes flicked sharply upward. “That is not what I asked.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s silence answered anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“She challenges you,” Lilia said. Not accusing. Observing.</p><p> </p><p>“She speaks her mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you allow it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth tightened. “She isn’t afraid.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s gaze sharpened further. “That is dangerous.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do not confuse fascination with safety, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not—”</p><p> </p><p>“Then why does your voice change when you speak of her?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stiffened.</p><p> </p><p>“I am not attached.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia studied her for a long moment. “Then do not become so.”</p><p> </p><p>The words landed hard.</p><p> </p><p>“For her sake as much as yours,” Lilia continued. “Distance will feel cruel. But it is mercy. At least until you are home.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s chest ached at that — an ache she refused to examine too closely.</p><p> </p><p>“She has already been displaced,” Rio said quietly. “I don’t wish to make her feel cast aside.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s expression softened — just for a heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>“That impulse,” she said, “is exactly what you cannot afford.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“Appearances must be preserved,” Lilia continued. “And bonds — awakened or not — grow fastest when given room.”</p><p> </p><p>The implication settled heavily between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded once. Then, after a moment—</p><p> </p><p>“We should leave,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia blinked. “Leave?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sooner than planned.”</p><p> </p><p>Understanding flickered across Lilia’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“…That may be wise,” she said slowly. “If you are certain.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s answer came without hesitation. “I am.”</p><p> </p><p>The mirror dimmed.</p><p> </p><p>“Be careful,” Lilia said, her voice softer again. “With yourself. And with her.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio inclined her head.</p><p> </p><p>The glass went dark.</p><p> </p><p>She stood alone once more, the echo of the bond stirring beneath her ribs — restless, watchful, far too alive for her liking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tightened her grip on the edge of the table until the feeling dulled.</p><p> </p><p>Distance, she told herself.</p><p> </p><p>Just until they were home.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha had sat there until she could no longer hear the queen’s footsteps retreating. Until even the last whisper of her presence had thinned into distance.</p><p> </p><p>Until the bond began its usual cruelty.</p><p> </p><p>A quiet, insistent tug beneath her ribs, mapping a soulmate just out of reach, as if the River itself wanted to drag her after her by the wrist. As if it wished her to follow.</p><p> </p><p>She would do no such thing.</p><p> </p><p>No, Agatha sat there, fingered clenched tightly around the edge of the table until her knuckles ached, until the queens presence was far enough away that she felt as though she could breathe once again without her breath catching on something sharp.</p><p> </p><p>And then she rose.</p><p> </p><p>She abandoned her own unfinished dish with the same grace—though far less urgency—as the queen. The guards did not stop her when she exited the room, nor when she walked through the side gate exiting the castle and entering the gardens. They did not stop her as she snuck through the garden gates either, heading down the familiar path towards the one place she aways sought out for refuge, or enlightenment.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps it was pity.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps it was simple indifference.</p><p> </p><p>Either way, it worked in her favour. Not a soul spoke to her the entire walk, though she could feel eyes in the quiet behind her—soft as dust, heavy as judgment.</p><p> </p><p>Now she sat perched on a smooth river rock, the chill seeping through her skirts, her mind a hooded thing full of teeth.</p><p> </p><p><em>Idiotic.</em></p><p><em>Fool.</em></p><p><em>You have done it again.</em></p><p> </p><p>The thought came in like a lash from one corner of her skull, the voice of survival dressed up as righteousness.</p><p> </p><p><em>You can never just keep your mouth shut, and one of these days you will pay for it with your life.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, lowering her head to her hands, her hands slid back in frustration pressing the palms of them to her temple while fingers curled into the roots of her hair and tugged.</p><p> </p><p><em>You were meant to soften her. Distract her from last night. Not lay fresh kindling at her feet.</em></p><p> </p><p>Her fingers found the little hair brooch at the back of her head, pretty and useless, and tore it free. The neat twists she’d forced into order unravelled at once, curls loosening and spilling down her shoulders like her body had been waiting to undo the lie.</p><p> </p><p>She stared at the clasp in her palm.</p><p> </p><p>What was the point?</p><p> </p><p>Nothing would distract from her disrespect now—not the careful gown, not the pinned hair, not the practiced poise. The queen was likely already weighing the shape of her punishment, or worse—speaking to the council, to Agatha’s mother, saying the words that would end this before it properly began.</p><p> </p><p><em>This marriage cannot work.</em></p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha had no manners. Because Agatha could not be managed. Because Agatha was not worth the trouble.</p><p> </p><p>She could almost hear her mother’s voice wrapping around it like silk over a blade.</p><p> </p><p>And then there was the money—five million crowns, tossed at an auction like it meant nothing at all. Agatha’s stomach turned at the thought, at the absurdity of it, at how little sense it still made. Who spent that much on a stranger? On a bride they did not need to win?</p><p> </p><p>Why had the queen done it?</p><p> </p><p>What did she want from Agatha?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had hoped that by now she would have an answer, something solid she could hold up to the light and understand. Instead each interaction only left her more off balance, more painfully aware that she was walking a corridor she could not see the end of.</p><p> </p><p>There were moments where Agatha almost thought she saw something gentle behind those eyes, something that strayed so far from all the stories and legends it almost made her head hurt. Then it would vanish, locked behind an impenetrable wall. Agatha could not tell what game they were playing but it felt as if she were being blindfolded half the time and walked around blind.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did not like walking blind.</p><p> </p><p>She liked to know what she was up against. Liked to know how small she had to make herself, or how sharp her bite had to be, depending on who stood in front of her. With her mother, the rules were carved into stone. With courtiers, the games were predictable. With fear, at least, she understood the language.</p><p> </p><p>But with the queen—</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could not find the balance. Not the right shape of compliance that kept her alive, nor the right measure of defiance that let her keep a scrap of pride.</p><p> </p><p>And worse than all of it—worse than the fear, worse than the confusion—was the quiet, humiliating truth pressing at her ribs like a bruise:</p><p> </p><p>That the bond still pulled.</p><p> </p><p>Even now.</p><p> </p><p>Even as she sat here and told herself she would not follow.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t be certain how long she sat there, before she was pulled from her thoughts. Her name was called from behind, tugging at her attention with far more gentleness than the bond she was still trying to strangle into compliance.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>She recognised the cadence without even turning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut for a heartbeat, as if that might turn the voice into one more thought she could ignore. It did not. When she looked up, Jen was standing at the edge of the bank, skirts gathered in one hand, curls pulled half loose by the wind.</p><p> </p><p>“I knew I would find you here,” Jen said, picking her way over the stones. “You always run to the River when the walls start to press in.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed something that might have been a laugh on a kinder day. “I did not run.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I bet you didn’t” Jen said mildly, coming to stand beside the rock. “You fled with great dignity.”</p><p> </p><p>Despite herself, the corner of Agatha’s mouth twitched. It vanished as quickly as it came. “How’d you slip past your mother?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen let out a small huff of a laugh at that. “I could ask you the same question.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother restraining an eye roll. “Haven’t seen that woman since last night, thank the River.” She dipped the toe of her slippers into the river water lapping at the rocks. “I suppose the deed is done, she has gotten what she desires, along with the council and the queen. She has little need to converse with me now, other than to remind me not to make a mess of this union.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen did not speak straight away, simply watched Agatha with one of those looks that made Agatha’s skin itch. Not because it was full of pity, Jen rarely looked at her with pity. No, it was the knowingness in her eyes. A look that felt as if she could see past all the carefully constructed walls and barriers Agatha had build around herself to fence off the outside world. Jen was aways too good at breaking into places she shouldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“How was last night?” She asked gently, as though speaking to a skittish animal who was known to flee at the slightest sign of danger—Agatha wouldn’t comment on the accuracy of that comparison.</p><p> </p><p>“Eventful,” she provided, through clenched teeth. “We performed our duties and went to sleep.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm. Sounds riveting.” Jen narrowed her eyes. “You’re sure nothing else occurred? You can tell me, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing else occurred last night Jen, this isn’t one of your sordid books you sneak from your mother’s chambers.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that Agatha. What I want to know is why you look so pained right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I always look pained,” Agatha snapped “This isn’t a particularly enjoyable time in my life.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, you often look like someone who’s sucked on a sour lemon, and yes, things have been even harder as of late, but I know you, Agatha. Since we were little girls. And the way you looked on that alter yesterday? I saw the moment something shifted in your face, this is more than just unease or frustration about a marriage I know you did not want. You might be able to fool the rest of those mutton heads but you cannot fool me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded in her chest so hard it almost muted out the still-buzzing bond. What did Jen see exactly? Did anyone else notice? Were they that obvious?</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not hiding anything.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t say you were hiding anything,” Jen replied. “At least not outright.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do not know what you would like me to say Jen.”</p><p> </p><p>“The truth” Jen said softly, holding Agatha’s gaze. “Has she…hurt you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” It came out more forcefully than it should have, for someone who’d just been imagining all the way in which their wife was going to punish them. “I mean, not yet. Surprisingly.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen watched her again, eyes searching as if hunting for any trace of a lie.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” she said slowly. “Then what is it? I know it’s something, I just can’t put my finger on it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down, focusing her attention on the gentle currents of the river. She weighed it out. Yes, this was a secret that could be the end of her if it were ever to come out. The Order would be on her the moment they caught a whiff of proof that she was bound not just to any woman in power, but to a queen. They’d consider her too big a threat. A corruption at the throne.</p><p> </p><p>But this was Jen. Jen, who had been her closest and only friend for as long as she could remember. Besides, Agatha wasn’t sure she could hold this secret between just her and the queen. Maybe sharing it with Jen would make it feel less suffocating. Less…intimate.</p><p> </p><p>She took in a shuddering breath. “Something did happen yesterday,” she admitted, chancing a glance in Jen’s direction. “Not during the rites, but during the ceremony.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen said nothing, just continued watching her, a small scrunch forming between her brows.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re right. Something…shifted. When we touched hands during the handfasting I—we felt something. Something here.” She touched the spot where the mark lay beneath her dress.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s eyes widened. Agatha saw the moment it clicked. “Surely you don’t mean… Agatha, are you saying that the queen—the Lady Death—is your—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot out a hand and clapped it over Jen’s mouth before the word could form.</p><p> </p><p>“Do not say it,” Agatha hissed out, voice low and hard. “Not here. Not anywhere. Not to anyone.”</p><p> </p><p>Slowly, she let her hand fall.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s voice, when it came, was barely a whisper. “So it’s true?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away, out over the slow, indifferent current. For a long moment she said nothing. Her thumb worried at the little clasp in her palm until the metal bit into her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“It does not matter,” she said at last.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course it matters.”</p><p> </p><p>“It does not.” She cut across her, forcing the words to lie flat. “Soul ties are for stories told to foolish girls who have not yet learned better. I am not a child, Jen. I am the Queen’s Consort now. This union is a bargain, not a ballad. It is crowns and borders and treaties, and it will remain so. Whatever the River chose to carve into my chest changes nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen flinched, like the sharpness caught her instead. “You do not believe that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I must.” Agatha’s throat felt tight; she swallowed it down. “She is a queen. She is Lady Death. She did not come to my mother’s hall seeking a wife, she came seeking an ally. You did not see her face when the bond appeared, Jen. I did.” Her laugh broke in the middle, humourless. “She looked as though the floor had opened under her feet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps she was frightened,” Jen said softly. “Anyone would be.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head. “She does not want this.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you?” Jen asked.</p><p> </p><p>It landed like a thrown stone. For an instant, the answer flared up fast and hot and terrifyingly honest. <em>yes</em>. Something in her reached toward that bond like a thirsty thing.</p><p> </p><p>She caged it behind her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Nor do I,” she said, and the lie tasted like River silt. “This… mark, this pull, whatever name you give it—it will not rule my life. I will do my duty, and Queen Vidal will do hers. That is the shape of it.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen stared at her, disappointment softening into something more like grief. “Agatha—”</p><p> </p><p>“But nothing,” Agatha snapped, the words slicing sharp enough to cut her own tongue. “Do not make songs out of this, Jen. There is nothing beautiful in it. There is a woman who paid five million crowns for a stranger and now likely regrets it, and another  who has never been trusted with her own future, bound together whether they like it or not.”</p><p> </p><p>The wind pulled at her loose hair; she pushed it back with an impatient hand.</p><p> </p><p>“You know how they speak of soul ties when politics is involved,” she murmured, bitterness dropping low. “How they are watched. Controlled. Turned into weapons or omens. I will not have my life put on a pyre for the court’s amusement. Not anymore than it already is. So you will not speak of this. Not to your parents. Not to your friends in the infirmary. Not to anyone at all.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen gave a half smile. “You ask much.”</p><p> </p><p>“I ask what I must.” Agatha’s gaze finally came back to hers, raw and fierce. “You are the only soul in this kingdom I trust. Do not make me a fool for it.”</p><p> </p><p>Something in Jen’s expression broke at that. She stepped forward and wrapped her arms around Agatha, pulling her in before she could lean away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went stiff on instinct, then sagged the smallest fraction, breath catching against Jen’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“All right,” Jen whispered into her hair. “All right. I will keep your secret. I will not say a word. But Agatha—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, bracing.</p><p> </p><p>“—no matter what names you give it,” Jen finished, voice rough, “it is still yours. No council, no queen, no Tidekeeper can unmake that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>The River moved on beside them, quiet and relentless, as the bond thrummed low beneath her ribs like a second, unwelcome heartbeat.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>By the time they turned back toward the castle, the sun had climbed higher, and Agatha’s composure felt stitched together with thin, fraying thread rather than raw panic.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Jen said at last, nudging her shoulder lightly. “Aside from being soul branded at your own wedding, how was breakfast?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned. “Do not call it that.”</p><p> </p><p>“What, breakfast?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know very well which part I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s mouth twitched. “Did she glare at you the whole time? Did lightning strike the table? Did she turn your cup to ash with a single look?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped to the flagstones. “She…complimented my hair.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen actually stopped walking for half a step. “Your hair.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. Apparently it ‘suits’ me.” Agatha’s mouth twisted. “Then she told me it looked tidy.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen stared at her, scandalised on principle. “Tidy?”</p><p> </p><p>“You see my dilemma.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, that is not a disaster, that is just… socially awkward.”</p><p> </p><p>“It is unnerving,” Agatha insisted. “Compliments are weapons in these halls. You know that. I do not know what to do with one that sounds almost…” She trailed off, groping for the word and refusing to land on <em>genuine</em>. “Unpractised.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s expression softened a little. “And then?”</p><p> </p><p>“We ate in silence.” Agatha exhaled, a thin breath. “I attempted to speak of her lands. Of the forests, the cities, anything at all that might prove I would not be completely useless as a consort. She answered, but every word felt measured, as if she feared saying too much by accident.”</p><p> </p><p>“That sounds more like her being careful than you being unbearable,” Jen pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps.” Agatha rubbed at the line of her brow. “And then my mouth betrayed me. Again. I asked if she was always that quiet in the mornings, or if my company was particularly uninspiring.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen choked properly this time. “You did not.”</p><p> </p><p>“I did,” Agatha said grimly. “I might as well have hurled myself into the River and saved everyone the trouble.”</p><p> </p><p>“And what did she say?”</p><p> </p><p>“She said she was finished.” The words still sat heavy in her chest. “Pushed her plate aside, stood, said she must contact her advisors.” Agatha’s lips pressed together. “She could not get away fast enough.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen frowned, thinking it through. “That could mean she was unsettled. Not that she hated you.”</p><p> </p><p>“It means she was finished,” Agatha said, echoing the queen’s tone without meaning to. “Finished with the food. Finished with the conversation. Finished with… me. Take your pick.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen shook her head, curls bouncing. “You are very quick to convict yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“Someone has to,” Agatha murmured. “The rest of them will be only too happy to follow.”</p><p> </p><p>They passed beneath an archway and into the cool shadow of the inner hall. Stone closed around them again, the light sharper as it filtered through high windows and tapestries. Agatha drew in a slow breath, bracing herself for the familiar press of walls and watching eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Still,” Jen said, quieter now, “for what it’s worth… if she truly couldn’t stand you, I doubt she would waste time complimenting your hair at all. Tidy or otherwise.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a noncommittal sound, unwilling to give the thought a shape.</p><p> </p><p>She was about to offer some wry deflection when the sound hit her.</p><p> </p><p>It met them before they even turned the last corner—a low, busy murmur where there should have been quiet. The dull thud of trunks being dragged over stone. The scrape of wood. The rustle of linen. Voices pitched low in the particular tone of people trying very hard not to be noticed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s steps faltered.</p><p> </p><p>Jen glanced at her, then forward, brows drawing together. “That’s your wing,” she murmured.</p><p> </p><p>They rounded the corner.</p><p> </p><p>Servants clogged the corridor outside Agatha’s chambers. Two footmen strained under the weight of a large chest, angling it toward the stair. A maid hurried past with an armful of folded dresses. Cupboard doors gaped open; drawers stood half pulled, their contents stripped. The air smelled of dust and cedar shavings and thin, anxious sweat.</p><p> </p><p>For a heartbeat, Agatha’s mind refused to arrange any of it into sense.</p><p> </p><p>Then one of the maids stepped out of her doorway carrying a familiar shawl.</p><p> </p><p>Blue, worn soft at the edges. Her mother’s old shawl. The only thing from that woman Agatha had ever kept.</p><p> </p><p>It was being laid neatly into a trunk alongside the midnight gown she had worn only the other day, its deep fabric already half swallowed by linen.</p><p> </p><p>“That is mine,” Agatha heard herself say.</p><p> </p><p>She moved without thinking, skirts brushing past a footman as she crossed to the open trunk. The maid holding the gown started and nearly dropped it.</p><p> </p><p>“My lady—”</p><p> </p><p>“What,” Agatha said, each syllable very clear, “are you doing with my things?”</p><p> </p><p>The girl’s eyes flew to the floor. “We were told to—”</p><p> </p><p>“By whom?” Agatha demanded. Her pulse beat sharp in her ears. “Who ordered this?”</p><p> </p><p>The maid’s mouth opened and closed, trapped between terror and duty. Around them, the corridor stilled; every servant seemed to find an urgent reason to look anywhere but at their new queen consort.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said softly, a warning threaded through her name.</p><p> </p><p>“By whom?” Agatha repeated, not looking away from the maid.</p><p> </p><p>“Do not terrorise the staff, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>The familiar voice slid down the hall like cold water.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went rigid. Slowly, she turned.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother stood at the far end of the corridor, hands folded, gown immaculate. Two of her friends—wives of minor councillors—lingered a few paces behind, pretending decorous disinterest while their eyes gleamed with it.</p><p> </p><p>“Mother,” Agatha said, jaw tight.</p><p> </p><p>“Really,” her mother went on, approaching at an unhurried pace, “must you glare at them so? They are only doing as they were told.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled until her nails bit into her palms. “And what, precisely, were they told?”</p><p> </p><p>“To pack,” her mother replied. Her gaze swept over the open door, the half-emptied chamber beyond, and a small, satisfied smile brushed the corner of her mouth. “You will not be needing these rooms much longer.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p> </p><p>Jen shifted closer to her shoulder, silent, solid. Agatha could feel her there without looking.</p><p> </p><p>“I do not understand,” Agatha said, her voice thin around the edges. “No one has said—”</p><p> </p><p>“Her Majesty has decided to depart sooner than planned,” her mother said, as if remarking on the weather. “Naturally, when a queen expresses a preference, we move quickly to accommodate it.”</p><p> </p><p>The words hit like a stone.</p><p> </p><p>“Sooner,” Agatha echoed. “How much sooner?”</p><p> </p><p>Her mother’s brows rose, delicately amused. “At first light.”</p><p> </p><p>The corridor tilted.</p><p> </p><p>“As in… tomorrow?” Agatha asked, though she already knew the answer.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you imagine she meant a fortnight hence?” her mother replied lightly. “Tradition is charming, but hardly binding. Queens are not required to linger in provincial halls for two weeks simply to satisfy old ladies’ gossip.”</p><p> </p><p>Heat flared under Agatha’s skin—humiliation, sharp and blinding. Her throat worked around it.</p><p> </p><p>“The arrangement was—”</p><p> </p><p>“The arrangement,” her mother cut in, silk hardening to steel, “was that you would wed her and leave with her when she wished. That you would not disgrace us. That, for once, you would not make things difficult.”</p><p> </p><p>A faint flush had risen along her mother’s cheekbones now, the only sign of strain.</p><p> </p><p>“And yet here we are,” she went on. “Her Majesty can scarcely wait to be gone. You must have truly bored her if she is this eager to flee back to her duties this soon after the wedding.”</p><p> </p><p>Her mothers inquisitive friends let out callous snickers at that behind their fans. Agatha felt her cheeks burn.</p><p> </p><p>“That is not fair,” Jen said, before Agatha could find her breath. “My lady, you cannot know—”</p><p> </p><p>“My conversation with my daughter is no concern of yours,” her mother said, not even granting Jen a glance. “Attend to your own family’s standing before you meddle with mine.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s jaw snapped shut. Agatha flinched as if struck in her place.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother’s attention slid back to her, cold and appraising. “I did warn you, Agatha. All you had to do was present yourself politely, speak when spoken to, and avoid any…unseemly displays. You must not have listened, I can only imagine what you have done while you two were alone to have Her Majesty fleeing for her own court before the ashes have cooled.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug crescent moons into her palms.</p><p> </p><p>“You do not know why she wishes to leave,” she managed. “You were not there.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know enough,” her mother replied. “I know custom. I know that no bride in living memory has been taken from her bridal house as quickly as you are about to be. I know that a queen who is pleased with her choice does not bolt the morning after.”</p><p> </p><p>Each word found its mark, slicing through the thin, frayed thread of Agatha’s composure.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere beneath her ribs, the bond pulsed once—sharp and unbidden—like a hand reaching for hers. It only made the humiliation worse. That treacherous connection, tugging her toward a woman who apparently could not endure a handful of days in her presence.</p><p> </p><p>“If Her Majesty wishes to return to her court, she is free to do so,” Agatha said stiffly. “I am sure she has far more important matters to attend to than lingering here.”</p><p> </p><p>Her mother’s smile sharpened. “Such loyalty. You do realise it is yourself you condemn with such words? The halls will say she could not wait to be rid of you. That is what they will remember. Not her duties. <em>You.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. For an instant, she thought she might be sick.</p><p> </p><p>“You speak as though I had any say in this,” she said. “If the queen sent word, why was I not told?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, but you <em>are</em> being told,” her mother replied. “Now.” She waved a hand, as though dismissing a minor detail. “Her messenger arrived some time ago. Naturally, preparations began at once. There was hardly any point disturbing you at your little river tryst when there was work to be done.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flamed. Jen bristled beside her, hands balling into fists.</p><p> </p><p>“You might have allowed Her Majesty to tell me herself,” Agatha said, voice very low.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother’s eyes cooled further. “Do not be childish. Queens do not run about delivering their own tidings like housemaids. She entrusted us to make ready. Consider yourself told.”</p><p> </p><p>The final word fell with the weight of a door slamming.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, the corridor blurred at the edges. Agatha was distantly aware of her own pulse roaring in her ears, of the ache in her throat, of Jen’s fingers just brushing the sleeve of her gown as if asking for permission to steady her.</p><p> </p><p>“You will wish to see what is being taken,” her mother said briskly. “And perhaps say farewell to these rooms. You will not see them again after tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>She inclined her head a fraction, the barest shadow of courtesy. “Try not to weep on the carpets. They have only just been cleaned.”</p><p> </p><p>With that, she turned and swept back down the corridor, her little retinue trailing after like a flock of well trained birds.</p><p> </p><p>Silence rushed in behind her.</p><p> </p><p>The servants resumed their work in muted fashion, eyes skittering away from Agatha’s like minnows. The trunk lids lowered more softly now, as though even wood could feel the strain in the air.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood very still.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said, quietly.</p><p> </p><p>The name sounded as if it came from a long way off. Agatha stared down into the open trunk before her, at the shawl and gown and neatly folded shift—her life reduced to careful layers of cloth and cedar chips.</p><p> </p><p>“She could have told you herself,” Jen went on. “It was cruel not to.”</p><p> </p><p>“She is a queen,” Agatha said. Her voice held steady, to her faint astonishment. “She does not waste time on such things.”</p><p> </p><p>“That is not an excuse,” Jen muttered.</p><p> </p><p>“It is an explanation,” Agatha replied. “Besides, it makes sense. Why would she stay? Our…predicament is a problem. I am a problem. Better to cut her losses quickly and flee back to where she can toss me in a corner and forget I exist.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do not do that,” Jen said sharply. “Do not speak of yourself as if you were some spoiled piece of fruit she is tossing aside.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips twisted. “What would you have me say?” She dragged her gaze from the trunk at last, meeting Jen’s eyes. “That this is a grand romance? That she is whisking me away early because she cannot bear to be parted from me?” The bitter taste of the words coated her tongue. “The whole court will see this for what it is.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t flinch. “They will see what they wish to see. You do not have to help them sharpen the knives.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed then, a small, brittle sound.</p><p> </p><p>“I am to leave <em>tomorrow</em>, Jen,” she whispered. “Tomorrow, I will walk out of this house and into hers, at the side of a woman I scarcely know and cannot read. I am to leave you. Leave everything I know. And I could not even manage a single day here without driving her away early. What am I to do there.”</p><p> </p><p>Her throat closed around the last syllable. The corridor wavered again.</p><p> </p><p>Jen stepped forward and caught her hand, gripping it tight. “You did not drive her away.”</p><p> </p><p>“You do not know that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know you,” Jen said. “And I know you are very good at deciding you have failed before anyone has had the chance to speak.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth pulled into something that might have been a smile in better light. “A useful skill. It spares one the surprise.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s fingers tightened around hers. “It is a cruel one. And you do not deserve it. Not from them, and not from yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>A maid edged past with a smaller chest, keeping her gaze fixed firmly on the floor. Agatha and Jen both fell silent until the woman had gone, the sound of her footsteps fading toward the stair.</p><p> </p><p>“This feels like punishment,” Agatha murmured at last, barely moving her lips. “Sent away early like a misbehaving child.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then you will just have to make certain they remember you are not a child,” Jen said. “You are a consort. A queen’s chosen. Let them choke on that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Chosen,” Agatha echoed, the word strange in her mouth. Her eyes dropped back to the trunk. “It does not feel like choosing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Feelings lie,” Jen said quietly. “Coin does not. Nor does a crown.” She drew a breath. “Do you want me to stay? Help you sort what they’re throwing into these boxes?”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, the offer wavered in front of Agatha like a lifeline. She could almost see it: the two of them on the floor, sleeves rolled, Jen swearing at misfolded gowns while they pretended this was any other journey. Any other leaving.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed it back.</p><p> </p><p>“If you stay, your mother will come hunting,” Agatha said. “And then we will have to deal with the wrath of two mothers in these halls.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s mouth twisted. “I suppose the one good thing about this is your mother cannot touch you once you are gone.”</p><p> </p><p>“That,” Agatha said, “depends very much on how long her reach proves to be.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen huffed, impatient. “You deflect like a councillor already.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am adapting to my surroundings.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “Fine. But I will be back before nightfall. If they forget to pack your good boots, I shall stage a revolt.”</p><p> </p><p>“Spare the servants,” Agatha said. “They are only doing as they were told.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s gaze softened. “And you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I will do as I am told as well,” Agatha replied. “For now.”</p><p> </p><p>Something like pride flickered across Jen’s face. She stepped in, squeezed Agatha’s hand once more and, before anyone could think to object, leaned up to press a quick kiss to her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“I will see you later,” she said. “Do not let them strip you down to nothing before then.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have nothing they have not already tried to take,” Agatha said, but she said it lightly, as if it were a jest and not a confession.</p><p> </p><p>Jen gave her a look that said she heard the truth anyway, then turned and walked away down the corridor, her steps crisp, back straight. A moment later, the corner swallowed her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood where she was for a few breaths longer, listening to the low shuffle and murmur all around her, the soft thud of trunks closing over pieces of the life she knew. Then she drew herself up, smoothed her skirts, and stepped into her half emptied chamber.</p><p> </p><p>The servants parted for her as if she were a blade.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>Agatha did not go down to luncheon.</p><p> </p><p>By the time the bells marked the midday watch, most of the trunks were closed, their wax seals cooling. Only a few plain dresses and a travel cloak still hung from the open wardrobe. The rest of her life had been tucked away behind polished wood and leather straps.</p><p> </p><p>Someone knocked, knuckles soft against the door. One of the castle’s senior maids bobbed a curtsey in the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>“My lady? The table is laid. Her Majesty has taken her place.” A carefully neutral pause. “She wishes to know if you will be joining.”</p><p> </p><p>The thought of walking back into that room, sitting opposite the queen again after everything that had occurred—with her chest still aching and her mother’s words still ringing—it made her tongue feel like lead in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“My stomach is unsettled,” Agatha said. “Give Her Majesty my apologies. I would not wish to offend her with poor company.”</p><p> </p><p>The maid hesitated, then dipped her head. “I will say you are unwell.”</p><p> </p><p>She withdrew. Agatha listened to her footsteps fade and only then let herself breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Not long after, a tray appeared on the low table by the window. The tray carried bread, a bowl of broth still faintly steaming, a cup of pale tea that smelled faintly of mint and some sharper herb. There was more on it than she was used to when she hid herself away like this—an extra heel of bread, a little dish of salted butter, a slice of some pale cheese.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps on of the senior stewards had decided a fainting consort would be bad for appearances. Or perhaps the servants were simply overdoing it, unsure what was expected of a queen’s wife.</p><p> </p><p>She stared at it for a long moment, jaw tight, then turned back to the trunk she had been pretending to sort.</p><p> </p><p>By the time the broth had gone cold and a thin skin had formed across it, she rang for the maid and asked that the tray be taken away.</p><p> </p><p>“I am not hungry,” she said, though her head was beginning to ache and her stomach ached with more than emptiness.</p><p> </p><p>The afternoon thinned around her. Light crawled across the bare patches of wall where shelves and hooks had once hung. She worked mechanically, checking lists, smoothing folded fabric, pretending she had any say in what stayed and what went.</p><p> </p><p>True to her word, Jen slipped back in before the evening bells.</p><p> </p><p>She did not stay long—only enough time to scold a footman for trying to pack Agatha’s battered boots, to re-fold a stack of chemises with more care than any servant dared, to sit for a moment on the edge of the bed and rest her head briefly against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother’s voice floated down the corridor once, sharp as a whipcrack. Jen pulled away with a grimace.</p><p> </p><p>“I have to go,” she whispered. “If I am late to table my own mother will flay me. Again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Go,” Agatha said. “I will be fine here in my lonesome.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen huffed a soft laugh, then sobered. “Send for me if you cannot sleep.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, though she knew she would not.</p><p> </p><p>When Jen left for the second time, the chamber felt emptier than it had all day.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She did not go to supper either.</p><p> </p><p>Another knock. Another maid at her door, this one more hesitant than the last. “My lady… Her Majesty is in the great hall. Your place has been laid.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat at the edge of the bed, hair unbound, fingers worrying at the embroidered hem of her sleeve.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell them I am still unwell,” she said. “I would only dampen the mood.”</p><p> </p><p>The maid hesitated. “Shall I stay? Fetch the healer?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly. “No, that will not be necessary.”</p><p> </p><p>The maid retreated. Eventually, a second tray appeared—supper this time, lighter but laid out with the same anxious generosity as before. Another bowl of broth, a small cutlet of something cooled under its glaze, more bread than one person needed, the same pale tea whose scent warmed the room.</p><p> </p><p>She did not touch this one either.</p><p> </p><p>By the time the sounds of supper had faded—the muffled rise and fall of voices, a faint drift of music, the echo of chairs and cutlery—the room no longer looked like hers at all. Only the bed remained dressed as it had been the night before, and even that felt like something borrowed.</p><p> </p><p>She washed at the basin, changed into her nightdress, and climbed beneath the covers as if the act itself might hold the day at bay.</p><p> </p><p>The canopy above had never seemed so low.</p><p> </p><p>On the wall opposite, a pale outline marked the place where a small shelf had hung for years. Her crooked wooden bird, the one she had carved with a smuggled knife under Jen’s supervision, lay now in some padded corner of a trunk, anonymous among folded linen.</p><p> </p><p>Tomorrow, all of it would go. Out of this house, out of this city, across the River to a court she had never seen, where strangers would look at her and see only the price paid and the mark on her chest.</p><p> </p><p>The bond hummed low and stubborn beneath her ribs, as if aware of the direction her thoughts had taken, as if leaning already toward the woman who had ordered her departure and, apparently, her meals.</p><p> </p><p>“I will not go crawling,” she said into the dark. There was no one to hear it. “You may drag me, but I will not beg to be kept.”</p><p> </p><p>Fear crept in when she lay still too long. Not the sharp panic of the riverbank, but a heavier thing, slow and cold. Fear of being alone among new mouths and old rumours. Of sitting across from that unreadable gaze day after day, never knowing whether the hand extended toward her would shield or strike.</p><p> </p><p><em>You survived this house,</em> something in her reminded her. <em>You survived your mother. You survived being unwanted where you were meant to belong most.</em></p><p> </p><p>She turned onto her side, drawing her knees up, one hand fisting in the sheet.</p><p> </p><p>She had learned, here, how to bend without breaking. How to make herself small when she had to, and sharp when she could not. The queen’s court would be no gentler. But it would be different. New walls. New rules. New cracks to slip through.</p><p> </p><p>And she was not entering it empty-handed. She bore a title now, whether she felt fit for it or not. Wife. Consort. Problem, perhaps—but one that now came with a crown’s seal.</p><p> </p><p>“They will not make a fool of you,” she told the dark. “Not there. Not again.”</p><p> </p><p>Whether she meant her mother, the court, or the queen herself, she did not say.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, the wind worried at the shutters. Somewhere in the house, a guard’s step passed, measured and distant. Beneath her palm, the mark on her chest warmed faintly, as if answering some thought she refused to let to the surface.</p><p> </p><p>“I know who I am,” she whispered, barely stirring the air. “I am not a mistake to be thrown away.”</p><p> </p><p>The saying of it steadied something inside her. The fear did not vanish, but it loosened its grip, leaving room for a thin, stubborn thread of defiance.</p><p> </p><p>She held onto that as her eyes finally closed, in a bed marked for leaving, in a chamber stripped for the journey, on the last night she would ever sleep under her mother’s roof.</p>

<p>Luncheon had been understandable.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had made a mess of breakfast. She had spoken too much where it was uncalled for and had spoken far too little where civility expected it.</p><p> </p><p>She had not intended to offend her. In fact, before that meal the thought that she <em>might</em> have offended her had not crossed her mind.</p><p> </p><p>During their first meal together Agatha had appeared stiff at times, yes. She had been curious, intrigued, almost teasing in a scarily perceptive way. She had not seemed slighted. But perhaps Rio was simply incapable of reading her in the same way the younger woman appeared proficient in reading Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Because as she had sat in the same seat she had that morning, trying her hardest not to stare at the empty chair ahead of her, it was clear she had, in some way, deeply offended her wife. The table had been laid for two again: two settings, two cups, steam curling from dishes that grew steadily cooler. Yet only one had taken their place this time.</p><p> </p><p>The servants had drifted at the edges of the hall, careful in their movements, careful in where they let their eyes fall.</p><p> </p><p><em>“Perhaps she’s simply running late,” </em>she had tried to convince herself. Even as the food grew colder and the silence grew thicker.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was not sure how long she had sat there before it finally dawned on her that Agatha would not be showing up.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually she had beckoned over a servant , attempting to maintain an air of indifference as she asked after her consort’s whereabouts. </p><p> </p><p>“Her Ladyship is unwell, Your Majesty,” She had been told. </p><p> </p><p>She had suspected it was a lie. Deep down. Somewhere traitorous, where a vague awareness had begun to take root—her body tuning itself towards the woman she was now bonded to. What little she could make out did not suggest illness. But something else, something far more complicated than Rio wanted to touch or decipher in that moment.</p><p> </p><p>She had tried not to dwell on it. Tried not to pick it apart and examine it with a similar intensity that she had felt turned on herself that morning. Because if she had, she would have had to admit that she cared. </p><p> </p><p>And caring was not something she could afford at present. </p><p> </p><p>Not here. </p><p>Not with her. </p><p> </p><p>She knew she should have simply gotten up at that moment. Taken her leave. Unconcerned herself in the matter. Put it down to the sensitivities that came with young age and too little summers under one’s belt.</p><p> </p><p>Despite this, she had not been able to simply let it go. </p><p> </p><p>She had ordered a meal to be sent to her consort’s chambers, detailing exactly what was to be brought, in part because she did not trust this court’s opinion of a “hearty” meal. The maid had waited in uneasy silence as Rio specified the milder broth rather than the rich stews, extra bread, a little cheese, mint for the tea instead of the harsher eastern blends.</p><p> </p><p>She had not been entirely sure what constituted a suitable sickbed tray  for a woman she was almost certain was not unwell, but she had tried regardless. And perhaps she had been a little excessive, but was that not better than the alternative?</p><p> </p><p>She had not touched her own meal in the end.</p><p> </p><p>She had left only after confirming a tray would be sent up as she had requested.</p><p> </p><p>And then she had locked herself away in her guest chambers under the false pretence of convening with council from home. Her desk was, in fact, piled with scrolls and parchments detailing aspects of the union she knew she should be turning her mind to. Despite this, her thoughts had circled back, again and again, to the image of azure eyes observing her and truly seeing her in a way she hadn’t felt since—</p><p> </p><p>Well. It was safe to say she had not endured that kind of scrutiny, that kind of <em>knowing</em>, in a very long time.</p><p> </p><p>She had ran a hand through the roots of her hair and had tried to ignore the faint tremor of her fingers. She knew she would have to redo the braid but that had sat near the bottom of an already long list of concerns at the time.</p><p> </p><p>And when a familiar feeling had stirred in her chest, she had tired to pretend she couldn’t feel the thread of guilt bleeding into it.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Dinner had been worse.</p><p> </p><p>It had stripped away any room for pretending.</p><p> </p><p>While Agatha’s absence at lunch had been unsettling her absence at dinner was a cause for concern.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had taken her place at the head of the table in the grand hall. Her entrance was supposed to be the last. Everyone had taken their place by the time she had taken hers.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone bar one.</p><p> </p><p>The seat to the left of Rio had remained empty.</p><p> </p><p>Once again she had tried not to over examine it. Tried not to let her gaze linger on it, not to let a frown set in her brows. She had kept her back straight and her expression unreadable, had put on a show of pretence that nothing was amiss.</p><p> </p><p>The sight had still troubled her.</p><p> </p><p>It had gnawed at something within her. Something that made her very nearly get up and abandon her place in a hall full of eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Of course she had not done that.</p><p> </p><p>It would have ben bad optics. Something they had enough of already. Her consort had refused to dine with her the day after their wedding. Publicly. She knew how it looked. That, she told herself, was what truly bothered her. Not the absence itself, not the image of a young woman sitting alone behind a locked door, but the fact that such a refusal looked…poorly. A sovereign’s wife declining her place at a table so soon after the vows would make or easy whispers if word travelled. It suggested unrest. Weakness. A union already splintering.</p><p> </p><p>That was what bothered her, she had insisted to herself. The repercussions. The appearances.</p><p> </p><p>It might almost have been convincing.</p><p> </p><p>Almost.</p><p> </p><p>But the longer she had remained seated there, with the buzz of hushed chatter, scraping utensils and low music floating around her the more she had strained not to glance to her left, not to imagine her consort’s current state, not to care.</p><p> </p><p>As the meal had gone on, the lie had frayed into a quieter, unbidden thought.</p><p> </p><p>What if she is truly unwell?</p><p> </p><p>The question had sat with her at the desk, on top of the neat piles of parchment. It had slid in again over the cold cuts of meat on her plate that she pushed around with her knife. It had sat with her until, in a moment of frustration she would later excuse as simple pragmatism, she had done something she had been avoiding since the moment the mark had burned across her skin.</p><p> </p><p>She had reached for the bond.</p><p> </p><p>Not merely tolerated its presence. Not merely poked at its outer corners. She had gone looking for it this time. She had shut her eyes briefly and let out a slow breath and turned her awareness inward, toward that faint thread beneath her ribs that was no longer wholly her own.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment there had been nothing, and she could have almost laughed at herself for indulging such foolishness.</p><p> </p><p>And then something had answered. Not in words. Not in anything so clear as pain. Merely a tightening—like a hand closing somewhere in the hollow of her chest, like a curtain drawn shut over a window. Something there and not there all at once.</p><p> </p><p>It had frustrated her. The ambiguity.</p><p> </p><p>It had not been like calling upon the other currents she knew. The old ache and heaviness she had long since learned to brace against. This was quieter. As if she stood at the edge of a riverbank in the fog, the sound of the water there but dimmed, its shape hard to make out.</p><p> </p><p>She had followed it all the same.</p><p> </p><p>The thread had pulled tighter, the fog drawing back, still distorted but a little easier to make out.</p><p> </p><p>It did not feel like fever. It did not feel like the dull weight of sickness. It was something else. Closed. Coiled inwards. Wrong, her instincts had supplied. Not in the way a body failed, but in the way a wound bleeds with no blood.</p><p> </p><p>She had withdrawn from the thread as if it burned.</p><p> </p><p>It is not illness, she had thought, pressing her thumb hard into the edge of the table until the bone protested.</p><p> </p><p>Which meant whatever kept her consort from her side was something she had no right to touch. Something she had perhaps caused and could not mend with herbs or orders or treaties.</p><p> </p><p>She had told herself, firmly, that she would not reach again.</p><p> </p><p>She had turned her attention back to the great hall.</p><p> </p><p>The chatter had not ceased but Rio had begun to notice something else between the noise.</p><p> </p><p>The looks.</p><p> </p><p>She was no stranger to having eyes on her. That was not what caused her skin to prickle.</p><p> </p><p>The looks were not directed at her but rather to the side of her.</p><p> </p><p>To her left.</p><p> </p><p>To the vacant spot that seemed to command more attention than it would have if it had been occupied.</p><p> </p><p>It would have been fine if it had stopped at the looks.</p><p> </p><p>She could handle stares.</p><p> </p><p>What she could not handle was presumption.</p><p> </p><p>Presumption and disrespect.</p><p> </p><p>Both of which seemed ample in the court she had found herself in.</p><p> </p><p>Because between the stares came the whispers.</p><p> </p><p>Spoken behind careful hands and napkins but spoken all the same.</p><p> </p><p>A particular look between non other than her consort’s mother and one of her ladies at her side, followed by a round of derisive laughter, had irked something inside her.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you care to share what is of such amusement at the dinner table Lady Harkness?” Rio spoke for the first time that evening, her voice steady and her words even.</p><p> </p><p>The lady beside Evanora had the half decency to appear ashamed, though Evanora Harkness met Rio’s eyes with a knowing smirk.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, we were only discussing how unfortunate it is that Her Ladyship is…indisposed,” her voice pitched with feigned innocence and just enough volume to carry to the nearer tables. “What with your departure looming so close, it is a shame, truly, we will not be able to see the two of you together in the glow of your still green marriage. “</p><p> </p><p>Rio did not respond but her eyes narrowed. She had expected whispers of this, of course but to have it come from her mother in law was…grating.</p><p> </p><p>“We had all hoped, of course, that the newlyweds would honour us with their presence a little longer. But perhaps our humble court fatigues Her Majesty more easily than we realised.”</p><p> </p><p>A ripple of laughter moved along the table like an ugly little wave. Rio watched the way eyes slid unashamedly, as if pulled by a string, toward the empty chair at her left and then away again, sharp with interest.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s words seemed to speak an invitation as though others had been waiting for the opportunity to voice their own options as well.</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps the princess simply failed to…commend herself,” someone else had added, softer, cruel amusement tucked beneath the words. “Hard to hold a queen like this, I imagine. Harder still to make her stay.”</p><p> </p><p>The vague feeling in the bond had suddenly made perfect sense. The tight, closed wrongness she had touched earlier was  made clear. It was humiliation anticipated before it could be delivered. A young woman choosing absence rather than sit here while they carved her apart with their tongues.</p><p> </p><p>For a fleeting moment, Rio had been glad that the woman they spoke of was not there to hear their cruelty. And yet she knew, just as surely, that Agatha already understood how her court weighed her. The damage had been done long before Rio’s arrival; this new slight merely gave them sharper knives.</p><p> </p><p>Only then had the full shape of her earlier decision revealed itself. In her own court, such a change of plans would have been met with some murmuring, a raised brow here or there, perhaps a sharply worded letter from a councillor too fond of ceremony. In this place, it was different she had discovered too late. Newlyweds were meant to apparently remain as long as custom demanded. To show themselves, to be seen and appraised and blessed and gossiped over. To leave after a handful of days was not merely inconvenient—it was a slight. A judgement.</p><p> </p><p>She had been too used to her decisions only affecting her own reputation. </p><p>She had failed, entirely, to consider how swiftly this court would lay the blame elsewhere. On the daughter they had given away. On the unseen bride who had not, in their eyes, held her queen’s attention long enough.</p><p> </p><p>The thought sat with her like grit between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>More comments followed, little barbs dressed up in silk. She heard Evanora murmur something about “delicate nerves” and “a sensitive constitution,” the words wrapped in a smile that did not reach the woman’s eyes. She saw the press of lips, the exchanged glances, the way a young lady at the far table hid a smirk behind her hand.</p><p> </p><p>It was not herself they were weighing upon their tongues. It was her consort’s. Her worth. Her failure. Her shame.</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps,” the same minor lord as before ventured, emboldened by wine and his fellows’ laughter, “Her Majesty found the goods of the auction less appealing upon closer inspection than they had appeared at first glance. One can hardly fault a queen for wishing to return to her own halls when—”</p><p> </p><p>“You speak,” Rio said, before he could finish, “with remarkable confidence on matters far beyond your knowing.”</p><p> </p><p>She had not raised her voice, but the hall heard her all the same. Conversation faltered. The lord froze, cup half raised.</p><p> </p><p>Rio set her own goblet down with great care.</p><p> </p><p>“If my visit has been brief,” she went on, every word measured, “it is because affairs of the crown and River do not bend themselves to your supper tales. There are matters that require my presence elsewhere. Matters you would not begin to comprehend, and which I have no intention of wasting breath explaining.”</p><p> </p><p>A murmur, quickly stifled, ran along the nearest benches. The lord’s face had gone the colour of curdled milk.</p><p> </p><p>“As for Her Ladyship,” Rio continued, allowing the slightest edge into the title, “her conduct has been without fault. I would advise you—and any who share your talent for idle speculation—not to mistake my obligations for some lack in the woman who now stands as your queen’s consort. Or in my regard for her.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence had followed, sudden and sharp. Somewhere down the table a chair had scraped, someone shifting as if to relieve an unseen pressure. Agatha’s mother’s smile had faltered by a fraction, the corners drawn a little too tight.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had not looked at her. She kept her gaze on the man who had spoken until he dropped his eyes to his plate and muttered something that might have been an apology.</p><p> </p><p>The moment had passed. Conversation, slowly, resumed its former volume, though the laughter was thinner now, and glances in her direction were several shades more wary.</p><p> </p><p>She had taken  no pride in it. It had not been for her own sake.</p><p> </p><p>She did not, even then, regret her decision to leave. Her queendom did in fact need her. Perhaps she stretched the truth on the severity of the matters that awaited her, but the truth could not be spoken. Not allowed, especially not here. If anything the evening had solidified her decision. She did not want to keep them in this cursed court a day longer than she had to—not after seeing how they regarded the woman they called their princess.</p><p> </p><p>But as the meal had worn on, as dishes were cleared and wine was pored and repoured it hit her that it  was the second time in as many days that she had misjudged the weight of this kingdom’s customs upon its princess. The second time she had failed to account for the way her actions would be read through those archaic, ridiculous expectations—and the second time Agatha had borne the cost of that failure.</p><p> </p><p>She had decided, somewhere between the main course and the honeyed pastries she barely tasted, that there would not be a third.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever this bond between them proved to be—curse, blessing, mistake—she would not go on stumbling through her consort’s world with her eyes half shut, letting every misstep fall on the younger woman’s shoulders.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>Later that night, when the hall had emptied and the torches in the main corridors had been banked low, Rio had asked to see Lady Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>The request could not be refused. Not by someone who valued the benefits of upholding the treaty between them. And Rio suspected that was what Evanora cared for most.</p><p> </p><p>They met in a smaller chamber off the great hall, a room meant for private audiences. A fire smouldered in the hearth; tapestries hung close on the walls to keep the draft at bay. Evanora was already there when Rio entered, seated in a high backed chair as if upon a throne she no longer held, a cup of spiced wine resting on the table at her elbow.</p><p> </p><p>She stood when Rio crossed the threshold, dipping just low enough to be respectful, just shallow enough to remind everyone present—servants, guards, the walls—that she had once been bowed to instead.</p><p> </p><p>“Your Majesty,” she said, with a smile that did not trouble the skin around her eyes. “How may I be of service?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio did not sit at once. She came to stand by the table, letting the silence hold for a heartbeat longer than courtesy required. Her hands were clasped behind her back to keep from bracing on the chair, or from curling into fists.</p><p> </p><p>“There is one matter I wished to settle before we depart,” she said. “It concerns your daughter’s preparations for travel.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s smile sharpened.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” she said lightly, as if tasting the name for flaws. “Yes, of course. Her trunks are already prepared, Your Majesty. We laid out her finest gowns for the celebrations. You will find she is suitably attired.”</p><p> </p><p>For feasts in these halls, Rio almost said. Instead, she inclined her head a fraction.</p><p> </p><p>“For the <em>road</em>,” she replied. “We depart at first light. The journey will not be a short one. I wish to ensure Her Ladyship has what she requires.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s hand fluttered, a little dismissive wave.</p><p> </p><p>“The carriage will keep her comfortable,” she said. “She will have cushions, blankets. What more could the girl need?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s jaw ticked. “I speak of more than cushions.”</p><p> </p><p>She let the words come out mild. It cost her.</p><p> </p><p>“Has she boots fit for riding?” Rio asked. “Not embroidered slippers. Leather, thick enough for long miles. Soles that will hold on wet stone.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause, slight but telling. Evanora’s fingers tightened on the stem of her cup before relaxing again.</p><p> </p><p>“My daughter is not accustomed to… tramping about like a village girl,” she said, smile returning with a brittle edge. “Her place has always been here. At court. We have not had much call to fit her for such…endeavours.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not even for visits to the border holdings?” Rio kept her tone even. “To the coastal estates? She has never ridden out with the hunts?”</p><p> </p><p>“A princess does not need to go chasing deer to understand her realm,” Evanora said. “Besides, Agatha has always been… delicate. Travel unsettles her. She prefers familiar surroundings. Mirrors and <em>books</em> and such.” She took a sip of wine. “If she is unused to hardship, it is by her own preference.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio very much doubted that, but she chose not to voice it as she didn’t trust herself to speak for a moment without saying something regrettable. The ease with which Evanora had spoken stoked something hot and dark in Rio’s chest. As if keeping a child penned in stone and silk were a quirk of temperament. As if a woman could now choose where to stand when every door was barred and every path was watched.</p><p> </p><p>“She is no longer simply a princess,” Rio said carefully at last. “She is the queen’s consort now, and with that comes many new endeavours. She will not be hunting on this journey. She will, however, be crossing mountains and open country. Carriages break axles. Roads wash out. In my experience, weather does not always heed a noble’s nerves.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am certain your escorts are capable,” Evanora replied. “They will see to it she does not have to set a foot in the mud. Agatha is used to—” she tilted her head, as if searching for a kind word and finding none—“plenty. A little discomfort now and then will not harm her. Might even do her good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio thought of the way the bond had tightened earlier with hurt that had nothing to do with wounds and blood. Of the way those same lips had curled hours earlier while the hall laughed at the absence of the woman they were discussing.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers shifted against her back. She did not let them close.</p><p> </p><p>“And for the cold?” she asked. “What cloaks has she?”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora brightened, as if they had finally found a topic she could enjoy.</p><p> </p><p>“She has a splendid new mantle in deep blue,” she said. “The embroidery took three months. There is another of black velvet, trimmed with sable. Very striking. She cuts a fine figure in both, I assure you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Velvet will drink every drop of rain it sees,” Rio said. “And drag at her shoulders until she can hardly stand. I speak of a cloak that keeps the wet out. Wool. Waxed leather at the shoulders. A hood she can pull close against the wind.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora blinked, as if Rio had begun discussing the habits of pigs.</p><p> </p><p>“We are not sending her to live in a barn, Your Majesty,” she said, a touch of offence creeping in at last. “You speak as if the roads between here and your capital are nothing but mire. Surely your people maintain them better than that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will remind you there is a long journey between this capital and my own,” Rio said, voice dangerously soft.   “My people maintain what they can, but you should know there are roads that I cannot account for, as they do not fall within the bounds of my territories.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora simply stared at her with an almost bored expression and Rio felt the anger rising within her bones. How could this woman be so blithe about her only daughter embarking on a potentially dangerous journey?</p><p> </p><p>“Besides, the River floods when it wishes. Rain falls when it wishes. The wind does not care for embroidery.”</p><p> </p><p>The bond tugged again, towards somewhere not too far from them— to its other half behind some locked door, perhaps pacing, perhaps curled small and lying awake restless. Rio could not tell. She only knew that every careless word in this room seemed to scrape against that same raw place where the bond lay.</p><p> </p><p>“Has she ever left this city?” Rio asked. “Truly left it. Not to the next estate over for an afternoon. Has she ever slept a night beyond these walls?”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora hesitated, then gave a little shrug.</p><p> </p><p>“Once or twice, when she was younger,” she said. “Children are tiresome. They grow restless if you keep them in one place. We outgrew that phase. She settled. The court is where she belongs.”</p><p> </p><p>Settled. As if her daughter were a spilled drink mopped up, a stain scrubbed into obedience.</p><p> </p><p>Rio imagined a girl with eyes like the clear heart of a flame, pressed into brocade and veil and told to still herself until even her laughter seemed an affront. Imagined her watching carriage wheels roll away, over and over, with other people in them.</p><p> </p><p>“You did not think she might one day need to know how to bear a journey?” Rio asked. “To endure a change of air without struggle?”</p><p> </p><p>“If she has such trouble, I am sure you will manage her,” Evanora said. “You seem very capable, Your Majesty.” Her smile thinned. “In any case, she is your concern now. That was the agreement. We have provided what was asked.”</p><p> </p><p>We have provided what was asked. A kingdom and a girl, tied together on an auction block. Gowns for a wedding. No boots for escape.</p><p> </p><p>Something old and sharp rose in Rio’s chest at that—an urge to bare her teeth, to flash her eyes, to send everyone in this room scattering like startled birds. She pressed it down. She was not in her own halls. She could not afford to let the wrong thing show.</p><p> </p><p>“My concern,” she repeated, and the words tasted truer than she liked.</p><p> </p><p>She drew a breath deep enough to steady the line of her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“You are right,” she had said. “Your daughter is under my protection now. My concern. And since your court has not found cause to see to her needs beyond your own walls, I will have your workrooms attend her before dawn.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s eyebrows lifted, faintly affronted.</p><p> </p><p>“There is no need to trouble yourself so, Your Majesty,” she said. “We are quite capable of outfitting a princess. If we had been told earlier—”</p><p> </p><p>“You have had her entire life to prepare her for the world beyond these stones,” Rio said, not unkindly. “You chose not to. I do not intend to compound that error.”</p><p> </p><p>Colour rose, high and sharp, along Evanora’s cheekbones.</p><p> </p><p>“She is… sensitive,” she said. “Particular about everything, she will probably complain about the fabric feeling wrong against her skin. There is no use wasting good people’s time on that girl.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio thought of the younger woman who had stood before her and spoken her mind with little fear of consequence when Rio had misstepped. The woman who looked at her that morning and spoke what she saw. Sensitive, they called her. Rio saw something else.</p><p> </p><p>Someone who had been forced into a certain box, whom people looked at but only saw the outer corners of. Someone who had been clearly denied basic care by those who were meant cherish her the most.</p><p> </p><p>Rio could not continue that. She would not.</p><p> </p><p>“She will not be your concern much longer,” Rio spoke at last. “Nor will her so called fussing.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s smile sharpened. “No. As I said, she is yours now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then we understand one another,” Rio replied. “No one will lay a hand on her tonight. Your tailors have dressed her since childhood; they know her form well enough to cut cloth without pulling her from her bed.</p><p> </p><p>She let that sit for a heartbeat, then added, “Have them summoned to my chambers within the quarter hour.”</p><p> </p><p>“At this hour?” Evanora’s brows climbed. “You expect my workrooms to magic you a new wardrobe before dawn, Your Majesty?”</p><p> </p><p>“I expect them to answer when their queen calls,” Rio said, voice calm. “Which is what I am now is it not?”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s eyes narrowed at that. Rio kept her own gaze levelled and light. Women like Evanora could not unsettle her.</p><p> </p><p>“I will give them the patterns I require,” Rio said. “Something suited to the road, in my colours, bearing my crest. The rest can be settled when I see what your craftsmen can manage.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora stared at her for a moment, a flicker of understanding there. “You mean to dress her like one of your own, then.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio met her gaze without blinking. “She is one of my own now.”</p><p> </p><p>The colour that had seeped into Evanora’s cheeks deepened at that. “Very well,” she said. “I will send word to the workrooms.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do that,” Rio said. “I will speak to them myself. I would not have the details…mislaid in passing.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>They arrived quicker than expected, if she were to be honest.</p><p> </p><p>Either Evanora truly did value the treaty more than she let on, or her household had simply learned long ago to run when called.</p><p> </p><p>A knock sounded at her chamber door—three polite raps, not the brisk rhythm of a guard. Rio set aside the parchment she had not been reading and called for them to enter.</p><p> </p><p>Two tailors stepped in, a man and a woman, both middle aged, both in work stained wool with measuring cords looped about their necks. Behind them came a younger leatherworker, his apron smelling faintly of oil and dye, and a maid struggling under the weight of a neatly folded gown over one arm and a ledger tucked against her hip.</p><p> </p><p>They bowed—lower than Evanora had—and hovered just inside the door as if uncertain how far they were permitted to come.</p><p> </p><p>“Your Majesty,” the woman said. Her voice was steady, but Rio could see the tension in the tight line of her shoulders. “Her Grace said you required our services this night.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” Rio said. “Come in. Close the door behind you.”</p><p> </p><p>The younger maid nudged the leatherworker with her elbow; he turned and pushed the door shut, the latch catching with a quiet click. The chamber felt smaller for the number of bodies in it, firelight casting shadows against walls. Even then, that newly familiar presence tugged faintly along the bond—muted, turned inwards, but there. It sat under Rio’s breastbone like a folded hand.</p><p> </p><p>She ignored it, or tried to.</p><p> </p><p>“You have been told we depart at first light,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” The woman swallowed. “We were informed the princess—that is, Her Ladyship—lacks certain… articles you deem necessary for the road.”</p><p> </p><p>“That I deem necessary if the road refuses to behave,” Rio corrected, but without heat. She gestured toward the small table near the hearth. “Lay that gown there.”</p><p> </p><p>The maid obeyed at once. The gown spilled across the wood in a careful tumble of fabric. Rio recognised the cut now, high at the throat, tight at the ribs, sleeves that went entirely to waste beneath the heavy ceremonial overgowns. Beautiful. Useless.</p><p> </p><p>“The measurements?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>The male tailor stepped forward with the ledger, holding it as if it were a holy text. “We brought her latest,” he said. “Taken for the wedding garments. There has been no time for her to change much since, save perhaps—” He cut himself off, as if aware he had strayed too near a line.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took the ledger from him. Lines of ink marched neatly down the page: height, shoulder width, waist, hip, arm. Someone had annotated the notes with the occasional practical comment—<em>prefers looser sleeve; complains of seams</em>—and Rio felt a brief, irrational flicker of gratitude toward whichever seamstress had bothered to note what the girl liked rather than simply forcing cloth upon her.</p><p> </p><p>“She has not been easy to dress, I gather,” Rio said mildly, eyes on the page.</p><p> </p><p>The woman tailor winced. “She has… opinions, Your Majesty.”</p><p> </p><p>Good, Rio thought. Let her keep them.</p><p> </p><p>Aloud, she only said, “Her opinions will not be offended by what I ask of you tonight. I require very little, but it must be right. A travelling cloak and an under-layer suited to the road. A pair of boots that will not cripple her by noon. Simple, practical. No trailing hems, no velvet. She will be seated in a carriage <em>if all goes as it should</em>—but if it does not, she may have to ride or walk. She will need to be able to move.”</p><p> </p><p>The leatherworker shifted his weight, nervous but alert. “Your lands, Majesty?” he asked. “I have never seen them, but I have heard—”</p><p> </p><p>“Temperate,” Rio said. “The worst you will be dressing her against is rain, river mist, and long days. The air cools quickly once the sun drops. Roads can turn slick after a single shower. I do not want her shivering in soaked brocade because someone thought embroidery more important than sense.”</p><p> </p><p>He nodded, gaze going distant in the way of a man already sketching patterns in his mind.</p><p> </p><p>“And colours, Majesty?” the woman asked. “Her Highness usually wears—”</p><p> </p><p>“I appreciate what she usually wears,” Rio said, looking up from the ledger. “But for this, I want my colours worked in. Deep green, river-blue, silver. Not gaudy—this is not a court mantle. A clasp at the throat bearing my crest, and another—small—at the shoulder. Nothing that shouts at every traveller on the road, but enough that anyone who knows how to look will understand whose protection she rides under.”</p><p> </p><p>They exchanged glances at that, quick and sharp. They were not fools. They knew what Rio was asking of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Your Majesty,” the man said slowly, “her existing gowns bear her family’s sigils. If we alter—”</p><p> </p><p>“You will not touch those,” Rio said at once. “This will be new work. If cloth is scarce, speak with the stores; if you are refused, send the keeper to me. I will pay what is needed.” She shut the ledger with a quiet thud. “I am not here to erase her past. I am ensuring she is not soaked to the skin at the first change in weather.”</p><p> </p><p>The words had come out sharper than she intended. The tailors flinched, then straightened, recognising what lay beneath the tone if not its source.</p><p> </p><p>“You will have your cloak, Your Majesty,” the woman said. “And boots.”</p><p> </p><p>“In her correct size of course,” the leatherworker added.</p><p> </p><p>Rio inclined her head. “Good.”</p><p> </p><p>She hesitated then, glancing once toward the adjoining wall as if she might see through it. “I hear she has never travelled far,” she found herself saying, more to the room than to the people in it. “Not properly. Think of a girl who has spent her life in corridors and courtyards and is now to see her first long road from a jolting seat when you are crafting your pieces.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman’s expression softened, just for an instant. “Aye, Majesty,” she murmured. “We understand.”</p><p> </p><p>“And…” Rio paused, weighing the line between necessity and indulgence, between what she could admit to herself and what she could not. “Make the cloak light enough not to smother her in the sun, but with a lining that sits soft on the skin. No coarse seams at the neck or under the arms. If she is to be bounced along for the duration of the journey, I would rather she not arrive rubbed raw because no one thought past the first mile.”</p><p> </p><p>That was, she told herself, simple pragmatism. A consort distracted by discomfort tired faster, complained sooner, made for slower travel and poorer spirits among the escort.</p><p> </p><p>“You will not have time for anything ornate,” she added, letting practicalities settle over the moment. “And I am not asking you for it. A clean cut will do. Sturdy stitching. You have the night. If you require extra hands, take them. Do you believe you can get this done?”</p><p> </p><p>The man swallowed. “This is… much, Majesty. But not impossible.”</p><p> </p><p>“That is good,” Rio replied. “Because it must be done.”</p><p> </p><p>“And payment, Majesty?” the leatherworker asked, almost apologetically. “We will use better materials if you wish her truly dry and steady footed. Her Grace is… careful with such matters.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have no doubt,” Rio said dryly. “My steward will see you given what you need. If he hesitates, tell him I ordered it. If your wages are docked for any of this, you will send word to my capital and I will see the shortfall repaid twice over. I will not have you punished for doing what I asked you to do.”</p><p> </p><p>It was that, more than the promise of coin, that seemed to ease something in their faces. Work was one thing; the threat of a disgruntled patron afterwards was another.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Majesty,” the woman said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded once, brisk. “Go. Work. Wake who you must. Remember, you are not making finery for a feast. You are outfitting the queen’s consort for a road that does not always do as it is told. Treat it with the seriousness you would any important order, and all will be well.”</p><p> </p><p>They bowed again, even lower this time, and began to gather their things. The maid refolded the gown with reverent hands, as if loath to leave it exposed to smoke and drafts. At the door, the leatherworker hesitated and glanced back.</p><p> </p><p>“Your Majesty,” he ventured, “I have always liked her Ladyship. It is good to see she will be going someplace …better than this.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio did not respond to that. She did not trust herself to. She gave another curt nod instead which was reciprocated before the door was shut lightly leaving her alone once again in a room that was not truly her own.</p><p> </p><p>“This is politics,” she told herself, under her breath, as she moved to snuff two of the candles. “Optics. A consort arriving in tattered pieces reflects poorly on a sovereign. A consort drenched and blistered reflects worse.”</p><p> </p><p>But when she lay down later, cloak and boots already halfway to being brought into existence for a woman who did not yet know they were coming, it was not treaties or appearances she thought of as sleep crept up on her.</p><p> </p><p>It was the thought that this may be the first time in that woman’s life that she would be presented with something made not to display her, but to carry her safely forward. And that thought caused something to ache within her as she eventually drifted to sleep.</p>

<p>Agatha awoke before the sun.</p><p> </p><p>She did not rise with haste. She lay very still, in the same bed she had laid in since she had outgrown a cot, and let the knowledge of it sit on her chest like stone.</p><p> </p><p>This would be the last morning she woke here.</p><p> </p><p>By nightfall she would be far along the road to another land. Another castle. Another court. Another bed.</p><p> </p><p>To a place where she knew no one at all, save the woman who would be taking her there.</p><p> </p><p>The woman who had bought her hand in marriage in exchange for a throne.</p><p> </p><p>The woman who organised their departure without so much as a word of warning.</p><p> </p><p>And the same woman who the River had seen fit to tie her soul to in a cruel, cosmic jest.</p><p> </p><p>She stared at the empty wall to her side and felt that torturous tug in her chest once again. It seemed to have a nack for making itself known at the least desirable moments. She turned her face into the pillow until it faded into something bearable.</p><p> </p><p><em>You will not swallow me,</em> she thought, and she did not know whether she addressed the bond, the woman, or the life ahead. <em>Not as this place tried to do.</em></p><p> </p><p>Whatever waited for her at the end of this road, she would not let it silence her. Not as they had done here. If she had to live on pure spite alone, then so be it. Spite had sharper teeth than hope.</p><p> </p><p>With that promise in mind she breathed in the scent of her sheets one final time before pulling them back away from her body. The cool morning air hit her in an instant. It had that particular chill that belonged to the hour before sunrise, damp and thin, nosing under her nightdress as she stood. She rubbed her arms and looked around her chamber, really looked, the way one might look at a body prepared for burial.</p><p> </p><p>It was bare in a way she had never seen it.</p><p> </p><p>The dressing table was stripped of its clutter. Only the faint ghost rings remained, pale on the polished wood, marked where pots of kohl and combs and trinkets had once stood. The few books she had gathered over the years, snuck behind her mother’s back, often with the help of Jen, were gone—hopefully all carefully boxed by servants and not thrown out. The rug beside her bed, worn soft in one spot where her bare feet had landed every morning, looked suddenly lonely, already half-forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed to the window and laid her fingers on the stone where she always rested her elbow to look down into the gardens. The stone was cool, its familiar roughness catching against her skin. Soon, no one would stand there again in such a way.</p><p> </p><p>“Good riddance,” she murmured to the emptiness, but the words did not quite ring true.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps it was the small part of her that had always hoped this place would become more than a place of residence and less like a prison.</p><p> </p><p>Her palm drifted from the sill to the wall, tracing the places where tapestries had hung, where shelves had been, where her life had taken up space. A little inventory of absence. <em>Here</em> the hooks where her cloaks had hung. <em>Here</em> the peg that had always caught the hem of her gown if she turned too sharply. <em>Here</em> the corner where she had sat with a book in her lap and dreamt of anywhere but here—and now “anywhere” had become “there,” and there was little comfort in it.</p><p> </p><p>When there was nothing left to touch, nowhere left for her fingers to land that did not feel stripped and cold, she drew a steadying breath and crossed to the inner door.</p><p> </p><p>Her chamber opened into a small sitting room, a luxury granted when she had come of age where she had outgrown the confines of her bedchamber but her mother did not want her wandering around—or perhaps she had simply not wanted her around herself. It had always been the warmest part of her rooms with cushions strewn, books hidden in various nooks and crannies and a shawl or two draped over the back of a chair.</p><p> </p><p>Now it was as bare as the bedchamber.</p><p> </p><p>Well. Almost.</p><p> </p><p>On the centre table and couch, a set of items had been carefully placed with almost ceremonial precision.</p><p> </p><p>She paused in her step before inching closer in curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>On the table lay a pair of leather gloves. They looked costly from sight alone, though not in the way she’d grown used to her mother’s possessions appearing costly. The leather was fine, the cut neat, warm enough to ward off a chill yet stylish in a way that suggested quiet prestige. Beside them lay a folded underdress. Draped over one side of the couch was a deep forest green tunic-dress, simple yet well cut.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes trailed to the other side of the sofa where a darker green cloak hung.</p><p> </p><p>And at the foot of the couch, set squarely together on the rug, a pair of boots.</p><p> </p><p>Not the dainty, heeled things her mother favoured for court. These appeared built to last with dark leather burnished to a soft sheen, soles thick and ridged for grip, the stitching small and sure along the seams. There was a little extra padding at the ankle, she noticed as she peered closer, where the leather might otherwise rub.</p><p> </p><p>For a ridiculous moment, she glanced back towards her bedchamber, half expecting to see her mother lurking in the doorway with a disapproving purse of her lips.</p><p> </p><p>But Evanora Harkness would never have commissioned such things. There was too much sense in them. Too little pride.</p><p> </p><p>She reached out and let her fingers brush the cloak first. The material was smooth but weighty, the kind that might shrug off rain for a time. On the clasp a small sigil had been engraved, matching a second, larger one on the shoulder stitched in dark thread, subtle enough in colour that it was barely noticeable in the dimness.</p><p> </p><p>Her family’s crest was a serpent wound around a burning branch.</p><p> </p><p>This was something else entirely.</p><p> </p><p>She took the cloak up in both hands and pulled it closer, heart beginning to beat harder despite herself.</p><p> </p><p>There, sewn with care, was the queen’s mark. A dark oval meant to be a river stone, its centre stitched with faint, flowing lines like current. Around it, a ring of thorned vines had been worked in finer thread, their tiny barbs forming a jagged crown.</p><p> </p><p>Placed strategically where no one with eyes could fail to see it when the clasp lay at her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes drifted to the other items laid out. The boots bore the same emblem pressed into the leather at the outer heel. The tunic had it worked, discreet and careful, at the collar.</p><p> </p><p>Her mind supplied the possible answers, sharp and quick, each one cutting at a different angle.</p><p> </p><p>A brand. A sign to every eye between here and the border that she belonged now to the Vidal throne. Property marked and owned.</p><p> </p><p>A warning, perhaps, to those who liked to touch what did not belong to them that <em>touch this and you answer to me.</em></p><p> </p><p>Or less likely, and therefore most dangerous to consider. A thought spared for a girl who owned nothing fit for the journey she was about to embark.</p><p> </p><p>An act of care.</p><p> </p><p>Her throat tightened. She set the cloak down as if it might burn her.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever it was, whatever intention had guided the queen’s hand when she had given the order for these things to be made, Agatha would not soften herself around it. She would not stand in this stripped room and imagine gentleness where there might be only ownership.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers lingered, unwillingly, on the padding at the ankle of one boot. It would keep the leather from chafing. Someone had thought of that. Of blisters and bruises.</p><p> </p><p>She snatched her hand back.</p><p> </p><p>Entertaining that line of thought was foolish. She could deal with ownership. She had dealt with it all her life.</p><p> </p><p>What she was less versed in was kindness.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The courtyard below bustled with movement.</p><p> </p><p>From the top of the broad front steps, Agatha stood in her new cloak and boots and watched servants dart between carts and horses, their arms full of trunks and bundled cloth, the breath of the animals steaming faintly in the thin morning light. The air was full of the thud of footsteps, the clatter of metals and wood and the low calls of stablehands and guards.</p><p> </p><p>At the centre of it all waited the queen’s carriage</p><p> </p><p>Well, carriage was an understatement for the beast that stood before them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had never seen anything like it before. Four dark carriage stood nose to nose to tail, their frames far heavier than of those she’d seen others ride in growing up. The wheels were branded with iron, the wood glossed and well kept. Each door bore the river stone crest on its side, painted in muted colours that still managed to catch the eye. The glass appeared tinted, so dark she could barely make out a thing inside from where she stood. Rows of tall, dark horses stood in front, prepared to pull its full weight.</p><p> </p><p>Behind the carriage, a line of covered wagons sagged under the weight of luggage and supplies, and riders were already mounted at the head and tail of the column, the queen’s colours and crest hanging in narrow banners from their spears.</p><p> </p><p>It looked less like a royal convoy and. More like a small, moving fortress.</p><p> </p><p>She could feel the queen beside her, even without looking at her. The feeling of eyes glancing over at her periodically being a big giveaway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her own gaze fixed forward.</p><p> </p><p>They had exchanged pleasantries when they first arrived. A brief, polite good morning. That had been enough. Since then she was trying her hardest to avoid eye contact until absolutely necessary. She’d rather not look at her other woman wearing a suspiciously similar cloak to her own and wonder about what exact message she was trying to put out.</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, there had been no formal breakfast that morning. She would not have been able to avoid another meal and the last thing she needed was to make a fool of herself at another breakfast right before being entrapped with nth other woman for what was to be a long, torturous journey.</p><p> </p><p>They had sent up another tray instead while she dressed. It had looked far closer to the sort of meal she was accustomed to than the laden spread from the previous day. Simple. Manageable.</p><p> </p><p>She knew she should have tried to eat as much as possible before the journey but she had only managed three small spoonfuls of oats before her stomach had twisted and closed like a fist. She had gone longer without food before she told herself as she tried to ignore the voice in her head that reminded her just how many days it had been since she had last eaten a proper meal.</p><p> </p><p>Below, a herald stepped forward and lifted his staff. His voice rang out across the courtyard, announcing Her Majesty of the Riverlands and Her Grace the Consort, naming the journey, blessing the road in the River’s name. People bowed. Guards thumped spear butts against stone. Somewhere, faintly, a bell chimed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s spine stayed straight. Her hands were steady at her sides. She did not look at the queen.</p><p> </p><p>When the formalities were done, they began their descent.</p><p> </p><p>The steps felt longer than they ever had before. Each one took her farther from the rooms she had grew up in, from the life she had known. At the base, the first of the linked carriages awaited, its door open, a guard standing ready to close it as soon as they were inside.</p><p> </p><p>They had taken no more than three steps towards it when a voice cried her name.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p> </p><p>The sound pierced through her like an arrow she barely had time to urn before something small and solid collided with her front.</p><p> </p><p>Arms wrapped tight around her waist. The impact drove a short, startled breath from her lungs. For a heartbeat she stiffened, then her body recognised the shape and weight of the embrace and she folded down without thinking, her own arms coming up to clutch the girl who had thrown herself at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Jen,” she breathed, the word cracking on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>She felt, rather than saw, the queen go stiff beside her. The slight shift of weight. The way the air changed briefly, growing colder and heavier. Out of the corner of her eye she almost caught the brief twitch of a hand towards the hilt at the queen’s hip before it stilled.</p><p> </p><p>But Jen was crying into the front of her cloak, and that tore her attention back.</p><p> </p><p>“I tried to come sooner,” Jen said in a rush, her words muffled. “My mother held me back, she thought it would be better to let you go without a fuss. As if I could ever do such a thing.” She pulled back use enough for Agatha to see her face, eyes bright and wet. “You’ll write to me, wont you? Promise me you’ll write? I’ll die of boredom here if you don’t.” She tried to pass it off as a light joke but Agatha flet the undercurrent of her words. <em>I need to know you are safe and alive.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s own throat had closed too tight for speech. She managed a nod, fingers digging into the fabric at Jen’s shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted very much to say <em>you are the only thing I shall miss about this place</em>. She wanted to say <em>don’t let me go. Please dont let me go. </em>She wanted, absurdly to grab her hand and run away like they had always whispered about in the quiet of the night.</p><p> </p><p>But her legs remained rotted to the ground and when she opened her mouth, nothing came.</p><p> </p><p>Jen seemed to read the struggle there, because she gave a watery little laugh and hugged her again, hard.</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” she said, as if Agatha had answered. “Good. Then I’ll be fine.“ She leaned back in, her nose brushing against the edge of Agatha’s ear the next part. “Do not let them make you small. Remember you are still Agatha, my best friend no matter what your last name or title is. You are the strongest and bravest person I have ever known. Don’t you dare forget that. And do not let them forget either. Remember you are never truly alone, I will always be there for you, no matter the distance between us.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been a sob.</p><p> </p><p>“Lady Kale.” Her mother’s voice cut across the courtyard like a knife.</p><p> </p><p>Jen flinched. Agatha felt her grip tighten, rebellious for a heartbeat longer, before duty—or fear—won out. Evanora stood at the foot of the steps, composed as ever, her hand resting lightly on the rail. Her gaze on Jen was cool enough to freeze a stream.</p><p> </p><p>“That is quite enough,” she said. “Her Ladyship must go. You are making a spectacle.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen pulled back reluctantly, scrubbing at her cheeks with the heel of her hand. She gave Agatha one last, desperate look.</p><p> </p><p>“We will meet again,” she whispered. “I swear it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded again because she still did not trust her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s fingers closed around Jen’s arm, apparently tired of the display. She drew the girl back towards the e step, dismissing the scene with a sight turn of her hand. To everyone else it looked like a brief interruption of proceedings.</p><p> </p><p>To Agatha the moment, it felt like the last thread being cut.</p><p> </p><p>“Your Grace.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s voice drew her attention back to her surroundings. Agatha realised she was standing half turned towards the steps, fingers still curled in the air as if Jen’s sleeve were there.</p><p> </p><p>She smoothed her hand down the front of her cloak and forced her feet to move.</p><p> </p><p>The carriage door was still open. The queen stood beside it, a gloved hand raised in invitation.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, pride alone kept her still. She did not need help to climb a single step. She did not need the queen’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>Then she felt the eyes on her. The court’s her mother’s. The queen’s. Refusing that hand, here would be as much of a scene as Jen’s embrace had bee. More, perhaps.</p><p> </p><p>She placed her fingers in the queen’s.</p><p> </p><p>The grip that closed around hers was firm but warm. It steadied her in that brief moment when one foot left the ground and the world tilted. She stepped up into the carriage and released the hand at once, taking her seat beside the window as the queen followed her in.</p><p> </p><p>The door shut behind them with a solid, final sound. More of the queen’s people loaded into the carriages behind them. A guard’s voice finally called an order. Outside, wheels creaked, harness jingled, the shout travelled down the line. The carriage lurched as the horses leaned into their traces and the whole train began to move.</p><p> </p><p>Agathas gaze turned to the window as if pulled.</p><p> </p><p>Through the thick glass she saw the courtyard slide past. Servants thinning away into doorways. Guards peeling off to take their places along the column. Her mother standing at the bottom of the steps, hands folded, expression as smooth and unreadable as ever.</p><p> </p><p>Beside her, Jen bounced on her toes, waving wildly  as if she might somehow bridge the growing distance with sheer determination. Agatha lifted her own hand, pressing her palm to the glass rather than raising it, unable to bring herself to wave back and make it real.</p><p> </p><p>The castle she had grown up in, with its stone and towers and narrow windows, began to shrink as they rolled towards the gates. The walls she had walked every day of her life slid past, then the gates, then the outer town with its roofs and streets and smoke.</p><p> </p><p>Soon they would be beyond even that. Out on the open road, between one life and the next.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched until the last glimpse of the familiar walls was gone, until all that remained in the window was the pale strip of sky and the line of the road running forward into an uncertain distance.</p><p> </p><p>Then, very slowly, she drew her hand back from the glass.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They sat there in silence as the first stretch of the journey unfolded, neither speaking a word nor paring a glance at the other.</p><p> </p><p>The carriage rocked and jolted around them, filling the small compartment with the steady rattle of wheels on and the thud of hooves.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat with her back to the cushioned seat, hands folded in her lap, gaze fixed stubbornly on the window. The world outside lurched past in narrow strips. The last crooked houses of the outer town, then fields lined with low stone walls and trees with burnt leaves reaching up against a pale sky.</p><p> </p><p>Across from her, the queen sat with the same poise Agatha had begun to recognise. She did not fill the space in the way she would have expected someone of her legacy to. Something that still caught Agatha off guard. There was no looming, no theatrical enact. Only a controlled stillness, and the faintest sense of pressure.</p><p> </p><p>The bond coiled between them, quiet but stubborn. If Agatha allowed her mind to drift too close to the edges of it, she could feel the queen’s presence there—a steady pulse, distant and infuriatingly unreadable.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her attention on the glass until her own reflection blurred with the landscape.</p><p> </p><p>They rode like that for some time before the queen spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“The girl who embraced you,” she said. Her voice low and unhurried.. “On the steps.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s spine tightened.</p><p> </p><p>She did not turn fully, but her eyes shifted from the window to the woman in front of her, sharp and wary. “What of her?”</p><p> </p><p>“Is she a friend?” The queen asked.</p><p> </p><p>The question was simple enough. It should have been harmless. Still, something in Agatha bristled.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” she said, the word clipped. “She is my friend.”</p><p> </p><p>A beat. The queen’s gaze did not move from her face.</p><p> </p><p>“My only one,” Agatha added, before she could stop herself. It slipped out sideways, bitterer than she had meant it to sound. “If that satisfies Your Majesty’s curiosity.”</p><p> </p><p>One of the queen’s brows twitched, almost a flinch.</p><p> </p><p>“I did not mean to pry,” she said. “You seemed… close. I thought you might miss her.”</p><p> </p><p>The gentleness of it—if it was gentleness—made Agatha’s shoulders knot rather than ease. She turned fully now, facing the queen instead of the window, studying her as if looking for the catch.</p><p> </p><p>“You thought,” she repeated.</p><p> </p><p>The queen held her look without flinching. “She cares for you,” she said. “Anyone with eyes could see that. It is no small thing to lose such a person, even for a time.”</p><p> </p><p>Heat pricked at the backs of Agatha’s eyes. She looked away quickly, out towards the fields, jaw tight.</p><p> </p><p>“I will manage,” she said. “As I am expected.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence settled again, thicker this time.</p><p> </p><p>The carriage swayed. Somewhere ahead, a rider called to another; the sound came muffled through wood and leather. Agatha could feel the queen watching her still. Not staring, exactly, but present. Attentive.</p><p> </p><p>It set her teeth on edge.</p><p> </p><p>After a while, she turned back, anger sparking up through the sadness like dry tinder catching.</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you asking me these things?” she demanded. “About Jen. Whether I will miss her.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s expression did not change, but something in her gaze faltered. “Because she seems to matter to you,” she said. “And because you are leaving her behind on my account. It seemed… courteous to acknowledge that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You do not have to sit there and pretend to care.” The words came out hotter than she had planned. “You have done what you came for. You have your throne. You need not pass the time by playing at concern.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s lips parted, then closed again. For a moment, she looked almost at a loss.</p><p> </p><p>“I am not—”</p><p> </p><p>“I do not understand you,” Agatha pressed on, the floodgates open now. The ache of farewell, the stripped room, the River’s cruel binding, all of it shoved itself into her throat at once. “I do not know what you want from me. One moment you behave as if you are…” she groped for the word, hated it, used it anyway, “…as if you are <em>concerned</em>. The next you make decisions that tear me from my home weeks before acceptable in the eyes of the court, without so much as a word.”</p><p> </p><p>Her hands had curled tightly in her lap. She forced them to uncurl, to lie flat, to look graceful and unbothered. Her voice failed to follow suit.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want from me?” Agatha demanded, leaning forward now, unable to keep her seat as straight and still as the queen’s. “Just tell me. Tell me now, and I will do it, and we may both have some semblance of peace.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s gaze dipped, briefly, to her hands, then back to her face. “I do not—”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want,” Agatha cut across her, “a quiet, obedient wife to stand at your side and look pretty while you rule?”</p><p> </p><p>The carriage seemed to grow smaller around them. The air between them thinned.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you wish us to pretend at love,” she went on, “so the courts may sigh and say what a fortunate match it is, how romantic, how blessed.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice dropped without her willing it to, the words slipping out softer, edged with something darker. She shifted forward on the seat, closing some of the space between them, eyes never leaving the queen’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me in your bed,” she asked, each word deliberate, “to warm your sheets after a long day? To ease your temper. To satisfy your desires. To make you feel powerful in your own chambers?”</p><p> </p><p>The queen went very, very still.</p><p> </p><p>For a heartbeat, the only sound was the rattle of the wheels and the faint jangle of harness. The bond surged, a sharp, startled flare beneath Agatha’s ribs that was not hers.</p><p> </p><p>“That is <em>enough</em>,” the queen said.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice had not risen, but there was a cutting edge to it now that had not been there before. The kind of edge that would have made men twice her size think twice about pushing her further.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved, humourless. If she were about to be murdered  for insolence she may as well clear her mind.</p><p> </p><p>“Then what do you want?” she asked, frustration spiking. “Because I can be all of those things, if that is what you require. I have been raised for little else. But I would rather know now than keep guessing in the dark.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen stared at her as if she had spoken a language no one had warned her she might ever hear.</p><p> </p><p>“I do not want you for any of those things,” she said at last.</p><p> </p><p>The words lay between them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, a sharp bitter sound. “No? Then what did you enter this arrangement for exactly? You have yet to make that clear, at least to me that is.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s jaw tightened, for a moment it felt like she was no longer looking at Agatha but something else. Then it cleared and a sharpness replaced it.</p><p> </p><p>“I did not enter this mariage under the grounds of love,” she said slowly, each word chosen with care, “or other…frivolous feelings.” Her mouth pressed thin over the phrase. “It was an act of duty. To my realm. To yours. Nothing more.”</p><p> </p><p>The admission did little to settle the confusion weighing heavier on Agatha’s mind by the day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head and folded her arms across her chest before she spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“You paid quite a high price for ‘nothing more’, Your Majesty,” she said. The title came out like a blade.</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s jaw worked once, twice. Something dangerous flickered in her eyes then—controlled, but cracking at the edges. For a moment Agatha thought she might snap back, or call for the driver to halt and have her thrown bodily from the carriage for her insolence.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, the queen only looked at her. The carriage swayed; the world outside went on sliding past. Inside, the silence stretched taut.</p><p> </p><p>The bond pulsed, restless, as if unsettled by the words they had thrown into the narrow space.</p><p> </p><p>At last, the queen drew in a slow breath and let it out again.</p><p> </p><p>“You are right,” she said, and the simple admission startled Agatha almost more than anything that had come before. “About one thing, at least.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted, sceptical despite herself.</p><p> </p><p>“I did not,” the queen went on, “take into proper account what advancing our departure would cost you. I considered threats. Weather. The temper of my own council. I did not think of…” She paused, the barest crease appearing between her brows. “Of you. Of what it would mean to be dragged away sooner from the only home you have ever known. Of how your people might perceive it.”</p><p> </p><p>She glanced down, briefly, at her own hands, then back up.</p><p> </p><p>“For that, I apologise,” she said. The words were plain, without flourish. “It was thoughtless. I am unused to my decisions bearing so much personal weight on another’s reputation and feelings. You do not deserve that and I will try to do better.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had not realised she was holding her breath until it left her in a small, uneven rush.</p><p> </p><p>She had expected denial. Justification. A lecture on politics and safety and how little her feelings weighed against a throne.</p><p> </p><p>Not this.</p><p> </p><p>Suspicion rushed in to fill the space where her anger had been. “Words are easy, Your Majesty,” she said, but the bite was dulled. “Especially on the road.”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps,” the queen allowed. “Still. You asked what I want of you.” She straightened, shoulders squaring as if bracing for some sort of blow. “The truth is, I expect nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “Nothing,” she echoed, flat.</p><p> </p><p>“You owe me nothing beyond the vows you have already spoken,” the queen said. “When we reach my court, you will have your own chambers, your own time. You may go where you please within the palace and grounds, keep what company you choose. No one will cage you or demand that you… perform affection for my sake.” Her mouth twisted, self-mocking. “If you wish to ignore me entirely outside of public duty, you will find me… unbothered.”</p><p> </p><p>It was said lightly, almost dry, but there was a strain under it that Agatha’s ear, tuned to such things, did not miss.</p><p> </p><p>“This is not captivity, Agatha,” she added, more quietly. “However it may feel now.”</p><p> </p><p>Her name on the queen’s tongue sent a strange shiver along her spine. She looked away, down at her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“And your friend,” the queen continued, as if the admission had opened a door she might as well walk through, “need not be lost to you. If you wish to write, my riders can carry your letters faster than any common post. We can have messages travel regularly between my court and this one.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment she could only stare, the words lodging somewhere behind her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>“Your… riders,” she said slowly.</p><p> </p><p>“They ride the river roads,” the queen said. “They change horses at crown posts. It is simple enough to add a pouch of letters to their loads. If you wish.”</p><p> </p><p>There was no grandness to the offer. No demand for gratitude. It was presented in the same tone she might have used to discuss the state of the road ahead.</p><p> </p><p>All the same, it landed with the weight of something far larger.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt suddenly, acutely aware of the carriage walls. Of the woman opposite her, who could lead armies with a word and had jut offered to lend her couriers to a single girl’s correspondance.</p><p> </p><p>Her first instinct was to recoil from it. Kindness had teeth in her experience; it masked expectation, or worse. It was simpler to live with ownership. Cleaner. Easier to understand. It was also becoming harder to grip onto.</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” she asked, before she could swallow it. The word came out smaller than she liked.</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s gaze held hers.</p><p> </p><p>“Because she matters to you,” she repeated, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “And because I am the reason you are leaving her behind.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down quickly, unable to bear the weight of that steady look for more than a heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she said, the words stiff and unfamiliar on her tongue. They tasted like surrender and salt.</p><p> </p><p>She was not foolish enough to lower her guard over a promise of letters or a pair of boots. But as the carriage rolled on and the landscape unfurled before them, some small, treacherous part of her filed the offer away alongside the padded leather and odd compliments of her hair.</p><p> </p><p>Ownership she understood. She had been controlled and paraded like a doll her life long before she had been bought and bartered.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever this was, this awkward apology and thoughtful promises… she did not yet have a name for it.</p><p> </p><p>And that, more than anything, unsettled her.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The silence returned after that.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat there digesting the queen’s words. Twisting and turning them around in her head. Attempting to peel back the layers to discover whatever hidden blade must surely be waiting beneath.</p><p> </p><p><em>I will try to do better.</em></p><p><em>You owe me nothing.</em></p><p><em>This is not captivity.</em></p><p><em>Because she matters to you.</em></p><p> </p><p>Eventually she had to concede that perhaps, just perhaps, she had been wrong.</p><p> </p><p>Not entirely. Not enough to loosen her grip on caution. But enough to admit that the woman before her was not quite the neat, simple threat Agatha had plainte in her mind. That perhaps her acts of genuineness were just that—genuine.</p><p> </p><p>She allowed herself to consider I the possibility.</p><p> </p><p>She would not allow herself to accept it.</p><p> </p><p>Accepting it meant lowering her guard. She could not afford that. Not yet.</p><p> </p><p>So she sat and thought instead. She walked herself back through every encounter, every exchange. Occasionally, she risked a glance at the woman opposite her.</p><p> </p><p>The queen had not moved much since their exchange. She still sat straight and composed, her own cloak falling in clean lines  though good posture had been drilled into her bones as brutally as it had been to Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Some part of the facade though had slipped.</p><p> </p><p>The air of calm around her had receded to the point Agatha began to suspect it had been feigned from the beginning. A slight frown had made itself home between her brows and her fingers thrummed against her thigh periodically as though she were deep in thought.</p><p> </p><p>It struck Agatha suddenly that they were to be stuck in this small carriage for the near foreseeable future. Together. It coud prove to be the most excruciating experience of her life.</p><p> </p><p>Or—she could make use of it.</p><p> </p><p>The queens fortified walls were lowered the smallest hairline crack but it was enough. Cracks would widen after all. Perhaps this was her only chance, trapped as they both were, to learn something of the woman beyond tales and title. It might help her decide if those apologies and offers were anything but smoke. At the very least, it might give her some sense of the place she was being carried towards.</p><p> </p><p>She drew a breath, smoothed her face into something curious and almost mild, and broke the silence herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me,” she said, “about your queendom.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s fingers stilled. She looked up, faintly wary, as if expecting another accusation hidden in the words.</p><p> </p><p>“You have asked me this before,” she said, a single brow raised in question.</p><p> </p><p>“I was not satisfied by your answers.” Agatha replied with a slight shrug.</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s gaze narrowed. “You speak…rather bravely at times.”</p><p> </p><p>“Should I be afraid, Your Majesty?”</p><p> </p><p>Th queen did not answer immediately. She folded her arms and leaned back eyes remaining on Agatha’s the entire time.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said at last, carefully. “I suppose not.” A small pause. “Ask your questions. I shall try my best to answer…to your satisfaction.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, studying her.</p><p> </p><p>“What is your favourite place within it?” She asked. “Where do you go when you are not…ruling.”</p><p> </p><p>The corner of the queen’s mouth twitched, almost a grimace. “A queen is seldom not ruling.”</p><p> </p><p>“So i have heard,” Agatha said. “Yet I imagine even you must, at some point, draw breath. Where do you prefer to do so?”</p><p> </p><p>“There is a bend in the River just outside the castle walls,”she said slowly.  “A little way upstream. The banks are rock there, not mud. The water runs fast enough to keep itself clear. In summer the spray cools the air, and in winter the mist hangs low. It is… quiet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her as she spoke. The frown between her brows eased, very slightly, as if the memory smoothed something.</p><p> </p><p>“And you go there alone?” she pressed.</p><p> </p><p>Something flickered in the queens eyes before it was quickly smothered.</p><p> </p><p>“You could say so.” She supplied after a beat.</p><p> </p><p>“Would it be untrue?” Agatha pressed further.</p><p> </p><p>The queen was silent for a while, when she spoke again, her gaze had gone faintly distant, as though she wasn’t truly seeing Agatha at all.</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose I mean,” she said at last, “it often feels as though I am never truly alone.”</p><p> </p><p>The words hung there. She did not elaborate.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waited, but no explanation followed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the weight of a dozen possibilities—old ghosts, old sins, the weight of a metaphorical crown that never left her brow.</p><p> </p><p>She filed it away with the rest.</p><p> </p><p>“And what do you like most about your lands?” she asked next.</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s shoulders squared a little; she seemed to shift back into safer territory.</p><p> </p><p>“The River,” she said, without hesitation. “It gives us our trade, our harvests, our—”</p><p> </p><p>“I know what the River gives your people,” Agatha interrupted, gentle but insistent. “What does it give <em>you</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>The queen blinked, as if unused to being separated from the lands she ruled.</p><p> </p><p>“It is…” She searched for a word, then let out a breath. “Constant,” she said at last. “It has been there longer than any throne. It will be there when I am gone. It does not care for crowns or councils. I find that… grounding.”</p><p> </p><p>Grounding. A strange word from the mouth of a woman whose name was more feared than the River’s floods.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, as if satisfied, though her mind was already turning it over, weighing it against other things she had seen.</p><p> </p><p>“And the food?” she went on, unrelenting. “What do you think of the cuisine?”</p><p> </p><p>The queen’s brows drew together, not in annoyance but in something like confusion.</p><p> </p><p>“We have many influences,” she began. “River fish, of course, and the trade from the ports, and the—”</p><p> </p><p>“I did not ask what your cooks <em>can</em> prepare,” Agatha said, unable to keep the ghost of a smile from her lips this time. “What do <em>you</em> enjoy?”</p><p> </p><p>For the first time, the queen looked genuinely wrong-footed.</p><p> </p><p>She opened her mouth, then closed it again, fingers resuming their light tap against her thigh.</p><p> </p><p>“I—” She stopped, exhaled through her nose as if she had just faced down an enemy captain. “There is a stew I have whenever I pass through the outer towns of my queendom,” she said at last. “With beans and smoked meats. It is simple, but it…satisfies.”</p><p> </p><p>“Beans,” Agatha echoed, amused despite herself. “Lady Death, terror of half the realms , felled by a pot of beans.”</p><p> </p><p>Something in the queen stiffened momentarily before she let out a huff. Not quite a laugh, but near enough to count. Agatha briefly wondered what part of her sentence had triggered the reaction.</p><p> </p><p>“I did not claim it was impressive,” she said dryly. “You asked what I liked, not what I would serve to impress visiting dignitaries.”</p><p> </p><p>“And what would you serve to impress them?” Agatha asked at once.</p><p> </p><p>The queen shot her a look, belatedly realising the trap she had walked into.</p><p> </p><p>“Roasts,” she said, sounding resigned. “River trout. Spiced wine. Pastries filled with honey and almond that the capital’s bakers are inordinately proud of.”</p><p> </p><p>“And do you like those?” Agatha pressed. “You, not your bakers.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” She said at last, as though it were some grand admittance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, as if that confirmed something for her.</p><p> </p><p>She kept going. The questions came in a steady trickle, each one small and innocuous on its own.</p><p> </p><p>What season did the queen favour? (Spring, when the ice broke and the River ran wild.) Did she prefer the bustle of the capital or the quiet of the outlying towns? (She preferred the solitude and quiet that came with outlying towns.) Did she ride for pleasure or only for duty? (Both. She had grown up on horseback. Her body did not know how not to move.)</p><p> </p><p>Whenever the queen began to answer in the broad, safe strokes of a ruler—<em>my people, my lands, the court</em>—Agatha would gently, relentlessly steer her back.</p><p> </p><p>“I asked about <em>you</em>,” she would say.</p><p> </p><p>At first, it seemed to fluster the queen more than she would have thought possible. She shifted minutely against the seat, cleared her throat, glanced away as if searching for rescue in the passing hedgerows. Her answers were halting, spare, as though she were pulling them out of some half-forgotten, unused part of herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched. She listened. She filed everything away.</p><p> </p><p>The queen liked dawn better than dusk, it turned out; not for the symbolism, but because the world felt cleaner then, less tangled. She preferred the sound of rain on tile to music played for her at court. She did not admit to it but Agatha suspected she had a secret sweet tooth. She had never cared for falconry, despite her advisers insisting it was fitting for a ruler to be seen with a hawk on her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>“I prefer my hands free,” she said, when Agatha raised a brow at that. “It is difficult to reach for a sword with a bird attached to you.”</p><p> </p><p>There, at least, was a glimpse of the stories Agatha had heard.</p><p> </p><p>As the carriage rocked on, the questions slowed. Not because she had exhausted them—far from it—but because she sensed that pressing further for now might snap whatever fragile thread had allowed the queen to speak this much of herself.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, the road had grown rougher. The steady rhythm of the wheels broke every so often into a harder jolt as they hit a rut or a stone hidden in the dirt.</p><p> </p><p>One such jolt came without warning.</p><p> </p><p>The carriage lurched sharply to one side. Agatha’s hand, resting on the seat beside her, slipped. Her shoulder tipped, balance deserting her with the sudden shift of weight.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could catch herself, a hand closed around her forearm.</p><p> </p><p>The queen had moved without thinking. One moment she sat opposite, safely out of reach; the next her gloved fingers were braced just below Agatha’s elbow, grip firm and anchoring, keeping her from sliding off the cushioned bench.</p><p> </p><p>For a heartbeat, they froze like that.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s other hand flew out, catching at the edge of the seat. Her breath had caught somewhere between chest and throat. The bond flared, sharp and bright, at the point of contact, as if startled awake.</p><p> </p><p>She looked up.</p><p> </p><p>The queen was closer than she had seemed a moment before. The frown between her brows had deepened, not with anger but with sudden, focused concern.</p><p> </p><p>Their gazes locked, held.</p><p> </p><p>For a suspended moment the rattle of the wheels dropped away, the world narrowing to the feel of fingers on her arm and the steady—almost too steady—look in dark eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Then the carriage righted itself. The moment broke.</p><p> </p><p>The queen released her at once, as if she had only just realised she was still holding on.</p><p> </p><p>“My apologies,” she said, retreating a fraction, her voice returning to its usual even timbre. “The road is worse here than I expected.”</p><p> </p><p>She rapped her knuckles against the carriage wall, a signal to the driver to mind the ruts. The familiar air of command settled back over her like a cloak.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat back, smoothing her sleeve where the imprint of that grip still tingled against her skin. Her heartbeat took its time to settle.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she said, because anything else would have sounded like too much.</p><p> </p><p>The queen inclined her head, as if she had merely done something as ordinary as passing a cup.</p><p> </p><p>Silence came again, but it felt different now. Less like a wall. More like a narrow bridge, rickety and frail, stretching between two points that had not, until this road, ever planned to meet.</p>

<p>Chapter End Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Lowkey had more planned for this chapter but I’m so sick of looking at this that I’ll just add it onto the next.</p>
<p>The girls are finally reunited, how do we feel? Hope it was worth the wait. Hopefully I don’t have to write two chapters of zero interaction again for a while because that was lowkey painful.</p>
<p>Also wanted to point out yes I in fact do go back and change certain small details or add on stuff whenever I think of something more interesting sue me. Hopefully I havent confused anyone though I really doubt anyone truly notices besides my brain.</p>
<p>In my head it feels like these previous chapters have been setting up the story and we’re only now entering the parts I’m truly excited for, perhaps because I originally planned all theses chapters to take place in the span of five ish but the story ran away from me entirely but here we are anyways and I’m actually quite happy with how it all turned out.</p>
<p>Anyways thank you all for reading, hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it. I love hearing your thoughts and theories in the comments and you can also find me on twitter @Gibbyish 💜💚</p></blockquote>
