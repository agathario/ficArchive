<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio Vidal, self-made millionaire, is a partier with a bad drug and alcohol habit. She is saddled with custody of her niece Valentina when her brother and his wife pass away unexpectedly. She hasn't spoken to her family for 15 years and wants nothing to do with the 17-year-old on her doorstep.</p>
<p>Agatha Harkness is a struggling single parent to teenage son Nicky. She works two jobs to make ends meet and still always makes time for her son. When he befriends a new girl at school with some behavioral challenges and asks for her help, Agatha lets the girl into her home and picks up Rio's slack caring for her. She doesn't mind being a de facto guardian, but if there's one thing she's determined about, it's to talk (or knock) some sense into Rio Vidal.</p>
<p>Rio is three Negronis in when her phone rings, and she can barely hear it over the pulsing music of the club; barely feel it over the bass pounding in her chest. “Yeah?” she shouts, putting the phone to her ear.</p>
<p>It’s somebody saying she’s inherited a kid. Her niece or something. Yeah, right.</p>
<p>“Okay, good one buddy. Sure, whatever.”</p>
<p>And she hangs up.</p>
<p>Orders another drink.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello fam! I bring you yet another Agathario AU. Please note trigger warnings for graphic drug use and child neglect. (Valentina is 17 and gets her needs met at Nicky and Agatha's house but Rio is still very much neglectful and this could be triggering.)</p>
<p>Please also note the dubcon tag. Some of the interactions between Agatha and Rio are most decidedly dubcon in nature, whether due to Rio's lack of clarity and sobriety or due to her Pavlovian response to Agatha's tie, which Agatha very much uses to her advantage.</p>
<p>If none of that scares you off, please enjoy the ride!</p></blockquote>

      Chapter 1: Rio
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p><em>Rio Vidal, Self-Made Millionaire</em></p><p>That’s what the headlines say about her. That she built her businesses from the ground up, with no help from anyone. It’s true enough.</p><p>Vogue Magazine did a spread on her last month, and she has the article open on her coffee table while she kneels next to it and snorts a line from her own gloss-printed bare stomach.</p><p>She drops the hollowed-out pen shaft and leans back against the sofa, keeping one side of her nose plugged as she sniffs a few times, eyes watering at the burn. “Fuck, that’s good,” she says to the small crowd gathered in her living room, and tips her head to stare at the ceiling.</p><p>She gags a little at the drain, never quite used to it, but the feeling of bliss spreading through her body and crossing the blood-brain barrier erases any irritation.</p><p>“Who’s next?”</p><p>She pays no attention to whichever acquaintance picks up the pen shaft. They’re a dime a dozen, the people who attend her parties. No one is ever very interesting. No one catches her focus. But she’s friendly, because they bring drugs and booze and compliment her house and her clothes and tell her how pretty she is.</p><p>She loves being complimented, and especially loves being told how pretty she is. In fact, if she could, she would make that the only thing other people were allowed to say.</p><p>She gets lost in that fantasy, imagining a world where no one speaks except to compliment her, and a laugh tumbles out.</p><p>The next thing she knows, she’s on her back on the sofa, letting one of the party guests in her panties. It’s nice, if boring, and then she wakes up sprawled face down in the kitchen, sunlight filtering in through the windows to warm the back of her head.</p><p>“Ugh, why am I in the fucking kitchen?” she mutters, her awareness expanding to the puddle of drool her cheek is resting in. “Oh, gross. Come <em>on</em>.”</p><p>She hopes she’s alone. She vaguely recalls kicking everyone out, but has no memory of whether they’d actually left.</p><p>She pushes to her hands and knees, gets to her feet with a groan, and wipes her face on the towel hanging from the refrigerator door. Her head is pounding and she’s out of the good pain pills, so she swipes her best bottle of vodka from the counter and takes a swig.</p><p>Now, to make sure her house is empty.</p><p>It’s not.</p><p>There’s one guy passed out half on the sofa and half on the floor.</p><p>“Hey,” she barks, kicking him in the leg until he stirs. “Hey. Get the fuck out.”</p><p>He falls off the sofa with a thud and scrambles to get up, not even bothering to say anything as he staggers out the door.</p><p>Rio huffs and slams it and locks it. “There better not be anyone else in here!” she yells through the house.</p><p>No response. Good. She can go back to bed.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio is three Negronis in when her phone rings, and she can barely hear it over the pulsing music of the club; barely feel it over the bass pounding in her chest. “Yeah?” she shouts, putting the phone to her ear.</p><p>It’s somebody saying she’s inherited a kid. Her niece or something. Yeah, right.</p><p>“Okay, good one buddy. Sure, whatever.”</p><p>And she hangs up.</p><p>Orders another drink.</p><p>Gets lost in the crowd, dancing with a nameless stranger, expensive perfume strangling her and rough hands on her waist, guiding her through the song.</p><p>She loves nights like this. Expensive dresses clinging to her skin, jewelry dazzling enough to blind in better lighting hanging around her neck and pierced through her ears.</p><p>But nobody knows her in a club like this. She stands out for her taste and beauty, not the words written about her in the latest lifestyle magazine. No one knows her name, and she doesn’t tell. Doesn’t leave with anyone. Doesn’t take anyone with her when she leaves.</p><p>She usually stumbles into her waiting towncar when she’s had enough, and her driver takes her home. Tonight is no different.</p><p>She kicks off her shoes as she enters the house, drops her purse on the entry table, locks the door, and passes out on the couch.</p><p>Her sleep is disturbed by a pounding in her head. She jerks awake and realizes it’s someone knocking on the door. It takes her a few minutes to get up and answer it, and she’s furious as she yanks it open, cursing whoever’s on the other side. “What the fuck do you—”</p><p>It’s a kid. Well, a teenager. And behind her, some guy in a suit.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal? I’m Robert Walker, we spoke on the phone last night.”</p><p>The world is spinning and the contents of her stomach are threatening to emerge. She gags and leans over, holding up a finger to indicate the man should wait a minute.</p><p>The nausea rolls through and passes without incident, and she slowly straightens with a shudder. “I’m not sure who you are, but this is far from funny. My attorney will—”</p><p>“I told you she wouldn’t want me,” the kid interrupts, looking at the suit.</p><p>“Who <em>are</em> you?” Rio asks, leaning a hand on the door frame for support. It’s too damn early for this.</p><p>“Valentina,” the kid says.</p><p>Valentina, Valentina… the name rings a distant bell, but—oh holy Jesus. This is actually her niece. Her brother and his cunt of a wife’s kid. “What the fuck are you doing here? How do you even know where I live?” She hasn’t spoken to any of her family in years. Probably fifteen years.</p><p>“The probate clerk looked up your address,” the suit says. “Could we talk in private for a minute, please?”</p><p>Valentina rolls her eyes and pushes past Rio to go flop on the sofa.</p><p>Rio narrows hers, first at the kid, then at the suit. “If you don’t explain yourself—”</p><p>“Like I said on the phone, Ms. Vidal, her parents left instructions in their will for you to be granted custody of Valentina upon their deaths, and—”</p><p>“What the fuck?” Rio shouts. “Me? Custody of a child? Do I look like I’m about to take custody of a fucking child?” And the other thing registers a second later. “My brother’s dead?”</p><p>“Yes, Ms. Vidal, and you have my condolences. Valentina is seventeen, she will only need to stay with you legally until her eighteenth birthday, and then the two of you can decide what to do from there. She’s been enrolled in the local high school and starts tomorrow. Her possessions will be arriving later today. I hope everything works out.”</p><p>He nods and turns to leave, and she frantically grabs the back of his collar, stepping out onto the porch. “You can’t leave her here!” she hisses.</p><p>He makes a surprised sort of noise and extracts his collar from her fist, brushes his hands on his pants and walks quickly away without looking back.</p><p>“Oh my God,” she says, turning to go back in the house. Her life is fucking ruined.</p><p>She goes straight up the stairs to her bedroom, pops a sleeping pill, and is dead to the world in less than twenty minutes.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio wakes up in the afternoon, groggy and grumpy from having her morning disturbed, and wanders down the stairs, hoping her niece found other arrangements while she slept.</p><p>No such luck. The girl is still slouched on her sofa, eyes glued to the screen of her cell phone.</p><p>When she hears Rio on the stairs, she looks up and points at the coffee table. “Are those drugs?”</p><p>Rio opts out of answering that, continuing past her toward the kitchen. “I’m just going to pretend you aren’t here,” she says, and opens the refrigerator.</p><p>“Cool. Then you won’t mind if I take a few of these hundreds,” Valentina says.</p><p>“I honestly don’t care what you do,” Rio responds carelessly, searching for something to eat that won’t curdle her stomach.</p><p>There’s nothing, so she goes back to the living room and fishes her phone from her purse on the entry table, and orders a salad. When she puts it away, her niece is staring at her.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Did you just order food?”</p><p>“I ordered a salad. Why do you care?”</p><p>“Because I’m hungry?” Valentina says, eyebrows raised.</p><p>“You just took a few hundred dollars off my coffee table. Buy yourself something to eat.”</p><p>“My mom was right about you,” the kid says, shaking her head.</p><p>The hair on the back of Rio’s neck stands up and a chill seeps into her bones. “What the fuck did you just say?” Her voice is low. Angry. Offended.</p><p>Valentina gets up. Stands in her space. “I said, my mom was right about you, <em>Auntie</em> Rio. All the money in the world can’t buy you class. You’re nothing but a junkie whore.”</p><p>Rio wobbles on her feet a little when balance becomes an issue, and squints at her niece. “Your mother—”</p><p>“Is dead!” Valentina screams. “And you don’t give a god damn fuck! I don’t want to be here any more than you want me here! I fucking hate you!”</p><p>Rio stands there with a finger ready to point at the kid, but she’s too slow, and Valentina storms out the door. She slams it so loud it kickstarts the headache Rio thought she would’ve woken up with.</p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In which we meet Agatha and Nicky. Nicky befriends Valentina. Rio mistakes Agatha for a stripper and Agatha discovers Rio's humiliation kink.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Mom?”</p><p>Agatha Harkness glances at the kitchen table as she slops peanut butter onto bread in a hurry. “Yeah?”</p><p>Nicky has that look on his face that means he wants her help with something and he doesn’t know if she’s going to agree to it.</p><p>“There’s this new girl at my school, and she’s only been there three days and she’s gotten sent home every single day, even before lunch,” he starts, his tone inflecting upward at the end so she knows he’s not finished.</p><p>“Mhmm…?” She slops jelly on the other piece of bread and folds them together, using one hand to hold the sandwich and the other to open a drawer for a baggie since she hadn’t planned ahead and had one out already.</p><p>“And, well… I feel really bad for her because her parents died and she got shipped off here to live with her aunt Rio, and—”</p><p>“Rio Vidal?” Agatha interrupts.</p><p>“Yeah, from the magazines,” Nicky says. “And—”</p><p>“Oh God,” Agatha says, grimacing.</p><p>“Yeah, I know,” Nicky says.</p><p>Rio Vidal’s exploits are well known among anyone business minded or anyone who reads Cosmo. She’s always got a drink in her hand in photos, and her eyes never quite match the situations she’s photographed in. Agatha remembers seeing her picture and thinking she was hot, but hot mess was more like it.</p><p>“And she just pretends like Valentina isn’t even there, and mom, she <em>cried</em> about her parents yesterday before she set a fire in the girls’ bathroom so she could get sent home, and I just, I thought maybe…”</p><p>Agatha puts the sandwich into the baggie and zips the closure, then walks over to the table and kisses her son on the top of his perfect head. “Sure baby. Invite her over.”</p><p>He heaves the biggest sigh of relief, and Agatha is struck once again at what an amazing young man he’s turned into. Always thinking of others and trying to help anyone that needs it. “Is that sandwich for me?” he asks after a second, eyeing the bag in her hand suspiciously.</p><p>“You hate peanut butter and jelly,” Agatha says. “Your lunch is in the fridge, complete with turkey sandwich, carrots and ranch, a bag of chips and a soda. Because we ran out of water bottles and I haven’t had time to get to the store.”</p><p>“I can go to the store if you give me money,” he offers, skulking over to the fridge to grab his lunch just as they hear a horn outside.</p><p>“Thanks hon, but I’ll go today,” Agatha promises. “Just enjoy your soda.”</p><p>“Oh believe me, I will.”</p><p>She could’ve filled up an empty bottle with water from the tap, but she likes to spoil him every once in a while. He deserves it. “Have a good day baby, I love you,” she says as he heads out to the bus.</p><p>“Love you too!” he says, shutting the door behind him, and she watches out the window as he walks across the lawn and jumps up onto the bus when the doors open.</p><p>Time for job number one.</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha gets home well after eight o’clock, but she’s got pizza with her as an apology for having to work late. “Hey baby I hope you’re hungry!” she calls, slipping off her shoes by the door and heading for the kitchen.</p><p>She stops short when she sees Nicky and presumably Valentina on the sofa playing some horrifically violent video game. He’s got his headset on and she’s got his spare one, so Agatha realizes drastic measures must be taken. She creeps to the kitchen and sets the box down on the counter, takes out one piece of pizza, and creeps back to the living room, holding the pizza as close to Nicky as possible without touching him until he smells it and rips off his headset, jumping up and spinning around.</p><p>“Mom!” he shrieks. “What the heck!”</p><p>The girl notices and takes off her headset as well, and stands up quickly. “I can go now if—”</p><p>“There’s pizza,” Agatha interrupts before Valentina can conclude she’s not welcome to stay. “Just cheese I’m afraid, because pepperoni is too spicy for my delicate son.”</p><p>“Mooooom.”</p><p>Valentina smiles and nods her head. “Thank you Mrs. Harkness, are you sure it’s okay?”</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, but you can call me Agatha, and yes, I’m sure. Nicky told me your name is Valentina?”</p><p>“He calls me Vee. You can call me that too if you want,” she says, shoving her hands in her pockets and rocking on the balls of her feet.</p><p>“Vee,” Agatha says with a grin. “I like it. Okay go eat before it gets cold,” she then says to them both.</p><p>They shuffle off into the kitchen and she follows a minute later, flopping into a chair with her rogue piece of pizza, not caring about manners or plates or napkins, taking a bite and chewing with a moan of appreciation.</p><p>“Mom, oh my God,” Nicky says, his face beet red.</p><p>Valentina snickers and nudges him. “Shut up, she’s cool.”</p><p>“See?” Agatha says, nodding toward Valentina. “Vee says I’m cool. Shut up.”</p><p>Nicky groans and shoves half a slice into his mouth, chomping noisily.</p><p>“I can’t believe Rio Vidal is your aunt,” Agatha says when she finishes her slice and gets up to go grab another.</p><p>“She is the worst human,” Valentina says. “You know her?”</p><p>“I’ve seen her photo in magazines,” Agatha says. “I know of her. I’m sorry you got shipped off to live with her. Are you… is it livable there?”</p><p>“I took some of her drug money and bought a lock for the bedroom I found for myself because she has parties all hours of the night, and she doesn’t keep any food in the house, she orders out and doesn’t get me anything, the coffee table is like… the ABCs of pharmaceutical nightmarism, she takes sleeping pills and doesn’t wake up to take me to school so I have to take a cab, but I have a room that I claimed and she hasn’t gotten rid of any of my stuff, and there’s a functioning bathroom in the room I picked, so… I guess the answer is… halfway?”</p><p>Agatha’s blood runs cold as she listens, and then it heats to boiling. She drops her second piece of pizza back into the box and folds her hands in front of her to keep them from shaking. “I’m going to need her address,” she says as calmly as she can muster for the kids’ benefit. “You two stay here.”</p><p>Valentina’s eyes go wide, and Agatha can see the excitement behind them. “Are you gonna pop off?”</p><p>“Oh, I am going to pop off,” Agatha says, flexing her fingers. She’s already heading for the door. “Nicky, text me the address. Don’t wait up.”</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha loosens her tie because she feels like it’s strangling her, and wishes she’d changed into something more comfortable for this confrontation, but oh well, live and learn. She cracks her neck as she walks up the driveway and to the front door, knocking sharply.</p><p>She can hear music from inside the house, a commotion, and then the door swings inward to reveal the hot mess that is Rio Vidal.</p><p>Big brown eyes with dilated pupils rake up and down her body, wicked tongue pressed to Rio’s cheek before she turns and yells over her shoulder into the house, “Who ordered a stripper?” Before she can say or do anything, Rio turns back around and grabs her by the tie, dragging her into the house. “I don’t care who ordered you, actually, you’re mine first.”</p><p>She’s seething with anger, but realizes it’s probably the best opportunity to get Rio alone, so when she’s pulled toward the living room, she whispers hotly, “Uh-uh, sugar. One at a time. Take me to a bedroom.”</p><p>Rio veers off in another direction, wrapping the tie around her hand once to hold it tighter. “I like you already. You’re the most interesting person I’ve met all night.” Her words are slow and some of them slurred.</p><p>Agatha might be pissed off, but she’s only human, and Rio is goddamn fucking hot and literally dragging her through the house, and she’s wet by the time they end up in an opulent guest room with the door shut.</p><p>“Funny you should say that, because you’re not very interesting at all,” Agatha says in her sultry stripper voice, slipping her tie over her head and laying a hand on Rio’s chest, shoving her backward onto the bed.</p><p>Rio lands on her elbows, a pout gracing her flawless face, the tie still clutched in one hand. “That’s not very nice,” she says, eyelids fluttering.</p><p>Agatha paints on a condescending grin and leans forward to tap Rio on the nose. “Well now, <em>you’re</em> not very nice, are you?”</p><p>“I’ll give you an extra grand to stop talking,” Rio slurs, bouncing her fancy heels against the bed frame and widening her knees so Agatha can almost see under her dress.</p><p>Fuck, she’s weak for a woman’s pussy… she didn’t anticipate having to fight these particular urges tonight. Time to end this. She stands between Rio’s knees and bends over, hands flanking bare shoulders, and looks into those glassy brown eyes. “You’re pathetic,” she hisses quietly.</p><p>The outrage she anticipates doesn’t come. In fact, Rio’s mouth falls open with a gasp, and she shifts on the bed beneath Agatha.</p><p>Oh. <em>Oh</em>. Rio <em>liked</em> that. Oh, fuck. Might as well double down and say what she came here to say, even if it’s not exactly the way she pictured saying it. “You disgust me,” she continues, a sneer on her face now. “Sitting here in your mansion, snorting in one day what good working people would spend on food for a month. You’re like a fucking disease, infecting everyone around you.”</p><p>Rio’s head tips back and her breathing kicks up. “What kind of stripper are you?” she asks in awe.</p><p>“The kind that knows a waste of space when she sees one,” Agatha says. “That’s what you are, isn’t it, Rio? A drug-addled waste of fucking space.”</p><p>Agatha can see the muscles in her throat constrict as she swallows hard.</p><p>And then Rio nods. She fucking <em>nods</em>.</p><p>What is Agatha supposed to do with that? Now she’s not only angry, she’s so turned on that her clit is aching. But this is not happening. It’s just not.</p><p>“I bet you’re about to come in your panties, hearing the truth that no one else will tell you. How pathetic you are. Spread out for a lowly stripper you tried to pay literal hush money, flushed and panting, desperate for it. So fucking wet you’ll have to hire someone to change the sheets because you probably don’t know how to do it yourself.”</p><p>Rio whimpers, and Agatha has to get out of here before this train derails any further.</p><p>“Please.” It’s quiet. And yes, it’s desperate.</p><p>“You couldn’t pay me enough to touch a self-centered slut like you,” Agatha bites out, and before she can do something she’ll truly regret, she stands up and walks out the door.</p><p>Rio doesn’t follow, and she’s back in her car in about forty-five seconds, heart in her throat, pulse roaring in her ears, and she slams her hands on the steering wheel repeatedly. “FUCK!”</p><p>--</p><p>She hopes the kids are asleep when she gets home, but it’s not that late so she probably won’t be so lucky.</p><p>Not lucky at all… they’re both pulling open the front door before she even reaches it.</p><p>“What happened?” Nicky asks.</p><p>“Did you tell her off?” Valentina adds. “Hit her maybe?”</p><p>“I told her off, I didn’t hit her,” Agatha says, stepping into the house and slipping off her shoes. She hangs up her keys and drops her purse, and she’s angry and annoyed and hungry.</p><p>“What did she say?”</p><p>Ffffff. “Not much, I’m afraid. I think she was too high to really understand the situation.”</p><p>Valentina grunts. “Yeah. That tracks.”</p><p>“Where’s your tie?” Nicky asks.</p><p>Agatha slaps a hand over her chest where the tie should be, and as she remembers where it is, she prays her panic doesn’t show on her face. “Oh, I took it off in the car. It was too tight,” she says, because she’s not about to tell either of them anything about what happened.</p><p>“The suit looks weird without it.”</p><p>“Thank you, my son.” She turns to Valentina. “You can stay the night here and I’ll try to have a more productive conversation with her tomorrow. Maybe if it’s before five she won’t be trashed.”</p><p>“She doesn’t function on society’s clock. She’s always trashed.”</p><p>Agatha frowns and grabs a piece of pizza, not even caring that it’s cold. “How unfortunate.”</p><p>“Yep. But thank you for trying, and for letting me stay.”</p><p>“Of course, hon. Help yourself to anything in the kitchen. I’ll get you some sheets and blankets and a pillow. Is the sofa okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, of course. Or the floor in Nicky’s room.”</p><p>Agatha sort of grimaces. “I’d prefer the sofa, but I won’t insist.”</p><p>“Oh, you mean because you think…”</p><p>“MOM!” Nicky shouts, face resembling a tomato. “We aren’t doing that!”</p><p>Agatha holds her hands up in surrender but can’t help taking one last jab. “Fine, fine. I just can’t afford to have a bunch of baby NickyVees running around all of a sudden.”</p><p>“AHHHHHH!” Nicky explodes at her and stomps off to his room.</p><p>Valentina snorts with laughter. “He’s so easy to embarrass. I feel almost bad for him.”</p><p>“Not me, it’s my number one joy in life."</p><p>She’ll apologize to him later. Maybe.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>By the time Rio is able to get her bearings enough to sit up, the stripper’s gone. What the actual fuck? What—she needs to know who ordered that woman and from where.</p><p>She staggers to her feet, leaning on the bedpost for support, and fumbles her way out to the living room. The world is still spinning, making her head pound, and she sees two faces for every one. She blinks and shakes her head to clear it, but nothing changes. “Who ordered that stripper?” she demands.</p><p>She can’t see anyone’s eyes but it feels like they all turned to look at her.</p><p>“What stripper?”</p><p>“Not me.”</p><p>“I don’t think anyone ordered a stripper.”</p><p>Rio’s head feels like it’s about to split in half. “Not a single person in this house called and ordered a stripper?”</p><p>Blurred movement would indicate shaking heads.</p><p>“Who the fuck was that woman, then?”</p><p>More blurred movement.</p><p>So Rio has just dragged a literal stranger through her house, assuming the woman was a stripper, when she most likely was not, and the woman let her believe that, for what? Was she just… a prostitute at the wrong house? A pissed off neighbor? An undercover cop?</p><p>“What’s that?” someone asks.</p><p>“What’s what?” Rio snaps.</p><p>“In your hand.”</p><p>Rio looks down, squinting, trying to make out what she’s holding, when she realizes she doesn’t need to see it to know what it is. She’s still holding the woman’s fucking tie.</p><p>So maybe it was Cinder-fucking-ella.</p><p>“Everyone get out,” she says, her tone brooking no argument. Anyone who’s anyone knows that when Rio Vidal says the words ‘get out’, the party is officially over.</p><p>There’s much grumbling and under-the-breath complaining, but she sees all of the blurred figures get up and file out the door, then locks it behind them and flops face first onto the sofa.</p><p>It feels better to lay down, but she’s still nauseated and dizzy, and the stark memory of the woman’s disdainful words still echoes in her ears.</p><p><em>You’re pathetic.</em></p><p>She turns her head to the side because she can’t breathe with her face in the cushion.</p><p><em>You’re like a fucking disease, infecting everyone around you.</em></p><p>Maybe she is. She pulls up her dress.</p><p><em>A waste of space. That’s what you are, isn’t it, Rio?</em></p><p>“Yes,” she whispers to the memory, stretches the tie across her mouth and bites down on it. She can smell the woman’s scent lingering on the fabric and feels it flare her nostrils. No one should be allowed to smell that good.</p><p><em>Hire someone to change the sheets because you probably don’t know how to do it yourself.</em></p><p>She shoves one hand underneath her and inside her five-hundred-dollar panties, replaying the woman’s words over and over, and ruts against the sofa cushion until she comes apart, teeth gritted on that goddamn fucking tie.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio doesn’t usually dream. Or at least she doesn’t remember her dreams. But that night she dreams vividly of wild hair and sharp wit and blue eyes. Of going sailing with the woman, sitting on the deck while the woman takes them further and further from shore. Wondering whether she’s going to be tossed over the side to the sharks circling beneath the surface of the crisp, cool water when they get out far enough. Or maybe she’ll be treated to more of the woman’s vocal disdain, laid out on the bow and taken apart piece by piece.</p><p>She wakes up the next morning with a gasp, the dreams assaulting her waking psyche and leaving her trembling, unsure which way is up.</p><p>She doesn’t dream. Rio Vidal, self-made millionaire, doesn’t dream.</p><p>Except maybe that’s just because she’s never met anyone she wanted to dream about.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She needs a shower. Badly. She feels her way to the kitchen, to her hangover drawer, takes a mouthful of water from the tap, and throws back a handful of pills.</p><p>She turns the shower on so hot it burns her skin, trying to wash away the images from her dreams. The memory of getting herself off with the woman’s tie in her mouth. It’s shameful to be so affected by a stranger. Rutting like a bitch in heat to the smell of her and the echoes of degradation she’d uttered as she had Rio pinned beneath her.</p><p>It’s not helping. She rests her forehead on the shower wall, hoping the contrast of soft scalding water and cold hard tile will kickstart her brain into being who she’s supposed to be.</p><p>Untouchable.</p><p>She emerges feeling more like a drowned rat than an affluent businesswoman, and the shrill ringing of her cell phone irritates her to no end.</p><p>“What?” she snaps into it.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal? This is Principal Rooks from your daughter’s high school.”</p><p>“She’s not my daughter,” Rio says, voice dripping with acid. How dare he.</p><p>“I beg your pardon, your niece,” he says.</p><p>“Okay,” she says. And when he doesn’t say anything else right away she adds, “What do you want? I’m busy.”</p><p>He clears his throat. “Ms. Vidal, I’ve been trying to reach you for several days.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And we need you to come down to the school. Today.”</p><p>“For what?”</p><p>“Your niece has been sent home every day since she started school here. Are you not aware?”</p><p>“Of course I’m aware,” she lies. “What about it?”</p><p>“We need to meet and make a plan to help her settle in to the school year.”</p><p>“Why can’t you just do that?”</p><p>“Because you’re her legal guardian, and whatever plan we come up with here, you’ll need to be enforcing at home.”</p><p>“She’s seventeen, why don’t you just let her do what she wants? That sounds like a lot of effort and frankly I’m not interested.”</p><p>He clears his throat again and she wonders if he’s thirsty or just noisy. “I’m sorry Ms. Vidal, but if we can’t get you down to the school today we’ll have to involve the police.”</p><p>“What the fuck? Ugh! Fine, I’ll come.” She hangs up and storms up the stairs to get dressed. She puts on a halter-style floor-length dress and heels, and scrubs the hell out of her teeth because her mouth tastes like fucking death, throws her hair up haphazardly, sniffs a fat line, and at the last minute on her way out the door she grabs the devil’s tie and slips it on over her head.</p><p>A glance in the rearview as she backs out of her driveway – yeah, she drives once in awhile – reveals smeared makeup racoon style, or maybe Amazon warrior style, but who cares? It’s just a school. She’s not going to any effort for these fucks. And it makes her look like a sexy hot mess anyway. She’s into it.</p><p>She has no idea where the office is so she snags a passing student by the sleeve and makes him direct her there. When she pushes open the door and steps in, she’s met with a smiling woman wearing a godawful shade of peach lipstick. “That color makes you look washed out,” she says instantly. “You should wear red.”</p><p>The woman’s smile falters for a split second before it’s plastered back on. “And what can I do for you, ma’am?”</p><p>“Ugh, don’t call me ma’am for starters. Do I look old to you? I’m here to see the principal.”</p><p>“Which one? Principal Rooks or Principal Harding?”</p><p>Rio stares. “Why do you have two?”</p><p>“We have a lot of students. Which one are you here to see?”</p><p>“I don’t care.”</p><p>“Do you have an appointment?”</p><p>“The school called and told me I had to come.”</p><p>“Okay, have a seat and let me just find out for you.”</p><p>Rio leans on the counter instead and busies herself playing with paper clips.</p><p>The woman turns away and cups her hand over her mouth but Rio can still hear what she says.</p><p>“There’s a… woman… here claiming she got a call and was told to come down?”</p><p>Why the pause before ‘woman’? “What, do you think I’m not old enough to be considered a woman?” she says when the secretary hangs up. “First I’m ma’am and now I’m too young?”</p><p>The secretary’s cheeks flush and she points behind her. “Principal Rooks will see you now.”</p><p>“Can’t wait,” Rio mutters and pushes open the swinging divider to head in the direction she’s been pointed in.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” he says, extending a hand when she reaches his office.</p><p>“That’s as bad as ma’am. Just call me Rio,” she says, slouching into a chair across from his desk without shaking his hand.</p><p>“Valentina is on her way down.”</p><p>“Awesome.”</p><p>They sit in awkward silence for about three minutes and then her niece appears in the doorway, who immediately scowls at her.</p><p>“Oh, it’s <em>you</em>. I was hoping it would be Agatha.”</p><p>“Who the fuck is Agatha and why would she be at this… guardian conference thing?”</p><p>“What do you mean who’s Agatha? She’s my friend’s mom. You met her last night. You’re wearing her fucking tie.”</p><p>Rio’s brain seizes. Her jaw goes slack, her blood heats up, her heart starts to race. “What?” A hand closes protectively around the tie as if she can make it not be true.</p><p>“Ha!” Valentina barks out a laugh. “You’re blushing. Why are you blushing, <em>Auntie</em> Rio?”</p><p>The familial term is tossed at her like a slur. Still she can’t find words. Still she can’t find breath. Still she can’t find clarity.</p><p>“Valentina, would you please have a seat?” the principal interrupts at last, motioning toward the other chair.</p><p>Valentina sits with one foot up on the chair, knee bent, and the other foot on the floor.</p><p>Rio tries to listen when the principal starts talking, but visions of the previous night won’t leave her alone.</p><p>“So, I called this meeting in the hopes of motivating Valentina to do some school work and—” Untamed hair. “—because we really want to make it as easy as possible for you to succeed, Valent—” Heated blue gaze. “—property destruction and disrespect, and—” <em>You’re pathetic</em>. “—sound agreeable to you both?”</p><p>Rio blinks herself out of it and sits up straighter, letting go of the tie. “Could you repeat that?”</p><p>“Are you fucking kidding?” Valentina snipes.</p><p>“I have a fucking headache!” Rio snipes back.</p><p>“It’s not a problem,” the principal says. “Valentina hasn’t done any of her school work and we were hoping you might have some suggestions on how to motivate her to participate in her education.”</p><p>“This should be good. She doesn’t even know I exist, she won’t have one goddamn idea how to motivate me.”</p><p>“Money,” Rio blurts.</p><p>And to her surprise, Valentina stops antagonizing her. “Yeah, okay. That’ll work.”</p><p>“If that’s what you both think is best,” the principal says, clearly willing to try anything. Because even Rio knows that money isn’t something you should offer a kid to do their school work. “There is also the matter of the fires she’s been setting in the girls’ bathrooms.”</p><p>Rio’s head snaps toward her niece. “You hear that? Stop setting fucking fires.”</p><p>Valentina rolls her eyes.</p><p>“So, uh, Ms. Vidal—Rio—maybe you could make sure that Valentina doesn’t come to school carrying a lighter?”</p><p>“She touches me she loses a hand,” Valentina growls.</p><p>Rio glares at her. “You want your money? Gimme the lighter.” She holds out her hand.</p><p>Valentina looks indecisive for a minute and then pulls it out of her jacket pocket and slams it into Rio’s palm.</p><p>“Ah,” she hisses, because that hurt, and she pockets the lighter while shaking out her stinging hand. She sighs and looks at the principal. “Anything <em>else</em>?”</p><p>“Besides not doing school work and setting fires? No, I believe that covers everything we needed to speak about.”</p><p>“How much money am I getting?” Valentina asks as she follows Rio out of the office.</p><p>“I don’t know. A hundred bucks a day if you do all your work and don’t set any fires?”</p><p>“You’re loaded. I want two hundred a day.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t give a flying fuck. “Two hundred a day then. Don’t make me have to come back here.”</p><p>“Fine by me. I didn’t want you here anyway.”</p><p>“Why do I smell coffee?”</p><p>“There’s a back to school meeting in the library. Today it’s for the eleventh graders and their parents.”</p><p>Rio veers toward the smell. She’s at least going to get something out of this. “Over here?” she asks. There’s a set of double doors ahead.</p><p>“Yeah. You’re not going to go in there, are you? I’m in twelfth grade and you’re not my parent.”</p><p>“I’m gonna get some coffee. Nobody cares.”</p><p>“Agatha’s not going to like that you stole her tie.”</p><p>“I didn’t steal it, she left it,” Rio hisses. And then. The blood drains out of her body because… “She’s in there?”</p><p>“Yeah, Nicky’s in eleventh.”</p><p>And then the anger starts to bubble up, and, hand shaking, Rio grabs the door handle and shoves. The door flies open and crashes into the wall, and Rio scans the crowd until she sees <em>Agatha</em>.</p>

<p>Agatha turns her head at the sound of the door crashing open, and her heart jumps into her throat when she sees a furious Rio Vidal standing in the room.</p><p>Their eyes meet, and Agatha knows this is going to be absolutely ugly. And—holy fuck, Rio’s wearing her tie.</p><p>And walking toward her. Fuck, fuck, fuck, this is going to be bad. So bad. Unsalvageable.</p><p>“You let me think you were a stripper?” is the first thing out of Rio’s mouth. And it’s loud. And there’s not a single person in the library that didn’t hear it. Including her son.</p><p>She keeps her voice as neutral as possible. “Can we not do this here?”</p><p>“You called me a self-centered slut!” Rio shrieks.</p><p>Agatha feels her face burning but she’s not going to shout back. She leans closer and keeps her voice low. “Where’s the lie?”</p><p>Rio looks positively unhinged.</p><p>“Mom!” Nicky says, and she’s looking at Rio but she can hear the mortification in Nicky’s voice and it kills her.</p><p>Valentina, on the other hand, sounds gleeful. “You did? Fuck yeah!”</p><p>Principal Rooks comes rushing in and stops next to Rio. “Would you ladies please take this outside of the school?”</p><p>Rio’s lip curls up and she actually snarls at him. “You’re going to regret it,” she promises, focused on Agatha again.</p><p>“If you’re so offended, why are you wearing my tie?” She reaches over and rips it off of the train wreck of a woman in front of her. “Go dunk yourself in some cold water and sober up.”</p><p>Rio reaches for the tie, and the look on her face has gone from outraged to lost and vulnerable, but Agatha pulls it out of reach, not about to let her <em>keep</em> it, and takes a step back.</p><p>“Ladies, please. I have to insist. I’ll call security if I have to.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Principal Rooks,” Agatha says. And she walks away before Rio can follow her, across to the side door and out into the cool air of the interior courtyard, leaning against the wall and trying to breathe.</p><p>Damage control with her son is going to be difficult. Why did Rio have to do that in front of him?</p><p>She hears the door open again and prays it’s not Rio, or Nicky, and to her utter relief it’s Lilia from the PTA. Someone she admires and respects, who raised her own children and is now raising her grandchildren, and who maybe might have a kind word for her in this dumpster fire of a moment.</p><p>Lilia sits down and pats the cement next to her, so Agatha slides down the wall.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>“Nicky will understand.”</p><p>“I don’t think he will.”</p><p>“Give him a little more credit than that.”</p><p>“He sounded so humiliated,” Agatha says, tears stinging her eyes. “Why did she have to say that in front of him? How hard would it have been to step outside?”</p><p>“For a coked-up socialite? Probably pretty hard.”</p><p>Agatha laughs a little. “Thank you for that.”</p><p>“Get back in there, hold your head up, and talk to your son.”</p><p>“Is she gone?”</p><p>“She’s gone. She tried to follow you so Principal Rooks had security escort her out.”</p><p>“Thank God for small favors.”</p><p>Lilia chuckles and pats her knee, then points at the tie. “Did you gag her with it?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha’s gaze snaps to the fabric, and her eyes widen at the perfect set of teeth marks indented into it. “Oh my God. No, I didn’t.”</p><p>Lilia’s chuckle darkens, and she doesn’t say anything else, she just gets up and goes inside, holding the door for Agatha.</p><p>--</p><p>She takes Nicky and Valentina to an empty classroom and shuts the door. Nicky’s picking at his fingernails and Vee is beaming.</p><p>“I did not tell her I was a stripper,” she says first thing. “She assumed when she answered the door, and I didn’t correct her because she had a bunch of people over and I figured the best way to get her alone to speak to her was to go along with it.”</p><p>“Probably figured right,” Vee says.</p><p>Nicky says nothing. He won’t even look at her. She chokes up all over again.</p><p>“Nicky I’m so sorry,” she says, voice quiet. “I never meant for you to get embarrassed… I never wanted any of that to happen. I was just trying to protect your friend, I…” She doesn’t know what else to say.</p><p>“By calling her names, mom?” Nicky finally speaks, looking up.</p><p>“I could’ve handled it better,” she agrees. “I got upset when she so obviously didn’t care about anything and I lashed out at her.”</p><p>“She is a self-centered slut,” Valentina says. “Nothing wrong with saying the truth.”</p><p>“No, he’s right,” Agatha insists. “I should have done better.” She walks over and squats down in front of the desk he’s sitting at. “Can I still be your mom?”</p><p>It’s what she always asks when he’s been mad at her, ever since he was old enough to talk.</p><p>“Yeah,” he says grumpily.</p><p>Relief floods through Agatha like the crash of a tidal wave on a dry shore, because this was the very first time she was afraid to hear his answer.</p><p>“It sucks you lied to me though mom,” he says a few seconds later. “You didn’t take off your tie in the car, obviously, if she came here wearing it.”</p><p>“I’m sorry baby, I shouldn’t have lied. I just always want to protect you.”</p><p>Valentina’s enthusiasm has rapidly disappeared and Agatha glances over to see her silently crying.</p><p>“Heeeey,” she says, switching desks, rubbing the girl’s back. “What’s wrong honey?”</p><p>Vee leans into her and wraps her arms around her waist. “I miss my mom,” she chokes out.</p><p>“Ohh, sweet pea, I know you do,” Agatha says, hugging her back. “I know you do.”</p><p>Nicky gets up and makes heart hands at her as he slips out the door to give them privacy.</p><p>“I hate living with my aunt,” Vee continues. “She’s so cold, she doesn’t even care that her brother’s dead and she always hated my mom!”</p><p>Agatha rocks back and forth a little on her feet with Valentina cradled against her stomach. “You are welcome at my and Nicky’s house any time, okay? Literally any time of the day or night. Any time you need to be there. For any reason. Okay?”</p><p>Vee nods and holds her tighter.</p><p>Agatha is going to have to try again with Rio because this is absolutely unacceptable. This girl should not be feeling unwanted after losing both her parents and being uprooted from her life and plopped down in a strange place.</p><p>--</p><p>She waits until Saturday so she can go in the afternoon, and leaves Nicky and Vee watching some action movie. This time, she goes in comfortable clothes that are not mistakable for stripper attire – though how many strippers wear suits? Really? But she’s in jogging pants and a beater tank, just to be safe.</p><p>She raps on the door, and a few minutes later it swings open.</p><p>Rio looks tired, but when she sees who it is, she bares her teeth and growls. Agatha raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>“Absolutely the fuck not.”</p><p>“Rio, come on!” she hears from inside the house.</p><p>Agatha reaches into the pocket of her joggers and pulls out her tie. “You want this?”</p><p>Rio’s Pavlovian response is glaringly obvious as she licks her lips and reaches for it.</p><p>Agatha tuts and puts it back in her pocket. “Get rid of your friends and let me in.”</p><p>She doesn’t know what it is about the tie, but she watches with fascination as Rio steps out of the way to let her in, then continues to the living room and addresses her guests. “Get out.”</p><p>“We just got here,” one of them gripes, and Agatha watches Rio’s eyes turn to razors, honing in on the girl who said it.</p><p>“And you won’t be back,” Rio promises. “Get the fuck out.”</p><p>Agatha stands against the foyer wall to let them all past, and Rio slams the door after the last one, flicking the deadbolt locked.</p><p>She takes the tie out of her pocket again and holds it up, then walks down the hall to the room she’d been taken to last time she was here, and hears Rio’s footsteps click-clacking behind her on the top-tier wood.</p><p>When they’re in the room with the door shut, even though they’re alone in the house, she hangs the tie from one curled finger and asks, “what did you do with my tie?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio lies to her. “Give it to me. I let you in and got rid of my guests.”</p><p>“Not nothing,” Agatha says, slowly shaking her head. “I want to know what you did with it. There’s <em>teeth</em> marks in it, Rio.”</p><p>A flush crawls up Rio’s neck. “I was trying to rip it.”</p><p>Agatha laughs. “No, sugar, you weren’t trying to rip it. These teeth marks are perfectly indented, not scraped like they would be if that were the truth. What. Did. You do with it?”</p><p>She thinks the question has triggered some sort of fight or flight for a second, but then Rio gives in. “I bit it.”</p><p>Surprised at the actual admission, but pleased nonetheless, she pushes further. “<em>Why</em>?”</p><p>Rio sneers at her. “Figure it out.”</p><p>Agatha’s not deterred. She swings the tie back and forth, watching Rio’s eyes track it. “Where were you when you put my tie in your mouth, Rio?”</p><p>“On the sofa,” Rio says, and Agatha hears her breath catch.</p><p>“Were you alone?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>That answer throws her off because she thought for sure Rio would have been using the tie for some kinky sex shit just to be a dick, but the more she stands there, the darker Rio’s cheeks flush, the clearer things get. And she realizes that Rio being alone definitely does not mean she didn’t use the tie for kinky sex shit. “Did you get yourself off biting my tie?” Her voice is higher pitched than she’d like, but holy god damn.</p><p>“No!” Rio shouts. “Give me the fucking tie and get out of my house.”</p><p>Agatha’s deliciously amused. “You did. You fucked yourself after I left, and you gagged yourself with my tie. Because it turned you on so bad having a stripper humiliate and degrade you and then leave you to deal with yourself.”</p><p>“You’re not even a stripper,” Rio says, eyes narrowed.</p><p>Agatha pockets the tie and the transformation is instant. Rio’s expression turns pleading, a whimper escaping parted lips. “What is it about my tie?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head as if the answer to that question is worse than admitting she’d gotten herself off.</p><p>Agatha shrugs and starts for the door.</p><p>“I’ll admit it!” Rio shouts, launching herself in front of the door. “I got myself off thinking about you. About what you said to me. About your hair and your eyes. And I put the tie in my mouth because it smelled like you, and I rutted against the sofa cushion like a pathetic, drug-addled waste of space until I came all over my hand, is that what you want to hear?”</p><p>Agatha’s brain short circuits, because it’s not what she expected to hear. Not all those details. And what leaves her mouth is not what she expects to leave her mouth. “Do it again.”</p><p>“What?” Rio gasps. “Are you fucking crazy? Not a chance in hell, you psychotic fucking—”</p><p>She stops talking because Agatha whips the tie out again and stretches it across Rio’s mouth, forcing it between her teeth.</p><p>Rio’s eyes go wide, but she bites down. She’s shaking. Trembling. Her chest is heaving.</p><p>“Do. It. Again.”</p><p>Rio swallows hard, staring at Agatha, a glassy coating covering those big brown eyes. And then, with a wholly pathetic, tiny whimper, she nods.</p><p>Agatha contains herself to a mere nod in response, then lifts her chin toward the door to indicate Rio should precede her out of the room.</p><p>Rio keeps the tie between her teeth and turns, opens the door, then wobbles down the hall to the living room.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth finally catches up to her brain. “You’re going to do it exactly how you did it last time.”</p><p>Rio lowers herself to the sofa and lays face down with her head turned toward Agatha and her eyes closed.</p><p>On her stomach? Jesus. “That’s how you were before?” she asks, making her tone sound sharper than she wants it.</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>And then she reaches down to pull up her dress, and Agatha’s so entirely fucked. Because it’s the hottest thing she’s ever seen. <em>Rio</em> is the hottest thing she’s ever seen. And face down on the sofa with her dress rucked up around her hips? Jesus fucking Christ.</p><p>Rio hesitates, and Agatha snaps at her.</p><p>“What are you waiting for?”</p><p>Rio whimpers again and works a hand underneath her, into the front of her panties, and grinds her hips against the sofa cushion.</p><p>Agatha forgets how to breathe.</p><p>She’ll never see anything so beautiful again as long as she lives. The frustrated, concentrated look on Rio’s pretty face. The way her back muscles work as she moves. The expensive lace thong that does nothing to hide the smooth, flawless shape of her ass. The little noises she’s making. The sweet smell of her expensive house. The way her feet are crossed at the ankle, high heels knocking together with every rut of her hips.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything because she knows anything she says will just help Rio out. But she’s never seen anything like this, and she’s transfixed. It’s hard to decide where to put her eyes so she just tracks them up and down, from Rio’s face to her middle to her crossed ankles, looking at and taking in everything.</p><p>And she finds herself anticipating the moment when Rio falls apart. Finds herself aching to witness it. She doesn’t even want to consider what any of this says about her.</p><p>As Rio gets closer, Agatha gets more and more agitated, wanting her to come.</p><p>She can’t take it anymore. Her mouth opens and issues the most grievous betrayal of her self-control she has ever experienced. “Fucking whore,” she hisses, and Rio comes undone.</p><p>It’s majestic, the way she nearly screams, her head lifting off the sofa, back arched, hips stuttering out an orgasm. Then she collapses fully, and Agatha can see her back rising and falling with labored breaths.</p><p>Angry at herself, she strides forward, grabs Rio by the hair, and rips the tie out of her mouth. “If you want to see this again, you’re gonna start cleaning up your act,” she vows. “And if you ever mention anything in front of those children again, I will burn it to fucking ash.”</p><p>She drops Rio’s hair and heads for the front door. When she hears a thud from behind her, curiosity gets the better of her and she stops with her hand on the doorknob, looking over her shoulder, and Rio is on her knees.</p><p>“Please don’t take it,” she begs.</p><p>“It’s mine,” Agatha snaps and leaves.</p>

<p>Rio watches her go, feeling broken. It’s just a tie to Agatha, but it’s so much more to her. It represents the one spark of life in her dead black heart. The one spark of anything she’s felt in the last twenty-something years. And it’s gone. It’s gone. For what? So she can be alone and indifferent again. Never wanting, never taking, never having. Never seeing the point in being human.</p><p>Cleaning up her act? She wouldn’t even know where to begin.</p><p>Aching and empty, she crawls to the coffee table, crushes up an eight ball, and sniffs her problems away up her nose.</p><p>She doesn’t know how long she lays sprawled out on the carpet staring at the ceiling, but at some point she hears the door and ignores it. She resolves to ignore everything for the rest of the night. Week, maybe. Or her entire life. Nothing good comes from paying attention.</p><p>Her niece’s face appears above hers. “Get up.”</p><p>“Go fuck yourself?” Rio scoffs.</p><p>“I’m serious, get up, CYS is here and a cop. You’re lucky I convinced them to let me come in first and make sure you were awake.”</p><p>Rio’s buzz is instantly killed and she shoots up, closing every magazine on the table to hide what she’s sure would amount to over an ounce of possession charges, and scrambles to shove all of the paraphernalia under the couch.</p><p>“The only reason I’m not turning your dumb ass in is because I want that two hundred bucks a day, so don’t even think about trying to stiff me on it.”</p><p>Rio growls and staggers to her feet, brushing her hair back uselessly and going to open the door.</p><p>Valentina stops her. “Actually, I want three hundred a day or I’ll go open up those magazines.”</p><p>“Fine! God!” Rio hisses and jerks open the door.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal?” There’s a woman in a skirt suit standing next to a uniformed police officer.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“My name is Anastasia Ballard, I’m with Child and Youth Services. We received a call about your situation here and need to perform a short investigation to make sure Valentina’s needs are being met. May we come in?”</p><p>“Do I have a choice?” She looks at the officer. “And why are you here?”</p><p>He takes off his hat. “Standard procedure, ma’am.”</p><p>“Don’t call me ma’am. I guess you can come in, let’s just get this over with.” She moves out of the way and they both step inside. “What do you need to know?”</p><p>“We’ll need to check there’s adequate food in the house, that Valentina has a bedroom with a bed to sleep in and a dresser for her clothes. We’ll need to inspect the house for any safety hazards such as mold, unsteady flooring, exposed electrical wires, things like that.”</p><p>“Why would she have a bed for any reason other than to sleep in it?”</p><p>“I beg your pardon?”</p><p>“You said check she has a bed to sleep in. What else would it be for?”</p><p>“They just say that, Auntie Rio,” Valentina interrupts. “Can you show them my room or should I?”</p><p>The girl damn well knows Rio doesn’t give a fuck which room she sleeps in. “You go ahead.” She watches them go down the hall and turns to the officer. “Are you going in every room because I don’t want you in my closet.”</p><p>He just clutches his hat to his chest with one hand and scratches his nose with the other. “That’s up to Mrs. Ballard, ma’am.”</p><p>“I said don’t call me ma’am.”</p><p>He doesn’t say anything else.</p><p>“So you’ll stay out of my closet?”</p><p>“That’s not my call.”</p><p>She rolls her eyes and flops down on the sofa.</p><p>Ages later the CYS woman comes back into the living room with her niece. “Her bedroom looks good, but the lack of food in the kitchen is a problem,” the woman says.</p><p>“We order in,” Rio says.</p><p>“Be that as it may, the state requires you to keep enough nutrition in the house for a child at all times,” the woman says. “You’ll have three days to correct the issue or you’ll be issued a fine and Valentina may be removed to a temporary foster home until further notice.”</p><p>Rio’s about to open up her mouth and say best case scenario when she catches Valentina’s eye, who very obviously glances down at the magazines on the coffee table. So Rio ends up agreeing to fix it. “Fine. I’ll get groceries delivered tonight.”</p><p>“If you need a list of acceptable foods to meet the criteria—”</p><p>“No, I think I can figure it out, thanks,” she deadpans. “Are you done?”</p><p>“For today, yes. I’ll be back in three days to verify you’ve corrected the nutritional issue. If I am able to verify that, I will close out the case.”</p><p>“Amazing. I’m sure you can walk yourself out.”</p><p>When they’re gone, Rio scowls at Valentina. “Who the fuck called them?”</p><p>“What do you care?”</p><p>Rio supposes she really doesn’t, and hums her acknowledgment of such.</p><p>“What really happened the other night?”</p><p>Rio snaps her head around at the intrusion to her inner quiet. “You’re still here?”</p><p>“I’ve been standing in front of you this entire time you fucking idiot,” her niece says, gesturing wildly. “What happened the night you stole Agatha’s tie?”</p><p>Rio grits her teeth. “I didn’t steal it,” she grinds out. “She left it here. What did she say happened? She told you I stole it? I didn’t.”</p><p>The mention of the tie has Rio’s salivary glands working overtime. She wants to tell her niece exactly what happened, and make Agatha look like the asshole she is, but the issued threat she had made still lingers. <em>…mention anything in front of those children again, I will burn it to fucking ash</em>.</p><p>“She said she told you off but you were too high to understand the situation.”</p><p>“I understood she was telling me off, I just didn’t appreciate it,” Rio lies. Because God, that’s one hundred percent untrue. The level of appreciation Rio had and still has for that telling off is through the roof. Even now, talking about it makes her hot under the collar. “I’m feeling feverish. Go away.”</p><p>Valentina rolls her eyes. “I’m going back to Agatha’s as soon as you give me my money.”</p><p>“What?” That has Rio’s undivided attention. “What do you mean going <em>back</em> to Agatha’s? You’ve been at her house?”</p><p>“Oh, suddenly Auntie’s interested in my comings and goings? Fuck off, Rio.”</p><p>A surge of sudden, irrational, white-hot jealousy rips through her entire body and leaves her standing there shaking, that anyone gets to be at Agatha’s house that isn’t <em>her</em>. And the crippling thought that now plagues her is what if Agatha has a partner?</p><p>Rio is not used to even thinking about these things, let alone caring about them, and she doesn’t know how to behave.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be at a stranger’s house. What if her boyfriend tries to molest you in your sleep?”</p><p>“Oh my God, are you for r—is that—are you fucking kidding me? For so many reasons, are you fucking kidding me?”</p><p>“What?” Rio blinks.</p><p>“First of all, hello? I had to literally steal money from you to buy a lock for my bedroom door because YOU have strange men and women here all hours of the day and night! Second of all, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, it’s just her and Nicky.”</p><p>“Who’s Nicky? Her girlfriend?” Rio doesn’t know if that’s better or worse.</p><p>“Her son, you fucking moron! My friend, who I TOLD you about, but you don’t ever fucking LISTEN because you don’t give two FUCKS about anyone but YOURSELF! Give me my fucking money before I lose my mind and go back on my promise to myself not to put my hands on you, Aunt Rio.”</p><p>Rio is so baffled by the entire exchange and her feelings about it that she just wanders absently to her purse, pulls out three hundreds, and hands them over without saying anything else.</p><p>The world is too bright and her nerves too raw, and she doesn’t care what time it is, she goes upstairs, takes a sleeping pill, and gets in bed.</p><p>--</p><p>Her unconscious has some more treats in store, because she wakes up hours and hours later screaming, clutching her stomach in a panic. When the shot of adrenaline dissipates, she’s left struggling for breath in the wake of the nightmare and looking down to make sure her insides are still on the inside.</p><p>She’s drenched in sweat, but thank god it isn’t blood, and she staggers to the shower, only realizing she didn’t take off her clothes when the wet fabric starts sticking to her body.</p><p>She’d dreamt of Agatha again, but this time… the other woman was cutting her open and pulling out her organs, slicing each one’s protective coating to bleed them out, one at a time, while Rio was forced to watch.</p><p>She tries to block out the graphic images, to ignore the phantom pain in her belly left over from the experience, but it’s all too much. They engulf her and sweep her away with the tide, and she passes out on the shower floor.</p><p>--</p><p>“Hey. Hey!”</p><p>Rio blinks her eyes open when a persistent voice won’t go away. The first thing she notices is that she’s freezing. The second thing she notices is that she’s still in the shower. The water has stopped, and her niece is crouched over her, and when she turns her head, she groans, because the entire bathroom is flooded.</p><p>“Ughhhh,” she complains. “I’m freezing.”</p><p>“Yeah, I don’t care about that. I just came by to get some stuff and noticed water dripping through the ceiling so I figured I’d make sure you weren’t dead. Can’t get paid if you’re dead and I’m not in the will.”</p><p>“Through the c—nooo, ah, fuck,” Rio curses, struggling to sit up, and when she moves off the drain, the water she’s pooled in starts swirling and gurgling as it’s sucked down.</p><p>“So, you’re alive, I’ve done my familial duty, I’m going to grab my stuff and leave now. Have fun cleaning this up.”</p><p>She watches Valentina leave the bathroom, and just as she’s putting her head in her hands to block out the situation, she hears a throat clear that is <em>decidedly</em> not her niece.</p><p>No, no, no. This is not happening. The only good thing about this is that she’s no longer freezing, she’s sweltering. “I didn’t invite you in here,” she says, trying to sound scathing, but no amount of effort is going to make her <em>actually</em> sound like she doesn’t want Agatha in her house.</p><p>“When I said clean up your act, I didn’t mean this,” Agatha says, and Rio can hear the self-satisfied grin even though she can’t see Agatha from around the corner.</p><p>“Be more specific next time,” she spits.</p><p>The chuckle she gets in response is slightly alarming.</p><p>“Right, right.” Agatha clucks her tongue, and Rio imagines it on her clit. Fuck. “What was I thinking? That someone like you would have any idea how to clean up <em>anything</em>?”</p><p>Rio shivers, but doesn’t want to lose this battle so easily. “Pour some coke on the floor, I can clean that up in five seconds,” she retorts.</p><p>She hears water sloshing, and then sees Agatha come into view and look down at her, shooting daggers. “That’s not funny. You’re responsible for a child.”</p><p>“Look at me!” Rio finally shouts, extending her arms in a helpless but angry gesture. “In what universe should my brother have left me his child?!”</p><p>Agatha reaches into the shower and grabs her by the dress, hauling her to her feet. “Then <em>do</em> something about it!”</p><p>Rio shoves her. “Don’t <em>touch</em> me!” she screams. “Fuck you and your judgment! You don’t know anything about me!”</p><p>“Don’t I?” Agatha asks, voice lowered, and Rio thinks it’s the first time she’s seen the other woman look dangerous. “I know—”</p><p>Whatever she’s about to say is cut off by the arrival of two skidding-to-a-halt teenagers in the bathroom doorway.</p><p>“Mom?” the boy—Nicky, right?—says almost nervously.</p><p>“Yeah, fuck her up!” Valentina chants.</p><p>Rio watches Agatha take her keys out of her pocket and turn to the doorway. “Vee, do you drive?”</p><p><em>Vee</em>?</p><p>“Fuck yeah I do,” Valentina says and snatches the keys out of the air when Agatha throws them.</p><p>“I’ll meet you at home,” Agatha tells her son.</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Nicky, please. I’m not going to hurt her.”</p><p><em>Likely story</em>, Rio thinks, but somehow she’s frozen in place watching and hearing this all play out.</p><p>“Okay,” he says, but Rio can tell he’s not happy about it.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything until they both hear the door shut after the kids. “Dry off and get dressed. I’ll be in the hall.”</p><p>“Why would I do anything you tell me to do?”</p><p>“Because something about my tie has triggered a response in you that makes you trainable,” Agatha says. “I’ll be in the hall.”</p>

<p>Agatha waits in the hall while Rio presumably dries off and gets dressed, but when it’s taking longer than expected, she knocks on the bedroom door. “Are you about done?”</p><p>“Fuck off,” comes the response through the door.</p><p>She snorts and opens it, and Rio is fully dressed – in a fucking ball gown and heels, at that—sitting on the edge of her bed inspecting her fingernails. She’s managed to get her hair up into a messy bun, which is ten times better than the waterlogged mess it was a half hour ago, and she’s applied makeup.</p><p>“You might want to put on something more suitable for being on your hands and knees soaking up all that water,” she says.</p><p>Rio barely looks at her. “Don’t be ridiculous. My cleaning service comes tomorrow.”</p><p>Oh my God. “Are you—you’re just planning to let that soak overnight? When it’s already dripping downstairs?”</p><p>“I’ll have to replace the floor anyway, what’s the difference?”</p><p><em>You promised Nicky you wouldn’t hurt her</em>, she tells herself. Then she wonders if hurting includes slapping, because maybe she wouldn’t be breaking her promise if she lays one on the spoiled rotten—okay no. Nope. No. She’ll just use the tie. Rio reacts to it like a dog to a bone.</p><p>She pulls it out of her pocket and slips it over her head, and she clocks the moment Rio notices because her eyes dilate and her mouth opens, and she stops examining her fingernails.</p><p><em>Good puppy</em>, she thinks. “Go get some towels.”</p><p>“I—I don’t want to clean that up,” Rio protests, hands beside her on the bed, white-knuckling the comforter.</p><p>Agatha slowly walks toward her and uses one of her knees to nudge Rio’s legs apart so she can stand between them. She runs her hand down the front of the tie and plays with the tail a little. “Do you want to wear this, Rio?”</p><p>Rio looks up at her, pupils completely blown. “Yes,” she squeaks.</p><p>“Go get some towels and you can wear it,” Agatha purrs.</p><p>Rio gives her a dubious look but skirts off the bed and disappears out the door, coming back a few minutes later with an armful of very expensive-looking thick fluffy towels.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says, and Rio drops the towels and stumbles her step.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha ignores the question and moves on, removing the tie from her own neck and slipping it over Rio’s head, enjoying the full-body shiver it produces. “Whatever it is about this tie,” she says, keeping her voice intimate, “I’m going to use it to train you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio whimpers and her knees buckle.</p><p>Agatha appreciates the view. “That’s a good start. Take one of the towels and go soak up as much water as it’ll hold.”</p><p>She watches, fascinated, as Rio picks up a towel and shuffles over to the bathroom doorway on her knees, and holy God, because just before she puts the towel down she looks over her shoulder uncertainly, and Agatha nods in encouragement, stifling a moan.</p><p>Rio turns back to the mess and lays the towel in the water.</p><p>Agatha’s hand twitches with restraint, because it would be so easy to just walk over and give Rio’s butt a few little smacks while she works. But that might be pushing too far, and Agatha’s nothing if not patient.</p><p>“When that one’s soaked, get another one and put it in,” she says, because somehow, she doesn’t think that a) Rio knows how to clean up water, and b) Rio can really think logically about what to do next right now even if she does know how to clean up water.</p><p>Rio turns to look at her. “What do I do with this one?” she asks.</p><p>“Just leave it, it won’t make the others less able to soak it up,” Agatha says. Looks like she was right. Rio doesn’t know how to clean up water.</p><p>Oh, the things her brain does to her as her eyes track Rio crawling over to get another towel and crawling back to the bathroom doorway to lay it down. Has there ever been a more appealing sight? She thinks not. Though she does try not to get too sidetracked because she’s doing this for a good reason, not just to make Rio crawl around so she can watch and get off.</p><p>When all the towels have been used up, most of the water is gone, but not all of it. “Put those in the shower, but make sure you don’t cover the drain.”</p><p>Rio stands up, picks up a few at a time and heaves them into the walk-in shower, then shoves them away from the drain with her foot when they’re all in. “Now what? There’s still water.”</p><p>“There’s not that much left. Do you have any more towels?”</p><p>“Yes, but—”</p><p>“Go get them.”</p><p>“How many more will I need?”</p><p>“Look at the amount of water that’s left and think for yourself.” <em>For once</em>.</p><p>Rio squints at the bathroom floor and Agatha can see her trying to work it out. “Maybe five?”</p><p>“Five will probably do it,” Agatha agrees. <em>See? You do have a brain</em>, she wants to say.</p><p>Rio comes back with five more fluffy towels and finishes cleaning the water from the bathroom floor, then tosses the towels into the shower and makes sure the drain is clear. Agatha watches with an approving gaze. Very trainable indeed.</p><p>She steps in and walks around, inspecting Rio’s work, and stops dead in her tracks when she sees the toilet. “Is that dried vomit all over your toilet?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Probably.”</p><p>One step forward, two steps back. “Jesus Christ, Rio. You are not making your cleaning service scrub dried vomit out of your toilet.”</p><p>Rio crosses her arms. “I pay them very well. They don’t complain.”</p><p>“To your face,” Agatha says incredulously, and lifts up the toilet seat with her shoe, then rummages around under the sink until she finds some cleaner with bleach. She sprays a generous amount around the toilet bowl and picks up the wand, holding it out to Rio. “You’re cleaning that yourself.”</p><p>“The fuck I am.”</p><p>Agatha replaces the wand for the moment and steps forward into Rio’s personal space. Rio steps back, and Agatha steps forward, until Rio’s against the wall with nowhere to go and Agatha’s almost touching her.</p><p>The air between them crackles as she lifts her hands and grabs the tie, loosening it until she can bring it up just high enough to force into Rio’s mouth. “Bite.”</p><p>Rio does.</p><p>“Get on your hands and knees and scrub the toilet until there’s no traces of vomit left.” Her voice is cold; detached.</p><p>Rio grabs onto her arm for support as she goes to her knees, then down to her hands, her breaths wheezing out as she grabs the wand and starts scrubbing.</p><p>Agatha watches her, trying so fucking hard to keep her hands to herself, and she succeeds for several minutes, but the pull is too strong and she finally gives up. She leans down and brings her palm against one of Rio’s ass cheeks, crisp and firm. “Every two minutes it’s not clean you get another,” she says, and her voice is almost unrecognizable it’s so sultry and full of gravel.</p>

<p>Rio freezes, a low moan bubbling up from her throat and winding its way past her gritted teeth. Oh god, god, god, she’s going fucking crazy, she’s sure of it. She’s never been so wet in her life. Being forced to clean her own vomit and getting spanked on her ass every two minutes she’s not done? Jesus fucking Christ. How is she meant to survive this? Feeling Agatha’s discipline, it’s just… it’s just… she doesn’t even know how to allow herself to think about it because it’s so outrageous and fuck, Agatha’s so attractive with her authoritative demands and always knowing what to do, and—</p><p>A spank lands on her other cheek and she realizes she must’ve been rambling in her head for two whole minutes not doing anything to clean the toilet, and how is she supposed to focus on anything besides the burning pain blooming across her skin that’s causing her cunt to throb and clench on nothing and beg for attention?</p><p>She doesn’t know how to clean a toilet anyway. She starts moving the wand again but she’s not doing a very good job, and not much of the dried up disgusting stuff is coming off.</p><p>Another spank lights up the left side of her ass and she whines because she <em>is</em> trying.</p><p>She hears Agatha sigh and then feels hands close around hers and show her how to angle the wand and how much pressure to use to get the job done.</p><p>Is it strange how much she wants to say thank you?</p><p>Agatha’s hands release hers but the other woman doesn’t draw completely away. There’s warm breath on her ear and whispered words that turn her inside out.</p><p>“You look pretty like this.”</p><p>The way her eyes fill with tears at the praise is pathetic. She’s used to praise, from anyone and everyone, but none of it sincere. It’s niceties and platitudes so she’ll keep letting them ride her coattails or snort her drugs or drink her booze. Nothing as simple as telling her she looks pretty on her hands and knees doing household chores.</p><p>She scrubs faster, wanting to get the job done not just to get it over with anymore, but to meet Agatha’s approval.</p><p>Another minute ticks by as she works and Agatha spanks her on the right side, the pain sharp and stinging and making her groan. But she’s almost done. There’s just one more spot. She attacks it with vigor, and finally, the toilet bowl is shining, without a trace of anything marring the porcelain surface.</p><p>She’s never been prouder of something she’s done, which she’s aware is absolutely mind-fuckingly twisted, but she doesn’t care. She looks over her shoulder at Agatha to ask for her appraisal, and the blissed out look in those haunting blue eyes imprints in Rio’s brain permanently. She will never forget it. Is Agatha affected by her in that way? In the same way Rio is affected?</p><p>Agatha leans over her to inspect her work, and the wand is lifted from her grasp and placed back in its holder. She’s not sure what to do now. Stay where she is? Get up? Sit on her heels and wait?</p><p>A hand in her hair directs her up onto her knees and forces her head back so she has no choice but to look at Agatha.</p><p>Fuck, she’s so lost. In the depths of that swirling blue hurricane she would willingly throw herself into and be consumed by. The gaze that makes her feel like being dead inside could maybe, possibly, be only a phase.</p><p>She has never anticipated anything like she anticipates Agatha’s next words.</p><p>“Good girl, Rio.”</p><p>She can feel her eyes roll back and she shudders, the words nearly flaying her alive. Her thighs are clenched so tight her pelvic floor muscles keep stabbing her in the cunt. The sound that leaves her lips as her mouth opens and the tie tumbles out to settle around her neck is nothing short of depraved. Even she can hear how utterly unhinged she sounds, but she can’t find it in herself to care. Because for once, for once in her fucking life, she <em>feels</em> something other than numb.</p>

<p>Agatha’s eyes nearly roll back too as she watches Rio’s reaction to being called a good girl after completing a task. It was different in the bedroom when she dropped the towels and said ‘what?’ because that was casual and almost flippant on Agatha’s part. This, she means it. She’s giving Rio genuine praise on a job well done, and she can tell how hard it hits. Rio is practically a writhing mess on the floor in front of her, and fuck, it is intoxicating. She’s on the highest of power highs she’s ever been on. Her senses are attuned to every movement Rio makes, every sound, every single shift in the air.</p><p>And then the girl speaks.</p><p>“Please,” Rio begs, staring up at her with watery brown eyes that tell her she holds Rio’s world in the palm of her hand.</p><p>It’s scary, to have this much power over someone. Scary, but so goddamn good.</p><p>She doesn’t respond. She doesn’t even know what Rio’s asking, for sure. And there’s no way she can give it, if it is what she thinks. As much as she’d love to sink her fingers into that pretty cunt and her teeth into that pretty throat, she can’t. That’s not what this is supposed to be.</p><p>“Please,” Rio says again, her tone taking on an escalating edge.</p><p>Agatha has to respond. She can’t just let her kneel there saying please over and over. “I can’t, sugar,” she says with a sigh. “Cleaning the bathroom once doesn’t make you any less of a self-centered slut. I can’t.”</p><p>Rio whines, a pathetic sound without any words behind it, and she can’t be still, she’s squirming constantly. She looks like she might actually cry.</p><p>Agatha switches to damage control mode quickly and tugs on the tie to get Rio to her feet. “But you can touch yourself for me, sugar,” she offers, keeping hold of the tie. “Would you like to do that? Just because I can’t make you come doesn’t mean you don’t deserve a little treat for your hard work.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes blow like fireworks and Agatha can see the indecision playing behind them. She wants it, that much is clear, but she’s struggling to really process the scene.</p><p>So Agatha waits. Just lets her eyes absorb everything about Rio’s beautiful face. Long, thick lashes. Dark painted eyelids. Broken blood vessels in the whites of her eyes. The most perfect, adorable nose Agatha’s ever seen. Parted lips, coated in glossy maroon lipstick, and for the first time, Agatha notices the absolutely precious and emotion-invoking gap between her front teeth.</p><p>She’s about to flick her gaze further down when Rio nods. And that just causes a whole new round of power-hungry thoughts and feels.</p><p>“You do want to?” she asks, fisting her hands to avoid touching Rio under the chin or on the shoulder or anywhere, really. “You want to make yourself feel good before I leave?”</p><p>Rio nods again, lower lip pulled between her teeth, and another surge of wetness leaks out onto Agatha’s underwear as she stands there deciding how to proceed.</p><p>“You did a good job on the toilet, and soaking up the water,” Agatha says quietly, letting the tiniest bit of affection taint her tone. “Would you like to show me everything this time? Or would you like to do it the same as before?”</p><p>Rio’s chest is heaving and a rivulet of blood forms where her teeth are digging the most sharply into her lip. Her eyelids flutter as she says, “show you everything.”</p><p>Agatha’s nostrils flare and she grits her teeth until her jaw aches. Then slowly nods. “Get up on the bed then. On your back.”</p><p>Rio wobbles less than usual as she walks past and climbs up onto the bed, into the middle of the plush, five-billion-thread-count comforter, and turns on her back.</p><p>Agatha notices everything. The way the mattress dips beneath her weight, the way it forms to the shape of her. The trembling in her arms and legs. The rise and fall of her chest. The glistening sweat on her forehead. “Get your dress up,” she says.</p><p>Rio does.</p><p>Agatha sits on the edge of the bed and reaches over, careful not to touch Rio’s skin as she pinches the waistband of her La Perla underwear and drags them down shaking legs.</p><p>“Did you wear these in the shower?” she whispers, dangling the saturated fabric over Rio’s face.</p><p>As expected, a flush starts on her neck, and Rio shakes her head.</p><p>“They’re ruined,” Agatha purrs, tossing them over her shoulder. “You ruined La Perla underwear getting off to being forced to scrub vomit out of your toilet.”</p><p>Rio whines, her hips lifting.</p><p>Agatha is met with a very close-up view of her dripping cunt and the smell assaults her like a prime cut of meat the moment your knife first slices into it. It makes her literally drool.</p><p>She backs off slowly to avoid burying her face between Rio’s legs and ruining everything she’s working for.</p><p>She crawls over Rio on all fours and then backs down the bed. “Show me,” she says.</p><p>Rio eases her knees apart and lets Agatha have her fill of looking. Which Agatha could never reach, because no amount of looking at Rio’s pussy will ever be enough, she’s decided that right now. It’s perfect. And the way her clit is standing at attention, already starved and needy… Christ, she needs a cold shower. Preferably not one that floods the bathroom.</p><p>“You know how pathetic this is, right?” she asks, tilting her head, tutting at Rio.</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>Because of course she does.</p><p>And then in an echo of the last time, she snaps, “what are you waiting for?”</p><p>Rio startles at the abrupt tone change and drops a hand between her legs, running her fingertip up and down through her glistening labia. Agatha appreciates the way they flower and fold in the wake of the touch, with every pass of Rio’s finger.</p><p>“Your cunt is hungry,” she whispers. “Do you not feed her often enough?” She feels like a vampire with venom swirling in her mouth, the way she wants to bite Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“I—I’m not usually interested,” Rio pants, and her finger stills.</p><p>Agatha can’t be held responsible for her actions because she’s on a hair trigger, and when Rio’s finger stops moving, she claps her hand down sharply on the inside of one thigh. “Don’t stop.”</p><p>Rio yelps and her hips buck and she resumes the motion of her finger up and down, and a red handprint forms on her thigh, and Agatha is satisfied for the moment, sitting back on her haunches with a low growl.</p><p>“Don’t stop again.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio says, eyes trained on Agatha’s mouth, and when her finger dips down near her clenching hole, Agatha can see the muscles trying to suck it inside.</p><p>Rio denies her cunt what it wants and strokes back upward, and Agatha shakes her head. “Put them in.”</p><p>Rio groans and arches her back off the bed, supported by the back of her head on her pillows, and crawls her finger lower again, joining it with her middle, and puts them both inside herself.</p><p>“Thumb on your clit, let’s go, sugar, I don’t have all night…”</p><p>Rio makes a little mewling sound and obeys, rubbing her thumb over her clit as she fingers herself, and soon her hips are jerking toward every circle she makes.</p><p>“There you go,” Agatha croons. “So pretty fucking yourself for me, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio eats up the praise like a starving piranha, teeth gnashing and all, as if she can suck the words out of the air and swallow them. She peaks almost instantly, shuddering with pleasure, drawing her knees up to help her ride out the storm.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says in a low, purring voice, sliding up the bed to take her tie from around Rio’s neck. “I’ve got to go.” She puts the tie on herself and Rio clearly doesn’t want her to go but doesn’t seem to have the energy to do more than whimper.</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha is bombarded with questions when she steps through the door.</p><p>“Mom, did you hit her? You didn’t, did you? How did you get home?”</p><p>“Uber.”</p><p>“I hope you did, please tell me you smacked her right in the mouth?”</p><p>Agatha blinks at them both, at their conflicting ideologies, and can she honestly say she didn’t hit her when she spanked her a few times? Yes, Jesus, of course she can say that. She has to say that. “No no, I didn’t hit her,” she says.</p><p>Nicky sighs with relief but Valentina just looks shrewd.</p><p>“You totally did. What did you do?” she insists.</p><p>Agatha levels them both with a very parental stare. “I am not discussing anything that happened with either of you. You’re children, so go be children and play video games.”</p><p>When they’re otherwise occupied, she’s going to lock herself in the bathroom, shower, and get herself off.</p><p>“Will you play with us?” Nicky asks.</p><p>Aaaaaand, her plans of privacy and taking care of herself will have to wait. “Yeah, of course, baby,” she says. “Let me just change into pajamas.” Because she’s not playing video games in uncomfortably wet underwear, she draws the line.</p><p>Both of their faces light up and she’s glad she didn’t say no. She shuffles off to get changed, and, much more comfortable, flops onto the sofa and reaches for one of Nicky’s controllers.</p><p>“I suck, by the way,” she tells Valentina.</p><p>“At which game?” Vee asks.</p><p>“All of them,” Agatha says.</p><p>Nicky grins, navigating menus. “She’s not that bad,” he says.</p><p>“Oh, I am,” Agatha argues. “He’s just nice because he loves me.”</p><p>“Okay, she’s really bad at Fortnite,” Nicky finally relents. “But not bad at Mario Party. And we can’t play Fortnite with three of us anyway because the split screen would be too small and I don’t know if it would even split three ways, so we’ll just play Mario Party.”</p><p>“Thank God,” Agatha mutters. She hates playing Fortnite because even though Nicky’s nice when they get ranked like number forty-eight, she hates making him lose. Not that he’s a kid who cares too much about winning, but still.</p><p>“He probably doesn’t care how good you are at playing, just thinks it’s cool you’ll play with him,” Valentina says, a little subdued. “My dad used to play with me. Mom not so much. Once in a while. But she was shit at it too. I didn’t care, though. I’d rather have lost playing with her than won playing by myself when I was younger.”</p><p>Agatha gives her a quick side hug, not wanting to draw too much attention to the emotion behind her story, but wanting to acknowledge it, and then starts hitting buttons on her controller.</p><p>“Mom, it’s loading.”</p><p>“I know. I’m practicing.”</p><p>She loses almost every round, but she has fun playing with them, and around ten o’clock she stretches with an exaggerated sigh. “Okay. Bedtime for me. Work in the morning.”</p><p>“Gross, on a Sunday?” Vee asks, scrunching up her nose.</p><p>“If I want to afford the mortgage and food,” Agatha says.</p><p>“I can pay you some rent,” Vee offers.</p><p>Agatha is horrified. “Never say that again. Don’t be ridiculous. Good night, you heathens.”</p><p>“Night mom. Love you.”</p><p>“Love you too.” She ruffles his hair and kisses his head. “Night Vee.”</p><p>“Night Agatha.”</p><p>--</p><p>Work is dull. At least her Sunday shifts are only four hours and paid at time and a half. She’s craving coffee by the time she gets home a little after twelve thirty, and when she goes to take the pot to wash it, she stands there blinking, because in place of her old, beat-up, on-its-last-legs generic coffeemaker is a shiny, brand-new Keurig.</p><p>“What the hell is this?” she calls through the house, her heart racing.</p><p>Nicky comes into the kitchen a minute later. “Vee got it for you. She said yours looked decrepit.”</p><p>Agatha leans on the counter for support. “Why did your seventeen-year-old friend buy me a Keurig?”</p><p>“Mom. I just told you why.”</p><p>“But that’s not…” She puts a hand to her forehead. “She has to take it back. I can’t accept this.”</p><p>“She knew you would say that so she smashed the coffee pot and ripped the cord out of your old one before she put it in the dumpster just in case.”</p><p>The noise Agatha makes is despairing. “What?” Her voice is so high pitched she grimaces at herself.</p><p>Nicky grins. “She said she gets three hundred bucks a day from her aunt to do her school work and not set fires in the girls’ bathroom. She had extra left over from yesterday. She said to tell you you’re welcome.”</p><p>Agatha puts her hands over her face. “But I don’t have any K-cups.”</p><p>Nicky chuckles and she hears his footsteps receding. “Check the cabinet.”</p><p>She uncovers her face, afraid to open the cabinet above the Keurig, and when she does, her eyes fill with tears. Boxes and boxes of different flavors of pods are stacked neatly, arranged by brand.</p>

<p>Rio lays there long after Agatha has left. Hours, probably. Until the sun comes up. Pulsing, but empty. Sated, but wanting. Tired, but far too sober.</p><p>Everything feels different with this level of clarity. The banister under her hand feels smooth. The carpet under her feet feels soft. The artwork hanging on her walls feels ostentatious. It feels like someone else’s house, bought with someone else’s money. She’s strangely detached from it as she walks down the stairs and into the kitchen for a drink.</p><p>She doesn’t let herself think about what just happened as she drains an entire bottle of rosé.</p><p>“Shocking,” comes her niece’s voice from somewhere off to the right, and she turns her head to see Valentina doing homework at the kitchen island.</p><p>“Look who’s homeformorethan five—minutes,” she slurs.</p><p>“Why would I want to be here?” Valentina asks. “You’re the worst person I’ve ever met and you treat me like garbage. Worse than garbage, actually, because you acknowledge that garbage exists.”</p><p>“The cleaners takeoutthegarbage,” Rio corrects her, one foot in front of the other as she slowly walks to the living room and opens up one of the magazines to her centerfold spread. The lines are slightly pressed from the weight of the other pages on top of them, so she has to fluff them up a bit before she can partake.</p><p>Valentina follows her. “No, what is literally wrong with you?” she shouts.</p><p>Rio squints up at her from the floor between the couch and the coffee table. “A little bit of everything.”</p><p>“I’m serious!”</p><p>And she watches in horror as Valentina leans over and blows her cocaine off the page.</p><p>Rio shrieks, and everything seems like it’s running in slow motion. Her niece picks up every single magazine and shakes them out before Rio can even get to her feet, before a thought forms in her head to try to stop it.</p><p>“Are you fucking crazy?!” she screams, finally scrambling to her feet and launching herself at her niece, because that is going too far and Rio is going to beat the living hell out of her for it. She’s apparently uncoordinated though because before she can even make contact, Valentina squares up and fucking decks her right in the mouth.</p><p>She flies backward onto the sofa, pain exploding through her jaw and up her cheekbone, and she immediately tastes blood.</p><p>Valentina jumps on her and punches her again, right under her eye, and she holds up her hands in surrender. “All right! Enough! Fuck!” Her face is lit up like a bone is broken, and when the alcohol wears off later it’s going to be absolute tragedy.</p><p>“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Valentina screams, shoving her to get leverage to stand back up, shaking out her hand. “Where’s my three hundred?”</p><p>Rio’s trembling with rage and pain at the same time, and points toward the entry table. “In my purse. Just… take what you want. There’s enough for… whatever.”</p><p>“Don’t think I won’t,” her niece says, breathing hard, brushing her hands off on her shirt and disappearing out of Rio’s line of sight.</p><p>After the door slams she feels her way over to her purse for her cell phone and calls her dealer.</p>

<p>Agatha looks up when Vee comes into the house crying. “What happened?” she asks instantly, rushing over to meet the girl, who throws herself into an embrace.</p><p>“I decked her, I’m sorry!” Vee wails.</p><p>“Oh shit,” Agatha breathes, one hand landing on Valentina’s head to stroke her hair. “It’s okay, we’ll figure it out,” she promises. “I’m sure she deserved it.”</p><p>“She was coming after me because I dusted all of her drugs!”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows shoot up. That was a very dangerous thing for Valentina to do. But she’ll address it when the girl is calm. “Shh, you’re safe here, okay honey? It’s okay.”</p><p>The longer they stand like that, the calmer Valentina gets, and finally she stops crying and wipes her nose with her sleeve.</p><p>“We have tissues,” she says with a grin, but honestly, when she was Vee’s age, she used her sleeve for everything.</p><p>“I’m good,” Vee says, shoving her hands in her pockets and sniffling.</p><p>“So… now that you’re calm, I think we should talk about your choices, if that’s okay with you,” Agatha says carefully.</p><p>“Where’s Nicky?”</p><p>“He’s got a hockey game tonight.”</p><p>Vee nods and takes a seat on the sofa. “I know it was stupid, I just couldn’t take it anymore. It’s all she does, you know? Drink and do coke. I just lost it and shook out all her magazines.”</p><p>Agatha blows out a slow breath and sits down next to her. “She could’ve really hurt you.”</p><p>“I don’t think—”</p><p>“Valentina,” Agatha interrupts gently.</p><p>“Shit.” Vee slumps against the back of the sofa and nods. “Yeah. Okay. She could’ve. I mean I knew she was too drunk, really, she’d just drank an entire bottle of—”</p><p>“Valentina,” Agatha says again, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Vee looks at her, face screwed up. “Yeah?”</p><p>“She could’ve hurt you. People go absolutely apeshit when their drug supply is threatened. It doesn’t matter who’s doing the threatening.”</p><p>“She did go apeshit,” Vee admits. “I’ll give you that.”</p><p>“How many times did you hit her?”</p><p>Vee surreptitiously scoots a few inches away from her. “I punched her in the face twice.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips purse in sympathy for Rio even though she absolutely fucking deserved that. However, Rio is not the issue in question, it’s a lonely, grieving teenage girl that needs guidance. “Did you need to punch her in the face twice to protect yourself?”</p><p>“No. I could’ve just shoved her and she would’ve fallen.”</p><p>“You know actions always have consequences in some way or another, right?” Agatha ventures, chewing one side of her lower lip.</p><p>“Are you mad at me?” Vee looks absolutely stricken.</p><p>“Not at all, honey,” Agatha promises. “But I think you should go to Nicky’s room for a while and think about what could have happened if you were wrong about her abilities when drunk. And no video games tonight. Okay?”</p><p>Vee’s eyes fill with tears, but Agatha doesn’t think it’s because she’s in trouble. She thinks it’s because someone gives a shit about her. “Okay,” she says, and gives Agatha another hug before she gets up and goes off to Nicky’s room.</p><p>--</p><p>By the time Nicky gets home from his hockey game, Vee’s out of his room and has admitted she took a dangerous risk, and has agreed not to play any video games for the night. They talked about what to tell Nicky when he asks why she can’t play Fortnite, and agreed she would tell him the truth about the hitting but not mention the drugs. Not that Agatha thinks he can’t handle knowing that part, but it’s just not a necessary thing to talk about.</p><p>When Vee tells him, he explodes.</p><p>“What?” He turns and looks at Agatha. “Mom, can’t you do something about it? She went after Vee!”</p><p>Agatha would love to do something about it. “I think Vee handled it,” she says, raising an eyebrow. “And I think the best thing to do is for you not to go over there alone anymore,” she says to Valentina.</p><p>“But you work, and I have to get my cash,” Vee says.</p><p>Agatha purses her lips in thought. “Can you get her to CashApp it every morning instead?”</p><p>“I can try, but I doubt she will…”</p><p>She watches as Vee sends a text, sees the frown at Rio’s response.</p><p>“She said she doesn’t have CashApp.”</p><p>“Text me her number.”</p><p>Vee looks hopeful at that, and a second later the shared contact pops up and she saves Rio’s number.</p><p><strong>A: Rio, this is Agatha. Download CashApp right now.</strong></p><p>She doesn’t get a response for a few minutes, and she knows Rio got the text because she’d responded to Vee right away. She’s ready to send a follow up when her phone beeps.</p><p><strong>R: go fckyoursef</strong></p><p>What did she expect, really? She knows from Vee’s account of events that Rio is trashed on an entire bottle of something. She’s surprised the lush got that many letters right, actually.</p><p>She sends a gif of a lighter flicking open and a flame withering on the screen.</p><p><strong>R: ur stupid fiine idid it</strong></p><p>Agatha smirks and sends a voice note.</p><p>“Set up your bank account so you can send Valentina $300 dollars every morning and she doesn’t have to put herself at risk coming by to get your cash.”</p><p><strong>R: she tellu she punchdmynface</strong></p><p><strong>A: She did. And you deserved it. Did you set up the recurring transfer yet?</strong></p><p><strong>R: fuckyo</strong></p><p><strong>A: Did you, Rio? Don’t make me ask again.</strong></p><p><strong>R: Y</strong></p><p><strong>A: Is that a yes?</strong></p><p><strong>R: yesnindid ti</strong></p><p>“Jesus fucking Christ,” she mutters under her breath.</p><p>Nicky eyes her sideways, not used to hearing that kind of language from her, but says nothing about it. “Vee really can’t play Fortnite with me?” he asks instead.</p><p>“She really can’t,” Agatha confirms.</p><p>“But that’s punishing me,” he complains. “And I’m perfect.”</p><p>Vee snorts and nudges him. “You could always shut off the PS5 for one night,” she suggests.</p><p>Agatha’s brain does a good impression of a sports car smashing into a wall. “The what?”</p><p>“There’s better optimization, graphics, streaming speed,” Vee says. “I wanted Nicky to have one. And I took a couple grand out of Aunt Rio’s purse when she said I could take whatever.”</p><p>Agatha gasps. “Vee this has to stop,” she says, eyes wide. “You cannot be buying things for me and Nicky like this.”</p><p>“Then I guess it’s probably not a good time to tell you I threw out your ratty ass lawnmower and got you a ride-on one…”</p><p>“Valentina!” Agatha jumps to her feet. “No more! Okay? No more.”</p><p>“I’m not gonna agree to that, Agatha,” Valentina says. “You said I can’t contribute by paying rent, but you can’t stop me from contributing how I want to.”</p><p>“I absolutely can deactivate your CashApp account,” Agatha threatens. She doesn’t want to have to do that, but she can’t have Valentina going around making household purchases for her house.</p><p>“Why the fuck would you do that?” Vee shouts, and the anguish in her voice makes Agatha feel awful. “She’s got money coming out her fucking ass and you’re struggling working two jobs with broken shit everywhere, letting a whole ‘nother ass person basically live here without asking anything in return, and when she wants to do something to help, you flip your shit and start threatening her? What the <em>fuck</em>, Agatha?”</p><p>“Okay, there’s a lot to unpack there, but Vee, I don’t argue with teenagers the way your aunt does, so please don’t shout and cuss at me. I’ll listen to everything you have to say, I promise. You don’t have to rush it out like that. Can we take a step back?”</p><p>Valentina’s fuming, and Agatha can see her processing the information, clenching and unclenching her hands, eyes tracking something seen only in her mind.</p><p>The girl slowly calms and relaxes her hands. “Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. My bad, I just…” She trails off, looking helplessly at Agatha.</p><p>“It’s okay. Thank you for respecting my boundaries,” Agatha says. “I love that you want to help out, Vee, it’s honestly very touching and sweet and thoughtful of you. But I’m the adult, I’m supposed to be the provider, and having a seventeen-year-old buying lawnmowers and Keurigs makes me feel like I’m a complete failure at being a provider.”</p><p>“Why? She doesn’t need all that money so what’s the difference? You’re not failing at being a provider. You provide everything Nicky needs. I’m getting the stuff that’s extra. The stuff nobody <em>needs</em> but is nice to have.”</p><p>“I—” Agatha stops talking and stares at her, because she’s not wrong. And maybe not wanting Vee to buy stuff for the house is more of a <em>her</em> issue than a real issue. If it makes Valentina feel good, and feel like she’s contributing to a household she wants to be a part of, Agatha should probably overlook her insecurities and just… let it happen. “I guess you’re right,” she finally says. “I didn’t think of it that way. I’m sorry I threatened your CashApp account, I should have thought it through and found a better way to communicate with you.”</p><p>Vee relaxes even more and nods, leaning over to hug her.</p><p>“Let’s make a deal, though. You can only buy things you directly benefit from. Acceptable?”</p><p>“Is that your way of saying it’s now my job to mow the lawn?”</p><p>Agatha snorts out a laugh, peering down at her in the hug. “Yes. Yes it is,” she lies obviously.</p><p>“Deal,” Vee says.</p><p>Now Agatha just has to decide whether to confront Rio or let this one go since Vee already decked her. It’s not an easy choice, really. She doesn’t want to overstimulate, but she really wants that control. Ugh. That is entirely the wrong reason to confront her.</p><p>She shouldn’t go over there again until her motivations are right. She just doesn’t know if she can wait… because there’s a hole in her head the size of a train wrecked rich girl that can only be filled one way.</p><p>--</p><p>She lasts ten minutes. TEN MINUTES. That’s as pathetic as Rio. She’s in the car on her way before she can de-rationalize her behavior.</p><p>There’s no music coming from inside the house, so probably no party, which is odd given it’s early evening.</p><p>When she knocks, she hears Rio’s voice shouting “Go away, I don’t want any!”</p><p>She tries the door anyway, and it swings open. She finds Rio in the living room with a scrawny, pockmarked man – she spread out on the sofa and he knelt over the coffee table cutting up lines.</p><p>Probably her dealer, since Vee had dusted her stash.</p><p>She shoves her hands into her pockets and steps down from the foyer into the living room. “Take a hike,” she tells the dealer.</p><p>Rio groans and rolls her eyes exaggeratedly. “Fuck off, Agatha.”</p><p>The dealer’s on his feet already. “This bitch a problem for you RiRi?”</p><p><em>RiRi? Oh, gaaaaawd</em>.</p><p>“Yeah baby she is,” Rio pouts.</p><p>Agatha throws her a look but doesn’t have time to comment before she’s got a glock leveled at her chest. She can see the safety on but there’s no way Rio would notice that, and she wonders what Rio will do.</p><p>Turns out Rio finds it hilarious. She throws her head back, exposing her pulsing throat as she erupts into cackling laughter. “Shoot her, baby… Make my life easier.”</p><p>“Kinda hard to shoot somebody with the safety on,” Agatha says, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>The dealer grins, and christ he’s got like ten teeth max, and tucks his glock back into his waistband. “Just playin’, girl. Peace.” He flashes her the peace sign and gives Rio a mock salute before bobbing out the door, not bothering to close it behind him.</p><p>“How is it that <em>you</em> still have all your teeth?” she asks Rio, because the burning curiosity is more pressing than her burning anger.</p><p>“Perfect dental hygiene and my very own oral surgeon,” Rio drawls. “What do you want?”</p><p>Agatha ignores the question, her anger now taking precedence. “You were gonna let him shoot me?”</p><p>Rio levels her with a sociopathic stare. “I never said come in, so…” She shrugs. “You’re trespassing.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes and leans down, bracketing her hands on either side of Rio’s head. “You would have let him shoot me?”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flare, and she lifts her chin in defiance, but something in her eyes says the question makes her uncomfortable. “Absolutely.”</p><p>Agatha leans down closer, lips at Rio’s ear. “You’re lying.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>Rio’s lips brush <em>her</em> ear and she rockets upright. This is spiraling fast.</p><p>Rio is sprawled like a rag doll, one leg hanging half off the sofa, her head on the armrest at what cannot be a comfortable angle, and her arms splayed out to her sides. She smells like booze and the faint trace of cigarette smoke, her eye makeup is blurred like she’s been sweating it off, and yet still Agatha wants her.</p><p>“How’s your face, sugar?” she asks to get some distance.</p><p>“Can’t feel a thing,” Rio says with a loud sigh and a languid stretch.</p><p>Agatha feels an unholy rage start bubbling up from the pit of her stomach. She’s had <em>enough</em> of the indifference. So in a move her much younger self would have been proud of but her current self definitely judges her for doing, she swipes Rio’s drugs off the coffee table, sending them up in a cloud of dust.</p><p>There’s an earsplitting howl, and the next thing she knows, she’s dodging the coffee table, which clips her in the arm on its way past and crashes into the wall. She looks behind her in shock, then turns back around just in time to duck a flying lamp. The bulb shatters when it impacts the window behind her, and Agatha grabs Rio by the forearms, forcing her to sit back down on the sofa.</p><p>“Stop!” she shouts as Rio fights the hold, drug-assisted fury fueling her strength.</p><p>But Agatha’s stronger. She keeps Rio seated.</p><p>“Get the fuck out of my house,” Rio snarls.</p><p>“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Agatha asks, winded.</p><p>Rio laughs and clicks her tongue against her teeth. “You forgot your magic wand.”</p><p>“Wh—the tie?” Agatha asks, baffled at that response.</p><p>Rio trills out another laugh, glossy red lips split in an overly giddy grin.</p><p>“You threw a coffee table at me because I didn’t bring my fucking tie?”</p><p>The amusement vanishes. “I threw a coffee table at you because you wasted my drugs. Get out of my house. Now.”</p><p>“I wasted your drugs because you were being a fucking cunt,” Agatha says, still trying to wrap her head around this conversation. She thinks it’s safe to let go of Rio’s arms now, so she does, and steps back.</p><p>“I don’t care why you did it, it’s probably gonna take half an hour to get Jed back here. So you wasted my drugs <em>and</em> my time. Seriously, get out.”</p><p>She’s been told to leave three times now, she really can’t stay. “His name is Jed?” she mutters on her way to the door. It’s still open from when <em>Jed</em> had left. She’s about to step through it when Rio snaps at her.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>“What? You told me to leave.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, since when do you care what I want?”</p><p>“So you’re… not kicking me out of your house?” She should leave anyway. One foot in front of the other, Agatha. Do not engage.</p><p>“Not until you fix my coffee table.”</p><p>Agatha forces down her irritation and leaves the house, shutting the door behind her, and she’s in her car driving off before she sees Rio fling the door open and step out onto the porch, yelling after her.</p><p>She can’t hear the words over the car’s engine, and she doesn’t bother stopping to find out what they are.</p><p>Halfway home her adrenaline has worn off and her arm finally catches her attention. She looks it over at a red light, eyes widening because there’s a tear in her blouse and her arm is bleeding.</p><p>Jesus. She’d barely felt anything when it happened. She’ll have to throw on a jacket to hide it from the kids until she can clean it up.</p>

<p>“Fuckin’ piss me off and make me throw shit and don’t even pick it up!” Rio’s screaming out her front door as Agatha drives away. When the other woman doesn’t stop, she stomps back inside and slams the door, then fixes the coffee table herself and puts all her magazines back on it. She ignores the broken glass for now, because whenever her cleaners are here next they’ll get it. What day even is it? Ugh, who cares.</p><p>And now she can’t even be bothered to get Jed back over because she’s tired and wants a nap, and he’ll take forever and she doesn’t want to wait up.</p><p>She trudges up the stairs and burrows under the blankets in bed, because it’s cold, too, but she doesn’t want to go back downstairs and adjust the thermostat.</p><p>Pouting at the misfortune of the last two days, she drifts off thinking about throwing more furniture at Agatha.</p><p>--</p><p>When she wakes up, it’s dark outside, and she should have set an alarm, because Jed’s not going to come over after dark, he’s got a family or something blah blah blah. And the last time she got blow from somebody else it was cut with way too much other shit, so she’s just gonna have to wait until tomorrow. Fucking figures. Goddamn Agatha. What right does that woman think she has? Barging into Rio’s life demanding things left and right, humiliating her, making her feel things. Making her want things. Making her do things.</p><p>The memories of what Agatha has made her do wash over her and she groans, because now that she knows what it feels like to be affected by someone, she fears she’s hopelessly hooked.</p><p>She should apologize, and maybe Agatha would come back. She’s not actually sorry, but saying sorry might work in her favor?</p><p>Does she really want Agatha to come back, though? Hooked or not, their interactions are very bad for Rio’s self-imposed prison of mental isolation. Her dead black heart beats when Agatha’s in the room, and that’s the most terrifying thing of all. She’s absolutely fucking desperate to ignite that spark while being absolutely fucking desperate to snuff it out.</p><p>She wanders down to get her phone and flops on the sofa, and tries to decide what to say. Maybe if she types it like ‘sry’ it will look like she’s making less effort than she is.</p><p>That’s what she’ll do then.</p><p><strong>R: sry can u come back</strong></p><p>There’s no answer right away, which is annoying, so she takes her phone off of silent and puts it on the coffee table, then picks it up again to order something to eat, and oh shit, she has like how long to get food in the house? She can’t remember when that nosy ass lady was here.</p><p>So after she orders a salad, she puts in a grocery delivery order with a bunch of meat, fruits, and vegetables. None of which she’s likely to eat, and she has no idea what her niece likes to eat, but at least Valentina won’t get taken to foster care and rat her out to the cops.</p><p>She’s halfway through her salad when her phone dings from the other room, and her stomach flips at the thought it might be Agatha responding so she deliberately finishes her food and cleans up before going to check her messages.</p><p><strong>A: Fuck all the way off.</strong></p><p>Rio frowns at the phone.</p><p><strong>R: i said sry</strong></p><p><strong>A: I don’t care what the fuck you said. Don’t text me again, I won’t respond.</strong></p><p><strong>R: thats not nice</strong></p><p>She gets no response.</p><p><strong>R: come over</strong></p><p>No response.</p><p>She chews her lip trying to think up something that will bend the other woman to her will.</p><p><strong>R: plz ill let u boss me arnd</strong></p><p>No response.</p><p><strong>R: do u want me to beg</strong></p><p>No response.</p><p>Frustrated, she tosses down the phone.</p><p>Five minutes later she picks it up again.</p><p><strong>R: why dont you want me</strong></p><p>Agatha still doesn’t respond, and Rio feels invisible. She hates being ignored more than anything else. It sets her back to childhood memories best left buried. She’s an adult now, and she’s much harder to ignore. Except Agatha’s doing a good fucking job of it. If she knew where Agatha lived, she would drive over there right now.</p><p>But she doesn’t.</p><p>So she can’t.</p><p>She can’t do anything but text.</p><p>So she decides to do a lot of that.</p><p><strong>R: fine ill beg</strong></p><p><strong>R: please come over</strong></p><p><strong>R: you wreck me</strong></p><p><strong>R: no ones ever caught my interest b4</strong></p><p><strong>R: i think abt u all the time</strong></p><p><strong>R: i dream abt u</strong></p><p><strong>R: id live on my knees 4 u</strong></p><p><strong>R: jed never shot any1</strong></p><p><strong>R: i knew he wouldnt</strong></p><p><strong>R: i was just mad at u</strong></p><p><strong>R: bc u barged in2 my life and fckd me up</strong></p><p><strong>R: idek what 2 do now</strong></p><p><strong>R: im ruined</strong></p><p><strong>R: i hope ur happy</strong></p><p><strong>R: plz say sthg</strong></p><p>And finally, after exhausting all other avenues of possible reparations, she comes to the conclusion that she’s going to have to give Agatha a real apology.</p><p><strong>R: im sorry i let you think i was going to let him shoot you. i wouldnt have if i thought there was any chance hed do it. please say something agatha im honestly trying so hard right now</strong></p><p>If Agatha doesn’t say something soon, she’s going to lose her fucking mind.</p>

<p>Nicky and Vee both keep looking at her every time her phone goes off. Which happens about five million times in a row. She reads the messages on the lock screen but she’s not even going to unlock the phone. She already said she wasn’t going to respond, so Rio can suck a fucking dick.</p><p>“Oh my God!” Vee finally explodes, throwing her hands up in the air.</p><p>“Seriously mom, who is that? And why aren’t you answering?”</p><p>“It’s someone I told to stop texting me, that’s why I’m not answering,” Agatha mutters. “Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“Can you put it on silent or something? Kind of hard to watch a movie when every other word is ‘DING!’,” Vee complains.</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha says, pulling a face, and flicks down the lever to silence her phone. Not sure why she hadn’t done that sooner. Distracted, maybe.</p><p>“Thank you,” Vee says, rolling her eyes.</p><p>When Rio sends an actual apology, Agatha is torn. She said she wasn’t going to answer, but… Rio seems about to spiral, and maybe it can be an opportunity.</p><p>Biting her lip in indecision, she weighs her options for a few minutes and then unlocks the phone, navigating to the messages.</p><p><strong>A: Rio, I told you to stop texting me. I’m not going to talk to you tonight. You crossed a line and I’m upset with you. If you are still sober tomorrow morning, I will come by before work so we can talk. For tonight, please respect the fact that I don’t want to text anymore.</strong></p><p>She’s still biting her lip as she waits for Rio’s response. Her stomach churning. Because if she’s honest with herself, Rio’s response means more to her than she wants to admit. Is she worth staying sober overnight for? Probably not, so she should prepare herself for Rio to flip out and tell her where she can shove it, but—</p><p><strong>R: ok</strong></p><p>Agatha’s heart skips and she covers her mouth with one hand to hide her sharper-than-usual inhale.</p><p>Of course, Rio could still get shit faced even after agreeing to her terms, but an agreement is at least promising, isn’t it?</p><p>Fuck, she should really be running in the opposite direction.</p><p>But she won’t. She knows she won’t.</p><p>Because she might be just as addicted as Rio.</p><p>--</p><p>At five am, ready to head out the door if Rio’s still coherent, Agatha sends her a text.</p><p><strong>A: Are you still sober?</strong></p><p>It takes a few minutes and she thinks she probably woke Rio up, because the woman is never up before noon.</p><p><strong>R: yes</strong></p><p><strong>A: Prove it. Say something that makes sense.</strong></p><p><strong>R: i usually sleep w my ringer off but i put it on loud so id hear u txt</strong></p><p>Agatha’s heart does a little somersault and she forcibly tells it to stop, brows drawing down in a deep-set frown. Not advisable to get attached as well as addicted. Two very different Pandora’s boxes.</p><p><strong>A: I’m on my way.</strong></p><p><strong>R: ok see u soon</strong></p><p>--</p><p>Agatha knocks on the door and Rio opens it about thirty seconds later – she must’ve been waiting downstairs.</p><p>She looks beautiful, honestly, in a dark blue silk bathrobe with cherry blossoms patterned all over it, hair pulled into a messy bun, bare feet, and a fingernail in her mouth.</p><p>She’s nervous, Agatha realizes. For the first time, she can read a genuine emotion in Rio’s body language that’s not masked by intoxication of some sort.</p><p>“Don’t chew your fingernail,” she says, but Rio keeps doing it and steps back to let her in. She enters the house and after Rio shuts the door behind her, she gently tugs on the other woman’s wrist. “Don’t. Your nails are too pretty to ruin.”</p><p>Rio clasps her hands together and puts them between her thighs, squeezing. “I have to do <em>something</em>, I’m crawling out of my skin.”</p><p>“Well you can start with an apology face to face, and make it good enough to keep me talking.”</p><p>Rio looks surprised, but she apologizes. “I’m sorry I let you think I wouldn’t have stopped him from shooting you,” she says. “And for the things I said when you asked me about it. And—and for telling him it would make my life easier.”</p><p>Agatha nods and walks toward the living room, taking a seat on the sofa, and Rio follows, sitting on the opposite end. Chewing her nail again. “Why did you say those things?”</p><p>Rio talks around the cherry red fingernail. “I was mad.”</p><p>“No, I get that,” Agatha says, resisting the urge to roll her eyes. “But why?”</p><p>“Because like I said last night, you barged into my life and fucked me up,” Rio admits. “Then you just keep walking away and I don’t know… I’m not… I don’t know how to do this.”</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“Feel things,” Rio says, shrugging one shoulder. “Want things.”</p><p>“You don’t want things?” Agatha asks, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“What could I possibly want? I have everything. At least… I thought I had everything. Before you came along and flipped me on my fucking head.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart starts to race a little. “And now?”</p><p>Rio shrugs again. “Now? I guess I know how it feels to crave something besides drugs. Something I can only have in small doses when it suits her.”</p><p>“Do you have any idea why I came over here that first night?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Think.”</p><p>“You came over to tell me how pathetic I am.”</p><p>“But why? Why would I do that? <em>Think</em>, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s forehead wrinkles and her lips purse, and she stops chewing her fingernail. “Because you don’t like me?”</p><p>Agatha scoots closer and puts a finger under Rio’s chin, barely touching. “Why don’t I like you, Rio? What did I know about you before we ever met?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Only whatever Valentina told you.”</p><p>Agatha waits for her to make the connection, and when she does, her frown deepens.</p><p>“You don’t like me because Valentina doesn’t like me?”</p><p>Agatha’s about to blow a gasket. “Rio, stop being so goddamn selfish and only seeing things from one perspective. What would Valentina have told me about you to make me dislike you before ever having met you?”</p><p>“How the fuck would I know what she told you?”</p><p>Rio really has no idea she’s done anything wrong. Agatha has her work cut out for her. “How do you think I felt when she told me you have parties all hours of the night? Strange men in the house with a teenage girl trying to sleep? Or that you order food for yourself and leave her to figure something else out, because there’s nothing to eat in your kitchen? Or that you have drugs littering the coffee table twenty-four hours a day that she could just lean over and sniff if she felt like it? She is seventeen years old, Rio, not twenty-seven. Her parents have just been ripped from her, leaving her grieving and alone. The only person she had before she met Nicky was you. And how did you treat her? What did you do when she came into your home, mourning the loss of the two people she loved most in the world? Did you hug her and tell her it would all be okay? Did you listen to her feelings about her parents? About the change in her life? About how she was uprooted from her friends, from her city, her school, and thrown into the utter chaos that is your home? Did you even look at her, Rio? Did you show her which bedroom she could have? Help her get her possessions into it? Or did you pretend she didn’t exist because you only viewed her as an inconvenience?”</p><p>For a second, one split second, Agatha sees recognition in those wide brown eyes, sees understanding that she’s done wrong, but it disappears like lightning and Rio shoots up off the sofa.</p><p>“I didn’t ask for this!” she shouts.</p><p>Agatha gets up and grabs her by the arms, shaking her. “She didn’t ask for this either,” she says, chasing that spark of humanity. “But you’ve both got it, and only one of you is acting like a spoiled, brain dead asshole.”</p><p>Rio tries to get out of her grip, but when she fails, her eyes fill with tears.</p><p>Agatha jumps on the opportunity. “She just lost her entire world, Rio. Don’t you remember what it feels like to lose something you love?”</p><p>“No,” Rio whispers. “I’ve never loved anything.” A tear slides down her cheek.</p><p>That’s heartbreaking, because Agatha thinks she really means it. She’s thrown off for a second, but regroups. “But you can,” she says almost gently. “You can love her.”</p><p>“I don’t know how.” Another tear escapes and trails down her face.</p><p>“That’s where I come in,” Agatha tells her, letting go of one arm to catch a tear with her thumb and wipe it away. “I can help you.”</p><p>“I’m not gonna just magically be perfect,” Rio says, pulling away.</p><p>Agatha lets her withdraw this time. “You don’t have to be perfect, Rio. I don’t expect you to wake up tomorrow and be sober for the rest of your life. All you have to do is try, little by little. That’s what I can help you do.”</p><p>Rio looks at her, tears continuing to fall. “I am going to fail your every single expectation,” she promises.</p><p>“I’m fairly certain I know how to properly motivate you,” Agatha responds with a quirky grin.</p><p>Rio doesn’t smile. “What’s in it for you?”</p><p>“Besides ensuring Valentina has a loving home in the near future?” She steps up close again, dropping her lips to Rio’s ear. “You’re pretty, Rio,” she purrs.</p><p>She hears the sharp intake of breath that signals Rio is receptive to the answer. “You’re gonna bribe me with sex?”</p><p>“No, sugar,” Agatha drawls, stepping back as she pulls her tie out of her pocket and stretches it between her hands like a rubber band. “With my tie.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes go unfocused.</p><p>“You didn’t think I’d forget it twice, did you?” Agatha teases, lifting it over Rio’s head and settling it around her neck, tightening it up, but running a finger between the band and Rio’s skin to make sure it isn’t <em>too</em> tight.</p><p>Rio stands there and lets her.</p><p>Agatha slowly runs a finger down the front of it, then just as slowly curls her hand around it until she’s clutching it tightly in a fist. She stands like that, staring into Rio’s blown eyes, for several minutes, and then suddenly jerks downward to get Rio on her hands and knees.</p><p>Rio cries out as she lands, head falling forward between her elbows, back arching as she moans. “I would’ve gone down for you,” she gasps.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha tuts. “Don’t question my methods.”</p><p>“Sorry, I just—”</p><p>“Quiet.”</p><p>Rio falls silent.</p><p>“Speak when spoken to.”</p><p>Rio throws her head back so she can look up at Agatha, eyes on fire.</p><p>“Tell me what a bad guardian you’ve been.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks instantly flush and she seems to decide looking at Agatha was a bad idea, because she ducks her head between her arms again. “I’ve been a bad guardian,” she says, her tone lacking any real affect.</p><p>Agatha picks up one of the magazines off the coffee table and rolls it up, then swats Rio on the shoulder with it. “Do better than that. Tell me what you’ve done. And what you haven’t.”</p><p>Rio angles her shoulder away from the swat briefly, then returns to a balanced position. “I didn’t order food for Valentina when I ordered for myself,” she says.</p><p>“And why was that bad?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Because she was probably hungry,” Rio says, and there’s a slight note of misery in her voice now that Agatha regards as progress.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says, her tone clipped. “Next.”</p><p>“I had drugs on the coffee table,” Rio says, for the first time sounding infinitesimally regretful. “That was bad because Valentina is only seventeen and she could’ve taken some.”</p><p>“What might have happened to her if she’d done some of your drugs?” Agatha asks, putting Rio’s thought process to the test on that one.</p><p>There’s no answer for a minute, and then when it comes, Rio’s voice is a little choked. “She could’ve had a bad reaction. Or got addicted. Or—or died.”</p><p>Agatha crouches down in front of her and grabs her by the hair, fingers winding around that messy bun, and lifts her head. “That’s right,” she says. “And that would have been your fault. Do you understand that?”</p><p>Rio whimpers, but answers. “Yes.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says, dropping her head and standing. “Next.”</p><p>“I had parties even after Valentina came to live here, and that was bad because that meant strange men in the house with a teenage girl, and loud music while she was trying to sleep for school,” Rio says, her voice gaining more affect with each subsequent confession.</p><p>“What might have happened to her if she didn’t go out and buy herself a lock for her bedroom door?” Agatha asks.</p><p>Rio’s head drops lower as her shoulders sag. “She could’ve been assaulted. And that would have been my fault.”</p><p>Rio is a quick learner, Agatha thinks. “Good girl. Next.”</p><p>“I didn’t tell her everything would be okay,” Rio says, and it’s a whisper. “That was bad because she just lost her parents and she was depending on me to help her feel less alone, and I didn’t. I didn’t do anything.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says. “Anything else you can think of?”</p><p>“I didn’t get up to take her to school in the mornings. I don’t even know how she’s been getting there. That’s bad because… if she has to walk anywhere it might not be safe.”</p><p>Agatha’s impressed with that one, because it wasn’t something she had mentioned in her earlier tirade. Rio came up with that on her own. “Good girl,” she says, and this time she lets a note of pride into her voice. She can tell that Rio hears the difference because her back stiffens. She’s gotten through the important part. Now for the fun part. “Tell me <em>why</em> you did nothing to help your niece.”</p><p>Rio understands instantly, her head picking up, wild eyes finding Agatha’s. “Because I’m selfish.”</p><p>Agatha can see the shudder wrack her body. “Mm. What else are you, Rio?”</p><p>“I’m spoiled,” Rio says, breathing hard.</p><p>“Come on, you can do better than that. What else are you, Rio?”</p><p>“I’m pathetic,” Rio moans softly. “A self-centered slut.”</p><p>“Oh yes, you are,” Agatha agrees, starting to walk a slow circle around her. She stops directly behind Rio. “What else?”</p><p>“I’m a—a drug-addled waste of space,” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha steps forward and sits carefully on Rio’s back, keeping most of her weight on her feet, letting just enough of her body mass settle to make the girl feel <em>ridden</em>, and reaches down in front of her to grab the tie, pulling it up to choke her a little.</p><p>Rio cries out and rears her head back, but she does nothing to attempt escape.</p><p>“You are all of those things,” Agatha says, “but you <em>will</em> do better.”</p><p>Rio whines and pulls forward with her throat to make Agatha choke her harder.</p><p>Agatha lets go of the tie and grabs Rio’s hair instead. “Say it,” she hisses.</p><p>“I’ll do better,” Rio splutters, coughing.</p><p>“You have five seconds to make me believe it or I’ll choke you out entirely and walk out that door.”</p><p>Rio’s still coughing but she scrambles to obey, her fingers digging into the carpet. “I will, I’ll do better,” she rasps out, sucking in air. “I promise I’ll do better, I promise!”</p><p>Agatha believes her. She climbs off of Rio’s back and stands in front of her. “Put the tie in your mouth and crawl up the stairs.”</p><p>Rio’s shaking so badly she almost can’t comply, but Agatha is patient, waiting to walk away until the tie is between those perfect teeth, and then walks behind Rio as she crawls.</p><p>She knows exactly what she wants from upstairs, and when they reach the top, she grabs Rio’s hips to stop her.</p><p>“Wait there,” she says, and goes into Rio’s bedroom, over to the vanity, and picks up a very ornate, very <em>heavy</em> antique silver hairbrush. The kind with soft bristles, that Rio probably only uses after her hair is already brushed, to shine it.</p><p>That thought makes her wonder more about Rio’s daily routines. Does she sit at the vanity and brush her gorgeous hair? Does she do her makeup here? What time does she wake up, and is it to an alarm or does she just sleep until she wakes up naturally?</p><p>She runs her fingers over the designs on the back of the brush, biting her lip, because this is going to hurt Rio.</p><p>She goes to the doorway and motions Rio over, and watches Rio crawl toward her, teeth still gritted on the tie. So very obedient with her training totem in place.</p><p>“Rewards and consequences,” she says when Rio stops in front of her. She leans down and drags her finger over the part of the tie that’s not between clenched teeth. “Rewards.” She stands up and traces a fingertip over the back of the hairbrush. “Consequences.”</p><p>Rio makes a noise like an angry bull, nostrils flaring, but she doesn’t relinquish her hold on the tie to speak. Her eyes are wide and she shakes her head.</p><p>Whether it’s an actual protest or a token one, Agatha doesn’t know, nor does she care. “Yes,” she says in response either way. She drags the vanity chair into the middle of the bedroom and sits, patting her thighs.</p><p>Rio crawls a few paces closer but stops and shakes her head again.</p><p>“Don’t make me tell you three times, sugar.”</p><p>Rio whines and crawls closer, then climbs over her lap.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha whispers, running a hand up the back of Rio’s thighs, pulling the silk robe up with it.</p><p>Rio puts her hands on the floor to balance, and Agatha drags her thong down her legs, letting it rest around her knees.</p><p>The sound Rio makes is… decadent. And the smell of her arousal is even more decadent than that. It’s hard not to tell her how good she smells. It’s making Agatha’s mouth water. “You’re so wet, aren’t you?” she croons. “About to be punished… you like that, Rio?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head and Agatha laughs.</p><p>“No? No you’re not wet, or no you don’t like the fact that I’m about to light your ass up like the fourth of July?”</p><p>Rio whines and squirms on her lap, and it’s the most delicious combination of things.</p><p>“Would it help if I told you I’m wet too, sugar?”</p><p>Rio groans and the tie slips out of her mouth. “Agatha, please, god, I don’t even know—”</p><p>“You want me to leave?”</p><p>“No,” Rio says, almost a shout. “I just—I—ugh!”</p><p>Apparently she doesn’t know what she ‘just’ because she stops talking.</p><p>“You just what?” Agatha prompts, rubbing a hand over Rio’s bare ass.</p><p>Rio shivers and turns her head to look up at Agatha over her shoulder. “I just don’t want you to see me like this,” she huffs, dropping her head back down.</p><p>“Like what?” Agatha asks, nonplussed. Of all the things…? This is the one she objects to?</p><p>“Like… I don’t know, immature or something! I’m draped over your lap like a kid!”</p><p>Agatha throws her head back and laughs. “Your position over my lap is not the thing that makes me see you as immature,” she promises. “You’ve done that with your words and actions since the moment we met.” She lets that sink in for a minute and then continues. “And I assure you, the punishment you are about to get will be entirely adult in nature.”</p><p>Rio just whines.</p><p>“Now, if you’re done stalling, get the tie back in your mouth so I can proceed.”</p><p>The weight on her thighs increases for a bit while Rio picks her hands up off the floor and balances, getting the tie back between her teeth. Then she settles back down, and Agatha picks up the hairbrush from where she’d set it half underneath herself.</p><p>She lets Rio adjust to what’s coming for a marginal amount of seconds, then raises her arm and cracks the hairbrush soundly across Rio’s left cheek.</p><p>Rio’s shocked, pained yelp is music to her ears. Her ass is flawless and buoyant and the hairbrush would bounce right off if it was lighter, but the heavy silver it’s made of allows it to make an impact and stay put.</p><p>When she’s ready, she lifts it from Rio’s backside, her heart racing at the intricate pattern raised in red on Rio’s skin. It’s like a gothic interpretation of a fleur-de-lis.</p><p>Stifling a groan, Agatha raises her arm again and brings the hairbrush down sharply on Rio’s other cheek, the crack resounding in her ears like a shot.</p><p>Rio howls, the tie tumbling out of her mouth, and Agatha spanks her again in the same spot. Harder.</p><p>“Get that tie back in your fucking mouth,” she scolds, and Rio’s frantic to comply, breath heaving, whimpers trailing after the initial howling yell, and she gets the tie back in her mouth, dropping down again. “Every time that tie comes out I add ten,” Agatha snaps.</p><p>Rio vehemently shakes her head.</p><p>Agatha raises her arm and delivers another stinging blow, the fleur-de-lis-shaped welts overlapping each other, turning Rio’s smooth skin into a beautiful mess of red lines and curves.</p><p>Rio screams the best she can with her teeth gritted, and Agatha lays into her now, one after another after another, crisp and heavy and relentless, paying close attention to Rio’s breathing underneath the screams.</p><p>When Rio is sobbing too loudly for Agatha to gauge her breathing, she stops and sets the hairbrush on the floor. Some of the welts are underlaid by forming bruises, glaring and purple and mottled, and it will be hell on earth to sit down for the rest of the day.</p><p>She puts her hand under the robe to rub Rio’s back, and when the more violent sobs die down, the other woman is still a miserable, crying, squirming wreck.</p><p>Agatha is patient, as always, and lets her cry for as long as she needs to, just rubbing up and down her back. It takes a very long time for Rio to go still and quiet. Long enough that Agatha’s ass is numb from sitting in the same position.</p><p>When Rio stops squirming and crying, Agatha speaks softly to her. “Can you stand?”</p><p>“I don’t—know,” Rio stammers. “Maybe—maybe if you help me.”</p><p>Agatha puts her arms around Rio to lift her and helps her to her feet. Rio’s panties slide the rest of the way down and she carefully steps out of them, her face twisted with discomfort as she moves her legs.</p><p>Her face is a mess. Mascara’s bleeding all the way down to her jaw, her eyes are red and puffy, and some hair that fell out of her bun is plastered to her forehead with sweat.</p><p>Agatha brushes the hair off of her forehead and guides her toward the bed with a hand on her lower back. “Take off your robe baby and up on your stomach.”</p>

<p>Rio stumbles and falls forward over the bed when Agatha calls her baby. She can feel the tension behind her, because she doesn’t think Agatha meant to say it. And she doesn’t want anything to ruin the moment so she pretends she didn’t notice. “On—on my stomach?” she says, just to have something to say, and crawls carefully onto the bed.</p><p>But her head is spinning. No one has ever called her that. Never came close. It fills her with the sharpest anxiety at the same time it blankets her with the most comforting warmth she can imagine. And then there’s a tinge of excitement thrown in.</p><p>She lays on her stomach, shaking, her ass throbbing like a nuclear test site and stinging like it’s on literal fire. Her heartbeat is pounding in her ears and every nerve is a live wire.</p><p>“Take your robe off,” Agatha says again, and Rio pulls one arm out of the sleeve, then tosses it over her back so she can slide it off of her other arm.</p><p>She feels the mattress dip beside her and then Agatha is stretched out, propped on her side, up on one elbow.</p><p>Every breath makes the pain radiate outward from her abused ass, and every few breaths she can’t fight off a pained shudder.</p><p>“You don’t have to be perfect,” Agatha tells her, and she feels a hand on her back, rubbing again, slowly up and down. She tries to relax into it. “But you are going to do better, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says, her voice hoarse and scratchy. She can’t remember the last time she cried like that. If she ever has. She knows she won’t meet Agatha’s expectations but she will try to do better. Although from the sound of Agatha’s earlier scolding, she’s got nowhere to go but up.</p><p>“You were very good for your consequences,” Agatha says after a few minutes of silence, and Rio’s breath catches, a tiny moan filtering out.</p><p>She will never understand why Agatha calling her good affects her so deeply, but it does. It reaches into parts of her she’s never experienced and didn’t know existed and turns them on like the flip of a switch. “I tried,” she croaks.</p><p>“You did,” Agatha repeats, and the hand on her back slides higher and eases into her hair, and oh god that feels divine. “You didn’t try to get up, not once. I know how hard that must have been. I know how much that spanking hurt.”</p><p>Rio’s face goes hot at the word ‘spanking’, embarrassment flooding her body, and she closes her eyes against it. “Can you call it a beating or something?” she asks, with no real hope that Agatha will honor the request.</p><p>But to her surprise, Agatha doesn’t laugh it off or refuse. “It was more of a beating, wasn’t it? Well, either way, I know how much it hurt, but you laid there and took it like a good girl, didn’t you?”</p><p>Oh. She’s supposed to participate in this praise? That’s new. She’s used to participating in her own degradation, but… yeah, this is new. She tries it out on her tongue. “Yes, I—I did,” she says hesitantly. It feels strange, but overwhelmingly nice.</p><p>“Do you like having your hair played with?”</p><p>“No one ever has, but so far, yes, very much.”</p><p>“Can I take out the bun?”</p><p>“<em>That</em> you ask permission for?”</p><p>Her eyes are still closed but she hears Agatha’s laugh and then her hair is loose, falling over her neck and back.</p><p>She nearly purrs when Agatha starts running her fingers through it. It feels especially good when a knot gets caught and Agatha has to tug the slightest bit to get past.</p><p>“I’m not going to be able to sit down,” Rio says when her attention is drawn back to the pulsing fire in her ass.</p><p>“No, you’re not,” Agatha agrees, still playing with her hair.</p><p>“How am I supposed to do anything?”</p><p>“Lay down, stand up, or kneel,” Agatha suggests. “I’m sure you’ll manage.”</p><p>Rio means to never bring it up, ever, ever, ever, because she doesn’t want Agatha to run out the door, but the question bubbles up so effervescently in her chest that she literally can’t contain it and it comes spilling out in a rush. “You didn’t mean to call me baby, did you?”</p>

<p>Agatha freezes with her hand in Rio’s hair. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fu—“No I didn’t,” she admits, her face going clammy. Why did Rio have to notice that? It was a slip-up better left ignored, not reflected upon, and <em>certainly</em> not discussed out loud. “I’m sorry if it freaked you out, I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again. I’m just so used to saying it to—” <em>Stop talking, Agatha. She already expressed she doesn’t want to be viewed as a child, and if you say you’re used to saying it to the kids and that’s why you said it to her, she’s going to be humiliated in the not-fun way and possibly withdraw, which is the last thing you want</em>. “—my cat,” she finishes the sentence. She doesn’t have a fucking cat.</p><p>Rio opens her eyes, and Agatha swears she sees disappointment flicker past. “What’s your cat’s name?”</p><p><em>Great, now you have to make up a whole-ass fake cat</em>. “Joshua.” She says the first name that comes to mind. <em>Joshua?</em> <em>Jesus Christ, Harkness</em>.</p><p>“Your cat is named Joshua?”</p><p>Rio’s tongue is pressed into her cheek, and Agatha can’t tell if it’s just amusement or if it’s Rio not buying her bullshit.</p><p>“I call him Josh for short but Nicky has to be extra and calls him Shua.”</p><p>At the mention of Nicky, Rio turns her face away.</p><p>“What’s that for?” she asks, scratching lightly over Rio’s scalp.</p><p>“You’re a good mom and I’m—” She shrugs and doesn’t finish her sentence.</p><p>“The shittiest guardian on the planet?” Agatha finishes for her. “You’re going to do better, remember?”</p><p>Rio nods but doesn’t turn back to face her. “How do I do better?”</p><p>“By changing one small thing at a time,” Agatha says. “The first thing you’re going to do is keep your drugs hidden in your own bathroom, far away from Vee. Never in the open.”</p><p>That gets Rio facing her with wide eyes. “You’re not going to demand that I stop using altogether?”</p><p>“One small thing at a time,” Agatha says. “Too much at once would end up overwhelming you and causing more setbacks than progress. Keep your drugs away from her at all times, understand?”</p><p>Rio still looks a bit shellshocked, but she nods her understanding and agreement. “Okay. Yeah.”</p><p>“Did you stock the kitchen yet for CYS?”</p><p>“I got a grocery delivery,” Rio says, and her brow furrows. “Was it you that called them?”</p><p>Agatha’s not going to lie about that. “Me and Principal Rooks both called,” she says.</p><p>It stings a little when Rio turns her head away again. “Oh,” she says, flat.</p><p>“I’m not going to apologize for putting Valentina’s needs ahead of anything else,” Agatha says, but she says it as gently as she can.</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting an apology,” Rio says. “I’m realizing that I’m horrible.”</p><p>“Someday I want to hear what made you so horrible,” Agatha says, running her fingers through Rio’s hair again and letting the strands fall freely. “But right now, I just want you to relax and breathe. You were very good for me, Rio, and I want you to feel good about that.”</p><p>Rio hums at the attention to her hair and nods at Agatha’s words. “Okay.” And a second later she adds, “I like hearing you say that.”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip to fight off her more feral urges and keeps it soft. “You like hearing me say you were good?” she says, voice low, mouth hovering a few inches above Rio’s ear.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says with a shiver.</p><p>“You were so good,” Agatha whispers, lightly squeezing a handful of Rio’s hair. “So fucking good, laying over my lap, taking your beating. Weren’t you?”</p><p>Rio moans, turning her face to press into the mattress. “Yes,” she says, muffled by the comforter.</p><p>“And you felt so good on my thighs,” Agatha purrs. “Like you belonged there. Like it was second nature to be draped across my knee…”</p><p>Rio moans again, grabbing handfuls of the comforter. “Please, please,” she begs. “Please touch me, Agatha, I’ve never wanted anyone like this in my life…”</p><p>“I can’t do that, sugar,” Agatha says regretfully, and the regret is absolutely fucking genuine because what she wouldn’t give to bury her fingers or her tongue in Rio’s cunt.</p><p>Rio sounds on the verge of tears. “Ever?” she asks, and it hits Agatha in the chest as well as her pussy.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha says, and it’s honest, because as much as she wants it, if she ever gives in, Rio might stop being interested. And that would devastate her on a level she’s not prepared to admit, in addition to how awful it would probably end up for Valentina.</p><p>“Why?” Rio asks, and it’s so simple a question with such a labyrinth surrounding the answer.</p><p>What can she say to appease Rio and still keep herself protected? “Because if I give you everything, what’s left to want?”</p><p>Rio gasps and pushes up onto her hands and knees so she can stare at Agatha. “You think throwing gasoline on this fire will kill it?” Her eyes are wild. “You’re forgetting something.”</p><p>“What am I forgetting?” Agatha raises her eyebrows, curious despite herself.</p><p>The look on Rio’s face can only be described as sinfully awestruck. “That I’m a fucking <em>addict</em>.”</p><p>By that logic, Agatha’s finding it harder and harder not to give in. “Rio,” she says, drawing a thumb over one pebbled nipple that’s hovering dangerously close to her face. “I can’t.”</p><p>Rio lets out a cry and throws her head back. “Fuck! Fuck, please, <em>please</em>,” she keeps begging, and Agatha’s resistance is starting to chip away.</p><p>“It’s too risky,” she breathes, sitting up, placing a hand between Rio’s shoulder blades to force her back onto her stomach.</p><p>Rio goes without resistance but makes a haunting promise. “I will be addicted to you until the day I die. Maybe even after that.”</p><p><em>Jesus Christ</em>. “I’m not ready to let you feel my tongue or my fingers inside you,” she says. “Do you have any toys?”</p><p>Rio groans. “My closet is full of them.”</p><p>Agatha slides off the bed and goes into the walk-in closet, and she’s met with what she can only label as a sex toy museum. “What the fuck?”</p><p>“I like toys,” Rio says from the bed.</p><p>“So much you didn’t leave any for anyone else, apparently.” They’re even displayed on shelves and racks that look like they came from an actual sex shop.</p><p>“Addict,” Rio calls.</p><p>“Indeed.” She notes they’re arranged by type, then size, and picks a pink vibrator that’s about six inches. She returns to the bed, holding it up, and Rio licks her lips. “Your level of desperation has dropped,” she says, observing Rio’s relaxed body language. “We’ll need to fix that before I even think about touching you with this.”</p><p>“Fix that?” Rio asks.</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha nods. She climbs on the bed on her knees. “Is this clean?”</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>“You clean your sex toys but not your toilet? Because if you tell me your cleaning service cleans your sex toys I’m fucking leaving this house right now.”</p><p>“I clean them!” Rio blurts out, her cheeks flushing pink.</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I don’t trust your ability to clean or sanitize. Explain how you clean your sex toys.”</p><p>Rio stares at her in disbelief, stuttering over herself, and it takes a minute for her to be able to get out actual words. “I use cleaner from the boutique I buy the toys from,” she says.</p><p>“Do you actually research what cleaners are best or do you just point and click?”</p><p>Rio squirms a little. “I shop in person, actually, and the clerks show me which cleaners to get.”</p><p>Agatha pulls one of Rio’s arms out from under her and presses the vibrator into her hand. “Show me how you clean it. What motions you use. Do you scrub it or just dunk it in cleaner? What do you use, a rag, paper towels, or a scrub brush? Or just your hands?”</p><p>Rio continues to stare in disbelief as she answers. “I—I scrub them with a brush,” she says.</p><p>“Get up on your knees so you can use both hands, and show me. Pretend you’re holding the brush.”</p><p>Rio looks like there’s nothing she wants to do less, but she gets on her knees and pretends to scrub the vibrator.</p><p>Agatha’s satisfied and grabs it back, but can’t resist saying “you missed a spot.”</p><p>Rio’s just gaping at her.</p><p>“Get back down.”</p><p>Rio settles on her stomach and Agatha takes a moment to appreciate the swirling curving red lines and purple bruises on her tempting ass. She can’t go near that now but she will at some point, she’s certain.</p><p>“Now, what to do with you? Praise you? Or humiliate you? I wonder which would make you wetter.”</p><p>Rio’s disbelief slowly morphs into more of an awestruck gaze.</p><p>“Which is more powerful, sugar? Praise or humiliation?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen and her tongue slides out to wet her lips. “I don’t know,” she breathes. “No one’s ever done either except for you.”</p><p>Maybe she’ll mix it up, then. “No? No one’s ever told you what a good girl you are for being such a little whore?”</p><p>She brings the vibrator up to her mouth and extends her tongue for a slow, teasing lick around the tip.</p><p>Rio’s jaw drops, and Agatha can see her breathing pick up in the way her back rises and falls, muscles rippling under her shoulder blades.</p><p>“You’re so pretty, Rio,” she purrs, running her free hand through Rio’s hair and tracing patterns down the back of her neck with one fingernail. “It’s too bad your beauty is wasted on someone so… fucking… hopeless.”</p><p>Rio moans, eyelids fluttering.</p><p>“You’re such a train wreck, aren’t you, sugar? One look from me and you’re on your stomach, gagging on my tie while you fuck yourself because no one else can stand to touch you…” She sucks the head of the vibrator into her mouth and lets it out with a pop.</p><p>Rio’s whining now, gripping the comforter, squirming constantly.</p><p>Agatha turns on the motor and runs it down Rio’s spine, enjoying the way she jerks in surprise and holds her breath.</p><p>“Are you going to be good for me, Rio?” she asks in her best condescending stripper voice.</p><p>Rio nods tersely.</p><p>“I don’t believe you.”</p><p>Panic starts to set in to those wide brown eyes and Agatha soaks it up like a dehydrated sapling.</p><p>“I’ll be good,” Rio says.</p><p>“I still don’t believe you,” Agatha tuts. “Maybe I should just leave.”</p><p>Rio starts shaking and her eyes fill with tears. “Please,” she whispers. “I’ll be good, Agatha, I’ll be good for you, I swear I will…”</p><p>It shouldn’t light Agatha’s nerves on fire, but it does. The begging really does. “There’s just one problem, sugar. If I use this from behind, my arm’s going to bump into your ass with every thrust, and we can’t have that. And you certainly can’t lay on your back, so what do we do, hmm?”</p><p>“I’ll do anything you say,” Rio promises. “Anything, just touch me, please.”</p><p>She’s desperate enough now, and Agatha slides backward off the bed. “We’ll have to try it standing, won’t we?”</p><p>Rio is off the bed in an instant, wobbling on shaky legs, but with no obvious thought in her head of protesting.</p><p>Agatha goes to the middle of the room. “Come here.”</p><p>Rio shuffles over, slowly, and it’s clear that walking hurts her abused backside, but she doesn’t complain.</p><p>When she’s close enough, Agatha reaches her free hand up into that dark messy hair and grips a handful at the base of her neck to guide Rio’s head to her chest, so they’re standing front pressed to front, and drops the hand with the vibrator, which is still on its lowest setting, threatening to make her hand numb if she doesn’t give the vibrations somewhere else to focus their pulsing.</p><p>She runs the vibrator up the inside of Rio’s thighs to get her to open up, and Rio shifts her stance to make room.</p><p>“Where can I put my hands?” Rio whispers against her chest.</p><p>“Mmm, good girl,” Agatha nearly moans at the question. “Just for that, you can put them on my waist.”</p><p>Hands immediately find her waist, resting there without pressure.</p><p>“Well?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“What?” Rio breathes.</p><p>“What do you say when someone does you a favor?”</p><p>Rio mewls and presses her face harder into Agatha’s chest, hips pressing forward. “Thank you,” she says, voice muffled.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Agatha says with a patronizing chuckle. “So obedient when you want to get fucked, aren’t you, Rio?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says. She’s still shaking, Agatha can feel it everywhere they’re touching. It has to be hard for her to stand up, but she’s clearly willing to endure it just to be touched with a piece of vibrating plastic that’s not held in her own hand.</p><p>“I don’t know if you’re wet enough to take this,” she hums, tapping the toy against Rio’s leg.</p><p>“I am,” Rio whimpers. “Please, I’m wet enough.”</p><p>“Nah, I’d better get it nice and slippery first. Wouldn’t want to hurt you,” Agatha says with a snicker. “Undo my belt, sugar.”</p><p>Rio’s knees buckle and Agatha has to shoot an arm around her to hold her up.</p><p>“Calm down,” she scolds. “I asked you to undo my belt, not cryogenically freeze yourself.”</p><p>Rio whimpers again and finds her footing so Agatha can unwrap her arm, and trembling hands fumble with her belt buckle, taking twice as long as it should to get it undone.</p><p>“Button and zipper, then put your hands back on my waist,” Agatha orders.</p><p>Rio lowers the zipper but she can’t get the button, she’s too tremulous. “It won’t,” she cries out.</p><p>“Then just pull it,” Agatha says, giving her permission to break it. She’s not that fond of these pants anyway.</p><p>Rio pulls, and the button flies off, and then hands are back on her waist, squeezing a little tighter than before, but she allows it because she knows Rio needs help standing.</p><p>“Good girl, Rio,” she says, letting that tiny note of affection into her voice just for a moment, and the responding little moan is delicious.</p><p>Agatha shoves the vibrator down the front of her pants, under the band of her underwear, and eases it inside herself with zero difficulty. She’s fucking soaked.</p><p>When Rio realizes what she’s doing, she goes insane. “Oh my god, oh my fucking god, what are you doing?” Rio pants, clutching her waist even tighter, to the point of pain. “What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? You’re—you’re gonna—that—that—that—”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha says smoothly, and Rio abruptly stops talking.</p><p>She slides the vibrator out of herself and puts it between Rio’s legs, rubbing the tip back and forth through her folds, and when she can feel it line up properly she gives one smooth thrust and seats it all the way inside.</p><p>Rio screams against her chest, nails digging into her waist, and oh, Agatha is definitely just as addicted to this hot mess as Rio is to her.</p><p>“You’re gagging for it and I’m not even touching you,” Agatha breathes in the girl’s ear. “It’s just a piece of plastic. Not even my fingers. No skin to skin contact at all, and you’re going fucking crazy, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio moans and whines and grinds down on the toy. “Yes,” she wheezes.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha agrees, and she has a feeling that if she wasn’t holding Rio’s head to her chest, she’d be getting bitten somewhere, and Rio wouldn’t even be able to help it. That’s part of the reason she chose this position – so she wouldn’t risk Rio’s mouth roaming free while she’s distracted and end up with teeth in her neck or shoulder. The other reason is because standing in the middle of the room, holding the girl against her is soft and sweet and an exact counterpoint to the words she utters and the frantic pace she’s keeping between Rio’s legs. “Say it, Rio.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t hesitate. “I’m gagging for it and you’re not even touching me,” she gasps out, her hips continuing to seek stimulation even as Agatha’s thrusting pretty goddamn hard.</p><p>“Such a good little bitch,” Agatha praises the quick compliance, and Rio clenches on the toy, shuddering in her arms, clawing the ever-loving fuck out of her waist.</p><p>But she manages to stay standing, even if she seems about to fully collapse.</p><p>“If I ever put my hands or mouth on you,” Agatha threatens as Rio’s still coming down from her peak, “you will not come until I give you permission, do you hear me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are dazed when Agatha pulls her head back to look at her. Glassy. Gone.</p><p>She slides the vibrator out and tosses it on the bed, then guides Rio over with the hand in her hair. “Up,” she says. “Before you collapse.”</p><p>Rio crawls onto the bed and her arms give out, and Agatha catches her by the shoulders to ease her down.</p><p>“There you go,” she croons. “So pretty, aren’t you?” She brushes the sweaty hair back from Rio’s forehead and stretches out beside her, propped up on an elbow like earlier. “Such a pretty girl. Such a good girl for me, sugar,” she says, drawing her thumb down the side of Rio’s face, helping ground her and bring her back from the headspace she’s descended into.</p><p>Agatha’s not sure how she’s meant to work after this, but that’s her own fault. A quick glance at Rio’s nightstand clock tells her she has about forty-five minutes before she needs to leave.</p><p>Rio rolls on her side facing Agatha, a grimace on her lips as she moves, and reaches out.</p><p>Agatha’s heart starts thudding against her bones, creating a cacophonous disaster in her ears. She had not anticipated this. What is she supposed to do? That’s not what this is supposed to be. But on the other hand, she quite literally blistered Rio’s ass, so she has a responsibility to provide aftercare no matter what their relationship is meant to be.</p><p>She lays on her back and lets Rio snuggle up against her side, and puts an arm under her neck, bending at the elbow to hold her a little. She knows the girl has to be in a tremendous amount of pain, but not once does Rio complain or protest. She just lays there, silent, picking at the collar of Agatha’s blouse with one hand.</p><p>After about fifteen minutes, Agatha can’t take the silence. “What are you thinking?” she asks softly.</p><p>Rio blinks and looks up at her for a second before laying her head back down. She still hasn’t stopped picking at Agatha’s collar. “I’m thinking about how my life is suddenly on hold.”</p><p>Agatha tries not to stiffen at that, but has no idea whether she succeeds, and Rio gives no indication she’s noticed anything. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I can’t go on like I was,” Rio says, picking a little harder at the collar. “And I can’t have you move in. So I’m stuck in limbo. Every decision I make is going to depend on whether you’re giving me the time of day.”</p><p>Agatha should be thrilled to hear that, because isn’t that what she wanted? A way to control Rio to make things better for Valentina?</p><p>So why does it feel wrong? She needs to think very carefully about how to respond before she opens her mouth. Half of her wants to dismiss the concern and just move forward anyway. The other half tries to choke her out for thinking that. Somehow this absolute fucking shit show of a woman has managed to make her feel guilty. “Rio, I…” But she doesn’t know what to say.</p><p>“You asked what I was thinking,” Rio snaps.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha says placatingly. “I know. I didn’t expect you to be… to be…”</p><p>“To be human?” Rio asks bitterly. “Yeah, neither did I.”</p>
