<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio stared at her quietly, slowly tapping her foot against the tiled floor. A wrinkle formed between her eyebrows from thinking about Agatha's predicament, and the lawyer sighed, waving her hand dismissively.<br/>"Stop trying to find a solution to this. It will give you a stroke."<br/>"Marry me," Agatha was glad she had finished her drink because she would spill it all over the bar at the words. She blinked to regain her composure, her mind scrambling for a teasing remark to fire back at Rio, but her tongue could only form one word.<br/>"What?"<br/>"I'm not a stranger from Craigslist, and I know probably most psychopaths would say that, but I'm not a psychopath. So, marry me."<br/>---<br/>Agatha learns about a clause in her mother's will that makes her unable to inherit Evanora's fortune unless she gets married by forty. While drowning her sorrows at a bar, she meets Rio, a PhD student working behind the bar to make ends meet, who proposes an insane solution to her problem. Or rather, proposes to Agatha.<br/>Everything spirals out of control after that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>A fake marriage AU because there are not enough in this fandom. Also, because I wanted to write it.<br/>Fair warning: this is going to be a slow burn (I know it's in the tags, but it's going to be sloooow because these two are impossible). The rating and tags may also change, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.<br/>Enjoy!</p></blockquote>

<p>Agatha braced her elbows on the bar as she shifted in the worn stool. The alcohol flowing steadily through her system eased some of the tension in her muscles, born both from sitting at the bar for too long and the reason behind her presence at the dingy place, but she knew she would feel sore in the morning. With the swelling pain she could feel pushing at her skull, Agatha was glad Wanda offered to drop Nicky off after lunch, and not breakfast.</p><p>"How are we doing here?" she looked up from the empty glass she was mindlessly fiddling with and silently cursed Jen for dragging her to the bar, only to ditch her for a work emergency after one drink. It did not stop Agatha from having another two in hopes of washing away the sinking feeling of inevitable doom looming over her. Now, the bartender was looking at her like she were a charity case - a pitiful sight that made people think their life was not so bad.</p><p>How the mighty have fallen.</p><p>"Splendid," she grunted, pushing her glass forward. "I'll take another one."</p><p>The bartender caught it before it could slide off the counter and quirked her eyebrow. The gesture drew Agatha’s attention to the rest of the woman’s face, and she found herself admiring the sharp jawline, high cheekbones, and smart, warm eyes lustrating her curiously. "Rough day?"</p><p>"Didn't your friend tell you I don't partake in small talk?" Agatha nodded toward the other woman standing behind the bar, visibly preparing to clock out.</p><p>"I don't make assumptions," the bartender shrugged, swirling the bottle of whiskey around before expertly filling the glass. "Just because you didn't talk to Alice doesn't mean you won't talk to me."</p><p>"Why? Because you're special?" Agatha chuckled dryly, her eyes mindlessly following the bartender's movements. She could see a hint of a tattoo peeking out from under the t-shirt's sleeve, grazing the upper part of a toned biceps. She swallowed thickly at the sight, forcing herself to focus on the bartender's face. The woman smirked at her knowingly, pushing the glass back between Agatha's hands. The ice cubes rattled when Agatha lifted it to her lips, taking a small sip and sighing at the burn of whiskey on her tongue.</p><p>"Because I'm a good listener," the bartender answered confidently. "I'm Rio."</p><p>"I didn't ask," Agatha fired back, lowering the glass. The woman looked undeterred by her hostility, focusing on wiping the sticky counter with a dirty-looking rag.</p><p>"Not verbally," Rio mused. "And you are?"</p><p>"Still not interested in this conversation," she glanced around the bar, hoping to find another customer impatiently waiting for Rio to take care of their order, but the place was dead. The only people in it were the two bartenders, Agatha, and a group of men playing pool.</p><p>"Bartenders make great therapists, you know?"</p><p>"That's because the customers are wasted and ready to spill their secrets," Agatha scoffed. "Besides, you can't convince me you like it when people bombard you with their problems when you're trying to get through your shift."</p><p>"Depends on the people," Rio looked up from the counter, which did not seem any cleaner, and focused her inquisitive eyes on Agatha again. "So, what's on your mind?"</p><p>"You think I'll become an open book because you called me special?"</p><p>"I don't remember saying that," Rio grinned, and Agatha’s gaze rested on the small gap between her central incisors for a second too long, a traitorous part of her mind wondering what it would feel like to run her tongue over it. "Come on, you're alone at a bar on a Friday. There has to be a story there."</p><p>"And now you're calling me pathetic," Agatha took another swing from her glass, scolding her body for finding the annoying woman attractive. "What an amazing therapist you are."</p><p>"Stop putting words in my mouth," despite the commanding words, Rio's voice remained light as she pushed the rag into her back pocket. "You're not a regular here, and I doubt you'll ever step foot in this place again. You have a chance to say whatever is on your mind to a complete stranger who is used to hearing the weirdest stories and won't judge you. Why not take it?"</p><p>"What makes you think I won't come here again?" Agatha deflected, tilting her head to the side.</p><p>"You're not our usual crowd," the bartender said, pointing to Agatha's crisp button-up and the blazer hanging over the back of her chair. "Corporate, I assume?"</p><p>"You said you don't make assumptions."</p><p>"So, I'm right," Rio smirked again, and something hot coiled low in Agatha's belly. Her eyes uselessly followed the woman's movement as she tapped her index finger against her lips, examining her. "You're too uptight for marketing and not friendly enough for sales, so... finance?"</p><p>"Excuse me?" Agatha bristled, offended by the rude observations based on a scarce conversation, but the bartender ignored her.</p><p>"Ah, so not finance. You're right, it doesn't suit you," Rio pushed her tongue into her cheek, and suddenly, the bar became stuffy. Agatha fought off the wave of heat climbing up her spine as the woman snapped her fingers victoriously, nodding. "Law. You're in law."</p><p>"Well, aren't you little Miss Sherlock Holmes," she grumbled, taking another sip from her glass to wash away the unwelcome sensations swirling in her body. Rio's eyes seemed to shine in the dim light of the bar, making the fire burning low in Agatha’s belly worse.</p><p>"So, is it work? A rough client that thinks they know better than you?" Agatha's face remained passive, but Rio still must have seen the answer in her smooth features because she shook her head. "Nope, not work. Personal life? Your partner giving you a hard time?"</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. A partner would actually solve the problem she was facing.</p><p>"Don't you have inventory to do or something?" Rio smirked again, and Agatha pushed down the urge to climb over the bar and wipe it off her face.</p><p>"Hit the nail right on the head with this one, I see," she gloated. "What could the partner do to make you sit alone in a dingy bar on a Friday night?" her playful expression faltered as she looked at Agatha worriedly. "Did they cheat on you?"</p><p>"If I say yes, will you leave me alone?" Rio visibly relaxed at the rebuttal, the worry disappearing from her face as fast as it had appeared. "It's not about a partner. Not directly, at least."</p><p>Agatha realized her mistake a second too late when Rio's eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. She looked like a dog with a bone, and something told Agatha she would not let it go.</p><p>"Not directly, huh? That's interesting."</p><p>"Very, and also none of your business."</p><p>"It's indirectly about a partner," Rio muttered, ignoring the scalding glare Agatha was sending her as she mulled over the words. "Is it your friends, then? They don't like the person you're seeing?"</p><p>"You realize that each question makes your tip smaller, right?" Agatha leaned back in her chair, the sudden movement making the world swim unsteadily. She glanced at the almost empty glass in front of her, making it the culprit of her state, and rubbed the space between her eyebrows where she could already feel the headache form. "Why are you so invested in this?"</p><p>"I don't know if you've noticed, but the place is dead," Rio nodded toward the men focused on the pool table, their half-drunk beers balancing precariously on its edges. "And you're fascinating."</p><p>"Fascinating?" Agatha echoed, drumming her fingers against the bar. Nobody had ever called her that. Uptight, rude, obnoxious, yes, but never <em>fascinating.</em> "You don't know me."</p><p>"Not for a lack of trying," the bartender shrugged. "You seem put-together. A great lawyer at what I assume is a big corporation, confident and good-looking. And yet, you're here."</p><p>"You have no idea if I'm good at my job," Agatha decided to not focus on the <em>good-looking</em> part. She had been called <em>hot</em> numerous times by numerous people. <em>Good-looking</em> should not have any effect on her.</p><p>And yet, the flames spread from her belly to the rest of her body, undoubtedly making her cheeks pink at the blasé complement.</p><p>"With the way you're deflecting all my questions? I <em>know</em> you are," Rio braced her hands on the bar, leaning to look into Agatha's eyes, and the lawyer’s breath hitched in her throat. The warm pools of brown drew her in, offering comfort and understanding, and her body moved forward, ready to let them swallow her whole. "So, what sorrows are you trying to drown?"</p><p>"My mother," the words tumbled out of her mouth even though Agatha did not remember giving them permission to do so. Rio's irises seemed warmer the longer she looked into them, and Agatha felt almost hypnotized by their pull, feeling her resolve falter.</p><p>"Ah," the bartender nodded sympathetically. "She doesn't approve of the person you're dating?"</p><p>"What gave you the idea that I'm dating someone?" the air around them shifted, the playful banter melting into something heavier, and the longer Agatha looked into Rio’s eyes, the easier the words formed on her tongue. Something about Rio pulled her in, and the alcohol clouding her judgment made resisting it almost impossible.</p><p>"You said it had something to do with a partner."</p><p><em>"Lack</em> of a partner is more accurate," Agatha bit the inside of her cheek. Rio had been right - the chance of Agatha returning to the bar was nonexistent, which meant she would likely never see the woman again. She doubted the bartender would offer a magical solution to her problem, but the opportunity to talk about it to someone other than Wanda, who was full of unhelpful advice and worried looks, was tempting. "I have to get married in a month."</p><p>Rio's reaction was almost cartoonish. Her jaw fell to the ground, her eyes bulging out as she stared at Agatha in shock, breaking her out of the spell cast by the woman’s aura. "What?"</p><p>"I have to get married in a month," Agatha repeated, blinking to rid her mind of the sudden fog enveloping it.</p><p>"Yeah, no, I heard that," Rio leaned back again, not letting her gaze drop from Agatha's face, and the lawyer saw the last sparks of amusement die in her eyes, replaced by worry. "But I think I'll need more context than that. Are you being forced into an arranged marriage? Should I call the police?"</p><p>"No, and even if I was, I don't think the police would do much about it," Agatha swirled the rest of her drink in the glass before downing it, the concern in Rio's voice making her lowered walls shoot back up. She did not want anyone's pity. "Well, this was lovely. Close my tab," she said, reaching for her wallet.</p><p>"What? Wait," a warm hand wrapped around her wrist, sending a jolt of electricity up her arm, and Agatha froze, staring at the long fingers holding her in place. "Sorry," Rio said hurriedly, jumping back before the warmth could spread across Agatha's body, but the touch already left an invisible, scorching mark imprinted in Agatha’s skin. A fleeting thought about feeling those hands all over her body invaded the lawyer’s mind, making her muscles tense. "What do you mean by 'I have to get married in a month'?"</p><p>"That I have to get married in a month."</p><p>"Is it like... a bet or something?" the confused scrunch of Rio's eyebrows made Agatha's hand hover uncertainly over her purse. She could easily refuse to answer any more questions, pay her bill, and walk out of the bar. Leave Rio and her insufferable curiosity behind, and lessen the chances of adding a moral hangover on top of the regular one that would haunt her in the morning. Still, her muscles did not move to get up.</p><p>Agatha glanced at the empty glass. She already had more than she should have. The best course of action would be to get the hell out of the dingy bar before she could embarrass herself . Just as she was about to shake her head and tell the bartender to mind her own business, Rio snatched the glass, the leftover ice clinking with the sudden movement. "Next one is on the house."</p><p>"You're that desperate to hear my story?" Agatha mocked but moved her hand back to the bar, cringing at the stickiness and abandoning her purse for the moment. Something about Rio mesmerized her, and she had about two drinks too many to fight it. Besides, Wanda was already tired of her complains, and Agatha was not done moping. If Rio volunteered to listen, who was Agatha to deny her?</p><p>Rio plucked the bottle of whiskey out of the scarce row of liquor, emptying the glass before refilling the ice and pouring in a healthy amount of liquid. Agatha was sure it was more than the standard drink.</p><p>"It's not often that I hear a unique problem here."</p><p>"You're hoping more alcohol will make me more open?" she asked, eyeing the glass when Rio placed it in front of her with a teasing smile.</p><p>"Not really. It looks like the story calls for booze, though," Agatha could not disagree. She wet her lips with the drink, aware of the buzz clouding her judgment. Rio's prodding made her almost chug the last one. If she wanted to leave the bar sober enough to get an Uber, she had to pace herself.</p><p>"I'm turning forty next month," she said slowly, her eyes on the ice gradually cracking from the whiskey's temperature. The words felt heavy as she said them, uncomfortably sticking to her throat before escaping through her teeth in a hiss.</p><p>"And you have a goal to get married before that?" Rio prodded carefully, making Agatha chuckle humorlessly.</p><p>"If only it were that easy," her fingers started drawing patterns in the water gathering on the glass. "No, <em>my mother</em> has a goal to get me married before that."</p><p>"You said it wasn't an arranged marriage," Agatha pursed her lips, looking at the woman with a frown.</p><p>"Do you want the story or not?"</p><p>"Right, sorry. Staying quiet from now on," Rio made a gesture of zipping her mouth shut, and Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>"I'm not going into details, but my mother is a perfectionist. She believes everyone has a path they should follow - a line of checkpoints you have to go through - and she personally designed mine," Agatha's grip on the glass tightened as the words poured out of her mouth in an unstoppable waterfall. "I resisted it on every turn. She pictured me as a politician, so I became a lawyer. She tried to get me to work for her, so I chose corporate law. She pressed me to find a husband and have a family, so I-" she pressed her lips together, not drunk enough to divulge that part of her life. "The point is, I took everything she wanted to force upon me and twisted it into something else just to watch her seethe."</p><p>Agatha's shoulders slumped, the gratification of annoying her mother dimming in the shadow of what Evanora had chosen to punish her with. She raised the glass to her lips, flinching when the ice cubes hit her teeth, making goose bumps form across her arms. The silence stretched between them, interrupted only by the TV's soft noises and the rowdy chatter of the men at the pool table. Agatha's eyes slowly moved from her glass to land on Rio's face, almost smirking at the impatient press of her lips - like she was fighting to stay quiet.</p><p>"I thought I won, you know? Made my life what I wanted it to be despite her picture-perfect and freed myself of her expectations," she paused again, drumming her fingers against the counter and chuckling dryly. "But, of course, she had to have the last word. One last way of saying: 'I control you no matter how hard you try to fight it', and I feel stupid for not predicting it. For letting myself believe I could beat her."</p><p>Rio's mouth opened slightly before she promptly shut it, her teeth sinking into her lower lip as she nodded for Agatha to continue.</p><p>"A month ago, she had me look over her will. It was weird; she had never come for legal advice to me before, opting for literally any other lawyer. I assumed she wanted me to know the contents. I'm an only child, you see, and we don't have any other family, so logically, I should be one of the beneficiaries," Agatha took another sip to make the next words more manageable. "Imagine my surprise when I noticed a clause that unless I am legally married by forty, all her assets will go to several different organizations."</p><p>"Oh shit," Rio muttered, her eyebrows almost disappearing into her hairline. "That's cold."</p><p>"The punchline is she added it a few days before she had me look at the will," Agatha added grimly, leaning back in her chair with a shrug. "So, that's why I'm drinking alone at a bar on a Friday night."</p><p>"That's a reason if I've ever heard one," Rio paused, her eyes jumping between Agatha, her drink, and the bar. "Do you... need the money?"</p><p>Agatha laughed hollowly at the question, noticing the uncertainty in Rio's body language. She was aware of how stuck up she must seem to the bartender, complaining about giving money to charities while dressed like a Wall Street mogul. "I think anyone would feel bad about losing a few million dollars."</p><p><em>"A few million dollars?!"</em> the volume of Rio's surprise made Agatha jump back in her chair, promptly losing her balance. She shrieked as gravity's unforgiving force pulled her toward the ground, but a steady hand on the collar of her shirt stopped her from toppling over. Rio yanked her forward almost effortlessly, saving her from the undignified fall and gaping at her in shock. "A few million dollars?" she repeated more quietly, her fingers straightening Agatha's mangled shirt before disappearing.</p><p>"Yeah, I don't want to get into it," Agatha said over the deafening thundering of her heart as adrenaline rushed through her veins. She took another sip from the glass, the ice rattling because of the shakiness in her hands, before continuing. "But - to answer your question - I don't <em>need</em> the money. I'm well off without it."</p><p>"Why not let it go to the organizations then?" Rio asked with a frown. "I mean, I understand feeling bitter over losing <em>a few million dollars,</em> but something tells me it's not just the money you're upset about."</p><p>"Are you a psychic or something?" the bartender laughed, wiggling her eyebrows playfully.</p><p>"I was a witch in my previous life."</p><p>"Fitting," Agatha grumbled, running her hand through her hair. "I don't have a problem with the money going to charity. I have a problem with the charities my mother chose."</p><p>"That bad?"</p><p>"The worst," the anger she had felt upon noticing the list of organizations eligible for the money burned in her stomach like molten lava. "Anti-LGBTQ+, anti-abortion," Agatha shook her head. "She specifically chose organizations that stand against everything I believe in just to make me regret everything I did with my life."</p><p>"I know you said your mother is a perfectionist, but I think a bitch would be more fitting," an inelegant snort slipped past Agatha's lips at the comment.</p><p>"That's one way to put it," she laughed before noticing Rio's strange expression. "What?"</p><p>"Well, do you have a plan to stop it?" the question made the amusement evaporate from her face.</p><p>"There's only one way to stop it, and it's not like I have suitors lining at my door," Agatha pointed out. She had read through the will a dozen times, hoping her mother's lawyers had left a loophole she could exploit, if not to get the money, then to transfer it to other charities. The document was ironclad, without a single word she could twist to her benefit.</p><p>"Can't you like, marry a friend or something?"</p><p>"Sadly, my mother knows all my friends," Evanora's web of informants was impressive, always keeping her updated on the people in her daughter's life even though she never cared to ask Agatha about them personally. "The will states that either she or her representative has the right to deny my claim on the grounds of implausibility of the marriage."</p><p>"I'm sure you could hire someone to marry and divorce you," Agatha rolled her eyes at the idea, having heard it numerous times from Wanda.</p><p>"I'm not comfortable marrying someone found on Craigslist. I have a son and a career. I cannot jeopardize my life by possibly bringing a psychopath into it," she noticed Rio open her mouth. "And before you say something about an escort, my mother would sniff them out from a mile away. She would probably see through the Craigslist ploy too."</p><p>"Damn, you really thought this through," Rio pursed her lips, leaning back against the sink parallel to the bar.</p><p>"I had a month to think about it," Agatha said grimly. "All that's left is to drown my sorrows alone in a dingy bar."</p><p>"So, you're giving up?" the question felt like a challenge, making Agatha sit straighter in her chair, her eyes narrowed at the bartender. Rio seemed unbothered by her reaction, calmly standing with her arms crossed over her chest and her head tilted to the side. "You're gonna let organizations that stand against everything you believe in get millions of dollars just like that?"</p><p>"My hands are bound, Rio," Agatha growled, staring daggers at the woman. "I may have a month until my birthday, but it might as well be a day. I won't find anyone I could trust enough to marry, even with the prospect of divorcing them as soon as possible. I cannot legally fight the will because it's airtight, and the marriage is only the beginning. There are other terms I have to uphold to be eligible for the money, and nobody in their right mind would agree to them."</p><p>"What terms?" Rio asked curiously, making Agatha scoff as she angrily swirled the last sip of her drink in the glass. The ice cubes had almost melted.</p><p>"The marriage would have to last for a full year, for one. The person would have to meet my mother, which is never a pleasant experience, and live with me after the marriage," Agatha rattled off the clauses, having learned them by heart after studying the will. "They would have to become a part of my life, in a way, so you can imagine why I don't want to do it with a random person from Craigslist."</p><p>Rio stared at her quietly, slowly tapping her foot against the tiled floor. A wrinkle formed between her eyebrows from thinking about Agatha's predicament, and the lawyer sighed, waving her hand dismissively.</p><p>"Stop trying to find a solution to this. It will give you a stroke."</p><p>"Marry me," Agatha was glad she had finished her drink because she would spill it all over the bar at the words. She blinked to regain her composure, her mind scrambling for a teasing remark to fire back at Rio, but her tongue could only form one word.</p><p>
<em>"What?"</em>
</p><p>"I'm not a stranger from Craigslist, and I know probably most psychopaths would say that, but I'm not a psychopath. So, marry <em>me."</em></p><p>"Are you insane?" Agatha laughed, shaking her head. She should have known telling the bartender about her predicament would end in a disaster, but she expected Rio to bombard her with unhelpful advice or pity her, eventually making her feel even worse. She did not think the woman would try to jump in as her savior. "You may not be from Craigslist, but you're still a stranger. I don't even know your last name."</p><p>"It's Vidal," Rio moved away from the sink, returning to the bar and leaning her palms against it. Her eyes still twinkled with amusement, but her voice was earnest as if her proposition was not absurd. "I'm twenty-seven, working on getting a PhD in biology. I love plants - half of my apartment is covered in them. I'm half Puerto Rican, afraid of heights, and I played soccer in high school. I-"</p><p>"What are you doing?" Agatha interrupted the onslaught of information thrown her way, hating that her mind seemed to examine each piece Rio offered like a prized possession before tucking it away for later.</p><p>"Making sure I'm not a stranger," Rio shrugged. "Where was I? Ah, I don't snore, although I've been told I talk in my sleep after drinking. My blood type is-"</p><p>"Stop," the bartender quirked an eyebrow at Agatha's clipped voice. "This isn't happening."</p><p>"But it could."</p><p>"But it <em>won't,"</em> Agatha said sternly, pushing away her empty glass and reaching for her purse. "I don't need you to save me."</p><p>"I'm giving you a solution to a problem that will impact others," Rio protested, watching Agatha fiddle with her wallet but not trying to stop her as she had before. The offer ricocheted in Agatha’s mind like a bullet, worsening the headache and fuelling the anger swirling in her chest.</p><p>"How altruistic," the lawyer sneered, fishing out a few bills and slapping them on the counter with more force than necessary. "Close my tab."</p><p>"All I'm saying is... you don't have to let your mother win."</p><p>"She already did," Rio rolled her eyes when Agatha tapped her finger against the cash but dutifully moved to fetch the receipt. To Agatha's dismay, she kept talking while fiddling with the register.</p><p>"Not until you're forty and unmarried, she didn't. You're <em>giving up</em> because the solution doesn't fit into your perfect life."</p><p>"You don't know anything about my life," Agatha growled defensively. The accusation settled deep in her chest, taking a bite out of her pride. Agatha Harkness did not <em>give up,</em> but she was smart enough to recognize the hopelessness of her situation.</p><p>"You're willing to let a few million dollars go to horrible organizations because of your pride. I think I know enough," Rio put the receipt and a pen next to the cash and Agatha hated her for sounding disappointed. They did not know each other. They would never see each other again. The woman had no right to act personally offended by Agatha's choices.</p><p>"You're really hung up on those <em>millions,</em> huh?" Agatha bit back, writing down the rounded-up amount before signing the receipt with a shaky hand. She would definitely feel the alcohol in the morning. "Bartending not as lucrative as you hoped? Looking for easy cash?"</p><p>"I doubt anything about being married to you would be easy," Rio quipped as Agatha slid off her chair. The ground wobbled under her feet, and she had to grab the bar's edge to avoid landing face-first on the sticky floor. "Still, my proposition stands. It would benefit both of us, not to mention the world."</p><p>"You're actually insane," Agatha scoffed, regaining her composure and snatching her blazer off the chair's back. It reeked of beer like the rest of the bar, and she curled her lip in disgust. She would have to have it dry-cleaned to get rid of the stench. "You're offering to marry a stranger. You do realize that, right? You don't even know my name."</p><p>"I do now," the lawyer flipped her hair over her shoulder and readjusted the lapels of her blazer before frowning at the comment. She looked at Rio in confusion, searching her face for an explanation. The woman smirked like a cat that got the canary, wordlessly pointing to the signed receipt. Despite the shakiness of her hand, Agatha managed to make her name legible. <em>"Agatha Harkness."</em></p><p>"You can read. Good for you," Agatha's purse swung when she forcefully pushed it up her shoulder, wincing when the strap caught on her hair. "Take care, Vidal."</p><p>Before she could walk away, Rio grabbed her sleeve, pressing something into her hand. Agatha bristled, feeling her warmth seep through the thin material and burn her skin again, spreading up her arm even after Rio withdrew her hand. Agatha’s fingers wrapped involuntarily around the item, feeling its scratchy surface.</p><p>"In case you change your mind," the bartender winked, flashing the gap between her teeth in a grin, and the lawyer tightened her grip on the item, crushing it in her palm.</p><p>"I won't," Agatha growled, turning on her heel and promptly exiting the bar, feeling victorious for having the last word. She could feel Rio’s eyes drill holes into the back of her neck as she slammed the door behind her.</p><p>Her Uber arrived in two minutes, and she slid into the back seat silently, not entertaining the chatty driver's need for conversation. The foreign object in her hand burned against her skin, and before Agatha could stifle her curiosity, her fingers were already opening. She glared at the crumpled napkin resting on her palm, suspecting what she would find on it, but unfurled it shakily, seething at the words haphazardly scrawled in a black pen.</p><p>
<em>Give me a call if you wanna get married. Or talk about another unique problem. Te veo.</em>
</p><p>Followed by a heart and a phone number.</p><p>Agatha crushed the napkin in her fist before shoving it into her purse.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha's rigidly trained internal clock did not offer her the mercy of sleeping through the hangover, waking her just after eight to a bright room and a pounding headache. She groaned into her pillow, immediately flinching at the piercing pain rattling in her skull from the offensive sound. Her throat was dry, her tongue stiff and resting uncomfortably against her teeth, and she focused all her energy on rolling onto her back. Despite keeping her eyelids squeezed shut, she could feel the world tilt around her, causing a wave of nausea to climb up her throat.</p><p>"Fuck," she whined quietly, not wanting to provoke another burst of pain, and slowly opened her eyes. Relief washed over her at the sight of a glass displayed in the middle of her nightstand, along with aspirin and her purse. At least drunk Agatha had enough courtesy to care for hungover Agatha.</p><p>Bracing herself to sit up took another five minutes, but the compelling promise of lessening the pain thrumming steadily in her temples urged her to rest her back against the headboard. With a shaky hand, she grabbed the glass and the aspirin, popping two pills into her mouth before washing them down with the water and sighing contently. She always believed that age was just a number, but she remembered times when the few drinks she had the night before would have evaporated from her system before she got out of the Uber, and it brought a sour taste to her mouth, worse than the traces of whiskey still sticking to her teeth.</p><p>She was almost forty, and even though the number itself did not scare her, the weight her mother had put on it certainly did. Her proud, <em>vindictive</em> mother who would move heaven and earth to prove Agatha wrong and show her disappointment in every way she could. The clause was the cherry on top of the cake baked from snide remarks, degrading comments, and criticism that Agatha had grown used to over the years, but the callousness still blindsided her.</p><p>Evanora's pleased smirk flashed in Agatha's memory, making her blood boil with the rage from when she had studied the carefully constructed will for the first time. Sitting in her mother's office after months of scarce phone calls and obligatory outings had put Agatha's senses on high alert, preparing her for the ball to drop. And when it had, it created a hole in the polished floor under Agatha's feet.</p><p>She clenched her jaw, putting the empty glass back on the nightstand with a loud thud. The problem had been gnawing at her for over a month now, and she was nowhere near accepting the only possible outcome. She doubted she ever would. Not with her mother's victorious smile branded into her eyelids. Years of painstakingly making her life her own washed down the drain by a single clause in a legal document that, despite her occupation, she could not fight. The universe had a wicked sense of humor.</p><p>When the piercing headache diminished to an unpleasant throb, Agatha reached for her purse to get her phone. Wanda insisted on stepping by, using dropping off Nicky as an excuse, and Agatha had to make herself presentable before that, or she would face an onslaught of unnecessarily annoying questions. As much as she loved her friend, Wanda's unyielding concern regarding everything revolving around Evanora could be overwhelming, and opening the door while looking like a mess would be like waving a red cape at a bull. The last thing Agatha needed was interrogation over coffee.</p><p>She fiddled with the zipper, cursing under her breath when it got stuck, and finally opened the handbag. As she plucked her phone from the purse, a crumpled napkin fell into her lap, making her frown. Her eyes zeroed in on the black heart looking up at her from between the creases, and the headache reappeared ten times stronger than before.</p><p>"Fucking hell," she grumbled, feeling a wave of shame wash over her as her cheeks reddened. Rio's relentlessness and effortless confidence lured Agatha into a false sense of security, and now she was paying the price in the form of a moral hangover. She had not told anyone other than Wanda about her predicament, knowing everyone would shower her with unhelpful advice and admonish her for not trying to fight the outcome. Yet Rio managed to pry the truth out of her with the ease of somebody taking candy from a baby.</p><p>Against her best judgment, Agatha unfolded the napkin, rereading the message she had stumbled through in the dimly lit Uber.</p><p>
<em>Give me a call if you wanna get married.</em>
</p><p>The <em>nerve</em> of that woman.</p><p>The bartender had to be clinically insane to be serious about the offer. Nobody in their right mind would consider marrying a random person at a bar after an hour-long conversation, especially sober, and nothing about Rio's behavior told Agatha she could be under the influence. No, the woman had been stone-cold sober, her eyes clear and her face confident when she proposed to get married, which made the situation even more ridiculous - and ensured Agatha that despite Rio's assurances, she <em>had to</em> be a psychopath. Or at least have something wrong with her.</p><p>Because why else would a woman over a decade younger than her propose to spend a year of her life entertaining Evanora's cruel games?</p><p>Nobody was that altruistic. Even in light of where the inheritance would go, Agatha doubted anyone other than a saint would make the decision Rio had made on the spot. Proposing to a woman she had known for an hour in a way one would offer to buy a stranger a drink. Even less so since Rio had not even bothered to <em>ask.</em> There had been no upward lilt at the end of her sentence. It sounded almost like an order.</p><p>
<em>Marry me.</em>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed, remembering the serious tone of Rio's voice. The woman had spent almost an hour meticulously breaking through Agatha's walls with brazen questions and teasing quips, but the end of their conversation lacked the amused attitude. Agatha did not know the woman - hence the ridiculousness of the idea - but Rio did not strike her as the kind of person who took <em>anything</em> seriously.</p><p>What was so different about Agatha's, as Rio kindly put it, <em>unique</em> problem that made the bartender seriously consider an offer Agatha did not make?</p><p><em>Money</em> whispered a helpful voice at the back of Agatha's mind, making her flinch. Rio had said she was still at school, getting a PhD in biology - of course, despite Agatha's protests, her brain tucked every piece of information Rio had given her into a special drawer labeled <em>possibly insane bartender </em>- and Agatha knew college could rob anyone blind. Working at the bar was definitely not enough to cover the fees. Agatha doubted it was enough to <em>stay alive</em> in this economy.</p><p>Rio probably decided that writing off a year of her life in exchange for enough money to pay her loans was a great opportunity and jumped at the chance. Agatha could respect that - a person knowing what they wanted and going after it. Still, it did not make the situation any less absurd in her eyes.</p><p>The phone clenched tightly in her hand buzzed furiously, the shrill ringtone snapping her out of her thoughts. She glanced at the caller ID and groaned when Wanda's name stared back at her almost mockingly as if the woman knew she had spent the past thirty minutes spiraling.</p><p>"Hello," she grunted, pressing the phone to her ear and glancing at the digital clock on her nightstand. The bold, red letters announced it was barely nine.</p><p>"Good morning to you too," Wanda's cheerful tone felt offensive in light of Agatha's miserable life situation. "Late night? Did you have fun with your friend?"</p><p>"I'm not one of your students. Stop asking your questions like I'm seven," her friend laughed, the sound jumping out of the phone and digging straight into Agatha's ear, sending another wave of pain through her skull. "And no. Jen abandoned me after one drink. Some shitty excuse about work."</p><p>It was not necessarily an <em>excuse</em>. Agatha knew the call Jen had gotten concerned a case the woman had been working on for weeks, and from the way Jen’s eyes had lit up, she suspected it could mean a possible lead. Still, it did not change the fact that it led to Agatha being abandoned at a terrible bar.</p><p>"You're a master at using work as an excuse. Not that fun when you're on the receiving end, huh?" Agatha rolled her eyes, choosing not to react to the taunt. "Well, since you had an earlier night, we can move our coffee from after to before lunch. I'll come by with the boys in, let's say, an hour?"</p><p>The offer made Agatha frown, and as she sat straighter, her mind ran with worse-case scenarios. "Is Nicky alright?"</p><p>"He wants to show the twins some new game he got," Agatha relaxed back into her bed, the anxiety evaporating from her aching muscles. "See you in an hour!"</p><p>"Wait-" Wanda hung up before she could negotiate more time, and Agatha groaned, chucking her phone aside and reluctantly slipping out from under the covers. Her hair reeked of beer, as did her skin, and even without a mirror, she knew she looked terrible with last night's makeup still sticking to her skin.</p><p>An hour to whip herself into a human shape was not enough, but she decided to start with making her bed and showering.</p><p>Begrudgingly, she set the unfolded napkin on her bedside table before adjusting the covers, forcing her mind to focus on anything other than the annoying bartender.</p><hr/><p>"Hi, Mama!" Agatha laughed when Nicky crashed into her the second she opened the door, wrapping his hands around her waist. She ruffled his hair, bending in half to press a kiss to his head.</p><p>"Hi, baby. Did you have fun at Aunt Wanda's?" her son detached himself from her far too quickly for her liking, nodding enthusiastically.</p><p>"We watched a game with Uncle Vis! And then he let us play his game where you create your own team! And I crushed Tommy!"</p><p>"Did not!" the mentioned twin stepped around Wanda to let her close the door and frowned at Nicky.</p><p>"Did too!"</p><p>"Yeah, well, Billy <em>crushed</em> you!" Tommy looked at his brother expectantly, but before the boy could say anything, their mother stepped in.</p><p>"Boys, don't start again," Wanda sighed tiredly. "Nicky, didn't you want to show the boys something?"</p><p>"Oh, yeah!" Nicky's brown eyes turned toward Agatha pleadingly. "Mama, can I show Billy and Tommy my new game? Please."</p><p>"Sure, but if I hear more arguing, I'm confiscating it," Agatha warned, something in Wanda's expression telling her that the boys were in a bickering mood. Nicky nodded eagerly before bolting toward his room, the twins following him wordlessly.</p><p>"Tommy, Billy, you could at least say 'hello' to Aunt Aga- yeah, they can't hear me," Wanda sighed again, making Agatha smile.</p><p>"Rough sleepover?" she teased, knowing that despite Wanda's occupation as a preschool teacher, the boys could run down anyone's patience if they were in the mood.</p><p>"I'm blaming Vis and his stupid game," Wanda grumbled, running her hand through her hair before focusing on her friend. "I thought you said you only had one drink."</p><p>Agatha frowned, offended. "And what makes you think I had more?"</p><p>"Your hair is still wet, which means you've showered recently, and it's after ten. You're usually up and functioning after eight like a psychopath," the redhead shot her a proud smirk, making her roll her eyes.</p><p>"Suddenly, I'm surrounded by detectives," she snarled before she could think the comment through, and Wanda's eyebrows shot up. "Coffee?"</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, Agatha moved toward the kitchen, hoping the subject change would make Wanda forget her slip-up. Of course, it did not.</p><p>"What other detectives are you surrounded by?" her friend asked almost innocently, taking her usual seat at the kitchen island as Agatha busied herself with making the coffee. "Did you meet someone at the bar? Is that why you look like you haven't slept?"</p><p>"I slept plenty, thank you very much," Wanda's eyes gleamed, and she groaned at the innuendo on the woman's face. <em>"Alone."</em></p><p>"But you <em>did </em>meet someone."</p><p>"And what makes you say that?"</p><p>"Intuition," Agatha scoffed at the lousy explanation. "Come on, Jen left you alone at the bar after one drink, and you look hungover. I know you're older than me-"</p><p>"By only four years," the redhead dismissively waved her comment off.</p><p>"But you wouldn't be in this state after one drink, and you're not the kind of person who drinks half a bar alone."</p><p>"Maybe I came home and treated myself to a few glasses of wine?" Agatha argued, putting the steaming mug in front of her friend before grabbing her own and leaning her hip against the counter. Wanda nodded in thanks, wrapping her hands around the mug and tapping her fingernails against the porcelain with a knowing smirk.</p><p>"You were still at the bar at one," Agatha almost spit out the coffee, staring at the redhead in shock.</p><p>"Seriously? You were checking my location?" the woman shrugged.</p><p>"The world is dangerous, and you gave it to me for that precise reason."</p><p>"No, I gave it to you because you wouldn't stop hounding me about it," Agatha said through gritted teeth. "If I knew you'd use it to gather evidence for interrogations, I wouldn't let you talk me into it."</p><p>"You know your stalling won't work, right?" Wanda laughed, ignoring her dramatics. "We've known each other for over fifteen years. Your tactics don't work on me anymore."</p><p>"I don't remember a time when they <em>did</em> work," the redhead grinned at her, lifting the cup to her lips and taking a long sip before quirking her eyebrow. "Fine. I wanted to leave the bar after three drinks because <em>I was</em> drinking alone - maybe you don't know me that well - but then an annoying bartender started grilling me about my life, so I stayed for two more."</p><p>The last of which was undoubtedly the reason behind her miserable state. Rio had put at least twice as much alcohol in it than she should.</p><p>"Wait, she started grilling you, and you <em>stayed?"</em> if Agatha did not know better, she would be worried her friend's eyes would fall out of the sockets.</p><p>"I was having a day. You know, with what will happen in a month," Agatha said, hoping that mentioning her birthday would deter Wanda from pushing the subject. The redhead pursed her lips at the mention but quickly shook the contempt off.</p><p>"Well, if you were having a day, I think I'll have to find that bartender to congratulate her on getting you to talk to her."</p><p>"Please don't," Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>"What did you talk about?" the brunette thought about the neatly folded napkin on her bedside table.</p><p>
<em>Give me a call if you wanna get married.</em>
</p><p>She scowled into her mug.</p><p>"Work."</p><p>"For a lawyer, you can be a really shitty liar sometimes," Wanda leaned forward in her chair, bracing her forearms on the island as if getting a closer look at Agatha would give her all the answers she needed.</p><p>"Being a lawyer is not about lying."</p><p>"Explains why you still have your job," Agatha rolled her eyes. She knew Wanda would not let the subject go without a fight, and she was too hungover for her friend's bullshit. "If the conversation were about work, you would not act like a teenager accused of smoking by their parents."</p><p>"That's your go-to comparison? It doesn't even make any sense," Wanda did not answer, only raised her eyebrow. "Jesus, Wanda, you're interrogating me over getting ditched at a bar and making small talk with a bartender. How dull is your life?"</p><p>"Small talk wouldn't make you so defensive," the redhead noticed. "And I know you're not doing it to play with me. You're too hungover and tired for that."</p><p>"You're as insufferable as Rio," Agatha groaned, ignoring the curious spark in her friend's eyes. The name rolled off her tongue effortlessly, bringing her the image of the bartender's coy smile, and the corner of her mouth twitched to suppress a frown. She needed to cut the interrogation short before her mind decided to bring forth more memories of Rio or - heaven forbid - reignite the sensations Agatha had felt throughout their conversation. "Besides, it doesn't matter what we talked about. It's not like I'll see her again."</p><p>"Why not? You didn't ask for her number?" Agatha flinched at her mistake, her thoughts wandering off to that godforsaken napkin. She had to throw it out after Wanda left.</p><p>"No, I didn't," it was not a lie, considering Agatha did not have to ask for anything. Rio had chosen to give her the number, and the lawyer briefly wondered if burning it would be too dramatic. "And I'll never step foot in that bar again. I'll have to get my clothes dry-cleaned to rid them of the stench. I shampooed my hair <em>twice,</em> and it still smells like beer," she caught a loose strand between her fingers and waved it toward Wanda as if to prove her point. The redhead laughed at the disgust on her face, shaking her head.</p><p>"Rio must have been excellent company if you decided to stay in a place like that for her," Agatha thought back to the lectures on criminal law from her times in university, trying to remember what the punishment for strangling somebody with her bare hands would be. "You do realize I won't let this go, right? Your attempts at changing the topic are only making me more curious."</p><p>"Wasn't there a saying about this? Curiosity killed the cat?" Wanda shrugged, leisurely sipping on her coffee.</p><p>"At least the cat died doing what it loved."</p><p>"Poking its nose into other cats' business?"</p><p>"Caring for its cat friends," Agatha snorted at the words. "Do you want me to start guessing what you talked about? Because I can. Let's see... was it the sudden draught you're going through with your sex life?"</p><p>The mug almost slipped out of Agatha's grasp, her fingers barely grasping its edge to stop it from crashing into pieces on the tiled floor. A splash of coffee ended up scalding the skin of her wrist, but she shook it off, her eyes glued to Wanda.</p><p>"Why the fuck would I tell a hot bartender about that?!" she hissed through her teeth, thankful the boys were in Nicky's room. "And it's not a <em>draught</em>, it's a choice."</p><p>"Right," Wanda shot her an unimpressed look. "I'm just thinking of topics that would give you such an impressive moral hangover. I haven't seen you like this since you got drunk, slept with your ex, forgot your phone at her place after sneaking out in the middle of the night, and instead of admitting it, decided to try to convince me it got stolen until I called you and she picked up."</p><p>Agatha flinched at the memory - not her best work.</p><p>"That was years ago."</p><p>"Is that what you talked to Rio about?" Agatha squeezed the bridge of her nose, closing her eyes.</p><p>She wanted to bury the memory of Rio - of that <em>damn</em> smirk, the effortless confidence, and the mesmerizing, warm eyes - deep inside and move on, but a part of her knew it would not be that easy. Wanda could get bored of the conversation after a few more deflective answers and pretend to drop it, only to return to it when Agatha least expected it, catching her off guard. It could result in Agatha admitting things she wished not to think about. The best course of action was to throw Wanda a bone before she could surprise her on a random Thursday.</p><p>"We talked about my mother," she finally broke, her voice strained. To avoid looking at her friend, Agatha busied herself with wiping her hand clean of the coffee and clearing the few droplets off the floor, but Wanda's surprise was audible. The woman inhaled sharply, her mug rattling against the island as she set it down abruptly.</p><p>"You told her about the clause?"</p><p>"Yes," Agatha clenched her teeth. She knew Wanda wanted more - a detailed recollection of the conversation - but she could not find the words to describe it. What about Rio made opening about such a heavy topic easy? Why did she tell her about something she had not even told Jen, one of her closest friends?</p><p>She thought back to the bartender's easy smile and tantalizing warmth. Rio oozed confidence and security that assured the people around her that they could trust her with their deepest secrets. Paired with Agatha's conviction that she would not see the woman again and the alcohol blurring the edges of her thoughts, Rio's personality carefully loosened the death grip Agatha had on herself, meticulously prying off her armor.</p><p>Something about Rio's accurate observations and hesitant worry made Agatha feel seen for the first time in a long time, and the realization made her heart clench uncomfortably.</p><p>"What did she say?" Wanda's question snapped her out of her thoughts, making her blink. Agatha chucked the dirty paper towel into the trash can before turning to look at her friend with a shrug.</p><p>"Asked me if it was an arranged marriage and if she should call the police. Then, when I told her about the specifics, she started rattling off different ideas - no, none of them were good," she said when she noticed Wanda open her mouth again. "And then she threw a fit and accused me of giving up."</p><p>The disappointment in Rio's voice rang in her ears, making her scowl. For what felt like the hundredth time, Agatha reminded herself that she did not <em>care</em> what a stranger from a bar thought about her.</p><p>"But you didn't. Give up, I mean," Wanda said slowly, her face compassionate, and it made Agatha's skin crawl. "You're still trying to find something, right?"</p><p>"Find what, Wanda?" Agatha felt her pride claw its way up her throat, scratching it as the words escaped in an angry growl. They had been over this numerous times, brainstorming possibilities and coming up with useless solutions, and she was sick of scratching the wound left by her mother's traitorous knife open. Of the constant reminders that she <em>lost.</em> "A loophole? I know that part of the document by heart now - I can recite it in my fucking sleep! There's no loophole! If there were, I wouldn't have random bartenders proposing to me in a misguided attempt at saving the world!"</p><p>"She did <em>what</em>?!" Wanda's usually calm voice rang across the house like an alarm, and Agatha's eyes darted toward the staircase, her ears straining to hear the sounds coming from Nicky's room. Thankfully, the boys seemed too occupied by the game to pay attention to their mothers.</p><p>Agatha wet her lips with her tongue, feeling her anger diminish. She had not planned on disclosing that part of her encounter with Rio, and now, there was no way Wanda would let her off the hook.</p><p>"After I shot all her ideas down, she told me to marry her," Wanda gaped at her with her mouth hung open, sputtering to find something to say. "I told her she was insane and left the bar," she added, wanting to keep the retelling as short as possible.</p><p>"I- wow, okay," Agatha leaned back against the counter, watching her friend try to regain her ability to speak. "You've never met her before?"</p><p>"No, Wanda. We talked for an hour, and she proposed," a comment about lesbians moving fast swelled on the tip of her tongue, but she swallowed it. She was not in the mood for a lecture about assuming people's sexuality, and Wanda was a very <em>vocal</em> ally. "And now that I told you, you can stop interrogating me and we can move on from this conversation. Forever."</p><p>"We're not <em>moving on</em> from anything," Wanda said quickly, shaking off the rest of her shock and sitting straighter in her chair, her eyes shining like she had an epiphany. "Was there something wrong with her?"</p><p>Agatha frowned at the question. "I mean... she proposed to a stranger. I'm pretty sure that speaks for itself."</p><p>"In good faith, that's a plus in my book."</p><p>"There's no <em>book</em>. Rio's a PhD student, probably drowning in debt, so she tried to seize the opportunity of having somebody pay off her loans."</p><p>"A PhD student?" Wanda echoed, scratching her chin. "How old is she?"</p><p>"Twenty-seven," she answered without a second thought, regretting the words as soon as they left her mouth. Her friend's lips stretched in a teasing smile.</p><p>"Looks like she's not that much of a stranger," Agatha raised her eyes to the ceiling, praying to a god she did not believe in for the exchange to end. "You know quite a few things about her."</p><p>"Yeah, the kind of things you find out in the first two sentences of a conversation," she noticed, ignoring the voice at the back of her mind reminding her of all the facts Rio had shared. Disclosing them to Wanda would not only prove the point the redhead tried to make but also show how effortlessly Agatha had remembered them.</p><p>And how - despite her best efforts - she could not forget them, which spoke volumes, considering she did not remember most of her coworkers' names after working with them for years.</p><p>"So, she's a PhD student working behind a bar who offered to marry you."</p><p>"Yes, thank you for the recap," Wanda drummed her fingers against her empty mug, deep in thought. Agatha stared at her in disbelief. "Oh, no. I know what you're thinking, and it's a terrible idea."</p><p>"Why not go for it?" the lawyer's jaw dropped. A part of her hoped Wanda would bring a fire extinguisher to the sizzling amber of hope blooming in her heart, but the woman decided to fan the flames, not thinking about the fiery tornado it could create.</p><p>"Why not- are you insane too?" she sputtered. "For one, <em>she's a stranger.</em> Also, she's <em>thirteen </em>years younger than me. You know what the clause calls for - I would have to stay married to her for a year! Live with her!"</p><p>"Then get to know her," Wanda said, crossing her arms over her chest and sending Agatha a pointed look. "I understand not wanting to tie yourself to a stranger for a year, but she doesn't have to be a stranger. If she's willing to do this with you, she-"</p><p>"Must be insane?"</p><p>"Cannot be that bad," the redhead held up her palm when Agatha opened her mouth to say something. "I'm not finished. You refused to hire someone to do it because you were afraid nobody sane would agree to it, which I understood. There was also the argument about your mother finding out about it, which was fair, considering Evanora's pettiness," Wanda scowled like the name burned her tongue. "But this? You didn't have to leave a single digital footprint behind - the opportunity fell into your lap. You have a month to get to know Rio and see if she's a good fit. If it doesn't pan out, shame, but if it does? You can <em>win.</em>"</p><p>"I could have done that with anyone," Agatha noticed.</p><p>"But you didn't because you were hoping to fight the document on legal grounds," the comment made Agatha's jaw jump. "Besides, I doubt you would find someone as fitting on the Internet."</p><p>"You don't know her."</p><p>"I know she managed to get you to open up about an incredibly touchy subject," Wanda retorted without missing a beat, making Agatha pause. Of course, she was right. Something about Rio made opening up to her easy, and a part of her was scared of the vulnerability she allowed herself to show while talking to the woman. "Okay, listen, do you know her last name?"</p><p>"Vidal," she said too quickly, her eyes widening when Wanda reached for her phone. "What are you doing?" she asked, circling the island to peer over her friend's shoulder.</p><p>"Well, getting to know her should start with checking if she didn't lie about her name," Agatha watched Wanda type 'Rio Vidal' into Instagram's search bar, speechless. "Is that her?"</p><p>Despite her mind's protests, Agatha glanced at the profile Wanda had chosen, tapping to show her the first photo. Rio smiled at her from the phone, her right arm wrapped around the other bartender as they posed in front of some building. The amusement sparkling in Rio's eyes tugged at Agatha's heart, and she bit the inside of her cheek not to smile at the photo like an idiot.</p><p>"Okay, so that's a yes," Wanda's tone made her look away from the phone. She glared at the woman, who only smirked before refocusing on the profile. There were not many photos, and most of them did not show Rio, but different landscapes and plants. Eventually, Wanda stopped at a post from what Agatha assumed to be something organized by the university and nodded appreciatively. "You weren't lying. She's hot."</p><p>"I don't remember saying that, and you have a husband," she muttered, her eyes jumping between Rio's confident smile and the fitted suit that hugged her in all the right places. She looked powerful, and Agatha found herself licking her lips, thinking back to the sensation of Rio's hand wrapping around her collar and saving her from the fall. About how strong her fingers felt clasping her wrist and how enticing the warmth felt. Would they be the same on her skin? On her hips? Would Rio-</p><p>"Hello? You still with me?" Agatha jumped when fingers entered her line of sight, snapping twice. She blinked the thoughts away, refocusing on her friend, who smiled knowingly. "I'm not going to tease you about this - for now - but it looks like everything Rio told you is true."</p><p>"Well, thank you, Detective Maximoff," she said sarcastically, turning on her heel to get started on lunch since it looked like Wanda was not planning on leaving soon. "It's still not happening. Case closed."</p><p>"Case reopened," Wanda challenged, something in her voice making Agatha glance at her from behind the fridge door. The woman held up her phone, showing her the opened chat, and Agatha's heart sank into her stomach.</p><p>"You wouldn't-"</p><p>"Oh, I would. Either contact Rio on your own, or I will do it for you. Your choice."</p><p>"Doesn't seem like much of a choice," Agatha hissed, slamming the fridge shut with more force than necessary. She heard something crash inside but decided to worry about it later. Her eyes narrowed as she tried to move the phone away from Wanda using her will. "What kind of a friend are you? Pushing me to marry a stranger? It will bite you in the ass if she murders me."</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. The sound of typing filled the kitchen, and Agatha jumped forward, desperate to rip the phone out of her friend's hands. Predicting her reaction, Wanda slid off her chair and protectively put the device behind her back.</p><p>"Stop acting like a child," she said, dodging Agatha's swipes. "I'm not telling you to marry her, only to meet her for coffee and try to get to know her."</p><p>"And if I don't agree?"</p><p>"I'll message her and tell her how you drooled over the photo of her in a suit," Agatha's eyes widened in horror.</p><p>"And you're saying I'm the one acting like a child?" Wanda shrugged.</p><p>"Take it or leave it, Harkness."</p><p>"Fine!" she threw her hands up in defeat, regretting every choice she had made that led her to this point. "I'll call her later."</p><p>"Excelle- wait, you have her number?"</p><p>"I plead the Fifth," Agatha muttered. "We're done with this conversation."</p><p>Wanda nodded, locking her phone and putting it in her back pocket with a victorious smile. It made Agatha wonder how many people she had killed in her previous life to deserve this.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha did not call Rio. Whether the decision came from her pathological need to disobey any order or the conviction it would not change anything, she did not know. Either way, she blamed Wanda. After knowing her for years, her best friend should have been smart enough to insist on watching her dial the number and listen to the conversation. Leaving it up to Agatha was equal to admitting defeat, and the lawyer decided to use Wanda's guilelessness to her advantage.</p><p>She settled on waiting a few days before telling Wanda that the meeting went terribly, throwing in a credible reason why the marriage would never work out and moving on with her life. As opposed to her friend's comments, Agatha was a <em>terrific</em> liar, and she had prepared a list of excuses, along with backups, in case Wanda asked probing questions. She prepared for the conversation as she would prepare for a case, and there was no room for surprise or stumbling over her words. It would be a precise, clean cut that would rob Wanda of her illusions about using Rio to solve an impossible problem and incite her to leave Agatha alone.</p><p>After the conversation, she would drown her sorrows in alcohol and wait for her fortieth birthday like a person waiting for their execution on death row - accepting her fate like an <em>adult.</em></p><p>
<em>You're giving up.</em>
</p><p>Rio's voice whispered in her ear constantly, a parasite she could not cast out. The whispers grew into deafening roars whenever Agatha looked at the battered napkin she had yet to throw out. The flimsy piece of paper lay on her nightstand, glaring at her disapprovingly whenever she went to bed.</p><p>She had not picked it up since discovering it in her purse, afraid of losing control and dialing the number the second her fingers touched the napkin. The urge overwhelmed her senses whenever she caught a glimpse of the black heart standing out against the white paper, and Agatha knew it was not about asking Rio to go through with her offer. It went deeper - somewhere in the dangerous territory of inviting her to dinner outside of Evanora's madness, maybe seeing her bedroom.</p><p>It made Agatha's skin crawl. Wanda's remark about her <em>draught</em> was untrue. She <em>chose </em>not to go through the motions of getting someone into her bed. Between her job and Nicky, dating was an afterthought - an unattainable idea she entertained whenever she saw a beautiful woman at a bar or a restaurant. Even before giving up on dating, meeting someone never went beyond a first date, which usually satiated her urges and reminded her that putting yourself out there took effort and time, both of which she could not afford to split into even smaller fractions.</p><p>Her conscious decision not to indulge in any trysts in the past months stood behind the unscratchable itch deep in her chest, urging her to call Rio, and Agatha refused to give in.</p><p>Control was vital.</p><p>Agatha had spent her entire life fighting tooth and nail to pry it out of her mother's cold hands. It was a painful process of breaking and healing, and she was proud of coming out on top - of not letting her mother's expectations weigh her down or push her into a life she did not want. Contacting Rio would be like contradicting herself, no matter the reason behind it.</p><p>Calling to discuss the offer would mean admitting Evanora still had control over her decisions. Nobody seemed to understand that her mother would win no matter Agatha's decision. Including that clause in the contract was a calculated move to embarrass her, and it worked perfectly.</p><p>She could marry a stranger or let organizations she despised get the money rightfully hers—that was her choice. Either option meant bending to Evanora's will because her mother had purposefully created a scenario without a possible pleasant outcome to watch her squirm. She could uproot her life to play Evanora's game or accept the defeat and hate herself for it.</p><p>Calling Rio to ask her out without thinking about the offer would not work either. The clause had already wormed its way between them, and Agatha could not look the woman in the eye after the vulnerability of their conversation. She doubted Rio would even <em>want</em> to talk to her without the promise of easy cash, but she did not care. Letting Rio in was a mistake. A mistake she was not planning on repeating.</p><p>Evanora had already won.</p><p>No matter what Wanda, Rio, or that tiny part of Agatha's mind thought.</p><p>There was no winning. The sooner everyone accepted it, the better.</p><hr/><p>The plan of outright lying to Wanda about the bartender was perfect. Agatha had all the details memorized, all the things Rio had supposedly said and done that would make Wanda drop the topic, and she played into her role seamlessly like an Oscar-winning actress.</p><p>The retelling of the imagined date was short but informative, offering enough to paint the picture she wanted Wanda to see, but hesitantly chopped to make it seem real. Agatha paused in all the right places, made appropriate faces, and watched her tone to seem genuinely upset that the plan did not work out. Under Wanda's scrutiny, she delivered the performance of her lifetime, watching her friend for reactions and congratulating herself whenever the redhead frowned or pursed her lips.</p><p>As she got to the punchline - an obnoxious comment about not liking children, which would undoubtedly seal the deal - Agatha could almost taste the victory on her tongue.</p><p>Of course, the universe had other plans.</p><p>"Agatha!" she froze, her mouth hanging open at the familiar voice reaching her ears despite the cacophony of sounds resonating across the park. Before she had the time to think back to that one time she had accidentally broken a mirror - it had to be the reason for her bad luck - Rio jogged up to the bench, her silhouette casting a shadow over her and Wanda's sitting forms. Agatha's eyes darted to the woman, taking in the sweat clinging to her skin and the tight shirt hugging her chest, and she gritted her teeth. "Fancy seeing you here."</p><p>"It's a public park," Rio laughed at her grumpiness, turning her attention to Wanda, who examined her silently with an unreadable expression. With a start, Agatha realized she had spent the past fifteen minutes making Rio seem like the worst human being on earth in a retelling of an imagined date. She had to cut the interaction short before the women started comparing notes. "Well-"</p><p>"Hi, I'm Rio," the bartender said, extending her hand toward Wanda with a friendly smile. Dread spread evenly across Agatha's body.</p><p>"Wanda," despite the frown tugging at her lips, Wanda shook the offered palm, and Rio tilted her head.</p><p>"Are you a friend of Agatha's?" she asked politely, making Agatha's heart sink. One of the focal points of her performance was convincing Wanda that Rio had a problem with how close they were, shamelessly playing into her friend's protectiveness. The name should at least ring a bell, considering how opposed Rio had reportedly been to their friendship.</p><p>The redhead must have realized it, too, because she stopped trying to fight her frown, letting it crease her features. "Yeah, I'm her best friend. We've known each other since college."</p><p>"That's amazing. You know, I think some of the strongest friendships are made in classes. Shared burdens and such," Rio laughed. "Are you a lawyer too?"</p><p>"Preschool teacher," Wanda answered, glancing at Agatha, who shrugged indifferently despite her thundering heart. Her only hope was that Wanda would decide Rio had not even bothered to remember anything about her, making her seem even worse. Maybe the situation could play to her advantage if she cut the conversation short. "We met through my husband. He was in the same class as Agatha when we started dating, and they had to work on a project together."</p><p>"And-"</p><p>"Are you writing a book or something? Skip this chapter," Agatha growled, rudely interrupting Rio's next question. The bartender laughed, undeterred by the warning in her voice.</p><p>"Yeah, I am. The title is 'How to make a polite conversation?'" Rio wiggled her eyebrows playfully, her eyes sparkling with familiar amusement. They seemed warmer without the dim light of the bar stifling their colors, and Agatha found herself involuntarily trying to map out all the shades of brown swimming in the irises. "I know you're not too familiar with the term, but come on, you can at least try after leaving me hanging."</p><p>Agatha's mind screeched at the innocent comment, already suspecting what it would cause.</p><p>"I don't think you can give someone lessons on being polite after how you behaved on your date," Wanda jumped in, leveling the bartender with a glare, and Agatha wondered how hard she would have to pray for the ground to open and swallow her.</p><p>"Our date?" Rio repeated, her confused eyes jumping between the two women. She shifted her weight from one foot to another, pushing back a loose strand of hair that escaped her high ponytail. "I didn't know our encounter at the bar counted as a date. And from what I remember, I was not the abrasive one."</p><p>"I was <em>not </em>abrasive," Agatha argued, but her protests were cut short by Wanda.</p><p>"I don't mean the bar. Honestly, I was rather impressed by how you managed to get this brick wall to talk to you," Agatha rolled her eyes at the jab. "I'm talking about your coffee date."</p><p>Rio's eyes widened, her eyebrows disappearing into her hairline, and Agatha hung her head in defeat.</p><p>What was the saying? Liar, liar, pants on fire?</p><p>She would much rather have her pants on fire than have to go through this. She would even sacrifice one of her favorite pairs. Hell, watching her entire wardrobe burn seemed better than experiencing this situation.</p><p>"<em>Coffee date?</em>" the unadulterated surprise in Rio's voice made Agatha groan. "There was no coffee date. She didn't even call me after I gave her my number."</p><p>"What?" Agatha could feel both women looking at her despite having her eyes firmly glued to the ground, and she briefly wondered if running away was an option. Then, she remembered Nicky, obliviously playing on the monkey bars with the twins, and sighed. When she lifted her head, she found Wanda's green eyes drilling holes into her face with an accusatory look.</p><p>She flashed her friend her best innocent smile. "So, the date was more of a... creative story?"</p><p>"You lied to me!" Wanda hissed, poking her in the ribs.</p><p>"Hey!" she protested, batting the offending hand away and rubbing the sore spot with a pout. "It was a little white lie!"</p><p>"A white lie?" the redhead scoffed, turning to look at Rio, who had been watching the scene with surprised amusement. "Do you have a problem with Agatha having close female friends?"</p><p>"Um, no? You seem rather lovely," Agatha huffed at the words, still feeling the stinging pain of her friend's finger digging into her ribs.</p><p>"And do you hate children?" Rio laughed, shaking her head as she glanced at Agatha with a smirk.</p><p>"You've been working hard to make me the devil, huh?" she mused before refocusing on Wanda. Agatha hated how much the bartender seemed to enjoy witnessing her downfall. "No, I don't hate children. I can give you one of my aunts' numbers if you don't believe me. I have enough younger cousins to make a football team, and I love spending time with them."</p><p>"I'm going to assume you also don't go to the bathroom to 'probably do cocaine'," the boisterous laughter that erupted from Rio's mouth made Agatha jump in her seat. She felt something comforting wrap around her heart at the sound, coiling tightly around the muscle and enveloping it in a pleasant embrace. She shook the feeling off before it could fully develop.</p><p>"Jesus," Rio wheezed, wiping the tears from her eyes while the giggles still shook her shoulders. "That one was good! Did you just put together your exes' worst qualities or go freestyle? I don't know which one would be better."</p><p>"I'm glad you find this amusing," Agatha said, sarcasm dripping from her voice like venom. She felt exposed, embarrassed, and humiliated by how quickly her lie had fallen apart, and Rio's reaction was not helping the storm of emotions rising in her chest.</p><p>Any normal person would be offended by the slander, but the woman laughed like Agatha had said the funniest joke she heard in a while, and the lawyer did not know what to do with the unusual response. If it were her in Rio's place, she would probably sue for defamation. Meanwhile, Rio took her lies in a good stride, twisting the rather mortifying situation into a hilarious story she would undoubtedly tell her friends.</p><p>"I don't," Wanda's voice held traces of anger, something the kind-hearted redhead rarely displayed. It made Agatha flinch. The road to redemption would be long and unpleasant, she was sure. "I am so sorry, Rio. I should have seen through the story."</p><p>"No worries," the bartender waved her hand dismissively. "Honestly, if my friend told me about a disastrous first date with a person who already hates her friends, children, and snorts coke, I would be <em>way</em> less polite than you were."</p><p>"She can't help it. You could be the devil incarnate, and she would still try to befriend you," Agatha quipped, earning a scoff from Wanda. "Oh, come on, you know I'm right. Remember that horrendous girl Vision used to work with? It took her a year to call you 'Wanda' and not 'Vision's wife', and you still regularly invited her for dinner."</p><p>"Some people aren't good with names," Wanda argued, pointing an accusatory finger at her. "Don't try to change the subject. You're not getting out of this that easily."</p><p><em>"Moi?</em> Change the subject? Never," the redhead narrowed her eyes momentarily before her face split into a sly grin. Agatha barely had the time to open her mouth when Wanda's attention diverted to Rio, her expression so innocent it bordered on fake.</p><p>"Rio, are you busy tonight at, let's say, seven?" the alarm bells in Agatha's head went off all at once at the serene lilt in her friend's voice.</p><p>She had to be joking.</p><p>"Not really. Why?" Agatha wondered if the bartender was this naive or purposefully played into Wanda's narrative to get a reaction out of her. Whichever it was, Agatha had to stop the madness.</p><p>"Need I remind you that you're married, Wanda?" she said, clicking her tongue disapprovingly. "What would poor Vision say?"</p><p>"Well, congratulations! You bagged yourself a date with this walking nightmare," Wanda announced, gesturing to Agatha, who froze in shock. Her eyes jumped to Rio, hoping the woman would interfere, but her expression was clear, a smirk tugging at the corners of her lips.</p><p>Agatha realized the younger woman looked <em>pleased </em>with the outcome of the conversation. Victorious, even, and she scowled.</p><p>"I don't have a babysitter for Nicky," she reasoned, knowing that simply refusing to partake in her friend's shenanigans would not work. Wanda shrugged.</p><p>"I'll take him."</p><p>"It's a school night."</p><p>"I'll drive him if you stay out late. It won't be the first time."</p><p>"I have work tomorrow."</p><p>"I can promise to get you home by ten," Rio interjected, raising her hands when Agatha glared at her. "Nine? When's your bedtime?"</p><p>"Wouldn't you like to know," Agatha grumbled. "Wanda, this is-"</p><p>"You know what I just remembered?" the redhead asked suddenly, leaning back against the bench and sending Agatha a sugary smile. "This rather interesting post I saw on Instagr-"</p><p>"Okay, fine!" Agatha relented, feeling the bitter taste of defeat flood her tongue. Rio and Wanda glanced at each other victoriously, and she scoffed, stifling down the sudden warmth blooming in her chest. It should not be important that the two seemed to get on well. Whatever this thing with Rio was, it would not go beyond the one <em>forced </em>date.</p><p>Agatha looked at the bartender reluctantly, her words coming out in an angry hiss. "I'll send you the address of the restaurant. Don't be late."</p><p>Rio grinned at her, flashing the small gap between her teeth. "Wouldn't dream of it."</p><hr/><p>Agatha stepped out of the Uber in front of the restaurant - a charming, Italian place that Wanda insisted on - at precisely 7 PM, her muscles rigid and expression sour.</p><p>After Rio had left to continue her run, summoned by somebody shouting at her through the ruckus swallowing the park, Wanda had made a show of berating Agatha for the ploy. The scolding lasted for at least fifteen minutes, alternating between dragging out personal stories and preaching about morality, and by the end of it, Agatha was ready to apologize only to make her friend stop talking.</p><p>The hurt look in Wanda's eyes made the apology more sincere than it should have been, considering the situation the redhead had gracelessly pushed her into.</p><p>A date with an insane bartender who offered to marry her within an hour of knowing her.</p><p>Agatha was confident she had to be a prolific serial killer in her previous life to deserve that. She hoped she at least had fun gathering all the bad energy that was now blowing up in her face.</p><p>"Harkness, table for two," she barked at the waiter, not bothering with pleasantries. The man nodded, undeterred by her frosty behavior, and tucked a menu under his arm.</p><p>"Right this way, ma'am," the restaurant was busy for a Monday night, the clattering of utensils against plates filtering through the soft music from the speakers and creating a background for buzzing conversations. Agatha's eyes swept over the patrons, and she realized most of them were couples - exchanging soft touches on the white tablecloths and staring deeply into each other's eyes over the lit candles. They all seemed encapsulated in their impenetrable bubbles, undisturbed by the staff bustling around them and other people's presence.</p><p>Of course, Wanda had to insist on a romantic restaurant straight off a Pinterest board.</p><p>"I was getting worried you stood me up," Rio sat at a table tucked into a corner, away from the other guests, looking at her with an easy smile. Agatha took in her black blazer, noticing the lack of a shirt underneath, and swallowed thickly. The outfit was bordering on inappropriate, with the blazer's first button well under Rio's breasts, showing off her decision to forgo a bra and uncovering miles of tan skin. Agatha’s eyes raked over the delicate lines of a floral tattoo spreading across Rio’s left collarbone – the same tattoo she had noticed peeking out from underneath her sleeve at the bar. A stray thought appeared in her mind, asking to see the entire work, and Agatha snapped out of the daze, forcing herself to look at the woman’s face instead of the tantalizing gap between the blazer’s lapels.</p><p>"Wanda would kill me," she grumbled, shrugging off her jacket and hanging it on the back of her chair as the waiter lit the three candles arranged in the middle of the table. He shot her a polite, almost forced, smile when she opened her mouth to protest the addition to the unnecessarily romantic ambiance.</p><p>"Your date already took care of your drinks. I will be right back with them," the waiter scurried off in long, decisive steps, and Agatha clenched her teeth.</p><p>"Did you tell him this was a date?" she asked the woman, taking her seat and reaching for the menu. Upon not getting a response, she glanced up from the booklet and fell straight into blazing pools of brown.</p><p>Rio's eyes slid appreciatively over the low cut of her dress, burning marks into Agatha's skin as they traced her collarbones and neck. She could feel their touch almost as if it were Rio's fingers reverently gliding over the exposed neckline, mapping out the scarce freckles and imperfections. Rio looked at her like a starved man after seeing a hearty meal for the first time in days, her eyes burning with something Agatha did not dare name.</p><p>"Rio?" she meant to add a teasing edge to her voice, but the name left her lips in a hesitant whisper. She cleared her throat to overcome the sudden tightness gripping it. "Rio!"</p><p>"Ah," the younger woman jumped, her knee hitting the table and making it wobble, and Agatha smirked at the blush dusting her cheeks. "Sorry, what were you saying?"</p><p>"That it's impolite to stare," she said, quirking her eyebrow. "Are you okay? You look... flushed."</p><p>"I didn't tell the waiter we were on a date," Rio deflected quickly, and Agatha relished the shakiness in her hands as she reached to open the menu in front of her. Whatever this thing was, it would not go further than the restaurant, but seeing Rio flustered made having to sit through it slightly better. "But you can't blame him for assuming. You couldn't have picked a more romantic restaurant even if you tried."</p><p>"Wanda picked," Rio laughed at her words, the confidence returning into her gestures and voice instantly despite the pinkness of her cheeks.</p><p>"Of course, she did. She's like a polar opposite of you."</p><p>Agatha scrunched her eyebrows, her eyes falling back on the menu. "Are you saying I wouldn't pick this restaurant for a date?"</p><p>"A date you were forced to attend? Definitely not," Rio did not seem to mind that her presence was not voluntary. Even more, she seemed amused by the situation, and it made Agatha wonder about her intentions. Did the woman believe the dinner would change anything regarding Agatha's decision not to accept the proposal? It had to be the reason behind her enthusiastic acceptance of Wanda's idea. What else could Rio get out of spending her evening eating dinner with a single mother who spent most of their conversation trying to push her away? "I was half expecting you to send me the address to some diner with a one-star average on Yelp."</p><p>"I would if I didn't have to go there with you," Agatha grumbled, her eyes glued to the impressive list of pasta offered by the restaurant. She caught sight of Rio putting down her menu and frowned. "You already know what you're getting?"</p><p>"Spaghetti alla carbonara," the woman answered, shrugging as if it were the most obvious choice. "It's my favorite Italian food. Simple to make but many restaurants cut corners, so it's a good test to see if the place is legit."</p><p>"Look at you, Gordon Ramsay," Agatha closed the menu and turned to the waiter as he placed a glass of red wine in front of her. "I will have the lasagna, and she'll have spaghetti alla carbonara."</p><p>"Of course," he nodded, jotting down the order. "Would you like a starter?"</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to decline, the question clearly directed at her, but Rio interrupted her smoothly. "Yes, actually, how are your arancini?"</p><p>"Delicious," the waiter shot her a polite smile, his eyes jumping between the two as if trying to gauge their relationship. Suddenly, Agatha saw them through his eyes - a forty-year-old woman on a date with somebody in their late twenties, sitting in the darkest corner of a romantic restaurant - and she tensed, not liking the image.</p><p>"We'll take those for the table then," Rio squinted, struggling to read the man's nametag in the dim light. "Thank you, David."</p><p>"I will be right back with them," he promised before glancing at Agatha and walking away. She watched him leave, the unsettling feeling at the bottom of her stomach weighing her down like a ball of lead.</p><p>"You okay?" Agatha reached for her glass, using it to hide the displeased curl of her lips as she looked at the woman. Rio seemed unphased by the waiter's behavior, her posture relaxed and her face smooth outside the subtle, worried crinkle between her eyebrows.</p><p>Agatha shook off the unpleasant guilt swirling in her stomach. Who cared about what some random waiter thought? He did not know anything about either of them, about their situation or the reason for their meeting, and his silent judgment was unwarranted.</p><p>Besides, she never paid attention to what other people thought. Why would she start now?</p><p>"Wouldn't ordering whiskey be easier? You already know a brand I like," Agatha ignored the question, tapping her fingernail against the glass as she took a sip. Familiar notes of cherry and tobacco flooded her tongue, making her sigh softly.</p><p>"I took an educated guess that you wouldn't want hard liquor on a school night," Rio responded, watching her reaction with a pleased smile tugging at her lips. "From what I see, I made the right choice."</p><p>"Chianti is almost always a safe bet," Agatha shot back, unwilling to let the woman win. "I'm surprised you know anything about wines, considering the place you work at."</p><p>"It can't be that bad if it has your brand of whiskey," Rio countered immediately.</p><p>"It's a <em>tolerable</em> brand. Not my favorite, but it can do at dingy bars," the banter came easily. Rio's sharp tongue offered an interesting challenge Agatha usually did not face with newly met people, who tended to scurry away whenever her personality reared its head. Where other strangers cowered and bowed their heads, Rio stood taller, her eyes shining with a teasing question as if to say: 'Is that all you've got?'.</p><p>Agatha hated the part of herself that found the woman's confidence attractive.</p><p>"What <em>is </em>your favorite brand, then?"</p><p>"Balvenie Portwood," Rio whistled softly, but her face lacked the confusion Agatha expected. "You know it?"</p><p>"Well, I <em>am</em> a bartender. The bar may be shitty, but you learn a thing or two about alcohol. For example, the fact that one bottle costs over three hundred dollars," Agatha shrugged at the comment.</p><p>"Quality comes at a price," she said nonchalantly, watching a shadow pass over the woman's eyes. Before she could decipher it, Rio blinked, the signature smirk returning to her lips.</p><p>"I should've known you're a snob," Agatha chuckled, catching the bartender off guard.</p><p>"Being able to afford certain luxuries and using that opportunity is not snobbism. It's life."</p><p>"Simple pleasures, right?" although the words sounded innocent, the glint in Rio's eyes made the innuendo clear, and Agatha scowled, reminded of their predicament.</p><p>The waiter's return saved her the hassle of finding the answer as Rio's attention snapped to the arancini placed strategically between them along with two small plates. She briefly thanked the man, who nodded and disappeared as quickly as he had materialized by their table and busied herself with splitting the dish in half.</p><p>Agatha accepted the plate wordlessly, her fingers accidentally brushing against Rio's and sending a shiver up her arm. The younger woman seemed unbothered by the contact, digging into the rice balls with an eagerness that made a small smile bloom on Agatha's face.</p><p>"So, you're a fan of Italian cuisine?" she asked despite herself, slowly cutting one of the arancini open. The mozzarella dripped from the rich inside, enveloping the prosciutto in a creamy blanket.</p><p>Rio hummed, swallowing her bite before speaking. "It's not my favorite, but it's up there. I got into it when I started college. <em>Cucina povera</em> is helpful when you're, well, poor."</p><p>"You cook?" Agatha's eyes widened at the revelation. She partly expected Rio to be one of those students who lived off takeout and coffee - too cool to learn practical skills.</p><p>"Not that well, but enough to survive," Rio put down her fork, her plate clean aside from a few spare breadcrumbs, and reached for her glass. "Why are you so surprised? I'm on my way to thirty."</p><p>"I know people <em>my</em> age who don't know how to cook," she decided not to disclose that <em>she</em> was one of those people. Since Nicky's birth, her culinary skills had grown significantly, evolving from shitty pasta to casseroles and more complex dishes, but she still lacked in the department - especially when compared to Wanda's natural knack for creating meals out of thin air.</p><p>"I like cooking, it's relaxing. A way to shut off your brain," Agatha wanted to argue, remembering all the pots she had burnt over the years and the stress it had caused her, but Rio did not give her a chance. "What do you do to relax?"</p><p>"Are we playing twenty questions?" she asked, her voice laced with sarcasm, and Rio tilted her head, pondering the question. "We are <em>not</em> playing twenty questions."</p><p>"You offered!"</p><p>"I know you're smart enough to recognize sarcasm," Rio grinned, staring at her expectantly. "I read."</p><p>"What do you like to read?" she shot the woman an unimpressed look. "Come on, would you rather wait for our food in awkward silence?"</p><p>Agatha contemplated the offer, wondering if Rio knew the unappreciated art of staying quiet. She doubted it, and the opportunity to make the woman squirm was too tempting to ignore. So, she shrugged, content to watch Rio roll her eyes, annoyed by the lack of response.</p><p>"Fine, be difficult about this," the woman huffed, draining the last of her wine. "I think you're just embarrassed because you're secretly a fan of romance. The knight-in-shining-armor-rescuing-an-uptight-woman-from-her-mediocre-life kind."</p><p>"A knight in shining armor?" Agatha repeated, curling her lip in disgust. "What gives you the impression that I would like that?"</p><p>"Ah, but you didn't deny the romance part," Rio smirked, flagging the waiter to ask for refills on their drinks, and Agatha raised her eyes to the ceiling, praying for strength. "So, what's your poison? Enemies to lovers? I feel like you would like that."</p><p>"I have no idea what you're talking about," Agatha said honestly, picking up the now full glass. "I'm not an avid reader, either. Between my job and Nicky, there's little time to sit down with a book."</p><p>"Nicky is your son, right?" the lawyer clenched her jaw, realizing she had unknowingly fallen into Rio's trap of getting her to open up. "How old is he?"</p><p>"We're not doing this," she grunted into her wine. She could not blame the alcohol for the lowered defenses this time, only Rio, who was, for some reason, so irritatingly easy to talk to.</p><p>"This?" Rio asked, a crinkle forming between her eyebrows. "Talking?"</p><p>"Getting to know each other. This isn't a date."</p><p>"Your friend seemed to think so," Agatha threw the younger woman a dirty look and Rio pursed her lips, engaging in the silent battle for dominance. They stared each other down for a moment before the waiter reappeared with their food.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her lasagna, feeling conflicted. For all her openness, Rio was a hard person to read, and the lawyer wondered what the woman's motivations for agreeing to dinner were. There was the obvious reason - the most likely one - that Rio hoped to change her mind about the absurd offer of getting married. Agatha also would not put it past her if she did it to watch her squirm and waste her time.</p><p>A small voice at the back of her head whispered something about Rio being interested in her, but she silenced it by roughly pushing it even further back.</p><p>"Why did you agree to do this?" she finally asked, watching Rio calmly swirl her fork in the creamy pasta. The woman barely reacted to the sharp question, hurled toward her like a football aimed at her head, and continued to methodically gather enough food to create a decent bite.</p><p>"Why did <em>you</em>?" Agatha frowned at the easy rebuttal, delivered in an almost offhanded way. The air around their table sizzled as two opposing fronts crashed together over the white tablecloth, Agatha's agitated disposition clawing at Rio's blasé demeanor. They were like fire and ice, creating waves of hot steam that swirled in the space between them.</p><p>A storm was brewing.</p><p>"You know why I'm here," she said sternly, making Rio pause her movements. Brown eyes slid across her face, the candlelight making them seem richer as they met icy blue. "You didn't have to agree to go out with me. You had a choice."</p><p>"You're making it sound like Wanda put a gun to your head," Rio mused, putting down her fork and leaning back in her chair. Their eyes remained connected, jumping together like magnets when the movement threatened to separate them. "Is that the only scenario where you go out with somebody like me? Held at gunpoint?"</p><p>"There was no gunpoint," Agatha bit back. "Answer the question, Rio. Why are you here?"</p><p>"At a fancy dinner with a beautiful, intelligent woman who seems allergic to giving straight answers?" Rio tapped her index finger against her chin, pretending to ponder the question as Agatha tried to fight off the blush threatening to spill over her cheeks. The bartender's easy compliments made her heart stutter, and she clenched her teeth to keep her face passive.</p><p>"Eating dinner that won't lead to anything else."</p><p>"I could ask you the same thing," Rio reached for her wine, long fingers toying with the glass without making a move to pick it up. "I doubt anyone can make you do something you don't want to do. You can keep saying Wanda forced you to be here, but we both know that's not true."</p><p>Agatha's nostrils flared, the last shreds of her patience evaporating. "I won't agree to marry you."</p><p>The words fell between them like anchors, each sinking to the table with a tangible finality, and Agatha noticed the subtle twitch of Rio's eye, a crack in her composed mask. The relaxed aura seeped out of the woman's face through the gap like blood from a fresh cut, leaving her expression unreadable as she studied Agatha.</p><p>"Why?" she asked after a beat of silence, making the lawyer scoff. "And don't give me the 'you're a stranger' excuse."</p><p>"It's not an excuse," Agatha snapped. "It's a reason. A <em>good </em>one."</p><p>"Well, then, why are you here?" Rio circled back in the conversation, almost giving Agatha whiplash. "Why bother sitting through dinner with a stranger you barely tolerate?"</p><p>"Wanda-"</p><p>"That's bullshit, Agatha, and we both know it," she bristled at the rude interruption, but Rio's fuming eyes pinned her in her seat, preventing her from speaking. "You know what I think? I think you're too scared to admit it, but deep down, you're considering it."</p><p>"You're proving my point that we don't know each other."</p><p>"Am I?" Agatha's hold on the utensils tightened, the lasagna forgotten on her plate as she glared at Rio with a scowl. "Why are you so afraid to even <em>consider</em> my offer?"</p><p>"Because it's absurd!" she snarled, almost too loud for the quaint restaurant. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see a few curious patrons turn their heads, and she lowered her voice before speaking again, the words no less sharp. "Were you even listening at the bar? I have a <em>son</em>. He's my priority. How would I explain a stranger moving into our house? How would I fit somebody into my life when it's already stretched thin between work and other responsibilities?"</p><p>"You are not adopting a <em>child,</em> Agatha," Rio growled back, crossing her arms over her chest. Despite the ambient lights in the restaurant, Agatha saw the tendrils in her neck flex as the woman tensed her muscles, annoyance coursing through her body in visible ripples and jolts. "I wouldn't be another mouth to feed and take care of. This would be a business arrangement with a precise termination date."</p><p>"A business arrangement that directly impacts my personal life."</p><p>"Yeah, marriage tends to do that," Rio inhaled slowly, running a hand through her hair before speaking again. Her voice grew softer, the previous edge barely audible as her face settled into a serious mask. "Listen, I can see you care about your son, and I understand agreeing to this would impact him too. You're right, I would have to move in with you, but that doesn't mean uprooting your entire life or messing up Nicky's. I can be your friend who doesn't have a place to stay for a year."</p><p>"Except you're <em>not</em> my friend. You're a stranger who I would have to trust to be near my son," Agatha noticed, not buying into Rio's calmer demeanor and letting her anger run free. "For all I know, you could be a convicted felon or a criminal on the run."</p><p>"Then do a background check," Rio scoffed. "I have nothing to hide, and I'm sure you have the means to dig into my history."</p><p>The offer gave Agatha a pause, her eyebrows scrunching as she looked at the bartender dubiously. "And you'd be okay with that? A stranger examining every part of your life?"</p><p>"If it would put your mind at ease," Rio drummed her fingers against the table, pushing her tongue into her cheek. "I know the proposal is ridiculous and that I seemed dismissive of your holdups at the bar, but I truly understand them. I'm not asking you to agree right away. You don't strike me as the kind of person who walks into anything blind, and I can respect that. What I'm asking is... consider it."</p><p>"If you know it's ridiculous, why are you pushing for it?" Agatha asked, a part of her mind put at ease by Rio's acknowledgment of the absurdity of their situation. Maybe the woman was not as insane as Agatha had initially thought, but simply practical.</p><p>"Because it could benefit us both," Rio repeated the sentiment from the bar calmly, returning to her food. "I'm sure you never had to worry about student loans, but it would be nice not to live with them looming over my head until I die."</p><p>"How can you be sure?"</p><p>"With Evanora Harkness as your mother? I doubt you've ever had to think about money," Agatha froze, her jaw almost dropping to the table at the offhanded comment. She stared at the younger woman in shock, her tongue struggling to form any words, but Rio spared her the effort of asking. "I googled you after the bar. Your mother is ex-senator Harkness, and I was right - she <em>is</em> a bitch."</p><p>Agatha blinked, the image of Rio as the insane, free-spirited bartender slowly crumbling to the ground. The woman was intelligent, which should be a given considering her pursuit of a PhD, but Agatha had met many people with more titles than brains. Being academically inclined did not often translate into everyday life - a person could be a professor and be as useless as a box of wet matches.</p><p>Rio was not like that. Although the initial offer at the bar came spontaneously, now the woman repeated it with the same conviction and more information, making an educated choice.</p><p>If Agatha were not so stubborn, she could have been impressed by the initiative.</p><p>"How much do you know about me?" she asked after the silence stretched between them, interrupted only by the sounds of Rio's fork occasionally scraping the plate.</p><p>"I read a few articles about your mother. It surprises me that she did not outline the gender of your spouse in the clause, considering her views."</p><p>"She knows about my sexuality. Insisting on a man would give me grounds to contest the will," Agatha said immediately, having thought about it too. Evanora was a lot of things, but sadly, stupid was not one of them. "What else?"</p><p>"Your professional background. By the way, Harvard Law? Impressive," Rio smirked again, returning to her laid-back persona as she gestured to Agatha's food. "It's gonna get cold."</p><p>Mindlessly, the older woman reached for the cutlery, cutting into the lasagna without tearing her eyes away from the bartender. "Social media?"</p><p>"No," Agatha frowned. She was over a decade older than Rio, but even <em>she</em> would start stalking somebody by scrolling through their social media. She already <em>had</em>, although she blamed Wanda. "I wanted to check if you weren't lying. Your personal life is none of my business."</p><p>"So, you stalked me to see if I wasn't some crazy lady with a made-up story."</p><p>"Not many people walk into the bar talking about millions. You can never be too careful," Rio shrugged. "After I saw that your mother has that kind of money <em>and </em>seems like the type to pull off something like the clause, I stopped digging."</p><p>"You probably wouldn't find much more," Agatha said after swallowing the bite of - partially cold - lasagna, thinking about her lack of social media presence. The greatest chance Rio had of finding anything about her personal life was checking Wanda's profile, where she had been tagged in multiple posts.</p><p>"That doesn't surprise me. You seem like the kind of person who holds their cards close to their chest," the lawyer hummed in the affirmative, letting the conversation die as she busied herself with the thoughts incoherently bouncing around in her head like escaped tennis balls.</p><p>To her disconcert, all of them revolved around the offer.</p><p>Rio’s case was airtight - a marriage that would secure them a substantial sum of money while simultaneously knocking Evanora off her high horse. Though Agatha did not need the money as desperately as Rio, it would be a significant boost to Nicky’s college fund and his future. Letting the funds slip away to the organizations her mother had chosen - ones that could ultimately make her son’s life more difficult - felt unthinkable. </p><p>At the same time, the steely conviction that Evanora would win no matter what she chose, making her a willing puppet in her game or a helpless observer as the funds slipped through her fingers corroded, falling apart like a house of cards. Her mother had likely never considered the possibility that she would find someone to marry on such short notice - especially someone Evanora could not easily intimidate or discredit. Choosing Rio as her temporary spouse would not just catch her mother off guard; it would enrage her. If Rio’s mere existence was not enough to make Evanora seethe, the fact that she was a woman certainly would, and the idea delighted Agatha more than she cared to admit.</p><p>"I'll consider it," she announced unexpectedly, cutting through the silence. Rio raised her brows at the sudden change of heart, but all Agatha could think of were her next moves.</p><p>She had to dig out everything about Rio to get the full picture of the person she would be legally tied to for a year - her criminal record, financial situation, past employment, and family. Leaving even one stone unturned would be a mistake.</p><p>The drawer in her mind labeled 'possibly insane bartender' would not suffice. Agatha needed an entire cabinet.</p>

<p>Agatha clicked furiously through the documents on her laptop, scanning them with her eyes as they passed through the screen in a whirlwind of information. She had spent most of her afternoon holed in her office, glowering at anyone who dared to interrupt her and calling in favors to gather the records she needed.</p><p>It worked to a degree. Although Agatha did not have too many qualms about slightly <em>bending</em> the law, she knew burning her contacts to research Rio's past would be extreme, even by her standards. Still, knowing the right people significantly sped up the process, and as she listened to Nicky's happy rant about his day at school on their way home, her phone kept lighting up with email notifications. By dinner, she had everything she needed, which led her to the table, glasses perched on her nose, a mug of tea in hand, and a displeased frown tugging on her lips.</p><p>Rio did not even have a single <em>parking ticket.</em> Her record was squeaky clean, containing nothing that could convince Agatha the woman was untrustworthy. She had never been arrested, fined, or even written up by any law enforcement agency - a model citizen who paid her taxes on time, never making any mistakes on her returns. There were no active searches in the area - or the country - matching her description and no indication that she could be in legal trouble. Agatha even checked <em>Interpol's</em> wanted list to see if the woman was not a transnational criminal and came up empty-handed.</p><p>Moving to Rio's finances did not offer anything noteworthy either. The records were scarce, the best her contacts could do without actively breaking the law, but they reflected what Agatha had already known - a mountain of student loans, albeit smaller than she imagined. Her suspicion was that Rio must have had some form of a stipend that partially covered the initial fees but could not last throughout her entire higher education. Still, aside from the student debt, Agatha did not stumble upon anything abnormal that could point to the woman laundering money or running an illegitimate business.</p><p>The last file she had contained more personal information - Rio's biography - and she hesitated, the mouse hovering over the icon, shaking from her unsteady hand. Rio had given her permission to scrutinize her life, but knowing that the woman had refrained from trying to learn anything about Agatha outside of what she needed to verify her words made the situation somewhat unfair in the lawyer's mind. It seemed ridiculous - she had spent the past hour invading Rio's privacy by dissecting her criminal and financial records. Yet, the idea of reading about the woman's family ties, among other things, gave Agatha a pause.</p><p>The information was significant in her quest to consider Rio as a solution to her problem. One's background could not be thoroughly vetted without taking one's beginnings into account; these were the formative years that took root in one's psyche and shaped one. Without learning about them, Agatha could not paint a comprehensive picture of Rio, which left room for error, and a mistake in this situation could come at a great price.</p><p>Still, even thinking about opening the document felt like a despicable invasion of the woman's privacy.</p><p>"Mama? Are you working?" she jolted, the tea precariously sloshing in the mug she held tight between her fingers. Her eyes snapped to Nicky, who had spent the past hour working on a project for class, occasionally asking her questions.</p><p>"It's nothing that can't wait. Do you need help with something?" Agatha peered over her laptop, stifling a groan at the disarray. Nicky had occupied most of the table with cut-outs, crayons, and pieces of paper that gathered in precarious piles around him. She could already imagine his protests at the idea of cleaning the mess.</p><p>"You were talking to yourself," he noticed, his eyes shining with curiosity. "Who is Rio?"</p><p>Agatha paled at the question, wondering how much she had said in her frustrated state. She could only hope her mutterings were child-friendly.</p><p>"She's... a friend of mine," she responded hesitantly, setting the mug down. "I met her a few days ago."</p><p>"Rio is a city," Nicky announced proudly, his project forgotten as he bounced in his chair excitedly. Agatha smiled at the words, enamored by her son's enthusiasm. He was a curious child, which had made him a notorious toddler, but the older he got, the more she appreciated his interest in various fields.</p><p>As challenging as raising an inquisitive child could be, Agatha knew raising an ignorant would have been infinitely worse.</p><p>"Rio de Janeiro, yes. It's a city in Brazil," she offered, watching his eyes widen, the spark of curiosity growing into a blazing fire.</p><p>"Is that why her name is Rio? 'Cause she's from Brazil?"</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, shaking her head. "No, baby. Rio means 'river' in Spanish. That's where her name came from, probably."</p><p>"But you don't know," Nicky argued. "So, it could be because she's from Brazil."</p><p>"She's not from Brazil. She's half Puerto Rican," the boy tilted his head to the side, his eyebrows scrunched in confusion. "Puerto Rico is an American territory. People there speak Spanish."</p><p>"Does Rio speak Spanish?" Agatha recalled the two Spanish words scribbled on the napkin from the bar - <em>te veo.</em> Her knowledge of the language was almost non-existent, especially while sporting an impressive hangover, so she had to Google the meaning. She still did not know why Rio wrote 'I see you' on the note, but it gave her a clue about the woman being bilingual.</p><p>"I think so, yes," Nicky gasped at the revelation, scrambling to kneel on the chair to rise to his mother's eye level. "Don't do that, baby, it's dangerous."</p><p>He obediently sat back down, his legs tucked underneath him. It did not prevent him from almost buzzing from excitement, his eyes bright when he looked at Agatha pleadingly. "Can I meet her?"</p><p>The woman pressed her lips at the question, wondering if it was the right time to discuss the possibility of Rio moving in. She quickly dismissed the idea.</p><p>She had not decided to proceed with the offer yet; the preliminary screening of Rio's past was insufficient preparation. The <em>personal information</em> file still stared at her from the laptop's screen, urging her to uncover as much about the woman as possible, and Agatha looked back at it blankly, mulling over her son's query.</p><p>Opening the file was not necessary to get to know Rio. Agatha knew the younger woman would answer most of her questions without hesitation, especially considering her blessing to dig into her life. It would require Agatha to meet with the bartender again, but in the preview of getting married for a year, she really should not have any qualms about it.</p><p>Agatha dragged her eyes back to Nicky, closing the laptop with an uncertain smile.</p><p>"I'll ask her about coming over for dinner sometime this week. How does that sound?" Nicky nodded quickly, flashing her a toothy grin.</p><p>"Do you think she'll teach me some Spanish?"</p><p>"You'll have to ask," Agatha said. For once, her son's enthusiasm was not infectious, dimmed by the dread coiling in her stomach.</p><p>Was she seriously entertaining the idea of marrying that blasted bartender?</p><hr/><p>She answered her own question a few hours later after putting Nicky to bed.</p><p>Sitting on her bed, her phone in one hand and the crumpled napkin in the other, Agatha thought back to the restaurant. Her agreement to consider Rio's offer had lessened the tension surrounding their table, letting them spend the rest of the meal in near-silence. Rio had stopped probing, either noticing Agatha's mind working overtime to plan her next steps or not wanting to push her to withdraw from the deal on the spot, and Agatha had focused on the cold lasagna and her future. After the meal, they bid their goodbyes in an almost business fashion - with a firm handshake that lingered for a second too long and shot a jolt of electricity up Agatha's arm.</p><p>Still, Rio had the last word as she smirked at Agatha, chivalrously holding the Uber's door open for her.</p><p>
<em>Give me a call, whatever you decide.</em>
</p><p>Rio had left everything in her hands, aware that only Agatha could put their plan in motion. And now, Agatha was about to call her not to agree but to give her the opening to prove herself an eligible suitor.</p><p>Jesus, when did her life become a medieval romance?</p><p>No, there was no romance. <em>If </em>Agatha decided that Rio was up to the task, it would be no more than a business arrangement. The situation was not out of one of those books Rio had falsely accused her of liking.</p><p>Inhaling deeply, Agatha dialed the number and pressed the phone to her ear, squeezing the napkin in her other hand like a stress ball.</p><p>"Hello?" Agatha frowned at the unfamiliar, undoubtedly male voice and dislodged the phone from her ear to quickly check the number. Although she would not put giving out a fake number past Rio, she knew the digits were correct. She had already used them to send the woman the restaurant's address, even though she had not bothered to save them on her phone.</p><p>"Is this Rio's phone?" she asked hesitantly, the wrinkle between her eyebrows deepening at the distant shuffling coming through the receiver.</p><p>"Asshole, how many times did I tell you not to answer my phone without my permission?" Rio's every word sounded closer; the last one hissed straight into Agatha's ear when the woman reclaimed her phone.</p><p>"I thought it was a scammer-"</p><p>"Hello?" Rio's voice blocked out the rest of the man's explanation, still carrying notes of lingering annoyance as she addressed Agatha. "Who is this?"</p><p>"Agatha," she answered cautiously. Something on the call's other end crashed loudly, making her wince as a cacophony of shouts erupted in whatever place Rio was.</p><p>"Shit!"</p><p>"For fuck's sake!"</p><p>"That was my favorite mug!"</p><p>"Is this a bad time?" the vein in Agatha's forehead throbbed furiously, her temples pulsing from the noise. She should have poured herself a glass of wine before the conversation; there was no getting through it sober.</p><p>"No, no, no," Rio said hurriedly, her steps mixing with the annoyed shouts until everything fell silent. Agatha could make out the subtle click of a closing door. "Just my friends being idiots. What's up?"</p><p>"I'm calling about the offer," she started slowly, expecting a joke or a clever remark, but to her surprise, the younger woman stayed silent. "I'd like to meet again to... talk about your personal life."</p><p>"My personal life?" Rio repeated, and Agatha could imagine the scrunch of her eyebrows. "You couldn't dig anything up?"</p><p>"I could. I <em>did.</em> I read your criminal record, or rather stared at a blank page, and a bit about your finances."</p><p>"Is that even legal?" Agatha sat up straighter at the question.</p><p>"You gave me permissio-"</p><p>"Yeah, no, I know. I'm not mad or anything, just surprised you pulled it off," the nonchalant tone of Rio's voice made her relax slightly, although her mind remained on high alert. After all, she did not want Rio to think <em>she</em> was a criminal. "What else do you want to know? If you got a hold of my finances, I guess there's little you couldn't find out."</p><p>"You didn't look into my personal life. I'm trying to be fair," Rio hummed into the speaker, the sound pouring straight into Agatha's ear and making her inhale sharply. She pushed the phone away from herself, keeping it at a safe distance.</p><p>"That's very considerate of you."</p><p>"Yeah, well, I have my moments," she grumbled, clenching her jaw. "So, are you interested?"</p><p>"Is this a roundabout way of telling me you want to go through with the deal?" Rio asked cautiously, her voice measured as if she were purposefully hiding her emotions.</p><p>"No, not without talking first," Agatha countered, getting up from the bed to pace around the room. "We can meet, and you'll tell me about yourself. Then, we can discuss what we expect from the deal."</p><p>"Sounds good," the younger woman agreed, clicking her tongue. "Does that mean I get to ask about you, too?"</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She should have expected Rio to want information in return; the relationship was transactional, a never-ending dance of push and pull. "To a degree."</p><p>"I'll take it," Rio announced, humor lighting up her voice. "When do you want to meet?"</p><p>"Tomorrow? I should have a free hour around noon," the time was not ideal, considering she would have to leave work in the middle of the day, but she had already checked her calendar and realized there were no other options. Meeting after work would mean asking Wanda to collect Nicky from school, which would raise unnecessary questions, and inviting Rio to her house was off the table for the time being.</p><p>"Someone's eager," she scoffed into the phone, not dignifying the jab with an actual answer. "Do you have a place in mind?"</p><p>"I'll send you the address," if Rio had not decided to be a smartass, she could have given her a vote about the location to prevent her from driving across the city. Now, the woman had to deal with the consequences of her actions. "Be there at noon."</p><p>"Of course," Rio laughed at her stern, business-like tone. A distant shout reminded Agatha about another topic she wanted to cover during the call.</p><p>"Also, don't tell your friends about it. If you haven't already."</p><p>"We're not even married yet, and you're already controlling!" the wit behind the words did not soothe Agatha, who scowled, forgetting the woman could not see her. Before she could voice her disapproval of the joke, Rio spoke again, losing the humorous tone. "I haven't told them, and I won't, but I will need a reason."</p><p>"If I decide to go through with it, I'll give you one," Agatha said impatiently, walking a trench into her polished, wooden floors. "Tomorrow."</p><p>"It's a date!"</p><p>"Bye," she deadpanned, hanging up the call before the woman could answer and throwing the phone on the bed. The device bounced precariously on the covers, but Agatha did not pay it any mind, running her hand through her hair. She deserved a glass of wine after that.</p><hr/><p>"And where are you going?" Agatha suppressed a groan as Lilia joined her in the elevator, lustrating her coat and purse.</p><p>After maneuvering through the office without bumping into one of the other partners, she hoped to leave the building unnoticed, but Lilia had an annoying habit of knowing things she should not know. It made her an excellent lawyer and businesswoman; her intuition when it came to picking cases and noticing angles to work with was unmatched by anyone Agatha had ever worked with. Still, the trait was less admirable when one became Lilia's friend.</p><p>Agatha would classify it as a pain in the ass.</p><p>"Lunch," she answered sternly, punching the button to close the door. Lilia's eyes on her felt like lie detectors, relentlessly scanning for the truth, and Agatha was thankful she had years of experience withstanding the older woman's scrutiny.</p><p>"I’ve known you for over a decade, and I've never seen you take lunch outside the office unless it was with a client," Lilia noticed, her voice light as if they were discussing the weather. Agatha did not let it lull her into a false sense of security as she schooled her face into an indifferent mask, offering the woman a disinterested shrug.</p><p>"And how do you know I'm not meeting a client?"</p><p>"I checked," Agatha glanced at the display showing the current floor and clenched her teeth. For such a modern building, the elevator really should be faster. "You don't have any meetings scheduled for the rest of the day."</p><p>"You have to stop harassing my assistant for information about me," Lilia laughed, shaking her head in amusement. Agatha decided to change her approach. "Where are <em>you</em> going?"</p><p>"Well, I <em>was</em> going to the other floor," the woman leaned against the wall, crossing her arms over her chest. "But now that you've mentioned lunch..."</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth, aware that her friend was fishing for a reaction and unwilling to give her one. "I don't remember inviting you."</p><p>"No need, I invited myself," Lilia flashed her a smug smile. "Where are you thinking?"</p><p>"I'm thinking that I'd rather eat alone," she said through gritted teeth. "You're not even wearing your coat. Or have your purse."</p><p>"I run hot, and you can pay," Agatha scoffed, her eyes darting to the diminishing number on the display. She had ten floors to maneuver her way out of this.</p><p>"Shouldn't you be working on the Noval case?" Lilia waved her hand dismissively, her colorful bangles jingling cheerfully on her wrist, distracting Agatha from the red number '6' flashing above the door.</p><p>Maybe the elevators were <em>too</em> fast.</p><p>"I have the associates on it. Something to keep them busy while I'm eating lunch," the woman looked at her as if waiting for her to protest, and Agatha weighed her options. Lilia would not let go unless given a satisfying reason, and going with her to lunch before meeting Rio was impossible, considering the time restraints. Bringing Lilia <em>along</em> was an even worse idea.</p><p>There was only one solution - to lie.</p><p>"I'm not going to lunch," Agatha admitted slowly, careful to keep her voice hesitant like a child confessing to eating a cookie before dinner. Lilia quirked an eyebrow, a knowing look on her face, and Agatha wet her lips with her tongue, searching for appropriate words. "I have an errand to run."</p><p>"An errand?" Lilia repeated, her voice dripping with disbelief. "In the middle of a work day?"</p><p>"I'm using my lunch break for it," she said defensively, knowing that was not the detail Lilia cared about. When Agatha had first joined the company, maybe the older woman would have given her a hard time over tending to personal affairs during office hours; however, after she had become a partner, Lilia rarely voiced her opinion on Agatha's work ethic. If anything, she berated her for working <em>too much.</em></p><p>"Is everything alright?" the worried notes playing in Lilia's voice reflected in her expression as the wrinkle between her eyebrows deepened, cutting into the tan skin.</p><p>"It's just a doctor's appointment," the crease grew. "Nothing serious, a regular check-up."</p><p>The elevator stopped, and Agatha stepped toward the opening doors, delighted when Lilia did not move to walk out with her. "Well, I'm not joining you for a doctor's appointment," she declared.</p><p>"And here I was, thinking you'd hold my hand through it," Agatha said sarcastically, her heels clicking on the lobby's tiled floor. She glanced at her watch, noticing it was already noon, and shot Lilia one last look. "I should be back in around an hour."</p><p>As she walked away, Agatha could feel Lilia's curious eyes digging into the back of her neck. There was no way the woman had believed her, but Agatha had more pressing matters to attend.</p><p>The café she had chosen for the meeting was only a block away from the office - a walking distance to not waste time in traffic but not upscale enough to risk a chance of running into anyone from work there. Considering her reputation at the office, Agatha doubted anyone would actively call her out on tending to personal affairs on the clock as everyone usually stepped out of her way. Still, whispers carried like a disease, and they would undoubtedly reach Lilia or Jen, who had no qualms about interrogating her, especially after the elevator.</p><p>Agatha could only hope the café was as unimpressive as it had seemed on the website, unfit even for the interns, who - ironically - appeared to have more expensive tastes than partners these days. Though she doubted they could actually afford those tastes.</p><p>She walked in long, decisive steps, aware that she was on a tight schedule and late for the meeting. Her blue coat blew behind her like a cape, occasionally hitting other pedestrians who sent her dirty glares, but she did not pay them any mind. The prepared list of questions she wanted to ask Rio rested in her notes app, more of an assurance than necessity since she had learned them by heart. They were nothing fancy, mostly revolving around the woman's upbringing, dating history, and general past.</p><p>Agatha would never admit it out loud, but many came from a random website titled: 'Things to know about your partner before tying the knot.', which she had visited for inspiration. Although most of the proposed questions revolved around uninteresting topics like favorite ways to spend free time or hopes for the future - a part of her mind yearned to know those things about Rio, but Agatha ignored it - the author had a few intriguing propositions she had promptly committed to memory.</p><p>With the website and her own ideas, Agatha had come up with a satisfying list of need-to-know issues that she planned to bombard Rio with. She hoped it would suffice to fill the hour and limit the woman's chances of asking anything back.</p><p>The café emerged around the corner as bland as it had looked in the photos, and Agatha checked her watch. Five minutes late. She promptly pushed at the door, letting the soothing aroma of coffee and pastries flood her nostrils as warmth seeped through her clothes, chasing out the cold still clinging to the air as winter neared its end.</p><p>Her eyes swept the scarce customers occupying some of the chairs and couches, mostly hunched over laptops as they absentmindedly sipped on their beverages before gravitating toward Rio. The woman noticed her immediately, offering her a lopsided smile and a beckoning wave of her hand. Agatha bit the inside of her cheek before striding across the café to sit on the chair opposite her.</p><p>"Do you always make it a point to show up a few minutes late?" Rio asked her instead of a greeting, tapping her finger against her phone to check the time. "Is it a power move or something?"</p><p>"Good things come to those who wait," Agatha countered, hanging her coat over the back of her chair. "Do you always start conversations with a question instead of a hello?"</p><p>"Hello. How are you?"</p><p>"We're not here for small talk," Rio chuckled at the sharp words. "Where were you born?"</p><p>"Jesus, you won't even let me buy you a coffee first?" Agatha clenched her teeth. She could almost hear the ticking clock as the seconds slipped through her fingers.</p><p>"We don't have time for that. I only have an hour."</p><p>"Even less now that you've decided to be late," Rio joked, her eyes moving across the café to rest on a piece of paper tacked to one of the walls. Agatha followed her line of sight, groaning in annoyance at the message printed in bold, black letters. "Looks like they only let customers occupy their tables. So, what can I get you?"</p><p>"I already had coffee at the office."</p><p>"A tea then? Chamomile, maybe?" Agatha frowned at the offer.</p><p>"Are you suggesting I need to relax?" the younger woman shrugged, already getting up from the table, phone in hand. Her eyes bore into Agatha's face, waiting for an answer. "I don't want anything to drink."</p><p>"Something to eat? I assume this is your lunch break," Agatha impatiently drummed her fingers against the table, a growl forming at the back of her throat.</p><p>"We're wasting time," her phone lit up with a notification as if on cue, making her realize they had burned through ten minutes of the meeting on meaningless banter. "Get whatever you want. Just be quick."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am," Rio gave her a faux salute and moved to the counter, flashing the bored barista a smile. Agatha turned her attention to her phone, checking if the message pertained to anything urgent. With her luck, she would not be surprised if everything at the office suddenly required her expertise, urging her to cut the engagement short before it had started.</p><p>Her eyes skimmed through the email, noticing the attached document for her review. Of course, she had waited her entire morning for the contract, and the client decided to send it over <em>now.</em> She locked her phone with a displeased huff.</p><p>"Everything alright?" Rio set a cup of steaming tea in front of her, along with a chocolate muffin.</p><p>"I told you I didn't want anything," she noticed, eyeing the pastry distrustingly before looking at the woman sitting opposite her. Rio busied herself with putting an outrageous amount of sugar in what Agatha presumed to be a simple black coffee, offering her a distracted shrug.</p><p>"It's not poisoned. And you look like you could use some serotonin," Rio took a tentative sip and hummed in satisfaction, her hand wrapping around the mug as she glanced at Agatha. "I was born in New York but moved to Florida when I was seven. I lived there until I left for college."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"I got into Harvard," the younger woman pointed to the muffin. "Eat."</p><p>"Why did you move to Florida?" Agatha prodded, ignoring the order. If not for the ticking clock, she would have growled at Rio for trying to boss her around, but she did not have the time for another push and pull.</p><p>"Eat," realizing Rio would not budge, she clenched her teeth and tore a small piece of the pastry away, putting it in her mouth. The chocolate melted on her tongue instantly, its quality surprisingly good for the place they were at. She looked at the bartender expectantly. "I moved to live with my abuela."</p><p>"Is getting information out of you always like pulling teeth?" Agatha growled, annoyed by Rio's newfound reluctance to talk. They only had forty-five minutes to get through the long list of questions she had prepared, and the woman seemed hellbent on making the conversation as complicated as possible.</p><p>"I agreed to answer questions, not to delve into the details," Rio countered, and Agatha raised her brows at the defensive tone, noticing the guarded look in brown eyes.</p><p>"It's between this and reading your file," she said pointedly, watching Rio's expression like a hawk. Something about the subject made the woman uncomfortable, and in light of their predicament, Agatha could not let it go, her mind running wild with the worst-case scenarios.</p><p>Realistically, she knew that Rio could not be involved in any criminal activity as more than a spectator at that age, but her family <em>could.</em> The possibility was worrisome, which meant Agatha had to overlook Rio's discomfort and dig deeper.</p><p>"This won't work if you keep answering like I'm forcing you to be here. <em>You</em> pressed me to consider the offer, and this is a condition I won't budge on," Agatha crossed her arms over her chest, scrutinizing the woman sternly. "If something in your history could affect me, I need to know about it."</p><p>The bartender's jaw jumped, her mouth pressing into a thin line. "Me moving as a seven-year-old doesn't concern you. It was twenty years ago."</p><p>"And yet, you don't want to talk about it," Agatha reached for the tea, deciding that she <em>could</em> use something to relax, with Rio's irritated air giving her a headache. "Why did you move to live with your grandmother? What happened to your legal guardians? Did they go to prison?"</p><p>She realized her mistake when Rio's face twisted, her eyes narrowing and lips trembling in barely contained rage as she glared at Agatha so scaldingly the older woman recoiled in her chair. Rio's mug shook in her hands, her knuckles turning white from the force of her grip, and her following words fell on Agatha like a slap.</p><p>"Is that your first guess? One look at me, and you decided my parents had to go to prison?" Rio's snarl attracted the barista's attention, but Agatha felt trapped in the furious flames burning in Rio's eyes, unable to look away to glare at the noisy woman. "Would it put your mind at ease to find out they died in a car crash? With me in the back seat, aware of what was happening but unable to stop it? And then I got shipped halfway across the continent; my entire life uprooted by a drunk driver?" Rio leaned forward, the drawstrings hanging off her green hoodie swiping across the table. "Tell me, Agatha, does being married to an orphan go against your perfect life?"</p><p>Agatha gawked at her, each word sinking deep into her chest, carried by the hurt and anger painted across Rio's face like a haunting portrait in the most prestigious gallery in the world. It sharpened her features, adding blush to her cheeks and taunt lines to her expression, making her look almost feral.</p><p>"I-" Agatha stammered, feeling smothered by the gravity in Rio's almost black eyes, the fury sucking out the warm brown. She opened her mouth again, fighting for air as it evaded her lungs, stifled by Rio's anger. "It doesn't."</p><p>"Did I make you uncomfortable?" Rio asked, her tone turning the question into a mocking remark. It made Agatha snap out of the guilt clouding her mind.</p><p>"No," she busied herself with the muffin, letting an indifferent mask smooth out her face. "The death of your parents does not make you any less credible."</p><p>"Well, that's a relief," Rio scoffed, her words sharp with sarcasm as she leaned back in her chair, her arms secured around her chest like a protective barrier. Agatha looked at the display with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>"If you don't want to talk about your past, you don't have to, but it means the deal is off the table," she said before putting another piece of the pastry in her mouth. "You are free to walk away from this conversation."</p><p>Rio hesitated, and Agatha's heart sank. She had taken the bartender's involvement in the scheme as a safe bet, only focusing on her own holdups and not considering that the woman could drop out as quickly as her. It made sense. Rio had been the one to keep pushing, not letting her conviction falter as she agreed to whatever Agatha asked of her, so the idea that the woman would walk away from the deal did not even cross Agatha's mind.</p><p>Now, the possibility struck her like a bolt of lightning, brought on by the uncertainty in Rio's eyes. Before she could spiral any further, the bartender spoke again, her voice detached and cold.</p><p>"No. I'm not giving up because you don't have any manners. But don't make assumptions about my life. You don't know anything about it," Agatha wanted to argue and remind the woman that she had already examined her finances and criminal record, putting everything under a magnifying glass to find anything concerning. Instead, she nodded a short, jerky move to signify her understanding.</p><p>Rio looked at her for a second before untangling her arms and reaching for her coffee. "What else?"</p><p>"Are you close with your family?" the second question in her script referred to Rio's parents, but she decided not to ask anything about them; as callous as it sounded, she did not have a reason to know about the dead people in the woman's life. Her reluctance was certainly <em>not</em> motivated by the visible pain the topic had caused.</p><p>"As close as I can be while in a different state. We call and text, and I visit whenever I have some time on my hands, but it's not often."</p><p>"You don't have any family here?" Agatha frowned, remembering Rio's comment about loving spending time with her cousins. She imagined they would be close-knit, at least living in the same state.</p><p>"I have an aunt in New Jersey - my dad's sister. His family is from New York, but she's the only one left. My ma's side is divided between Florida and Puerto Rico," Rio drummed her fingernails against her mug, her tone void of emotions. "That's blood relatives, at least. I have a few stateside friends that I consider my family."</p><p>"The ones I heard on the phone?" something about Rio's detached tone made Agatha uneasy. The impersonality should not bother her; Rio did what she asked by answering the questions, but her indifference made the conversation feel like a job interview. Agatha hated job interviews.</p><p>"Yeah. I live with Alice, the other bartender you met. The guys were Billy and Eddie."</p><p>"How did you meet?" the question was a diversion from her original plan, but Agatha let her curiosity win. Besides, if Rio was closer to her friends than her family, they were more important to know about.</p><p>"I met Alice and Billy in our first year of college, and we've been close ever since. Eddie is a new addition to the group, joined about a year ago when Billy finally asked him out," an amused spark lit up Rio's eyes, and Agatha latched onto it hungrily, relieved by the break in her coldness.</p><p>"Are they PhD students as well?"</p><p>"Alice is. She's in classical music, concentrating on the piano. Billy is an assistant at some firm, and Eddie... does something with numbers. No idea what, though," Rio shrugged. "Will you dig into their lives as well?"</p><p>"Should I?" Agatha asked, considering the idea. It would be beneficial to check if Rio's friends had anything worrisome in their backstories that could lead to complications. Minimalizing the risk of an unpleasant surprise further into the agreement was the main goal of the conversation, after all.</p><p>"I'd prefer you didn't, but I doubt you care about my opinion," the chill was back, freezing the edges of Rio's words into icicles as they pierced Agatha's skin.</p><p>"As long as they don't drag you into anything dubious, I won't," she said quickly, hoping the words would stave off the cold. Rio nodded, relaxing in her chair slightly. Agatha exhaled softly before asking the next question. "Do you, or anyone from your family, suffer from mental illness?"</p><p>"Not that I know of."</p><p>"Do you support your family financially?" Rio laughed hollowly.</p><p>"I can barely support <em>myself</em>."</p><p>"Does your family help <em>you</em> then?"</p><p>"No, they have enough on their plates," Agatha raised an eyebrow, a silent signal to elaborate. "It's not crime-related if that's what you think. Or debt-related. Not many people can live comfortably in this economy."</p><p>The lawyer ignored the subtle jab. "Do you have any other jobs outside of bartending?"</p><p>"Shouldn't you know that from my finances?" Rio frowned before a look of understanding washed over her. "Ah, you mean under-the-table stuff. No, I don't. I can barely fit bartending and studying into my life."</p><p>"Any medical issues I should be aware of?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Abuse of alcohol or any other substance?"</p><p>"No," Agatha glanced at her watch. With ten minutes left, she had to deal with the information she gathered, only one last question remaining.</p><p>"Are you romantically involved with anyone?" Rio blinked in surprise, taken aback by the insinuation.</p><p>"Why on earth would I agree to marry you while in a relationship?" in her peripheral vision, Agatha noticed the barista raise her brows, sending them a curious look that melted into fear under the lawyer's glare.</p><p>"Every relationship is different. Some people would not mind our arrangement when confronted with the financial benefits," Agatha shrugged, turning her attention back to the conversation and finishing her tea. "And while we're on this topic, I'd also like to know about any crazy exes you might have."</p><p>Rio stared at her, visibly fighting off a smile tugging at her lips. Her anger seemed to have dispersed, and Agatha quickly put it in the 'pros' column on her mental list. She was used to making other people annoyed with her, both because of her personality and profession, which she usually did not care about. Pleasing people with sugary words and fake smiles was not her style, and if somebody did not like her honesty, they had no business talking to her.</p><p>Still, Rio was not another fool at the firm or an annoying stranger at the grocery store. Their coexistence would impact Agatha’s home – Nicky’s <em>life</em> – even if only for a year. After withstanding her mother’s fury for years, the idea of letting somebody as prone to it as Evanora into her life made her nauseous. If Rio could look past her anger after Agatha’s misguided assumption about her parents, the lawyer doubted it would be an issue.</p><p>"I'm not romantically involved with anyone, and there are no crazy exes."</p><p>"Good, because I'd rather not get stalked after marrying you," Agatha sighed, scratching her chin. They were out of time. "I have to go back to work."</p><p>"Just like that?" Rio scrunched her eyebrows. "Do I not get an answer? Or to ask my own questions?"</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek as she reached for her coat. Despite the initial bumps, the conversation had gone well, and Rio's answers had not raised any red flags she would have to consider. Still, one last issue remained.</p><p>"I'd like you to meet my son before I agree to anything," she disclosed, watching Rio for a reaction - a displeased jump of her jaw or an annoyed twitch of her eye - but the woman merely nodded.</p><p>"That's fair. I'm free tomorrow for dinner or during the day on Saturday," Agatha mulled over the options. The days were slipping through her fingers, her fortieth birthday looming over her head like a dark cloud threatening to bring rain any minute. They had to move through the arrangement swiftly.</p><p>"Tomorrow is fine. I'll text you the address to my house," she stood up, pulling on her coat and tossing her bag over her shoulder. Her phone buzzed on the table, Lilia's name flashing across the screen, and she groaned. That could not be good. "I have to go."</p><p>"Sure," Rio shrugged as Agatha snatched the phone, mentally preparing for the bad news that the conversation would surely bring.</p><p>"I'll see you tomorrow at five," she tossed over her shoulder, picking up the call. Rio's amused goodbye followed her out of the café.</p>

<p>"Shit!" Agatha hissed when her fingers brushed against the hot pan, missing the spoon as the doorbell made her jump. Waving her hand to soothe the unpleasant ache tingling in her fingertips, she glanced at her phone to check the time.</p><p>5 PM on the dot. Rio was nothing if not punctual.</p><p>"I'll get it!" Nicky shouted from the dining room, where she had sent him to set the table. Agatha quickly turned off the stove, rushing after the excited patter of feet against the floors. Before she even rounded the corner, she heard the door unlock and open.</p><p>"Oh, hello!" Rio's voice reached her through the corridor, notes of surprise and amusement giving it a cheerful lilt. "You must be Nicky."</p><p>"Nicholas, what did I tell you about opening the door?" Agatha narrowed her eyes at the boy the second he appeared in her sight, momentarily forgetting about their guest. Nicky sent her a nervous smile, stepping toward the woman still standing on the threshold as if hoping she would back him up.</p><p>"I knew it was Ms. Rio," he argued. "You let me open it when it's Aunt Wanda!"</p><p>"Aunt Wanda has <em>a key</em>," Agatha ran a hand over her face, sighing tiredly. "Get back to setting the table."</p><p>"Okay!" Nicky bolted out of the hall, probably relieved by the lack of safety lecture, and Agatha shook her head, focusing on Rio.</p><p>"He's excited," she said, motioning for the woman to enter. Rio obliged, shutting the door behind her with a soft click and cutting off the stream of chilly air entering the house. "Has been nagging me to meet you since I told him your name."</p><p>"My name?" Rio quirked an eyebrow, shrugging off her coat before hanging it over one of Agatha's. Her cheeks were flushed from the cold, her hair slightly tousled from the wind as if she had spent longer outside than the short walk up the driveway. "What about it?"</p><p>"He's convinced it's related to Rio de Janeiro and won't listen to me when I say it's not," Agatha explained, earning an amused chuckle.</p><p>"How do you know it's not?" the woman laughed, her voice slightly strained as she bent in half to undo her shoelaces and slide off her shoes. Agatha's eyes involuntarily traveled up the long legs covered by loose, black slacks, reaching the hem of a white button-up shirt tucked neatly behind the waistband. Compared to the jeans and hoodie Rio had worn to their meeting at the cafe, the clothing looked almost formal, like something Agatha would wear to work.</p><p>"Well, is it?" she asked distractedly, her gaze raking over the woman's effortless elegance.</p><p>"No, it's from the Spanish word 'river.' My full name translates to 'the River of Life,'" Rio straightened her spine, tossing the backpack Agatha had not noticed before over her shoulder. "You done ogling me?"</p><p>Agatha blinked, blushing at the teasing tone that worsened when their eyes locked, and Rio pushed her tongue against her cheek, tilting her head to the side.</p><p>"I'm just surprised you wear anything other than ripped jeans, t-shirts, and hoodies," she said, too quickly for the casual shrug to cover the pinkness tinting her face. If Rio thought about the restaurant too - about that <em>sinfully </em>daring blazer - she did not say anything, her lips curving into an already familiar smirk.</p><p>"For the first time, you're the underdressed one," Agatha glanced down at herself, self-consciously noticing the apron still tied around her waist.</p><p>It was one of her most prized possessions, with Nicky's handprints resting among the splatters of paint covering the front pocket directly over her navel. She still remembered the overwhelming tightness in her throat when her son had gifted it to her along with a card for Mother's Day, excitedly talking about the symbolism of each color and the process of making the project in kindergarten.</p><p>"You didn't have to dress up for this," she said, moving back toward the kitchen. Rio followed her almost soundlessly, the only indicator of her steps being the soft creaking of wood under her feet. "It's just dinner," she added.</p><p>"Bold of you to think I dressed up for <em>this</em>," Rio laughed again, taking a seat at the island as Agatha busied herself with adding the last touches to the risotto, the dish's origin unrelated to her guest's fondness of Italian foods<em>.</em> "I had a presentation about my research and was told I should look the part."</p><p>"What's your research about?" her circle of friends consisted mainly of other lawyers, Wanda being the only exception, and she felt intrigued by Rio's field of study.</p><p>"The role of polyphenols in delaying plant decay and their potential in natural preservatives," the younger woman recited effortlessly, probably used to the question, and smiled gently at the confusion on Agatha's face. "It's about taking natural preservatives from plants that decay slower and implanting them in others to prolong their lifespan."</p><p>"Ah," the lawyer nodded, taking off her apron and tossing it on the counter. "Why did you choose that topic?"</p><p>To her surprise, Rio shook her head and slid off the stool, rummaging through her backpack as she spoke. "It's my turn to ask questions tonight."</p><p>"I'm making a polite conversation," Agatha scoffed, watching the woman's movements. "Don't tell me you wrote down a list."</p><p>"Nope," with a satisfied grin, Rio pulled out a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates from the backpack and gently placed them on the counter. "I hope the wine is up to your standards."</p><p>"And the chocolates?" Agatha eyed the gifts curiously, reading the bottle's label - not top-shelf but still pricey - before moving to the pralines. They were simple, divided into five rows by colorful wrappers announcing the flavors.</p><p>"Don't be greedy. They're for Nicky," Rio put the backpack on the seat she had occupied and shot her a grin. "I didn't know what he would like, so I figured chocolate was the safest bet."</p><p>"You didn't have to do that," Agatha said, her throat tightening with the rush of affection exploding in her chest. For some reason, Rio's thoughtfulness made her almost uncomfortable, like it crossed an unspoken line between a business arrangement and something more - something Agatha did not want to acknowledge.</p><p>She quickly shook off the weird sensation. Although rare, small tokens of gratitude were not abnormal in her world; many clients bought her wines, chocolates, or flowers after closed cases in appreciation of her work. Usually, they followed the end of a partnership, but still.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond - with a teasing remark, surely - but Nicky walked into the kitchen before she could get the words out.</p><p>"Mama, are we eating soon? I'm hungry," his eyes swept over the counter, lighting up as they landed on the box. "Chocolates!"</p><p>"After dinner," Agatha said reflexively, making the boy pout. Her stern expression broke at the adorable display, and she ruffled his hair, pointing to the stove. "Which is <em>ready</em>, don't worry<em>.</em> Take Rio to the dining room."</p><p>"Okay!" the pout melted around an excited grin as Nicky grabbed the woman's hand, dragging her out of the kitchen. Rio let out a startled yelp but let him guide her. "Are you from Brazil?"</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the question, a smile tugging at the corners of her lips when Rio laughed, patiently repeating the explanation she had given her minutes before. Their chatter disappeared down the hall, Nicky's enthusiasm mixing with Rio's calmer but no less eager voice as she patiently satiated the boy's curiosity.</p><p>It boded well for the deal.</p><hr/><p>During dinner, Agatha stepped back from the conversation, letting her son interrogate Rio about her life. She chewed on her food mechanically, barely registering the taste as she watched the interaction, observing her son's body language and expression.</p><p>Her main concern about accepting the deal was bringing chaos into Nicky's life. Inviting a stranger to live with them for a year would cause a shift in the household; even though Rio would not be more than a person occupying the guest bedroom, she would still be present in the common areas. The brewing entanglement of their lives was uncharted territory, and Nicky's comfort was the most important.</p><p>Would her son see Rio's sudden presence as an infringement on his safe space? Would he oppose the idea?</p><p>Agatha knew she would not go through with the deal if he did.</p><p>So, she sat back and watched, fishing for the slightest discomfort on Nicky's part as he showered Rio with relentless questions, hanging onto her every word.</p><p>She watched her son's eyes sparkle with the familiar, untamed curiosity as Rio spoke about her research, keeping her words simple enough for a ten-year-old to understand but using a tone as serious as if she were talking to a fellow student.</p><p>She watched him lean in, mesmerized when the woman effortlessly switched to Spanish per his request during her speech about her friends, her voice taking on a softer lilt.</p><p>She watched him almost jump in his chair when she mentioned Minecraft, apparently Rio's favorite video game.</p><p>She watched Rio charm her son almost effortlessly, all with a patient smile and a relaxed posture as if entertaining him was a privilege and not a means to an end, and something in her stomach tightened.</p><p>"Mama, can I show Ms. Rio my Minecraft world?" two pairs of brown eyes focused on her simultaneously - one pleading, the other amused - snapping her out of her thoughts. Agatha glanced at the empty plates and glasses, realizing she had not spoken once throughout the entire meal, too caught up in her own thoughts.</p><p>"We should probably clean up first," she said after regaining her composure, shooting her son a warning look when he opened his mouth to protest.</p><p>"Okay," he grumbled, sliding off his chair and gathering his plate to carry it to the kitchen. When he disappeared, Agatha glanced at Rio, who moved to collect the rest of the dirty dishes.</p><p>"You know, the lack of plants in your house is worrisome," the woman stated, expertly stacking the glasses before Agatha could protest. "Are you allergic to greenery or something?"</p><p>"More like greenery is allergic to <em>me</em>," she snatched the plates and cutlery, feeling weird about letting Rio clean up the table as a guest. "If plants had souls, this house would be crowded with vengeful ghosts."</p><p>"Ah, so you're a plant murderer," Rio clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth, shaking her head in disappointment. "How are you not in jail?"</p><p>"I know amazing lawyers," Agatha shot back without thinking, falling into the familiar bickering like it was her second nature. The younger woman's ability to match her energy was as uncanny as it was dangerous, each quick remark drawing her in like a moth to the flame.</p><p>Despite the few meetings, Rio was still a <em>stranger.</em> Playful banter should not feel that comfortable. It should not be <em>a thing.</em></p><p>Something in the kitchen clattered to the floor, causing Agatha's senses to sharpen. Her eyes left Rio's to turn toward the sound, her heart speeding up from the sudden rush of adrenaline coursing through her veins.</p><p>"I'm okay! Just a fork!" Nicky shouted through the house, easing the fear rising in her chest. She looked back at the woman, remembering the dinner, and bit the inside of her cheek.</p><p>"You don't have to entertain him," she said quietly so the boy would not hear her. "With the game, I mean. He'll talk your ear off if you let him."</p><p>"He already did that," Rio laughed. "And it's not a problem. I love Minecraft."</p><p>Agatha frowned at the confession. She had spent many hours listening to Nicky ramble about the game and letting him show her whatever he had built, but she did not understand how an adult could find it entertaining.</p><p>It was based in a world made of <em>squares</em>, for crying out loud.</p><p>"I just- you don't have to <em>pretend</em> to be into what he likes," she clarified, grabbing the empty water pitcher. "Your stand on his favorite video game doesn't affect anything."</p><p>"You think I lied about liking Minecraft for brownie points?" Rio said slowly, balancing the empty glasses in one hand while the other pushed back a stray lock of hair from her face. "Do you see me as an evil mastermind?"</p><p>"Pretending to like a video game is not that genius," Agatha rolled her eyes, moving toward the kitchen. "But I respect the ploy."</p><p>"There's no <em>ploy</em>," Rio followed her, offended by the insinuation. "I genuinely <em>like</em> Minecraft and want to see Nicky's world."</p><p>"Aren't you a bit too old for video games?" she quipped, seemingly unable to stop herself from attacking the woman.</p><p>"I don't think you should talk about age here."</p><p>Agatha almost stumbled over her feet at the comment, scowling at Rio's self-satisfied smirk. She remembered the waiter from the restaurant - the silent judgment as if she were a pervert taking advantage of a young, naive woman - and grit her teeth. Rio <em>was</em> young, at least by Agatha's standards, but by no means was she gullible, not with that <em>damn</em> smirk indicating she knew precisely how to strike a nerve.</p><p>Although the thirteen-year gap between them was never an issue for Agatha - a business arrangement did not rely on <em>age</em> - the woman's joke surprised her. Rio seemed amused by the fact, as if the age difference meant nothing to her either, and Agatha realized that another point on her shrinking mental list of holdups had been crossed out.</p><p>Caring for what other people thought did not ascribe to her life philosophy. Apparently, Rio's stance was similar.</p><p>"Can I turn on the game now?" Nicky asked, pointing to the opened dishwasher and the precariously placed plate he had stuffed into it.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, searching the woman's face for any sign of protest. Upon seeing an eager smile stretching the shapely lips, she nodded. "Go ahead, but only to show Rio... whatever you want to show her. You still have homework."</p><p>"But-" she raised an eyebrow, daring her son to argue. "Fine."</p><p>"He is a surprisingly compliant ten-year-old," Rio noticed after Nicky had fled the kitchen. Agatha hummed, busying herself with righting the dishwasher before putting in the rest of the dishes.</p><p>"You caught him on a good day. Usually, there is a lot more fussiness and huffing involved."</p><p>"He seems like a nice kid. Intelligent," hesitation crept into Rio's voice, making Agatha look at her curiously.</p><p>"What?" she urged when the woman did not say anything, seemingly uncomfortable as she stood by the kitchen island, her eyes darting around the space and avoiding Agatha, who frowned at the behavior. "Spit it out," she added, closing the dishwasher and crossing her arms over her chest with an impatient huff.</p><p>Rio's gaze fell on her, the usual confidence gone from her posture as she toyed with the cuff of her sleeve.</p><p>"Is there... another parent in his life?" Agatha's face fell, the muscles in her jaw jumping as the tentative question landed between them, sticking to the thickened air like glue. A beat of silence passed, Agatha's eyes hardening under Rio's scrutiny.</p><p>"No," she answered curtly, knowing it would not be enough from the look on Rio's face.</p><p>"Do you-"</p><p>"Why is it important?" the coldness in her own voice almost made her cringe. It was an instinctive reaction, born from protectiveness and deep-rooted shame that had not resurfaced in years, not since the last time someone had asked about Nicky's origin.</p><p>The shame that came not from her son's existence but from the desperate attempt at pretending to be someone she was not ten years ago.</p><p>From a night of mediocre sex with an even more mediocre man whom she had found to heal a wound left by her mother's disappointment - a wound that turned into an ugly scar on her soul and an endearing, small human at her home.</p><p>"I'm not asking to attack you," Rio said, leaning her hip against the island with her fingers still pulling at the shirt's cuff. "But, considering our situation, if you still have an ex in your life, I should probably know about them."</p><p>"There's no ex," Agatha growled, desperate for the exchange to be over. "Or other parent. It's always been just the two of us."</p><p>Rio's curiosity almost burned her, the inquisitive glint in her eye resembling the laser of a sniper rifle aimed at her heart, but she did not yield to the silent question.</p><p>That part of her life was locked out, the key thrown away years ago. Agatha would not search for it to appease anyone, especially not Rio, who seemed so comfortable in her own skin and would surely not understand her actions.</p><p>"Okay," Agatha raised her eyebrows. She expected Rio to fight; to press about the subject the same way Agatha had pressed about her parents to the point of discomfort. The woman's quick surrender felt almost patronizing - like a parent letting their child off the hook to spare themselves the headache of a tantrum. "So, I met Wanda. Any other close friends?"</p><p>The change of topic was far from subtle - a giant leap rather than a smooth transition - but Agatha accepted it, the tension in her shoulders lessening. If Rio had to ask about her life, her friends were the safest subject.</p><p>"Lilia; she took me under her very colorful and annoying wing after I graduated law school, and Jen; the pain in the ass who abandoned me at the bar the night I met you," Rio laughed at the words, making her relax even further. "I've known them shorter than Wanda, though."</p><p>"Have you told them about the clause?" Agatha shook her head.</p><p>"I considered it, Lilia especially. She's been a lawyer for years, and I entertained the idea of her seeing something in the will that I couldn't."</p><p>"What changed your mind?"</p><p>"The realization that I'm just as good as her, of course," Rio laughed again, her shoulder jumping with the sound. "The fewer people know, the better. With my mother, even the walls have ears sometimes."</p><p>"That's why you asked me not to tell my friends?" the woman asked, her voice serious despite the lingering notes of amusement. "They won't tell anyone."</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the counter, hearing the tell-tale signs of Nicky stomping down the hall. "I haven't made a decision yet. We'll cross that bridge when we get there."</p><p>Just as she got the words out, her son barged into the kitchen again, an impatient frown marring his face.</p><p>"Can we play now?"</p><hr/><p>Prying Nicky away from the console – and Rio – took nothing short of Herculean effort. In the end, he only begrudgingly agreed to do this homework after a firm reminder that he had been asked to finish it <em>before</em> their guest arrived but had chosen not to.</p><p>Agatha was partly grateful for the excuse to send him off. The easy rapport he had built with Rio in just a few hours felt like a cruel joke at her expense. The woman had gushed over his Minecraft house, discussing the details with an eager glint in her eye, effortlessly matching Nicky’s energy. Every nod, every smile, every enthusiastic remark sent Agatha sinking deeper into her chair, the bitter taste of defeat blooming on her tongue.</p><p>She could already predict Nicky’s reaction when he found out Rio was moving in - pure excitement. No hesitation. No concern.</p><p>Nothing that might make Agatha reconsider.</p><p>And just like that, her last valid reason to pull the plug on the deal crumbled before her eyes.</p><p>"I take it back," she said after Nicky had left, making Rio raise her brow. "Nobody can pretend to be that interested in this game. How fascinating can a world of squares be?"</p><p>"I'm going to assume that's a rhetorical question," the younger woman rolled her eyes before smiling wolfishly. "Unless you want me to explain in detail why-"</p><p>"No, thank you," Agatha shuddered, both from the offer and the mischievous look. "That was enough video games for one evening."</p><p>Rio laughed, leaning further into the couch. "Fair enough," she glanced at her phone before tossing it to the side, the unbothered gesture creasing Agatha’s forehead. The woman already acted like she belonged in her house. "Is it finally my turn to ask the questions?"</p><p>"I figured you got everything out of your new best friend," Agatha huffed, her voice bitter despite her best efforts to hide it. Rio tilted her head to the side, a teasing smirk stretching her lips.</p><p>"Do I hear defeat?"</p><p>"Don’t get cocky," Agatha shot back, crossing her arms. "Nothing’s decided yet."</p><p>"Of course," the silence stretched as Rio studied her. "If you need more meetings to ease your mind about letting me into your life, we can do that."</p><p>"Now, who's sounding eager?" Agatha joked, hoping to ease the tension Rio's sincere offer injected into her muscles. When the bartender's expression did not falter, she sighed in defeat. "I don't think it will be necessary. I'll talk to Nicky tonight and let you know how it goes. If he's on board, I'll draft the contract."</p><p>"The contract?"</p><p>"A prenup to make sure you don't rob me blind in the divorce," Rio rolled her eyes. "You'll still get your share, don't worry."</p><p>"Shouldn't I get a say in how much that will be?"</p><p>The question was valid; they should <em>both</em> craft the contract to ensure satisfaction for everyone involved, but Agatha could not fit another meeting into her tight schedule - not one without Nicky, and he could not be a part of the scheme.</p><p>"I'll send it to you before we sign," she decided. "Once we're both on the same page, we'll work out the rest of the arrangement."</p><p>She already had a plan - or rather a list of conditions for Rio to accept - but discussing them before talking to Nicky was pointless.</p><p>"The rest of our arrangement means the obnoxiously big wedding with delicious food and overpriced alcohol, right?" Agatha's eyes narrowed, sensing the playful nature of the question.</p><p>"Yes, with friends and family to see me walk down the aisle," she deadpanned. Apparently, joking about the absurd situation was all she had left.</p><p>"Why would you be the one walking down the aisle? Shouldn't we draw straws or something?"</p><p>"Nobody's walking down the aisle," Agatha hissed. "We'll sign a piece of paper, and that will be it."</p><p>"And they say romance is dead," Rio chuckled, making the lawyer clench her jaw.</p><p>The word <em>romance </em>ricocheted across her mind like a stray bullet, tearing it to shreds.</p><p>There was nothing romantic about the marriage, its very core being a legal document putting an obligation on Agatha, and she did not care. She had never dreamed about her wedding. Imagining a white dress, teary guests, and an adoring partner waiting for her at the altar as everyone swooned over her appearance felt too unrealistic, stupid, even.</p><p>Or at least, so Agatha thought.</p><p>Now, with her mother forcing her hand, deciding on one of the most intimate issues for her, Agatha acknowledged a part of herself she had not heard from in years - the part that wanted to be loved and love back.</p><p>The part crying quietly at the back of her mind, realizing her first relationship in years would be a stack of lies and legal documents - a decision made for money and not love. Was that her mother's reason for putting the clause in the will? To show Agatha that she could not be loved by anyone, starting with the person who had birthed her and ending with a potential romantic partner?</p><p>To Agatha's horror, she felt tears well in her eyes at the idea.</p><p>Was she truly unlovable? Did she not deserve romance?</p><p>"Are you-" Rio's concerned voice washed over her like a tidal wave, effectively pushing the ridiculous thoughts out of her head.</p><p>Jesus, she almost cried in front of Rio because of a stupid joke. She had to get a grip.</p><p>"If it's romance you're after, then this deal won't work," she said coldly, forcing her expression into an unbothered mask. Rio frowned at the abrupt change, but Agatha did not let her speak. "This will be a business arrangement, nothing more and nothing less. If you're not comfortable with that, I suggest you tell me now. Before I talk to Nicky."</p><p>The younger woman blinked, taken aback by the formality in Agatha's tone - the same tone she reserved for her most challenging clients, each word laced with professionalism and authority, leaving no room for debate. It always worked, giving even the most self-absorbed men the feeling that they were speaking to their equal and not a random person they could bend to their will.</p><p>Then again, Rio was not a self-absorbed man.</p><p>"You don't have to go all lawyer on me," she laughed, seemingly unfazed by Agatha's desperate grab for control. "If I wanted romance, I certainly wouldn't pick this. I know this is a business deal. I was just messing with you."</p><p>Agatha stared at her in shock. She had once made a grown man cry with that tone. Why was Rio laughing?</p><p>She swallowed thickly to ease the tightness gripping her throat. "Good. I think you should go, it’s getting late," Agatha pointed to the door, getting up from her seat. She needed the woman out of the house, out of her <em>life</em>, and although the latter was unlikely,  she could at least control the present.</p><p>Rio frowned, slowly rising to her feet. Agatha could see the urge to argue in her eyes - a fleeting spark of curiosity fueled by her behavior - but then, the woman relented, nodding slowly. "Alright. You cool with me saying bye to Nicky?"</p><p>Agatha bit back a refusal, aware her son would not take Rio’s sudden disappearance kindly. "Knock yourself out."</p><p>"Great!" she watched Rio walk out of the room, confident and relaxed as if she had already moved into the house. Unbothered by the peculiar situation.</p><hr/><p>Rio had, mercifully, left without further jokes or comments, offering only a quiet 'let me know how it goes, te veo' before stepping out of the house. Agatha turned on her heel right after bolting the door, refusing to watch the woman go like the heroine of a shitty romantic comedy.</p><p>If anything, her life was a tragedy, the Greek kind where most people ended up either dead or unhappy after fate laughed in their faces a little too hard. <em>Romance</em> was not a part of it.</p><p>Besides, after the spiral she had experienced upon hearing the word fall from Rio's lips, Agatha decided not to give it any more thought. Sure, the situation was far from ideal, and she was turning forty in less than a month with only a handful of relationships that lasted longer than three months under her belt, which did not speak to her future possibilities. Still, she had never craved romance and would not start because of Rio's unfunny joke. Or her mother's vindictive nature prone to pointing out Agatha's worst qualities.</p><p>Yes, her life was indeed a tragedy. Hopefully, Evanora would be the one dead at its end.</p><p>Shaking off the damning train of thoughts, Agatha went to check on Nicky, who resumed his homework after a brief intermission to say goodbye to Rio and demand she visited again - demand, not ask because he was Agatha's son and always went after what he wanted.</p><p>At the moment, apparently, he wanted to be Rio's friend.</p><p>"When will Ms. Rio come for dinner again?" Agatha sat in the chair opposite him, freeing her hair from the bun and running her hands through the loose strands.</p><p>"Am I not a good enough company anymore?" she teased with a sigh as the pressure on her scalp lessened. Keeping her hair up had been a conscious decision, a calculated choice to appear professional even in her home. Although the apron had partially shown Rio the softer side of her life - the single mother side - Agatha drew confidence from the tight updo, the constant pull reminding her that the younger woman's visit had been, at its core, a business meeting.</p><p>"Mama," Nicky groaned lightheartedly, rolling his eyes.</p><p>"I know, I know, you love me," Agatha cooed before biting the inside of her cheek, her playfulness faltering. "What do you think about Rio?"</p><p>"She's cool," the boy said immediately, shutting his notebook with a decisive slam. "Did you know she likes plants? She told me she's trying to make them live longer. Like when bananas turn black because I forget about them, and then they're too mushy to eat? Ms. Rio says she's working on stopping that!"</p><p>"That does sound pretty cool," Agatha hummed, the words feeling poisonous on her tongue.</p><p>"<em>Super</em> cool! She taught me about <em>preservatives</em>," Nicky said the word slowly, sounding out every syllable. "They're what keeps the bananas from turning black for a while, but Ms. Rio said most people use the kind that makes the planet upset."</p><p>"Synthetic preservatives," she supplied gently. "Ms. Rio's right. Some of them are bad for the environment."</p><p>Nicky nodded enthusiastically. "She's <em>really </em>smart. And she likes Minecraft! How cool is that?"</p><p>"Very cool," Agatha studied her son's face, the answer to her unasked question written in the soft features. Nicky had taken to Rio, and Agatha feared his admiration for the woman would prevent him from grasping the gravity of the situation.</p><p>She considered waiting a day or two, enough for the novelty to wear off and Nicky's emotions to settle. It would not make much difference, leaving her plenty of time to draft the contract and take care of all the legal matters before her fortieth birthday, but she doubted it would change anything. All she could do was explain the issue as plainly as possible, emphasizing how it would impact their lives.</p><p>"Listen, Nicky," Agatha started slowly, watching a wrinkle form between the boy's brows - a sign that he sensed something was off. "I'm asking what you think about Rio because there's something we have to talk about."</p><p>"Did I do something wrong?" she smiled at the question, gently shaking her head.</p><p>"No, baby, you were perfect," Nicky nodded, his eyes focused on hers. "Remember when your friend Jenna talked about her parents' friend who lived at their house for a while?"</p><p>"Yeah, Jenna said the lady cried a lot," anyone would after being cheated on and then kicked to the curb by an excuse of a man, but Agatha refrained from voicing her opinion.</p><p>"See, sometimes our friends need our help like the lady needed Jenna's parents'," he tilted his head to the side, scrunching his nose. Agatha could almost see the wheels in his head turning as he tried to connect the dots.</p><p>"Does Ms. Rio need our help?" he asked after a moment, his voice laced with concern, and Agatha’s heart swelled with pride. From all her son's traits, his kindness always touched her, his tiny body seemingly a bottomless well of empathy.</p><p>"She asked me if she could move into the guest room," Agatha said slowly, going with the version Rio had proposed - a friend needing a place to stay. Nicky's eyes brightened, his mouth already opening to express the emotions written all over his face, but Agatha raised her hand. "I know you're excited, but this is a big decision, and that's why I'm asking you, okay? It's not just dinner or a few nights; Rio would live with us. That means sharing our space with her."</p><p>The excitement in her son's expression faltered, his face growing cautious. "But... she'll stay in the guest room, not <em>my</em> room, right?"</p><p>"Yes, but she'll be around the house."</p><p>"Will she use my stuff?" Agatha suppressed a smile, glad that Nicky did not jump head-first into agreeing but considered the implications and voiced potential issues.</p><p>"Not unless you give her permission," she assured him. The boy nodded, his gaze sliding to the table as he mumbled another hesitant question.</p><p>"And she won't take up all your time?" Agatha almost melted at the slight tremble in his voice, immediately shaking her head.</p><p>"No, honey, she won't," if it were up to her, Rio would not take up any of her time and preferably stay out of her way the entire year, but telling Nicky that seemed extreme. "If you don't feel good about it, it's okay. Rio won't be mad if you don't agree, and neither will I."</p><p>They stayed silent for a beat as the boy weighed the options, Agatha waiting patiently for his verdict.</p><p>"No, I'm okay with it," Nicky said, confidence seeping back into his voice and replacing the vulnerability. "Ms. Rio can live with us."</p><p>The words felt like a judge's gavel hitting the table, their finality unbeknownst to Nicky but almost suffocating for Agatha. Her son's vote had been her lifeline in the situation, tethering her to the fleeting hope that she could still refuse to go through with the deal. His words cut through the string effortlessly, making Agatha fall into the abyss of uncertainty.</p><p>"Are you sure?" the question sounded desperate even to her own ears, a pathetic attempt at finding a hall pass out of the deal.</p><p>Somewhere at the back of her mind, Agatha knew her behavior was unfair. Putting the weight of the decision on Nicky’s scrawny shoulders was a way to avoid taking responsibility for the fears gnawing at her; fears she could not put her finger on, but felt slithering under her skin like parasites. Nicky was the last line of defense, all the other ones erased by Rio's apparent suitability - her uncheckered past, easy-going attitude, and willingness to participate in the scheme.</p><p>Rejecting the offer despite Nicky's approval would stem from cowardice, and Agatha knew it would haunt her for the rest of her life.</p><p>"Yeah," Nicky hummed, gathering his homework and shooting her a smile. "Can I turn the game back on now? I've finished."</p><p>"Ah, sure," Agatha muttered, the words barely registering as her mind ran a hundred miles per hour.</p><p>That was it; with Nicky's blessing, the marriage became real.</p><p>She could put the plan in motion.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Drafting the contract took Agatha two days of hunching over her laptop, glasses perched on her nose, and a concentrated crease between her eyebrows.</p><p>Well, maybe a day and a half, considering that texting Rio about Nicky's decision was followed by a few hours of staring off into space and rethinking her life choices. In those few hours, she entertained the idea of backing out of the deal, encouraged by the cheeky 'Can I call you wifey, now?' with a string of incomprehensible emojis that Rio sent seconds after Agatha disclosed that the plan was in motion.</p><p>Still, the next day, Agatha's mind started assembling the contract like a grocery list, falling into the familiar notions of drafting a legal document until she found the time to put it on paper. The ease stemmed from treating the case as any other, removing herself from the situation, and acting like it was just another document for just another client.</p><p>Except, with her name written in bold on the contract's first page, the detached approach only worked so far, and by the time she added the last words to the document, Agatha could no longer pretend it was a case like any other.</p><p>The contract was <em>hers; </em>it would change <em>her</em> life and bring a stranger into <em>her </em>home. <em>She</em> was the one getting married, and the sinking feeling in her stomach made her nauseous.</p><p>Once she had finished the draft - a rather standard prenup not to raise suspicion in case her mother somehow got a hold of it - she hit send hard enough for her laptop to shake on the table, deciding not to think about it until Rio gave her the green light to sign. With Nicky asleep, she nursed a single glass of wine for an hour without checking her phone for an answer before retiring to bed at midnight and letting sleep claim her after two hours of tossing and turning.</p><p>When she woke up, the notification rested right under the time, Rio's name standing out like a stain on a white sheet. With her mind barely awake, Agatha skimmed through the message, rolling her eyes at the informal language and the typos. Were younger people too cool for autocorrect?</p><p>To her annoyance, attached to the email was the contract she had sent the night before; the only difference was a handful of comments added to the PDF in green highlight.</p><p>Green, because apparently, Rio was one of those people who made their favorite color their entire personality.</p><p>The fact that Rio, a PhD student specializing in <em>biology</em>, tried to make amends to her contract felt like a middle finger pointed toward all the years Agatha had spent bending over backward to become a lawyer. There were no mistakes in the document - Agatha did not make partner at thirty-five by preparing faulty prenups - and the comments would be a waste of her already limited time.</p><p>Still, she focused on the PDF, clenching her teeth almost hard enough to crack as she lustrated the annotations, the frown on her face deepening with every word she read.</p><p>Her eyes zeroed in on one particular note regarding Rio's compensation in case of divorce. The highlighted sum stood out against the white page, and Agatha clicked on it to view the comment, sitting up straighter at the wording.</p><p>
<em>Come on, wifey, You can do better than that.</em>
</p><p>She momentarily regretted asking Rio to keep their written communication unassuming as if they were two regular people discussing the details of their marriage. It was a necessary precaution, considering her mother's capabilities, but she could imagine Rio's satisfied smirk as she wrote the words.</p><p>At least the spelling was better than in the email. Still, Agatha muttered a curse, staring at the requested sum in disbelief - a million dollars. The amount she proposed was reasonable; she had calculated it based on Rio's student loans, giving her enough to pay off everything she owed. Sure, it was a drop in the bucket, considering the volume of her inheritance, and it would suffice <em>only</em> to pay off the debt, but that was the <em>deal</em>.</p><p>She clicked furiously on the comment, adding a simple <em>no</em> before saving it.</p><p>Noticing that the rest of the annotations were just playful remarks - she frowned at the one about her middle name, which Rio called <em>pretty</em>, and another on the clause about keeping other assets unchanged in case of divorce, where Rio had cheekily written, ‘Bold of you to assume I have anything to my name other than my dashing looks’ - Agatha sent the response without bothering to add anything else.</p><hr/><p>Her phone lit up with a new notification around midday, making her wonder if Rio had lied about being busy most of the time. Despite her best judgment, Agatha abandoned her work and opened the email, seething at the sentence added above Rio's old message.</p><p>
<em>Our relationship is worth more than that.</em>
</p><p>And an emoticon of a kissy face because, of course, Rio could not be professional. Agatha swiped her eyes over the only <em>appropriate</em> comment and scowled when she noticed it remained unchanged. She hit respond with a sharp click of her nail against the glass.</p><p>
<em>Why did I agree to marry you again?</em>
</p><hr/><p>The back-and-forth lasted until evening, with messages arriving in intervals whenever either of them found the time to respond. Agatha groaned, scowled, and sighed with every new notification, annoyed by the unnecessary haggling. They were not in a Turkish bazaar - as she had pointed out in one of the emails - but Rio kept pushing, unfazed by Agatha's sharp responses that bordered on threats.</p><p>Another email came just as she finished cleaning the kitchen after dinner. The notification's sound mixed with the turning of a key in the lock, cheerful bickering announcing Wanda and the twins.</p><p>Agatha growled at the poor timing, cursing herself for forgetting the impromptu playdate Nicky had talked her into as she shoved her phone into her back pocket. Wanda greeted her with a broad smile - <em>suspiciously</em> so - and an overzealous nod.</p><p>"Hello to you too," the redhead laughed at her wary scowl as the twins shot past her, each throwing a quick 'hi' over their shoulder as they ran toward Nicky's room. Before she could press the woman for information, Wanda spoke in an eerily casual tone. "I heard something interesting today."</p><p>"Oh, did you?" Agatha rolled her eyes, leading her best friend to the kitchen to prepare something to drink. She hesitated between pouring them a glass of wine - or whiskey, considering the day she had - but eventually settled on tea. Wanda would undoubtedly question her about her need for a drink at five in the afternoon, and it looked like the redhead was already out to get her.</p><p>"Yes, something about your <em>friend</em> Rio moving in," Agatha froze, her hands stilling over the mugs. "You're going through with the deal?"</p><p>The mixture of emotions lacing Wanda's voice - disbelief, amusement, and hurt, to name a few - felt like a powder keg, ready to explode with the tiniest spark.</p><p>"Who told you that?" a stupid question, considering they both knew the answer, but Agatha grasped at the straws, wanting to buy herself some time before the unavoidable interrogation.</p><p>"The twins. Nicky talked about it at school," Wanda crossed her arms over her chest. "Why didn't you tell me you were getting married?"</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, forcefully chucking the teabags into the steaming mugs. "It's not like I need a maid of honor or something. I don't tell you about every case I work on."</p><p>"Agatha," the redhead sighed, exasperated. "This isn't another case you work on. We're talking about your life here."</p><p>"Oh, I'm well aware of that," Agatha grabbed the tea and nodded toward the living room. "I'm not having this conversation standing. It won't be a short one."</p><p>Wanda obliged, following her through the house. Ideally, Agatha would not talk about it any more than she already had, especially not with Nicky in the house, but she doubted Wanda would let her off the hook. At least she could take the interrogation as far from her son's room as possible, bringing the boys' chances of overhearing it to zero.</p><p>"Talk," the redhead ordered the second they settled in the living room - Agatha on her favorite chair and Wanda on the couch, lustrating her carefully.</p><p>"I mean, I haven't finalized anything yet," Agatha said, remembering the unanswered email in her mailbox. <em>Fucking Rio and her fucking demands.</em></p><p>"But you told Nicky Rio was moving in," Wanda shifted in her seat, drumming her fingers against her mug. "How did you go from lying to me about seeing her to accepting the deal?"</p><p>"You're still hung up on that?"</p><p>"<em>Agatha</em>," she rolled her eyes at the scolding tone; Wanda spent too much time berating children. "You told me the date was, and I quote, <em>meh.</em>"</p><p>"It <em>was</em> meh," Agatha insisted, not feeling remotely guilty about lying to her friend's face. She would sooner burn at a stake than admit that, in some aspects, her date with Rio was one of the best she had had in a long time. "In terms of dates. But, thankfully, it was a business meeting."</p><p>Wanda stared at her dubiously. "Okay. Then how was <em>the business meeting?"</em></p><p>"I decided to consider the offer, which meant doing a deep dive into Rio's life," she noticed her friend open her mouth, her face twisted in disbelief. "With her <em>permission</em>, stand down. Anyway, I didn't find anything troubling, so I introduced her to Nicky and asked for his input."</p><p>"Wait, you told him about the deal?" Wanda's eyes bulged out almost comically.</p><p>"Yes, I had a conversation with him about how his grandmother is a cunt and how I'm considering getting married to secure a few million dollars," Agatha sneered. "I told him Rio was a friend who needed a place to stay. Which I'm still not sure about because she's being a little shit about the money - trying to bite off more than she can chew."</p><p>"How do you mean?"</p><p>"She's asking for a <em>million</em>," she hissed through gritted teeth, the annoyance she had carried throughout the entire day resurfacing. "Like I'm a charity! I offered enough to pay off her loans - which was <em>the point -</em> and now she's trying to negotiate like she's doing me a favor!"</p><p>Wanda bit her lower lip, glancing down at her mug before dragging her eyes back to Agatha's seething face. Her voice was gentle as if addressing a feral animal. "I mean..."</p><p>"Seriously?" Agatha leaned forward in her chair, bracing her elbows on her knees as she glared at her friend. "You're on her side?"</p><p>"I'm not on anybody's side," Wanda said quickly, making Agatha squint accusingly.</p><p>"You should be on <em>my </em>side!" she growled. "Her request is ridiculous! The amount I'm offering is still a <em>shitload</em> compared to what she could make in a year as a bartender."</p><p>"But not much for you," Wanda noticed calmly, used to Agatha's outbursts.</p><p>"Excuse me?"</p><p>"Come on, a million? I know you've had years when you made that much," Agatha knitted her eyebrows, not liking where Wanda's train of thought was going. Sure, her job was lucrative - that was half the reason behind becoming a lawyer, right next to the power the occupation offered and enraging her mother - but that did not make her a <em>charity</em> for the less fortunate. "Add the inheritance to it, and the request doesn't seem that ridiculous."</p><p>"Um, it <em>does</em>?" she stared at her friend, wondering if working with children had finally impaired Wanda's sanity. It had to happen at some point; spending too much time in a classroom full of screaming kids could not bode well for anybody's psyche. "It's a year, not her entire life. A million is too much."</p><p>"Because nobody makes a million dollars in a year?" Wanda raised her brow. "I know people who do."</p><p>"I <em>work</em> for that money," Agatha hissed, the situations not even remotely comparable in her mind. She busted her ass, stayed after hours, and dealt with annoying clients to earn her paycheck. Rio would only have to move and sign a marriage certificate.</p><p>"Not for the inheritance," she opened her mouth to argue because the marriage certainly <em>felt </em>like excruciating labor, but Wanda continued. "If you see it as work, then Rio deserves rightful pay. Don't be like the mean boss who pays their employees minimum wage."</p><p>"A rightful pay is what I proposed, not a <em>million</em>," Wanda sighed at the words, the look in her eyes foreshadowing a lengthy lecture, and Agatha groaned. "And she's <em>not</em> my employee. Don't make it weird."</p><p>"You do realize she's your only way of getting the inheritance, right?" the redhead asked. "If you don't accept her terms and she decides to walk, what will you do?"</p><p>"She won't walk," Agatha argued, the idea even more ridiculous than Rio's request. The younger woman had too much riding on the marriage to throw a tantrum and resign like a spoiled child after not getting the toy they wanted. Not to mention that negotiating was a significant part of Agatha's job; she specialized in twisting words and playing other people to agree to whatever she wanted. She would not lose to <em>Rio,</em> for god's sake.</p><p>"She might. And then you'll be down not a million but the entire inheritance," Wanda leaned back into the cushions, crossing her legs and staring at Agatha searchingly. Suddenly, the brunette felt like a patient sitting at a therapist's office. "You're a businesswoman; you should see the loss and gain here. Instead, you're letting your pride dictate your decisions; misplaced pride because you should focus on making your mother lose, not acting like a child."</p><p>"I'm not letting anything dictate my decision, and I'm <em>not</em> acting like a child," Agatha said petulantly. "I'm being cautious. Give somebody a finger and all that."</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. "What, you're afraid you'll let up on this one thing, and she'll keep asking for more? Prepare a contract, make her sign it, and she won't have a claim over more than the agreed amount. I may not be a lawyer, but I'm married to one, and that's like law 101."</p><p>"Well, thank you for the lecture, <em>professor</em>," Agatha drawled, her upper lip drawn back in a sneer. "I already have a contract, which she dared contest. Like she has any idea about law."</p><p>"Ah," Wanda nodded as if the words were the last piece to a puzzle she was building. "So it's not really about the money. It's about being the big bad lawyer who doesn't listen to anyone."</p><p>"Pardon?"</p><p>"In all the time I've known you, I never saw you so pressed about money; you spent over two thousand dollars on the twins' gifts on their last birthday."</p><p>"I'm Billy's godmother, and I didn't want Tommy to feel left out!"</p><p>"Still, you don't care about money. Not since you have enough of it to live how you want," Wanda shrugged, looking pleased with herself. "You're mad because Rio's pushing back instead of bending to your will like everybody else."</p><p>"That's absurd!" Agatha protested, throwing in a dry chuckle to ridicule her friend's idea more.</p><p>"Is it? You're <em>allergic</em> to compromise, and the people around you usually accept it, me included. But Rio <em>won't</em>, and you know it. That's what's driving you insane," to the brunette's surprise, Wanda laughed, shaking her head. "Jesus, you might have met your match. Somebody you can't scare or annoy into agreeing with you."</p><p>"I do <em>not</em> annoy people into agreeing with me," Agatha scoffed. Scare? Sure, regularly. But not <em>annoy.</em> "And Rio isn't my match. She's an asshole who doesn't know when to let up."</p><p>"Sounds like someone I know," Wanda mused, unbothered by Agatha's glare. "It doesn't matter what you think about her. If she's suitable for the deal, you should accept her terms. You have three weeks until your birthday."</p><p>"I know, I have a calendar," and the impending sense of doom which served as a handy clock looming over her head. "I can still back out."</p><p>"You can," Wanda agreed lightheartedly, sipping on her tea. "But you won't because seeing the look on Evanora's face after she realizes she lost is worth more than a million dollars."</p><p>Fucking Wanda and her fucking valid points.</p><p>"She's still an asshole," Agatha grumbled, sinking into the chair with a defeated sigh and ignoring her friend's satisfied smile.</p><p>"Whatever helps you sleep at night."</p><hr/><p>Agatha sent Rio the response after the Maximoffs had left, each typed letter feeling like a personal attack on her dignity. Here she was, one of the best lawyers in the state, letting a <em>biology student</em> win the negotiations.</p><p>It was undignified, embarrassing, <em>wrong.</em></p><p>Still, her fingers painstakingly formed the message, the keystrokes resonating across the dining room like gunshots as she tested her laptop's durability. Under normal circumstances, the email would be professional, eloquent, to mock Rio’s concerning affiliation for emojis and typos. But the circumstances were far from normal, and Agatha found herself writing an almost encrypted message, leaning into the narrative that they were two lovers bantering over their marriage and not business associates discussing a legal document.</p><p>Then, she slammed the laptop shut, the muscles in her jaw jumping as the last shreds of her pride slipped through her fingers.</p><p>With that done, she had one more thing to do before she could wallow in self-pity.</p><p>"Nicky, can you come here for a second?" a book slammed shut somewhere in the living room before she heard hesitant steps in the hallway. "You're not in trouble," she added, smiling when the steps got quicker.</p><p>Nicky walked into the room, the book tucked safely in the crook of his elbow as she pointed to the seat next to her.</p><p>"Sit, baby," he obeyed without hesitation, plopping onto the chair with a puzzled look. His legs swung slightly under the table as he studied her face. "We need to talk about Ms. Rio."</p><p>To Agatha’s surprise, his lower lip jutted out in an instant pout. "Is she not moving in anymore? I already told Tommy and Billy!"</p><p>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair. She had expected this - Nicky’s excitement over having someone new in the house was predictable. What she had not counted on was how quickly he would spread the news, forcing her to do damage control sooner than anticipated.</p><p>"She’s still moving in," Agatha reassured him, choosing her words carefully. "But we shouldn't tell everyone about it."</p><p>Nicky blinked, clearly not expecting that answer.</p><p>"Why?" the word shot out of him, his expression twisting with confusion and just a hint of dissent.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for half a second before reciting the lie she had silently rehearsed. "Because… some adults don’t really want other people to know they need help from their friends," she kept her voice light, but a flicker of doubt crossed Nicky’s face. She made a mental note to warn Rio about this explanation - knowing Nicky, the subject would come up again.</p><p>"Why?" he asked again, reminding her of the endless cycle of 'why, how, and what' that had once followed her around the house like a tiny, determined shadow. Agatha almost smiled at the memory of little Nicky, no taller than her waist, demanding to understand every piece of the world with an exhausting persistence.</p><p>"Well," she softened her tone. "Some people feel embarrassed about asking for help."</p><p>Nicky’s frown deepened, his little hands pressing flat against the table. "But Aunt Wanda says we shouldn't feel embarrassed about that."</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, watching the firm conviction on his face. "And she’s absolutely right," she agreed, tapping his nose lightly. "But not everyone understands that."</p><p>He did not look convinced, his lips pressed together in quiet defiance. She could already see another 'why' forming on his tongue, and before he could launch another round of questions, Agatha leaned forward, her voice gentle but firm. "It would mean a lot to Rio if you didn’t tell anyone else."</p><p>The defiance faltered as he chewed on his lower lip, deep in thought.</p><p>"Oh," he finally said, his voice losing its edge. Then, after a moment, his face lit up with an idea. "Maybe Aunt Wanda can tell Ms. Rio it's okay to ask for help?"</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched at the sheer sincerity in his voice. What did she do to deserve such a sweet boy?</p><p>She reached across the space between them, smoothing a hand over his messy curls. "I’ll talk to her about it," she promised with a small smile. "But for now, let’s keep this between us, okay? It'll be our little secret."</p><p>Nicky hesitated for just a second before nodding. "Okay."</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet sigh of relief, ruffling his hair properly this time, grinning when he burst into a fit of giggles and swiped at her hand.</p><p>"That's my boy," she said before leaning back with an exaggerated stretch. "Now, how about we watch something before bed? How does 'Shrek' sound?"</p><p>Nicky lit up instantly. "Yes!"</p><p>Agatha chuckled as he scrambled off the chair, already sprinting toward the couch, and mechanically glanced at her phone before following him.</p><p>A new message from Rio looked back at her mockingly.</p><p>
<em>Sounds great, wifey!</em>
</p><p>And a fucking black heart.</p><hr/><p>Two days later, Agatha found herself in a surprisingly well-maintained apartment building, climbing the stairs to the second floor with the contract weighing her purse down like a bag of rocks.</p><p>As her heels clicked against the steps, each bringing her closer to Rio's door, she considered bolting, entertaining the idea of calling the deal off, returning home, and sparsely thanking her neighbor for keeping an eye on Nicky before kicking her out to watch some brainwashing cartoon with him. The past week would become a distant memory, a fever dream she could forget along with Rio, the inheritance, and everything else that tilted her life on its usual axis.</p><p>Everything would return to normal, and eventually, she would recover from the sense of defeat stemming from backing out of the arrangement.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>Knowing her tendency to contemplate her failures, probably not.</p><p>If only she could be a spineless fool like most people in the world and accept her mother's victory with a tired smile and hunched shoulders, life would be easier.</p><p>Her fist hammered against the wooden door, her aggravation translating into the sharp knocks that resonated across the hall, undoubtedly piquing the neighbors' curiosity. Agatha was beyond the point of caring, wanting to finalize the deal and wait for the judgment day as she had begrudgingly named Rio's moving-in date in relevant peace. Or at least without seeing the younger woman.</p><p>"You'll take the door off the hinges," a muffled groan sounded from inside the apartment before the lock clicked, and Rio appeared in the doorway, her forehead creased as she gave Agatha a once-over. "You want half the block to know you're here?"</p><p>"Ashamed of me already?" she fired back, not bothering to wait for the invitation and pushing past Rio to enter the apartment. She swiftly took off her coat and scarf, hanging it on one of the overflowing hooks bolted to the wall.</p><p>"Oh, please, do come in," the woman grumbled, shutting the door behind her. "You're thirty minutes early."</p><p>"I got off work sooner than expected," Agatha said absentmindedly, the sharpness of her tongue partially disarmed by the overwhelming amount of plants littering the cramped space. Pots of varying sizes cluttered the floor, windowsills, and every other flat surface, drowning the apartment in greenery as Rio led her to the kitchen and motioned for her to sit at a small table pushed against one of the walls. "Why bother renting an apartment if you turn it into a rainforest? Camping out in someone's backyard would be cheaper."</p><p>Rio plopped into the chair opposite hers, running a hand through her tousled hair. The gesture drew Agatha's attention to her disheveled appearance, making her realize the woman looked like she had just woken up.</p><p>"Do you know anyone with a rainforest in their backyard?" Rio asked, stifling a yawn. "I told you half of my apartment was covered in plants."</p><p>"Half, not every available inch," Agatha lustrated the worn-out t-shirt hanging off Rio's shoulder. It uncovered a part of the bartender's tattoo she had not seen before - a red blossom that looked like the focal point of the art, its vibrant petals standing out among the shades of green painting its leaves. "Do you usually greet your guests looking like you had the nap of your life?" she asked, tearing her eyes away from the tattoo and focusing on Rio's face.</p><p>"When they arrive early without a heads up, yeah," Rio stretched lazily, extending her legs under the table. Her foot accidentally brushed against Agatha’s calf - a fleeting touch, light and unintentional - but it sent a jolt up her spine, making her jump as if the contact had burned her. Her lips parted, ready to remind Rio about personal space, but before she could speak, the woman tilted her head back with a low, satisfied groan as something in her neck popped.</p><p>Agatha blinked, her indignation dissolving into stunned silence as the sound echoed in her ears. Her eyes involuntarily followed Rio's movement and the inviting stretch of her neck. She watched the taunt pull of the skin and the subtle trembling of the tendrils as Rio rolled her shoulders and felt her mouth turn dry.</p><p>"I need coffee before you bombard me with lawyer-y terms," the spell broke when Rio unhurriedly rose from her chair, not looking at Agatha's blushing face as she spoke. "Do you want anything?" she asked over her shoulder, moving around the kitchen with practiced ease.</p><p>"A glass of water," Agatha rasped, suddenly parched, and cleared her throat before continuing. "And there won't be any <em>lawyer-y</em> terms. The contracts are ready; you only have to sign."</p><p>"Feels like something we could've arranged over email," Rio noticed, setting the requested glass on the table with an arched eyebrow. "Unless you made some changes and came here to talk me into them?"</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, ignoring the way the loose t-shirt surrendered to gravity, exposing even more of Rio's skin.</p><p>"Everything is as we agreed," she said, raising the glass to her lips. The cool water slid down her throat soothingly, ridding her mouth of the uncomfortable dryness and clearing her mind. "Finalizing the paperwork shouldn't take long, but we're on a tight schedule if you haven't noticed."</p><p>"We still have three weeks," Rio pushed a button on the ancient-looking coffee machine, unbothered by the offensive, grinding sound that resembled the first spins of rusted cogs.</p><p>Agatha eyed the device distrustingly, half-expecting it to burst into flames or fall apart from the effort of producing the coffee. It shook unsteadily on the counter, hissing and groaning filling the kitchen - probably loud enough for half the building to hear - as it fought for its life. Agatha almost felt bad for the machine.</p><p>Then, with a final thud, the noise stopped, a few uncertain drops of brown liquid falling into Rio's mug - Agatha almost scoffed at the creature adorning its side, recognizing it from Nicky's game - before they turned into a steady stream.</p><p>"And a lot to discuss," she noticed after Rio joined her at the table again, stirring the coffee to help the unfathomable amount of sugar she had put in it dissolve. "Which we should do before signing anything."</p><p>"I figured you put everything in the contract. You seem like the kind of person who wants to have everything in writing," Rio clinked the spoon against the mug's edge, shaking off the droplets clinging to it, and chucked it over her shoulder toward the sink. Agatha flinched when it landed with a loud clank.</p><p>"This is a delicate matter, and I wouldn't put snooping around the contract past my mother," she said through gritted teeth. The caution stemmed from witnessing Evanora's influence throughout her entire life, noticing the power she held and the unabashed ease with which she used it. Her mother may have retired as a senator - without much choice since she had simply lost the last election - but the connections stayed, and Agatha would rather be safe than sorry. "The prenup is standard, something she cannot use against me even if she somehow gets her hands on it."</p><p>"That sounds illegal," Rio sipped on her coffee, flinching when it burned her tongue. "Shouldn't the contract be sensitive information or something?"</p><p>"I didn't come here to talk about the lengths my mother would go to prove me wrong," Agatha said sharply, knowing that entertaining Rio would undoubtedly lead to an unnecessary discussion, for which she did not have the patience. "Hopefully, she won't ever see the contract, but I'm not putting anything actively pointing to a sham marriage in it. A verbal deal is as bounding as a written one."</p><p>"I mean, it would be my word against yours in court," Rio noticed, playfully dragging out the first two words.</p><p>"Yes, and I'm one of the best lawyers in the state. I doubt you'd win," Agatha deadpanned. "We've already established that you'll move in no sooner than the day before my birthday-"</p><p>"Yeah, you should’ve seen Alice’s face when I told her she needed to find a new roommate. At least <em>she</em> doesn’t have qualms about people from Craigslist," she grimaced at the interruption, and Rio hid her smirk behind the mug.</p><p>"-but we'll finalize the marriage immediately after signing so it doesn't look too suspicious," her warning glare went unacknowledged as the younger woman spoke again.</p><p>"Won't it already look suspicious?"</p><p>"That's why I said <em>too</em> suspicious," Agatha growled, her patience wavering by the minute. "The timing doesn't leave much for imagination; anyone with half a brain can see we're getting married because of the clause, but it doesn't undermine our credibility."</p><p>"It doesn't?" Rio's genuine surprise partially lessened the irritated clench of Agatha's jaw. She nodded, drumming her fingers against the table.</p><p>"When my mother asks, we'll tell her that we've been dating for a year, and her meddling threw a wrench in our plans, accelerating the relationship's progression."</p><p>"And that won't give her grounds to deny your claim?" Rio scrunched her eyebrows. "You said she has the right to do that."</p><p>"She does, but she'd have to prove the ordeal is premeditated. If we were already dating and decided to get married quicker than expected because of her, it doesn’t give her anything to hold on to. The marriage is still plausible in light of her will," Agatha said, having spent hours thinking about the issue. "Ironically, marrying someone I knew longer would make things easier for her; my mother could use the previous friendship to undermine the sudden change in the relationship’s nature."</p><p>"But she can't do that when you marry someone you met a week before?"</p><p>"She won't <em>know</em> when we met," Rio's frown deepened, clearly not sold on the idea. "Or rather, she may suspect something, but her hunch won't be enough to win a case in court."</p><p>"What if she finds actual proof?" the younger woman countered, bracing her elbows on the table as her fingers wrapped around the mug. "You make her sound like the devil; what's stopping her from digging into our phone records? Or talking to people we know to check the timeline?"</p><p>Agatha exhaled, leveling Rio with a look that teetered between exasperation and exhaustion. "Because suspicion and proof aren't the same thing. She can dig all she wants, but unless she finds hard evidence, she has nothing."</p><p>"That's a pretty big gamble," she scoffed. "What if she does find something? We met a week ago; people on either side could easily contradict the story."</p><p>"That's exactly why it works," Agatha insisted, shaking her head. "If I married someone I'd known for years, she could argue we had a long-standing relationship and only tied the knot now for convenience. But with you? There's no history for her to twist - just a whirlwind romance."</p><p>"A whirlwind romance that just happens to align perfectly with your birthday?" Rio arched her eyebrow, her voice laced with disbelief.</p><p>"Yes," Agatha said flatly. "And that's why we control the narrative. When she asks, we'll tell her we've been dating for a year. She won't have the grounds to argue based on her knowledge - I never tell her about anything."</p><p>Rio hummed, unconvinced. "And if she checks phone records? Or asks around?"</p><p>"She won't find anything contradicting our story," Agatha bit back a remark about how <em>she</em> was the only lawyer in the room, agitated by Rio's insistence to find holes in her plan. "We kept our emails and messages vague, not pointing toward any direction. If my mother somehow gets access to them, we can easily debunk any claims by saying that's how we work - by pushing and pulling."</p><p>"Wouldn't be much of a lie," Rio chuckled, but her expression remained guarded, unconvinced. "And if she digs deep enough to figure out we haven't talked before this?"</p><p>"Texts can be fabricated," Agatha shrugged. "Besides, she doesn’t have the legal grounds to subpoena them unless she already has compelling evidence of fraud, which she won’t."</p><p>"What about people we know? The sudden marriage will look suspicious, especially when somebody starts asking questions."</p><p>Agatha recognized the subtle callback to their conversation about telling Rio's friends and nodded. "I wouldn't put it past her," she agreed. "You can tell your two closest friends, but keep it vague. Don’t disclose the amount of money you’re getting or the details. And only if you’re sure they won’t do anything to discredit us."</p><p>"I'm sure," the sharp confidence layering Rio's voice partially put Agatha's mind at ease. Dragging more people into the scheme was dangerous, but the chances of her mother approaching Rio's inner circle and fishing for information were too great to ignore. "So, to sum up, you're banking on her not finding proof?"</p><p>"I'm banking on her not finding proof that <em>holds up,</em>" Agatha corrected. "She'll suspect something but won't be able to prove anything conclusively. And unless she's willing to drag this to court based on a hunch, we win."</p><p>Rio studied her briefly before shaking her head with an amused exhale. "You're scarily good at this."</p><p>"That's why I'm the best," Agatha said without missing a beat, sipping her water.</p><p>At some point during the conversation, she eased into her chair, the familiar rhythm of debating legal loopholes and potential complications soothing her like balm on a fresh wound. The situation was undeniably strange, shoving her out of her comfort zone and forcing her to watch as her life veered in a direction she had never imagined - one where she had no control, where Evanora held all the strings.</p><p>Yet, despite the helplessness, there was something grounding about this moment. The idea of wielding her degree - the very one her mother had tried to discourage her from pursuing - as a weapon in this battle filled her with a confidence she had not felt since laying her eyes on the will. The document itself was airtight, impossible to contest against the army of lawyers at Evanora’s disposal. But that did not render Agatha powerless.</p><p>If she could not fight it, she could outmaneuver it. She could use her knowledge to anticipate potential pitfalls, to patch the cracks before they even had the chance to form.</p><p>And for the first time in over a month, that thought gave her something she had nearly forgotten.</p><p>Control.</p><p>"Not that I'm not enjoying you zoning out and grinning like a maniac - because, really, big fan of the feral look - but are we discussing anything else?" Rio's voice snapped her out of her thoughts, bringing her back to the cramped kitchen and the young woman staring at her with an amused half-smile.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, schooling her face into a professional mask as she nodded. "Yes, while we're here, we should also talk about how this is going to work. After you move in, I mean."</p><p>"Can't we just play that by the ear?" she shot Rio a glare that made the woman raise her hands in surrender. "Okay, I guess not."</p><p>"Signing the contract before working out the details would be unwise. It's better to know what we expect from this deal, not only in the material sense," Agatha tapped her index finger against the table as if to punctuate her next words. "For one, no parties at my house."</p><p>"Ah, there goes my plan to throw a rager for your birthday," Rio laughed, shaking her head. "Also, it'll be <em>our</em> house soon. Better get used to saying it if you want this thing to work, <em>wifey.</em>"</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth - she would soon have to get veneers with how often she did that around Rio - and pretended to be unaffected by the term of endearment as she leveled the younger woman with a hard look.</p><p>"Do you have an off button for the stupid remarks?" she hissed, making Rio's smile widen into a toothy grin, and there was that fucking, needlessly adorable gap that made her feel confusing things.</p><p>"I might, but nobody's ever pressed it hard enough," Agatha did not even bother to begin to try to understand the sentence, closing her eyes to regain her composure.</p><p>"I'm serious; no parties," she repeated more forcefully after refocusing on the smiling woman. "And no inviting anybody over."</p><p>"You mean like friends or..." Rio trailed off, sending her a meaningful look that supplied the rest of the unspoken sentence. Agatha ignored the unidentifiable feeling swirling in her stomach and scoffed.</p><p>"You are <em>not</em> hooking up with anyone in <em>my </em>house," the idea annoyed her, rightfully so, considering they would not live alone. She did not need Nicky stumbling upon one of the women - probably unbelievably shallow and uninteresting, not worthy of anybody's time - in the kitchen or any other common area. "Actually, no hooking up at all," she added, watching the smile fall off the woman's face.</p><p>"You can't be serious," Rio protested sharply, and Agatha rolled her eyes at her dramatics. "You expect me to stay celibate for a year?"</p><p>"We've just spent over half an hour talking about the possible ways my mother could discredit us," Agatha noticed, amused by the visceral reaction. "What do you think she'd do if she found out one of us was sleeping with random people?"</p><p>Rio blinked, speechless for the first time since they had met. Agatha watched her mouth open and close a few times, trying to form a rebuttal, and she smiled at the stunned expression, relishing the feeling of catching Rio off guard.</p><p>"Exactly, so, no sex," the younger woman's eyes snapped to her face at the word, the momentary shock evaporating from her face as her lips stretched in a dangerous smile.</p><p>"Outside of our marriage, you mean," Rio said, her voice dripping with an innuendo that made Agatha's heart stutter.</p><p>An inappropriate, absurd innuendo that had no place in a business meeting.</p><p>Agatha scowled, ignoring the swooping heat spreading across her body.</p><p>"If you cannot be professional about this, we shouldn't proceed," she growled, refusing to squirm under Rio's attentive gaze. "I thought it went without saying, but there will be no sex or intimacy of any kind; this is strictly business."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, expression unreadable. Then, with an exaggerated nod, she murmured, "It's nothing personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."</p><p>Silence stretched between them. Agatha narrowed her eyes, annoyance prickling at the edges of her patience.</p><p>And then Rio broke.</p><p>Laughter burst from her lips, loud and unrestrained, echoing around the small apartment. She doubled over, wiping at her eyes as Agatha stared, unimpressed.</p><p>"The Godfather? Really?" Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>"Couldn't help myself." Rio grinned, still chuckling. "You kinda walked into that one."</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing at her temple before grabbing her purse.</p><p>"This was a mistake," she grumbled, rising from the table. "Have a nice life paying off your loans."</p><p>She quickly turned on her heel, ready to flee the apartment, the deal, and that <em>fucking woman</em>, who seemed incapable of taking anything seriously. She had wasted <em>a week</em> on this, and the thought of it falling apart - especially after she had let herself hope - made her blood boil, but she refused to entertain Rio's immaturity for a second longer.</p><p>"Agatha, come on!" Rio got a hold of her wrist before she could make it out of the kitchen, pulling her away from the doorway with surprising strength. "I was just kidding."</p><p>Agatha whipped around, yanking her hand free. Her glare was a storm, dark and brewing. "I know! That's all you do - joke!" the words cracked through the air, sharp as a whip. "The deal is already absurd, and you're treating it like some game. Do you even understand what's at stake?" she shook her head, lips pressing into a thin, exhausted line. "I don't know why I expected a mature conversation - some actual clarity - when it's painfully obvious you can't act like an adult."</p><p>Rio stepped back, whether from the words or the cutting look on Agatha's face. At least she had the decency to look guilty, but Agatha was done tolerating her. She turned again, heading for the door, but she barely took a step before Rio moved - quick and effortless, slipping in front of her to block the doorway. Agatha clenched her jaw, a frustrated growl forming at the back of her throat.</p><p>"Move," she snapped, locking their eyes with icy precision. Rio braced her hands on the doorframe, her fingers digging into the wood as if she expected Agatha to try to use force to remove her from her path.</p><p>Which, with the anger coursing through her veins, Agatha realized was a real possibility. She could feel her palms itch at the idea of hooking her hands into Rio's loose t-shirt and yanking her away from the door when the woman stubbornly shook her head, withstanding the freezing look.</p><p>"You're only proving my point. <em>Move,</em>" Agatha repeated, her voice edged with steel as she stepped forward. Her fingers tightened into fists at her sides, nails digging into her palms, but Rio did not budge, barely paying the threatening gesture any mind.</p><p>The air in the kitchen thickened, tension crackling between them like a live wire. Inches apart, neither willing to back down, they stared at each other challengingly, waiting for the other to break.</p><p>"No," Rio said, firm and unwavering, and Agatha's breath hitched.</p><p>Not because of the word, but because she <em>felt </em>it - the warmth of Rio's breath brushing her lips, far too close for comfort.</p><p>She staggered back before she could register her movements, her heels scraping against the tiled floors with a screeching, unpleasant noise that broke through the charged silence. Rio let her hands slide off the doorframe and rest on her hips, apparently deciding that Agatha would not try to squeeze through with her in the way.</p><p>"Listen, I- it's easy to forget you don't know me that well, okay?" Rio's voice was softer now, laced with something nauseatingly sincere as she caught Agatha's eye. The brown orbs drilled into her, radiating the same impossible warmth that had lured her in at the bar - the silent promise of safety and comfort she could not understand coming from a stranger. "The jokes are just to ease the tension. I promise I'm taking this as seriously as you do."</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, unwilling to let the fight slip through her fingers. Letting go felt like surrender, and she was not ready to thaw under Rio's gaze.</p><p>"You have an interesting way of showing it," she gritted out, her voice like frost.</p><p>Rio sighed, raking a hand through her hair. "Will you sit back down if I promise to behave?" she asked, nodding to the abandoned chairs. "You said we had a lot to discuss."</p><p>"That was before I started reconsidering the deal."</p><p>Rio did not flinch. Instead, she tilted her head, studying her like she was some unsolvable puzzle. And then -"We both know you won't walk away now."</p><p>Agatha scoffed at the certainty in her voice, the sheer audacity of both the words and the tone used to deliver them. But beneath her irritation lurked something more infuriating.</p><p>
<em>Rio was right.</em>
</p><p>Backing out of the deal was no longer an option. Not when the thought of watching her mother’s defeat had already taken root in her chest, the first uncertain petals of victory blooming between her ribs.</p><p>Not with Nicky already counting on Rio’s arrival.</p><p>Not with the bitter certainty that giving in to Evanora now would brand her as both a coward and a willing puppet - something Agatha refused to become.</p><p>"No more snarky remarks," Agatha warned, fixing the younger woman with a hard stare. Rio lifted her thumb to her heart, moving it in the sign of a cross with a satisfied smirk.</p><p>The gesture alone was enough to reignite the storm in Agatha's eyes, and her mouth snapped open to let out her frustration.</p><p>"Oh, come on! You can't expect me to be an emotionless robot for a year," Rio protested, conveniently staying in the doorway in case the lawyer changed her mind and tried to bolt again. "I'm a funny person; I can't help it!"</p><p>"We have different definitions of what's funny," despite the sharpness of her words, Agatha moved back to the table, her movements rigid and almost pained.</p><p>Sitting back down felt like she lost a fight, making her face twist into a sour frown. How many hits could her pride take because of this situation?</p><p>Not many more, Agatha figured as she watched Rio slide into the chair opposite her, unbothered by her palpable aggravation.</p><p>"So, what's next on the agenda?" Rio asked after a beat of silence, bringing the abandoned mug to her lips and cringing when the cold liquid stuck unpleasantly to her teeth. She pouted, pushing the coffee away, and Agatha felt something in her chest stir at the adorable curve of her lips.</p><p>"Nothing unless you agree to what I've already said," she said, ignoring the unwanted sensation.</p><p>Rio grunted, her expression almost pained as she nodded. "Fine. No hooking up," then, barely above a whisper, she added, "This is going to be a really long fucking year."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, a part of her wondering just how often Rio indulged in casual sex. She quickly dismissed the thought, realizing it was none of her business and that she did <em>not</em> care about the woman's habits.</p><p>"You'll be fine. You can channel your energy into something else, like your research, for example," Rio only grumbled at the words. "Now, moving on to general house rules, I expect you to pay your share of the bills and clean up after yourself. I have a professional cleaner come in once a week, but I can cover the fee in full."</p><p>"Wait, pause," the woman sat up straighter in her chair, raising her hand. "You have a <em>maid?</em>" she asked, her voice laced with disbelief.</p><p>Agatha raised her brows at the shock painted across Rio's features. "She's not a <em>maid</em>. I don't have much free time, so I'd rather not spend it dusting shelves and vacuuming floors. Ana takes care of it every Friday while I'm at work and Nicky's at school."</p><p>"Jesus Christ," Rio shook her head, her forehead creased. "Do you have someone to cook for you too?"</p><p>"No," she said, tipping her head back in a silent plea for patience. "And if I did, you'd still have to make your own food."</p><p>"Okay, ouch?" Agatha could see a teasing remark form on Rio's tongue, begging to be released, and sent the woman a warning look. Rio pressed her lips into a thin line as if to physically stop the comment from escaping before shrugging. "These rules are the basics of living with someone. You don't have to tell me to keep the house clean, split the bills, and not eat your groceries. I've had roommates my entire adult life."</p><p>Agatha mirrored her gesture, tapping her finger against her half-empty glass. "I'd rather be safe than sorry. Considering your... <em>free-spirited</em> nature."</p><p>"I'm going to pretend you didn't say that like it's an insult," Rio laughed. "What else?"</p><p>"You're not to make changes to the common areas," Agatha's voice was firm, leaving no room for negotiation. "You'll have your own bathroom adjoining the room, so those are the only spaces you'll have free reign over."</p><p>Across from her, Rio pursed her lips, her eyes flicking over the plants cluttering the space. Agatha saw the thought forming a second before she spoke and shut it down immediately. "Absolutely not."</p><p>"I can't leave them here. Alice will kill them within weeks," Rio shot back, her voice colored with genuine concern. "And I haven't seen the room, but I doubt it'll house all of them."</p><p>"That sounds like a you problem."</p><p>Rio huffed, undeterred. "Come on, your house is huge. What's a few plants?"</p><p>Agatha glanced around, counting four pots in the kitchen alone. She arched a brow. "This is more than <em>a few.</em>"</p><p>"Because it's an apartment!" Rio gestured vaguely as if Agatha would not notice the apartment's claustrophobic nature without her help. "You won't even notice them around the house."</p><p>She leaned forward, eyes locked on Agatha, a silent plea shimmering in their depths. Her lower lip curved ever so slightly - not quite a pout, but dangerously close.</p><p><em>Jesus, that look is almost as lethal as Nicky's</em>, Agatha thought, watching those wide, doe-like eyes soften, warm and rich as melted chocolate.</p><p>"Please?" Rio's voice dipped lower, coaxing. "You won't have to do anything with them. Hell, I won't even <em>let </em>you, considering you're a known plant murderer."</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose, fingers tapping against the table in rapid succession. "Of all the things you could negotiate, you're choosing <em>this</em>?"</p><p>"I take my babies very seriously," Agatha almost scoffed - of course, the woman joked about everything connected to the arrangement but became as solemn as a monk when it came to <em>plants</em>. "Plants make a house cozier. It's beneficial to have some greenery around," Rio pressed, her fingers tracing the rim of a terracotta pot standing on the table between them as if proving her point through touch alone.</p><p>For a fleeting moment, Agatha thought about her backyard - a wide uninspired sprawl of grass, dotted with a few half-hearted shrubs and trees that she had paid a professional to plant and maintain. She had chosen a house with a garden for Nicky's benefit, envisioning a space where her son could run free, scrape his knees, and enjoy nature. But in the ten years she had lived there, she had never trimmed a single bush or mowed the lawn herself. The garden was just another chore; one she did not have the time or desire to attend to.</p><p>Her gaze flickered back to Rio, who sat comfortably among her collection of potted greenery, absentmindedly stroking the leaf of a plant Agatha could not name as she waited for a response. The woman had a way of making things seem alive - not just the plants but everything she touched, everything she spoke about with even a hint of fondness.</p><p>Agatha wondered, just for a moment, what Rio could do with the space if given the time and freedom.</p><p>She suspected it would be something magnificent. Something <em>alive.</em></p><p>"Fine," she huffed, acting defeated even though the idea of having greenery take up half of her house did not bother her as much as it should. "You can move in with the plants, but if I walk into my living room and it looks like a damn greenhouse, they're <em>all</em> gone."</p><p>Rio beamed, victory glowing in her eyes as she moved them back to Agatha's face. "Deal."</p><p>"Great, that covers it for now," Agatha exhaled, reaching for her purse. Negotiating with Rio proved to be more exasperating and tiring than some of the <em>actual</em> cases she handled, which spoke volumes about the woman's ability to get on her last nerve and made her want to finalize everything as quickly as possible.</p><p>She took out the binder holding the prepared contracts, throwing it on the table where it landed with a resounding smack - a full stop signaling the end of the conversation.</p><p>"Everything is as we discussed, but feel free to check," she said, not sparing Rio a glance as she rummaged through her bag, her fingers brushing past loose papers and the cool metal of a pen before finding what she was looking for.</p><p>A small box.</p><p>She hesitated, fingertips hovering over the velvet lid. She had picked it up the day before and shoved it into the farthest corner of her dresser's fist drawer as if distance could dull its significance. But it had sat there - a quiet, insistent presence - until now. A final, tangible piece of their arrangement. A way to make it real in everyone's eyes.</p><p>And strip her of the last remnants of pretending it was not real.</p><p>Two birds, one stone.</p><p>Or rather, two birds, two wedding rings.</p><p>She curled her fingers around the box, feeling its weight as she pulled it free just as Rio absentmindedly flipped through the contract's pages, her nails drumming lightly against the paper. The sound filled the quiet space between them, rhythmic and peaceful - a stark contrast to the erratic pulse hammering in Agatha's throat.</p><p>Her hand moved slowly, its steadiness almost surprising as she soundlessly placed the box between them, tapping her nail against it to draw Rio's attention.</p><p>The woman's fingers stilled their movements, her eyes flicking to the box, and then to Agatha's face in rapid succession. They jumped searchingly between the steely, blue orbs, hoping to find something to gauge her emotions - hesitation, reluctance, maybe regret.</p><p>Instead, Agatha's expression was unreadable, her posture stiff, her hands folding neatly on the table as if she were handing over just another legal document, not something that would cement their lie into something tangible.</p><p>"Rings," Agatha stated simply, her voice steady but detached.</p><p>Rio exhaled a slow breath, pushing the contract aside and reaching for the box. Her fingers grazed the velvet, lingering for a second longer than necessary before flipping it open with a soft click.</p><p>Two simple bands rested inside - elegant, understated, <em>real.</em></p><p>The sight made Agatha sick to the stomach.</p><p>"Well, would you look at that," Rio murmured, plucking one of them out and twirling it between her fingers. The gold glimmered in the soft light, contrasting against her tan skin. "Guess we're really doing this, huh?"</p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened. "We've <em>been</em> doing this. The contract is more important than the rings."</p><p>Rio hummed, distracted by the band. "You got my size right."</p><p>"I had to guess."</p><p>She looked up then, lips quirking in amusement. "Should I be concerned that you're this good at estimating a woman's ring size?"</p><p>Agatha did not dignify the comment with an answer. Instead, she reached for the remaining ring, sliding it onto her own finger in a practiced, emotionless move - as if she had not just shackled herself to a woman who made her blood boil and her pulse stutter in equal measure.</p><p>Rio watched her attentively, following the movement with curious eyes before gliding them up to establish eye contact. Then, with a certain gravity in her expression, she mirrored Agatha's gesture, pushing the ring past her second knuckle and moving her hand away, studying it with a smirk.</p><p>"Looks good," she mused. "Then again, I make everything look good."</p><p>Agatha sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose with her right hand, the left one still lying limply on the table as if the ring paralyzed it. "For the love of-"</p><p>"I know, I know," Rio grinned, holding her hands up in surrender. Agatha almost envied the ease with which she moved - unburdened by the sudden presence on her ring finger. "No jokes. Strictly business."</p><p>"Precisely," she hissed, pushing a pen across the table. "Sign."</p><p>Rio caught the item before it could tumble to the ground, studying Agatha's expression. "You look a little pale, <em>wifey.</em> Cold feet?"</p><p>"Hardly," Agatha scoffed, reaching for the contract and putting it in front of Rio. "And I'm not your wife yet. <em>Sign."</em></p><p>To her surprise, Rio listened, promptly sifting through the documents and scrawling her signature in all the relevant places. After she put the pen down, she looked back at Agatha with a satisfied smirk.</p><p>"There you go," she said, tapping her finger against Agatha's name written in an elegant swirl next to hers. "Do you feel like you signed your soul away yet?"</p><p>Agatha met her gaze head-on, unflinching. "If I did, I'd demand a better deal."</p><p>Rio laughed, low and warm, but there was something thoughtful in the way she glanced at their hands - at the rings that had turned their arrangement into something more than a stack of legal documents and empty words.</p><p>"I don’t know, this one doesn’t seem so bad," she muttered, her lips curving into a soft, genuine smile that made Agatha’s stomach flip.</p><p>Silently, she agreed.</p>

<p>The next week flew by faster than Agatha would have liked. Her days were filled with Rio - phone calls to smooth out the last details, texts to confirm times and places for their appointments, and the meetings themselves.</p><p>Each was brief, confined to stiff chairs in stuffy government offices, where the air smelled of old paper and faded disinfectant. They spent their time filling out endless forms, their conversations limited to verifying details and responding to a clerk who seemed perpetually half-interested in their existence.</p><p>Then came the officiant - an older man with thinning hair and the wistful eyes of a hopeless romantic, who blinked at them in confusion when they declined to exchange vows.</p><p>"Are you sure?" he asked, his brows furrowing, pen hovering over the final signature line.</p><p>"Yes," Agatha said curtly, and Rio echoed the same, her voice light, unbothered.</p><p>The officiant hesitated, perhaps waiting for one of them to reconsider, for their disinterested expressions to melt into something softer, more sentimental. Agatha swore she saw something in his face crack at the detached confirmations - a tiny fracture in his worldview as if their dispassionate exchange had personally offended his belief in love.</p><p>She had to clench her jaw not to snap at him to hurry up and take his righteousness somewhere other than the claustrophobic office.</p><p>After they stepped out of the building, the freezing air ridding their bodies of the overbearing heat swallowing the uncomfortable rooms, Rio let out a long, lazy sigh as she stretched.</p><p>"Well," she mused, the wind pulling at the strands of her hair and making them dance around her face. Agatha tucked the papers into her bag, fishing out her car keys. "I think a part of that guy died with our marriage."</p><p>"I'm not responsible for his sad life," she scoffed with an eye-roll. "I'll see you in two weeks."</p><p>"Don't sound too excited," Rio teased, her laughter too warm for the indifference in Agatha's voice, the cold weather, and the transactional nature of their meeting. "<em>Te veo.</em>"</p><p>Agatha turned on her heel, eager to leave this conversation, this <em>woman </em>who had an annoying habit of softening the sharp edges of their deal.</p><p>But then, as Rio lifted her hand in a lazy wave, Agatha's gaze caught on the thin glint of gold on her left ring finger - the band identical to her own, both brought to the appointment in a wordless understanding that they should wear them from now on.</p><p>Something in her stomach knotted tight, a sensation she could not quite name - one she refused to examine - and she walked away without a word; the image burned into her mind like a brand.</p><p>The remaining time slipped through her fingers, no matter how hard Agatha willed the calendar pages to stop turning. Two weeks shrunk to one, then to mere days, and suddenly, the judgment day arrived in all its glory.</p><p>Now, she stood stiffly in front of her house, her arms crossed, as the deep rumble of an engine punctuated the quiet evening air. A moving truck - the one she had reluctantly arranged - rolled up her driveway, its presence making the situation feel startlingly real in a manner paperwork - or even the rings - never had.</p><p>No more contracts. No more negotiations.</p><p>Just Rio. Here. <em>In her space.</em></p><p>Aware that the neighbors were probably watching, noisily peeking through the curtains to see the source and the reason behind the commotion, Agatha stepped down the stairs, ready to give orders and get the behemoth of the truck out of her driveway as quickly as possible. Rio had not graced her with her presence yet - despite swearing she would arrive on time - and Agatha had no intention of waiting for the woman's opinion on where everything should go. She would tell the movers to dump the things in the spare room and let Rio deal with the mess.</p><p>But then, the truck's door opened just as the driver killed the engine, and Agatha froze mid-step, watching Rio gracefully jump out of the vehicle, her feet landing on the paving stone with a soft thud.</p><p>Of course, the woman had somehow convinced the movers to let her hitch a ride.</p><p>A tall, broad-shouldered man followed her out, towering over her as she flashed him that disarming smile Agatha was already familiar with. Then, with a subtle flick of her wrist, Rio motioned toward Agatha in an almost conspirational wave as if sharing a secret only the two of them were in on.</p><p>The man's eyes darted toward her, scanning her with the kind of look people give when putting a face to a name.</p><p>"Ah," he said, voice laced with good-natured amusement. "That explains the urgency."</p><p>Agatha's frown deepened. <em>What urgency?</em></p><p>"I told you she was gorgeous." Rio's wink flew toward her like a well-aimed dart, almost making her flinch as blush spread across her cheeks, mercifully hidden by the effects of the biting cold.</p><p>"Yeah, I'd rush home to her too," the mover chuckled, the sound rough and edged - probably from years of smoking - as he adjusted the cigarette tucked behind his ear. "You sure about not letting us carry the plants? There are... a lot."</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes in mock offense. "Start with everything else. The plants need a delicate touch."</p><p>"Hey now!" the man pulled on his gloves, grinning. "I've been married for over ten years; I know everything about delicate touches!"</p><p>Agatha observed the comfortable flow of the conversation, caught off guard by its effortless ease. A part of her was relieved to learn she was not weak for falling for Rio's charms at the bar - apparently, nobody was immune to them, not even married chain smokers working for a moving company.</p><p>Apparently, Rio was just that irritatingly likable brand of person.</p><p>"Making friends?" Agatha drawled when Rio left the movers to do their job and approached her in light, bouncy steps.</p><p>The woman laughed before her voice dropped to a whisper, shuffling closer to Agatha as the men started unloading the truck. "I had to talk my way into driving with them. Playing the 'my wife will kill me' card works surprisingly well."</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched, the words hitting her like a freight train. She did not know what startled her more - the truth behind the title or the ease with which Rio had said it like it was the most natural thing in the world to refer to each other as <em>wives</em>.</p><p>"I thought you had a car," she said quickly, redirecting the conversation to a more neutral ground. "I'm not driving you to collect it."</p><p>Rio huffed, her breath escaping in a white, whirling cloud. "It's been at the shop for the past month."</p><p>"A month?" Agatha raised her brows. "Did you total it?"</p><p>"No," Rio clenched her jaw, her eyes following the movers as they methodically removed her belongings from the truck and splayed them across the driveway. "I'm waiting for the parts."</p><p>"For a 2008 Toyota Corolla?" she asked, her voice laced with doubt. "Shouldn't scrap yards be crawling with parts for that?"</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, looking uncomfortable. "Look at you, a mechanic in disguise," she muttered sarcastically. "Some things are harder to come by."</p><p>The vague, almost guarded answer made Agatha scrunch her nose, her lips parting to prod some more when one of the men - not the smoker - approached them with a heavy-looking box.</p><p>"Mrs. Harkness," he grunted out, offering a polite nod. "We're ready to start moving everything inside."</p><p>Agatha automatically opened her mouth to correct his blunder, the familiar mistake so many clients, colleagues, and other strangers made by assuming her marital status based on her age alone, but Rio's voice stopped her.</p><p>"Perfect, <em>my wife</em> will show you where to go," the woman shot her a warning look. "I'll get started on the plants. They shouldn't be out in the cold for too long."</p><p>The mover adjusted his grip on the box. "Jackson has some spare gloves for you, ma'am."</p><p>"<em>Rio</em>." Agatha rolled her eyes at the insistence in her voice, almost demanding informality. "Thanks, Robert."</p><p>With that, Rio spun on her heel, striding toward the truck in long, purposeful steps. Agatha's gaze followed her before she could stop herself.</p><p>The gold ring on the woman's finger caught a sliver of light as she reached into the vehicle, accepting the gloves, and something deep in Agatha's stomach twisted - a strange, restless knot too complicated to unfurl.</p><p>"Your wife's a real firecra-"</p><p>"Right this way," she interrupted sharply, cutting off the unwarranted comment without sparing him a glance.</p><p>Then, with a quick turn, she led him inside, snapping her gaze forward just as Rio pulled on a pair of worn-out gloves, the ring disappearing under the material.</p><p>After leading the man to the spare bedroom, Agatha retreated to the kitchen, listening to the heavy steps and sparse conversations filtering through the house as the men methodically transferred Rio's belongings from the driveway to her new room.</p><p>As she focused on wiping down the counters with short, precise strokes, she forced herself to tune out the unfamiliar sounds reminding her that her home would soon become a house to another person - a person she barely tolerated.</p><p>She stole a glance at the clock again. <em>5:40 PM.</em></p><p>A little over twenty minutes and she could leave.</p><p>She exhaled slowly, bracing herself against the counter. Counting down the minutes to the end of Nicky's practice was irrational. Rio would still be at the house after they returned, but Agatha hoped the mess of boxes and clothes would occupy the woman enough not to pester her. Then, tomorrow, she could spend most of her day waiting to go out with Wanda - an unwanted celebration of her birthday that the redhead had insisted on - and waste her evening on people who did not make her pulse stutter with sharp, uninvited emotions.</p><p>She refused to think about what she'd do after the distractions ran out.</p><p>"Kitchen looks spotless." Agatha whipped around, her eyes landing on the woman - the current bane of her existence - placing a mid-sized pot on the island with a smirk tugging at the corners of her lips.</p><p>"Already ran out of space in your room?" she fired back as Rio straightened out the plant, running a gentle finger over one of the leaves.</p><p>"Different plants have different needs," Rio explained with a fondness in her voice, that distinct softness she expressed whenever talking about her collection of greenery. "I didn't peg you for a stress cleaner."</p><p>"I'm just cleaning," Agatha scoffed, abandoning the rag on the counter. "You don't have to read into everything."</p><p>Rio lustrated her curiously, sensing the blatant lie, and Agatha glanced at the clock again.</p><p>
<em>5:49 PM.</em>
</p><p>Ah, close enough.</p><p>"I have to go," she announced, making Rio raise her brows.</p><p>"Right now?"</p><p>"Don't turn my house into a greenhouse while I'm gone," Agatha threw over her shoulder, already pulling on her coat. "And the keys are in the bowl by the door. In case you decide to make yourself scarce."</p><p>The drive to Nicky’s practice was consumed by daunting thoughts of plants overtaking every flat surface of her home and creating a jungle similar to the one she had seen at the woman's apartment. With each passing mile, the scenarios grew more unhinged - ranging from Rio using the marriage as an elaborate excuse to rob the place to setting the entire building on fire in a staged attempt to fake her own death.</p><p>She sighed in relief when Nicky emerged from the crowd of other children scrambling to find their parents, jogging to the car. Her eyes followed his movements, anxiously waiting for him to hop into the backseat and launch into his usual detailed recap of practice. Offer a brief respite from the thoughts of Rio.</p><p>He shattered that illusion the moment he got in.</p><p>"Did Ms. Rio move in already?" he asked when Agatha pulled out of the parking spot and maneuvered the car through the lot, which crawled with other parents and children.</p><p>Her grip on the steering wheel tightened, her eyes glued to the road. "She did."</p><p>"Oh," Agatha glanced at the rearview mirror, noticing his pout, and her blood ran cold.</p><p>If Nicky changed his mind now, there was little she could accomplish to undo the arrangement. Not with the marriage finalized and the contracts signed.</p><p>Not with her hopes already up.</p><p>"I wanted to help her," Nicky added before she could spiral even further, his voice laced with disappointment. "Are you sure she's done?"</p><p>Agatha's fingers loosened, color returning to her knuckles. "Probably, baby. But she didn't have to do it alone, don't worry."</p><p>"Did you help?"</p><p>"No, the men who drove her things to our house did," she explained. "They should be done by the time we get back from the store."</p><p>"The store?" Nicky perked up, leaning forward until the seatbelt locked. "Can we get popcorn for tomorrow?"</p><p>Agatha deflated, shooting him an apologetic look through the mirror. "I have that thing with Aunt Wanda tomorrow, remember? We'll have to do movie night some other time."</p><p>Especially since, for the first time in years, Agatha was not planning on ditching the celebration after one drink. With Rio tainting the space, she planned on staying out until somebody forcefully put her in a taxi or the babysitter called, whichever came first.</p><p>"Your birthday party!" the boy exclaimed, thoughts of the movie night forgotten as he buzzed in his seat. "Can I come?"</p><p>"Sorry, baby, it's adults only," Nicky huffed, crossing his arms over his chest. "But we'll celebrate with dinner on Sunday, okay? Aunt Wanda invited us over."</p><p>Nicky's eyes lit up again. "Is there gonna be cake? Who's coming?"</p><p>Agatha smiled fondly at the excitement in his voice, glad at least one of them was looking forward to the dinner. "Knowing your aunt, there's definitely going to be a cake. And it's supposed to be just us, Aunt Wanda, Uncle Vision, and the twins."</p><p>"Ms. Rio isn't coming?"</p><p>The question nearly made her rear-end the car in front of her. Agatha’s foot slammed on the brake just in time, earning her a dirty look from the other driver. Ignoring him, she turned to stare at Nicky, eyebrows raised.</p><p>"Why would Ms. Rio come?"</p><p>"She's your friend; friends come to each other's birthday parties," he said simply, his innocent logic making her expression soften. "Green."</p><p>Her attention snapped back to the road just as the driver behind them honked impatiently. She swallowed a curse and pressed the gas, steering forward. "I have other friends who won't be there. It's just a small dinner."</p><p>"What about tomorrow? Ms. Rio's an adult," he pointed out.</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. "She'll probably be too busy unpacking her stuff," or, at least, Agatha hoped she would be - preferably for the next year. Wishful thinking.</p><p>"But she'll be done by Sunday," Nicky argued confidently. "So, she can come to Aunt Wanda's."</p><p>Pulling into the parking lot, Agatha cut the engine and twisted in her seat to face him. "Listen, I know you like Ms. Rio, but we can't invite people to a dinner that's not at our house, okay? And we definitely can't expect her to drop everything and come."</p><p>Nicky's face scrunched in protest, his lower lip jutting out. "But she's your friend. Aunt Wanda wouldn't mind."</p><p>"Still," she sighed, grabbing her purse from the passenger seat and looking at Nicky's displeased frown. There was no winning this fight without a small peace offering. "It's too late to change the plans, okay? We'll invite her to <em>your</em> birthday dinner. How does that sound?"</p><p>Nicky mulled it over, eyeing her carefully. "Okay… but you have to promise."</p><p>"I promise," Agatha said, keeping her face straight despite her mind's protests. There were still a few months until Nicky's birthday, but she doubted her son would forget. He had a knack for remembering things she wished he would forget, especially desperate promises she made to diffuse situations.</p><p>Rio would have a field day with this.</p><p>Satisfied, Nicky finally unbuckled his seatbelt and reached for the door handle. "Good! ’Cause Ms. Rio would probably like cake. Everyone likes cake."</p><p>"Right," Agatha muttered, shaking her head as she climbed out of the car. She did not know if Rio liked cake, and frankly, she did not care to find out.</p><p>All she wanted was to get through the weekend of unwanted celebrations without Rio making it even more unbearable with her presence.</p><p>As if she had manifested it, Agatha did not see Rio for the rest of the evening. If not for the strategically placed splashes of greenery scattered across her house, she might have been able to convince herself that Rio was not there at all - undoubtedly sorting through her belongings, unpacking, and making herself at home behind the guest room's door.</p><p>Still, out of sight, out of mind.</p><p>After firmly instructing Nicky not to disturb Rio - a request that was met with a watery frown and a reluctant nod once she explained that the woman needed time to settle in - Agatha slipped back into her usual routine. She busied herself with the familiar motions of the evening, determined to push the reality of their new living arrangement to the farthest corners of her mind, treating Rio as just another closed door in her house, easy enough to ignore.</p><p>By the time she tucked Nicky into bed and began her nightly routine, the house had settled into an unfamiliar kind of quiet - one that felt almost too easy, too undisturbed. She expected at least some sign of Rio’s presence, but the guest room door remained shut, no footsteps echoed through the hall, and not a single misplaced item suggested she had wandered beyond the confines of her space.</p><p>The silence eventually lulled her to sleep, and when she woke the next morning, it was more of the same.</p><p>No unexpected interruptions, no out-of-place laughter, no infuriating commentary over her breakfast choices. Just the usual quiet hum of her coffee machine and the TV as Nicky watched cartoons. If not for the plants scattered around her home, she could almost convince herself that Rio had never moved in at all.</p><p>It took her an embarrassing amount of time to discover that Rio was not at the house.</p><p>In fact, Agatha realized it after the front door opened, cutting through the quiet around noon.</p><p>She tensed as if bracing for impact when Rio's steps sounded in the hall, an ominous sequence of barely audible stomps inching closer to the kitchen with every passing second. Her hands stilled over the cutting board, knife hovering over the massacred tomatoes she had used to work out her indignation. Over what, she was not sure; certainly not Rio's wordless disappearance.</p><p>"Happy birthday," the soft, genuine voice made something crawl up her spine, a warm, buzzing rush that quickly spread across her entire body. She hummed noncommittally, delivering another cut to the mush dripping off the board and staining her counters. "Let me guess, you're one of those people who don't like birthdays."</p><p>"They're as pointless as New Year's Eve," Agatha grumbled, without stopping the unnecessary attack on the tomatoes. "Wow, you're a year older. Wow, the Earth made another lap around the sun. What's to celebrate? It happens every year."</p><p>"Wow, you're a buzzkill," Rio stepped into her peripheral vision, leaning against the counter. Agatha barely noticed, too focused on the cutting board and ignoring the anger swirling in her chest at the ease with which Rio carried herself in the house - as if she had not escaped it for the entire morning.</p><p>Then, she noticed a flash of color standing out against Rio's black clothes - a small bouquet nestled gently between the woman's fingers. Her grip on the knife tightened as she registered the details, a beautiful composition of purple, white, and soft pink.</p><p>How the hell could Rio know purple was her favorite color?</p><p>Rio held the bouquet out, a teasing smirk curling her lips. "Will you throw it out if I give it to you?"</p><p>Agatha stared in stunned silence. The delicate petals, the gentle tone - it was too much. Too thoughtful. Too <em>soft</em> for their situation.</p><p>Still, as she opened her mouth to answer in the affirmative - tell Rio to toss the bouquet herself or shove it in places flowers should not go - the words did not form on her tongue. Instead, she wiped her hands on the apron wrapped around her waist and reached out for the gift, her fingers brushing against Rio's and adding to the dizzying warmth filling her chest.</p><p>"Happy birthday," the woman repeated, her voice somehow even softer than before, and Agatha swallowed thickly, overwhelmed by the onslaught of emotions trashing in her.</p><p>She searched for something to say, anything to cut through the suffocating sincerity of the moment. It felt foreign - so distinct from the usual jabs and amused remarks that colored their conversations, the easy back-and-forth that kept everything at a safe distance. This was different. This was deliberate, tender in a way that left her grasping for the familiar edge of sarcasm, something sharp enough to break the tension.</p><p>Thankfully, Rio did not seem to share her momentary muteness.</p><p>"Just so you know, if you <em>do</em> throw it out, I'll see it in the trash," she quipped, effortlessly dispersing the tension hanging in the air.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, regaining her composure despite the bouquet scorching her hand with its significance. "I'm not an idiot. I'll throw it out somewhere other than the house."</p><p>"You wound me," Rio pressed her hand against her heart, shaking her head as she grinned, her voice not portraying the hurt in the slightest. "Also, you're welcome. They're from my favorite shop."</p><p>Agatha decided to ignore the fact that Rio had a favorite flower shop, which begged the question of how often she bought bouquets for other people.</p><p>Other <em>women</em>.</p><p>"That's why you left the house in the morning?" she asked instead, pushing the thought away.</p><p>To her surprise, Rio chuckled, turning to the bags scattered across the kitchen. "I wasn't here the entire night. Besides, I had to go grocery shopping since you made it clear that I wasn't entitled to anything in your fridge. The flowers were just a slight detour."</p><p>Agatha stared at her in surprise, fingers tightening around the bouquet. "You left before we got back?"</p><p>"Yeah, I had work," Rio did not look at her as she started unloading the bags, spreading her purchases across the counter with no real direction.</p><p>Realizing the woman had no idea where anything went - and needing something, anything, to keep her hands busy - Agatha sprang into action, setting the flowers aside.</p><p>"The hours are that long?" she asked, keeping her tone light, disinterested, as she stuffed a box of cereal into one of the cabinets. "Don't bars usually have the last call around two?"</p><p>"They do," Rio shrugged, passing her another item. "I went to the apartment after we closed."</p><p>Agatha paused. The fridge door hovered open for a moment before she slammed it shut with unnecessary force, rattling the contents inside.</p><p>"What?" the question cracked through the air, sharp and demanding. "Why would you do that?"</p><p>Rio's forehead creased, a collection of squiggly lines spelling out her confusion. The unspoken accusation in Agatha's voice had hit its mark, but she clearly had no idea why.</p><p>Agatha was more than happy to help.</p><p>"We have a deal," she reminded sternly. "You can't stay at the apartment; we're supposed to live <em>together</em>."</p><p>Her irritation flared, a hot flame curling deep in her gut and setting her lungs on fire, when Rio tilted her head to the side, quirking an eyebrow at the words.</p><p>"It was one night, and you didn't even notice I wasn't here," the younger woman pointed out, her voice low, a quiet reminder they were not alone in the house. "Are you seriously mad at me for staying at my friend's place?"</p><p>The amused lilt in her tone carried an unspoken jab, one Agatha felt like a slap. "Don't try to make this sound like I'm a controlling wife keeping you from your friends. We have literal millions riding on the plausibility of this marriage."</p><p>"And me staying at my old apartment for one night undermines that?"</p><p>It didn’t. Of course, it didn’t. But Agatha would rather suffer a gruesome death than admit she was overreacting - especially when she could not even pinpoint why Rio’s absence had unsettled her so much.</p><p>"Just... don't do it too often," she said, not an admission of defeat, but a clear end of the conversation.</p><p>Rio's lips stretched in a victorious grin. "Do you want to synch up our calendars? Or maybe we can get one of those whiteboards to write down important things?"</p><p>"Yes, along with colorful markers and stickers," Agatha deadpanned. "I don't have to know what you do with your life as long as you don't jeopardize the deal."</p><p>"And here I was, thinking you were worried about me not being home for the night."</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched at the word.</p><p><em>Home</em>.</p><p>It landed too heavily, settling deep in her chest like a weight she had not agreed to carry. Not house - <em>home.</em></p><p>Said effortlessly, <em>casually,</em> like its connotation did not carry something more profound than the contracts and deals that bound them together.</p><p>
<em>Home. </em>
</p><p>It was too intimate, too personal - an unspoken promise of belonging, of familiarity, of something she had no interest in claiming. And yet, Rio had tossed it out without a second thought, as if it did not add an unwanted emotional layer to their situation, as if it did not shift something in the air between them.</p><p>As if it did not make Agatha’s pulse stutter, her breath catch, her mind scramble to dismiss it before it could settle.</p><p>She forced herself to scoff and shake her head like the comment rolled right off her. "Don't flatter yourself," her voice came out steadier than she felt, a stark contrast to the sharp thrumming of her heart. "Just don't make a habit of it."</p><p>Rio held up two fingers, the serious press of her lips contrasting with the cheerful sparks lighting up her eyes. "Scout's honor."</p><p>"Somehow, I doubt you've ever been a scout," Agatha snarked, making the younger woman wiggle her eyebrows playfully. With the groceries unpacked, she resumed her attack on the tomatoes, hoping Rio would take the hint and leave the kitchen.</p><p>Of course, she did not.</p><p>"So, we've already established you hate birthdays," one of the chairs by the kitchen island scraped against the floor as Rio pulled it back to sit down.</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth.</p><p>"Shouldn't you be busy unpacking?" she asked, not bothering to look at the woman but hearing the smile in her voice when she spoke again.</p><p>"I'll take care of it later. Do you have any plans for tonight?" Agatha narrowed her eyes at the question, suspicion rising in her chest.</p><p>"Why? Still planning that rager?"</p><p>Rio chuckled. "Yes, so if you could stay out until... let's say 5 AM, it would be great."</p><p>"I thought it was for my birthday," her muscles relaxed with the easy flow of the banter, dispersing any lingering feelings of softness and warmth Rio had brought with the flowers and using that blasted word.</p><p>"Honestly, I'd pay to see you at a rager," Rio mused. "You'd either be the wildest person there or that one buzzkill sitting in the corner and nursing a single glass of wine the entire night."</p><p>Agatha frowned, reaching for a pot to dump the massacred tomatoes in. "I'm forty. You'd have to pay a fortune to get me to a party like that."</p><p>"You're making it sound like you're eighty," the younger woman clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth. "Age is just a number. I've seen literal grandmas throw it back at the bar."</p><p>The mental image made her cringe. "Just to clarify, you're <em>not</em> throwing a rager at my house."</p><p>"<em>Our</em> house," Rio corrected her without missing a beat, making another stone settle deep in Agatha's stomach. "You'll have to work on that if this is gonna work. Also, on not flinching when people call you my wife or Mrs. Harkness."</p><p>Agatha scoffed, a sharp retort forming on her tongue, but her hands betrayed her, trembling enough to make a third of the chopped tomatoes miss the pot entirely. They splattered onto the counter in a watery mess, staining the wood a deep red. "Fu-"</p><p>"Oh, hey, buddy!" Rio's voice shot up in volume, drowning out the curse as it slipped past Agatha's lips. Instinctively, she snapped her gaze away from the ruined tomatoes, following Rio's line of sight only to find her son standing beside the woman, bright-eyed and beaming.</p><p>"Ms. Rio!" Nicky grinned, his excitement mirroring Rio's. "You're here!"</p><p>Rio laughed, holding out a fist for him to bump. The second his small hand met hers, she made a tiny explosion sound, fingers splaying dramatically. Nicky giggled, the sound bubbling up so joyfully it sent an uninvited warmth creeping through Agatha’s chest.</p><p>"You can just call me Rio, kid," the woman said easily. "After all, we're housemates."</p><p>Nicky's smile bloomed into a grin as he nodded, squeezing into the chair on Rio's right. Agatha's heart dropped to her stomach when he wobbled uncertainly, the seat too high for him, but Rio steadied him before he could fall off, gently helping him sit down.</p><p>"You have a lot of plants," Nicky observed, his eyes scanning the greenery before landing on the pot perched on the island. "They're pretty."</p><p>"Thank you." Rio smiled, motioning to the plant. "This one is called <em>Maranta leuconeura,</em> but most people call it a prayer plant."</p><p>Nicky’s face lit up at the unusual name. "Why?"</p><p>"Its leaves kinda droop down when there's no sun. Like it's praying."</p><p>"Oh," the boy looked around, picking a different plant. "What about that one?"</p><p>"It has many names, but my favorite is Devil's Ivy."</p><p>Agatha watched the conversation, encaptured. There was an ease to Rio’s explanation, an openness that felt rare. No impatience, no dismissal - just a quiet eagerness to share knowledge, to meet Nicky’s curiosity with warmth instead of irritation.</p><p>Too many adults waved him off, offering clipped answers or half-hearted nods to get him to move along. But Rio did not. She engaged, her attention fully on him as if nothing else mattered at that moment.</p><p>"Why?" Nicky asked again, his eyes wide. "Is it evil?"</p><p>Rio laughed, the sound soft and quiet, settling deep in Agatha's heart. She quickly busied herself with scooping the tomatoes into the pot and cleaning the counter. "No, but it's really resilient. It can thrive even without much sun and very little water."</p><p>"So it could grow even in hell?"</p><p>"Exactly," even without looking at the woman, Agatha could feel her amused gaze on her back. "It's a good plant for beginners."</p><p>She rolled her eyes at the jab. She should have expected Rio would not let her live down her tendency to kill plants.</p><p>"Can I get one for my room, Mama?" Agatha hefted the pot onto the stove before turning to look at her son, his warm eyes wide and pleading. "I'll take care of it, I promise!"</p><p>"Don't you think there are enough plants in the house already?" she said, gesturing to the pots within her eyesight. "We're one away from living in a jungle."</p><p>"Please?" Nicky pouted. "There aren't any in my room!"</p><p>Agatha saw Rio hesitate, eyes darting between the Devil's Ivy and the boy before they settled on Agatha in a silent question. Exhaling slowly, she nodded, giving Rio her blessing.</p><p>"You can have this one," the woman offered, already getting up to pick up the pot and put it in front of Nicky. The boy gasped, running his fingers over the heart-shaped leaves.</p><p>"Really?" he asked in awe, glancing at Rio.</p><p>"Sure. Just remember to water it a bit once a week; you can check if it needs it by putting your finger in the dirt," before Rio finished her sentence, Nicky's palm snuck under the leaves and dipped into the soil, a concentrated look on his face.</p><p>"It's wet," Rio chuckled.</p><p>"Yeah, I watered it yesterday," she moved back to help him off the chair and placed the plant in his hands. "Go ahead, put it in your room."</p><p>"Can you come help me find a place?" the woman hesitated again, glancing at Agatha uncertainly as if asking for permission. Noticing the exchanged look, Nicky hurried to add. "I cleaned my room yesterday."</p><p>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. If Nicky had no issue inviting Rio into his space, she had no reason to deny his request.</p><p>"Good. Otherwise, the plant wouldn't have anywhere to live," she joked, motioning toward the corridor. "Just wash your hands before you get dirt on every wall."</p><p>"Okay!" Nicky pushed the pot back into Rio's hands, grinning at her excitedly before bolting toward the bathroom.</p><p>"I hope you're right about this plant's resilience," Agatha said once the boy was out of earshot. "He'll forget about it in a month."</p><p>"It'll be fine," Rio waved her hand dismissively, balancing the pot in the other. "Hopefully, your maid will take over caring for it after I move out."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the offhand remark left something heavier than irritation settling in her stomach.</p><p><em>After I move out</em>.</p><p>The words felt… distant. Unfamiliar. They had not even lived together for a day, yet the thought of Rio leaving did not sit quite right. She pushed the feeling aside.</p><p>"Ana’s not my maid. She helps," Agatha grumbled, refocusing on the soup. "Speaking of, I should probably warn you - Nicky's babysitter will be here tonight."</p><p>"Ah," Rio gasped dramatically. "So you <em>do</em> have plans. The rager is <em>so </em>on."</p><p>"No ragers."</p><p>"You’re no fun," Rio teased, shifting the pot in her hands. "I have a closing shift, so I’ll probably be back around three."</p><p>Agatha's mind filed the time away as if it mattered.</p><p>As if she <em>cared</em>.</p><p>"Well, I'll definitely return by then," she said indifferently.</p><p>"And what-"</p><p>"Rio, I'm done!" Nicky's voice cut through the question, making Agatha smirk.</p><p>"Go ahead," she urged, pointing toward the stairs. "Help him find space for his new plant."</p><p>Rio chuckled, tightening her grip on the pot and heading out of the kitchen. "Have fun with whatever you have planned. And just so you know, my rager would've been a hundred times better."</p><p>"I really doubt that," she shot back, feeling her stomach tighten as Rio's laughter carried across the house, filling it with more life than any plant ever could.</p>

<p>Agatha was confident the universe hated her. She had no idea what she had done to <em>deserve it</em>, but the signals were there, glaring and undeniable. Right now, they took the shape of a crooked sign hanging above the entrance of a dingy bar - a familiar, unkempt sign tilted precariously as if waiting for the perfect moment to come crashing down on some unfortunate soul attempting to step inside.</p><p>She silently hoped it would be her.</p><p>"Absolutely not," she hissed, her boots planted firmly against the pavement as Wanda tugged at her wrist. She was not above deadweighting herself to prevent being dragged inside. "Anywhere but here."</p><p>Wanda let go abruptly, making Agatha stumble forward a step, and regarded her with open confusion. "You said you wanted something low-key."</p><p>"And this is what you settled on?" she gestured to the bar as if its existence offended her, making the redhead frown.</p><p>"Jen recommended it. Apparently, the bartenders are great," Agatha pressed her lips into a thin, disapproving line. <em>The bartenders</em>. Her hands dug deep into her pockets, a futile attempt to stop Wanda from latching onto her again. The redhead merely huffed at the childish move, tapping her foot impatiently. "Come on, it's freezing out here."</p><p>"Why are you asking Jen for bar recommendations? Her tastes are a cry for help," Agatha took a calculated step back, her eyes scanning the street for a taxi - an escape route, a divine intervention, <em>anything</em>. "I'm surprised you didn't invite her and Lilia to tag along."</p><p>"I did, but they had plans."</p><p>"Smart women," she muttered before suddenly - too fast for her to react - Wanda's fingers wrapped around her elbow and yanked.</p><p>"Honestly, when did you become so prissy about where you drink? Remember the parties we used to go to in college?"</p><p>Agatha shrieked as she stumbled forward, fighting against the hold with more effort than she cared to admit. <em>How the hell did Wanda get so strong?</em></p><p>"We're not twenty-two anymore," she gritted out, groaning when Wanda ungracefully shoved her through the entrance, the door closing behind them with a definite click.</p><p>The unmistakable scent of aged liquor and faded cigarette smoke greeted her first, followed by the soft hum of conversation and the drone of some sports commentator rambling about a football game on the mounted TV.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, already thinking about the number of washes it would take to rid her hair of the odors.</p><p>"Come on, isn't my birthday supposed to be about what I want?" she tried, making a beeline for the door.</p><p>Wanda did not budge, merely cocking a knowing brow. "You don't get to play that card after I had to <em>beg </em>you to agree to celebrate."</p><p>"Shouldn't that make it more special?" Agatha countered, grasping at straws. "Like, rare and fleeting? Something we shouldn't take for granted but also shouldn't overdo?"</p><p>Wanda looked unimpressed. "No. Go sit."</p><p>"Or-" Agatha took another subtle step toward the door. "We can go literally anywhere else. The world is our oyster and all that."</p><p>"It's a Saturday night," Wanda pointed out, arms folding. "<em>Anywhere else</em> will take ages to get a table."</p><p>Agatha shrugged, utterly unbothered by the prospect of ditching the entire evening. She had already considered canceling after Rio mentioned she had work tonight - because really, why go out at all when she could curl up on the couch without the prospect of Rio emerging from her room at any given moment?</p><p>And now, somehow, she had ended up exactly where Rio was.</p><p>"Oh well-"</p><p>"Wait. <em>Is that Rio</em>?"</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Her gaze snapped to Wanda's face, catching the way her friend looked over her shoulder, a curious little smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>No, no, <em>no.</em></p><p>Before Agatha could stop her, before she could so much as <em>blink</em>, Wanda's fingers shot into the air, waving enthusiastically as if she wanted to make a scene.</p><p>"Well, now we have to say hi," Wanda announced cheerfully, seizing her elbow again. "Don't want to be impolite."</p><p>Agatha resisted the tug. "I saw her today already. I <em>live</em> with her."</p><p>"I don't," Wanda countered, visibly pleased with herself. "And I haven't seen her since that day at the park."</p><p>"You mean," Agatha growled. "When you roped me into going on a date with her."</p><p>But Wanda was not listening, too busy pulling her forward - toward the worst possible outcome of this evening.</p><p>And, of course, they had already been noticed because of the redhead's unnecessarily theatrical wave.</p><p>Of course, Rio was watching them, leaning effortlessly against the counter, smirking like she had been waiting for this exact moment.</p><p>Agatha felt the irritation tighten around her ribs.</p><p>"Look who it is," Rio drawled as they reached the bar, resting her forearms against the counter as she leaned in slightly. "Did you get lost on your way to somewhere more... <em>refined</em>?"</p><p>Agatha scowled. "Believe me, I wish."</p><p>"That's what she gets for asking for something low-key," Wanda butted in, smiling at the bartender. "Good to see you again."</p><p>"The pleasure is all mine," Rio grinned, and Agatha's eyes jumped away from her face before she could catch a glimpse of that infuriating gap between her teeth.</p><p>Yeah, the universe hated her.</p><p>Agatha could practically hear it laughing at her, delighted as she focused on the sticky bar, avoiding Rio's attentive gaze.</p><p>A month ago, she had walked into this bar looking for a leisurely night with a friend. Then, she settled for solitude and tried to drown her sorrows in alcohol, hoping the bottom of the glass would show her a magical solution to the problem pressing against her ribs. And yet, she had spent the entire night doing the exact opposite - answering probing questions and fighting off the pull of the charming bartender and that <em>damn gap </em>between her teeth.</p><p>She remembered entertaining the idea of giving in, of almost throwing caution to the wind and relishing a distraction far more pleasurable than the alcohol.</p><p>Now, there was no <em>almost</em>. There was no choice to make, no temptation to weigh.</p><p>Now, Rio was not some fleeting moment to drown herself in. She was an obligation, an inconvenience that followed her home and settled into the cracks of her life.</p><p>And yet, somehow, she had still ended up <em>right here</em>, in the last place she wanted to be, sitting across from the one person she had tried to avoid tonight.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, resisting the urge to bang her head against the counter.</p><p>Yeah, the universe really fucking hated her.</p><p>"How about a drink for the birthday girl?" Wanda's gentle hand on her shoulder made Agatha look up and fall straight into two pools of brown, dimmed by the bar's poor lightning but still warm like a cup of chocolate on a freezing night. She clenched her jaw.</p><p>"I don't-"</p><p>"On the house," Rio interrupted smoothly, her lips stretching in a dangerous smile as she leaned closer without breaking eye contact. "For my darling wife."</p><p>Agatha almost choked on air when the whisper reached her ears, but Wanda laughed, patting her shoulder.</p><p>"See? The bartenders really <em>are </em>great."</p><p>"One whiskey on the rocks, coming right up," Rio winked at them, already reaching for the familiar bottle, and Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose.</p><p>It was going to be a long night.</p><hr/><p>"So," Agatha closed her eyes, sensing she would not like the following words in Wanda's tone. She leaned further into the worn leather of the booth they chose after she had practically dragged her friend away from the counter, adamant about not spending the entire night under Rio's scrutiny.</p><p>If they had to stay at the shitty bar, the least they could do was sit farthest from the bartender.</p><p>Once again, out of sight, out of mind.</p><p>Agatha considered making the saying her new motto.</p><p>"You're a married woman now. How do you feel?" she stared at the redhead, unimpressed. "I know it's unconventional, but you must have <em>some</em> feelings about it," Wanda pressed on, fiddling with the straw of her drink.</p><p>She did.</p><p>She felt <em>unsettled </em>by the way Rio used words like <em>home</em> and <em>wife </em>so effortlessly when Agatha stumbled over them in her head. She felt <em>frustrated </em>after learning Rio had disappeared after work, and Agatha could not understand why it bothered her so much. She felt <em>trapped </em>whenever someone looked at her hand and assumed the ring meant something it did not.</p><p>And maybe worst of all, she felt <em>confused</em> by the unexplainable warmth that made her chest constrict whenever Rio dropped the cocky, amused act, and her voice softened, pushing them toward dangerous, uncharted territory.</p><p>"I feel like you should mind your own business," she grunted, swirling her drink and ignoring Wanda's understanding gaze as if she had already found her answer. The ice rattled against the glass as she drained the last few drops of the amber liquid, letting it burn her tongue and spread a safer, <em>straightforward </em>warmth through her body. "Now, be a doll and get us another round."</p><p>She pushed the glass toward Wanda, making her roll her eyes. "I got the last two."</p><p>"It's <em>my</em> birthday," Agatha argued. "Which you forced me to celebrate. The least you can do is fetch the drinks."</p><p>Wanda sighed but obediently collected the glasses, moving to slide out of the booth. "Are you gonna get Nicky to spy for you in the house to make sure the coast is clear before you go to the kitchen, too?" she asked, not waiting for the answer as she turned on her heel and disappeared around the corner, walking toward the bar.</p><p>Agatha scoffed at the question, an unsaid retort swelling on her tongue.</p><p>Wanda had no right to act like her behavior was irrational. She <em>deserved </em>a night out without Rio tainting it. Without seeing other patrons become mesmerized by the skillful, effortless movements when Rio commanded the bar. Without risking being on the receiving end of that infuriating smirk - the one that made her feel like she was playing right into the woman's hands.</p><p>If Wanda had listened - if they had gone <em>anywhere</em> else - Agatha would have had no issue striding up to the bar and ordering whatever drink she wanted without a second thought. But here? In <em>this</em> bar?</p><p>Rio thrived in this space, making Agatha feel like a spectator in her own night out. A visitor in a world Rio owned with nothing but a cocky grin and an easy roll of her shoulders. Agatha had no interest in watching other people interact with the woman, reminding her of how she had once sat at the bar, lured in by the confidence of the stranger she ended up marrying.</p><p>"Here you go," Wanda reappeared, sliding the new drink between her tense hands before sitting back down. "Rio wasn't at the bar, by the way."</p><p>Agatha's jaw jumped, her fingers wrapping around the glass. "And why would I care?"</p><p>"Take it as a sign that you're getting the next round," the redhead sighed, sinking further into her seat. "Will you always treat this like a forbidden topic?"</p><p>"This?" Agatha quirked an eyebrow, the alcohol blurring the edges of her thoughts. Once again, the bartender took creative liberty over her drinks, pouring more liquor than the standard amount.</p><p>If not for her resolution to avoid the woman, Agatha would have gone to the bar and told her she did not need the handouts. She had enough money to buy as much alcohol as she wanted without Rio's misguided chivalry.</p><p>"Your marriage. Rio," Wanda looked at her with an expression teetering between worry and pity. "I had to find out you decided to go through with her offer from Nicky. You know you can talk to me about it, right?"</p><p>"There's nothing to talk about," Agatha said, not liking the softness in her friend's voice. "She's just a person living in my house for the year."</p><p>Wanda frowned. "And that's why you're avoiding her like the plague?"</p><p>"Well, excuse me for wanting an uncomplicated, <em>fun</em> night out with a friend without being reminded of the entire thing," she waved her hand around, growing agitated. "Which would've worked if you didn't insist on staying here."</p><p>"You're deflecting again," Wanda sighed, bracing her elbows on the table. Her green eyes shone in the dim light, the raw concern making Agatha nauseous. "Tell me what's bothering you."</p><p>Agatha could not help but scoff at the words, lifting the drink to her lips. The other bartender must have been under Rio's orders because the glass was full, almost overpoured.</p><p>"At this moment? You are," she sneered after swallowing the sip.</p><p>Well-acquainted with her tendency to become offensive whenever she felt cornered, Wanda did not falter, the concern in her eyes growing.</p><p>"Stop looking at me like that," Agatha snapped. "I don't want your pity."</p><p>"It's not pity. I'm <em>worried</em> because my best friend won't talk to me," Wanda explained gently. "Something's bothering you, and I want to help."</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, looking around the bar to distract herself from the overwhelming sincerity carved into Wanda's features. Her eyes traveled between other patrons - mostly college students and blue-collar workers chatting in small groups and nursing their beers - wondering if their month had sucked as much as hers.</p><p>She doubted it.</p><p>She doubted any of them had signed their name on a marriage certificate with someone they barely knew, sealing a deal that felt more like a gamble than a choice.</p><p>She doubted they had to rearrange their life to accommodate a stranger - someone who moved through their home with an ease that felt unearned, who spoke of it like it was already <em>theirs.</em></p><p>She doubted they had to listen to words like <em>wife</em> and <em>home</em> fall so effortlessly from that stranger's lips as if their situation was <em>normal.</em></p><p>Agatha huffed, setting the glass down with a sharp clink. "What do you want to hear, Wanda? That she's everywhere? That I thought I'd at least get a break tonight, and yet, here we are?" she gestured vaguely around the bar, exasperation seeping into every syllable.</p><p>Wanda took a slow sip of her drink. "We're literally sitting in the furthest corner. You can't even <em>see</em> her from here."</p><p>"That's not the <em>point</em>," Agatha leaned back, crossing her arms. "She's only been in my house for a day, and somehow, it already feels like she's rearranging everything."</p><p>"It's about the plants?" Wanda's lips twitched. "You're sulking because of the <em>plants</em>?"</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. The plants were the tip of the iceberg of her problems with the situation, but the emotions connected to them were the least complicated.</p><p>If she had to discuss anything with Wanda, the new splashes of green in her house were the safest bet.</p><p>"You haven't seen how many she brought," she said with disdain. "I swear, I turned around this morning, and there was a new one. I think they're multiplying."</p><p>"It can't be that bad," Wanda laughed, shaking her head. "Besides, plants make a house cozier. Fill it with life."</p><p>The memory of Rio's laughter carrying through her house resurfaced in Agatha's hazed mind, a velvety, genuine sound filling her ears like a flood. She pursed her lips, fighting the waves threatening to swallow her whole.</p><p>"My house was already full of life - Nicky makes sure of that. I don't need her and her damn plants taking over."</p><p>Wanda hummed in meek agreement. "And how is he adapting to the new living arrangement?"</p><p>"He's over the moon," Agatha bit out, irritation threading through her voice. She knew she should be relieved - Nicky warming up to Rio meant one less thing to worry about. But the way he <em>gravitated</em> toward her without even trying to fight her pull? It made Agatha's skin itch.</p><p>It felt like a betrayal of sorts - like her own son sided against her, embracing Rio just to make Agatha's resistance seem even <em>more</em> ridiculous.</p><p>Apparently, <em>everyone</em> liked Rio.</p><p>And while Agatha would not go so far as to call <em>all</em> of them idiots - she did have to consider Nicky in that equation - she knew better than a ten-year-old.</p><p>Rio was not <em>likable. </em></p><p>"She's obnoxious," Agatha continued without voicing her train of thought. "She waltzes in like she owns the place, charms my kid in <em>half a second</em>, and now, somehow, I have a fucking rainforest in my house," she scoffed. "Nicky's already been corrupted - asked for a plant for his room."</p><p>"Did you give in?" Wanda asked, amusement coloring her voice and contrasting with Agatha's growing irritation. A muscle in her jaw jumped, offering a wordless answer. "Of course you did."</p><p>"At least he didn't drag me to a flower shop or wherever the fuck you buy plants. Rio gave him one of hers," Agatha grumbled, making her friend smirk.</p><p>"You know, most people would be relieved their spouse gets along with their child."</p><p>Agatha's upper lip curled up in disgust, her forehead creasing. "Don't call her that."</p><p>"What? Your spouse? She is, at least legally," Wanda shrugged, resting her head in her hand, visibly amused by her situation.</p><p>She needed better friends.</p><p>"<em>Legally,</em> she's annoying," Agatha countered, lifting the glass to her lips. "With her stupid fucking plants and nonchalant act, making Nicky like her like they've known each other forever. Acting like all of this is <em>normal.</em>"</p><p>Wanda stayed quiet for a bit, lustrating her with a quirked eyebrow. Then, with a pointed look, she asked, "You're annoyed because she's handling this better than you, aren't you?"</p><p>Agatha huffed, taking another sip. "No."</p><p>"Maybe it's an act," Wanda said, undeterred by the sharp answer. "I mean, not many people would take your situation in stride. She has to have <em>some</em> areas where she's just as lost as you are."</p><p>"First of all," Agatha jabbed her finger in Wanda's direction, blinking when her hand wobbled in midair. She frowned at her glass - nearly empty - before forcing herself to focus. "I'm not <em>lost.</em> I'm <em>annoyed. </em>Completely different things. And second, did she look like she was acting at the bar?"</p><p>"Yes," Wanda said immediately. "She was definitely acting - to get a rise out of you. And judging by how you're too chicken to walk up there, it worked."</p><p>Agatha's jaw clenched. "I am <em>not</em> a chicken."</p><p>"Prove it," Wanda challenged, waving her hand toward the bar. Toward <em>Rio.</em></p><p>Agatha huffed, gripping her glass tighter. Without breaking eye contact, she tossed back the last of her drink and pushed herself to her feet - only for the entire room to tilt alarmingly.</p><p>She slapped a hand against the table, blinking hard. "Whoa."</p><p>"Oh yeah," Wanda sighed. "This is going great."</p><p>"I'm fine," Agatha insisted, proudly straightening her spine as if her legs were not betraying her, threatening to buckle under her weight. "I'm getting another drink."</p><p>"The hell you are," Wanda stood up - enviably quickly and effortlessly - and pressed both hands against her shoulders, guiding her back into her seat. "You're done."</p><p>"You're not-"</p><p>"You just tried to step forward and missed the floor," Wanda deadpanned. "You're <em>done</em>."</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then closed it. Finally, she scoffed, crossing her arms. "That's circumstantial."</p><p>"It would hold."</p><p>"I only had..." she trailed off, unsure how to categorize the generously poured drinks. She decided to stick with the amount of glasses. "Three drinks! That's nothing."</p><p>"Four, and we both know there was more alcohol in them than standard," Wanda corrected, reaching for her phone. "I'm gonna close our tab while you <em>stay</em> here."</p><p>Agatha melted into the worn leather, shooting her friend a glare despite the fog clouding her vision. "I'm not a dog."</p><p>"No, but you're wasted. I'd rather return your home in one piece," Wanda looked at her sternly - Agatha suspected it was one of the looks she gave misbehaving children in her class - and strode toward the bar.</p><p>Out of sheer spite, Agatha hoisted herself up again, keeping her hands firmly on the table as she willed her uncooperative legs to work. She could meet Wanda outside, where the other patrons' chatter and the hum of TV did not overwhelm her senses. Where there was no chance of seeing-</p><p>"Whoa, what are you doing, Bambi?" her concentration on steadying her feet on the traitorously unstable ground faltered, forcing her to grip the table tighter to avoid an undignified fall back into her seat.</p><p>Her eyes snapped to the woman who materialized next to her like a bad omen, gritting her teeth at the amused smile pulling at the corners of Rio's lips.</p><p>"Wanda's taking care of the tab," she grumbled, hoping to chase the bartender away.</p><p>"I know. She sent me here."</p><p>
<em>Fucking traitor.</em>
</p><p>Deciding that ignoring Rio was the best approach, Agatha twisted her torso, one hand still holding onto the table like a lifeline while she reached for her coat. She yanked once - nothing. Twice - still stuck. She growled under her breath, giving one last futile tug before stumbling forward.</p><p>"Here, let me," Rio's voice came from behind her, smooth and unbothered.</p><p>Before Agatha could protest, a hand - warm, steady, frustratingly gentle - gripped her sleeve, guiding her arm down. Then Rio was there, brushing against Agatha's back as she effortlessly freed the coat from the hanger.</p><p>Agatha stiffened, her grip tightening on the table as Rio's warmth ghosted against her back. The scent of her - something earthy, tinged with the lingering traces of liquor and wood - wrapped around her senses, making her stomach lurch in a way that had nothing to do with the alcohol.</p><p>"I had it," she muttered, though the words lacked their usual bite, her senses overwhelmed by the woman's proximity.</p><p>Rio hummed, the sound entirely too smug as she stepped back, taking the warmth and scent with her. "Sure you did."</p><p>Agatha scowled, twisting to snatch the coat from her, but the sudden movement sent a dizzy wave crashing over her. She wobbled, and before she could catch herself, Rio's free hand landed on her waist, steadying her with an ease that irritated her further.</p><p>"Easy, Bambi," Rio teased, amusement lacing her voice.</p><p>Agatha bristled, shoving at the arm holding her in place. Her fingers barely grazed the sleeve, missing their mark. "Don't call me that."</p><p>"Would you prefer lightweight?"</p><p>"This is your fault," she grumbled, feeling the muscles in her stomach jump when Rio's hand moved to her hip, leading her out of the booth. "I hate you."</p><p>Rio grinned, draping the coat over Agatha's shoulders with a frustrating amount of care before handing her her bag.</p><p>"Sure you do," she said, her voice far too fond for Agatha's liking as her hand moved again, sliding from Agatha's waist to her elbow. "Come on, let's get you home before you fall on your face."</p><p>Agatha yanked her arm out of the grip, the word coupled with Rio's proximity, making the knot in her stomach tighten. "I don't need saving. Get back to work."</p><p>"I already clocked out," Rio let her hand drop, but her eyes stayed firmly on Agatha, calculating every uncertain sway. "And you can't <em>stand</em>."</p><p>"Oh yeah? Then what am I doing now?" Agatha shot back, motioning to herself, her hands too shaky to make her point valid. "It’s barely midnight, you’re supposed to close."</p><p>"It’s slow today," Rio shrugged as if the bar behind her wasn’t bustling with people, extending her arm toward the swaying lawyer. "Let’s go."</p><p>Agatha glared at her, her vision blurring at the edges, and Rio sighed, letting the hand drop. "Okay, come on then," she stepped back, clearing Agatha's path to the exit, the challenge in her voice unmistakable.</p><p>"I'm waiting for Wanda," she hissed, the prospect of attempting to move under Rio's scrutiny unappealing. Not that she <em>couldn't, </em>but she would preferably do it without the woman looking at her like she was seconds away from ending up on the dirty floor.</p><p>"She said she'd wait outside. Something about calling her husband?" Rio shifted on her feet, adjusting the backpack slung over her shoulder. "You realize taking two Ubers doesn't make sense, right? We can share; cut down on our carbon footprint."</p><p>Agatha scoffed, crossing her arms tightly over her chest as if that would somehow steady her wobbling stance. "Wow, how noble of you. Conducting research to solve world hunger <em>and</em> saving the planet. What's next? World peace?"</p><p>Rio smirked, tilting her head. "One thing at a time, sweetheart."</p><p>The pet name made Agatha's eye twitch, but she was too focused on the fact that Wanda had <em>abandoned </em>her to argue. "I don't need your help."</p><p>"Once again, you can barely stand."</p><p>"I can stand just fine," Agatha snapped, willing herself to remain perfectly still. The effort only made her vision swim, Rio's face rapidly losing focus before sharpening again.</p><p>"Alright then, walk to the door."</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. "I don't need you watching me."</p><p>"I can turn around if you want," Rio shrugged, motioning to the exit again. "You made it clear you don't need my help, so walking to the door shouldn't be a problem, right?"</p><p>Agatha bristled at the challenge, her stubbornness flaring to life. "It's not."</p><p>She straightened her shoulders and took a calculated step forward, her eyes glued to Rio in a silent <em>I told you so</em>.</p><p>In hindsight, she should have kept them on the ground. That way, she would notice the floor tilt, throwing her off balance and sending her face-first toward the table. Before she could so much as curse, Rio's arm shot out, steadying her with a sigh.</p><p>"Alright, that's enough pride for one night," Rio pulled her closer, the tantalizing warmth seeping through Agatha's clothes as quick as water.</p><p>Agatha groaned, letting her head tip forward against Rio's shoulder - just long enough to gather herself - before she gritted out, "You're enjoying this, aren't you?"</p><p>Rio chuckled, her warm breath ghosting the side of Agatha's face. "More than I should."</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, exhaling deeply. "Fine, let's just go."</p><p>"M'lady," Rio extended her elbow, offering it to Agatha with an overzealous nod, and without much choice, Agatha let herself be led out of the bar, straight into the cold, evening air.</p><p>Wanda smiled at them the second the door closed, pocketing her phone and pointing toward a car parked by the curb. "My ride's here."</p><p>"Some friend you are," Agatha grumbled, shifting her weight but not letting go of Rio's arm - her only assurance that she would not break her tailbone in a demeaning encounter with the pavement. "Leaving me with a stranger."</p><p>Wanda chuckled, wrapping her in a quick hug. "I'm leaving you with your <em>wife</em>," she mused before turning to Rio. "Take care of her and text me when you get home."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am," satisfied with the answer, Wanda strode over to the car, disappearing inside before Agatha could form a proper retort. She sighed, her head dropping forward in defeat.</p><p>"I hate everyone," she muttered to the ground, feeling Rio shift beside her.</p><p>"Everyone?" the woman pressed, tapping on her phone. The rhythmic clicks of her nails hitting the screen filled the space.</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha lifted her head just enough to glare at her. "Especially you."</p><p>Rio's lips twitched, amusement flickering across her face as she put the phone away. "Fair. The driver will be here in five minutes."</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth, nodding stiffly as the night air wrapped around her like a sheet of ice. The sharp contrast to the bar's warmth sent another shiver down her spine, and without thinking, she leaned closer to Rio, her fingers tightening around the woman's arm.</p><p>Before she could register the shift, Rio slipped her arm free, and the sudden loss of support made Agatha stumble, her body tilting slightly. A protest formed on her tongue, fueled by alcohol and irritation, but before she could voice it, a steady arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her securely against Rio's side.</p><p>Warmth.</p><p>It spread through her like a slow burn, seeping into her skin where Rio's touch lingered, anchoring her in a way that was both infuriating and - annoyingly - comforting.</p><p>She stiffened, feeling the scorching heat bloom in every contact point, and for a moment, she simply stood there, suspended in the strange, unwanted proximity. The alcohol still clung to her bloodstream like a fog, making her head spin and scattering her thoughts.</p><p>"How's that hate going?" Rio murmured, her voice low but with a hint of amusement as if she were barely holding back a smirk.</p><p>Agatha's heart skipped, the sensation of Rio's breath hitting her ear sending a shiver down her spine. She clenched her teeth tighter. "Perfectly fine. Now, let go of me."</p><p>"Oh, I would," Rio teased, tightening her grip when Agatha pushed against her in a feeble attempt to free herself. "But I don't think one of the best lawyers in the state should end up on the pavement in front of a shitty bar."</p><p>"I wouldn't," she said petulantly. "You don't need to baby me."</p><p>Rio chuckled, the tension in her grip softening, offering Agatha a little space without letting go. "I'm not babying you," she said, her tone turning less teasing but still laced with something far too understanding for Agatha's liking. "I'm <em>helping</em>. It's okay to let someone do that every once in a while, you know? Doesn't make you any less of a badass lawyer."</p><p>A beat of silence stretched between them, thick and charged, and Agatha's breath faltered.</p><p>She could not remember the last time someone had been this close - this <em>present</em> - without asking for something in return. Her world was built on transactions, the kind where every favor had a price and every act of kindness came with an angle. Growing up the daughter of a powerful politician, she had learned early on that people rarely offered help without a hidden motive. And after building her own influence, she became the target - of admiration, of ambition, of people looking for a way in.</p><p>It made her careful. It made her wear her status like armor, keeping others at a comfortable, strategic distance. She could not remember the last time she <em>let</em> somebody be this close, the last time she felt comfortable enough to be held like that and taken care of.</p><p>The idea of letting <em>Rio,</em> of all people, be the one to push past her walls - Rio with whom her relationship was purely transactional - felt absurd, but at the same time, she could not find the strength to step away.</p><p>The realization made Agatha's head spin worse than the alcohol.</p><p>"Rio..." her voice cracked, her tongue too heavy to form whatever thought was clawing up her throat. A breath slipped past her lips - exhausted, frustrated, caught somewhere between resistance and surrender - as she grasped at the straws of control, her muddled brain unable to make sense of Rio's warmth pressed against her, of the fire it sparked in her body.</p><p>"Let's get you into the car, huh?" Rio cut through the tension, her tone softening.</p><p>Agatha did not answer at first, her lips pressed tightly together as she wrestled with the knot in her chest. With a resigned sigh, she nodded, unwilling to meet Rio's eyes for fear of what she might see in them.</p><p>Rio did not push further, taking a single step forward and guiding her toward the parked car in silence. Once they settled into the backseat, Rio turned to look out the window, her fingers tapping rhythmically against the door as the driver sped toward the house.</p><p>The space between them stretched along with the silence, and Agatha found a traitorous part of her mind yearning for the warmth, for the steadiness of Rio's touch. She clasped her hands firmly in her lap, closing her eyes to regain the composure Rio was so effortless in stealing. But the holes left in her armor by Rio's gentleness would not mend, exposing her skin in a way that felt too vulnerable, too <em>quick</em>.</p><p>Rio made her feel seen, instinctively sensing her reluctance to accept anybody's help and trying to offer her <em>some</em> control over the situation, even if Agatha could barely stand on her own. There was no pity in her voice, no indication that Agatha should feel embarrassed. She acted normal, teasing and joking in an already familiar way that - although irritating - was easier to bear than concerned glances and patronizing comments.</p><p>Somehow, after knowing her for only a month, Rio figured out the best approach to get her to accept her help.</p><p>It was terrifying.</p><p>"You asleep?" she jolted, her eyes snapping open at the amused question. Rio was leaning over the empty seat, her face inches away from Agatha's, and she yelped, her head digging into the headrest. "I'll take that as a no."</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. "Are you trying to give me a heart attack?"</p><p>"I was checking if you were still alive," Rio laughed, returning to her seat and reaching for the door handle. Before Agatha could register that they were already parked in front of the house, Rio circled the car, opening her door and sticking out her hand. "M'lady."</p><p>"I'm fine," Agatha gritted out, grabbing the door for support and hoisting herself out of the vehicle. Rio stepped back, humming when she planted her feet on the ground without swaying too much.</p><p>"Damn, there goes my chivalrous act of leading you to the door," before Agatha could comment, the woman stuck her head into the car. "Thank you," she addressed the driver, who smiled in the rearview mirror.</p><p>"You two make a beautiful couple," he said as Rio grabbed Agatha's purse, abandoned in the backseat in her quest to prove the bartender wrong. "Have a nice night."</p><p>"You too," Rio responded smoothly, unbothered by the comment that made Agatha's stomach lurch, and closed the door. "Ready?"</p><p>Agatha ignored the question. "Why would he think we're a couple?" she scoffed, snatching her purse out of Rio's hand and slinging it over her shoulder. The miscalculated force made it wrap around her back, hitting her spine. "We didn't do anything to make him think that."</p><p>"He assumed," Rio shrugged, motioning to the house. "Are we going in? Or would you rather call him back here to explain our situation?"</p><p>Wordlessly, Agatha started moving toward the door, her heels occasionally catching on the cobblestone as Rio hovered behind her, ready to step in. She barely registered it, her mind too focused on the driver's words, playing them on repeat like a broken record.</p><p>She understood the assumption; their position in front of the bar could be considered <em>romantic</em> if taken out of context. The comment did not bother her as much as Rio's reaction - the unbothered shrug, the unconcerned lilt in her voice.</p><p>Wanda's words echoed in her ears, urging her to ask the question simmering on the tip of her tongue, and she was too tired to fight it.</p><p>"Do you really not care?" the words seemed to paralyze Rio, making her freeze with one leg planted on the porch's first step while the other still rested on the pavement.</p><p>Slowly, the woman turned to look at her, confusion etched into her forehead. "About?"</p><p>"All of this," Agatha waved her hand between them. "None of it affects you?"</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, glancing around as if the suburban street might suddenly come alive at midnight. "Let's just get inside," she muttered, hands digging into her pockets in search of the house keys.</p><p>Agatha frowned at the dismissal, crossing her arms. "I asked you a question."</p><p>She gripped the handrail as she stepped up, only for it to wobble under her weight - a sharp reminder that she was supposed to call someone to fix it. Before she could react, Rio was at her side, steadying her elbow. Agatha let her, barely paying attention to the warmth of her touch as she kept her gaze locked on Rio's profile, impatiently waiting for an answer.</p><p>Rio sighed, pressing the key into the lock under her watchful stare. "You'll have to be clearer than that. What doesn't affect me? The deal?"</p><p>The door opened, and Rio beckoned her inside before closing it with a soft click.</p><p>Agatha blindly reached for the light switch, flicked it on, and immediately squinted against the too-bright glare that worsened her budding hangover.</p><p>"Obviously," she hissed, tossing her purse to the side and clawing at the coat still hanging off her shoulders. "You act like - fucking hell - you act like it doesn't bother - oh, for fuck's sake-"</p><p>The coat slipped off before she could catch it, landing in a heap at her feet, mocking her. Instinctively, she leaned down to grab it - misjudging the movement in her inebriated state and throwing herself off balance.</p><p>Once again, Rio was there, catching her before she could fall.</p><p>"Maybe we should have this conversation when you're sober," she murmured, the usual teasing lilt absent from her voice.</p><p>Agatha's mouth snapped open to argue, but the remark died in her throat, replaced by a surprised gasp when Rio fell to her knees, tapping her calf.</p><p>"Up."</p><p>Too stunned to object, Agatha obeyed, lifting her leg as Rio slid off her shoe. Her hands landed on Rio's shoulders for balance, her mind struggling to process the sight before her.</p><p>She barely registered the second shoe slipping from her foot.</p><p>Barely noticed the steady pressure of Rio's hands.</p><p>All she could focus on was the woman kneeling before her.</p><p>"You're quiet all of sudden," Rio murmured, her voice slicing through the tension as she set the shoes aside, her chin nearly brushing Agatha's thigh. "That's a first."</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, digging her fingers into the soft fabric of Rio's jacket before realizing she was still clinging to the woman, forcing her to stay down. She quickly withdrew her hands, the weight of Rio's stare pressing into her uncomfortably, brown eyes peeking at her from underneath eyelashes in a way that made her insides clench.</p><p>"You didn't have to do that," she grumbled, forcing herself to look anywhere but at Rio. "Also, you didn't answer my quest-"</p><p>The sound of slow, soft steps interrupted her. She almost groaned, remembering the babysitter. "Agatha? Is that you, dear?"</p><p>"No, it's a fucking robber," she muttered under her breath, making Rio snicker as she got up to her feet, shrugging off her jacket. Agatha opened her mouth to tell the younger woman to make herself scarce - as if Mrs. Davis would not find out she moved in at some point - when her neighbor rounded the corner, walking into the hall with a broad smile that instantly made Agatha roll her eyes.</p><p>For a widow, Mrs. Davis was an awfully cheerful person.</p><p>"Oh, you have company!" she noted, eyes flicking to Rio with blatant curiosity before extending a hand. "I'm Sharon. Nice to meet you!"</p><p>Rio's lips curled into an easy smile as she shook the woman's hand. "Rio. Nice to meet you, too. You're the babysitter?"</p><p>"And neighbor," she added, her eyes darting between them. "And you are...?"</p><p>"I'm-"</p><p>"Thank you for watching Nicky," Agatha interrupted, cutting Rio off before she could reveal anything and open the floodgates of Sharon's relentless questioning. Ever since her husband died, the woman had taken an unhealthy interest in everyone's love life - Agatha shuddered at the thought of her reaction if she found out about the marriage. "We won't keep you any longer."</p><p>Sharon's face fell slightly, but she quickly recovered. "Oh, it was no trouble at all! Honestly, the time flew. Nicky's such a sweetheart, he told me about-"</p><p>"Mrs. Hart-"</p><p>"<em>Davis</em>," Sharon corrected with a knowing smile. "And how many times do I have to tell you to call me Sharon, dear?"</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, inhaling sharply to keep her patience intact.</p><p>Sharon, oblivious, turned to Rio. "You see, Mr. Hart was my first husband, and-"</p><p>Rio's gaze bounced between them before she smoothly stepped in. "I'm sorry, <em>Sharon</em>, but Agatha's not feeling great. She should really go to bed," her tone was light but firm, leaving no room for argument.</p><p>Sharon's smile softened as she turned back to Agatha, her gaze flickering over her unsteady stance. "Oh, of course, dear! I hope you're not coming down with something. The weather's been truly awful, my joints-"</p><p>"Thank you again," Rio cut in smoothly, already reaching for the door. "We'll catch up another time, yeah? Wouldn't want her passing out on the floor."</p><p>"Right, right," Sharon nodded, throwing Agatha one last concerned glance before slipping on her coat. "Feel better, dear."</p><p>With that, Rio gently nudged the door shut behind her, locking it with a quiet click. Agatha exhaled sharply, pressing her fingers to her temples as if that would somehow ease the throbbing in her skull.</p><p>"God, she talks so much," she muttered, reaching for her bag.</p><p>Rio smirked, leaning back against the door, arms crossed. "She seems nice."</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare, not nearly drunk enough to miss the blatant attempt at deflection. "Can you stop avoiding the question?"</p><p>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, bending to grab her backpack. "Annoying when somebody else does it, huh?"</p><p>Agatha's jaw clenched. Her head throbbed, exhaustion weighed her down, and her vision swam slightly at the edges, but she refused to let this go. Not when Rio had spent the entire night proving, over and over again, just how unaffected she was.</p><p>How <em>easy</em> it was for her.</p><p>She had let the words like <em>home</em> and <em>wife</em> roll off her tongue like they meant nothing. Had humored the Uber driver's assumptions without hesitation. Had played along so naturally that it made Agatha feel <em>weak</em>.</p><p>Weak for flinching at words that should mean nothing.</p><p>Weak for letting this arrangement rattle her when Rio carried on as if nothing had changed.</p><p>Her hand seized Rio's wrist when the woman tried to walk past her, fingernails digging into soft skin. Brown eyes fell on her, infuriatingly calm, and Agatha tightened her hold, unwilling to let Rio slip away.</p><p>"Answer the question<em>,</em>" she ordered, voice low, deliberate. "Doesn't <em>any </em>of this affect you?"</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but did not attempt to free her arm, letting Agatha's grip cut off her circulation. "I married a stranger and moved to her house. What do you think?"</p><p>Agatha's lips pressed into a thin line. It was not enough. "Then why do you act like that?"</p><p>"Like what?" Rio scoffed, turning to look at her, dark eyes void of the usual amusement. "Like myself? I hate to break it to you, but I don't change my personality for a partner. Not even a <em>fake </em>wife."</p><p>The words struck Agatha like a slap, falling off Rio's lips almost like an insult - loaded and venomous. She realized it was the first time Rio had added <em>fake</em> in front of the title, an accurate distinction that, for some reason, made Agatha's heart clench.</p><p>Her mouth opened before she could register it, an explanation tumbling off her tongue in a messy heap. "That's not what I meant! Just - you seem so unbothered by all of this! Calling me your <em>wife </em>and this house your <em>home</em>. You didn't even blink at that driver's words!"</p><p>"And that upsets you?" Rio's brows pulled together, her fingers flexing in Agatha's grip. "You're angry because I try to make this work?"</p><p>"What? No!" Agatha ran her free hand over her face, the weariness and alcohol clouding her mind. "I'm not angry, I'm-"</p><p>The word was on her tongue before she even realized it.</p><p>
<em>Jealous.</em>
</p><p>It hit her like a punch in the gut.</p><p>She was jealous of how unbothered Rio acted, of how effortlessly she adapted, while Agatha felt her sanity fade with every passing minute.</p><p>She <em>envied</em> Rio's confidence in playing the new role the will had cast them in, feeling like a Z-list celebrity pushed to work with an Oscar-winning actress. Stumbling over her lines while her castmate gave the performance of her lifetime, taking the changes in the script in stride while she struggled to read them properly.</p><p>Her fingers twitched against Rio's wrist, but she did not let go. Not yet.</p><p>She needed something - an answer, an explanation, a secret formula to make this all make sense.</p><p>Because <em>none</em> of it did.</p><p>Rio was not acting as Wanda had suggested - she was not playing a part, struggling to choke down the reality of what they had been roped into. She was just... <em>here</em>. Settled in a way that made Agatha's stomach twist, as if <em>she</em> were the one out of place in her own life.</p><p>"How do you do it?" the question slipped out before she could stop it, making Rio blink.</p><p>"Do what?"</p><p>"Make this seem normal," desperation edged her voice - a silent plea for Rio to give her the answer sheet to a test she had not prepared for.</p><p>Offer a solution that would make her feel less powerless.</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, studying her as if she were considering her next words carefully.</p><p>Then, finally, she shrugged. "I don't overthink it."</p><p>Agatha's grip loosened, her arm falling to her side. Her eyes jumped between Rio's, searching for something - something more <em>complex,</em> a hidden meaning behind the words - but the brown orbs were clear, no shadows lurking in their depths.</p><p>"That's it?" she asked, almost offended by the simplicity of the answer.</p><p>"Yeah. That's it," Rio adjusted the strap of her backpack, absentmindedly fiddling with a loose string. "It's only been a day, and you've already spent so much time fighting this, Agatha. Fighting me. Fighting <em>yourself</em>."</p><p>"I'm not fighting myself," the denial came too quickly, too hastily to sound genuine.</p><p>Rio noticed immediately, something knowing shining in her eyes. "Right."</p><p>Agatha hated the way it made her feel. Like Rio had seen <em>through</em> her, had reached into the tangled mess of her thoughts and plucked the one she was desperate to ignore.</p><p>She stepped back, arms crossed tightly over her chest. "So, what, you're fine with this?"</p><p>Rio sighed, the length of her shift reflected in the dark circles under her eyes. "Would it make you feel better if I said no?"</p><p>Agatha hesitated. Would it?</p><p>Would it make her feel better to know that Rio struggled with this too? That she was not the only one caught in the spiral?</p><p>Or would it make everything worse?</p><p>Rio must have seen the flicker of uncertainty on her face because she softened, the impatient edges of her voice smoothing out. "Look, I don't know what you want me to say. Our situation isn't <em>normal</em>; we both know it. But it's happening whether we like it or not."</p><p>Agatha hated that she was right.</p><p>"Maybe you'd feel better if you stopped treating it like a war," Rio added, her voice quieter now. "Or at least understand I'm your ally, not the enemy."</p><p>She scowled. "I know that."</p><p>Did she?</p><p>Rio doubted it too, if her pointed look was anything to go by.</p><p>"I <em>do</em>," Agatha insisted.</p><p>"Sure," Rio drawled, turning toward the stairs. "Come on, you need sleep."</p><p>Agatha wanted to argue. Wanted to keep prying at this, picking it apart until she found a loose thread to pull - to unravel the younger woman.</p><p>But her limbs felt heavy, her headache was only getting worse, and she did not have the energy to keep pretending she was not exhausted.</p><p>So, for once, she let Rio lead the way.</p><p>Just this once.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha jolted awake, her eyes snapping open as a loud thud echoed through the house, slicing through the lingering haze of sleep. Her heart pounded as she shot upright, nausea immediately rising in her throat in protest at the abrupt movement. She stilled, blinking rapidly, scanning her dimly lit bedroom as if the source of the noise might somehow reveal itself.</p><p>The bedside clock glowed back at her - barely past eight. Too early for the unexpected commotion. Unless-</p><p>She threw the covers back, her bare feet sinking into the plush rug as she pushed herself upright. Nicky had to be awake by now, which only made the noise more concerning.</p><p>Her gaze flickered to the glass of water and painkillers waiting on her nightstand - a small mercy from her drunken self. She grabbed them both, downing the pills before pressing her fingers against her throbbing temples. Her muscles were stiff, her skin still carried the faint scent of the bar, and her head pounded in dull, rhythmic pulses.</p><p>But there was no time to dwell on any of that.</p><p>She hurriedly put on her slippers, the soft fabric barely cushioning the coolness of the floor, and shuffled toward the door, grabbing the robe off the hook as an afterthought. The material was thin, almost weightless, but still put up a fight, forcing her to wrestle with it as she descended the stairs, threading her arms through the sleeves with clumsy determination.</p><p>By the time she reached the bottom step, the robe still hung loosely around her, the belt slipping from her grasp as she tried to tie it properly. She exhaled sharply, tightening the string around her waist as she entered the kitchen. Her gaze remained fixed on the lopsided knot, her fingers working to center it over her navel, though the stubborn fabric refused to cooperate.</p><p>She growled lowly, gripping one end to undo the knot and try again when an amused voice made her look up fast enough for something in her neck to crack.</p><p>"Good morning, sunshine," Rio was at the stove, one hand wrapped around a spatula while the other rested on a pan's handle. The smell of pancakes wafted through the air as she craned her neck to glance at Agatha, a teasing smirk curling the corners of her lips.</p><p>Agatha blinked, her gaze jumping between the woman's face and her attire - a well-loved T-shirt with some band's name printed on the front, black sweatpants slightly rumpled from wear, and green socks speckled with tiny red flowers. Her eyes lingered on how the shirt slipped off Rio's shoulder, baring a hint of skin, and how one pant leg had ridden up, clinging just below her knee.</p><p>She swallowed hard, an unexpected unease curling in her stomach. There was something <em>unnervingly</em> domestic about the sight - about Rio standing there, completely at ease, making breakfast as if she belonged in the house - in her <em>life</em>.</p><p>"How did you sleep?" Agatha glanced up at the question, shaking off the strange feeling fluttering between her ribs.</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>"I hope the painkillers helped," Rio said casually, flipping the pancake with practiced ease. "I figured you might need them."</p><p>Agatha's breath stuttered at the offhanded acknowledgment. Last night's memories were blurry at the edges, bits and pieces of scattered moments she could not put together, but some were more persistent than others.</p><p>Like the warmth seeping through her clothes when she stood pressed against Rio's side, the driver's casual assumption, their conversation from the hall, Rio's measured tone and serious eyes.</p><p>Like the steady hand holding her elbow as she painstakingly climbed the stairs, leading her to her bedroom.</p><p>Like the soft voice asking her if she needed anything else and her somewhat shy request for painkillers and water.</p><p>"They haven't had the time to start working yet," she muttered, closing her eyes to fight off the onslaught of memories, each more embarrassing than the last.</p><p>When she reopened them, Rio was looking at her over her shoulder with a lopsided smile. "Really? Couldn't tell; you look amazing."</p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms around herself, a wave of self-consciousness crashing over her as dread settled low in her stomach.</p><p>She could imagine what Rio saw - the hastily tied robe, last night's makeup clinging to her skin, undoubtedly smudged, and a tangled mess of unwashed hair perched atop her head like a bird's nest.</p><p>A complete disaster.</p><p>"I don't think I've ever seen you with your hair down," Rio continued, sliding the pancake onto the growing stack. "It's longer than I expected."</p><p>She <em>hadn't</em> because Agatha never let her.</p><p>Tight buns were as much a part of her professional persona as tailored suits and sharp words - a carefully constructed armor, built to keep distance, to <em>maintain control</em>.</p><p>And yet, here she was. In her fluffy slippers, wrapped in a poorly tied robe, her hair falling well below the middle of her back in loose waves - her defenses crumbling the moment she had stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>Still, Agatha pushed down the mortification rising in her throat. She refused to feel embarrassed over looking like that in her <em>home</em>.</p><p>This was her turf, not Rio's. If anything, it should be the woman feeling bad over her casual looks.</p><p>"Well, I didn't have the time to put myself together," she bit back, jumping on the offense. "Considering the ruckus you've been causing."</p><p>Even without seeing her face, Agatha could hear the smile in Rio's voice as she spoke. "And you rushed to my rescue? My hero."</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth, too hungover for the games. "I thought it was Nicky."</p><p>To her surprise, Rio chuckled, turning around to lean against the counter with her arms crossed. "You thought your ten-year-old son was making pancakes?"</p><p>Agatha scoffed, tugging at the off-centered knot holding her robe together. "I was afraid that he might <em>try</em>."</p><p>Nicky rarely went against her direct orders - one of which was not to go near the stove without her supervision - but he was still a child, susceptible to dangerous ideas. The last thing she needed on top of her hangover was a trip to the ER or a burning kitchen.</p><p>"He's great at flipping them," Rio said casually, refocusing on the stove. "Pouring them out, too. You've got a little chef in the making."</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened, mindlessly following the woman's movements. "He- what?"</p><p>Her reaction made Rio pause. The batter dripped off the ladle as it hovered uncertainly over the sizzling pan when Rio glanced over her shoulder again, amusement replaced by uncertainty. "I, um, he wanted to help, so I let him make a few. Is that okay?"</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then closed it, trying to find the words. Nicky was a sweet kid, always eager to lend a hand in carrying groceries, setting the table, or even organizing her files when he wanted to feel useful. Paired with his insistent eagerness to learn everything, the offer to help was unsurprising.</p><p>Still, something about the situation irked her. The image of Rio and Nicky laughing at the stove, making pancakes, and having fun while she was sound asleep flashed before her eyes, and she pursed her lips.</p><p>Rio was just another adult in the house. She had no obligation to Nicky, no relationship that mandated teaching him his way around the kitchen, teaching him <em>anything,</em> for that matter.</p><p>And yet, she had.</p><p>The thought settled heavily in Agatha's chest. Rio was not just existing in this house; she was integrating, slowly fitting into the rhythm of their lives. There was an ease to it, a steady confidence that made Agatha feel off-balance like she was watching something shift beneath her feet without her permission.</p><p>She crossed her arms, voice measured. "You didn't have to teach him."</p><p>Rio's eyebrow twitched, her eyes snapping back to the stove and the drooping batter. She quickly poured the pancakes, her hand quivering as she dropped the ladle back into the bowl. Then, she turned to Agatha, her voice softening. "I know."</p><p>"Then why?"</p><p>Rio worried her lower lip, fingers flexing around the spatula. "Because he wanted to learn, and I didn't see a reason to say no," she tilted her head, eyes searching Agatha's face. "Did I overstep?"</p><p>Agatha sighed, her fingers drumming against the counter as she took in Rio's posture - the slight hunch of her shoulders, the way she shifted her weight from one foot to the other. Her nervousness was palpable in the air, so different from the usual confidence that Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Saying yes felt unfair; she knew Nicky could be persistent and hard to say no to.</p><p>Saying no felt like letting go of something she had not realized she was holding onto.</p><p>She opened her mouth, unsure what words would come out, when the soft patter of footsteps drew her attention.</p><p>Nicky shuffled into the kitchen, still in his dinosaur-print pajamas, his hair a messy halo around his head. His face lit up the moment he saw her.</p><p>"Mama, you're awake!" he beamed, barreling into her and wrapping his arms around her waist in a tight hug.</p><p>Agatha's expression softened instantly, the tension in her shoulders easing as she instinctively smoothed a hand over his curls.</p><p>"Good morning, baby," she murmured, pressing a kiss to the crown of his hair. His warmth and enthusiasm settled something inside her, pushing aside whatever strange feelings had been creeping up on her.</p><p>Nicky pulled back just enough to look up at her, eyes bright. "Did you see them? Rio let me help!" his little chest puffed with pride as he pointed toward the impressive stack of pancakes piled on a plate beside the stove. "I flipped some all by myself!"</p><p>Agatha's gaze flickered to Rio, who was watching the interaction with a careful expression like she was not sure how Agatha would react.</p><p>"You did?" Agatha replied, brushing a curl from Nicky's forehead. "And they didn't end up on the ceiling?"</p><p>Nicky giggled, shaking his head. "Nope! Rio said I did <em>really</em> good!"</p><p>Rio snorted, finally relaxing enough to smirk. "He did. No pancakes were harmed in the process."</p><p>"You have to try 'em, Mama," Nicky detached himself from her side, skipping to the stacked pile. He stopped a foot away from the counter, looking at Rio in a silent ask for permission.</p><p>"Go ahead," Rio encouraged him gently, grabbing the plate and placing it in his hands. "You got it?"</p><p>Nicky tightened his grip, testing the weight when Rio let go. "Yeah," he nodded before turning back to Agatha, who was watching the interaction in stunned surprise.</p><p>There was already <em>familiarity</em> between them, evident in the way Nicky knew not to reach for the plate himself or stray too close to the stove. Agatha wanted to believe she had drilled those habits into him, that his careful patience was a result of <em>her</em> teachings.</p><p>But she doubted it.</p><p>The exchange felt too practiced - like a continuation of something she had not been there to witness.</p><p>Unease coiled in her chest once again as she took in the silent understanding between them that seemed too natural for the short time they had known each other.</p><p>"Mama, let's go!" Nicky's impatient huff snapped her out of her thoughts, her gaze jumping between the plate in his hold and Rio, still at the stove, still looking <em>domestic</em>.</p><p>She hesitated again. "I'm not sure-"</p><p>"Nicky set the table for you," Rio interjected, making the boy grin.</p><p>"Because it's your birthday weekend!" he explained. "Rio said it can be like a gift!"</p><p>Agatha could not help the soft smile as it stretched her lips. "You already gave me a gift, baby," she said gently, nodding to the handmade card stuck to the fridge with a Baymax magnet they had gotten at Disney World.</p><p>Nicky shrugged, the pancakes wobbling precariously with the movement. "You deserve all the gifts, Mama," he said matter-of-factly as if it were the simplest truth in the world.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat tightening in a way that had nothing to do with her lingering hangover. She reached out, steadying the plate in his hands before he accidentally sent his heartfelt gesture crashing to the floor.</p><p>"Well," she murmured, blinking rapidly. "Who am I to argue with that logic?"</p><p>His grin widened, his restless feet already carrying him to the dining room. "Come on, before they get cold!"</p><p>Agatha followed him almost mechanically, her steps slow, hesitant. She glanced back at the kitchen once, her mouth twitching as if she wanted to say something.</p><p>Rio was watching them, still holding the spatula, her expression unreadable. Something warm flickered in her gaze - something that made Agatha look away before she could try to name it but still lingered at the back of her mind when she obediently took her seat at the set table.</p><p>The vase caught her eyes almost immediately.</p><p>At the center of Nicky's carefully arranged chaos - mismatched plates, skewed cutlery, cups placed at odd angles - stood the bouquet Rio had given her. Bold and unapologetic, as if it had always belonged there.</p><p>She had forgotten placing it on the table, forgotten the unnecessary turmoil of deciding where to put the flowers so they would not feel like they were following her around the house.</p><p>Yet, here they were. Unavoidable, much like Rio.</p><p>Her gaze lingered on them for a second too long, tracing the petals before taking in the rest of the ensemble.</p><p>A subtle frown pulled at her eyebrows as she counted the plates.</p><p>Three.</p><p>Of-fucking-course.</p><p>Nicky slid into the seat on her right, the plate of pancakes balancing near the table's edge. She grabbed it automatically, moving it to rest a few inches from the vase, her eyes still glued to the unoccupied spot.</p><p>Did Rio know about it? Did she <em>tell</em> Nicky to take her into account?</p><p>"Mama, can you help?" Nicky shuffled forward on his chair, his small arm shooting out to reach the plate she had put just out of his range.</p><p>"Right, sorry," she pulled it closer, placing it between them.</p><p>Her heart almost melted when he carefully speared his fork through three pancakes, transferring them to her plate with a grin. "Here you go!"</p><p>She smiled, the growing lump in her throat almost bringing tears to her eyes. "Thank you, baby."</p><p>"You're welcome!" he mirrored her smile, his entire face glowing. Agatha felt happiness bloom in her chest at the satisfaction in his eyes, the unadulterated joy from helping her. Sometimes, she wondered what she had done to deserve such a sweet boy.</p><p>Then, Nicky shifted in his seat again, angling his body toward the kitchen. "Rio!"</p><p>Before Agatha could comprehend what was happening, the answering shout reached her ears, making her blood run cold. "Yeah, yeah, I'm coming!"</p><p>Right. <em>Her</em>.</p><p>She bit the inside of her cheek, thinking of the best way to tell Rio to make herself scarce with Nicky present. Somehow, the <em>fuck off</em> simmering on her tongue seemed inappropriate.</p><p>The soft patter of footsteps in the hall sent a fresh wave of dread rolling through her. It was slow but inevitable - an incremental rhythm, each step a harbinger of doom.</p><p>The prelude to disaster.</p><p>The arrival of the Four Horsemen.</p><p>Well, maybe that was a bit <em>too </em>dramatic.</p><p>But in her defense, she was still hungover. And annoyed.</p><p>Rio rounded the corner in all her <em>domestic</em> glory, a pot of fresh coffee and another, albeit smaller, plate of pancakes in her hands.</p><p>"Everything looks great, <em>chef</em>," she addressed Nicky with a playful wink, placing the pot within Agatha's reach. "You have a real feast set-"</p><p>Agatha saw the moment Rio's eyes fell on the empty seat, noticed the subtle twitch of her jaw, the flicker of hesitation in her gaze.</p><p>Suddenly, she realized the woman had nothing to do with the third plate.</p><p>It was all Nicky.</p><p>Oblivious to the sudden shift in the air, the boy leaned forward, casually scooping a serving onto his plate. The pancakes landed haphazardly, one barely making it onto the dish, but he did not seem to notice.</p><p>Instead, he glanced up at Rio - still frozen beside Agatha, still staring at the seat so obviously meant for her.</p><p>His forehead scrunched up at her hesitation. "Me and Mama always sit here," he said, pointing between the two occupied chairs, not noticing Agatha's shocked expression.</p><p>"I wasn't sure where you wanted to sit, so I just picked for you," he gave a little shrug, his face growing sincere. "But you can sit somewhere else if you want. I won't be upset."</p><p>With the promise, he focused on his pancakes, dousing them in a concerning amount of syrup.</p><p>Agatha jumped when Rio cleared her throat, stepping back from the table.</p><p>"That's very nice of you, Nicky," the woman said softly, gaze flicking between the unbothered boy and his mother. "But this is your gift for your mom. I'll eat in the kitchen."</p><p>Nicky frowned, stopping his attempt at cutting the pancakes with his fork. "Why? You helped!" he protested, looking at Agatha for help. "Rio can stay, right, Mama?"</p><p>Agatha hesitated, caught between the expectant look in Nicky's wide eyes and the alarm bells ringing in her head.</p><p>It was their second day of living together.</p><p>The deal had been on for barely forty-eight hours.</p><p>And Rio had already slipped into this space that was supposed to belong only to the two of them - dragged into it by the oblivious boy who was too kind for his own good. Helping him make breakfast. Teaching him new things.</p><p>All while dressed like she <em>belonged</em>.</p><p>And yet, Agatha could not find a <em>valid</em> reason to send her away.</p><p>"Of course, she can stay," she finally said, the words feeling heavier than they should.</p><p>Nicky beamed, scooting over to make more room as if they would need to squeeze together to fit at the enormous table. "See? It's better when we all eat together!"</p><p>Rio slowly rounded the table, her eyes darting to Agatha as if expecting her to change her mind, to shoo her away. When all she found was a tight press of lips and an impatient glare, she lowered herself into the seat. "Guess this is happening, then."</p><p>
<em>Our situation isn't normal; we both know it. But it's happening whether we like it or not.</em>
</p><p>Rio's words from the night before echoed in her ears, bringing forth the memories of their conversation. The ridiculously simple solution not to overthink their situation. To stop fighting it. Herself. <em>Rio.</em></p><p>Her fingers tightened around her fork, her gaze locked onto the woman sitting across from her.</p><p>It would not be that simple. She could not just <em>let</em> Rio slip past every defense, could not allow herself to be laid bare. She had already let too much slip - had already let Rio take care of her when she was at her most vulnerable.</p><p>But she could try to be <em>civil</em>. To stop treating Rio like an intruder in her home. Like the enemy.</p><p>Catching the woman's eye, she eased the death grip on her fork, her lips parting on a silent word.</p><p>Truce?</p><p>Rio read it effortlessly, recognition lighting up her face as she nodded, her smile soft and genuine.</p><p><em>Truce</em>, she mouthed back.</p><p>It had to be enough to survive the next three-hundred-sixty-three days.</p><p>Not that Agatha was counting.</p><hr/><p>The truce turned out to be more of a lax agreement scribbled at the back of a receipt than an elaborate document calling for peace. As feeble as Agatha's resolution to act civil toward the newest inhabitant of her home.</p><p>In all fairness, Rio was not a <em>terrible</em> person to live with. True to her words, she kept the house clean, stayed away from Agatha's part of the fridge, and moved through the shared spaces with the ease of someone accustomed to coexisting with others. Despite Agatha's suspicions, the plants did not multiply behind her back, and Rio tended to them with such gentle care that it became increasingly difficult to stay mad at the scattered greenery.</p><p>Nicky had developed a habit of insisting they ate together whenever their schedules aligned. But Rio was rarely up in time for breakfast - making Agatha suspect, with some reluctance, that the morning after her birthday had been a calculated effort to let her sleep despite Nicky's boundless energy. And she was often absent at dinner, caught between classes, work, and time with her friends.</p><p>If Agatha focused hard enough, she could almost forget about her.</p><p>Almost, because when Rio <em>was</em> home, she made sure her presence was felt.</p><p>Whether it was the faint hum of music drifting from the kitchen as she cooked, the sound of her laughter as she chatted on her phone, or the way she always seemed to take up space without trying - leaning against counters, sprawling on the couch, claiming the kitchen like it was hers by right.</p><p>It was not obnoxious, not a desperate attempt at trying to make a foreign space feel like home. If anything, it was maddeningly natural, like Rio had always been there, like she belonged.</p><p>And that, more than anything, was what got under Agatha's skin.</p><p>Because Rio <em>did not</em> belong.</p><p>She was supposed to be a temporary fixture, a name on a piece of paper that made the deal work - not someone who fit into Agatha's carefully structured life with such effortless ease.</p><p>Yet, every time Agatha walked into a room, there was a sign that Rio had been there. Even without considering the plants - she had begrudgingly accepted their existence - there was always a half-finished cup of tea on the counter or a blanket thrown haphazardly over the back of the couch.</p><p>And then there was Nicky.</p><p>If Agatha had thought her son would remain neutral in all of this, she had been sorely mistaken. Nicky liked Rio. He <em>really</em> liked her.</p><p>The kind of like that had him lingering in the kitchen to talk to her after school. The kind that had him asking if Rio would be home for dinner. The kind that made Agatha lift the rule of Rio not using the living room so they could play stupid video games together.</p><p>It irked Agatha - all of it - but overall, she had to admit the first three weeks of living together had passed in relative peace, disrupted only by meaningless arguments over the right way of putting the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and the volume of Rio's music.</p><p>In hindsight, she should have expected they had been <em>too</em> peaceful.</p><p>It was her life, after all. Things rarely stayed quiet for long.</p><p>The ball dropped on Sunday, right after she had sent Nicky to bed and settled on the couch with a book in hand, hoping to relax before another week of whiny clients and incompetent interns.</p><p>Her phone's insistent buzzing tore through the quiet like a knife, making her close her eyes behind her glasses in annoyance.</p><p>A sinking feeling in her stomach foreshadowed the caller's ID before she even saw it, but her breath still caught in her throat when the screen flashed ominously, the dreaded name staring back at her.</p><p>
<em>Mother.</em>
</p><p>Three weeks.</p><p>It took longer than she had anticipated. Agatha half-expected Evanora to call the day after her birthday - not on the day itself to spare herself the trouble of wishing her a happy birthday - to interrogate her about the sudden change in her marital status.</p><p>When the silence persisted, she figured her mother had been watching, trying to find the evidence to discredit her before calling to let her know the scheme had fallen apart in the first weeks.</p><p>With a shaky exhale, Agatha swiped her finger over the accept button, pressing the phone to her ear.</p><p>"Do I not deserve an invitation to your wedding?"</p><p>No 'hello'. No 'how are you?'. No 'sorry for missing your birthday'.</p><p>Just a prickly, aggravated hiss that made her sink further into the cushions, the book forgotten in her lap.</p><p>"Hello, Mother," she said, not bothering to hide the annoyance in her voice. "We didn't have a wedding, as I'm sure you're aware."</p><p>Evanora growled on the other side of the call. "Watch your tone, <em>girl</em>. Did you really think I wouldn't see through your lies?"</p><p>Agatha bit back a remark about how she was forty and certainly not a <em>girl </em>anymore. "I don't know what you're talking about," she said instead, pushing her glasses up and resting them at the top of her head.</p><p>"Your so-called <em>marriage</em>," her mother hissed.</p><p>"I understand your <em>traditional</em> views are too limited to recognize it as a real marriage, but-"</p><p>"Enough!" Evanora barked into the receiver, making Agatha flinch. "That's a separate problem. Do you think I'm stupid? Or that you can outsmart me? Your little plan doesn't change anything regarding my will."</p><p>Agatha sucked on her teeth, readying the script she had prepared for the conversation. "My plan?"</p><p>"Your sham marriage!" the roar pierced her ear with a ferocity akin to a rabid animal aiming for someone's trachea. She pulled the phone back, feeling an involuntary shiver run down her spine. "Does your greed know no boundaries?! I've given you everything! And yet, when I decide to help others, you enter an immoral relationship just to spite me!"</p><p>"Not everything is about you, Mother," she bit back, ignoring how her stomach churned with Evanora's every word. "Certainly not my love life."</p><p>Evanora scoffed, a mocking edge in her voice. "Love life? You cannot be <em>that</em> stupid."</p><p>Agatha's lower lip trembled, already predicting her mother's next words, but they still sank into her heart like precisely thrown knives.</p><p>"You're not someone people <em>love</em>," Evanora said as if teaching her a valuable lesson. "You're a burden, a disappointment, but not someone people <em>want</em>."</p><p>Agatha's grip tightened around the phone, her knuckles whitening as she forced herself to take a steadying breath. She had heard those words before - variations of them, at least - sharpened over the years into weapons her mother wielded effortlessly. And yet, somehow, they still found their mark.</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p><p>She pressed her tongue to the roof of her mouth, swallowing down the familiar sting. "Well, someone wanted me enough to marry me, didn't they?" she said, the words almost defiant despite their untrue nature.</p><p>Evanora laughed, cold and humorless. "Oh, please. I don't know who this person is, but they certainly don't love you. They're using you. Just like you're using them."</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, still following her script. "<em>Her</em> name's Rio, and you don't know anything about our relationship."</p><p>"And <em>you</em> don't know anything about love," her mother countered. "Honestly, Agatha, do you really want me to believe anyone would want to marry you for <em>you</em>?"</p><p>The realization hit Agatha like a truck.</p><p>Evanora did not think the relationship was suspicious because of the convenient timing. She did not question not knowing about Rio's existence before the will had come to light or the almost clinical nature of their wedding.</p><p>No, she found it doubtful because it was <em>Agatha</em> - her unlovable, intolerable daughter who had seemingly found someone who wanted her.</p><p>Her tongue flexed uncomfortably in her mouth, a usually sharp knife dulled by her mother's callousness.</p><p>She scrambled for anything to say - a retort that would mask how deep Evanora's words had gotten under her skin - but before she could form a single syllable, a shadow moved in the doorway.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She stood there, leaning against the frame, arms crossed, her expression unreadable. How long had she been listening? <em>How much had she heard?</em></p><p>Agatha's heart lurched. Not from fear, not from embarrassment, but from the look in Rio's eyes - from the obvious, heavy <em>concern</em> shining in the warm pools of brown as they stared at her in silence.</p><p>Then, Rio moved.</p><p>She stepped forward in long, decisive strides, closing the distance between them until she stood by the coffee table, a mere foot from the phone trembling in Agatha's hand.</p><p>"My love," Rio said, steady and sure, loud enough for the speaker to catch every word. "I thought you were coming to bed?"</p><p>Agatha blanched, her gaze snapping up to search Rio's face for an explanation, but Evanora connected the dots faster.</p><p>"Was that your <em>so-called</em> wife?" she growled.</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly around the lump in her throat. "I have to go," she said, hating how her voice wavered.</p><p>"Not until<em> I</em> say so," her mother snapped. "I had hoped we could resolve this in a civilized manner, but I forgot how difficult you can be. I expect you and that woman at <em>Kestra </em>on Thursday. Four o'clock. <em>Maybe </em>then I'll talk some sense into you."</p><p>"I don't-"</p><p>The line went dead before she could finish, and the silence that followed was suffocating.</p><p>Agatha stared at the phone in her hand, Evanora's words still ringing in her ears. Their weight pressed down on her chest, thick and unrelenting.</p><p><em>Honestly, Agatha, do you really want me to believe anyone would want to marry you for </em>you<em>?</em></p><p>Her fingers curled around the device like she could crush the lingering echo, but it was already seared into her skin, embedded in her bones.</p><p>Then, Rio exhaled. Not loudly, not dramatically - just a slow, deliberate breath, like she was forcing herself to stay calm.</p><p>"You okay?" she asked, her voice softer than Agatha had ever heard.</p><p>Somehow, the solemn expression on Rio's face startled her more than her mother's words. She was used to Evanora's outbursts - to the cutting remarks and screaming matches, to being ridiculed and put down for existing - but seeing Rio serious struck a chord she did not want to touch.</p><p>A chord dangerously close to unraveling her.</p><p>So, she scoffed instead, shoving the phone into her pocket and forcing her expression into something wry and unimpressed. "Just a fun little chat with my mother. Always a pleasure."</p><p>Rio didn't laugh.</p><p>She just tilted her head, studying Agatha the way someone studies a puzzle with a missing piece.</p><p>Then, her mouth opened again, another question simmering on the tip of her tongue.</p><p>Agatha shot to her feet, grabbing the book from her lap. "I'm going to bed," she announced, already halfway to the door, Rio's eyes drilling holes into the back of her neck.</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>Her name left Rio's lips in a whisper - gentle, beckoning. But Agatha tensed as if she had shouted it.</p><p>"She's wrong."</p><p>Agatha froze. The words lingered in the air between them, heavy, undeniable.</p><p>She didn't turn around. She <em>couldn't</em>. If she did, Rio would see too much - how her fingers clenched around the book, how her throat bobbed as she swallowed back the sting in her eyes.</p><p>She didn't want comfort. She despised reassurances wrapped in soft voices and well-meaning looks. She <em>loathed </em>pity.</p><p>And yet-</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>Rio stood in the middle of the living room, hands moving restlessly near her hips like she was fighting to stay put. Like her instinct was telling her to do <em>something,</em> to reach out, to <em>fix, </em>but she knew Agatha would not accept it.</p><p>Agatha sighed, tearing her eyes away from the woman and turning to the dark staircase. "You don't know that. You don't know <em>me</em>."</p><p>"Then let me."</p><p>The words were so simple, so easy, and yet, they cracked something deep inside her.</p><p>Her grip on the book faltered, her shoulders slumped.</p><p>For a terrifying second, she considered it - turning around and letting Rio see past all the walls she had spent a lifetime building. Taking a sledgehammer to the stacked bricks and watching as the hurt poured out like infected blood from a wound. Cleansing her from all the rot her mother had caused.</p><p>But the walls were there for a reason. They were a dam holding back everything Agatha should not burden Rio with - Rio, who was in her house by design, a means to an end.</p><p>Tearing the walls would complicate the deal. It would make Agatha <em>vulnerable, </em>and business arrangements had no space for vulnerability.</p><p>So, instead, she straightened her spine, not sparing the woman another glance before walking out of the living room.</p><p>Her feet carried her to her bedroom on autopilot, her hands stiffly moving through her nighttime routine.</p><p>She purposefully avoided looking at herself in the mirror longer than necessary, wiping off her makeup in hard, decisive strokes that reddened her skin and sent sparks of pain through her nerves. When she stepped into the shower, the hot water rained on her in a steady stream, almost loud enough to drown out her thoughts as she scrubbed down her body until her pale complexion turned pink from the insistent drags of the loofah and the water's temperature.</p><p>By the time she slipped under the covers, her entire body ached, but the conversation still rattled in her mind like a pesky wasp circling her head to find the perfect occasion to strike.</p><p>Rio's gentle voice clashed with Evanora's furious hisses, making her temples throb and the lump in her throat grow.</p><p>Somewhere in the house, she heard the door to the guest bedroom close, and only then did Agatha let the tears flow, sliding down her cheeks and wetting her pillow. She clenched her teeth, stifling the sobs as her body trembled with the mixture of emotions suffocating her - the anger squeezing the air out of her lungs, the overwhelming despair wrapping tightly around her throat, the quiet acceptance creating cracks in her heart.</p><p>Evanora had been right. Rio did not want her for <em>her</em>. Their marriage <em>was</em> a ploy, a calculated move to secure the will.</p><p>Agatha knew all that.</p><p>Still, the situation, words, and conviction in her mother's voice stung.</p><p>They stung because, deep down, Agatha knew if it were not for the agreement, she would not be wanted, and her mother knew it too.</p><p>The realization made the tears flow harder, her muscles convulsing from the effort of staying quiet as she fell apart.</p>

Leave something if you enjoyed the chapter (or not, I can't tell you what to do), and for everyone who thought there would be a bigger breakthrough after the bar: you really thought Agatha is mature enough for that?

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The morning came too soon.</p><p>Agatha woke with a dull headache, brought on by the dehydration from a night of sobbing into her pillow and her mother's words still lingering in her mind, still clinging to her skin despite the thorough shower.</p><p><em>You're not someone people love</em>.</p><p>She shook the thought away and forced herself out of bed. Monday meant routine. Routine meant control.</p><p>Moving on autopilot, she readied herself for the day, which included an abnormal amount of concealer to hide the dark circles under her eyes, and headed to the kitchen. The coffee pot gurgled to life as she packed Nicky's lunch, her fingers scrolling through emails - each action mechanical, predictable.</p><p>Then, a door creaked somewhere in the house, slicing through the mind-numbing comfort of routine.</p><p>Her eyes flickered to the time - at least fifteen minutes too early for Nicky to be up and functioning. Slow, decisive footsteps sounded from the staircase, and the illusion of control the predictability of the morning offered shattered.</p><p>Mondays were one of the few days Rio emerged before nine, forced out of her room by early classes. The restless night had conveniently erased that information from Agatha's mind, and her stomach lurched when Rio rounded the corner - a walking reminder of last night's events.</p><p>Agatha had already locked the conversation with her mother in a vault, tossing the key into the void. Her mind was filled with lockboxes of Evanora's cruelty, each shoved so deep that, with enough time, they blurred into a foggy dream. Someone else's memory. If she was lucky, she even forgot they existed. Until her mother dragged them back into the light.</p><p>But usually, she made sure no one else saw - no witnesses to Evanora's words. Nobody to remember them but her.</p><p>"Morning," Rio murmured, running a hand through her damp her.</p><p>Agatha forced her muscles to relax despite the dread coiling in her chest. "Morning," she responded stiffly, keeping her voice neutral, disinterested.</p><p>Rio shuffled around her, making a beeline for the coffee machine, and Agatha instinctively stepped aside, eyes glued to the email she had been reading before the woman entered the kitchen.</p><p>The words blurred, letters swimming in her vision, refusing to make sense. She wasn't really reading - just using the screen as a shield, a flimsy excuse to avoid looking up. To avoid acknowledging the way her pulse hammered against her ribs, adrenaline coursing through her veins as she waited for the ball to drop.</p><p>Then, Rio cleared her throat, drumming her fingers against the fresh mug of coffee in her hand. "About Thursday-"</p><p>"I'm not talking about it," Agatha said sharply, her voice slicing through the air before Rio could get another word in. She did not look up, her gaze locked on the phone screen like it held the secret to disappearing into thin air.</p><p>Silence stretched between them, charged and heavy.</p><p>Rio sighed, the rhythmical tapping of her fingernails stopping. "Okay, but my car's still in the shop. We should probably figure out how we're getting there."</p><p>Agatha's grip on her phone tightened. She braced herself for concern, for questions she did not want to answer - but practicalities? Logistics? That threw her off.</p><p>She finally looked at the younger woman, her forehead creased. "We're driving together. It would look weird if we came separately."</p><p>Rio hummed into her coffee, accepting the answer. "Great."</p><p>The exchange felt underwhelming, so unlike what Agatha had thought it would be that she found herself speaking again before she realized it.</p><p>"Is your car fine? It's been almost two months."</p><p>Rio stilled, just for a second, before taking a slow sip of her coffee. "Yeah. I told you, the parts are a bitch to get. Still waiting for one."</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. "That long?"</p><p>Rio shrugged, the movement deliberately casual. "Some things take time."</p><p>It wasn't a lie, exactly, but it wasn't the truth either. Agatha knew that tone - carefully even, like walking on glass without drawing attention to the blood on your feet.</p><p>Her grip tightened around her mug.</p><p>The car wasn't in the shop because of a back-ordered part. It was in the shop because Rio could not pay for the labor.</p><p>Agatha should let it go. It wasn't hers to deal with.</p><p>Except it was, at least partially.</p><p>Moving into her house meant Rio had to commute <em>everywhere -</em> to work, university, even to see her friends - and there was only so far public transport could take her. Agatha had specifically told her to not crash at her old apartment after work, which left only one option: finding a way back to the house in the dead of night. And knowing Rio's limited resources, she doubted the woman was splurging on Ubers.</p><p>The implications - the long walks, the waiting at bus stops in the dark, the possible danger - made something unpleasant coil in Agatha's stomach.</p><p>"Who's the mechanic?" she asked, aiming for casual.</p><p>Rio frowned, eyeing her suspiciously. "Why?"</p><p>Agatha shrugged, tapping her nails against the counter. "Just wondering if they're actually working on your car or if you've been scammed into a never-ending repair job."</p><p>Rio snorted, shaking her head. "It's a shop Alice recommended. She knows the owner, so I doubt they're screwing me over."</p><p>"And yet, two months later, you're still hitchhiking your way around the city?"</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow over the rim of her cup. "I don't hitchhike."</p><p>"Then how do you get back?"</p><p>For a split second, Rio hesitated, barely noticeable, but enough to set off alarms in Agatha's mind.</p><p>"I manage," she said after a beat, setting her cup down with a quiet clink.</p><p>Agatha's jaw clenched. Manage. It was such a non-answer that it might as well have been a flashing neon sign screaming <em>I don't want to tell you</em>.</p><p>"Rio," she started, a warning laced in her tone.</p><p>But before she could push, Nicky came bounding into the kitchen, his presence immediately filling the space. "Good morning! Mama, have you seen my shoes? I want to wear the new ones."</p><p>Rio used the distraction to slip away, carrying her coffee as she headed for the stairs.</p><p>"I'll be late tonight," she called over her shoulder, her voice light and easy, as if the conversation had never happened.</p><p>Agatha watched her go, her fingers still curled into the countertop. The unease from earlier had not gone away. If anything, it settled deeper, urging her to take action.</p><p>It wasn't about <em>concern -</em> she didn't care if Rio got herself murdered or froze her ass off at a bus stop. Well, maybe she cared a little, but only because Rio was no use to her if she was dead.</p><p>No, it was about flashing her influence to regain control over the situation, about showing Rio she was not a damsel in distress, bullied by her own mother and unable to get herself home after a night out.</p><p>By lunch, she had all the needed details.</p><p>An hour later, the mechanic informed her that the car was ready to be collected.</p><p>Two hours after that, the door to her office swung open, cutting through the tranquil air.</p><p>The pen in Agatha's hand froze mid-word, pressing into the post-it note as her head snapped up, ready to berate the person barging into her space unannounced.</p><p>The sharp retort died on her lips the moment she saw Rio.</p><p>The door had barely clicked shut before Rio crossed the room in three quick strides, her expression a storm of barely restrained fury. She planted her hands on the desk, leaning in as she hissed, "What the hell do you think you're doing?"</p><p>Agatha set the pen down, unbothered by the steely look in Rio's eyes. "Working. How did you get into the building?"</p><p>"You paid for my car," Rio snapped, ignoring her question.</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to lean back in her chair, keeping her expression neutral. "I did. Did you break in here?"</p><p>Rio's nostrils flared. "Why?"</p><p>"I'm not answering any more of your questions until you answer mine," Agatha tilted her chin up, withstanding Rio's scalding glare. "<em>How did you get into the building?</em>"</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply through her nose, the muscle in her jaw twitching. "The security guards downstairs let me in," she bit out as if the words pained her. "Apparently, being your wife has its perks in this place, especially when said wife looks pissed enough."</p><p>Agatha made a mental note to talk to security about letting in furious women with unresolved issues. It felt like the basics of keeping everyone in the office safe. "Good to know."</p><p>Rio's hands flexed on the desk's sturdy surface as she leaned closer. "Don't change the subject. Why did you pay for my fucking car?"</p><p>"Because it needed fixing," she shrugged, tilting her head. "Also, in case that wasn't obvious, don't go around telling people here that we're married. I like to keep my life private."</p><p>Rio dismissed her comment with a scoff. "I didn't ask for your help. I don't <em>need</em> your help."</p><p>"You didn't, but it was inconvenient," she said simply. "I fixed the problem."</p><p>Rio let out a humorless laugh, pushing off the desk. "No. <em>I</em> fix my problems. <em>You</em> decided to swoop in and - what? Make me feel like a damn charity case?"</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, fighting the urge to roll her eyes. "It's a car, not a Make-A-Wish situation. And before you get too dramatic, it wasn't even that much."</p><p>"That's not the point!" Rio growled, making Agatha look toward her assistant's desk. Mercifully, she had sent him on an errand moments before Rio decided to disturb her peace, so he was not there to witness the exchange.</p><p>"Then what <em>is</em> the point?" she challenged, her gaze snapping back to Rio. "Would you rather keep taking the bus? Or whatever the fuck you were doing after your shifts? Or maybe you were hoping you'd stumble upon a pile of cash on your way back to the house?"</p><p>Rio's lips parted, but no sound came out.</p><p>Agatha took the opportunity to press on.</p><p>"It's done," she said, firm and final. "I don't expect anything in return. Just take the car and stop making it an issue."</p><p>Rio stared at her, expression unreadable. The anger was still there, simmering beneath the surface, darkening her brown eyes, but something else had taken root, something more vulnerable, almost hesitant.</p><p>Then, she blinked, and the look was gone, replaced by a defiant spark. "I'll pay you back," she declared, almost threatening, and Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Be my guest."</p><p>Before Rio could fire back, the sound of approaching footsteps made Agatha's stomach drop. She only had enough time to consider hiding Rio under her desk or tossing her out the window before the door to her office swung open.</p><p>Lilia and Jen strolled in like they owned the place, ignoring the dark glower Agatha shot their way.</p><p>"I'm busy," she grumbled, hoping they would take the hint.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, you always are," Jen shot back, completely unbothered as she let the door swing shut behind her. "We were just coming in to-"</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p>The room stilled.</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply at Lilia's startled tone, but it was Rio she looked at first. Because for a moment there had been something like <em>regret</em> flashing in those dark eyes, quickly stamped out and replaced with a practiced, easy smile.</p><p>"Hi, Lilia," Rio said, casual as ever. She even had the nerve to wave.</p><p>Lilia blinked once, then twice, her keen eyes flickering from Rio's face to Agatha's, to Rio's left hand, to finally rest on an identical gold band adorning Agatha's ring finger.</p><p>They watched her put the clues together in real-time, the gears in her head spinning as the pieces clicked into place with a shaky gasp.</p><p>"You married <em>Rio</em>?"</p><p>Jen frowned, following her friend's line of sight. "Wait, you're <em>married</em>?"</p><p>Agatha sank further into her chair, pinching the bridge of her nose.</p><p>She always knew they would find out - <em>eventually</em>. There was only so much she could do: drowning the wedding ring in other jewelry to make it unnoticeable, keeping her hand buried in her pocket, or tucking it beneath any available surface.</p><p>The behavior was unreasonable, it defeated the purpose of the marriage, which was to convince everyone, Evanora in particular, that the arrangement was real. Still, some people were private, unwilling to share their personal lives in the workplace, and Agatha figured that it didn’t undermine the lie, but simply fed into the persona she had developed at work - all business, no play.</p><p>The office was not a place for heartfelt confessions and personal revelations. She rarely participated in <em>small talk</em>, let alone deeper conversations, unless either Lilia or Jen cornered her. Which they hadn’t because she made sure to bend over backwards to keep the truth from them.</p><p>To be fair, she was surprised it had worked for that long.</p><p>But judging by the look on Lilia's face, she suspected the woman had noticed the moment the ring slipped onto her finger. She had simply chosen to wait, biding her time for the perfect moment to strike.</p><p>And now, that moment had arrived - delivered straight into her lap in the form of a pissed-off Rio, unable to use her phone to yell at Agatha like a normal human being.</p><p>"Honestly, Jen," she scoffed after a beat of silence, letting her hand drop. "How are you a lawyer? We're supposed to be observant."</p><p>Jen's mouth snapped open, ready to deliver a sharp retort, but Lilia's raised hand stopped her. "Don't. She's trying to distract us."</p><p>Agatha gasped, clutching her chest in mock offense. "Me?"</p><p>"It's not my fault you have an unhealthy addiction to jewelry," Jen huffed. "The ring is barely visible!"</p><p>"Almost like that's on purpose, huh?" Agatha fired back, glancing at Rio and hoping her eyes would convey the message of <em>why the fuck are you still here?</em></p><p>They did.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, stepping away from her desk. "Well, this has been lovely, but-"</p><p>"You're not going anywhere," Lilia cut in, her voice laced with quiet authority. To Agatha's surprise, Rio's shoulders slumped in defeat. She stuffed her hands into her pockets, her expression suddenly pliant like a scolded child's.</p><p>Agatha's curiosity spiked.</p><p>"How do you two know each other?" she asked, her eyes flicking between them.</p><p>Lilia arched a brow. "How do <em>you</em> know each other?"</p><p>"We're married," Rio quipped, earning twin unamused stares from both Agatha and Lilia. Pressing her lips into a thin line, she relented. "We met at the bar. And Lilia's Alice's godmother."</p><p>Agatha held back a groan. The universe <em>really</em> hated her.</p><p>"I <em>knew </em>you looked familiar!" Jen snapped her fingers, stepping closer as she eyed Rio. "You work at-"</p><p>"Okay, great," Agatha interrupted, pushing to her feet. "We all know each other. Now, get out of my office. I have work to do."</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. "Oh, please. Like you were working before we got here."</p><p>"I <em>was</em>!"</p><p>"Really? Because it looked like you were arguing with your <em>wife!"</em></p><p>Before Agatha could argue, Lilia took a deliberate step forward, fixing Rio with a pointed look. "You," she said, her voice still carrying that quiet authority that had so easily made Rio stand down before. "Explain yourself."</p><p>Rio's eyes flickered over to Agatha, a silent question in them.</p><p>
<em>Do you want them to know?</em>
</p><p>She didn't, not really.</p><p>The list of people who knew was already too long for her liking, and the more names they added to it, the greater the chance the deal could fall apart. The ice was already thin. Evanora was nowhere close to believing their marriage was real, and disclosing its true nature to an even wider audience posed a significant threat.</p><p>Then again, one look at the crease between Lilia's brows told her she already had her suspicions accompanied by an itch to get to the bottom of the issue.</p><p>She knew if Lilia put her mind to it, the deal could be uncovered by the end of the week.</p><p>"It's a long story," Rio finally said after Agatha's unhelpful silence stretched for too long.</p><p>Lilia crossed her arms, not buying the non-answer. "I have time."</p><p>"I don't," Agatha rounded her desk. "We're all at work, and Rio shouldn't even be here."</p><p>"Damn," Jen whistled, shooting the mentioned woman a compassionate look. "You met at your job, and she won't let you visit hers?"</p><p>Rio chuckled, vaguely gesturing to their modern surrounding. "Slightly different vibes."</p><p>"Yeah, <em>slightly,</em>" Agatha deadpanned, impatiently tapping her foot against the floor. "Unless you have something important to discuss..." she motioned to the door, a clear sign for everyone to leave.</p><p>Lilia didn't budge, her eyes narrowed as she crossed her arms. "I'm not going anywhere until you answer my questions."</p><p>"Yeah, actually, I'm kinda curious, too," Jen agreed. "We didn't know you were dating anyone. And why weren't we invited to the wedding?"</p><p>The vein in Agatha's forehead throbbed. She ran her fingers across it, willing to cast out the budding headache spreading across her skull.</p><p>"There was no wedding," she snapped, leaning back against her desk and bracing her hands on its edge. Upon noticing her friends' unbothered faces, she sighed, "Listen, this really isn't the place, okay? I have work to do, and so do you. We can talk about it some other time."</p><p>Lilia eyed her carefully as if calculating the risk of Agatha fleeing the country to avoid the topic.</p><p>Eventually, she relented with a slow exhale. "Fine, but this isn't over. We <em>will</em> discuss this."</p><p>"Can't wait," Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>"Come on, Jen." Lilia turned to leave, shooting Rio one last knowing glance before heading for the door. Jen shot them one last suspicious look before following her out, the door closing with a soft click.</p><p>Agatha slumped against her desk, leaning forward with a resigned groan.</p><p>Happy fucking Monday. The week was off to a fantastic start.</p><p>"Well," Rio mused, stuffing her hands into her pockets. "That was fun."</p><p>"This is your fault!" Agatha growled, straightening her spine. "You know phones exist, right? You didn't have to come here to yell at me for being altruistic."</p><p>"Altruistic? You-" Rio stopped herself, the angry spark in her eyes dying before it could take root. When she spoke again, her voice was measured, calm, "What are you going to tell them? Lilia won't believe our story."</p><p>"Yeah, Jen won't either."</p><p>"So...?"</p><p>Agatha slowly returned to the other side of the desk, sinking into her chair with a resigned sigh. "I'll tell them enough to stop them from digging into it."</p><p>Rio looked unconvinced. "Meaning?"</p><p>"I'll handle it," Agatha snapped, her words final. She grabbed the discarded pen and glanced at the half-finished note, only to realize she couldn't remember what she'd been writing before Rio barged in. "You can go now."</p><p>"I'm not your employee; you can't dismiss me," Rio pointed out. "They're your friends. Just tell them the truth."</p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened. "Did you not hear my mother? She already doesn't believe this is real. Every person we tell is a liability."</p><p>Rio studied her carefully, brows knitting together. "And out of everyone we told, you think <em>lawyers</em> will blab?"</p><p>It sounded ridiculous. It <em>was</em> ridiculous. Lilia and Jen were probably the safest people to trust - tight-lipped, trained to withhold the truth even under pressure, with years of courtroom experience, and used to dealing with entitled people like Evanora.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose, fiddling with the pen. "It's not about what I think. It's about control."</p><p>"Control?" Rio scoffed. "Over what?"</p><p>"Over how this plays out," Agatha leaned back in her chair, arms crossing tightly over her chest. "The second too many people know, the second <em>she</em> finds out, it's all gone."</p><p>Rio's expression shifted, her frustration melting into something sharper. "I don't know Jen, but Lilia won't run off to Evanora."</p><p>"It's not about <em>that</em>," Agatha snarled. "It's about loose ends. It's about keeping things airtight. Every person who knows is a risk, and you've already told Alice and Billy."</p><p>"You told Wanda," Rio argued defensively, making Agatha roll her eyes.</p><p>"Yes, and that's three people too many."</p><p>Rio stared at her for a long moment, something unreadable in her gaze. "Doesn't going through life without trusting anyone get exhausting at some point?"</p><p>The pen slipped out from Agatha's fingers, clattering loudly against the desk, but she barely heard it over the sudden rush of blood in her ears. Her eyes snapped to Rio's, searching for something - mockery, pity, frustration - but all she found was quiet sincerity, and somehow, that made it worse.</p><p>It made it worse because Rio saw through yet another defense, another carefully constructed wall.</p><p>She couldn't have that - couldn't give the woman the satisfaction of thinking she <em>understood </em>her actions.</p><p>"I trust people," Agatha hissed. "But this isn't about trust. It's about <em>risks</em>."</p><p>"What risks?" Rio challenged, taking a slow step forward. The desk still separated them, but it felt like a feeble defense against the storm brewing in the air. "Lying to them is more dangerous, and you know it. Lilia won't leave a single stone unturned if she realizes we lied, which she will because she won't believe we got married for-"</p><p>Agatha's mind supplied the unspoken word for Rio.</p><p>
<em>Love.</em>
</p><p>Lilia wouldn't believe they got married for love.</p><p><em>You're not someone people love</em>.</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply the moment recognition lit up Rio's eyes.</p><p>"That's not what I meant," the younger woman rushed to explain, her words quick, frantic as if they could erase the memory replaying in Agatha's mind.</p><p>But the damage was done.</p><p>Rio had unknowingly discovered the root of Agatha's reluctance to tell her friends about the true nature of their marriage.</p><p>It wasn't about keeping a secret. It wasn't about liabilities, dangers, and trust.</p><p>It was about testing people close to her, seeing if they would believe she had found someone who wanted her - someone who <em>loved</em> her.</p><p>Agatha bristled, noticing Rio's face soften, her stormy frustration ebbing into something gentler, dangerously close to concern.</p><p>"Fine, I'll tell them," she grumbled, once again reaching for the pen and focusing on the half-written note. Was it about that newest client? It could be. Maybe it was about that deal-</p><p>"Agatha," Rio said, her voice quieter. "You don't have to."</p><p>Agatha briefly considered throwing the pen into the woman's face, but she refused to look up from the unfinished memo.</p><p>"Can you make up your fucking mind? I said I'd tell them. It's the best course of action," the words were sharp, laced with venom meant to discourage further comments.</p><p>Rio shifted on her feet, filling the heavy, thick silence hanging between them as Agatha's eyes bore holes into the flimsy piece of paper. The pen trembled in her hand, the dread from their encounter in the kitchen resurfacing like a dormant beast.</p><p>Even without seeing Rio's expression, she could imagine her concerned face. She had seen it too many times already - the tensed jaw, the creased forehead, the subtle frown that made the woman's eyes seem darker.</p><p>However, no matter how many times Rio looked at her like that - like every clue offered her a deeper understanding of Agatha's actions, thoughts, <em>person </em>- it never failed to make her feel exposed.</p><p>Agatha had spent her entire life under a microscope, scrutinized either by her mother or the circle of her colleagues. She was used to the weight of people's stares, the way their gazes skimmed over her, searching for something they could dissect and pick apart. Every room she entered was filled with silent judgments and examining glances.</p><p>She had learned early on how to read those looks - how to recognize the moment someone decided she was too sharp, too distant, too <em>abrasive</em>. The flicker of wariness in their eyes when she spoke to bluntly. The subtle recoil when she didn't soften her edges to make them more comfortable. The quiet dismissal when they realized she wasn't the kind of woman who could be molded, who could be tamed.</p><p>It never mattered.</p><p>As long as they respected her competence, her intelligence, her status - Agatha let them believe whatever they wanted. She let the false assumptions pile up, let them build like bricks around her until their weight felt more permanent than the truth. The cold, untouchable mask molded to her face, eventually searing into her skin so she could never take it off, and whenever she met someone, it served as a warning sign, a bold statement that she was a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>But Rio looked at her through the spaces between the bricks, the tiny gaps where time had worn the mortar thin, leaving parts of Agatha exposed. She saw the cracks in the mask - the minuscule fractures no one had ever looked close enough to notice. But Rio had.</p><p>She had noticed those imperfections that night at the bar when Agatha had let her guard slip just enough, thinking it wouldn't matter. Thinking no one would <em>look</em>.</p><p>Of course, Rio had. And worse - she <em>kept </em>looking, refusing to focus on the parts Agatha voluntarily showed her: the cold, practiced exterior as hard as a shell.</p><p>No, Rio watched her through the cracks, as if that was the only way of seeing her properly. As if she <em>wanted</em> to understand her.</p><p>It left Agatha feeling exposed. Lost, even. Because nobody had ever looked past her facade with such ease.</p><p>Nobody cared enough to <em>see.</em></p><p>Rio inhaled softly. "I know you don't want to talk about it, but-"</p><p>"Then why fucking revisit it?" Agatha's voice trembled with the effort of keeping it even. Getting into a screaming match was not an option, not at her office, not where people could hear.</p><p>"Because she's <em>wrong</em>," Rio repeated the words from last night with even more conviction. "You're not unlovable."</p><p>Agatha's head snapped to look at the woman, and sure enough, the concern was right there - carved into Rio's worry lines and gleaming in her dark eyes. She clenched her teeth.</p><p>"I didn't ask for your input."</p><p>Rio didn't relent, her expression remaining stoic. "I'm giving it to you anyway because somebody has to tell you that. You're <em>not</em> unlovable."</p><p>She could feel the words fall on her, wrap around her, <em>embrace</em> her. They felt warm despite the steely conviction in Rio's eyes, soft despite the edge in her tone, and Agatha let them soothe her, let herself fall into them as they healed the gashes left by her mother's cruelty.</p><p>For a moment, she wondered if being seen was such a bad thing.</p><p>Her lips parted, the prickly defiance melting away into something quieter, something dangerously close to acceptance.</p><p>For once, Rio’s eyes on her didn’t feel intrusive, they didn’t make her think the younger woman was seconds away from learning her darkest secrets. They were filled with honesty and emanated that warmth Agatha always fought from fear of letting it swallow her whole.</p><p>But maybe it wouldn’t be that bad. Maybe she could-</p><p>A knock on the door startled them both. The pen in Agatha's hand ripped through the Post-it note, leaving a small indentation in the polished wood.</p><p>Her eyes shifted away from Rio as she looked at the door, straightening her spine and bracing her elbows on the desk, an indifferent mask on her face. "Come in."</p><p>Unlike her friends, who barreled into her office without a second thought, her assistant entered with the caution of a man stepping into shark-infested waters - without much of a choice, but still desperately hoping he wouldn't be the one bitten.</p><p>He squeezed through the barely open doorway, his lanky frame contorting awkwardly as he stumbled inside, his focus glued to his phone.</p><p>"I'm <em>so</em> sorry to interrupt, but-" he glanced up mid-sentence, his words dying in his throat the moment his eyes landed on Rio. He blinked as if his brain needed a moment to process what he was seeing. "<em>Rio</em>?"</p><p>Agatha's fingers twitched. <em>You've got to be fucking kidding me</em>.</p><p>Before she could tell her assistant to get lost, Rio grinned, her posture relaxing.</p><p>"Sup, Billy," she said casually as if her presence at the office was the most natural thing in the world, and Agatha groaned.</p><p>She remembered Rio mentioning Billy - an assistant at some firm. But in a city of over half a million people, there had to be hundreds, if not <em>thousands</em>, of Williams. The odds that <em>this</em> Billy was <em>her</em> Billy?</p><p>Fucking astronomical.</p><p>And yet, here they were.</p><p>She cleared her throat, dragging Billy's attention away from Rio. His eyes snapped to her, widening slightly at the unmistakable irritation written all over her face.</p><p>"I'm <em>busy</em>, Teen," she said, each word sharpened at the edges.</p><p>Billy gulped, but the warning in her tone was not enough to stop his gaze from dropping to her hand. His face shifted in real time, confusion melting into realization, into shock.</p><p>"Oh. <em>Oh,</em>" he staggered back as if the revelation physically hit him, his gaze bouncing between Agatha and Rio. "You - and - <em>oh my God.</em>"</p><p>Rio chuckled, watching as Billy floundered, his mouth opening and closing like a fish gasping for air.</p><p>"I think we broke him."</p><p>Agatha was not amused.</p><p>She pinched the bridge of her nose, once again wondering what she had done to deserve the universe's hatred.</p><p>Unable to come up with an answer, she braced her palms on her desk, pushing herself up as her eyes drilled into her assistant, carrying the weight of her next words.</p><p>"Teen," she said sternly, snapping him out of his stupor. He looked at her, wide-eyed and scared. "I hope you understand your knowledge of our... situation is confidential."</p><p>The warning in her voice unlocked his stunned body, making him nod vigorously. "Yes, of course."</p><p>"Which means," she continued, too focused on scaring the man into silence to flinch at the title. "That if anybody at this office learns about our deal, you'll be held accountable for it."</p><p>Billy's throat bobbed nervously. "I won't tell anyone," he said quickly. "I already promised Rio."</p><p>"He did," Rio added unhelpfully.</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw. "I don't care what you told her. Right now, you're not her friend, you're my assistant, and I need you to tell <em>me.</em>"</p><p>The prospect of finding another assistant was daunting.</p><p>Even without a law degree, Billy was good at keeping her professional life running like a well-oiled machine. He was equal parts gatekeeper, problem solver, and fire extinguisher - anticipating issues before they arose and handling them with efficiency. He had an uncanny ability to juggle ten tasks at once, from managing her impossible schedule to fielding calls from clients who thought "urgent" meant "mildly inconvenient".</p><p>However, his organizational skills weren't what made her reluctant to even consider finding someone to replace him. Organized people weren't rare, and with the company's reputation, she doubted she would have any trouble with lining up the candidates for the position. Agatha hated job interviews with a passion, but she could sit through a day or two of grilling people and making them squirm to see who would break.</p><p>Except she knew she wouldn't find anyone as <em>adaptable</em> as Billy.</p><p>He could read Agatha's mood with frightening accuracy, knowing exactly when to push, when to back off, and when to slip a much-needed coffee onto her desk without a word. His sharp memory, quick thinking, and ability to handle pressure made him indispensable.</p><p>He also had a habit of pushing his luck just enough to be amusing - but never enough to get fired.</p><p>"Mrs. Harkness," Billy hesitated, once again looking like a deer in headlights. "Wait, should I call you Mrs. Harkness-Vidal?"</p><p>Rio snorted just as Agatha's face contorted in a dangerous snarl. "Are you <em>trying </em>to get yourself fired, dude?"</p><p>"It's not my fault!" he argued, but his voice was more scared than defiant. "You were so secretive about it! <em>Oh, I got married, but it's a plan to pay off my student loans. If anybody asks, I’ve been dating her for a year. Anyway, don't worry about it,</em>" Rio rolled her eyes at the higher pitch of the words, an inaccurate imitation of her.</p><p>"I don't sound like that," she pointed out, crossing her arms. "And I told you enough."</p><p>"You could've warned me you married <em>my boss</em>!"</p><p>"I didn't <em>know </em>she was your boss! You rarely mention her name!"</p><p>"You could've given me a better description than a hot-" he stopped himself, eyes darting to Agatha's raised brows and pursed lips. Clearing his throat, he ran a hand through his well-maintained curls, undoubtedly greasing it. The amount of hair gel he used was concerning. "I-"</p><p>"No, please, keep acting like I'm not here, <em>in my office</em>," Agatha growled. "We didn't hyphenate our names."</p><p>She wouldn't be caught dead adding Rio's surname to her own. The deal had already taken enough from her - control, pride, free will - she would never give it her <em>identity</em>.</p><p>Not to mention that she would probably spontaneously burst into flames if anybody called her Mrs. Harkness-Vidal.</p><p>"Of course, of course, I'm sorry," Billy muttered quickly, averting his gaze. "I won't tell anyone about this, I swear. I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize your reputation here or anywhere else, Mrs. Harkness."</p><p>Agatha lustrated him briefly, weighing his sincere tone and the subtle spark of fear in his eyes. Satisfied with the answer, she nodded, removing her hands from the desk and bracing them on her hips.</p><p>"Great," she said, turning her attention to Rio. "I have to get back to work. Leave."</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at the sharp tone, her gaze flicking to Billy as if debating whether to tell him to step outside so she could finish their previous conversation. Agatha could already see the thought forming and opened her mouth to shut it down before it left Rio's lips.</p><p>But Rio, ever the pain in her ass, simply smirked and strolled toward the door at her own pace, ignoring the tension humming in the air. As she passed Billy, she clapped a hand on his shoulder in mock sympathy.</p><p>"Good luck," she laughed, her tone dripping with amusement. Billy flinched like she had just handed him a live grenade.</p><p>Agatha was seconds away from snapping at her, but Rio was already reaching for the door handle. Just as she pulled it open, she glanced back over her shoulder, her smirk widening into something deliberately smug.</p><p>"See you at home, <em>wifey</em>."</p><p>Agatha's fingers shot toward the nearest object - a stapler, maybe, or a paperweight - but before she could launch it across the room, Rio was already gone, leaving nothing but the faint echo of her laughter behind.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The next day, Agatha found herself in a private booth of a restaurant near the office, still dressed in her work clothes, Jen and Lilia's expectant eyes on her as she sipped on her water.</p><p>The reason for the impromptu dinner hung heavily in the air, gaining weight with every second she spent sifting through the menu, talking to the waiter, and checking her phone as if the passing time could discourage her friends from interrogating her.</p><p>She put down her glass and reached for her phone again when Jen finally snapped.</p><p>"Stop ignoring us and start talking!"</p><p>Agatha slowly put the device on the table, screen up so she could see any incoming messages, and leaned back in her chair.</p><p>"The weather's been improving, don't you think?" she asked casually, relishing the frustration simmering in Jen's eyes.</p><p>"Agatha," Lilia said, the warning in her voice clear and sharp. "You know why we're here. Wouldn't you rather get this over with and go home?"</p><p>She would, especially since the regular babysitter could only watch Nicky for the next hour. Then, Rio would take over - a new development stemming from Sharon's unavailability for the rest of the evening.</p><p>Who knew annoying widows had such a busy life?</p><p>Still, she refused to let up that easily.</p><p>"Am I supposed to read your minds?" she scoffed, raising her eyebrows in a challenge. "If you want something from me, <em>ask</em>."</p><p>Jen groaned, rubbing her temples as if Agatha's games physically pained her. "Do you have to be a pain in the ass about everything?"</p><p>Agatha snapped her fingers. "Excellent question - yes."</p><p>Lilia exhaled sharply, cutting in before Jen could take the bait. "What's the story with you and Rio?" her voice was steady, measured - the same tone she used in court when cornering an uncooperative witness. "Tell us from the beginning."</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. She knew that tone. Once it entered a conversation, there was no escaping it. The time for sarcasm and deflections had run out.</p><p>She leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. "I met her at the bar the night Jen abandoned me," she began, shooting the mentioned woman a nasty glare to make her scorn clear.</p><p>"I had a break-"</p><p>"Let her talk," Lilia interrupted, raising her hand to silence Jen's protest. Jen huffed but nodded for Agatha to continue.</p><p>Agatha drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flicking toward the door to make sure they were still alone. Their collective status had secured them a private room at the restaurant - no prying ears, no curious ears. Good.</p><p>Before Evanora's call, she didn't care about discussing the arrangement in public places, aware that her mother was not <em>that</em> interested in her life to have people follow her around the clock. But now that the battle had begun, the warhorn blaring loud the moment the word "Mother" flashed on her phone screen two days ago, she had to take every precaution.</p><p>Now, she had to be careful. Every conversation was a risk: every word, a weapon.</p><p>Satisfied that they were alone, she exhaled. When she spoke again, her voice was quieter but sure. "I stayed to drown some sorrows, and Rio took over the bar for Alice. She grilled me about my life, and after I told her why I was there, she offered a solution to my problem. We got married a few weeks later. She moved in the day before my birthday."</p><p>Silence settled over the table, thick and expectant.</p><p>Then the door swung open.</p><p>A waiter entered, arms stacked with plates. He moved quickly, sensing the tension in the room, and disappeared with nothing more than a polite nod.</p><p>Jen waited until his footsteps faded before speaking. "That was vague as shit, and you know it," she grabbed the cutlery, pointing a knife at Agatha for emphasis.</p><p>Lilia didn't touch her food. Instead, she studied Agatha with sharp, calculating eyes. "What was the problem?" she asked. "And why did you have to get married?"</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, chin jutted out in defiance. "Is it that hard to believe we fell madly in love and decided to get hitched?"</p><p>Jen snorted. "Knowing you? Yes."</p><p>The words stung more than she cared to admit. Before she could mask their impact, Lilia shot Jen a warning glare, her expression softening when she turned back to Agatha.</p><p>"You're crazy, but not <em>that</em> crazy. You wouldn't do it without considering Nicky," she said as if apologizing for Jen's reaction. "So, why did you have to get married?"</p><p>Agatha sighed, the fight gone from her body.</p><p>"I'm not telling you every detail," she warned, taking a page out of Rio's book - she would give the essential information to satiate her friends' curiosity and then tell them the version designed for everyone else. "But it was because of my mother. I married Rio to throw a wrench in her plans, and now we have to convince her the marriage is real. The official story is that we'd been dating for a year before the trip to the courthouse."</p><p>Jen and Lilia exchanged a glance.</p><p>Lilia, ever the composed one, folded her hands on the table. "<em>Evanora </em>forced you to marry Rio?"</p><p>Agatha reached for her fork, swirling it in the pasta, her appetite gone. "Forced is a bit strong, and it didn't have to be Rio. But sure, you can say that."</p><p>"Jesus," Jen whispered, her voice lacking the usual mocking edge. "That's fucked up."</p><p>"You're not going to give us more details, are you?" Lilia prodded, still looking at her questioningly.</p><p>"The less people know, the better," Agatha put the food in her mouth. Despite the high-quality ingredients, it tasted like cardboard, sitting uncomfortably on her tongue before she swallowed it with difficulty.</p><p>In truth, it didn't matter how much she told them. After admitting the marriage was fake, she had to count on them to keep up the lie - whether she shared only a fragment or every detail of the story. But she couldn't bring herself to retell every step of the process she had gone through to end up in this place, not when every word felt like a punch to her dignity.</p><p>To her surprise, Lilia merely nodded, slowly digging into her own food.</p><p>Jen didn't look pleased. "We're just letting her off the hook? With that non-answer?"</p><p>Lilia ignored her. "What's the plan now?" she asked calmly, cutting into her steak. "If you're against Evanora, you need a good one."</p><p>Agatha reached for her water to wash down the food sticking to the roof of her mouth. "We're meeting her in <em>Kestra</em> on Thursday to sell the story."</p><p>"How long have you been married?"</p><p>"Three weeks."</p><p>Lilia hummed. "And you haven't made any public appearances yet?"</p><p>Agatha scrunched her eyebrows at the question. "No?"</p><p>"You should," Jen cut in. "It'll look weird if you keep her in your house like a hostage."</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples. "I'm not keeping her hostage."</p><p>Jen pointed her fork at her. "Yeah? Then why does it look like you're hiding her?"</p><p>Agatha didn't have an immediate response to that, mostly because Jen had a point. She and Rio had slipped into a quiet routine - one that kept their interactions primarily confined to the house. Public appearances weren't a part of that equation.</p><p>Lilia chewed her food thoughtfully before setting the knife down. "If this is about optics, you need to control the narrative. If you want people to buy this marriage, you need to be seen together. Make it believable."</p><p>"The story is we've been dating for a year," Agatha reminded them. "It would look suspicious if we started flaunting it right after the marriage."</p><p>Jen tapped her fingers against her chin before shaking her head. "No, I don't think so. You didn't have eyes on you then."</p><p>"She's right," Lilia added. "Evanora was in the middle of losing a race for the past year; she probably didn't pay much attention to your life. But now? She <em>will</em>."</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw. She hated it when they ganged up on her, especially when they were <em>right</em>.</p><p>Jen smirked, sensing her irritation. "A dinner, maybe? A charity event? It has to be public enough to reach your mother."</p><p>"Preferably with people who know you, so the rumors spread faster," Lilia sipped her wine, deep in thought.</p><p>Then, Jen snapped her fingers, a victorious grin on her face. "The gala in two weeks!"</p><p>Agatha's hand froze in the air. The pasta slipped off the hovering fork and fell back on the plate with a wet splatter.</p><p>"No," she hissed, eyes darting between her friends. "Absolutely not."</p><p>"It's the perfect opportunity," Jen pointed out, glancing at Lilia. "Back me up?"</p><p>"It is. A work event always produces rumors faster than a glossy magazine."</p><p>The image of an immense yet stifling room, teeming with coworkers and clients, pressed in on her mind. The air would be thick with polite conversation, glasses clinking, and the weight of too many scrutinizing eyes. And beside her - Rio. Close enough that Agatha would feel the warmth radiating off her skin, possibly even touching her to sell the story as they accepted murmured congratulations on their marriage.</p><p>It sent a sharp twist of discomfort through her stomach.</p><p>"Just think about it," Jen urged, practically vibrating with excitement - far more than Agatha thought appropriate. "You always come alone to these events-"</p><p>"Because dragging anyone else along would be <em>cruel and unusual punishment</em>," Agatha interrupted, setting her fork down with a pointed clink. "<em>I </em>wouldn't even go if it weren't for Lilia's constant threats."</p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes, unimpressed. "You're a <em>partner</em>, Agatha. It's expected," she said, repeating the same line she had been drilling into her for the past five years. "And just like that, it's <em>expected</em> that you bring your spouse."</p><p>"But-"</p><p>"Rio isn't just some girl you're stringing along," Lilia pressed, her tone sharp, cutting through Agatha's rising agitation. "She's your <em>wife</em>. That means certain things are required of you. And the gala? It's the perfect opportunity to introduce your marriage to the world."</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth.</p><p>She should have been used to it by now - the words <em>wife, home, </em>and <em>Mrs. Harkness</em> had been tossed at her so relentlessly over the past three weeks that they should have lost all weight, worn down by Rio's relentless teasing. A part of her suspected that was Rio's plan: to desensitize her to the terms, make them familiar so she wouldn't flinch whenever she heard them.</p><p>It worked to a degree, but they still caught her off-guard sometimes, especially when someone other than Rio used them as freely as Lilia had.</p><p>"If that's not convincing enough," Jen raised her finger, pointing it at Agatha. "People in the office already know you're married because of yesterday. The gossip mill will spin out of control if you come alone."</p><p>Agatha made a mental note to yell at Rio again for breaking into her workplace.</p><p>She drummed her fingers against the table, mulling over the words. It made sense. Evanora would undoubtedly hear about the gala and possibly have one of her lapdogs attend it to spy on them. Showing up alone would give her an advantage, something to exploit in the long run, and Agatha didn't want to give her more ammunition.</p><p>She sighed, her jaw tightening. "Fine. I'll bring her."</p><p>Despite her surrender, Lilia still seemed unsatisfied. "You should also think about other outings. Regular dates, visiting each other at work, even shopping together, could cement the lie."</p><p>The idea made Agatha's eye twitch. Deep down, she realized their marriage couldn't be as low-profile as she would like, contained only to living together and wearing the rings on their fingers. It was a performance, an act meant for a broader audience, and her qualms about keeping her private life under wraps had no place in the equation.</p><p>Somehow, it didn't help that the marriage wasn't real, that it wasn't <em>actually</em> a part of her private life but a stack of legal documents and an infuriating woman haunting her house.</p><p>If anything, that made it worse.</p><p>Because it meant convincing everyone that she found someone to love her while distinctly aware that the marriage had a precise termination date.</p><p>While knowing that, at the end of the agreement, she would be alone.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Agatha silently cursed Lilia and her accurate observations.</p><p>"You don't even know what's at stake," she grumbled, realizing the silence had stretched for a beat too long. "Why are you invested?"</p><p>Lilia shrugged, a hint of a smile crinkling the corners of her eyes. "Watching Evanora lose is always a pleasure."</p><p>Something in her expression told Agatha that it wasn't the case, that her motivation ran deeper than Evanora's downfall.</p><p>Before she could question it, Jen spoke again, her voice tinged with amusement.</p><p>"So, are you wearing matching outfits?"</p><p>Agatha almost climbed over the table to strangle her.</p><hr/><p>After almost three hours of withstanding Lilia's inquisitive looks and fighting the urge to stab Jen with her fork, Agatha sighed in relief as she entered her house.</p><p>Even though her friends had, mercifully, dropped the topic of her marriage, the gala, and other possible outings after a while, the conversation had her spent. It was the first time she had shared the more nuanced logistics of the arrangement with someone other than her reflection - she had a habit of talking to herself, admittedly the only person in the world <em>worth</em> talking to - and the constructive criticism irked her.</p><p>The lie was fragile, she realized that, but Lilia and Jen picked it apart almost effortlessly, examining the details and pointing out flaws. Flaws that Agatha knew existed but refused to consider because of the actions fixing them would mean.</p><p>Now, she couldn't ignore them. She had to patch up the cracks before the entire construction crumbled, and she blamed, perhaps unfairly, Rio.</p><p>Rio, who couldn't wait until they were at the house to yell at her, who showed up at her work unannounced.</p><p>Rio, who materialized in the hall almost as if conjured.</p><p>"We have a problem."</p><p>
<em>If only one.</em>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged off her coat and tossed it on the rack without sparing Rio a glance.</p><p>"We do," she hissed, unlacing her shoes and placing them beside Rio's sneakers. "Thanks to your stunt, I had to spend three hours trapped in a room with Lilia and Jen."</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>Something in Rio's tone - low, clipped, <em>serious </em>- made Agatha look up. Her stomach tightened at the tension in the woman's face.</p><p>"<em>We have a</em> <em>problem</em>."</p><p>This time, the words landed right, threading a cold shiver down Agatha's spine. Her eyes flicked toward the staircase. Without another word, Rio gave a slow, deliberate shake of her head.</p><p>Agatha understood instantly, already moving toward the living room - the furthest they could get from Nicky's bedroom.</p><p>"Speak," she ordered as soon as they were safely out of earshot.</p><p>Rio dragged a hand through her hair, sinking onto the couch with a sigh as if she were choosing her words carefully. Finally, she met Agatha's gaze.</p><p>"Sharon asked me why Nicky calls me his mom's <em>friend</em> today."</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>The words settled over the room like a suffocating blanket, pressing down on her lungs. She had prepared for a lot of things - skepticism, scrutiny, the occasional raised brow from people who thought <em>she,</em> of all people, would never settle down - but not this.</p><p>Not fucking <em>Sharon</em>.</p><p>
<em>"What?!"</em>
</p><p>"I know," Rio exhaled, rubbing a hand across her face. "She said it in more words, but essentially, she thinks we're hiding our true selves from him."</p><p>Agatha blinked, once, twice, processing the information.</p><p>Deep down, she knew telling Nicky one version of the truth while everyone else got a different one was bound to backfire. The web of lies she and Rio had woven was fragile, delicate - one wrong step and the whole thing could shatter. She told herself she was keeping Nicky out of it for his own sake, shielding him from the complications of a situation even she struggled to grasp at times.</p><p>But the truth was far less noble.</p><p>Telling Nicky would cement the lie far more than if she shouted it for the entire world to hear. It would mean pretending to be Rio's wife in the house, outside of it, <em>everywhere.</em> It would make the situation even more confusing, more <em>complicated</em> than it already was.</p><p>So, she avoided it, hoping nobody would try to talk to Nicky about it, discouraged by his tight-lipped approach to Rio's presence at the house.</p><p>But Agatha had never been that lucky.</p><p>Lies had a way of unraveling, no matter how carefully spun.</p><p>And, of course, fucking <em>Sharon</em> created the first tear.</p><p>"Shit," she finally said, sitting in her favorite chair as her legs threatened to buckle under the revelation's weight. "What did you tell her?"</p><p>"A version of the truth," Rio's eyes locked onto hers, unwavering. "That he's still getting used to me, and we don't want to rush him."</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose. It was a good answer, a safe one, but that wasn't the problem.</p><p>The problem was that Sharon had <em>asked </em>in the first place.</p><p>"Do you think she'll try to talk to him about it?"</p><p>Rio hesitated, and her solemn expression unnerved Agatha more than the conversation itself. Rio's gravity stripped her of the illusion that they could sweep Sharon's words under the rug and keep Nicky in the dark. It spoke volumes about the severity of the situation and the need to handle it.</p><p>"She might. And if not her, then somebody else," Rio said slowly, her chest rising with a deep inhale. "It's a miracle we've gotten through three weeks without anybody bringing it up to him."</p><p>Agatha knew she was right, but the alternative to lying made blood freeze in her veins.</p><p>"We're not telling him," she warned before Rio could even say the words, her voice sharp and non-negotiable.</p><p>Rio worried her lower lip with her teeth, visibly conflicted. "I don't think we have a choice," she said gently.</p><p>Despite their softness, the words hit Agatha like a truck, making her recoil in the chair. She inhaled sharply, straightening her spine and pinning the woman under a hard look. "No, Rio."</p><p>"Agat-"</p><p>"<em>No</em>," she repeated more forcefully, keeping her voice low so it wouldn't travel through the house and up the stairs to Nicky's room. "I'm not dragging him into this."</p><p>"We have to say <em>something</em>," Rio argued. "You said we control the narrative; we need to contain this before somebody beats us to it."</p><p>Agatha's nostrils flared. "Don't use my words against me."</p><p>"They're the only words you'll listen to."</p><p>"How do you expect me to explain this to him?" Agatha demanded, her jaw tightening. "He's ten."</p><p>"We don't have to tell him about the deal," Rio said, sinking further into the cushions when Agatha's face twisted with rage.</p><p>"Oh, so you think it's best to tell him we're married for real?" she hissed, the idea as absurd as the situation itself.</p><p>Lying to everyone else was one thing.</p><p>Lying to <em>Nicky</em> was something else entirely.</p><p>Especially when it came to the way he <em>adored</em> Rio.</p><p>Rio sighed, rubbing the back of her neck, her frustration clear but measured. "Agatha, I know this isn't ideal, but he's going to find out one way or another. Even if <em>he</em> doesn't bring it up, what about Sharon? One of the teachers? <em>Your mother?</em>"</p><p>Agatha's eyes snapped to Rio's at the idea, her upper lip curled in a snarl. "She won't come near him."</p><p>The thought of Evanora hounding Nicky for information created a painful pit in her stomach, a black hole of dread threatening to suck her into the abyss. It hurt because she knew it was possible. She <em>knew</em> her mother could corner Nicky without her by his side, either by visiting the house when he was with Sharon or coming to his soccer practice.</p><p>And what was even worse - she knew Evanora was calculated and cruel enough to do it.</p><p>Rio's expression softened. "I hope so too, but we can't overlook it."</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tightening. She hated this. Hated that Rio had a point. Hated that she fooled herself into believing that she could keep the lie contained outside the walls of her home.</p><p>She could lie to the world, but Nicky?</p><p>"I just..." her voice was uncharacteristically small, a rare crack in her armor. "I don't want to confuse him."</p><p>Rio nodded as if she understood her hesitance, and it seemed worse than if she'd pressed harder. Sympathy was a sharp blade in Rio's hands, and Agatha had yet to learn how to block its blows.</p><p>"Then we make it simple," Rio said, shifting forward so her elbows rested on her knees. "We tell him we got married because we care about each other and make a good team."</p><p>Agatha scoffed, but it lacked the usual bite. "It's still a lie."</p><p>Rio's face remained stoic. "We're already lying to him," she noticed. "And this is as close to the truth as we can get without telling him everything."</p><p>It was dangerous, stupid, <em>wrong</em>. Agatha could think of a million ways it could backfire, including Nicky getting attached to Rio, only to see her move out in less than a year.</p><p>Still, they couldn't risk somebody blindsiding him with the revelation. It would not only threaten the arrangement but make him feel left out, omitted in an aspect that he should be the first to know about.</p><p>Besides, as reluctant as Agatha was to admit it, Nicky had <em>already</em> gotten attached to Rio, and she predicted it wouldn't matter if Rio stayed with them for two months or a year - Nicky would pout about her leaving all the same. Rio's relationship with his mother played a small role in the inevitable reluctance that would follow the woman's moving out.</p><p>Agatha wet her lips, sinking further into the chair. "We do make a good team when it comes to lying," she finally said, unwilling to dwell on the first part of Rio's sentence.</p><p>They didn't <em>care</em> about each other. The only thing holding them together was the money tied to their deal, but Nicky didn't have to know that. And they could pretend for his sake.</p><p>"Yeah," Rio watched her expectantly as if waiting for more.</p><p>Agatha drummed her fingers against the armrest, her gaze traveling the room to avoid the inquisitive eyes drilling holes into her face. "I'll talk to him today."</p><p>"Great," Rio relaxed on the couch, the tension seeping out of her muscles. Agatha realized the woman must have prepared for a longer match, a sharp back and forth that would undoubtedly transform into a hissing battle of wits, but she was too tired to argue after the conversation with Lilia and Jen.</p><p>Especially when she knew Rio was right.</p><p>Agatha <em>hated</em> it when other people were right.</p><p>The quiet agreement barely settled between them before she inhaled slowly, deciding to rip the band-aid off. The sooner she told Rio, the better.</p><p>"We'll have to be more public."</p><p>Rio's eyebrows shot up, her confusion immediate. "With?"</p><p>Agatha gestured between them, the ring on her finger catching the light like it wanted to offer Rio a clue. Not that she needed one.</p><p>"I have a work event in two weeks. We're going together."</p><p>Rio sat up straighter, suspicion flickering across her face. "Wait. You've yelled at me - four times, by the way - for showing up at your office. And now you want to make a public statement?"</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "You kept count?"</p><p>"You were loud. Hard to forget."</p><p>Agatha let the comment slide, exhaling through her nose. "Look, it wouldn't work in the long run," she admitted, ignoring the part of her that had - stupidly - hoped they could keep their arrangement quiet forever. Wishful thinking.</p><p>Rio's gaze sharpened. "You mean your mother wouldn't let it work."</p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened. "She's already making moves. We have to be one step ahead."</p><p>Rio studied her for a moment, unreadable. "Did she call again?"</p><p>"No," Agatha said. "Once was enough. She's watching, and we need to up our game."</p><p>"By parading our marriage in front of your coworkers?"</p><p>Agatha ignored the amusement laced in Rio's tone. "By making it look real. After the gala, we'll discuss other outings."</p><p>"Other outings?" Rio repeated, crossing her arms, a knowing smirk tugging at her lips. "Dates, you mean?"</p><p>Something uncomfortable settled low in Agatha's stomach at the word. <em>Dates</em>.</p><p>She hadn't framed it like that, hadn't even considered it. To her, these would be strategic appearances - planned, discussed, and executed with precision. A means to an end.</p><p>Without spontaneity, blurred lines, or room for mistakes. Just another clean-cut puzzle to finish the picture of their marriage in other people's eyes.</p><p>And yet, the word lingered, unsettling in a way she couldn't quite shake.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, shifting her weight. "As I said, we'll discuss it later," she fiddled with the rings adorning her fingers, purposefully avoiding touching the wedding band as if it might burn her on contact. "We have dinner with my mother first, then the gala. That should be enough for now."</p><p>Rio, unfortunately, wasn't done. She leaned in slightly, amusement dancing in her eyes. "So, do I get flowers?"</p><p>Agatha's head snapped up. "What?"</p><p>"For our date," Rio grinned, unbothered by the stunned silence stretching between them. Then, with a thoughtful tilt of her head, she added, "You're right, though. I should keep up the tradition of giving <em>you</em> flowers. Do you have favorites?"</p><p>"There's no <em>tradition</em>," Agatha snapped, begrudgingly recalling the bouquet Rio had gifted her for her birthday. The one that, despite her best efforts of conveniently forgetting to change the water, had lasted two whole weeks on the dinner table, proudly displayed and frequently admired by Sharon.</p><p>"There will be no flowers," she added, voice firm.</p><p>Rio pressed her tongue into her cheek, studying her with the kind of amusement that set Agatha's nerves on edge. "You look like you'd like azaleas."</p><p>Agatha groaned, dragging a hand down her face. "I hate you."</p><p>Rio chuckled, pushing off the couch with the confidence of someone who knew exactly what they were doing. "You'll love me by the time our third date rolls around."</p><p>Agatha glared at her retreating form, her pulse unsteady for reasons she refused to acknowledge.</p><p>Rio was having too much fun with this.</p><p>She shook off the unsettling feeling spreading across her chest and stood up, marching straight toward the stairs.</p><p>Putting off the conversation with Nicky was impossible now. The ground had already shifted beneath her feet, an earthquake set off by Sharon's question.</p><p>Knowing her neighbor, Agatha suspected she wouldn't last long without at least hinting at something she shouldn't. Sharon had probably already spread the news to anyone with functioning ears, and Agatha had to stop her before everyone and their dog knew.</p><p>So, with her heart in her throat, she knocked on Nicky's door and stepped inside after hearing his muffled "Come in."</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the bed, his small hands gripping his Nintendo Switch, his face scrunched in deep concentration.</p><p>"Hi, Mama," he muttered, not looking up.</p><p>Agatha closed the door behind her, her eyes instinctively flicking to the plant Rio had given him. It sat proudly on his desk, somehow thriving despite the controlled chaos of his room.</p><p>"The plant looks good," she noted, easing onto the edge of his bed.</p><p>"His name's Luci," Nicky corrected, still fixated on the screen. "Rio says it's 'cause I take special care of him."</p><p>Agatha exhaled softly. "I'm sure you do."</p><p>The silence stretched between them, interrupted only by the game's sound effects and Nicky's occasional grumbles. Agatha let it linger, choosing her next words carefully.</p><p>Eventually, she sighed, almost defeated.</p><p>"I wanted to talk to you about something," she watched him closely, but he only hummed in vague acknowledgment, too distracted to pick up on the weight in her voice. "It's important," she added, tapping his hand lightly - a wordless request to pause the game.</p><p>Nicky groaned. "I'm almost done, Mama. Can't it wait?"</p><p>It could - for the next five minutes it would probably take him to finish - but if she didn't say it now, she might never get the words out.</p><p>"It'll only take a minute, Nicholas."</p><p>The use of his full name did the trick. Nicky sighed dramatically but slapped the pause button, turning to her with cautious curiosity.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>Agatha smiled, though it felt stiff, forced. "You know how Rio's been living with us?"</p><p>Nicky's expression immediately turned suspicious. "She's not moving out already, right?"</p><p>"No, she's not," she assured him. She reached up to run a hand through her hair but stopped short, remembering it was still pulled into the tight bun she wore to work. The hand dropped uselessly into her lap as she inhaled slowly. "And you know how some people get married when they want to be a family?"</p><p>Nicky's eyes narrowed slightly, but he nodded.</p><p>"Well," Agatha swallowed against the tightness in her throat. "Rio and I got married."</p><p>His eyes widened slightly, the console nearly slipping from his grasp. "Oh."</p><p>Agatha shifted, tucking one leg beneath her to face him fully. "I wanted to tell you earlier, but I wanted to make sure you had time to get used to things first."</p><p>Nicky pressed his lips together, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>"So... you're together like Aunt Wanda and Uncle Vis?"</p><p>The question hung in the air. Agatha opened her mouth, searching for the right words - ones that weren't a lie but weren't the <em>whole</em> truth either.</p><p>Eventually, she nodded. "Kind of."</p><p>Nicky frowned. "But you don't act like them," his nose scrunched as if he were working through a puzzle. "They kiss and stuff."</p><p>Agatha made a mental note to yell at Wanda for unnecessary PDA in front of her son.</p><p>"Every family looks different, baby," she said carefully. "Some people get married because they fall in love, some because they want to take care of each other. Rio and I chose to get married because we wanted to be a team - to make sure we're all safe and happy."</p><p>Nicky tilted his head, still thinking. "So... you're like partners?"</p><p>The words hit something deep in Agatha's chest, but she forced a small nod. "Exactly. We're partners."</p><p>He considered it for a beat longer, then shrugged. "Okay."</p><p>"Okay?" Agatha repeated, unsure whether to be relieved or concerned.</p><p>"Okay," Nicky said again as if confirming it for himself.</p><p>Agatha waited for more - <em>anything</em> - but her son just blinked at her, his fingers idly tapping against the edge of his console.</p><p>"That's it?" she asked, unable to keep the disbelief from her voice.</p><p>Nicky shrugged. "Yeah. I mean, you already act like partners."</p><p>Agatha blinked. "We do?"</p><p>"Well, yeah," he wrinkled his nose as if she were the slowest person on the planet. "She cooks for us when you're busy. She helps with my math homework even though she makes a face the whole time. And she gives me the good cereal-"</p><p>"The cereal <em>I</em> buy."</p><p>"No, you buy the <em>healthy</em> cereal. Rio gives me hers when you're not looking," Nicky flinched, his eyes widening. "Don't tell Rio I told you."</p><p>Agatha suppressed a frown and made a mental note to throw out Rio's shitty cereal.</p><p>"And," Nicky continued hastily, hoping to distract her from the divulged secret. "You argue, like, all the time. But it's not your lawyer arguing, you know? It's like you're having fun, and sometimes you even laugh, so I know it's not serious."</p><p>Agatha stared at him, caught completely off guard. "I don't-"</p><p>"You do," he said simply. "So, yeah. You're partners. Makes sense you got married."</p><p>Her throat tightened.</p><p>This should have been easier. He had accepted it so readily, hadn't even questioned the <em>why </em>of it, and yet-</p><p>And yet, something about the way he said it, like it was obvious, like it was natural, sent an unfamiliar ache curling around her ribs.</p><p>Nicky didn't see a business arrangement. He saw a <em>team</em>.</p><p>And somehow, despite everything, Rio had become a part of that team in ways Agatha hadn't even noticed.</p><p>"...Okay," she murmured, brushing his hair back in a quiet, automatic gesture.</p><p>Nicky grinned, ducking away from her hand. "Can I go back to my game now?"</p><p>She huffed a laugh, shaking her head. "Yeah, go ahead."</p><p>"Cool," he said, already shifting back into position, eyes glued to the screen once more. But just before unpausing, he added, "Can Rio watch me more often since you're married? It was fun today."</p><p>Agatha barely flinched, her answer almost automatic. "Sure."</p><p>As she left the room, closing the door behind her, she exhaled a breath she hadn't realized she was holding.</p><p>She had expected this conversation to be difficult, to require a delicate balancing act of truth and omission.</p><p>She hadn't expected it to shake something loose inside her.</p><p>And she certainly hadn't expected <em>Rio</em> to already fit into their lives so seamlessly that her son - her observant, stubborn, impossibly clever son - had thought this marriage made perfect sense.</p><p>God help her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The week blurred into a frenzied haze, and before Agatha could brace herself for the inevitable, Thursday arrived in all its dooming glory.</p><p>They were as prepared as possible - their story was practiced, memorized, and rehearsed like a school play. Or, more accurately, a Broadway production, where even the slightest misstep could ruin the illusion. Without room for improvisation, for <em>error.</em></p><p>If they failed this first test, the rest of the year wouldn't matter. Their performance had to be sterling.</p><p>"You're going to break your fingers."</p><p>Rio's voice, gentle yet firm, cut through the tension hanging thick in the car.</p><p>Agatha blinked, glancing down. Her knuckles had gone white against the steering wheel, her fingers locked in a death grip. With effort, she forced herself to loosen them.</p><p>"We'll be fine."</p><p>The words felt hollow the moment they left Rio's lips, an empty promise neither could be sure would come true.</p><p>"We need to be better than fine," Agatha muttered, eyes glued to the road ahead. "We have to be <em>perfect</em>."</p><p>"And we will be."</p><p>Rio's unwavering confidence did nothing to settle the unease crawling under Agatha's skin.</p><p>Because Rio didn't know Evanora.</p><p>She didn't know how cunning, how merciless the woman could be in an interrogation - how effortlessly she wove traps, spun delicate webs of deceit, coaxing you forward until you were too tangled to escape.</p><p>Agatha had spent a <em>lifetime</em> preparing for this moment. She had studied her mother's tactics, learned to withstand her cutting remarks, and trained herself to recognize the invisible lines she dared others to cross.</p><p>And yet, even <em>she</em> sometimes fell into the snares.</p><p>Years of court battles, of staring down the best lawyers in the city and grinding them to dust beneath her heel - none of it compared to arguing with Evanora.</p><p>Her grip tightened again, the steering wheel creaking under the pressure.</p><p>"Agatha, seriously. You're going to hurt yourself."</p><p>Before she could loosen the hold or snap at the woman to mind her business, a warm hand settled on her wrist, just below her sleeve.</p><p>Skin on skin.</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, the touch more grounding than she wanted to admit.</p><p>They had talked about this - set the rules and defined the limits. What touches were necessary, and how far did they have to go to make this believable?</p><p>The conversation had been painful, mostly for Agatha.</p><p>She hadn't expected to feel so ridiculously exposed just discussing something as simple as hand-holding. But Rio had been infuriatingly at ease, watching her with barely concealed amusement as Agatha struggled to answer questions that should have been straightforward.</p><p>What counted as a natural display of affection? Would touching her arm be normal? A hand on her back? Sitting close together?</p><p>It was <em>absurd.</em> They were <em>adults</em>, not teenagers, stepping into their first relationship. It shouldn't have been difficult.</p><p>And yet, every hypothetical situation had made Agatha uncomfortable in ways she didn't have the patience to analyze. Not because of the idea itself, but because picturing it - picturing Rio touching her, standing too close, leaning in with easy familiarity - felt entirely too real.</p><p>She had rushed through the conversation, spitting out answers in clipped tones, desperate to move on before she embarrassed herself further. But Rio had taken her time, pushing just enough to get under Agatha's skin, like she found every inch of her discomfort entertaining.</p><p>And now, here they were.</p><p>Rio's palm rested against her wrist, warm, steady, grounding - just as they had discussed, just as they had agreed would be normal.</p><p>So why the hell did it feel anything but?</p><p>Agatha found the answer simmering on the tip of her tongue and didn't bother to hold it back. "Keep your hands to yourself until we're in public."</p><p>Despite the warning in her voice, Rio's fingers lingered. A deliberate pause, a fraction too long - just to make Agatha notice.</p><p>Then, finally, they slipped away.</p><p>"Whatever you want, sweetheart."</p><p>Agatha's grip on the wheel tightened again. She turned, glaring at Rio from the corner of her eye. "Do you want to get out of this car alive?"</p><p>Rio only laughed, drumming her fingers lazily against the door. "Am I that distracting?"</p><p>
<em>Yes.</em>
</p><p>"We should've worked on that," Rio mused.</p><p>Agatha scowled. "On you being distracting?"</p><p>"On you not flinching every time I touch you. Or use a pet name."</p><p>The words settled between them, heavier than Rio's tone suggested.</p><p>For a moment, too brief, too fleeting, Agatha saw it.</p><p>Sitting on the couch, book in hand, while Rio played absently with the loose strands of her hair. Gentle fingertips grazing her skin, slow and thoughtless, mapping out the uncovered space like she had every right to.</p><p>She imagined sighing at the touch, leaning into it, letting it soothe her instead of setting her on edge.</p><p>The image vanished as quickly as it came, leaving something unsettled in its place.</p><p>"Sweetheart is a shitty pet name," Agatha grumbled. "You're not a sixty-year-old lunch lady."</p><p>"Okay, <em>snookums.</em>"</p><p>A growl formed at the back of Agatha's throat, low and threatening.</p><p>Rio, the menace that she was, only grinned. "Sweetcheeks? Pookie? Lovebug?"</p><p>Agatha's jaw twitched as she exhaled slowly, struggling to hold on to her fleeting patience. "I'm reconsidering this entire ordeal."</p><p>Rio's smirk only widened. She saw the crack in Agatha's resolve, and like any good opportunist, she dug in.</p><p>"Ah, come on, muffin, don't break my heart like that," she sighed, full of mock despair as if Agatha was the one being insufferable. "Honeybun? Boo thang?"</p><p>The bark of laughter that escaped against her will was less than dignified. A betrayal.</p><p>She bit her lip, trying to shove it back down, but the damage was done. Her shoulders shook with barely restrained giggles, her grip on the wheel finally loosening.</p><p>"Boo thang?" she wheezed, completely losing the battle. "Have you ever met a woman who actually wanted to be called that?"</p><p>"Not yet," Rio said, completely unbothered, leaning back in her seat. "But I like to think of myself as a trendsetter."</p><p>Agatha shook her head, still laughing despite herself.</p><p>This woman was <em>unbearable</em>.</p><p>Worse?</p><p>
<em>She liked it.</em>
</p><p>"Well, I'm vetoing boo thang," she mused, dragging out the last word with deliberate disdain. "And everything else you used. Some of those should be illegal."</p><p>"Your wish is my command, <em>gorgeous</em>."</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Yeah, she could get behind that one.</p><p>It was stupid how easily the word slid out of Rio's mouth, effortless and smooth, like it belonged there.</p><p>Agatha's brain stuttered for half a second too long, and before she could school her reaction, warmth crawled up her neck, settling on her cheeks.</p><p>Rio saw it immediately.</p><p>Her grin slowly stretched, sharp and self-satisfied, pure Cheshire Cat levels of smugness.</p><p>"Looks like we have our winner."</p><p>Agatha scowled, hating how weak her voice sounded when she muttered, "Shut up."</p><p>It lacked bite, venom, <em>anything</em> that would make Rio stop grinning like that.</p><p>So, of course, she didn't.</p><p>Instead, she leaned in just a fraction, left arm casually slung over the back of Agatha's seat, studying her with that infuriating amusement, like she had all the time in the world to watch her squirm.</p><p>"Say the word, gorgeous," Rio drawled. "And I'll never call you anything else."</p><p>Agatha refused to look at her.</p><p>Because if she did, she had a feeling she'd lose her dignity, her self-control, <em>herself</em>.</p><p>Thankfully, before Rio could test her patience even further, the restaurant's entrance came into view like a lifeline.</p><p>Agatha barely let the car roll to a stop before she practically threw herself out of it, yanking the keys from the ignition and striding toward the valet.</p><p>"Miss Harkness," the man greeted her with a polite nod, hand outstretched.</p><p>Rio materialized beside her a second later - too close, too casual, too damn pleased with herself.</p><p>"It's <em>Mrs</em>. Harkness, actually," she corrected the valet with an easy smile.</p><p>Agatha fought the instinct to flinch when a warm hand settled around her waist - a clear reminder of the roles they had to play.</p><p>Her body went stiff at the touch, but she refused to let it show. Not here, not now.</p><p>To his credit, the valet barely blinked at the gesture. He caught the car keys as they slipped from Agatha's frozen hand, the motion smooth and professional.</p><p>"My apologies, ma'am," he said softly, his voice polite but detached as he motioned toward the entrance. "My colleague inside will take care of you from here."</p><p>Rio nodded appreciatively, sending the man a charming smile.</p><p>"Wonderful, thank you!" the hand on Agatha's waist tightened, urging her forward.</p><p>Agatha's muscles tensed at the pressure, but she didn't pull away. She couldn't, not in front of the valet, not with the scene they had to sell. So, she allowed Rio to guide her, even as her body screamed to break free of the touch.</p><p>"Relax," Rio's voice was low, almost teasing as she leaned in just enough for Agatha to hear, the warmth of her breath sending an involuntary shiver down Agatha's spine. "We've got this."</p><p>If it were anyone else, Agatha might have snapped, but Rio's words were a quiet, disarming reminder of the stakes. They had to keep up appearances if this was going to work.</p><p>She took a steadying breath, forcing her muscles to relax into the touch as the door opened for them. The air felt cooler inside, the soft hum of chatter and the clink of glasses creating a layer of noise that made it easier to pretend. The maître d' looked up, and a polite smile stretched his lips.</p><p>"Right this way, Mrs. and Mrs. Harkness," the man said, the titles falling easily from his lips as if he had been addressing married couples like them for years.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to protest - after all, they hadn't changed their names - but Rio's fingers dug into her side, stopping her.</p><p>"Doesn't matter," Rio whispered, pulling her to follow him to their table.</p><p>Agatha swallowed her annoyance, allowing herself to be led through the upscale restaurant.</p><p>In another lifetime, she might have paused to admire the sweeping sea view beyond the grand windows, the way the golden light reflected off pristine white tablecloths and sleek gray marble. She could have appreciated the intentional decadence, the quiet hum of wealth and power woven into every polished surface.</p><p>But not in this lifetime.</p><p>Here, the air was thick with ghosts - dinners where she sat stone-still beneath Evanora's scrutiny, her mother's sharp gaze cutting through her like a scalpel. Every detail had been a reason to tear her apart - her clothes, her order, her posture, her life.</p><p>Even now, stepping into this space felt like stepping back into a battlefield.</p><p>"Your mother has already arrived, but she had to step out for a minute," the maître d' informed her as they reached the usual table.</p><p>The ghosts in Agatha's mind screamed like banshees.</p><p>
<em>Step out.</em>
</p><p>More likely, Evanora had orchestrated this deliberate absence, giving Agatha a moment to stew, to sit in the familiar trap and feel the walls closing in before she even arrived.</p><p>"May I?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes snapped to the man, her mind jolting back to the present. He was waiting, hands outstretched, for her coat.</p><p>She exhaled through her nose and shrugged it off in a smooth, mechanical motion, watching Rio do the same.</p><p>"I will be right back with your meals."</p><p>Agatha merely hummed in acknowledgment as she slid stiffly into the plush chair, her spine locked straight as a blade. She could see her mother already, seated across from her, posture flawless, gaze razor-sharp, lips curved into that signature arch of wordless disapproval.</p><p>A phantom presence, a shadow that never left.</p><p>Rio settled beside her, her attention drifting across the lavish interior, eyes sparkling with silent awe.</p><p>"Is this place so fancy they read your mind?" she mused. "We haven't even looked at the menu yet."</p><p>Agatha's scowl deepened.</p><p>"My mother ordered for us," she said, voice tight as she glanced toward the entrance.</p><p>Still no Evanora.</p><p>"You okay?"</p><p>A thumb brushed against the back of her hand, making her realize she had been gripping the table's edge as if afraid it would float away.</p><p>That grounding sensation from the car returned, spreading through her like a slow burn. A quiet warmth, insistently pressing back against the creeping chill inside her. A tether.</p><p>Her breath caught, eyes snapping to Rio's.</p><p>The raw concern in those deep brown irises unnerved her more than her mother's absence.</p><p>Her lips parted, an easy lie already forming - something dismissive, something sharp, something to make Rio back off.</p><p>But the words never made it out.</p><p>Instead, she let out an unsteady breath.</p><p>"I just want to get this over with," she admitted, voice quieter than she intended - almost shy.</p><p>Rio's expression softened even further, her hand settling fully over Agatha's, the warmth no longer fleeting but solid and steady. A touch that didn't demand but offered.</p><p>"We'll be okay," Rio whispered, her gaze locked onto hers. "Just tell me if it becomes too much, okay? We can leave whenever you want."</p><p>Under any other circumstances, Agatha would've clenched her teeth, stifling the vulnerability blooming in her chest. She would've snatched her hand away, probably hissing at Rio to stop being so soft, so understanding, so <em>warm.</em></p><p>Because warmth was dangerous, it made her want to lean into it, let it melt her frozen shell, and let Rio <em>see</em>.</p><p>But these weren't normal circumstances. And for reasons she couldn't untangle, she didn't pull away.</p><p>Instead, she turned her hand, lacing their fingers together on the pristine white tablecloth - a silent agreement, a fragile surrender.</p><p>Rio gave her a small, reassuring squeeze, and somehow, in the opulent battlefield of her mother's choosing, that simple gesture felt like armor.</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>The sharp tone cut through the softness of the moment like a knife, making her instinctively flinch away from Rio, like a child caught with their hand in the cookie jar.</p><p>The warmth evaporated from her body the second she met Evanora's eyes - steely, calculated, unforgiving.</p><p>The same eyes people always said they shared.</p><p>God, how she hated those eyes.</p><p>"Mother," she greeted, pleased to find her voice steady despite the ice settling in her veins.</p><p>Let the game begin.</p><p>Agatha rose, spine straight, chin high - the picture of composure she had spent years perfecting.</p><p>"This is my wife, Rio."</p><p>Evanora's mouth barely tightened, but the faint flicker of disdain in her gaze was enough. Unbothered, Rio pushed back her chair and stood, her posture relaxed, a polite, easy smile curling her lips.</p><p>"Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Harkness," she said brightly, extending a hand.</p><p>Evanora didn't move.</p><p>"<em>Senator</em>," she corrected, the single word carrying enough venom to corrode steel.</p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened, a silent warning aimed at Rio, but the woman was already tilting her head, studying Evanora with something dark and unreadable gleaming in her eyes.</p><p>"Oh," Rio muttered in surprise, too overzealous to be genuine, letting her hand drop. "I thought you lost the last election. My apologies, I must've read that wrong."</p><p>The tension cracked, stretching and coiling like a snake readying for attack.</p><p>Agatha barely kept her expression neutral, though inside, a flicker of admiration warred with exasperation. Rio was playing with fire - dangerous, unforgiving fire.</p><p>Evanora's lips pressed together, her jaw tightening just enough for Agatha to recognize it as a restrained reaction. To anyone else, she might have appeared unaffected, but Agatha had spent years decoding the subtle shifts in her mother's mask.</p><p>"How charming," Evanora finally said, voice smooth but laced with steel. She turned her gaze back to Agatha, dismissing Rio without another glance. "I see you've made some... interesting choices, as always."</p><p>Rio whistled softly, so low that only Agatha caught it.</p><p>"Damn," she muttered under her breath, just loud enough to poke at Evanora's composure. "Didn't think I'd need that coat back so soon, but I swear it just got colder in here."</p><p>Agatha swallowed a sigh and shot Rio a look, one she hoped conveyed, <em>for the love of God, behave. </em>Rio merely quirked a brow, a picture of innocence.</p><p>"Shall we sit?" Agatha suggested, cutting through the tension before it thickened further. She gestured toward the table, forcing her voice into its usual cool detachment. "I'm sure we have a lot to discuss."</p><p>Evanora's eyes flickered between them before she gracefully lowered herself into her seat.</p><p>"Yes," she murmured, watching them settle back into their chairs with an unreadable expression. "We clearly do."</p><p>Let the game begin, indeed.</p><p>A waiter approached with their food, and Agatha clenched her jaw as he wordlessly brought a salad to her.</p><p>The unspoken insult settled like a stone in her stomach as she stared at the meal meant to remind her, to put her back in her place.</p><p>The same way it always had.</p><p>"I took the liberty of ordering for you," Evanora said smoothly as if it was an act of kindness and not a planned move to make Agatha's composure waver.</p><p>The waiter disappeared, chased away by a dismissive flick of Evanora's wrist, but Agatha could not look away from the salad.</p><p>From the crisp leaves and delicate vinaigrette. From the sparse chunks of cheese and the abnormal amount of tomatoes.</p><p>It wasn't just food; it was a symbol of control, of expectations, of the suffocating way Evanora always tried to shape her.</p><p>The carefully crafted, calorie-conscious meal was a subtle jab, but it was one Agatha had endured countless times before. She could practically hear her mother's voice in her head, telling her that this was for her own good.</p><p>Her stomach lurched, but as she reached for a fork, Rio's voice cut through the thick tension, smooth as silk. "That's very kind."</p><p>It was a simple sentence, but the weight behind it was undeniable. The <em>understanding</em>, the way Rio had already pieced together the puzzle.</p><p>Before Agatha could react, Rio took action.</p><p>With effortless grace, she picked up her own plate with a glorious heap of creamy pasta with shrimp, the kind of dish meant to remind one of indulgence, of freedom.</p><p>And then, in one swift, deliberate move, she swapped their plates.</p><p>"But I fear I'm not a fan of shrimp."</p><p>It was a lie, Agatha realized. She had seen Rio devour shrimp-laden pasta more times than she could count, her eyes lighting up with satisfaction at every bite. If anything, Evanora had unknowingly chosen the perfect meal for Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened as a sudden, undeniable warmth flooded her when she met Rio’s gaze. It was the warmth of something she hadn't felt in a long time: solidarity. It was a defiant unity, a shared understanding that transcended the arrangement.</p><p>Evanora's reaction was almost imperceptible, but Agatha caught it. Her eyes flickered with the faintest flash of disbelief, a sharp intake of breath, and then the tiniest widening of pupils. She had never been defied like this, certainly not by someone like <em>Rio</em>. To have someone like that refuse to be cowed, to refuse to bow to her will, was an anomaly. It was almost enough for Evanora to lose her composure.</p><p>But Rio was already digging into the salad, her expression unbothered as if she hadn't just flipped the script to defy the most powerful woman at the table.</p><p>Agatha didn't even care that Rio was eating the insulting dish with genuine enjoyment. It wasn't about the food anymore, but the act itself - about standing in solidarity when she needed it most. And that was far more revolutionary than what most people did when faced with Evanora's power.</p><p>Emboldened by Rio's casual defiance, she reached for her fork, swirling it in the pasta before meeting her mother's gaze head-on.</p><p>"I assume you didn't invite us here for pleasantries," she said, her tone measured. "Let's skip the theatrics, shall we?"</p><p>Evanora's lips curled into something resembling amusement, though her eyes remained sharp. "Always so impatient," she sighed, smoothing out the napkin in her lap.</p><p>"I wouldn't want to waste your precious time," Agatha shot back, raising the fork to her mouth. "I'm sure you have better things to do than interrogating me and my wife."</p><p>The word had the desired effect as Evanora's jaw ticked in annoyance.</p><p>"Very well," her mother folded her hands on the table, her manicured nails tapping once against the linen before she spoke again. "Let's hear what lies you have prepared for me."</p><p>Agatha didn't blink. "Lies?"</p><p>Evanora tilted her head slightly, studying her like a predator sizing up its prey. "Oh, Agatha," she murmured, voice laced with false sympathy. "Did you really think I wouldn't notice how... <em>convenient </em>this little arrangement is?"</p><p>Agatha forced herself to hold her mother's gaze, refusing to let the words unnerve her. "I don't know what you're insinuating."</p><p>Rio, to her credit, played her part perfectly. She placed a hand over Agatha's, her thumb stroking the back of it in a way that looked effortless - affectionate, even.</p><p>Evanora's lips twitched at the display, but the frown quickly transformed into a smirk. "Oh, darling, I don't insinuate; I observe."</p><p>Unhurriedly, she dug her fork into her salad, letting the words gain weight as she chewed.</p><p>"For instance," she continued smoothly. "It's curious that your so-called relationship was nonexistent until it wasn't. No hints, no whispers, not even a single public appearance. And then, out of nowhere, you're married?" her brow lifted.</p><p>Agatha clenched her fork, already gearing up for a sharp retort – something about Evanora not paying enough attention to her life to realize she’d been dating someone - but Rio was faster.</p><p>"Agatha's always been private about personal matters," she said calmly. "I’m sure being a public figure makes you appreciate privacy more than most, Mrs. Harkness. You should know some things aren’t meant for a broader audience."</p><p>Evanora hummed, unconvinced but momentarily thrown off course by the directness of the words.</p><p>Agatha seized the opening. "Mother, if you want to come out and accuse me of something, please do. Otherwise, I'd rather enjoy my meal without baseless theories about my life."</p><p>Evanora smiled, cold and detached as she raised her shoulders in a small shrug. "I didn't come here to accuse anyone," she tilted her head, eyes focused on Agatha. "But a marriage? What a bold step for someone who's never believed in commitment."</p><p>Agatha didn't flinch. "People change."</p><p>"Do they?" Evanora countered smoothly. "I always thought love was supposed to soften people. Yet, here you are, as combative as ever."</p><p>Agatha bit back a remark about how little her mother could know about love - an old crone, incapable of loving even her own daughter.</p><p>"I wasn't aware love required submission," she said instead, putting down her fork.</p><p>"It requires something," Evanora murmured, taking a slow sip of wine before shifting her gaze to Rio. "Tell me, dear, do you find my daughter's sharp edges charming or exhausting?"</p><p>Rio barely hesitated, offering a small, easy smile. "A bit of both."</p><p>Agatha shot her a look, but Rio continued without missing a beat. "But I knew what I was signing up for. And I wouldn't change a thing."</p><p>"How romantic," Evanora said, voice smooth but laced with skepticism. "I must say, this all feels so... <em>sudden</em>. How long have you two been together?"</p><p>"A little over a year," the practiced answer rolled off Agatha's tongue effortlessly.</p><p>Evanora turned back to her, eyebrow raised. "A year? You haven't mentioned a relationship once."</p><p>"You don't ask about my life," Agatha pointed out. "Hard to bring something up when you never show interest."</p><p>Evanora made a quiet, amused sound. "Oh, I'm interested now."</p><p>Agatha forced a smirk. "So I've noticed."</p><p>"It's funny," Evanora chuckled, shaking her head as if amused by Agatha's audacity. "I always assumed that if you ever settled down, it would be with someone... well, let's say, <em>accustomed</em> to handling difficult people."</p><p>Agatha stiffened, fingers tightening around Rio's.</p><p>Rio's expression didn't change, but the shift in her posture was unmistakable. Her muscles tightened, shoulders squaring up as if she were getting ready to climb over the table and stab her mother-in-law with her fork.</p><p>"Difficult?" she repeated, her tone mild but with an unmistakable edge.</p><p>Evanora waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, come now. Apparently, you've known my daughter long enough to realize she can be a handful. Stubborn. Controlling. And, if I recall correctly, not particularly adept at forming long-term attachments."</p><p>Agatha felt her stomach tighten, but she didn't let it show. This was Evanora's favorite game - finding the old scars and forcefully splitting them open until they bled again.</p><p>"Not very <em>likable</em> either," Evanora continued, sounding almost defeated. "Which makes me wonder," her gaze slid back to Rio, her lips curving in something meant to resemble a smile. "Why <em>her</em>?"</p><p>The implication hung in the air like poison.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, heat creeping up her neck. She didn't need to hear the rest of that sentence to know exactly where her mother was going.</p><p>Why would <em>anyone</em> choose her?</p><p>Before she could formulate a response, Rio laughed - <em>actually</em> laughed. The sound was light, dispersing the dark cloud hanging over the table. "You make it sound like being with Agatha is a burden."</p><p>Evanora arched a brow. "Isn't it?"</p><p>"Not to me," Rio said smoothly, her fingers tightening around Agatha's. "I happen to like her sharp edges. I respect them."</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, not expecting the way those words settled in her chest, warm and steady.</p><p>"Respect is a lovely sentiment," Evanora chewed thoughtfully on another forkful of lettuce. "But do you understand what you've gotten yourself into? Agatha, well, she's never been easy."</p><p>Rio's smile sharpened. "I don't want <em>easy</em>. Easy gets tedious after the novelty has worn off."</p><p>Evanora leaned back in her chair, tapping her fingers against her wine glass, her gaze flickering between the two women.</p><p>"And handling her moods doesn't?" she asked coolly as though testing Rio's resolve. "You don't find it exhausting, being in a relationship where one side is perpetually distant?"</p><p>Agatha's stomach twisted at the insinuation, but she kept her expression composed, refusing to show the crack of vulnerability Evanora had just exposed. It was a game of manipulation, invented and perfected by her mother.</p><p>Rio squeezed Agatha's hand just enough to remind her that she wasn't alone. "See, that's your problem," she said evenly, making Evanora's brows jump. "You see something exhausting, but I see a challenge. The <em>distance</em> you're talking about isn't an impassable obstacle, it's a part of who she is. And I'm not afraid of it."</p><p>Evanora's lips pressed into a thin line, a hint of a sneer on the edge of her smile. "Oh? You've been together for a year, I'm sure you've heard about her other... flings. What makes you think you're the one to last? The one to pass the obstacle?"</p><p>"I'm not a fling. I'm her <em>wife</em>," Rio replied coolly, her eyes unwavering as she met Evanora's gaze. The calm confidence in her voice carried a weight impossible to ignore, but Evanora remained unbothered.</p><p>"A wife," she repeated as if testing the word on her tongue. "Only a year and you have already earned that title. Makes one think there weren't many other options, not many others able to handle her."</p><p>"Not everybody likes a challenge."</p><p>"Is that what this is?" Evanora tilted her head. "You sign up for a lifetime of her moods, her distance, and her inability to let anyone in for a <em>challenge</em>?"</p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, her voice laced with warning. "We've already established I'm not looking for easy. Do you see this as a test? A game where the prize is a perfect relationship with no issues?" she shook her head. "It's not. What I've signed up for is the woman sitting beside me, with all her strength, her imperfections, and yes, her distance. But you know what? I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere."</p><p>Agatha felt a surge of something she couldn't quite name - pride, relief, maybe even something more profound. Rio was defending her. Genuinely defending her, not with a simple rebuttal or dismissive remarks, but with an unshakable certainty.</p><p>For a moment, she forgot it was a ploy, that Rio's words didn't carry the weight her tone suggested, that she <em>would</em> eventually leave. It seemed impossible with the steely conviction edged into Rio’s voice and the weight of her hand pressing into Agatha’s. With the clear annoyance hidden under her cool mask, as if Evanora’s attempts at tearing Agatha down did nothing but enrage Rio.</p><p>Evanora's eyes narrowed, her hands resting on the table's edge, fingers tapping softly against the white linen as she processed the words.</p><p>Finally, her lips stretched in a slow, calculated smile.</p><p>"Well, I've always enjoyed a challenge too," she said, her voice low and honeyed. "This... this will be interesting to watch. You think you're immune to the messiness of it all, but even the most determined people eventually lose their interest."</p><p>Agatha's chest tightened, the sting of the words settling deep as her mother twisted another knife to make her feel like she wasn't quite enough.</p><p>"I'm not afraid of the mess," Rio leaned back slightly, her tone softening just a fraction but still steady. "What's love without getting your hands dirty?"</p><p>The silence that followed felt thick, suffocating. Evanora didn't say a word, her lips pressing tightly together, her gaze colder than before. For a moment, Agatha thought she might say something sharp - lose her composure - but instead, Evanora merely picked up her glass, swirling the wine slowly as though considering her next words.</p><p>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, she put the glass down, her gaze fixed on Agatha.</p><p>"You've always been a disappointment," she said, her voice heavy with years of bitterness. "You know that, right?"</p><p>The words hit Agatha like a slap, and for a second, she couldn't breathe. All the old wounds, all the years of trying to be enough for her mother, came crashing back. The ghosts of not just the conversations held in the restaurant but everywhere else - her childhood home, various events, rides to school - screamed around her, their voices blending into an anguished choir.</p><p>She felt Rio's hand tighten almost painfully around her fingers, the pressure serving as a tether keeping her from surrendering to the ghosts' cries.</p><p>Then, Rio moved, her face twisting in a scowl that made her look almost feral, ready to leap over the table and squeeze the life out of Evanora with her bare hands.</p><p>Before she could do something neither could undo, Agatha squeezed her fingers back in a silent plea to stay civil, and straightened her spine.</p><p>The screams were familiar, bringing a sharp sting of never being what Evanora wanted her to be.</p><p>But this time, they didn't sting quite as badly.</p><p>"Maybe I've never been what you wanted," she said, her voice quiet but steady. "But I'm enough for myself. And for her."</p><p>Something akin to disdain flashed in Evanora's eyes, but she said nothing further. Instead, she turned her attention back to her salad, methodically gathering the ingredients on her fork as though she were done with the conversation.</p><p>The grip on Agatha's hand loosened, and she instinctively clenched her fingers around Rio's, afraid she would pull away. She sighed softly when a gentle thumb ran along hers in a wordless promise.</p><p>There were no grand victories here, no triumphant final words, but something had shifted. For once, she had stood her ground. And for once, her mother's words didn't make her crumble.</p><p>Evanora leaned back in her chair, her expression calculating. "I do wonder how this... marriage will progress," she mused, her voice now distant as if the conversation was over for her. "I suppose I will see."</p><p>Agatha recognized the thinly veiled threat but didn't respond. She knew Evanora would be watching them, searching for clues to build her case and discredit their relationship, especially after the tense conversation.</p><p>But it was a problem for another time. For now, all that mattered was that they had survived the first battle.</p><hr/><p>The rest of the dinner passed in tense, charged silence, the air between them thick enough to choke on. They finished their meals without bothering to engage, each bite a battle of wills rather than an act of necessity.</p><p>Evanora's expression remained impassive, but her eyes, cold and assessing, lingered on their joined hands, on the way Rio had gravitated toward Agatha, close enough for their shoulders to nearly brush. The occasional flicker of disgust visible in the sharp twitch of her brows and the faint downturn of her lips was enough for Agatha to know her mother was bothered.</p><p>Good.</p><p>She leaned into Rio's touches, allowing them to linger just a second longer than necessary, relishing the subtle tells of discomfort as they needled at her mother's composure.</p><p>Still, Evanora said nothing. Not in public, where the wrong tone or a misplaced word could draw attention she had no interest in attracting. Her silence, however, was razor-sharp, brimming with all the words she couldn't say but Agatha could easily guess. Eventually, she finished her meal, snapping at the waiter when he inquired about dessert and rising from her chair with a clipped farewell.</p><p>She didn't wait for them, didn't so much as glance back as she strode out, stiff-backed and seething.</p><p>Agatha watched her go, finally letting her muscles relax as she picked up her glass.</p><p>"So," she murmured, taking a slow sip of water, "that went well."</p><p>Rio hummed around the mouthful of lettuce she was chewing. "I stand by my first judgment," she said after swallowing, making Agatha look at her in surprise. "She <em>is</em> a bitch."</p><p>Agatha chuckled, putting down her glass and leaning back in her chair. "I'd say you get used to it, but..." she shrugged, eyes lingering on the exit before moving back to Rio, who was fitting another leaf into her mouth. "You don't have to keep eating that."</p><p>The unsaid words lingered between them.</p><p>
<em>You didn't have to do that.</em>
</p><p>Rio made a quiet sound of acknowledgment, putting her fork on the almost empty plate and pushing it back. "Honestly, you'd think a restaurant like this would splurge on something other than lettuce," she said good-naturedly, reaching for her water. "But I could tell it was <em>expensive </em>lettuce, you know? The fanciest I've ever tasted."</p><p>Agatha smiled, but the gesture didn't reach her eyes. "The salad normally has more cheese and croutons."</p><p>"A bitch indeed," Rio muttered, so low Agatha wasn't sure she was even supposed to hear it.</p><p>She ignored the irritation woven into Rio's voice as if she was genuinely angry at Evanora for the stunt and turned to attract the waiter's attention. With her mother gone, there was no point in staying at the haunted restaurant.</p><p>Almost reluctantly, Agatha untangled their hands to reach for the check.</p><p>"Don't tell me you'll also have to pay for that heap of lettuce," Rio grumbled as her eyes swept over the sum, widening slightly. "What the <em>fuck</em>."</p><p>Agatha bumped her knee against the woman's under the table to silence her and handed the waiter her card. "That will be all."</p><p>The man nodded, his eyes flickering between them. "I'll be right back."</p><p>Rio sighed dramatically, slumping in her chair. "For that price, he should return with a commemorative plaque saying 'Survived dinner with Evanora Harkness'. Etched in gold."</p><p>Agatha snorted, rubbing her temples. "I don't think my house is big enough to fit one of those after every dinner with her."</p><p>"Do you have to go through this often?" Rio nodded toward Evanora's empty seat, her expression softening.</p><p>"Not anymore," Agatha pursed her lips, drumming her fingers against the table. "She used to insist on seeing me at least once a week after I moved out and started college. But, eventually, she realized the older I got, the less power she had over me and my decisions, so she gave up."</p><p>Rio hummed, tilting her head as she studied Agatha. "Gave up, or just got more creative with her tactics?"</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, a humorless smirk tugging at her lips. "You catch on fast."</p><p>"She doesn't seem like the type to just 'give up'."</p><p>Agatha couldn't disagree. Evanora had always been strategic in her cruelty - never direct, never reckless. If she wasn't pulling the strings, she was waiting in the wings, ready to strike when the moment was right.</p><p>"She's not," Agatha crossed her arms, leaning back in her chair. "Evanora will try everything to prove she's right, no matter how many bridges she'll have to burn or how many people she'll hurt in the process. The only thing that matters is the finish line."</p><p>"How Machiavellian," Rio sipped on her water, expression thoughtful. "I can't imagine growing up with someone like that."</p><p>Agatha shrugged, pausing the conversation as the waiter approached again.</p><p>"Thank you, Mrs. Harkness. Have a wonderful evening."</p><p>Rio muttered something under her breath that sounded suspiciously like <em>highway robbery</em> as Agatha tucked the card away.</p><p>"It's just who she is," she continued, sliding her chair back.</p><p>"That doesn't make it okay."</p><p>Agatha didn't have an answer for that.</p><p>Rio sighed, threading her arms through her coat's sleeves and reaching for Agatha's hand as if it were the most natural thing in the world. "Let's go. Before they charge you for breathing."</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, letting herself be led to the exit.</p><p>To her surprise, once they reached the valet, Rio snatched the keys out of his hand before Agatha could.</p><p>"What exactly are you doing?" she asked, her voice low as they walked to the car.</p><p>Rio grinned, opening the passenger door for her to get in. "The evening's still young, and I don't know about you, but I could use a drink."</p><p>Agatha hesitated, narrowing her eyes as she slid into the seat. "And where exactly are you planning to take me?"</p><p>Rio shut the door and rounded the car, slipping into the driver's seat with a smirk. "Relax, <em>wifey</em>," she teased, adjusting the mirrors like she hadn't just hijacked Agatha's car. "It's just a drink. I think we both deserve one after that circus act."</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, leaning back against the headrest as Rio started the engine. "I don't need a drink."</p><p>"Well, I do," Rio countered, expertly pulling out of the parking lot. "And you're mine for the evening, so..."</p><p>Agatha ignored the spark of swooping heat the offhanded comment lit up low in her belly. "If you take me to <em>your</em> bar, I'm jumping out at the next red light."</p><p>"Please," Rio scoffed. "I'm not subjecting you to another line of questioning. Not when you look one comment away from strangling someone."</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. "I don't look like that."</p><p>Rio shot her a sideways glance, unimpressed. "You just paid a stupid amount of money for a dinner you barely touched, and listened to your mother questioning your entire personality. I'd be surprised if that didn't awaken some murderous thoughts."</p><p>"And yet, you trapped yourself in a car with me," she noticed, gesturing to the confined space. "Aren't you afraid of my <em>murderous thoughts?</em>"</p><p>Rio snorted. "I think I can handle them. Besides, if I mysteriously disappeared, you'd be the first suspect."</p><p>"Oh, really?"</p><p>"Yeah," Rio shot her a smirk, wiggling her eyebrows. "The spouse is always the prime suspect."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the corners of her lips twitched despite herself. "I'll make it look like an accident."</p><p>Rio gasped dramatically, clutching her chest with one hand while the other remained steady on the wheel. "Betrayed by my own wife. The tragedy."</p><p>Agatha shook her head, looking out the window as the city lights flickered past. The tension from the dinner still pressed heavily against her ribs, but Rio's effortless banter was starting to loosen it, piece by piece.</p><p>"So, where are you taking me?" she asked after a beat of silence, not recognizing the street they were on.</p><p>"Into the woods to murder you," Rio replied without missing a beat, amusement lighting up her voice as she shot Agatha another glance. "Relax. I think you'll like it."</p><p>"Getting murdered? You could've done that <em>before</em> I had to sit through dinner with my mother," Agatha shot back, earning a chuckle.</p><p>The road ahead stretched into the distance, dark but not ominous. They weren't heading toward the kind of place Agatha expected - not a loud, crowded bar with dim lighting and a sea of sweaty bodies pressed together on the dancefloor. Instead, the neon signs and busy sidewalks had given way to something quieter, something slower.</p><p>When Rio finally pulled up outside a small, cozy building, Agatha blinked.</p><p>"You do realize bookstores don't sell alcohol, right?"</p><p>Rio grinned as she killed the engine. "This one does. It's a hidden gem."</p><p>Agatha eyed the warm glow spilling out from the large front windows, where shelves of books lined the walls, stretching high up to the ceiling. Nestled between them was a long wooden bar with a bartender lazily polishing a glass behind it. The place was quiet and intimate - nothing like the rowdy nightmare she had braced herself for.</p><p>"Come on, <em>gorgeous</em>," Rio said with a grin, hopping out of the car. "Let's get you that drink."</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only a second before sighing and stepping out, letting the door click shut behind her. She followed Rio to the door, the scent of aged paper and whiskey hitting her the second they stepped inside.</p><p>The space was small but well-curated, lined with towering bookshelves that gave it a hushed, almost sacred air. Tucked in the back, past cozy armchairs and dim reading lamps, the bar stretched in a neat curve, manned by a single bartender who barely looked up as they entered.</p><p>"Go ahead and choose a seat," Rio nudged her toward one of the tables overlooked by the massive bookshelves. "I'll be right back."</p><p>Agatha nodded absentmindedly, her sharp heels clicking against the polished wood as she approached a table set by a window, her eyes skimming the shelves. Fiction, history, philosophy - the titles stacked in well-loved rows, some even with scribbled notes sticking from between the pages.</p><p>She could imagine why Rio brought her to a place like that after the nerve-wracking dinner. The ambiance emanated peace and warmth, so different from the restaurant's cold marble and pristine gold that Agatha felt her muscles relax as she sat in the plush chair, letting the comforting air drain her body of the residual tension.</p><p>"Here you go," Rio reappeared, handing her a glass of whisky before easing into the chair opposite her.</p><p>Agatha raised her brows, eyes jumping between the beer in Rio's hand and her own drink. "I'm not leaving my car here," she said, moving to put the glass on the table. "Or letting you drive drunk."</p><p>"Would you relax for a second?" Rio sipped on her beer. "This barely has any alcohol in it. I took the lightest one they had."</p><p>"Weren't <em>you</em> the one in need of a drink?" Agatha countered, but leaned back in her chair, glass still in hand.</p><p>"I didn't spend an entire dinner getting insulted," Rio's face softened slightly, her dark eyes shining in the faint light. "Can I ask you something?"</p><p>Agatha's grip on the glass tightened. Something told her she wouldn't like the question, but Rio didn't wait for an answer.</p><p>"Why do you keep in touch with her?"</p><p>"She's my mother."</p><p>It was an instinctive answer, one she had been giving her friends ever since they had known her enough to ask.</p><p>Repeated until they stopped questioning it, accepting the words with a defeated sigh and a nod as if finding a rebuttal was too tiring.</p><p>Rio didn't seem to think so.</p><p>"It doesn't mean anything if she treats you like that," she said, voice measured.</p><p>Agatha sipped on her drink, nails clinking against the glass in a slow, steady rhythm. "Doesn't it?" she sighed when Rio shifted in her chair, visibly readying herself to argue. "It's not that simple. I can't just... stop picking up the phone and forget she exists. Especially now."</p><p>"And before?" Rio prodded. "What stopped you before?"</p><p>She hesitated, unsure what the correct answer would be. For once, she settled on the truth. "She did."</p><p>The silence stretched for a moment, and Agatha let it, using the reprieve to gather her thoughts. If not for the exhaustion caused by spending two hours in her mother's presence, she would cut the conversation short, but she didn't have the strength to ward off Rio's questions.</p><p>"I tried to leave her in the past after I started practicing law," Agatha said slowly, each word burning her tongue more than the alcohol. "I blocked her number and cut ties with everyone who could spy on me for her. I even considered leaving the state, but I already had a job here, so I moved to a different apartment instead."</p><p>Rio listened intently, the usual teasing glint in her eyes replaced by something thoughtful, almost concerned. Agatha exhaled, the sight an immediate throwback to the night they had met - the night she had opened up to Rio about her mother for the first time, thinking they would never cross paths again.</p><p>Now, the words kept pouring out of her mouth despite the knowledge that she would not be free of Rio by the end of the evening.</p><p>"It worked for a while," she continued, her fingertip tracing the rim of the glass. "Three months without a single word from her. I almost thought I was free."</p><p>Rio's gaze sharpened. "But?"</p><p>Agatha huffed a humorless laugh. "But we've already established that Evanora Harkness doesn't <em>give up,</em>" her fingers tightened around the glass. "She came to my apartment. Said the time was to let me cool off, to make me realize the legacy I was throwing away on a whim."</p><p>"Legacy," Rio echoed like the word left a bad taste in her mouth.</p><p>"She always called it that. Like my entire life was some grand inheritance I could only accept," Agatha shook her head. "I knew her visit was only the beginning, a warning. It wouldn't look good for her if the press found out her daughter cut ties with her."</p><p>Rio's jaw twitched. "It was about her image."</p><p>Agatha chuckled humorlessly at the subtle shock layering the woman's voice. "Well, it certainly wasn't about <em>me</em>. Either way, I unblocked her number by the end of the visit and just.. stuck around. It was the lesser of two evils."</p><p>"What was the other evil?"</p><p>"Ruining my career," Agatha leaned back in her chair, swirling her drink with a thoughtful look. "I was making my name as a lawyer, aspiring to be a partner. My mother could've easily stalled my career at the time."</p><p>Rio frowned, narrowing her eyes. "Wasn't Lilia the one who made you a partner? She hates Evanora."</p><p>"It didn't matter. Becoming a partner means bringing in clients, and my mother knows everyone who is anyone in this city, hell, in this <em>state,</em>" Agatha sighed, looking out the window at the almost empty street. "The visit made me realize I'd never be free of her, and I learned to live with it."</p><p>When Rio stayed silent, Agatha glanced at her, immediately noticing the familiar tension in the woman's face. The urge to fix, the same one she had shown the night Evanora had called, was carved into Rio's worry lines, deepened by the dim light.</p><p>"It could've been worse," she added as if the words could erase the look from Rio's face. "Between my job and Nicky, I rarely have time to entertain her. The dinners are few and in between."</p><p>Rio pressed her lips into a thin line. "That's why she added the clause to the will, right? Because you started pulling away again."</p><p>"She’s creative with her punishments," Agatha shrugged, lifting the glass to her lips. "She probably didn’t expect me to fight it, though. I don’t think we’ll hear from her for a while. She'll take her time to regroup and prepare a new strategy."</p><p>"That's daunting," Rio leaned further into her chair, kicking out her legs under the table. "And here I was thinking my parental situation was rough."</p><p>Agatha raised her brows at the offhanded remark. Ever since her unfair assumption about Rio's parents, they had not spoken about her childhood - her <em>past</em>, for that matter.</p><p>It didn't mean Agatha wasn't curious. Due to their arrangement, Rio had found out more about her life than she would like, and whenever she caught the woman staring wistfully at the framed photos in her house or talking on her phone in rapid Spanish, she felt the urge to prod - to get to know her more.</p><p>Still, Rio never volunteered information about it. Their relationship, whatever it was, had been built on the present, on contracts and sharp banter, not on the ghosts that trailed behind them, so Agatha never asked.</p><p>But tonight felt different. Maybe it was the whisky, maybe the lingering tension from dinner, or maybe the quiet way Rio had said the words. Like she wasn't making a joke or deflecting.</p><p>For once, it felt like an opening rather than a defense mechanism. And Agatha, for all her instincts to avoid messy, heartfelt conversations, stepped through it.</p><p>"You don't talk about it," she noted, not an accusation but a simple observation.</p><p>Rio lifted a shoulder in a lazy shrug, but the way she avoided Agatha's gaze betrayed the forced nonchalance. "I figured we weren't in this to get to know each other."</p><p>"You know plenty about me."</p><p>"Oh, so it's a tit-for-tat situation?" the humorous lilt in Rio's voice fell flat between them as Agatha tilted her head. Rio rolled her eyes at the gesture. "Not much to talk about."</p><p>Agatha set her drink down with a quiet clink. "I find that hard to believe."</p><p>"Look at you," Rio chuckled, the sound almost forced. "All curious all of a sudden."</p><p>Agatha didn't respond, just waited. She knew Rio well enough by now - if she pushed too hard, the woman would deflect, turn it into a joke, redirect the conversation before Agatha even had the time to catch up.</p><p>Rio sighed, toying with the glass in her hands. "You already know my parents died, and I had to move."</p><p>"What do you remember about them?"</p><p>Rio blinked as if the question caught her off guard. She frowned slightly, gaze drifting somewhere past Agatha, to a place neither of them could see. "My ma loved flowers," she murmured after a beat. "The entire house was always covered with them; we had more vases than cups."</p><p>Agatha smiled but stayed silent, letting Rio continue at her own pace.</p><p>"My dad was a morning person. Annoyingly so," Rio huffed a quiet laugh, shaking her head. "He'd blast music while making breakfast, sing off-key just to get a rise out of ma. It worked every time, especially when I joined him."</p><p>Agatha could see it - the warmth behind the words, the way Rio's face softened with the memory. But it didn't last.</p><p>"They were happy," Rio said, the words hollowing out as she exhaled. "And then they were gone. Just like that," she snapped her fingers, the sound sharp in the quiet space between them.</p><p>"Then, my abuela moved me to live with her before I even knew what the hell was happening," Rio leaned back in her chair, rubbing a hand over her face. "One day I was home singing with my dad, and the next I was in a city I'd never been to, living with a woman I barely knew."</p><p>Agatha frowned. "You didn't know her?"</p><p>"She visited a couple of times and called on birthdays. But she was a voice on the phone, you know? Not a <em>person</em> in my life," Rio shook her head. "Same with the rest of my ma's family. Most of them I couldn't remember ever seeing, and then they were raising me."</p><p>"Why didn't your family from New York take you in?" Agatha asked cautiously. "You must've known them better."</p><p>Rio pursed her lips. "They decided a fresh start would be better. Away from the ghosts and the memories."</p><p>"That's bullshit," Agatha said before she could process her words, smiling when Rio laughed.</p><p>"That's the explanation they gave me," she shrugged again. "It worked out in the end. As strict as my abuela is, I wouldn't be here without her."</p><p>Agatha studied Rio for a long moment, letting the words settle between them. It was strange, seeing her like this - unguarded, reflective. The woman who usually wielded sarcasm like a shield, who teased and taunted like it was her second nature, suddenly seemed... exposed.</p><p>And yet, Rio didn't seem uncomfortable.</p><p>Maybe it was the dim lighting, the hushed atmosphere of the bar, or the fact that Agatha hadn't pressed, had simply listened. Whatever the reason, Rio hadn’t shut down or changed the subject.</p><p>“You miss them,” Agatha said quietly.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio’s fingers traced the condensation on her glass. “It seems so stupid. I was barely old enough to remember them when they died, and I still wake up every day feeling like a part of me is missing.”</p><p>“It’s not stupid,” Agatha opposed, her tone firm but gentle. “It’s grief.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered up, searching her face. “You’re speaking from experience.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question, but Agatha nodded anyway, swallowing another sip of the whiskey. “My dad died when I was five. Heart attack,” she admitted. “I barely remember anything about him, but I miss the idea of him, you know? All the things that could’ve been, all the words my mother wouldn’t have said if he were there,” Agatha sighed, feeling a lump form in her throat. “I like to think she wasn’t like that before he died. That love softened her edges, and the loss sharpened them irrevocably.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, her fingers stilling their movements to wrap around the glass. “Grief doesn’t turn people into monsters,” she noticed slowly, eyes thoughtful as they rested on Agatha’s face. “But you deserved someone to protect you. You still do.”</p><p>The words hung between them, raw and heavy from their implications.</p><p>“I learned how to take care of myself,” Agatha said finally, voice quiet but without self-pity. Like she was stating a fact. “Relying on other people for protection is foolish.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look away. “It’s not about surrendering your autonomy, though. Just about letting somebody else care for you,” she drummed her fingers against the glass, eyes never leaving Agatha’s. “Just because you learned how to protect yourself doesn’t mean you don’t deserve somebody who’ll fight for you. With you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply. She wasn’t sure she could. The ache in her throat had solidified, lodged somewhere deep in her chest. She hated how well Rio could read her sometimes - how she never looked away when the sharp parts showed.</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair, finally shifting her attention from Agatha to gaze out the window. The warm glow of the street lamps softened her edges, making her look more like a helpless girl still haunted by the past than the woman who had faced Evanora without flinching.</p><p>“You know,” Rio murmured, voice low, “when I was a kid, I used to think grief would make me stronger. Like I’d grow up tough because I knew loss early,” she let out a soft snort, almost self-mocking. “Turns out, it just made me lonely. And a very annoying teenager set on making my abuela’s life difficult.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled faintly, barely a smile, but present. “You’re still annoying.”</p><p>Rio looked back at her, eyebrow arched. “It’s a conscious choice now.”</p><p>“Of course it is,” Agatha muttered, making Rio laugh quietly.</p><p>There was a long pause then, both letting the moment settle.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, resting her arms on the table. Her glass was nearly empty, but she didn’t reach for it again. “I think I used to believe something similar. That being alone meant being safe. That needing anyone meant giving them a weapon.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. That tracks.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, meeting her eyes. “But it doesn’t really work, does it?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said simply. “It just means you’re the one holding the weapon. And eventually, you start cutting yourself on it.”</p><p>That made Agatha fall still.</p><p>No deflections. No clever retorts. Just quiet.</p><p>And then, finally, she said, “I don’t know how to let someone do that. Fight with me.”</p><p>“You don’t have to know,” Rio muttered, her eyes as warm as her tone. “You just have to want to try.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, at the softness behind the words, at the way Rio’s fingers had stopped fidgeting. She’d gone still in that rare way again, unguarded, but solid.</p><p>And something inside Agatha moved, not suddenly, but distinctly.</p><p>She didn’t say anything more. She didn’t need to.</p><p>But she didn’t look away either.</p>

<p>Something had shifted.</p><p>Agatha didn't know <em>when</em> or <em>how </em>it happened, but she felt it in every unspoken moment, every effortless interaction.</p><p>It hung in the air when she walked into the kitchen and found Rio already there, humming along to the music as she chopped vegetables, stirred a simmering pot, or flipped pancakes with practiced ease. A few days ago, Agatha would have rolled her eyes, grumbled about the noise, and maybe even snapped at Rio to turn it down. Now? Now, she found herself tapping her foot to the rhythm, humming under her breath as she lingered in the kitchen for a second longer than necessary.</p><p>It stretched between them at the dining table, a silent thread of understanding as Agatha sifted through contracts and emails while Rio graded papers or jotted down notes for her research. For weeks, this had been a point of friction with Agatha claiming the space out of habit and Rio invading it out of necessity. She used to glare at Rio's presence like it was an offense, snapping her laptop shut and retreating to her office without a word. But now? Now she stayed. Now, she acknowledged Rio's company with a nod, accepting it like a natural part of her routine.</p><p>It stole her breath every time Rio disappeared into the kitchen for a snack and returned with a cup of tea or a glass of water, setting it beside Agatha without a word. A small, thoughtful gesture so ordinary that it shouldn't have felt like <em>everything, </em>but it did.</p><p>Domesticity bordering on <em>softness</em>.</p><p>None of it was new. <em>But it had never felt like this before.</em></p><p>It felt like the brittle truce established almost a month ago solidified, taking on its rightful shape and springing into existence before Agatha could process the shift.</p><p>Suddenly, the nature of the arrangement - the contracts, the logic, and the boundaries - changed, softened under the pressure of the dinner with Evanora and the dim light of the bar where they had talked without deflecting or running away.</p><p>It wasn't just about tolerating each other anymore.</p><p>Agatha noticed it in the way Rio moved through her home - <em>their</em> home, technically. She had always been comfortable in the space, making herself at home with an ease that had once irritated Agatha beyond reason. But now, instead of seeing it as an invasion, she <em>watched</em>. She observed the way Rio leaned against the counter, scrolling through her phone as the coffee machine whirred to life. The way she stretched her arms overhead in the morning, her spine arching like a lazy cat as she grumbled a raspy "morning", her voice thick with sleep.</p><p>Despite living with Rio for almost a month now, Agatha had never bothered to pay attention - or rather, suppressed the urge to follow the woman with her eyes as she went about her day. She had never initiated conversations unless they involved the deal or something in Rio's behavior that she wanted changed.</p><p>Now, she caught herself asking Rio about her day and actually <em>wanting</em> to hear the answer.</p><p>Now, every time she ordered takeout for dinner, she automatically included Rio's favorite, stashing it on the woman's side of the fridge for an after-work snack.</p><p>Now, she waited for Rio to come home, listening for the jingle of keys at the door. She noticed when Rio was running late and found herself annoyed - not because it disrupted her routine, but because it left an absence where something familiar should be.</p><p>She also noticed that Rio had learned her rhythms - how she didn't push when Agatha was immersed in her work, wordlessly handed over a cup of coffee at just the right moment, and always found a way to make Agatha laugh when she least expected it.</p><p>Everything was the same. Rio's behavior had not changed, but the way Agatha <em>felt</em> about it did.</p><p>It was infuriating. It was terrifying.</p><p>But she couldn't <em>stop</em>.</p><p>She couldn't revert to her old ways of shutting down every conversation, of treating Rio like an annoying ghost haunting her house, no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>Because Rio wasn't a ghost - she was undeniably <em>there</em>, woven into the fabric of Agatha's days in a way that felt almost natural.</p><p>Agatha had spent years perfecting the art of keeping people at a distance. She knew how to compartmentalize and draw lines that no one was allowed to cross. And yet, somehow, Rio had sidestepped them entirely, not by force, but by simply <em>being there</em>.</p><p>By defending her against Evanora's scrutiny. By taking her to the bar to unwind before returning home. By listening without judgment.</p><p>The dinner had shifted something. And Agatha wasn't sure if she could - or even <em>wanted </em>- to shift it back.</p><p>Still, it wasn't a <em>big deal</em>.</p><p>If anything, it worked in their favor. Their arrangement required more than mere tolerance; they needed to sell it. Convince the world their marriage was real, not just in name but in presence, in familiarity, in the way they occupied the same space without friction. The shift made that easier. <em>More believable</em>.</p><p>That was all Agatha cared about.</p><p>At least that's what she told herself when she found Rio asleep on the couch, head propped against the armrest, one leg extended parallel to the cushions while the other slid off the seat and rested limply on the floor.</p><p>She must have dozed off mid-grading, the papers scattered across her stomach, the coffee table, and the floor, one hand loosely gripping a red pen that had smudged ink along her fingers.</p><p>Agatha hovered in the doorway, arms crossed, trying to decide what to do.</p><p>The best approach was to wake the woman, preferably by violently shaking her and growling about occupying the entire couch.</p><p>Normally, she would.</p><p><em>She should</em>.</p><p>But Rio looked soft: mouth parted slightly, hair messily falling over her face, the usual sharp edges dulled by sleep. It was a far cry from the woman who had met Evanora's gaze head-on at dinner, keeping her chin lifted in defiance as she dismantled the politician's strategy of exposing them. Here, Rio was unguarded. And Agatha, for reasons she refused to examine, couldn't look away.</p><p>She sighed, shifting her weight on her feet. <em>Fucking ridiculous</em>.</p><p>A smarter person would have shaken Rio awake or retreated from the room. Instead, Agatha quietly approached the couch, her eyes glued to Rio's face to watch for any signs of awareness as she gathered the scattered papers and set them in a neat pile on the table. Then, she gently plucked the pen from between Rio's fingers and grabbed the throw blanket draped over the armrest.</p><p>She hesitated for only a moment before unfolding it and carefully draping it over Rio.</p><p>It was simple practicality. Rio was always complaining about the house being too cold, and Agatha knew she would already be cranky in the morning from sleeping on the couch. The blanket was damage control.</p><p>It certainly wasn't because something in her chest did an unfamiliar twist at the sight of Rio curled up on <em>her</em> couch, so completely at ease in a place Agatha never expected anyone else to belong.</p><p>Shaking her head, Agatha turned away, determined to put the whole thing out of her mind.</p><p>Half-heartedly, she also made a mental note to yell at Rio in the morning for hogging the couch. For good measure.</p><p>But as she settled into her bed that night, she caught herself listening for movement, for the telltale creak of the couch or the soft shuffle of Rio waking up and retreating to her room.</p><p>When it didn't come, when the house remained quiet, Agatha stared at the ceiling for far too long before rolling onto her side with an exasperated sigh.</p><p>It wasn't a big deal.</p><p>Just an adjustment.</p><p>Nothing more.</p><hr/><p>Between the shift, a week even busier than regular, and the lingering weight of seeing her mother again, Agatha felt worse about the gala than she typically did.</p><p>Which said a lot, considering these events were the bane of her existence.</p><p>A bane dressed up in elegant clothes, expensive alcohol, and a crowd of people so detached from reality she was convinced half of them wouldn't know their right from their left without an assistant whispering into their ear.</p><p>As she combed her hair into a bun - looser than her usual style, but still sharp enough to scream <em>don't talk to me</em> - she wondered if it was too late to fake an emergency. Maybe she could call Lilia, cough like she'd smoked three packs a day since birth, and plead contagion.</p><p>In hindsight, she should've soft-launched her fake illness during the partner meeting two days ago.</p><p>Not that Lilia would've believed her, but still.</p><p>A soft knock broke her from the fantasy. "You almost ready?"</p><p>Agatha groaned. Right. That was the <em>other</em> reason she dreaded this particular gala more than usual.</p><p>How could she forget?</p><p>Suddenly, coming down with the flu sounded downright luxurious.</p><p>"Have you ever heard of being fashionably late?" she called back, adjusting the collar of her shirt and staring at her reflection like it might offer her an escape route.</p><p>Well, at least she looked good.</p><p>The purple suit, so dark that it seemed black unless it caught light, hugged her frame like it was made for her, which it was. The silk blouse beneath added just enough softness to take the edge off the razor-sharp tailoring, while the loose bun gave her an air of effortless control. She looked like someone you didn't argue with. Someone who didn't flinch under pressure.</p><p>Too bad she had to waste that look on a stupid work event.</p><p>"Nothing about being late is fashionable," Rio's voice came through the door, slightly muffled but carrying a noticeable note of urgency. "It's rude."</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to groan, slipping on her heels. "This is a work event, not a hostage situation."</p><p>"Could've fooled me."</p><p>She opened the door with a sharp tug, already midway through an eye-roll, only to stop dead in her tracks.</p><p>Rio stood in the hallway, leaning against the wall with one heeled foot tapping the floor in a steady rhythm. Her dress was simple but elegant, the green deep and rich against her skin, her hair pinned up with a kind of effortlessness that many envied.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha couldn't remember why she hated the events.</p><p>"Something on my face?" Rio drawled, tilting her head.</p><p>Agatha blinked, realizing her eyes weren't even <em>on</em> Rio's face. They dipped dangerously low, mapping out the neckline of the dress.</p><p>Snapping them up took more effort than it should.</p><p>Not that it helped because Rio was watching her with that knowing smile, lips painted the same shade as trouble, and eyes lined in smoky defiance.</p><p>What was the question again?</p><p>Ah, right.</p><p>"An annoying smirk," Agatha managed, somehow steady. "Now, stop making us late."</p><p>Rio scoffed, pushing off the wall. "I've been ready for half an hour."</p><p>"You want an award or something?"</p><p>If the sarcasm stung, Rio didn't show it. She just stepped forward, slow and confident, her fingers brushing over Agatha's shoulder and smoothing out the fabric with maddening care.</p><p>"Yes, actually," she murmured, fingers drifting to the lapel of Agatha's blazer, straightening it with far more intimacy than necessary. She leaned in, voice low enough to feel like a secret. "Can you promise me you'll at least try to enjoy it?"</p><p>Agatha stared at her, heart skipping in a way that had nothing to do with gala speeches or client schmoozing.</p><p>"I'll try not to commit a felony," she said flatly.</p><p>Rio grinned like that was better than a yes. "Perfect," her fingers lingered for a second longer before pulling back, leaving Agatha's pulse at an unhealthy rate and her mind in shambles.</p><p>Yeah. That was another shift.</p><p>After the dinner with Evanora, Rio had become... <em>more physical</em>.</p><p>Nothing overt. Nothing inappropriate. But definitely <em>more</em>: a hand on the small of Agatha's back in the kitchen, a brush of fingers passing a coffee mug, a casual squeeze to the shoulder when she needed her attention.</p><p>They didn't talk about it, didn't acknowledge it.</p><p>But Agatha felt every single touch like a live wire under her skin.</p><p>She suspected that - much like the slow infiltration of endearments - Rio was trying to desensitize her. To train her not to flinch and prepare her for a world that expected ease and familiarity.</p><p>It didn't make it any less maddening.</p><p>And yet, Agatha couldn't bring herself to tell her to stop.</p><p>Okay. So maybe she was touch-starved. Maybe she hadn't had sex in longer than she was willing to admit, even under oath.</p><p>
<em>Sue her.</em>
</p><p>Agatha sucked in a steadying breath, hoping it looked more like a fight for patience than a desperate attempt at calming her erratic pulse. "Let's just go before Lilia sends someone to collect us."</p><p>Rio raised her brows. "Has she ever actually done that?"</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha started toward the stairs, the memory of two burly men showing up at her doorstep replaying in her mind. "Even gave them permission to use force to put me in the car."</p><p>"Okay, now I'm more inclined to be <em>fashionably late</em>," Rio laughed. "I'd pay good money to see them try to tame you."</p><p>Agatha stopped on the first step, shooting Rio a smirk over her shoulder. "Oh, honey, there's no taming this tiger."</p><p>Well, at least she could give as good as she got if the blush spreading across Rio's cheeks was anything to go by.</p><p>After a brief obstacle in the form of Sharon, who gushed about how good they looked together and how long it had been since she'd been to a party of <em>any</em> kind, they said their goodbyes to Nicky and stepped out the door. A sleek black SUV was already idling at the curb, polished to perfection.</p><p>Rio's eyes landed on the man leaning against the passenger door. His spine was ramrod straight, his blazer strained at the biceps, and his face was set in that unnerving, perfectly neutral way that said he'd wait another hour without blinking.</p><p>"Did Lilia send him?" she asked as they descended the porch steps, eyes narrowing as she scanned him. "Because if he starts dragging you into the car, I'm letting it happen. Might even film it."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "He's my driver. But I'm touched by your loyalty."</p><p>Rio glanced at her with an amused squint. "You have a driver?"</p><p>"Only for events like this," Agatha said with the kind of practiced indifference that usually meant she expected judgment and had already decided she didn't care. "I'm not sitting through any of it sober, and calling an Uber is..." she trailed off, searching for the right word.</p><p>"Beneath your tax bracket?" Rio supplied, smirking.</p><p>That earned her a second, more dramatic eye-roll. "These events are about appearances. The more money you <em>look</em> like you have, the more the clients trust you."</p><p>"Well, that's pretentious."</p><p>Agatha gave a small, elegant shrug. "Pretentious keeps the lights on."</p><p>"Still," Rio said, stepping closer as they reached the car. "I could've driven us. I think your car's nice enough for pretentious pricks."</p><p>"You wouldn't want to take Greg's job, would you?" Agatha quipped, nodding at the man. "Good evening, Greg."</p><p>"Good evening, Mrs. Harkness, Mrs. Vidal," Greg said with a crisp nod. He stepped forward to open the back door with the kind of smooth professionalism that only came from a hundred other events.</p><p>Agatha glided into the car like it was second nature. She buckled her seatbelt and crossed her legs as Greg rounded to the other side and opened the door for Rio.</p><p>"We should be there in fifteen minutes," he informed them once they were on the move.</p><p>Agatha hummed in acknowledgment, then turned fully to Rio, her expression frozen in calm professionalism.</p><p>"Alright. Rule number one," she said, holding up her pointer finger. "Do <em>not</em> call anyone there a pretentious prick."</p><p>Rio's mouth twitched. "Not even behind their back?"</p><p>Agatha considered it. "Fine. Behind their back is acceptable. Just make sure they're at least four tables away."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am."</p><p>Agatha raised her middle finger, ignoring Rio's snort. "Rule number two: if you hear someone mention obscure art auctions, horse breeding, or owning a vineyard in Italy, <em>run</em>. You're being lured into a conversation no amount of alcohol will help you survive."</p><p>"That doesn't sound so-"</p><p>"No," Agatha shook her head. "It's <em>bad</em>. Trust me. And rule number three," her ring finger joined the other two. "Only answer the questions you're asked. No unnecessary delving into details, especially about our relationship."</p><p>Rio's brows lifted slightly, glancing at Greg. His eyes stayed trained on the road ahead, but the faint smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth gave him away.</p><p>"Isn't the point of this to spread the word?" she asked, lowering her voice as if keeping the conversation between them, even though Greg had clearly clocked every word.</p><p>"Yes, but that doesn't mean I want everyone to know everything," Agatha pointed out. "These are people I work with. People I work <em>for</em>. They only need to see what I choose to show."</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, settling deeper into the leather seat, fingers tapping a distracted rhythm against her knee. "So, to recap: I can talk shit in whispers, flee at the first sign of horses or vineyards, and I'm a mysterious, shiny arm candy who doesn't talk too much."</p><p>Agatha didn't laugh.</p><p>Her jaw tightened, the comment grating in a way she hadn't expected. Not because Rio was joking, but because she wasn't <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>She glanced over, taking in Rio's relaxed posture, the perfect mix of beauty and confidence. The kind of aura people noticed before they even registered anything else.</p><p>It wasn't fair.</p><p>Because Rio wasn't just beautiful. She was brilliant. She had the kind of mind that unraveled the complexities of her work with casual ease and explained scientific breakthroughs like bedtime stories.</p><p>But here, at the kind of event Agatha had to drag her to, they'd only see what they wanted to see. A younger woman on the arm of someone powerful.</p><p>They wouldn't see <em>Rio.</em></p><p>"I don't like that," Agatha admitted quietly. "You're not arm candy."</p><p>Rio turned toward her, surprised by the shift in her tone, but still looking amused.</p><p>"A trophy wife, then," she quipped.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. "No," she said, gaze steady and voice firm. "You’re a brilliant PhD student who wants to change the world and happens to be my wife. Not a trophy."</p><p>It hung between them for a moment, heavier than the air in the car, warm in a way that made Rio's amusement melt away into something more honest.</p><p>Then, Rio reached across the middle seat and rested her hand gently on Agatha's jumping knee.</p><p>"I know," she muttered softly. "I was just joking."</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, the tension in her muscles lessening.</p><p>Greg, still focused on the road, said nothing, but the smile on his face widened just enough to be noticed.</p><p>The car pulled up to the curb outside a grand hotel, its towering entrance illuminated with soft golden lights and the glow of too many chandeliers. The kind of place that screamed elegance and luxury, where not even the warm lights could make one feel welcome without enough zeroes in their bank account.</p><p>Greg stepped out first, a well-rehearsed move, the starting gun for the performance. He rounded the car to Agatha's side, pulling it open and stepping aside.</p><p>When her feet hit the pavement, the cold air almost made her shiver, the soft hum of conversation and laughter slipping past the closed door and reaching her ears.</p><p>By the time she adjusted the hem of her coat, Greg had already crossed over to Rio's side. She emerged from the car with a quiet kind of elegance, the uncovered parts of her dress catching the light like the surface of a dark lake, subtle and smooth.</p><p>Agatha stood up straighter without meaning to.</p><p>Rio joined her with a calm curiosity, eyes tracking the movement behind the tall glass doors. She leaned closer.</p><p>"That's some Gilded Age shit," she muttered, eyeing the guests inside - people draped in designer brands, their laughter just a little too sharp, their smiles a bit too wide.</p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh, brushing her index finger against Rio's hand in silent invitation. "Ready?"</p><p>Rio didn't hesitate. Her fingers slipped between Agatha's with ease, warm and grounding.</p><p>"Born ready," she whispered back with a smirk, then leaned in just enough for her breath to graze the shell of Agatha's ear. "Just point me to the nearest pretentious prick."</p><p>Agatha bit back a smile and gave her a warning glare, but pulled her toward the door.</p><p>They crossed the threshold together, into marble and gold and music that hung in the air like expensive perfume. Eyes turned to the almost instantly.</p><p>Sharks sensing blood. Like in those stupid documentaries Rio loved so much.</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip, already scanning the crowd. She needed a buffer, someone tolerable, familiar. Lilia, maybe Jen. Anyone to slow the inevitable parade of small talk and subtle jabs masked as compliments.</p><p>Rio followed quietly at her side, taking in the extravagance like a foreign language. Everything shimmered - gold leaf embellishments and polished floors reflecting the crystal overhead. It was beautiful in a cold, detached way.</p><p>The crowd moved like clockwork, laughter striking on cue, each conversation a veiled flex - yachts, estates, vintage wine collections - and yet everyone pretended not to care about the money they so clearly had.</p><p>"You know," Rio murmured, her lips near Agatha's ear. "I think this room is just <em>entirely</em> pretentious pricks."</p><p>The corners of Agatha's lips twitched. "Took you long enough,"</p><p>That was when she spotted Lilia across the room, deep in conversation with one of their wealthier clients. When their eyes met, Lilia gave a subtle, beckoning nod.</p><p>"Still want me to enjoy it?" Agatha asked, leading them forward.</p><p>Rio chuckled under her breath. "Not committing a felony seems like a bigger ask by the minute."</p><p>Agatha gave her a sidelong look. "Jury's still out on that."</p><p>She steered them toward Lilia, the lights bright above, the noise thick around them.</p><p>"Come on. Let's say hello."</p><p>When they were close enough to hear the conversation - unsurprisingly focused on money and work - Lilia flicked her wrist toward them, making the man stop mid-sentence to glance over his shoulder.</p><p>"My, my," he said, voice smooth like aged whiskey and just as sour in the aftertaste. "Agatha Harkness. And here I thought you'd make your usual late entrance, with just enough time to be seen and not spoken to."</p><p>Agatha smiled tightly, resisting the urge to step back from the overwhelmingly potent cologne surrounding the man like an oppressive cloud. "I would never miss a good party, Mr. Fisk."</p><p>His broad shoulders shook as he chuckled, hollow and cold. "Of course not," his gaze drifted to Rio, pausing like he was sizing up a piece of art he hadn't decided how to price yet. "And you are?"</p><p>"Rio Vidal," she said, extending her hand with polite confidence. "Agatha's wife."</p><p>Fisk took her hand and bent slightly, brushing his lips over her knuckles with an old-world flair that felt more calculated than courteous. "Ah," he said, straightening with a hum. "So the rumors were true."</p><p>The shift in his focus was instant. Back to Agatha as if Rio had been a footnote.</p><p>"Congratulations," he added dryly. "Though I hear your mother's not particularly thrilled with the arrangement."</p><p>Agatha's spine stiffened. She opened her mouth, ready to slice through his arrogance with something less than professional, but Lilia beat her to it, her tone dipped in velvet steel.</p><p>"Mr. Fisk, I didn't take you for a man so easily swayed by gossip."</p><p>He chuckled again, this time more briefly. "Information can be just as useful as money, Ms. Calderu."</p><p>His eyes flicked down to Agatha and Rio's joined hands before returning to Lilia. "But very well. I'll leave you ladies to your evening. We'll finish our chat later."</p><p>When he walked into the crowd, his imposing statue sticking out like a sore thumb, Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose. "He's as slippery as ever."</p><p>Lilia nodded, eyes lingering on the man's back. "Comes with his line of work, I'm afraid."</p><p>"And what's that?" Rio chimed in, visibly confused.</p><p>Agatha blinked. "You don't know him?"</p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>"That's Wilson Fisk," she said, observing Rio's face. "Half the city in his pocket. Political influence, corporate takeovers, alleged criminal ties..."</p><p>"Are you even allowed to say that?"</p><p>"<em>Alleged</em>," Agatha emphasized. "Do you live under a rock or something?"</p><p>Rio laughed at the genuine surprise in her voice, shrugging. "I don't keep tabs on rich assholes in the city. It's bad for my mental health."</p><p>"Smart," Lilia commented, adjusting her silk shawl. Despite her black dress being relatively simple, her stacked bracelets and the way she carried herself made her stand out like a queen among pawns. She glanced at her watch. "Time for the speeches. I'll see you later."</p><p>Then, with a meaningful look at Rio, she added, "Keep her from leaving too early, would you?"</p><p>"She's not my babysitter," Agatha scowled, but Lilia was already melting back into the crowd like smoke.</p><p>Rio gave Agatha's hand a gentle squeeze. "Well, that's it," she said with mock seriousness. "Boss's orders. You're officially under supervision."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the corner of her mouth betrayed her. "You're enjoying this, aren't you?"</p><p>"Deeply," Rio said, her smile wide. "Come on, Mrs. Harkness. Let's get you a drink and find a quiet corner to talk shit about people."</p><p>Okay, so maybe that particular gala wouldn’t be so bad.</p><hr/><p>After the speeches - uninspired, repetitive, and almost criminally sleep-inducing - the energy in the room shifted.</p><p>Lilia's closing toast to <em>future possibilities and continued collaboration</em> had barely finished echoing before half the room started moving. Some took it as their cue to leave, their obligations fulfilled. Others trickled back to their circles of power and politics, glasses of wine in hand, laughter already laced with self-importance. The smallest group drifted toward the dance floor.</p><p>The band played on, their string humming a familiar classical piece with just enough flair to be impressive but not enough to be remembered. The parquet floor gleamed beneath the chandeliers, polished to a mirror finish and wide enough to host a small wedding. Or a war.</p><p>Agatha lingered by the bar with Rio at her side, her eyes scanning the room like she was still on the clock. Which, technically, she was.</p><p>"Do people actually dance at these things?" Rio asked, sipping her drink, looking amused as she watched a couple begin the first slow, carefully choreographed movements.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. "Mostly the ones who think they have something to prove. Or want to close a deal and think stepping on their future partner's toes is a good idea."</p><p>"Sounds like there's a story there."</p><p>"A tragic one."</p><p>Rio leaned against the bar, turning so her body faced Agatha more fully. "So you dance?"</p><p>"You don't have to sound so surprised," Agatha chuckled, fingers tracing the stem of her glass as she glanced toward the few couples twirling on the polished floor. "My mother made sure I could survive any social death trap, including the ones set to a string quartet. I can dance. Well."</p><p>"Confident," Rio noted with a grin. "And here I thought lawyers only danced around questions."</p><p>Agatha glanced sidelong at her. "Please. I dance around subpoenas. Waltzing is comparatively easy."</p><p>"I promise not to step on your toes," Rio said, voice dropping slightly.</p><p>Agatha turned toward her then, eyebrow arched, mouth tugging into something sly. "All you do is step on my toes."</p><p>"Not on a dancefloor."</p><p>"Are you asking for a dance?"</p><p>Rio's grin widened. "Maybe."</p><p>But before Agatha could reply, a voice cut clean through the moment.</p><p>"Mrs. Harkness."</p><p>They both turned, the mood shifting with the precision of a well-timed cue. A woman approached, each step deliberate, her heels clicking against the marble floor like punctuation in a speech she hadn't rehearsed because she didn't need to. She was all lines and angles - sharp suit, slicked-back hair, and eyes lined with black makeup, flicking between them curiously.</p><p>Familiar, Agatha realized. Not immediately, but enough. It clicked the moment the woman stopped in front of them. "Ms. Odinsdottir," she greeted, polite and distant with the practiced ease of someone who could fake interest for a living.</p><p>Of all the potential interruptions, Hela Odinsdottir was at least an entertaining one. Razor-witted, slightly venomous, and never quite predictable. The kind of woman who could scare a room full of billionaires with a single smile and enjoy doing it.</p><p>"Are you enjoying the party?" Agatha asked, offering a courteous nod.</p><p>Hela's lips twitched like the question had amused her. "Immensely," she said. Her gaze flicked to Rio, appraising. "Your wife, I assume."</p><p>"Correct," Agatha confirmed, keeping her tone polite but firm.</p><p>Rio offered her hand. "Rio Vidal."</p><p>Hela took it, but instead of shaking, she held it for a second longer than necessary, her short nails scraping against the tan skin. "An academic, aren't you?"</p><p>Rio blinked. "Uh. Yes. Biological and biomedical sciences."</p><p>"I can always tell," Hela said smoothly, finally releasing Rio's hand, though her gaze lingered. "You have that sharp look in your eyes. The kind most people here lose after one too many dollars in their bank accounts."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, curiosity sparked. "Is that a compliment or a warning?"</p><p>Hela's smirk was sharp enough to draw blood. "Depends on what you do with it."</p><p>Agatha stepped in subtly, a shift in her stance placing her ever-so-slightly between them. "Rio's doing quite a bit with it. She's working on a thesis that'll probably make most of this room feel more obsolete than they already are."</p><p>Hela's eyes flicked to her, amused. "I don't doubt that. Though I must admit, it's hard to focus on academic accolades when someone looks like <em>that</em>."</p><p>Her gaze slid back to Rio, openly appreciative now, and Rio - <em>fucking</em> Rio - offered a polite smile, probably remembering their conversation from the car. An arm candy. A trophy wife. "The dress is doing most of the work."</p><p>Treating the words as an invitation, Hela's gaze dipped lower, past Rio's collarbones. "The cover rarely makes the book interesting."</p><p>Agatha's jaw clenched subtly when Rio laughed, brushing the comment off like it was just another wry remark from a rich stranger examining her with the curiosity of a child at a zoo seeing a strange animal for the first time.</p><p>"I'll let my advisor know I'm still worth reading," she joked, finishing her drink and putting it back on the bar.</p><p>Hela's smile didn't waver. "They'd be a fool not to."</p><p>Agatha had had enough.</p><p>She didn't interrupt so much as intervene, moving with a grace honed from years of courtroom poise and PR training. Her arm slid around Rio's waist, casual to the outside, but calculated down to the angle of her wrist. It was a territorial gesture dressed up in silk gloves and diplomacy, but the downright possessive way her fingers splayed over Rio's hip betrayed her.</p><p>For the appearances, of course.</p><p>"Don't let her fool you," she said, voice cool even as something warmer and far less professional coiled in her chest. "Rio's modest to a fault, but she has many aces up her sleeve."</p><p>"Ah," Hela turned her gaze on Agatha, and though her smile remained, her expression turned knowing. "Modesty? Such a rare trait in your line of work."</p><p>Agatha met her look head-on, unblinking. "I like to think I surround myself with the best qualities. It saves me from adopting even more terrible ones."</p><p>There was no mistaking the subtext in Hela's glance - she knew exactly what she was doing. And worse, she knew Agatha knew.</p><p>"Wise," Hela murmured. "Though I'd argue a little arrogance never hurt anyone."</p><p>Rio looked between them, sensing something but unable to name it. "This feels like a lawyer thing."</p><p>Agatha didn't look away from Hela. "Not everything's a lawyer thing, <em>darling</em>."</p><p>Okay, where the fuck did that come from? She decided not to dwell on it.</p><p>"No," Hela agreed, her tone almost lazy. "Some things are just human nature."</p><p>Before Rio could ask what that meant, a passing server offered champagne. Hela gracefully plucked a flute from the tray and took a slow sip, tipping her head in mock farewell.</p><p>"Well, I've monopolized enough of your time," she said, eyes already scanning the room for her next target. "Enjoy your evening."</p><p>They watched her go, her silhouette cutting through the crowd like a razor through silk.</p><p>Agatha finally let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding.</p><p>"That was... different," Rio said, her voice light with confusion, her head turning toward her. The soft lighting brushed her cheekbones, catching the edges of her smile. "<em>Darling</em>?"</p><p>Agatha didn't think before responding. "Yeah?"</p><p>"No, I mean - you called me darling. Where did that come from?"</p><p>Agatha hesitated. Just for a second. Long enough to matter.</p><p>"She was seconds away from shoving her tongue down your throat," she said evenly, keeping her expression composed. "I figured some possessiveness might help sell the story. Appearances and all."</p><p>Rio didn't press. She simply nodded, looking back toward the dancefloor like it hadn't stirred anything beneath the surface.</p><p>But for Agatha?</p><p>Her stomach twisted, slow and deliberate, a knot forming in the space between reason and something else she didn’t dare name.</p><p>It was just an act.</p><p>And yet-</p><p>The way Hela's hand lingered on Rio's skin. The unguarded appreciation in her voice. The casual way she leaned in like she had every right to.</p><p>Agatha wanted to believe her reaction was about the optics. About the performance. About maintaining the lie.</p><p>She wanted to believe the tension in her jaw, the heat still radiating from where her hand had rested on Rio’s hip, was only part of the role she played so well.</p><p>In this room, at this moment, their marriage was real.</p><p>And Agatha was a phenomenal actress.</p><p>That was all.</p><p>She withdrew her hand with the same composure she always wore, then extended it, palm up. When she spoke, her voice had softened, a thread of something warm curling beneath the surface.</p><p>"Still want to dance?"</p><p>Rio looked at her, blinking as if the offer had caught her off guard.</p><p>Then, slowly, she smiled. The kind of smile that reached her eyes.</p><p>"I thought you'd never ask."</p><p>Her fingers slid into Agatha’s with an ease that felt dangerous, like something Agatha might actually want to believe in.</p><p>Just for tonight. Just for this dance.</p><p>The music swelled, building into a crescendo before the strings stilled, offering a brief respite as the players shuffled through the music sheets. Agatha led Rio onto the parquet floor just as the first notes of a simplified waltz filled the air, a piece designed for people pretending they knew how to dance.</p><p>Agatha did know.</p><p>And for the first time in her life, she was grateful for the hours spent swaying on the dancefloor in uncomfortable shoes with her mother pointing out her every mistake because the moment Rio's hand settled in hers, and her other rested lightly on Agatha's shoulder, her mind stammered.</p><p>They began to move, slow and measured, each step almost too effortless for their first dance together.</p><p>Agatha's heels clicked against the polished floor as they turned, the crowd blurring into a wash of color, perfume, and polished smiles. But Agatha wasn't watching them anymore.</p><p>Rio's dark eyes gleamed in the warm light, two pools of brown filled with so much trust that Agatha suspected she could lead the woman off a cliff and Rio would simply accept it.</p><p><em>Just a performance. Just a part of the deal</em>.</p><p>It didn't feel like it. Not when Rio's fingers curled slightly in hers, not tight, not tentative, just <em>there,</em> and Agatha felt it all the way down her spine. The warmth of her palm. The closeness of her body. The faintest floral trace of her perfume, something soft though earthy, not overly expensive, so inherently Rio.</p><p>Agatha guided her through a slow turn, catching the moment Rio's eyes darted to her lips before flicking away again.</p><p>It must've been the light. It had to be.</p><p>They were surrounded by people who thought they were in love. People who expected smiles and soft touches, and intimate glances. Rio was a phenomenal actress as well, aware of the message the dance should send. They had to keep the act up, had to convince everyone this was <em>real</em>.</p><p>Agatha shifted a little closer, letting the hand on Rio's waist rest a fraction lower, her thumb tracing a barely-there motion against the smooth fabric of her dress.</p><p>Rio looked up at her with that same easy smile, as if she truly believed this was just a game. As if none of it mattered.</p><p>Agatha's throat was dry.</p><p>"I thought you didn't like dancing at these things," Rio murmured, her breath hitting Agatha's cheek.</p><p>Jesus, they were so close.</p><p>"I don't," Agatha said quietly. "But you make it tolerable."</p><p>Her voice came out lower than intended, warmer. Something vulnerable threatened to slip past the edges, but Rio didn't notice. Or maybe she did, but chose not to say anything.</p><p>Agatha turned them again, slower this time. She let the moment linger like the notes of a song that should've ended by now. But it didn't. It kept going, impossibly delicate.</p><p>So did the lie.</p><p>So did she.</p><p>Just one more step, one more spin, one more second pretending it didn't feel real.</p><p>The music began to taper, the violins growing softer and more distant, signaling the end.</p><p>Couples around them slowed, breaking apart with the subtle choreography of a practiced crowd, a smile here, a murmur there, hands falling away like petals from a stem.</p><p>But Agatha held on a second longer than she needed to, not long enough to be noticeable but just to feel it.</p><p>Rio's breath was even, her hand still resting gently against Agatha's shoulder. She looked up, her eyes wide with something unreadable, and so, so <em>warm</em>.</p><p>Agatha had to remind herself to breathe.</p><p>"You're a good lead," Rio said, too soft for teasing.</p><p>Agatha's mouth curved into something halfway between a smile and a defense mechanism. "I'll make sure to tell my mother that."</p><p>She tried to let go then - really, she did - but Rio's fingers caught her hand for just a second longer, an unconscious reflex. Like neither of them quite wanted to leave the moment behind.</p><p>Agatha's heart stuttered.</p><p>Then Rio stepped back, brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "I didn't take Evanora for someone who let a woman learn how to lead."</p><p>"She was strongly opposed," Agatha admitted, pulse still thumping in her temples. "But has that ever stopped me before?"</p><p>The orchestra shifted, notes rising again with a new rhythm. Another song. Another chance. Around them, dancers began to gather once more.</p><p>They could do one more, right?</p><p>It wouldn't be strange to ask again.</p><p>Agatha turned, readying herself to offer her hand-</p><p>"Rio!"</p><p>Billy's voice cut through the moment, bright and unbothered, slicing through Agatha's thoughts.</p><p>She stiffened, irritation curling sharply under her ribs. Why the fuck was he here? Since when were assistants invited?</p><p>But Rio lit up, her whole face changing at the sound of his voice. "Billy, hi!"</p><p>He approached with his usual bounce, suit crisp but worn like a borrowed costume. He had the energy of someone who'd found the wrong door to the right party and decided to stay anyway.</p><p>"Mrs. Harkness," he said brightly, giving Agatha an appreciative once-over. "You two look amazing together."</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, voice flat. "Not an appropriate comment to make to your boss, Teen."</p><p>Rio shot her a side glance, eyebrows raised, before smoothing things over with practiced ease. "What she means is <em>thank you</em>."</p><p>"Where's Eddie?" she added, scanning the room.</p><p>Billy jerked a thumb toward the bar, his mouth twisting. "Cornered by some finance guy from his firm. They're talking about... numbers? I stopped listening once someone said <em>diversify your portfolio</em>," he turned back to Rio with a grin. "Figured I'd find you before I expired from boredom, and then I saw you two on the floor, absolutely obliterating everyone else's dignity."</p><p>Rio laughed, light and real, and Agatha hated how much it tugged at something deep in her chest.</p><p>"It was all her," Rio nodded at her with a smile so bright it should be illegal. "She's <em>scarily</em> good at this."</p><p>Agatha shifted her weight, trying not to let it show. She wasn't used to praise. It made her feel uncomfortable, especially when genuine. She should have made a joke. Deflected. Instead, she just stood there, still as a statue.</p><p>Billy turned to her, clearly oblivious to the tension cracking just beneath the surface. "You're full of surprises, Mrs. Harkness."</p><p>"Don't get used to it," Agatha muttered. It came out more tired than sharp, the edge dulled by something she didn't want to name. Her gaze swept the room, looking for a lifeline.</p><p>She needed distance. Breathing room. A moment to slip back into herself, away from the ghost of a dance and the weight of something unspoken clinging to her skin.</p><p>A familiar face caught her eye. One of her newer clients, conveniently waving a drink and radiating small talk energy. Perfect.</p><p>"I should do some networking," she said abruptly, already angling her body away. She barely looked at Rio when she added, "You good here?"</p><p>Rio blinked, eyebrows lifting at the shift in tone. Whatever softness Agatha's voice had was gone, replaced by the usual cool detachment.</p><p>"I- yeah. Sure."</p><p>"I'll find you later," Agatha tossed over her shoulder, already moving, heels tapping against the wood as she disappeared into the crowd without looking back.</p><p>The rapid exit didn't free her of the moment, though. It kept clinging to the back of her blazer like perfume or smoke that didn't wash off easily, even as her face reset itself into a collected mask. She made eye contact with the client, a man with too much cologne and a handshake that lingered a beat too long.</p><p>He had to do.</p><p>She smiled, crisp and professional, and started the conversation like she hadn't just been seconds away from... what? Something dangerous. Something <em>soft</em>.</p><p>She couldn't afford soft.</p><p>Especially not with Rio.</p><p>"She's beautiful," the client said, unprompted, eyes flicking in the direction she'd just come from.</p><p>Agatha didn't flinch.</p><p>"She is," she agreed coolly. "And terrifyingly smart. Taking her anywhere usually ends with job offers or marriage proposals."</p><p>The client laughed, and she smiled again, hollow and practiced. Her attention drifted as he spoke about some investment, dressed in a polite yet boastful tone.</p><p>Agatha nodded, talked, and smiled in the right places, but her mind was still on the dancefloor. Still two songs back, when Rio's hand had fit into hers like a secret they weren't ready to tell.</p><p>She hated it.</p><p>Hated that she wanted to look back. Hated that she wanted to know if Rio was watching her. If she'd noticed the shift. If she felt it too.</p><p>Agatha took a sip of champagne she didn't want, letting it burn on the way down.</p><p>This was the deal they'd made. A fake marriage, a perfect lie.</p><p>Nothing more.</p><p>She could feel the weight of her wedding ring on her hand like it was mocking her.</p><p>The conversation bled on. She heard the client’s voice in pieces - phrases about quarterly growth and competitive edge - but it was all background noise. Muffled. Like someone had dropped her underwater and left her there to smile through the surface.</p><p>She nodded again, excused herself with a promise to <em>circle back</em>, and moved toward the edge of the ballroom.</p><p>Her moment of peace didn't last for two seconds before Lilia and Jen materialized around her, their blurry reflections crowding her in the tall window she was facing.</p><p>"Great speech, Lilia," she said, keeping her voice even. "I lasted almost two full sentences before zoning out."</p><p>Lilia laughed, unfazed by the sarcasm. "Thank you. I hope you committed those lines to memory. It's your turn next year."</p><p>Agatha hummed, tracing the string lights outside with her eyes. "I'll fake an emergency."</p><p>"I'll have Rio bring you."</p><p>The words felt like a punch in the gut, but Agatha powered through the blinding pain with a tight-lipped smile that looked more like a scowl. "She won't be here next year."</p><p>It was imprecise, but her friends were lawyers accustomed to reading between the lines.</p><p>
<em>She won't be my wife in a year.</em>
</p><p>Agatha kept her eyes on the lights, fingers folding neatly around the base of her glass. She wasn't sure what to make of the faint ache pressing against her ribs. It wasn't new, but it was getting harder to ignore.</p><p>"You can still bring her," Jen said after a pause. "This is the longest you've lasted on one of those things."</p><p>"And the only time I saw you genuinely enjoy dancing," Lilia added softly.</p><p>"That wasn't real," Agatha replied, tone flat. "None of it is."</p><p>It was the kind of line that should have closed a conversation, but it didn't. Jen just tilted her head, studying her. "Isn't it?"</p><p>Agatha didn't give her the satisfaction of an answer.</p><p>"I need air," she muttered, walking away without waiting for a reply.</p><p>She didn't hear Lilia or Jen follow. And that was good.</p><p>Because when she stepped out onto the patio, the brisk air was almost enough to clear her mind.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>The sharp bite of the evening wind slithered under her blazer, grazing her collarbones and cutting through the heat still lingering on her skin from the dance. She welcomed it - <em>needed </em>it - like a slap on the face. Like something that could shock her back into sense.</p><p>She moved toward the marble railing unhurriedly, each step calculated like grace was the only armor she had left. The string lights twinkled in the lush garden, mapping out the paths like the arrows leading to an emergency exit.</p><p>Agatha set her glass down on the ledge with a soft clink, fingers curling loosely around the delicate stem. The crystal was cool, smooth, and utterly unhelpful.</p><p>Blaming everything on alcohol would be so easy.</p><p>It was a built-in excuse, the kind that slipped easily off her tongue in the morning after's half-light. Much like after her birthday, she could write everything off - say the champagne got to her, that the pressurized evening and the strain of pretending finally cracked something.</p><p>That the way her fingers dug into Rio's hip had meant nothing.</p><p>That the softness in her voice was just an echo of the music.</p><p>That the way she held on at the end of the song was muscle memory.</p><p>She could swear off drinking around Rio. Laugh about it later.</p><p>But she wasn't even <em>buzzed</em>.</p><p>Three glasses, carefully spaced out and light enough to keep her thoughts knife-sharp.</p><p>No excuse.</p><p>The worst part was knowing that nothing about tonight had been accidental. She hadn't stumbled into softness. She'd chosen it. Allowed it. <em>Leaned into it.</em></p><p>Like a fucking fool.</p><p>Because something in her had cracked open the second Rio’s hand slid into hers, warm and steady. And the way Rio looked at her - like she saw right through the mask and liked what was underneath - had set something loose in Agatha she didn’t know how to name.</p><p>She wasn’t built for this kind of ache. This slow unraveling.</p><p>And yet here she was, standing out on the patio like she needed distance to keep herself intact. Like she couldn’t trust herself not to ask for one more dance. One more moment. One more lie that felt too good to correct.</p><p>She exhaled through her nose, steady and silent.</p><p>The door creaked open behind her.</p><p>She didn't turn, but she knew who it was before she heard the steps. Knew it from the quiet way they moved, from the instinct that curled warm and unwelcome under her skin.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Of course it was fucking Rio.</p><p>Her heels clicked softly against the stone, slowing as she approached. She didn't speak at first, just came to stand beside her, leaving a respectful space between them.</p><p>Agatha kept her eyes trained on the string lights, twinkling and unbothered as if they were laughing at her inner turmoil.</p><p>"I figured I'd find you here," Rio said after a moment, voice low. "Lilia said you looked like you were considering bolting."</p><p>Agatha's mouth twitched. "No way. I'm setting a new record."</p><p>Rio smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. She looked out at the garden, mirroring Agatha's stance. "You okay?"</p><p>"I'm fine," Agatha said automatically.</p><p>Rio didn't believe her. But she didn't push either.</p><p>The silence stretched, not uncomfortable, just... full. Brimming with things neither of them was sure how to name.</p><p>Agatha finally glanced at her out of the corner of her eye. "You didn't have to come out."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>And yet, she had.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands, still wrapped around the fragile glass, and untangled them slowly, fingers tapping against the cold marble.</p><p>The question swelled on the tip of her tongue.</p><p>Had Rio felt it too? Not just this evening, but since the dinner with Evanora? Could she sense the shift between them? Was that why she had searched for her?</p><p>"The party should've been here," Rio muttered, eyes sliding appreciatively over the well-maintained garden, each bush trimmed to perfection, every flower carefully spaced out. "It's beautiful."</p><p>Agatha forced the questions down, swallowing the bitter taste they left on her tongue.</p><p>"Too cold for the clients," she said, voice quieter than she meant. "God forbid they feel uncomfortable for a second."</p><p>Rio huffed a soft laugh. "Right. Pretentious pricks."</p><p>"I hope you didn't call anyone that after I'd left," Agatha half-joked, her tone flat.</p><p>"Not to their face. As agreed," Rio mused, leaning just a fraction closer, her face softening. "You sure you're okay? You left kinda suddenly."</p><p>Agatha felt her defenses shoot up, but something felt wrong. They felt weaker, like one more question would crumble them entirely. "I'm on the clock. Networking is required."</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, eyes still on her, not buying the excuse but respecting the space Agatha clearly needed. "Sure. I just-"</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>It startled Agatha into looking at her again. Rio rarely hesitated. She rarely <em>thought</em> before speaking.</p><p>Now, she was standing with her arms wrapped around her body to ward off the cold, her expression lost like she'd been thrown into a situation way beyond her competencies.</p><p>"The dance felt good."</p><p>That, well, <em>that </em>nearly fucking undid her.</p><p>Agatha straightened, spine stiffening as she reached for the champagne glass again, desperate to keep her hands occupied.</p><p>To stop herself from pulling Rio into her, from offering her body heat to the shivering woman.</p><p>"We're both good dancers," she deflected.</p><p>Rio exhaled softly, a small huff that wasn't quite a laugh. "That's not what I meant."</p><p>Agatha didn't reply.</p><p>She couldn't.</p><p>The words settled between them like mist, clinging to their clothes, their silence. Neither of them looked at the other, not directly - like eye contact would make it real.</p><p>A beat passed. Then two.</p><p>Agatha finally spoke, her voice low. "I'm not used to... dancing like that."</p><p>"Me neither," Rio said, and that was all.</p><p>It didn't need more.</p><p>They stood in silence, shoulder to shoulder, staring at the garden bathed in soft moonlight - trimmed hedges, clean paths, manicured flowerbeds.</p><p>"You know," Rio said eventually, almost as if she were thinking out loud, "when I first moved in, I was weirdly excited about your backyard. I think I spent more time staring at the grass than unpacking."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, a quiet shift, just enough to catch Rio's profile in her peripheral vision.</p><p>It was easier, somehow, to focus on this than on the electric thread still stretching taut between them.</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. "I know I have a lot of potted plants, but I always wanted to grow more than just what fits in a pot. Herbs, tomatoes, maybe squash if I'm feeling ambitious."</p><p>Agatha looked back out, lips tugging into something caught between fondness and resignation. "You've already started claiming corners. The gardener mentioned a mysterious rosemary bush near the back gate."</p><p>"Narc," Rio grumbled, mock-serious. "Here I thought we bonded over soil and fertilizers while he was reporting back to you."</p><p>Agatha huffed a small laugh. "For all its worth, he seemed happy to have somebody who cares about that kind of stuff in the house. Maybe slightly afraid you'll steal his job."</p><p>Rio drummed her fingers against the marble, shaking her head. "I'd never. Somebody has to take care of the rosemary after I move out."</p><p>Agatha ignored the unease curling between her ribs at the comment. "It's not my fault plants die out of spite."</p><p>"They just need attention," Rio said. Then, quieter, she added, "Not everything thrives on distance."</p><p>Agatha's fingers tightened slightly on the glass, the weight of the words landing somewhere in her stomach.</p><p>"You can do what you want with it," she said after a beat. "The garden."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Fuck, the excitement in Rio's voice made her feel stupid for not offering earlier.</p><p>"You already are," Agatha muttered. "Might as well go all in."</p><p>Rio smiled like a child in a candy store, her eyes shining. "I promise not to turn it into a jungle."</p><p>Agatha nodded, her throat tighter than she'd like. "I'll tell the gardener to cut down any lianas on sight. I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to strangle me in my sleep."</p><p>"Dramatic," Rio laughed, bumping their shoulders together. "I can run everything by you, not a single seed planted without your approval."</p><p>"No need," Agatha breathed out. "I trust you."</p><p>Rio stilled beside her, the subtle hitch of her breath cutting through the silence like a startling gunshot. She didn't say anything right away. Just looked at Agatha, not with amusement or teasing, but with something steadier. Something like awe.</p><p>"You trust me," Rio echoed carefully, surprise lacing her voice.</p><p>To her credit, Agatha was just as startled by the admission.</p><p>The realization struck with a quiet but seismic force, reverberating through her chest like the aftermath of dropped glass. She could almost hear it, the pieces falling into place with a deafening, inevitable click.</p><p>That was it. The shift.</p><p>The elusive thread that had been tugging at the seams of their every conversation since the dinner with Evanora. The thing that lingered in the charged silences and wrapped itself around every touch, every glance that lasted a second too long.</p><p>
<em>Trust.</em>
</p><p>Not the calculated, conditional kind she extended to colleagues or clients, but something quieter. The kind that crept in unnoticed, like water through cracks, until she was already soaked through.</p><p>She had given it to Rio slowly, incrementally. A crumb at a time. Letting her cook dinner. Letting her stay with Nicky, even when the stakes felt too high. Letting her fix things - like that stupid front porch railing - without protest or second-guessing. Each moment was small enough to ignore on its own, but together, they formed a pattern. A quiet surrender.</p><p>And then, without even realizing it, Agatha had handed over the whole damn thing.</p><p>She'd watched Rio sit in front of Evanora like a shield, catching every backhanded comment, every thinly veiled insult with calm, deadly precision. Not for show or credit, but because - for some reason - defending Agatha's dignity had become non-negotiable. Because Rio had drawn a line in the sand, planted her feet, and decided that Evanora would not cross it. Not if she could do anything about it.</p><p>That was the moment, Agatha realized. The silent transition from holding her breath around Rio to exhaling deeply whenever she was around.</p><p>The moment everything had shifted.</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly, feeling Rio's eyes on her, honest and soft like she knew what the realization had done to her.</p><p>How it had <em>ruined</em> her.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness didn't <em>trust</em> people. Not without knowing them for years. Not without making them prove they were worth it over and over again.</p><p>And yet, something about Rio made it almost easy. Effortless.</p><p>Agatha's tongue flexed uncomfortably in her mouth as she shifted her grip on the champagne glass again, eyes falling away from Rio to stare at the garden. "Don't let it go to your head," she said dryly, but her voice lacked its usual bite.</p><p>Rio didn't smirk. She didn't press. She just tilted her head a little like she was still parsing the moment, still letting it settle between them.</p><p>"I won't," she said, soft and certain.</p><p>And somehow, Agatha knew she meant it.</p><p>Then, Rio shivered, abruptly and violently like she had been fighting it for a while now, and Agatha immediately pushed away from the railing, flicking her wrist toward the door. "Let's grab our coats and get out of here. We've already stayed longer than necessary."</p><p>The moment fell apart around them, but the shards embedded deep in Agatha's skin.</p><p>Rio simply nodded, sending the garden one last glance as if saying goodbye before following her back inside.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Whoever decided to organize the gala on a Saturday deserved a raise. Or a promotion. Or both.</p><p>Either way, they were currently Agatha's new favorite person.</p><p>Because after Saturday came Sunday. And Sundays meant soccer games - early alarms, a chaotic scramble out the door by nine-thirty, and hours spent on uncomfortable plastic chairs, surrounded by overzealous parents and overpriced concession stand coffee.</p><p>But most importantly, it meant getting out of the house.</p><p>Long before Rio could saunter down the stairs and waltz - <em>walk</em> - into the kitchen with that barely-there look on her face and hair still tousled from sleep.</p><p>Agatha had never been more grateful for youth soccer in her life.</p><p>Because the alternative? The alternative was staying home, trapped with Rio and the echo of last night.</p><p>The echo that, despite her best efforts, had followed her out of the ballroom, into the car, and all the way home.</p><p>I hadn't faded. Not after the needlessly long shower. Not while she changed into pajamas with trembling fingers. And certainly not when she lay awake, rigid beneath her sheets, staring at the ceiling like it might offer an answer.</p><p>Her mind kept drifting back to the way Rio's hand had settled in hers. To the soft laugh that escaped her lips when Agatha had muttered some dry comment about one of the speeches. To the warmth of her breath ghosting over Agatha's ear when she leaned in just a little too close to whisper her own observation, like the two of them were sharing some delicious secret.</p><p>The moments looped endlessly, her body still tingling with the memory of Rio's touch, the scent of her perfume, the way everything had felt <em>lighter</em>.</p><p>And that? That was unacceptable.</p><p>She couldn't blame the champagne - three glasses weren't remotely enough to make for a plausible excuse.</p><p>She couldn't blame Rio either. The woman had done absolutely nothing wrong. She hadn't crossed any lines, hadn't done anything <em>different</em>.</p><p>Which left only one explanation: the dry spell.</p><p>Touch-starved after months of celibacy from before the arrangement, emotionally compromised by the weird shift between them, and biologically cornered by the fact that Rio was, objectively, beautiful.</p><p>Agatha was only human. She was allowed to be a little <em>off</em> about it.</p><p>That didn't mean anything.</p><p>The tingling from feeling Rio's body pressed against hers as they danced? That had been a simple reflex, her nerves coming back online after being dormant for too long. It didn't mean anything.</p><p>The way her stomach twisted when Hela eyed Rio like she was something to own? That was feminism, rage on behalf of a fellow woman. It didn't mean anything.</p><p>And the trust, well, that was <em>natural</em>, a byproduct of circumstance. They'd been living together for over a month. Shared space, routines, the occasional crisis - of course, that built <em>some</em> level of trust. That was inevitable.</p><p>Still, it <em>didn't mean anything</em>.</p><p>It couldn't.</p><p>Which was exactly why some space was necessary. A little distance to clear her head, to get her bearings. Just until she could rein everything back in and lock it in tiny boxes at the back of her mind.</p><p>Attraction, she could handle. She could stifle it down, using the contract as a fire extinguisher for the sizzling sparks of desire prickling at her skin whenever Rio touched her. Then, she would wait it out, maybe a little miserable, but keeping her professional integrity intact. It wouldn't be the first time she had to put logic above her desires.</p><p>But softness?</p><p>Softness was dangerous.</p><p>Because combined with attraction, it resembled something perilously close to <em>wanting</em>, not just in her bed but in her life.</p><p>It resembled wanting to see Rio curled up on her couch every night, arms open and inviting her to join.</p><p>It resembled wanting to return home to soft music and Nicky's excited chatter in the kitchen as Rio cooked dinner.</p><p>It resembled, well, longing for a <em>relationship.</em></p><p>Thankfully, she didn't want any of that. She <em>never</em> wanted any of that and would not start now, at the worst possible time, with the one person who was off limits.</p><p>With the thought planted firmly at the front of her mind, Agatha made her way toward the bleachers, watching Nicky make a beeline for the twins already warming up on the sidelines.</p><p>The sun was too bright, the air smelled vaguely of turf and cheap deodorant, and the steady hum of conversations between the parents had her regretting every choice that had led her to an underfunded community park at 9:30 a.m. on a Sunday.</p><p>But it was better than being at home.</p><p>She noticed Wanda immediately, her red hair standing out in the sea of blondes and brunettes like a sore thumb, and slowly walked over to the empty seat on her friend's left, feet dragging against the gravel.</p><p>"Hey," Wanda said casually, taking a long sip from her thermos - coffee so diluted with sweeteners and milk that it should be a criminal offense if Agatha remembered correctly. "You're here early."</p><p>Agatha slid onto the hard plastic seat with a sigh, adjusting her glasses and blinking against the early morning glare. "Nicky was excited," she grumbled, nodding at the man on Wanda's other side. "Hi, Vision."</p><p>"Hello, Agatha," he muttered gently as if he could already sense the inevitable and pitied Agatha's fate.</p><p>Then, almost on cue, Wanda smiled. A little too bright, a little too <em>curious</em>.</p><p>"So," she started innocently, tapping her fingers against the thermos, "how was the gala?"</p><p>"Full of pretentious pricks," Agatha replied, her eyes glued to the field where the teams were still warming up. "And boring. As usual."</p><p>Wanda quirked an eyebrow, studying her with amusement. "Really? Because you look like you haven't slept much."</p><p>"Gee, thanks," Agatha scoffed, glancing at Vision. "You got yourself a real charmer."</p><p>Vision held back a smile but didn't comment, probably unwilling to get roped into whatever back-and-forth would happen next.</p><p>A smart man. Agatha had to give him that.</p><p>"I'm just saying," Wanda pressed, maintaining her innocent tone. "It was your debut as a married woman. Something interesting must've happened."</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips into a thin line, considering finding an empty seat away from her friend and her stupid questions.</p><p>Deciding that it would be too much of a hassle - and could potentially lead to an unwanted conversation with another parent - she turned to face Wanda with a serious look.</p><p>"You're right: something did happen," she said, lowering her voice as if to share a secret. Wanda leaned forward, her green eyes sparkling with curiosity. "When we entered, the ballroom erupted in rainbows, and the band started playing 'Born This Way' by Lady Gaga. It was magical."</p><p>Wanda blinked, then threw her head back, her laugh loud enough to attract a few other parents' attention.</p><p>"You're funny when you're deflecting," she said between giggles, her shoulders shaking. "But you know it's not gonna work."</p><p>"Who says I'm deflecting?" Agatha asked with a smirk, adjusting her sunglasses as if preparing for a battle. "You've been to a few of those events with Vision. The strangest shit happens there."</p><p>Vision cleared his throat quietly. "She's right. Remember that time they got an entire team of acrobats to perform?"</p><p>"Exactly," Agatha nodded. "And his firm is <em>tame</em>."</p><p>Wanda gave Vision a look, and he wisely pretended to be interested in the field where the boys were getting into positions.</p><p>"I know there was no Lady Gaga or rainbows," the redhead crossed her arms, jutting out her chin as she glared at Agatha. "And you're hiding something."</p><p>Agatha shrugged. "Aren't I always?"</p><p>Wanda didn't push further. Not yet.</p><p>Instead, she leaned back in her seat, fingers wrapping elegantly around the thermos. Her gaze lingered on Agatha for a beat longer, just enough for the message to land.</p><p>
<em>This isn't over.</em>
</p><p>And Agatha, as always, hated how easily her best friend could see through her.</p><p>So, she turned her focus back to the field, the shrill sound of the referee's whistle cutting through her thoughts, almost startling enough to make her forget about the warmth of Rio's hand in hers.</p><p>Just soccer, Nicky, and an unremarkable Sunday.</p><p>Without any lingering images of Rio smiling at her like she was something worth looking at.</p><hr/><p>For the first time since she'd started coming to Nicky's games, Agatha found herself wishing the match would never end.</p><p>Usually, the bleachers were a special kind of purgatory - too hard, too cold, and always positioned awkwardly enough to guarantee lower back pain. Most weeks, she sat stiffly with one eye on the field and the other glued to her watch, tracking the time with all the desperation of a prisoner counting down a sentence. Soccer, as far as she could tell, was mostly running, yelling, and pretending offsides weren't made up.</p><p>She swore the field existed in some cruel pocket dimension where every second stretched into a minute and every minute into an hour.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>Today, Agatha barely registered the hard plastic digging into her spine. She didn't flinch when the overly caffeinated mom two rows behind her screamed at her kid like he was up for the Premier League draft. The usual distractions were just white noise, background static to the thoughts swirling restlessly in her mind.</p><p>And then came the whistle. Long, sharp, <em>final</em>.</p><p>Game over.</p><p>Agatha tensed instinctively, dread settling across her shoulders like an unwelcome shawl. That was it. The buffer was gone. Now came the part where they packed up, got in the car, and headed home.</p><p>Back to Rio.</p><p>And she wasn't ready. Not even close.</p><p>Before she could untangle the thought, a blur of movement came barreling toward her.</p><p>"We won!" Nicky shouted, his face lit up like he'd just scored at the World Cup. The twins were right behind him, breathless and triumphant, all three grinning like they'd just conquered the universe.</p><p>Agatha managed a smile, shaky but sincere, as she reached down to straighten the strap of Nicky's back where it had twisted awkwardly across his shoulder. "I saw. You were amazing."</p><p>Tommy jumped in immediately, practically vibrating with adrenaline. "Did you see the pass I made?"</p><p>Billy cut in without missing a beat, "And my interception after halftime?"</p><p>The three launched into a rapid-fire recap of the entire game, each detail more chaotic than the last. It didn't matter that she'd seen it all. It didn't matter that half the game was a blur of identical jerseys and shouting.</p><p>Agatha listened, nodded, and interjected with the occasional 'wow' or 'no way', clinging to every second like it was a lifeline.</p><p>"You play like a pro," she said to Nicky, brushing a strand of sweaty hair off his forehead. "They didn't stand a chance."</p><p>Her son beamed. The field buzzed with post-game chatter. Beside her, Wanda chuckled, her body angled toward the twins, but her eyes trained on Agatha with a knowing look.</p><p>Even though she hadn't said so out loud, Wanda had noticed how the usual rush to escape the cursed bleachers had vanished, replaced by a strange hesitation, a quiet, lingering dread that Agatha wasn't quick enough to mask.</p><p>Agatha could feel it in the air between them.</p><p>Wanda didn't push, but the slight tilt of her head and the too-casual smile tugging at her lips said enough: she'd seen it. She was waiting.</p><p>Agatha gulped, realizing with a quiet kind of horror that the longer she lingered, the more obvious she became. She had to choose: usher Nicky toward the car and start the short drive back to a house that suddenly felt like enemy territory, or stay here and let Wanda's radar ping harder and faster with every second of avoidance.</p><p>Before she could decide, Wanda did it for her, opting for a secret, third option that somehow made everything worse and better at once.</p><p>"Well," Wanda announced brightly, rising from her seat with a dramatic stretch, "I think a victory like this deserves some pizza. Wouldn't you agree?"</p><p>She didn't look at Agatha. Not directly. Just enough of a glance to make it clear the offer wasn't a suggestion but a lifeline.</p><p>And when the boys erupted into cheers, jumping and spinning like they'd won a second game, Agatha found herself nodding, the decision taken out of her hands.</p><p>"Pizza," Tommy chanted like it was a holy word, already skipping down the bleachers.</p><p>"Can we get the one with jalapeno?" Nicky asked, too happy to notice the tension still coiled beneath his mother's skin.</p><p>Agatha sighed, her feet moving mechanically against the gravel. "Sounds great," she said distractedly.</p><p>Wanda's smile softened, her voice low as she leaned in. "We'll order in. Drive to our house."</p><p>Agatha didn't respond, aware of what it meant.</p><p>Wanda's house offered privacy, the kind they wouldn't find at the nearest pizza joint or the soccer field. There would be no hiding behind the possibility of strangers overhearing their conversation or convenient distractions. Only a soft couch, the smell of pizza, and Wanda. Patient, annoyingly perceptive Wanda.</p><p>She would wait until the kids were busy and until Vision, with his impeccable emotional radar, offered some flimsy excuse to slip out of the room with a glance and a nod.</p><p>Then she'd start asking. And Agatha would be cornered.</p><p>Still, it was better than going home.</p><p>So, Agatha followed Nicky off the field, chasing the sound of his excited chatter and clinging to the short reprieve like it might stretch long enough to breathe.</p><p>It didn't.</p><p>The reprieve lasted exactly the two minutes it took Agatha to steer the car out of the parking lot and back onto the main road.</p><p>Then, just as she started to exhale, Nicky stirred in his seat, gripping his seatbelt and leaning forward with that bright, bouncy energy only a ten-year-old could summon before noon on a Sunday.</p><p>"Did you know Rio used to play soccer?" he asked, eyes wide with delight.</p><p>The question hit her like a punch to the chest. It was so unexpected that Agatha nearly rear-ended Vision's Skoda Karoq, her foot slamming onto the brake just in time. The car jolted, and she caught Vision's startled expression in the rearview mirror, but he quickly looked away, likely afraid she'd take offense and press harder on the gas out of spite.</p><p>Once again - smart man.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, doing her best to sound unfazed. "Yeah, I knew that."</p><p>It was one of the first things she had learned about Rio, thrown at her at the bar the night they met. The night Rio had taken it upon herself to convince Agatha to marry her by feeding her useless facts about her life.</p><p>And Agatha still fucking remembered each of those useless facts. She still had them tucked away in that drawer in her mind that had, at some point, stopped being labeled "possibly insane bartender", and now sported a polished little plaque that read: "Rio Vidal."</p><p>And the worst part?</p><p>She kept adding to the drawer, transforming it into an entire file cabinet.</p><p>Favorite color? Green. The deep kind, like pine needles or dark wine bottles.</p><p>Guilty pleasure? Stupid documentaries about shark migrations or dinosaurs because, apparently, Rio was a five-year-old boy in disguise.</p><p>Biggest pet peeve? People stopping in the middle of the sidewalk because, quote, "How the fuck can you go through life without any kind of spacial awareness?"</p><p>Useless. And yet, Agatha's traitorous brain cataloged each fact like she was prepping for a trivia night that would never come.</p><p>"She said she played until high school," Nicky added, pulling her back to the present. "But she did something to her knee and had to stop."</p><p>And fuck, Agatha knew that too. Not because Rio had told her, but because she had <em>noticed</em> - noticed how Rio would sometimes walk with the slightest limp on damp days, how she would try to keep from bending her right knee too much after a long shift.</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly, fingers tightening around the wheel. "That sounds terrible."</p><p>"Yeah," Nicky nodded solemnly as if mourning Rio's career as a professional soccer player. "Can we invite her to my next game?"</p><p>Well, she probably should've expected that. The equation was pretty simple: Rio liked soccer and Nicky, and Nicky adored Rio and soccer. If anything, Agatha should be surprised it had taken her son over a month to solve for X.</p><p>It didn't make the result any less daunting.</p><p>"I don't know, baby," Agatha said slowly, mentally flipping through excuses like flashcards. She needed a reason, something watertight, something better than <em>I'm spiraling because your fake stepmom danced with me for one song, and now I don't know what to do with myself</em>.</p><p>The list was short.</p><p>"Rio usually works late on Saturdays," she offered weakly. "She's still asleep when we leave."</p><p>"She'd get up earlier for me," Nicky replied without missing a beat.</p><p>And the worst part was he was <em>right</em>.</p><p>Rio would.</p><p>Agatha didn't even need to ask. If Nicky invited her to a game, Rio would be up, showered, and probably waiting by the front door in a jersey with one of those dumb foldable chairs before Agatha even got out of bed.</p><p>And that made everything worse.</p><p>Because Agatha was still a mess of tangled nerves and quiet panic from last night. Because she had deliberately chosen interrogation over returning home to avoid Rio, and now her son wanted to stitch the woman directly into another part of their life.</p><p>Agatha blinked hard at the road ahead, jaw tense.</p><p>It was not a fight she could win.</p><p>"You'll have to ask her," she finally said, feeling like a martyr.</p><p>Nicky's grin was almost worth the inner turmoil. Almost.</p><p>They pulled up to Wanda and Vision's house ten minutes later, the boys tumbling out like overeager puppies, racing for the door while Vision trailed behind with the calm dignity of someone used to chaos.</p><p>Agatha lingered by the driver's side door, letting the spring sun warm her shoulders, hoping it would melt away the knot twisting tighter in her gut.</p><p>Wanda appeared beside her a second later, her tone deceptively light. "I half-expected you to bolt."</p><p>"You promised pizza," Agatha said as if the food was the only reason she hadn't returned home right after the game.</p><p>Wanda hummed, patting her shoulder with the gentleness of someone who already knew <em>exactly</em> what kind of spiral her best friend was in. Then, she turned and headed toward the house, her pace unhurried, her posture the very picture of casual.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</p><p>It was a trap; she had known that much the moment she agreed to the detour.</p><p>The conversation was waiting behind the door, crouched low and patient like a lion in the tall grass. Wanda would give her just enough time before pouncing.</p><p>Agatha sighed, muttering to herself as she followed. "Should've rear-ended the fucking Skoda."</p><hr/><p>To her mild surprise, Wanda didn't start the interrogation immediately.</p><p>She didn't pounce when they stepped inside the house and kicked off their shoes at the door. Didn't bring up Rio over slices of greasy, glorious pepperoni. Didn't so much as <em>glance</em> her way when the boys announced they were headed to the backyard to practice penalty shots, probably for the next three hours straight.</p><p>No, Wanda waited.</p><p>She waited until the house had quieted. Until Vision disappeared into his office, the living room grew cozy enough that Agatha dared to believe she was in the clear.</p><p>Then came the coffee.</p><p>Pressed into her hands with suspicious gentleness. Black, unsweetened, and hot, just as Agatha liked it.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes again.</p><p>"Oh, come on," Wanda said, plopping down beside her on the couch with a smile that was far too innocent. "Don't look at me like I laced it with truth serum."</p><p>"It wouldn't work," Agatha bit back, blowing on the steaming liquid. "I'd power through the effects out of sheer spite."</p><p>Wanda leaned back, raising her own cup to her lips. "So?"</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"<em>So.</em>" Wanda angled her body toward her, legs tucked up, voice low and patient. "Are you gonna tell me what happened, or do you want to play the guessing game?"</p><p>Agatha took a long sip, the roof of her mouth protesting at the hot temperature. She ignored the burn. "Is there an option where you drop this and let me enjoy my coffee in peace?"</p><p>"That version expired this week," Wanda answered easily.</p><p>"I want to buy the premium upgrade."</p><p>"Your card got declined."</p><p>"I haven't even swiped it yet!"</p><p>Wanda didn't miss a beat. "Preemptive rejection."</p><p>Agatha groaned, flopping back against the cushions with the theatrics of someone who knew the battle was lost. Apparently, the day was one of lost battles, bruised egos, and confusing feelings.</p><p>So much for an uncomplicated Sunday.</p><p>"Come on," Wanda said softly. "You didn't want to go home after the game and flinched when Nicky mentioned Rio as if he'd asked you to live with Evanora. And you've been unusually quiet for, like, an hour. What's going on?"</p><p>"Nothing," Agatha said, too quick to sound convincing, her voice high and thin. She cleared her throat and tried again, steadier this time. "I'm fine. Everything's fine."</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, her smile turning more soft than teasing. "Agatha."</p><p>It was the tone she used on Tommy when he tried to sneak a cookie before dinner. On Vision, when he insisted he was <em>fine</em> after spending the entire day at the office without lunch.</p><p>The tone of someone calling you out without judgment. Of someone who saw the unraveling before you did.</p><p>Agatha hated that fucking tone.</p><p>"I don't flinch at Rio's name," she muttered into her mug, flinching. Wanda raised an eyebrow. "That was a shiver. It's cold here."</p><p>"Right."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the flat, skeptical tone. "I don't know why you're so invested."</p><p>"You want a list?" Wanda asked, continuing before Agatha could speak again. "Let's see... you're my best friend, that's one. Two: you showed up to the game almost thirty minutes earlier than usual, something that's <em>never</em> happened before. Three, you looked ready to jump off the bleachers when I asked about the gala, and four, Nicky talked about inviting Rio to the next game, and you almost choked on pizza."</p><p>An outstretched finger accompanied each reason, and the red paint coating Wanda's nails brought Agatha thoughts of claws dripping in blood.</p><p>Then, true to the metaphor, Wanda went for the jugular.</p><p>"She got to you."</p><p>It wasn't a question, but a firm statement like Rio's hold on her was apparent.</p><p>Agatha bristled, her hold on the mug tightening. "No one <em>got to me</em>."</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. "So you're brooding and avoiding your house because... you're passionate about youth soccer now? You don't even know what an offside is."</p><p>"Not everyone is married to a Brit obsessed with dudes kicking a ball around," Agatha snapped.</p><p>"From what Nicky said, your <em>wife</em> could give Vis a run for his money."</p><p>Agatha flinched again, and Wanda's expression softened. "Ags, I've known you for years, and..."</p><p>The hesitation made Agatha huff impatiently. "And?"</p><p>"And I've never seen you like this."</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched, the sound sharp and unintentional. She looked away as if staring at the living room wall hard enough might force Wanda to vanish from beside her. No such luck.</p><p>"I don't know what you mean," she said, but the words came out hollow.</p><p>Wanda sipped her coffee, eyes thoughtful like she was choosing her next words with the carefulness of a person walking through a minefield.</p><p>"I've seen you furious," she began, her voice calm. "Worried. Exhausted. Soft, usually with the boys. But never... this."</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. "What's <em>this</em>?"</p><p>"Lost."</p><p>Agatha swallowed around the tightness in her throat, forcing a short laugh. "You've seen me lost multiple times. Case in point: the day I found out about the will."</p><p>"No," Wanda said quietly. "You were angry, sure. Upset? Absolutely. But Evanora's been throwing punches your entire life, and that one wasn't any different from the rest. It left you bitter but not lost."</p><p>Agatha didn't answer right away.</p><p>Her fingers curled tighter around the sturdy mug like it could anchor her, but it was just ceramic. Useless, like half the lies she kept telling herself.</p><p>"You've always known how to navigate chaos," Wanda went on, softer now. "Even if it's messy, even if you scream the whole way through, you always have a plan."</p><p>Agatha thought back to when she found out she was pregnant.</p><p>She had been a lawyer for four years by then, climbing the ranks with disciplined precision. The path to partnership had been straight and narrow, paved with long nights, airtight cases, and the sheer willpower to prove Evanora wrong.</p><p>Her life had structure, a rhythm dictated by court dates and billable hours.</p><p>Then came one dinner too many with her mother and one comment too far.</p><p>Evanora had looked at her over the rim of her crystal glass with a smirk that could be mistaken for affection if not for the steely look in her eyes. "Do you think you're winning by pretending to be something you're not? No, Agatha, you're just making yourself unlovable, a freak no man will want once you abandon your silly quest of making my life difficult. You're only proving me right."</p><p>The words had landed like a slap, and Agatha - humiliated, furious, aching - had walked out before the main course even arrived.</p><p>She hadn't planned to end the night in a bar, hadn't meant to let some cocky, forgettable man buy her a drink, smiling at her like she made sense.</p><p>But something inside her had cracked wide open, and suddenly, proving her mother wrong, or worse, proving her right, felt like a battle she needed to win <em>that night</em>, even in the worst possible way.</p><p>A few weeks later, she sat on the bathroom floor of her apartment with her knees pulled up to her chest and a pregnancy test clenched between shaking fingers. Two pink lines stared back at her, unfazed by the tears spilling down her cheeks.</p><p>She remembered laughing, a broken, hollow sound bouncing off the tiled walls. Because, somehow, she'd managed to blow up her entire life while trying to convince herself she had any control over it.</p><p>For the briefest moment, there was no plan. Just a terrifying, gaping future Agatha hadn't prepared for.</p><p>But once she had gotten up from the floor and wiped her face, she started figuring it out - one impossible step at a time.</p><p>How could this feel so much harder? Why did the thought of Rio feel more terrifying than the moment her entire life had derailed?</p><p>Agatha ran her tongue over her dried lips, exhaling slowly.</p><p>"I need a plan," she said, her voice steadier than she felt. "A way to navigate this."</p><p>Wanda studied her for a moment. "I can help with that," she offered sincerely. "But you need to talk to me."</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, bracing herself for the words simmering on her tongue. "I'm attracted to her."</p><p>She expected a dramatic gasp or a small intake of breath, at least. But Wanda merely nodded, clearly waiting for her to elaborate. When the silence stretched for a full minute, she pressed gently. "And?"</p><p>Agatha frowned. "What do you mean by 'and'? That's it."</p><p>Wanda looked at her, her expression somewhere between confusion and exasperation. "That's why you're spiraling?"</p><p>The disbelief lacing her best friend's voice felt like a personal attack. Wanda could see through the bullshit, they both knew it, but Agatha wasn't admitting anything out loud. Not when even thinking about it made her skin crawl and her breath stutter.</p><p>"Spiraling is a bit strong," Agatha bit out, lifting the mug to her lips only to realize it was empty. She set it down on the coffee table with more force than necessary, the dull clink resonating across the otherwise quiet room.</p><p>"Okay," Wanda ran a hand through her hair, exhaling slowly. "You've been married to her for over a month and realized that she was hot just now?"</p><p>"Not just now," Agatha muttered petulantly. "Yesterday."</p><p>Wanda pursed her lips like she was giving Agatha a chance to hear herself and correct course.</p><p>When Agatha just stared back at her, arms crossed and eyes daring her to say something, Wanda sighed. "And what happened yesterday?"</p><p>Agatha shifted on the couch, suddenly very interested in a loose thread on her sleeve. "The gala," she almost growled as if the event could be blamed for every bad thing that had ever happened in her life. "I thought she'd wear a suit or something, but no, she had to wear a fucking dress that showed off her arms and clung to every curve."</p><p>"Right, because you wouldn't find her attractive in a suit."</p><p>"It doesn't matter," Agatha hissed, eyes snapping to her best friend. "The point is that it's inconvenient, and I have to stop."</p><p>"You have to stop... being attracted to her?" Wanda lifted her mug and took the slowest, most judgmental sip of coffee Agatha had ever witnessed. "How exactly do you want to do that?"</p><p>"I wouldn't be fucking talking about this if I knew!" Agatha snapped, tugging at the thread hard enough to rip it off. "You're my best friend, give me advice."</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes at the demanding tone. "I would, but I can't do that if you're lying to me, and, more importantly, yourself."</p><p>Agatha scowled. "I'm not lying."</p><p>"Ags," Wanda said more gently, her mild amusement thawing. "It's not just about the dress."</p><p>"Yes, it is," she fired back, crossing her arms. "And for future reference: invalidating somebody's feelings after nagging them to talk to you isn't the greatest strategy."</p><p>Wanda didn't so much as flinch at her harsh tone. "I'm not invalidating anything. I know you're attracted to her, but you're downplaying it."</p><p>"Downplaying it?" Agatha scoffed, choosing to treat the words as a challenge. "Fine. I can tell you all about how I want to feel if her arms are as strong as they seem, trace her tattoo with my tongue, and check if-"</p><p>"You know that's not what I meant," Wanda raised her hand with the patience of a saint. "You're focusing on physical attraction because it's easier to admit."</p><p>Easier? Agatha nearly scoffed. Nothing about the physical part felt easier. It felt like falling through ice - sharp, disorienting, and humiliatingly loud.</p><p>God, she hoped the twins inherited Vision's emotional intelligence. They were doomed otherwise.</p><p>"There's nothing else to focus on," she said flatly.</p><p>Wanda raised her eyebrows, leaning forward to put her empty mug on the table with the deliberate grace of someone about to lay out undeniable evidence. Then, she settled back against the couch cushions with her hands folded neatly in her lap.</p><p>All she needed was a notepad and one of those mildly judgmental therapist smiles, and she could charge Agatha a hundred bucks an hour. Probably more.</p><p>"Remember when we went out with Lilia and Jen after you closed that big case last year?" she asked like she was flipping to Exhibit A.</p><p>Agatha blinked. "...Sure?"</p><p>"Do you remember the woman you met at the bar?"</p><p>Her frown deepened. She didn't like where this was going. "Vaguely."</p><p>"She was undressing you with her eyes from the moment we sat down. It was so obvious, Jen clocked it between ordering her drink and flirting with the bartender."</p><p>Wanda shook her head with a fond little smirk. "You ignored it for about two hours - probably out of spite because Jen kept teasing you - until the woman finally got up the nerve to walk over and ask for your number."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"And you told her you didn't need her number because you could leave with her right then and there. Which you did."</p><p>"This feels like slut shaming," Agatha muttered, raising her chin in false indignation.</p><p>"It's hard to call someone a slut when they've been celibate for months," Wanda deadpanned. "The woman gave you her number anyway. You met with her two more times. Then what happened?"</p><p>Agatha shrugged, still not seeing the point of the story. "She got clingy."</p><p>"Exactly." Wanda's eyes sparkled like she'd just dropped the winning argument in court. "That's how you are when it's just about sex. You're cool, detached, borderline smug. You flirt, ghost, and move on."</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. "And now you're making me sound like a frat boy."</p><p>"If the baseball cap fits," Wanda said sweetly.</p><p>Agatha groaned, dragging a hand down her face. "You're so annoying."</p><p>"I'm also right," Wanda shifted slightly, her tone growing gentle. "You never spiral like this over wanting to sleep with someone. You either take the woman to bed and forget about her the next morning, or decide it's not worth the trouble and ignore the pull. You don't <em>hide in my living room</em> because someone looks good in a dress."</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then closed it again. There was something uncomfortably accurate about the phrasing. She <em>was</em> spiraling. Not because Rio was attractive - that was a fact, not a crisis - but because Rio had shown up in her life like a lightning strike: unexpected, bright, and far too close to the part of her Agatha had spent half her life trying to lock away.</p><p>Wanda softened, leaning in a little. "You're lost because she makes you feel something."</p><p>"No," Agatha said quickly. "You said it yourself: I either bang the person or never see them again. But I don't have that choice here. I can't sleep with her. I can't avoid her because I <em>live with her</em>. That's the problem. That's why I'm lost."</p><p>Wanda tilted her head. "And you think that's all it is?"</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>She could feel it again - that thrum in her chest, that restless energy every time Rio entered a room. It wasn't just attraction. It was curiosity - a need to see her, hear her, understand how she could walk easily through the walls Agatha had spent years reinforcing.</p><p>"It's simple biology," she said slowly, trying to sound convincing, but her voice broke. She tried again. "I- I haven't gotten laid in months."</p><p>Wanda sighed, clearly not buying the weak argument. "Alright," she conceded, running her hand through her hair in a gesture that screamed exasperation. "So, in short, you want to fuck your wife, but can't, and it makes you a sexually flustered mess hiding in my living room."</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. "It sounds pathetic."</p><p>"It's <em>understandable</em>," Wanda shrugged as if they were discussing the weather. "Rio's objectively hot, and you're stuck with her in close quarters. You're only human."</p><p>"Exactly," Agatha said, sitting up straighter, content that her friend was finally seeing the issue for what it was. "It's proximity. Frustration. Nothing more."</p><p>Wanda didn't argue but merely nodded. "Okay. So you're sexually frustrated, and the only solution is to either wait it out or work it out."</p><p>Agatha frowned. "I don't like either of those options."</p><p>"I know," Wanda said sympathetically. "You <em>could</em> sleep with her, but considering your living arrangement and history, it doesn't seem like a good idea."</p><p>Yeah, Agatha wasn't even touching <em>that</em> solution.</p><p>"Maybe I should try yoga again," she said after a beat. "Or sign up for a martial arts class. Punching other people sounds like something I'd enjoy."</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, an amused smirk tugging at the corners of her lips. "The last time we did yoga, you almost threw your water bottle at the instructor because her voice was annoying."</p><p>Agatha made a disgusted face. "She sounded like Minnie the Mouse. I couldn't focus on <em>finding my center</em> and <em>releasing my tension </em>with a cartoon character breathing down my neck."</p><p>"You got banned from the building," Wanda deadpanned. "And almost took me down with you."</p><p>"A true friend would've thrown the water bottle while they escorted me out," Agatha exhaled slowly, leaning back. "So, I should just... wait it out?"</p><p>"If it's simply attraction? Yeah," Wanda's tone remained perfectly neutral. "The novelty will wear off. Eventually. Then, you'll repress it, which we both know you're great at."</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly. "That's the most validating thing you've said all day."</p><p>“I give credit where it’s due,” Wanda replied smoothly, a smile in her voice.</p><p>They fell into silence. Real silence. Not the charged kind that filled the gaps between arguments, or the strained kind that trailed behind confessions. Just the quiet of two people who knew how to sit still together.</p><p>Agatha stared down at her hands. The urge to fidget was strong, but even her anxiety felt tired now.</p><p>Eventually, she muttered, “This is hell.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t pretend to argue. “Yeah. But I’m open to sitting in the pit with you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t thank her. She didn’t need to.</p><p>Wanda didn’t press or fill the silence with more questions or clever insight. She just let it settle. Let <em>her</em> settle.</p><p>Agatha still didn’t have a plan. That was the worst part.</p><p>Avoiding Rio wasn’t a solution. It was a stall tactic. And judging by the way her brain kept replaying every moment from the gala - Rio’s hand in hers, the smell of her perfume, that stupidly soft <em>smile - </em>she wasn’t stalling very effectively.</p><p>But it didn’t matter.</p><p>Because it was only attraction. Just inconvenient chemistry and unfortunate timing. Nothing she couldn’t outthink or outlast.</p><p>And since it was <em>only</em> that, there was nothing to worry about.</p><p>Not really.</p><hr/><p>They stayed well into the evening, but, eventually, Agatha had to usher Nicky into the car and drive back to the house with Wanda's knowing look following them out of the driveway.</p><p>Nicky went quiet in the backseat almost immediately, worn out by the game and whatever feral chaos the twins had roped him into. His sleepy eyes stared out the window blankly, watching the city move past them at a sloth pace as Agatha refused to press on the gas harder than necessary.</p><p>Without Nicky's chatter to distract her, Agatha cranked up the radio loud enough to make the speakers buzz. The obnoxious pop songs, endless commercials, and the DJ's fake-laughing monologues flooded the car, and she hummed along, content with the noise. It was good. It kept the dread from turning into something she couldn't stuff back down.</p><p>It also didn't work.</p><p>By the time she pulled into the garage and caught sight of Rio's Toyota parked neatly in its usual spot, Agatha's hands tightened reflexively on the wheel.</p><p>For a brief moment, she considered throwing the car in reverse and disappearing with Nicky on some impromptu, wildly irresponsible cross-country trip. New identities, new lives. Problem solved.</p><p>Instead, she exhaled sharply through her nose and turned off the engine.</p><p>She could do this.</p><p>Just a normal evening in a normal house with a normal, <em>painfully attractive</em> wife.</p><p>Agatha rested her forehead against the steering wheel for a moment, whispering, "I hate my life," before climbing out to shake Nicky awake.</p><p>He blinked up at her sleepily, his hand reflexively falling to the side to unbuckle the seatbelt. "Are we home?"</p><p>"Yeah," she whispered, moving back to help him out of the car. "I'll get your stuff inside. How about you go get ready for bed?"</p><p>Technically, his bedtime wasn't for another hour, but he didn't seem to care. Instead, he rubbed at his eyes, nodding tiredly. "Okay."</p><p>When he shuffled through the garage and disappeared into the house, Agatha gathered his duffel bag and the leftover food Wanda had given them before following him with her back ramrod straight.</p><p>The house was quiet when she hesitantly slid inside. She dropped her keys in the bowl by the door and glanced around warily, half-expecting Rio to leap out at her like a horror movie villain. But there was nothing - just the low hum of the dishwasher running and the faint smell of something warm and homey lingering in the air.</p><p>Agatha blinked. <em>Homey?</em></p><p>She needed to get a grip.</p><p>The sound of a door clicking shut floated down the stairs, snapping Agatha out of her unexpected stupor. She shook herself, dropping the duffel bag by the banister with a heavy thud before marching toward the kitchen, the tote bumping against her hip and the plastic containers inside rattling with every step.</p><p>Wanda always cooked enough for a small army, especially when she had guests over. It bordered on a cry for help.</p><p>When she entered the dining room to cross over to the kitchen, Agatha froze.</p><p>Rio was there, barefoot and cross-legged at the table, lost in her own little world. She wore a pair of soft joggers and a hoodie that looked about two sizes too big, the sleeves bunched up around her forearms to keep them from covering her hands, and the hood slipping halfway down her messy bun.</p><p>Three thick textbooks lay cracked open around her, surrounded by a storm of papers, highlighters, and crumpled Post-it notes. She was hunched over the table, chewing absently on the end of her pen, a faint frown of concentration tugging at her features.</p><p>She looked... normal.</p><p>Not like the force of nature that had wrecked Agatha's defenses at the gala or the gravity well that had thrown Agatha's world off-kilter.</p><p>Just a girl doing homework, sleeves too long, hair a mess, bare feet tucked onto the chair.</p><p>And somehow, <em>that</em> was worse.</p><p>Because nothing about the image should be attractive, especially not in light of how Rio had looked the night before.</p><p>And still, Agatha's breath hitched without warning, a sharp sound she couldn't bite back in time. Rio's head snapped up immediately, the frown melting away.</p><p>"Hey," she said, offering a tired but genuine smile that hit like a punch to the gut. She put her pen down, posture shifting like she was ready to talk. Like she was <em>happy </em>to see her.</p><p>Agatha clutched the tote bag tighter, the edge of a Tupperware digging into her side. She forced herself to move, inching toward the doorway with the stiff gait of someone crossing a minefield.</p><p>"Hey," she croaked back, keeping her steps slow and casual despite the budding urge to bolt out of the room.</p><p>"How was the game?" Rio asked just as Agatha walked past her, her voice tinged with genuine curiosity.</p><p>"Nicky's team won."</p><p>Despite her best judgment, Agatha glanced at Rio, mentally kicking herself for the moment of weakness a second later.</p><p>Because Rio's face lit up like a Christmas tree at the news, joy blooming across her features without hesitation, without artifice. It made her eyes seem even softer, her entire posture relaxing like she hadn't realized she'd been tense until now.</p><p>"That's amazing," Rio said, her voice almost giddy with pride as if she'd been personally invested in the outcome.</p><p>Agatha blinked, momentarily stumped by how real it was - how real <em>she</em> was - and nearly lost her footing on the hardwood floor.</p><p>"Yeah," she muttered, almost to herself. "We went to Wanda's to celebrate."</p><p>Before Rio could add anything else, she resumed her trek to the kitchen, almost throwing herself into the space like it might shield her from the warzone of her own thoughts.</p><p>Behind her, she heard the scrape of a chair shifting and the soft patter of feet.</p><p>"She gave you leftovers?" Rio called lightly, her voice sounding closer by the second.</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, clattering the tote onto the counter harder than necessary. "Of course she did."</p><p>She busied herself with pulling out the containers, lining them up mechanically, pretending she couldn't still feel Rio's presence creeping up on her like a heat wave.</p><p>A beat passed. Then another.</p><p>And just when Agatha thought she might be in the clear - that maybe Rio had turned toward the stairs instead - the woman emerged around the corner like a domestic nightmare.</p><p>"Anything I can steal?" Rio asked, leaning casually against the counter.</p><p>Agatha didn't look up, concentrating intently on folding the tote bag into a neat square. "Help yourself. A small army wouldn't eat it all."</p><p>"You underestimate my appetite," Rio mused, crossing over to inspect the containers. Her movements were unrestrained, natural, like this was their normal. Like being around each other should be <em>easy</em>.</p><p>Agatha wanted to scream. Or maybe bang her head against the fridge until her mind decided to kindly shut the fuck up.</p><p>Instead, she wordlessly shoved a Tupperware toward Rio and yanked open the silverware drawer, needing something, <em>anything</em> to do with her hands.</p><p>"Thanks," Rio said, her fingers brushing lightly against Agatha's when she took the container.</p><p>It was a featherlight touch - accidental and forgettable.</p><p>Agatha still felt it burn all the way up her arm and lodge itself behind her ribs.</p><p>She didn't say anything else. She couldn't.</p><p>She just focused on extending a fork toward Rio without looking at her, then turned her attention to shoving the rest of the food into the fridge with mechanical efficiency.</p><p>Her skin definitely wasn't buzzing like she'd been struck by lightning. Her heart definitely wasn't hammering against her ribs like the mere act of touching Rio could give her a stroke.</p><p>It was fine.</p><p>It was just proximity.</p><p>It would pass. With time. With <em>distance</em>.</p><p>Agatha crammed the last container into the fridge, slammed the door shut with a little more force than necessary, and fled the kitchen before Rio even had time to put the cold lasagna in the microwave.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The following morning, everything was fine<em>.</em></p><p>Okay, so <em>maybe</em> she got up a few minutes earlier to avoid bumping into Rio in the kitchen while she made breakfast.</p><p><em>Maybe</em> the moment she heard the guest bedroom's door open, she told Nicky she would wait in the car, and he looked up from his half-finished cereal with a confused crease between his brows.</p><p><em>Maybe</em> she sat in the driver's seat for fifteen minutes, simultaneously feeling like an idiot for hiding and the cleverest person alive for finding a way to do it.</p><p>It was all circumstantial.</p><p>Agatha was <em>fine</em>.</p><p>But she needed <em>distance</em> to keep that up, to regain her bearings and disconnect whatever synapses had woken up at the gala, making her life difficult.</p><p>Hence, hiding in her car until Nicky joined, ready for school, and still visibly confused by her abrupt exit.</p><p>Combined with spending the entire Sunday at Wanda's and then retreating to her bedroom after putting the containers away, her behavior started creating a pattern of carefully planned avoidance, but Agatha didn't care. Needing space to get herself in check wasn't a crime, and if that made her spend the evening locked in her room, equal parts terrified and hopeful that Rio would find some lousy excuse to knock on her door, well, that was just life.</p><p>It was also pathetic.</p><p>Like, <em>objectively</em> pathetic.</p><p>But the alternative was sitting at the table with Rio, who would undoubtedly ask about her day in that soft, curious voice that, for some reason, made Agatha feel important and wanted. So, Agatha remained trapped in her bedroom of her own volition, listening to every creak and shuffle as Rio obliviously lived her life while Agatha's dignity crumbled.</p><p>At least now, it was Monday.</p><p>She didn't have to invent excuses anymore - except for the convenient changing of her morning routine - and could readily sink into the familiar structure of the beginning of the work week.</p><p>Somehow, it still felt wrong.</p><p>She sat at her desk, flipping through a stack of case files with the enthusiasm of a corpse, the fluorescent light above her buzzing like an insect she couldn't swat away.</p><p>Usually, Mondays were the reset button, a way to submerge herself in deadlines, caffeine, and emails, and keep her mind sufficiently occupied.</p><p>Today, the piles of issues she needed to look into felt inadequate, a drop in a bucket of more pressing thoughts that emerged every other minute.</p><p>By ten-thirty, she realized she'd been rereading the same page for twenty minutes straight, the words blurring into meaningless ink patterns.</p><p>By noon, she caught herself staring at Billy through the door like a creepy lurker, trying to figure out what Rio had told him about the gala.</p><p>By one, her spacious office started feeling like a poorly ventilated enclosure, and she rose to her feet, slamming her laptop shut with an annoyed growl.</p><p>She needed more coffee.</p><p>When she pulled open the door, Billy jumped up from his desk like a puppet whose strings had been yanked too hard, his eyes widening at her scowl.</p><p>"Is everything alright, Mrs. Harkness?" he asked tentatively.</p><p>"I'm getting coffee. At ease, Teen," she grumbled, breezing past him only for him to lurch awkwardly into her path with the gracelessness of a baby giraffe.</p><p>Honestly, the guy was well into adulthood and still moved with the gangly nerves of a freshman at his first homecoming dance. <em>Nicky</em> was more coordinated, and he was ten.</p><p>"I can get that for you!" Billy squeaked, his voice suspiciously high and almost pleading.</p><p>Agatha frowned, gesturing to his desk. "I've given you different tasks. Fetching myself a cup of coffee from the kitchen won't kill me."</p><p>Billy's face glitched momentarily, a look of horror flashing in his eyes. "The kitchen?" he repeated, his voice cracking. "Don't you want one from the stand downstairs? I could also go to the cafe down the street. The coffee there is <em>way</em> better, and they use ethically sourced beans, which-"</p><p>"Teen," she snapped, crossing her arms. "Get back to work and stop telling me where to get coffee."</p><p>He blanched at her tone, his mouth opening and closing a few times before he nodded with a defeated sigh. "Yes, ma'am."</p><p>Agatha shot him one last withering look as he sank miserably back into his chair, then turned and disappeared into the maze of corridors she had learned to navigate with practiced ease over the years.</p><p>Her office was tucked away in the south wing, overlooking the busy street lined with mediocre cafes selling overpriced coffee and high-end restaurants perfect for meeting clients. Choosing the particular room was a no-brainer - it was well-lit, spacious, and, more importantly, secluded from the other partners. The location usually prevented anyone from bothering her unless they had <em>actual</em> business to discuss, reducing unnecessary pop-ins to a minimum.</p><p>The only downside was the inconveniently long walk necessary to reach the closest kitchen, which, on average days, annoyed her so much that she opted for sending Billy to fetch her coffee.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>Today, Agatha felt almost relieved to weave across the maze of desks, whiteboards, and file cabinets, listening to the rhythmical tapping of keyboards and hushed conversations between the employees.</p><p>Typically, it all faded into meaningless background noise, but today, there was an undercurrent - a buzz she couldn't entirely ignore. Conversations seemed more insistent, faces a little too animated.</p><p>Agatha didn't bother eavesdropping. Whatever drama had them wound up was none of her business.</p><p>When she finally reached the kitchen, which was unusually empty considering the time of day, she quickly made a beeline for the coffee machine.</p><p>With her hip propped against the counter and the high cabinets obstructing her from view, Agatha watched the dark liquid trickle into the company-issued mug, wondering if she should Google the lethal dosage of caffeine before drinking it.</p><p>She hadn't decided how beneficial dropping dead mid-Monday from a caffeine overdose would be when the kitchen door swung open with a soft creak.</p><p>Voices spilled in, casual and unhurried. A group of associates, by the sound of it, probably taking a break from their endless meetings.</p><p>Agatha stayed behind the cabinets, sipping on the coffee. It wasn't even about eavesdropping - she couldn't care less about their conversation - but emerging from her hiding spot would undoubtedly bring a chorus of greetings and the kind of brittle smiles that screamed <em>Please don't murder me</em>. And if she overheard anything, well, they were the ones talking too loudly.</p><p>"No, seriously," a woman laughed, the sound light and incredulous. "Have you <em>ever </em>seen her do that at a party?"</p><p>Another voice - a man this time - snorted. "I honestly didn't think she had the necessary programming. I mean, Harkness? Dancing? Like <em>that</em>?"</p><p>Agatha stiffened, gripping the mug tightly.</p><p>Another guy chimed in, cackling. "C'mon, if you had a wife like that, you'd want to stake your claim. Have you seen Ms. Odinsdottir-"</p><p>"Yes!" the woman interrupted excitedly. "God, I thought I was the only one who saw it! Harkness looked ready to rip her throat out when Hela started flirting."</p><p>"It was like watching a National Geographic special," the man agreed, audibly delighted. "Alpha wolf guarding her mate before performing a mating dance."</p><p>"That's for birds, you idiot," a different woman grumbled. "But honestly? Same vibe."</p><p>There was a short burst of laughter, light and cruel in that effortless office way. Agatha took a careful sip of coffee to cover the fact that her hands felt a little too warm.</p><p>"You guys have to admit," she added after a beat, "they looked good together. And I've never seen Harkness so... relaxed. Like she was actually enjoying herself instead of searching for the nearest emergency exit."</p><p>Someone hummed in agreement. "I thought the paralegals were pulling our leg when they said Harkness was married to a human being and not her job."</p><p>"Right?" the first woman sighed. "I figured she was incapable of emotions other than anger or indifference, but, shit, I want someone to look at <em>me </em>the way she looks at her wife."</p><p>Agatha casually cleared her throat, having heard enough.</p><p>It slashed through the silence like a guillotine.</p><p>She let them sweat for a moment longer, rounding the cabinets slowly, coffee in hand, fixing them with a level, unimpressed stare.</p><p>The associates - six of them, she noted absently - looked like they were bracing for impact, a mixture of terror and poorly concealed regret tightening their features.</p><p>No one dared move.</p><p>No one dared <em>breathe</em>.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head lazily and offered them a sugary smile.</p><p>"No, please," she said, her voice laced with steel. "Don't stop on my account."</p><p>Six pairs of eyes stared at her in unadulterated fear as she walked past them and out the door, her heels striking the tile like gunshots.</p><p>As it swung shut behind her, she caught the faintest whispers of desperate voices:</p><p>"<em>Since when does she leave her office?</em>"</p><p>"<em>Holy shit. We're dead</em>."</p><p>"<em>Fuck, the job market is awful right now.</em>"</p><p>Agatha barely registered them, too focused on the thoughts bouncing around her head like tennis balls.</p><p>
<em>Wife.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alpha wolf guarding her mate.</em>
</p><p>She walked through the halls, fingers loose around the mug and her back straight. The buzz of whispered conversations still carried through the office, and she noticed how it quietened the moment she stepped into another space, shifting into an almost guilty silence as she breezed through the room.</p><p>Too focused on the existential crisis caused by the gala, Agatha had almost forgotten about the primary reason behind dragging Rio to the event.</p><p>It had been about optics, about providing evidence - tangible, visible, undeniable proof - that her marriage was authentic enough to survive scrutiny. The plan had been simple: spark gossip, let it snowball, and finally worm its way through the grapevine until it reached Evanora's ears, twisted and inflated by every mouth it passed through.</p><p>And, apparently, it had worked <em>spectacularly</em>.</p><p>The office hummed with it, a low, pulsing current of rumor she could almost taste in the air.</p><p>And that didn't even account for Evanora's direct little spies lurking behind champagne flutes and polished smiles at the gala.</p><p>Agatha reached her office and slipped inside, closing the door with a firm <em>click</em>. She set the mug down with more force than necessary and sank into her chair, the leather creaking under her.</p><p>She should have felt nothing but satisfaction - the smug, burning kind she had learned to associate with the rare occasions she gained the upper hand on her mother.</p><p>Instead, the cold, uncomfortable feeling from the day before resurfaced, wrapping around her lungs even more persistently.</p><p>The one Wanda had kindly identified for her.</p><p>The plan had worked perfectly. Everybody at the office was talking about her and Rio just as intended.</p><p>And yet, Agatha still felt <em>lost</em>.</p><p>The chatter kept replaying in her head, unwelcome and persistent.</p><p><em>"God, I want someone to look at </em>me <em>the way she looks at her wife."</em></p><p>Her jaw ticked.</p><p>It was stupid. Agatha didn't care for the opinions of junior associates, who had nothing better to do than gossip. If anything, she should be glad they had added aspects to the story that would enhance its credibility.</p><p>Whatever they had seen was a part of the act - each touch, look, and word crafted for the audience.</p><p>Agatha repeated the thought like a mantra, jabbing her finger into the laptop's power button, but the raw envy in the associate's voice kept ringing in her ears.</p><p><em>"God, I want someone to look at </em>me <em>the way she looks at her wife."</em></p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, squeezing her eyes shut against the memory that surfaced - Rio laughing at something ridiculous, head tilted back, face lit up, and Agatha's chest squeezing <em>painfully </em>at the sight.</p><p>No calculation. No strategy. Just an instinctive, helpless kind of awe.</p><p>And people had seen it.</p><p>Worse, they had <em>recognized </em>it for what it was - something real, something <em>tender</em>.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered, her reflection staring back at her from the laptop's black screen - eyebrows scrunched, lips pressed into a thin, unamused line - a picture of perfect denial.</p><p>Was she in denial?</p><p>Wanda had already backed her into a corner until she admitted the low, constant hum of want she had worked hard to ignore. And Agatha was halfway to compartmentalizing it, tucking it away in a lockbox and burying it in the deepest corners of her mind where it couldn't do any damage.</p><p>Maybe the associate was just lonely. Maybe she hadn't gotten laid in a while. Maybe <em>the way she looks at her wife</em> meant something shallow. Something greedy and skin-deep, not anything more dangerous.</p><p>That Agatha could live with. She had enough self-awareness to realize she had probably spent the better part of the gala devouring Rio with her eyes. Everybody else certainly had, and at least <em>she</em> had some twisted right to do it.</p><p>Because it was a part of the performance.</p><p>The performance she and Rio had sold to a room full of people who earned money by seeing through bullshit.</p><p>That was <em>all</em> that mattered.</p><p>Not the way some shallow, reckless part of her - the part she usually kept buried six feet under- purred contently after hearing other people calling Rio <em>hers</em>.</p><p>She wasn't happy about it. She was <em>satisfied</em> because it meant the deal was paying off.</p><p>And that was the entire point of Rio being in her life in the first place.</p><p>A sharp knock rattled her doorframe. Agatha looked up, frowning.</p><p>Billy stood there, nervously wringing his hands. "Uh, I have Mr. Bradford on hold?" he pointed to the phone on her desk with a shaky hand as if she needed help locating it. "It sounded urgent."</p><p>"How urgent?" Agatha drawled, leaning back in her chair. "Don't I pay you to gather information?"</p><p>"Mr. Bradford wouldn't say," Billy rushed to explain, stepping back toward the door. "I could try-"</p><p>Agatha waved a dismissive hand at him, already reaching for the phone. "And Teen," she called after him when he grabbed the handle to flee her office. He glanced at her uncertainly. "I don't need protecting from rumors. Your relationship with Rio doesn't change anything. Stay in your lane."</p><p>Billy lowered his gaze, looking guilty. "Yes, Mrs. Harkness."</p><p>Satisfied with the quick capitulation, Agatha waited until the door closed behind him before raising the phone to her ear.</p><p>"Mr. Bradford, good afternoon," she greeted emotionlessly, powering up her laptop again to rid it of the pale face staring back at her.</p><p>"Mrs. Harkness, apologies for the unscheduled call," Bradford said, his voice tense but polished - the tone of a man familiar with urgency but unused to handling it himself. "I'm afraid an issue has come up regarding the Harper acquisition."</p><p>Agatha drummed her fingers against the desk, watching her wallpaper come to life. She almost groaned at the onslaught of new notifications. "What sort of issue?"</p><p>"They've amended the indemnity terms - rather aggressively - and are demanding execution by tomorrow morning. Our internal counsel flagged it, but frankly..." He trailed off, an unspoken admission hanging in the air.</p><p>Frankly, they didn't trust their internal team to handle it without her.</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair. "You've sent me the revised documents?"</p><p>"Yes. Just now. I wouldn't ask if it weren't critical, but I need your eyes on it today. We can't afford to move forward without your sign-off."</p><p>Of course. After all, they didn't pay the company a ridiculous amount of money to take care of their own problems.</p><p>"Understood," Agatha said coolly. "I'll review the amendments and advise you on the appropriate course of action. Expect my call within the hour."</p><p>There was a sharp exhale of relief on the other end. "Thank you. I know it's an imposition-"</p><p>"It's my job to protect your interests, Mr. Bradford," she interrupted smoothly. "We'll handle it."</p><p>"Much appreciated, Mrs. Harkness," he said, recovering some of his composure.</p><p>Agatha ended the call, lowering the receiver with deliberate care.</p><p>Her hand hovered over the coffee mug for a moment before she turned to her laptop instead, pulling up the incoming email flagged <em>URGENT</em> in the subject line.</p><p>The amended contract was already waiting for her, along with a panicked note from Bradford's in-house team that reeked of desperation.</p><p>Her eyes skimmed over the first few lines, her frown deepening.</p><p>Harper's counsel hadn't simply amended the indemnity terms. They had gutted half the representations and warranties section as well, tucking it under a deliberately vague heading.</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek, glancing at the clock in the bottom right corner of the screen.</p><p>Nicky had Spanish after school - a compromise born out of negotiation and stubbornness, as most things with her son were these days. He'd been adamant about learning the language, charmed by Rio's bilingualism, and Agatha, unwilling to let <em>that</em> particular can of worms open, had pushed for official lessons instead.</p><p>Her son had spent the afternoon sulking after Agatha had explained that Rio was too busy to teach him, but got over it quickly when the woman had almost face-planted into the wall from exhaustion that evening.</p><p>The additional hour bought by the extracurricular should have given her just enough time to tackle the mess now blinking at her furiously from the laptop screen.</p><p>But it wasn't.</p><p>The Harper amendments were a carefully planted minefield, and rushing through them was a mistake Agatha simply couldn't afford. She needed at least four hours to get through the document, make the necessary adjustments, and talk them over with Bradford's team. And her client's urgency made her doubt she could start working on it now, take a break to collect Nicky, and finish the assignment from home.</p><p>Her hand hovered over her phone, her mind already flipping through options.</p><p>Wanda? No. Her brother was in town for barely forty-eight hours before returning to Europe, and Agatha had enough humanity left not to rip her away from the little time she had with him.</p><p>Mrs. Hart? No. From what Rio had told her - because, apparently, the woman had nothing better to do than chat with their annoyingly friendly neighbor - Sharon was visiting her sister and would be back by Wednesday.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, feeling the walls closing in.</p><p>The list of people she trusted with Nicky was laughably short. Shorter still, when factoring in who could drop everything on such short notice.</p><p>There was only one name left.</p><p>One name she had authorized to pick her son up from school a few weeks ago, vowing to never use the option.</p><p>And now, that name was her <em>only</em> option.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose, reaching for her phone with the resigned precision of someone pulling a knife out of their gut. If she wanted to fix the mess Bradford's team had dumped in her lap and not leave Nicky stranded outside the school gates, she would have to ask <em>Rio </em>for help.</p><p>She didn't like how natural the thought felt.</p><p>She liked even less how it didn't feel like an imposition but a reluctant sort of relief.</p><p>Her thumb hovered over Rio's contact for a beat before she pressed call, jaw tightening as she listened to the first two beeps.</p><p>"Hey," Rio said, her voice mixing with the distant hum of music and conversations. "Everything alright?"</p><p>Agatha swallowed back the immediate urge to snap at her to stop sounding so concerned.</p><p>"Are you done with classes?" she asked instead, the question a futile attempt at pretending she didn't have Rio's schedule memorized.</p><p>Rio paused, and Agatha could imagine the frown pulling at her eyebrows. "Yeah, I'm running some errands."</p><p>"Great. I need you to pick up Nicky," she said in the professional tone she had used minutes before with Bradford. "Something came up at work."</p><p>A part of her knew she should've <em>asked</em>, not ordered. Rio had no obligations to her or Nicky. She could've easily brushed the ridiculous request off and told Agatha she wasn't Nicky's babysitter.</p><p>But, of course, Rio merely hummed like the demand was the most natural thing in the world. "Sure. Is he done with Spanish at the usual time?"</p><p>"Yes," Agatha confirmed, staring blankly at the document open on her laptop as if it might somehow finish itself.</p><p>"Got it. I'll be there."</p><p>There was no <em>Is it serious?</em></p><p>No <em>Can't you just do it?</em></p><p>No guilt-tripping or theatrics, just simple, unquestioning acceptance.</p><p>The sort that made Agatha's throat feel uncomfortably tight.</p><p>She cleared it. "Thank you," she said, brisk but sincere.</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, and Agatha hated how much it curled around the edges of her self-control. "You don't have to sound like you're sending him off to war. It's just me."</p><p>Agatha bristled automatically, out of habit more than actual offense. "I know," she said dryly.</p><p>"I'll text you when I have him," Rio promised. "Don't worry, and focus on work. <em>Te veo</em>."</p><p>The line clicked dead a second later, leaving Agatha staring at her phone.</p><p>It should have been a simple transaction, but it lingered strangely, like the ghost of a touch she hadn't realized she missed.</p><p>She set the phone down carefully, flexing her fingers once before returning them to the laptop.</p><p>Work. Focus on work. She had bigger problems than the disorienting realization of how easy it felt to trust Rio with the most important person in her life.</p><p>Or worse, rely on her in moments of weakness.</p><hr/><p>Agatha had always seen her office as a battlefield where she was the only competent soldier thrown into a lost battle in hopes of turning it around. Her professional attire was her armor, her knowledge was her weapon, and her enemy was whatever problem the clients threw at her.</p><p>And right now, the enemy was winning.</p><p>The glowing red flags in the document screamed at her from the screen, creating a contractual landmine set up by Harper's counsel and mapped out by Bradford's team.</p><p>Her eyes burned. Her coffee was cold. Her mouth tasted like defeat and bureaucracy.</p><p>And then, her phone buzzed four consecutive times.</p><p>Rio Vidal [5:14 P.M.]</p><p>
<em>our precious cargo's picked up</em>
</p><p>
<em>he explained Spanish grammar to me in detail</em>
</p><p>
<em>I barely survived, had to buy him churros</em>
</p><p>
<em>we're heading home now</em>
</p><p>Agatha stared at the screen, rereading each message like she'd stumbled into someone else's life.</p><p>Then, one more came in:</p><p>Rio Vidal [5:16 P.M.]</p><p>
<em>want me to start dinner? or should we tackle the problem of tupperware reigning over our fridge?</em>
</p><p>Her fingers wrapped tightly around the phone as she scanned the texts.</p><p>Not <em>your son.</em></p><p>Not <em>I picked up Nicky.</em></p><p>Not even <em>let me know when you're on your way.</em></p><p><em>Our </em>precious cargo.</p><p>We're heading <em>home</em>.</p><p>Agatha's fingers hovered over the keyboard, unsure what to do with the warmth spreading across her chest. It shouldn't feel that effortless. <em>She</em> shouldn't feel that comfortable reading the messages and seeing those words that indicated a level of domesticity and understanding she had never known before.</p><p>She inhaled slowly, willing her brain to figure out an appropriate response.</p><p>Me [5:20 P.M.]</p><p>
<em>The leftovers are fine. Don't let him have more sugar.</em>
</p><p>Perfectly detached and commanding.</p><p>The response came a second later.</p><p>Rio Vidal [5:20 P.M.]</p><p>
<em>Ay, ay, captain</em>
</p><p>Agatha let out a soundless exhale, halfway between a scoff and something she'd never admit was a laugh. She tossed the phone onto her desk like it might explode if she held onto it any longer.</p><p>It was just a part of the performance. She had <em>asked</em> Rio to keep their conversations light over text to maintain the illusion in case her mother got hold of them.</p><p>It didn't mean anything.</p><p>The words like <em>home </em>and <em>our</em> didn't mean anything.</p><p>Agatha focused on work, ignoring how it hurt a little more than it should.</p><hr/><p>By the time she finally left the office, her spine was stiff from sitting for too long, and her eyes stung despite the custom-made glasses designed to protect her from blue light. The streets were already cloaked in the amber haze of early evening, and traffic crawled with the kind of resigned lethargy only a weekday could produce. She didn't bother with music in the car, her brain still too cluttered from the painfully long call with Bradford's team to accept any more stimuli.</p><p>When home came into view, Agatha didn't even have the strength to stress over what awaited inside.</p><p>The house - hers, technically, though the pronoun had partially lost its weight - stood calm against the dimming sky, filling her with the underrated sense of belonging. She rolled the car into the garage and stepped out, the weight of the day slipping off her shoulders as she walked into the hall.</p><p>Her ears instinctively perked up, listening for the soft music she'd learned to associate with Rio's presence in the kitchen, but the house was eerily silent. She set her bag down on the bench by the door, heels clicking against the floor as she moved further into the house.</p><p>The silence felt out of place. Agatha had grown used to Rio's background noise, to the hum of some old sitcom rerun whenever Nicky didn't reign over the TV or a playlist that made parkour seem easy. It had taken her weeks to notice, but now its absence felt loud. Rio didn't like silence. She filled it instinctively like someone with too much on their mind who needed static to drown out the noise.</p><p>"Nicky?" Agatha called softly, not expecting an answer but needing to say something.</p><p>No response.</p><p>She glanced at the kitchen as she passed, noting the running dishwasher and a half-full glass of juice next to a few worksheets displayed along the counter's edge, each filled with Nicky's messy handwriting.</p><p>Feeling like a detective on a case, she crossed over to the back of the house, cringing whenever her heels struck the floor too hard, the sound echoing in the quiet space. The garden lights had clicked on automatically with the dusk, casting long shadows against the glass doors. Still, Agatha heard the conversation outside before she saw the two silhouettes through the windows.</p><p>"-about peppers?" Nicky's curious voice reached her through the small crack left by whoever walked out last.</p><p>"<em>Pimientos</em>," Rio answered easily. "We could do those too, but we'd have to buy seedlings. It's a bit too late in the year to sow them ourselves."</p><p>"<em>Pimientos</em>," Nicky repeated carefully, tasting each letter on his tongue. "And how do you say seedlings?"</p><p>Rio laughed, the sound low and relaxed. "<em>Plántulas</em>, but I can't imagine a scenario where you'd use that."</p><p>Agatha stayed frozen for a moment, one hand resting on the cool metal of the door handle, the other braced against the frame.</p><p>She could see them now - Nicky crouched by a raised bed that Agatha was sure wasn't there when she had left the house in the morning, and Rio beside him, seated on the ground with her back resting against the polished wood. Her face shone with a thin layer of sweat in the dimming light, her sleeves pushed up, and her hands dirty. There were gardening tools scattered around them and a few empty bags of soil nearby, like they'd been out there longer than they planned to be.</p><p>It was... domestic. Intimate in a way that didn't reach for attention.</p><p>Nicky hummed, eyeing the raised bed with the exaggerated seriousness of an engineer about to file a patent. "Why do we need this?" he asked, pointing to the wooden structure. "We could just dig holes in the ground. It'd be faster."</p><p>"It would be," Rio agreed, her voice playful. She used the back of her wrist to sweep a strand of hair from her brow. "But I thought your mom would appreciate the visual aspect. It looks more organized, and I have big plans for your garden. Planting things at random would just turn it into a jungle, which I am <em>not</em> to do."</p><p>"You mean <em>our</em> garden," Nicky corrected with a toothy grin, already standing and brushing the dirt off his jeans.</p><p>Rio smiled, warm and patient, her gaze drifting toward the darkening sky. "We'll call it yours until your mom approves. Then it can be ours."</p><p>Something about the phrasing lodges itself in Agatha's throat. Ours. Like it was a place built for three.</p><p>"C'mon," Rio pushed up to her feet with a soft groan, eyes sweeping over the controlled mess around them. "Let's get this cleaned up before it gets dark."</p><p>Nicky scrambled to gather the scattered tools, piling them in his arms with Rio's help before skipping over to the edge of the property where a small shed was situated. The small, careless intimacy of it, the quiet agreement between them, made Agatha's chest ache in a way she didn't have the vocabulary for.</p><p>She finally opened the door, the soft creak pulling Rio's attention away from the half-empty bag of soil she busied herself with.</p><p>"Hey," she said, voice low and sure. There was no surprise in her tone, just the quiet certainty of someone who had expected her to come. Maybe even someone who had waited for it. "Welcome back."</p><p>Agatha stepped onto the patio, her heels clicking softly against the stone. "You've been busy," she noticed, eyes flickering between Rio's disheveled appearance and the newly built raised bed. It was cleanly constructed, the soil creating a smooth, dark surface resembling a peaceful sea.</p><p>"A little," Rio replied, brushing her palms on her jeans. There was something unreadable in her expression, open but waiting. "The weather was too perfect to waste, and Nicky was <em>very</em> enthusiastic about helping."</p><p>Agatha nodded, her eyes skimming over Rio's rolled-up sleeves and the dirt smudges across her cheekbone like a careless brushstroke. Her forearms were lean and dusted with soil. The kind of raw, tactile beauty that Agatha had not expected to find in her garden.</p><p>Rio in a smoky eye and a flattering dress was attractive. Striking, even.</p><p>But Rio like this - in flannel and worn-out jeans, her hair half-tied, gloves sticking out of her back pocket - was hot.</p><p>Like, criminally, unfairly, and <em>frustratingly hot</em>.</p><p>"I'm glad you like it," Rio said, her voice pulling Agatha back to the surface. She looked up, startled. "The raised bed?" Rio added, a flicker of amusement warming her eyes.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, desperate to push past the heat crawling up her neck. "You didn't have to rush," she said, keeping her tone even. "It's not like I'm going to change my mind about the garden."</p><p>Rio grinned, flashing the small gap between her teeth, and Agatha almost groaned in frustration.</p><p>So much for compartmentalizing the attraction; she should look into the nearest yoga instructors.</p><p>"I got excited," Rio shrugged, bending to grab the bag of soil.</p><p>Agatha's breath caught again. The flannel shifted with the movement, uncovering a thin strip of skin on Rio's lower back, and Agatha's higher-than-average IQ plummeted to sixty.</p><p>By the time she pulled herself together, Rio was already lifting the bag and walking it toward the garden's edge. Her steps remained light, her arm barely flexing under the weight, but it was enough for Agatha's mouth to run dry.</p><p>She suspected no amount of yoga could pull her mind out of the gutter.</p><p>"You know," Rio called back over her shoulder, tone light but coaxing, "you could join us for the next one."</p><p>Agatha folded her arms, grateful for something to do with them. "Rolling around in dirt and compost? Hard pass."</p><p>"Rolling around is encouraged but not required," Rio replied, setting the bag down with a grunt and turning around to look at her with a smirk. "Besides, you could use the vitamin D. You're starting to look like printer paper."</p><p>"Some of us spend our days chained to desks, busy preventing billionaires from becoming millionaires."</p><p>"Ah, yes," Rio mused, stepping back toward the porch. "A noble cause. Don't worry, though - the paleness is working for you. It's giving powerful vampire energy."</p><p>Before Agatha could decide whether the words were a compliment or an insult, the sound of rapid footsteps cut through the silence.</p><p>"Mama!"</p><p>Nicky came barreling toward them, hands and arms streaked in dirt, eyes wide with excitement. He looked like he'd been rolling, required or not.</p><p>Before Agatha could react, his grubby fingers wrapped around her wrist and tugged. "Did you see what we did?!"</p><p>"Nicky!" she groaned, twisting her arms as delicately as possible, trying to avoid collateral damage to no avail. There was already a dark smudge staining the crisp white cuff of her button-up. "This is dry-clean only."</p><p>Nicky didn't even blink, too busy vibrating with pride as he dragged her over to the raised bed, nearly hopping in place. "Do you like it? We built it all by ourselves!"</p><p>Agatha stared at the long, tidy frame, the soil leveled neatly across its surface, the little white stakes already marking out rows for planting. It was a rectangle of dirt, yes, but it carried intent. Care, even.</p><p>"I see that," she said, adjusting her sleeve. "Very Bob the Builder of you."</p><p>"Yes, we can!" Nicky giggled, beaming. "Rio said this one's for tomatoes and basil because they're friends-"</p><p>"Companion plants," Rio supplied gently, standing on Agatha's right.</p><p>"-but when we build more, we can have cucumbers and peppers! For peppers, we'll need..." he paused, face scrunched up in concentration. "<em>Plántulas</em>!" he exclaimed, turning to Rio with a proud grin. "See? I used it!"</p><p>"Good job," Rio praised him with a warm smile before glancing at Agatha with a teasing glint in her eye. "That's seedlings. For those who don't know."</p><p>Agatha huffed, but it came out more as a chuckle. "Thank you, professor. I can't believe he's four lessons in, and you two are already ganging up on me."</p><p>"I can teach you, Mama," Nicky offered sincerely. "Plants are <em>plantas</em>, which is easy, and basil is <em>alba- al-</em>"</p><p>"<em>La albahaca</em>," Rio interjected again, shaking her head to get a loose strand of hair out of her face. She groaned when it fell into her eye instead.</p><p>Without realizing what she was doing, Agatha reached over to tuck it behind her ear, stopping dead in her tracks when her fingers brushed against Rio's sweaty temple.</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>The strand of hair stayed obediently in place behind Rio's ear, but neither of them moved for a heartbeat too long.</p><p>Nicky, blissfully unaware of the tension that had just cracked open between the adults, had already turned back to the raised bed, poking at the dirt with his fingers and mumbling something about needing a sign that said "Tomato Town."</p><p>Agatha's hand hovered awkwardly in the space between them for a second more before she pulled it back - carefully, almost reluctantly.</p><p>"Thanks," Rio muttered, her smile crooked and playful. Her eyes locked onto Agatha's like she was reading a manual only she could understand. "It was driving me nuts."</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and stepped back, the space between them feeling dangerously small. "What's the point of having gloves if you still end up with dirt under your nails?"</p><p>Rio shrugged, unfazed, wiggling her mud-caked fingers with a grin. "I <em>had </em>the gloves on. Got the cheapest ones the store had, though. Who knew quality costs money?"</p><p>Agatha's frown deepened as she glanced from Rio's hands to the newly constructed raised bed and the empty soil bags strewn around. "Wait, don't tell me you paid for all of this?"</p><p>Before Rio could answer, Nicky perked up again, apparently deciding that the sign could wait. "We went to Home Depot! And Rio got me a new pot for Luci! It has a Creeper on it!" he bounced on the balls of his feet, eyes gleaming with delight.</p><p>"They had a collab with Minecraft," Rio added with another shrug as if the logic behind it was a mystery to her.</p><p>"I'll show you!" Nicky yelled, already bolting toward the house in a blur of dirt-smudged joy.</p><p>Agatha barely registered the horror of what state he'd leave the floors - and possibly the walls - in. Her focus was entirely on Rio, who was still standing there with soil on her jeans and a quiet, unapologetic calm in her eyes.</p><p>"The errands you were running when I called," she said slowly, the pieces clicking into place. "You were buying things for the garden?"</p><p>"Browsing," Rio replied with an infuriating smirk. "I left the store to pick up Nicky and returned with him."</p><p>Agatha looked at the construction again, wondering how much money Rio had poured into it. "Why didn't you tell me? I could've-"</p><p>"I know," Rio interrupted, her voice even. "You'd insist on Venmo-ing me down to the last cent. It would've turned into a thing."</p><p>"It <em>is</em> a thing," Agatha countered without any bite, her voice more resigned than combatant. "You're spending money and time on something that isn't..." her voice faltered, the word <em>real</em> refusing to leave her throat. "That you won't get to see in a year."</p><p>The silence between them stretched.</p><p>Rio shifted beside her, the rustle of denim and flannel urging Agatha to look at her. The porch lights barely reached them, but she could still see the change in Rio's expression: the easy amusement was gone, turned into something quieter.</p><p>"Then I'll have to enjoy it while I can," she said softly, eyes moving from the raised bed to Agatha with unhurried precision.</p><p>The solemn look in them was enough for Agatha's breath to hitch. "Why put in the effort if it's temporary?" she asked quietly.</p><p>Rio smiled, warm and genuine, her voice softening even further. "It doesn't feel temporary."</p><p>The words slipped under Agatha's skin with an intimacy she hadn't been prepared for. They weren't talking about the garden anymore - about wooden structures, soil, and money - and she didn't know what to do with that. She didn't know what to make of the gravity in Rio's tone, the gentleness of her eyes.</p><p>It all felt like too much and not enough at the same time, like they'd tiptoed past too many boundaries without ever acknowledging the line. Like the things they weren't saying were pressing against them, still lingering in the cool air and the dark garden soil, waiting for permission to be spoken aloud.</p><p>She swallowed thickly, the silence wrapping tighter around them, its weight almost suffocating.</p><p>Rio's lips parted, and Agatha waited for a clever remark, a joke, anything to break the tension. But all that came out was a soft exhale that sounded almost like surrender.</p><p>It drew Agatha in - a small, barely noticeable step forward as she held Rio's gaze, searching her eyes for something, <em>anything, </em>that would help her make sense of the pull.</p><p>Then, a sharp crash erupted from inside, followed by Nicky's gleeful shout: "<em>I got it!</em>"</p><p>Agatha flinched, snapping away from the tantalizing warmth of Rio's eyes to look at the house. Through the glass, Nicky was trying to wrestle the door open with his elbow while holding the potted plant in both hands.</p><p>"I-" she cleared her throat, the word coming out quieter than intended. "I'll look at it inside!"</p><p>Nicky gave her a thumbs-up and a grin before disappearing behind the blinds.</p><p>Rio chuckled, the sound more strained than usual, and stepped back to gather the empty bags. "I think you have about a minute before he breaks through the window."</p><p>Her voice was steady, teasing, even, but something about it felt different. Like she was trying to guide them away from the edge of something too unguarded. The kind of truth that shifted the ground if you looked at it too long.</p><p>Agatha stared for a beat, watching Rio gather the empty bags into her arms with more purpose than necessary.</p><p>"I'll pay for the next one," she finally said, the words louder than she intended in the hush between them. They dropped into the space like a pin in a still room. "And for whatever else you need."</p><p>As she expected, Rio straightened her back, her eyes sharp even in the soft glow of the patio lights. Before she could argue, Agatha pressed on.</p><p>"It's the least I can do," she added, almost coaxing. "I doubt I'll be much help around here."</p><p>Rio didn't answer immediately. Her gaze searched Agatha's, something unspoken ticking behind her eyes like a clock trying to decide what hour they'd landed in.</p><p>Then, her mouth curved into a lazy, familiar grin. "So, you're the fundraiser, I'm the labor, and Nicky's the dreamer."</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the ease of it. It sounded like a unit, permanence wrapped in a joke.</p><p>"You're making it sound like we're something," she said slowly, the words out before she could decide if she wanted them to be.</p><p>"A team," Rio replied with a shrug, but her voice carried something steadier beneath the playfulness.</p><p>The words didn't feel like enough. Not with the image still fresh in her memory: Rio with her sleeves rolled up and dirt on her cheek, smiling like it meant something. Nicky kneeling in the soil like he'd found treasure. The way she had searched through the house for them <em>both</em>, not just her son.</p><p>Team was too small. Too <em>clinical</em>.</p><p>Because this didn't feel like delegation or logistics. It felt like trust, like the beginning of something that could change them if they let it.</p><p>Agatha didn't know much about family. Not in the way people talked about it when they said the word like a heartbeat. Her picture of it came from sitcoms and grocery store aisles in December - something framed and glossy and unreachable.</p><p>But standing there, watching Rio unguarded and disheveled, hearing Nicky's impatient huffs through the glass, she suspected this might be it.</p>

<p>Agatha groaned when she heard the door to her office open abruptly, barely sparing Billy a glance as she buttoned up her blazer.</p><p>"Whatever it is can wait until tomorrow," she said before he could get a word in, eyes flicking to her watch.</p><p>She was supposed to leave over two hours ago, with plenty of time to get groceries and pick up Nicky from school. Now, she had barely twenty minutes before Wanda was set to drop him off at her house after picking him up with the twins.</p><p>"Mrs. Harkness-"</p><p>Agatha grabbed her purse, ready to make a break for the door without acknowledging Billy's presence any further, when she noticed the phone pressed tightly to his ear.</p><p>"I'm off. Take the message, which I<em> pay you to do, </em>and I'll get back to them tomorrow," she muttered, keeping her voice low so the microphone wouldn't pick it up. As she moved to step past him, Billy blocked her path, his eyes flashing with something close to panic as if he couldn't believe his own actions.</p><p>A threatening growl formed at the back of Agatha's throat. "Teen, I swear to-"</p><p>"It's Rio!" he blurted out, yanking the receiver from his ear and pressing it into Agatha's hand.</p><p>Her gaze caught on the caller ID: <em>Alice.</em> Agatha frowned. "No, it's not. I don't have time for this."</p><p>She tried to shove the phone back at him, but Billy shook his head, looking close to a heart attack.</p><p>"It's <em>about </em>Rio," he insisted, voice tight. "She's hurt."</p><p>Agatha's stomach dropped.</p><p>The irritation that had been simmering beneath her skin vanished instantly, replaced with something colder, sharper - something dangerously close to panic.</p><p>She stared at Billy, her grip tightening around the phone. "What do you mean, <em>hurt?</em>"</p><p>Billy swallowed, shifting on his feet. "I- I don't know exactly. Alice called, told me Rio's hurt, and asked to get you on the-"</p><p>Agatha didn't wait for the rest. She pressed the phone to her ear, her voice coming out steadier than she felt.</p><p>"This is Agatha Harkness. What happened?"</p><p>The woman on the other end exhaled in relief. "Oh, thank God. Some guy threw a chair at Rio, and one of the legs caught her head. I wouldn't call you, but I have to get this shitshow under control, and I'm her emergency-"</p><p>Agatha's pulse roared in her ears. "Where is she?"</p><p>"They took her to Massachusetts General about five minutes ago."</p><p>"On my way."</p><p>She didn't wait for a response.</p><p>Billy barely had time to stumble backward before she stormed past him, shoving the phone in his direction. It nearly clattered to the floor.</p><p>The sharp click of her heels barely registered, drowned out by the furious pounding in her temples. She barely noticed the soft chime of the elevator, only that it wasn't fast enough. Shoving past the half-open doors, she hammered the <em>close</em> button with trembling fingers until they finally slid shut.</p><p>Her stomach twisted as the elevator crawled downward, her mind racing with every worst-case scenario.</p><p>She'd hung up too fast. Had Rio been conscious when they took her? Was she in surgery? Had she bled out on that grimy bar floor?</p><p>The drive was a blur of sluggish traffic, red lights that lingered too long, and pedestrians moving as if time wasn't <em>of the essence</em>. She remembered bits and pieces: blaring her horn when a driver hesitated at a green, her fingers locked so tightly around the steering wheel she half expected it to snap.</p><p>But the details slipped through her grasp, and before she knew it, she was bursting through the hospital doors, breath unsteady, hands shaking.</p><p>"I'm looking for Rio Vidal," she said quickly, the sentence blurring into a single string instead of a sequence of separate words.</p><p>The nurse behind the counter - an older woman with glasses too big for her face and a perpetual frown that made her look like she was there against her will - gave her a once-over before her unconcerned eyes slid back to the computer screen.</p><p>"Relationship?" she asked, her voice disinterested.</p><p>"I'm her wife."</p><p>The words left Agatha's mouth without hesitation, sharper than intended, but she didn't care.</p><p>At least they got the nurse's attention. The woman glanced up again, scanning her with new scrutiny as if trying to decide whether she was lying. Agatha's fingers drummed an unsteady rhythm against the counter, aching to do <em>something</em>.</p><p>"Vidal, Rio," the nurse muttered, typing the name into the system at an agonizingly slow pace.</p><p>Agatha's fingers tightened around the counter's edge to fend off the urge to rip the keyboard from under the woman's hands and check the information herself.</p><p>Instead, she clenched her jaw. "Yes. Where is she?"</p><p>The nurse nodded toward a set of double doors, not sparing her another glance. "Room 165. Down the hall, to the right."</p><p>Agatha was already moving before the woman had finished speaking.</p><p>The sterile floors echoed her steps, carrying them across the halls illuminated by the fluorescent lights that made everything feel too bright. The knot in her stomach twisted with every passed room, her eyes sliding across the numbers as the adrenaline from the drive morphed into something heavier - something that settled in her chest like lead.</p><p>And then, <em>finally</em>, she saw her.</p><p>Rio sat upright in the hospital bed, propped against a pillow, speaking in hushed tones with the nurse leaning over her, their expressions tight. Agatha's eyes locked onto the stark white bandage wrapped around Rio's forehead, her dark curls piled into a messy heap, some held back by the dressing, others spilling loose, framing her face.</p><p>Dazed, bruised, but <em>alive</em>.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, only then realizing she'd been holding her breath.</p><p>Rio's head turned at the sound, surprise flickering across her face as their eyes met. "Agatha?"</p><p>Something inside Agatha loosened at the sound of her name on Rio's lips, but it wasn't enough to cool the fire still coursing through her veins. Arms crossed, jaw tight, she stormed forward until she was at the foot of the bed.</p><p>"A chair?" she snapped. "You had a <em>fucking chair</em> thrown at you?"</p><p>Rio blinked. Then, to Agatha's absolute frustration, she grinned.</p><p>"Technically, I dodged it. <em>Mostly</em>."</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, fingers digging into her arms to stop herself from strangling the infuriating woman.</p><p>The nurse cleared her throat, a hint of a smile pulling at the corners of her lips. "I'll give you two a minute," she said, glancing at Rio. "Then, we'll finish our conversation."</p><p>Something flickered across Rio's face - something tight and unspoken - but Agatha barely registered it.</p><p>"It's not funny," she hissed the moment they were alone. "You could've gotten <em>killed</em>."</p><p>"By a chair?" Rio scoffed, arching a brow. "You underestimate me. I'm practically immortal,"</p><p>She chuckled, only to wince immediately, the movement sending a ripple of pain through her face.</p><p>Agatha didn't even flinch.</p><p>Rio's amusement faded, softening into something quieter. "Hey," she murmured, beckoning Agatha closer with a gentle nod. Like a moth to the flame, Agatha circled the bed to stand with her knees almost pressing into the frame. Rio reached for her wrist, squeezing gently. "I'm okay."</p><p>Her eyes were warm, oozing tenderness. It only made Agatha's chest ache more.</p><p>She wasn't the one lying in the hospital bed. If anybody deserved concern, it was Rio, not <em>her.</em></p><p>"What's the diagnosis?" she asked after a beat, sinking into the uncomfortable-looking chair the nurse had been using, her hand remaining in Rio's grasp.</p><p>Rio pushed her tongue into her cheek. "Six stitches and a very persistent headache," she smirked. "The good news is my skull is stronger than a chair, so it didn't crack."</p><p>Agatha winced at the mental image, eyeing her warily. "No concussion?"</p><p>Before Rio could answer, the door swung open, and a middle-aged man in a crisp white coat strode in, tapping his finger against the tablet in his hand.</p><p>"I hear you still haven't changed your mind about the CT scan, Mrs. Vidal," he said, eyes fixed on the screen. "I understand this isn't ideal, but with an injury like yours, I must stress - it's <em>vital</em>."</p><p>Agatha's gaze snapped to Rio, eyes narrowing.</p><p>"You refused a CT scan?" her voice was sharp, her fingers tightening around Rio's wrist before she even realized they were still holding onto each other.</p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose, her mouth pressing into a firm line. "It's not necessary," she muttered. "I feel <em>fine</em>, just a little sore. Nothing a good nap can't fix."</p><p>The doctor sighed, clearly used to difficult patients. "That's the problem. Head injuries can be deceptive. You could feel fine and develop <em>severe</em> complications later. The scan is standard procedure for a reason, especially with a concussion."</p><p>"Oh, so you <em>are </em>concussed," Agatha shot Rio a look so sharp it could've sliced through steel. "You're getting the damn scan."</p><p>Rio scoffed. "And who's going to pay for it?"</p><p>Silence settled over the room.</p><p>Ah. So that was it.</p><p>Agatha schooled her features into something unreadable, aware she was entering dangerous territory. The last thing she needed was to repeat the scene from her office after Rio had learned about the car. "If money is the issue-"</p><p>"It <em>is,</em>" Rio cut in, jaw tightening. "It's a $2000 test, and it'll only prove something we already know. That I'm <em>fine</em>."</p><p>Agatha's patience, already running dangerously thin, snapped. "You don't know that," she hissed, standing up from the chair and ripping her hand out of Rio's hold. "You got hit on the head hard enough to get a concussion, and now you're sitting here debating whether your brain - your <em>life</em> - is worth two grand."</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, eyes flashing with a rebuttal, but Agatha wasn't finished.</p><p>"You're getting the scan," she said, her tone indicating the end of the discussion. "And I don't care if it costs two thousand or twenty thousand. I'll handle it."</p><p>Rio frowned. "You can't make me."</p><p>"I will personally knock you out to make you unfit to decide," Agatha growled, crossing her arms and eyeing the woman. "You're risking dying in your sleep from a brain bleed for <em>pride</em>."</p><p>Rio looked away, her fingers flexing against the hospital blanket.</p><p>After a long pause, she muttered, "It's not pride. I already owe you for the car. I don't want to owe you more."</p><p>The words shouldn't have stung, but they did.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to breathe through it, running a hand over her face. "You don't owe me anything," she said, her voice softer. "We're not keeping score here. Otherwise, I'd owe you for every meal you cook for us. I'd have to pay you for every second you spend with Nicky when I'm not home, for the raised bed in the garden, and every little thing you've fixed around the house,"</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, but Agatha shook her head, cutting her off before she could argue.</p><p>"I don't want a tally," she continued. "I just want to know you're okay, and $2000 is a small price to pay for that."</p><p>Rio's shoulders slumped, her teeth sinking into her lower lip. It made her look smaller, almost vulnerable.</p><p>Finally, she exhaled. "Fine," she muttered, sounding defeated. "But if the scan comes back clear, I'm cooking the blandest, most repulsive meals for a week as payback."</p><p>Agatha smirked, some of the tension in her chest easing. "I'll be fine. I thrive on coffee and spite alone."</p><p>Rio huffed a small laugh, leaning further into the pillow. "Unbelievable."</p><p>The doctor, who had wisely remained silent through the exchange, cleared his throat. "I'll put in the order," he said, barely hiding the amusement in his voice as he stepped toward the door. "A nurse will come to take you down in a minute."</p><p>As soon as the door shut behind him, Rio closed her eyes, sighing. "Just so you know, you wouldn't win that easily without the headache."</p><p>"Sure," Agatha smirked, easing back into the chair, her gaze fixed on Rio's face.</p><p>She didn't realize she was still watching her until Rio peeked an eye open again, brow lifting.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Agatha shook her head, feigning indifference. "Just making sure you don't drop dead before your scan."</p><p>Rio chuckled softly. "If I do, you have my permission to say 'I told you so' at my funeral," she shifted on the bed, fingers restless against the hospital blanket as her expression grew more sober. "You don't have to stay here with me."</p><p>The words landed like a slap, and Agatha almost flinched.</p><p>Did Rio not want her there?</p><p>Alice may have called her and asked her to come, but Rio didn't know that. Had she overstepped? Was this too personal? <em>Too much?</em></p><p>It dawned on her that she had not thought about their deal once since Billy burst into her office.</p><p>Her first thought should have been about keeping appearances, about rushing to Rio's side because it was expected. Her second thought should have been the deal itself - how an injury could complicate things, how a more serious outcome might give a premature out.</p><p>But none of it had crossed her mind.</p><p>All she could think about was the overwhelming, breath-stealing terror of losing Rio.</p><p>And that was ridiculous. <em>Irrational.</em></p><p>Because Rio wasn't hers to lose.</p><p>The thought settled in Agatha's chest like a lead weight, heavier than she wanted to admit. She should've brushed it off, made a sarcastic remark, and put space between them. That was how this was supposed to work, how every good business deal operated.</p><p>But when she looked at Rio now, pale-faced with slumped shoulders and the white bandage obscuring her forehead, all she could feel was that same sharp, gut-churning panic from the moment Billy had said: "<em>She's hurt."</em></p><p>She forced a smirk, its pull on her lips almost uncomfortable. "Am I such unpleasant company?"</p><p>"It's the middle of the week," Rio noticed. "You should be with Nicky, not wasting time at a hospital."</p><p>Agatha blanched. "Shit. <em>Shit.</em>"</p><p>Her hand flew to her phone, plucking it out of her back pocket under Rio's attentive gaze. "Everything alright?"</p><p>"Wanda was supposed to drop him off at the house half an hour ago," Agatha quickly dialed her best friend's number, pressing the phone to her ear.</p><p>How could she forget? What kind of a mother forgot about her <em>child</em>?</p><p>Wanda answered after a beat, her voice riddled with worry. "How is she?"</p><p>Agatha frowned. "What?"</p><p>"Rio. How is she? Is she okay?"</p><p>"How did you-"</p><p>"Billy called me."</p><p>God, Agatha should give that kid a raise.</p><p>"She's..." Agatha hesitated, studying Rio's battered state, "...going to live. We're waiting for a CT scan."</p><p>Wanda exhaled with relief. "That's good."</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaling sharply. "Yeah. Good."</p><p>Her voice felt foreign to her own ears, clipped like she was holding something back. She hated that Wanda could probably hear it.</p><p>"Listen," she continued, shaking off the feeling. "I lost track of time. I can get-"</p><p>"I'll watch Nicky until Rio's discharged," Wanda interrupted immediately. "He's <em>fine</em>, Ags. You had other things to worry about."</p><p>That should've been reassuring. Instead, it only made Agatha's stomach twist. She shouldn't have forgotten. No matter how chaotic the evening had been, how much Rio being at the hospital had shattered her focus, forgetting Nicky wasn't an option.</p><p>"I'll be home soon," she said, softer. "Tell Nicky I love him."</p><p>Wanda hummed knowingly. "I already did. And listen, call Billy when you get a second, or have Rio contact him if she's up to it. The kid's been worried sick when he called me."</p><p>Agatha swallowed past the lump in her throat. "Okay."</p><p>"I'll see you later," Wanda ended the call, and Agatha closed her eyes, the guilt sitting uncomfortably against her ribs.</p><p>When she opened them again, Rio was watching her. Not with judgment or amusement, but something quieter, something she couldn't quite name.</p><p>"Go home," Rio murmured, her eyes warm even in the artificial light. "You shouldn't put me above Nicky."</p><p>"I'm not," Agatha said immediately. She may have forgotten about her son for a moment, but he was still the most important person in her life. "He's safe at home. You, on the other hand, could be bleeding internally as we speak."</p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh, but her expression softened further. "I'll be fine."</p><p>The words felt like a dismissal. Not unkind, not harsh, but a silent permission - to leave, go home, and forget about the entire thing.</p><p>Agatha should take it. She should get up, tell Rio to call her when she is discharged, and walk out of the room without a second thought. That was the kind of person she was. She didn't waste time on feelings, especially ones that weren't real.</p><p>Except nothing about this felt fake.</p><p>She thought back to the moment Billy had told her the news. How her stomach had plummeted so fast that she thought she might be sick. How the world narrowed down to a single need: get to Rio.</p><p>Not for the arrangement. Not for appearances. Just for <em>her</em>.</p><p>It unsettled Agatha.</p><p>This wasn't what she had signed up for. The performance was supposed to stay just that - a well-defined act lacking unnecessary complications. At best, she had expected some level of companionship. But this wasn't companionship. This wasn't casual.</p><p>This was something else entirely.</p><p>And it terrified her.</p><p>She shook her head, crossing her arms. "We'll see what the scan shows."</p><p>Rio studied her for a moment, brows crinkled, and lips pursed. Then, she sighed. "Alright. If you wanna stay, stay. But feel free to change your mind."</p><p>"I won't."</p><p>Rio only hummed, her eyes drifting closed again, and Agatha couldn't help but stare. She looked at the way the woman's curls had piled over the bandage, at the soft rise and fall of her chest. <em>This isn't yours</em>, she reminded herself. <em>She isn't yours</em>.</p><p>A traitorous part of her felt hurt by the thought.</p><hr/><p>Getting Rio into a wheelchair took a Herculean effort, complete with threats, sharp glares, and long-suffering sighs. Rio grumbled the entire time, pouting like a child as she protested. Her legs were fine. She didn't need pity. The hassle was entirely unnecessary.</p><p>By the time the nurse finally rolled her away, Agatha had to resist the very real urge to turn the mild concussion into a severe one.</p><p>With Rio gone, she busied herself with the charges, her jaw twitching as she scanned the bill.</p><p>It wasn't about the money - she couldn't care less about dropping a few grand - but it made something else glaringly obvious.</p><p>Rio's insurance was <em>awful; </em>it had barely covered the preliminary exam, let alone the ambulance ride, the stitches, or the scan she'd been so adamant about avoiding.</p><p>Agatha swiped her card with a sharp, fluid motion, making a mental note to talk to Rio about getting her on <em>better</em> insurance. Whether she liked it or not.</p><p>After the payment was finalized and the nurse returned to ignoring the world around her, Agatha sank into one of the uncomfortable waiting room chairs and took out her phone.</p><p>Rio, apparently, had gotten her nurse to contact Billy and discourage him from coming to the hospital, insisting that it was unnecessary. Billy, of course, had mentioned that Agatha was already on her way, but Rio's memory was spotty, making it difficult to piece together what had happened around the time of the attack.</p><p>So, after an excruciatingly long conversation with Billy, full of hesitant silences and worried questions, Agatha finally got her hands on Alice's number.</p><p>She dialed as she watched the corridor for any sign of Rio.</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>"Hello, Alice. This is Agatha," she paused before adding, "Harkness."</p><p>"Right, yeah. Billy said you might call. How's Rio?"</p><p>In the background, Agatha could hear the steady murmur of conversations, the clinking of glasses, and the faint hum of music.</p><p>The bar was still open.</p><p>"Being forced into a CT scanner."</p><p>Alice sighed, the sound barely audible because of the noise. "Yeah, I wanted to warn you before you hung up. Rio doesn't take hospitals well - bad memories. I'm sure she'd have refused to go there if she could."</p><p>Agatha frowned, something tightening in her chest.</p><p>"If she <em>could</em>?"</p><p>Alice hesitated. "...She was out when they took her."</p><p>A cold weight settled in Agatha's stomach.</p><p>She barely processed the next breath she took, nausea curling in the back of her throat. <em>Unconscious. Bleeding.</em></p><p>Her grip on the phone tightened. "What happened, exactly? Rio doesn't remember much."</p><p>"Give me a sec."</p><p>There was some shuffling, then the background noise dulled - still there, but distant.</p><p>Alice's voice was quieter when she spoke again. "The guy was a college kid. Barely old enough to drink, tipsy, but nothing we hadn't seen before. He didn't seem like trouble, so Rio served him. After that, he was just... <em>around</em>, letting his friends buy the next rounds. Then, when he came back to the bar for shots..." she paused, searching for the right words. "He was <em>plastered</em>. Started hitting on Rio, reaching over the counter, grabbing at her."</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, bracing for what she <em>knew </em>was coming.</p><p>"So she cut him off," Alice continued. "Told him to leave."</p><p>Silence stretched between them for a beat.</p><p>"Nobody had time to react when he grabbed the chair," Alice's voice wavered for the first time, anger leaking through her otherwise steady tone. "Honestly? It's a <em>miracle</em> Rio moved enough that only one leg caught her."</p><p>Agatha's fingers clenched around the phone.</p><p>"He tried to run after he saw Rio wasn't moving, but one of the regulars tackled him," Alice added, a sharp edge to her words. "Even gave him a nice shiner in the struggle."</p><p>Agatha decided to <em>personally</em> thank that regular. Possibly offer legal services if that drunken <em>imbecile</em> had the nerve to sue. Oh, she would tear him apart in court.</p><p>"The cops and EMTs showed up fast, but honestly?" Alice exhaled shakily. "I barely noticed. Rio looked <em>dead.</em> Half her face was covered in blood. The other half was white as a sheet."</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. Her knuckles ached from the death grip on her phone.</p><p>"I tried to stop the bleeding, but it wouldn't let up," Alice admitted. "I know head wounds bleed worse than they are, but... Jesus. It was a <em>bloodbath</em>."</p><p>Agatha forced herself to breathe evenly, to shove down the burning anger clawing at her ribs. It wouldn't help. Not now.</p><p>Rio was okay. She had to focus on <em>that</em>.</p><p>But the image Alice had painted wouldn't leave her. Rio lying there, motionless as blood pooled beneath her.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>Alice had said she <em>looked</em> dead, but for a moment - for who knew how long - everyone in that bar must have thought she <em>was</em>.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth, her free hand pressing against her temple. "Is that idiot in custody?"</p><p>"Yeah," Alice said, her voice dark. "Drunk and disorderly, assault... not sure what'll stick, but at the very least, he's spending the night in a cell."</p><p>Not enough.</p><p>Agatha wanted more than an uncomfortable night in a holding cell. She wanted him to <em>pay</em>.</p><p>"She should press charges," she said flatly.</p><p>"I know," Alice agreed. "But it's Rio."</p><p>And <em>Rio</em> didn't ask for help. She didn't take things to court or spend money she didn't have on lawyers. <em>Rio </em>handled things her own way, usually by pretending they weren't a problem at all.</p><p>"I'll talk to her," Agatha decided, earning a humorless chuckle.</p><p>"Good luck with that."</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, a door down the hall swung open. A nurse stepped out, pushing Rio - still pale, still visibly annoyed - back toward the waiting area.</p><p>"I have to go," Agatha said. "Thanks for telling me."</p><p>"Take care of her," Alice murmured as if afraid Rio would somehow hear her. "She'll pretend she doesn't need it, but she does."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>Agatha ended the call and stood, meeting Rio's gaze as the nurse wheeled her forward.</p><p>"You survived," Agatha said dryly, folding her arms. "What's the verdict?"</p><p>"The doctor will see you soon to give you the diagnosis," the nurse responded, nodding toward the examination room Rio had previously occupied. "You can wait in there if you'd like."</p><p>Rio spoke before Agatha could answer. "Great. I hate waiting rooms."</p><p>There was some heaviness behind the words - an unintentional vulnerability - but one look at Rio's exhausted face stopped Agatha from prying. It wasn't the place.</p><p>"Do you want me to wheel her in or-"</p><p>"I can walk," Rio interrupted the nurse, already trying to stand.</p><p>Agatha pressed a firm hand to her shoulder, almost sighing at the solid warmth under her palm.</p><p>Alive.</p><p>"I'll take her," she muttered without moving to actually grab the wheelchair's handles, the warmth too soothing to let it go. "Thank you."</p><p>The nurse smiled, her eyes flicking between them in silent understanding. "Call me if you need anything."</p><p>Reluctantly, Agatha removed her hand from Rio's shoulder, stepping behind the wheelchair and gently pushing it toward the room.</p><p>It made Rio pout even more. "I can <em>walk</em>," she grumbled, crossing her arms. "It's not like you'll carry me to and from your car when I'm released."</p><p>"<em>If</em> you're released," Agatha said sternly, stopping the chair beside the bed. Before she could help Rio out, the woman hoisted herself up, wincing at the sudden movement but somehow managing to sit on the bed's edge.</p><p>Agatha suppressed the urge to roll her eyes at the stubbornness, the quiet defiance visible in the tight press of Rio's lips.</p><p>"I don't care what the doctor says," Rio huffed, shuffling back to lean against the pillow. "I'm not staying here for the night."</p><p>It could easily be because of the shitty insurance - which would <em>certainly </em>not cover the cost of an overnight visit - but Agatha doubted it was the main reason behind the refusal.</p><p>
<em>Rio doesn't take hospitals well - bad memories.</em>
</p><p>Agatha wished she had asked Alice to elaborate or give her advice on how to deal with Rio in case the prolonged stay turned out to be necessary.</p><p>Without the information, she could only nod.</p><p>"Okay," she said quietly. "Unless it's absolutely essential, we won't stay," Rio frowned, opening her mouth to argue. "Which I'm sure it won't be. After all, you're perfectly fine, right?"</p><p>Rio studied her suspiciously before a victorious smirk stretched her lips. "Exactly."</p><p>Maybe Rio wasn't <em>that</em> fine if she couldn't sense the sarcasm in her voice.</p><p>"So, who were you talking to? In the hall?"</p><p>Agatha sat back in the uncomfortable chair, crossing her legs. "I called Alice to tell me about the attack."</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. "<em>Attack </em>is a bit far-fetched."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. "You were knocked <em>unconscious</em>. There was <em>blood</em> everywhere," her voice was sharp, not with anger but frustration.</p><p>Because, of course, Rio was casual even about almost <em>dying.</em></p><p>"I've had worse."</p><p>That shouldn't have bothered Agatha as much as it did.</p><p>She tapped her nails against her thigh, eyes fixed on Rio's. "Alice said you looked dead."</p><p>Rio flinched. It was minuscule, a slight tremble of muscles, but Agatha caught it.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them spoke.</p><p>Then, Rio sighed and dragged a hand down her face, staying mindful of the bandage. "It doesn't matter. I'm fine. We can leave it behind us."</p><p>Agatha let out a hollow, humorless chuckle. "<em>It doesn't matter</em>? Rio, you were bleeding out behind the bar because some moron threw <em>a chair</em> at you," she leaned forward, eyes razor-sharp as she leveled Rio with a glare. "You're pressing charges."</p><p>It wasn't a question. It wasn't even a statement.</p><p>It was a clipped, straightforward <em>order</em>.</p><p>And still, Rio had the audacity to shake her head. "No."</p><p>"Yes," Agatha's voice was firm, unyielding. "I don't care how much of a hassle it is. I don't care how much it costs. That guy is <em>not</em> walking away from this with a hangover and a slap on the wrist."</p><p>Rio's jaw tensed, her injured brain clearly working on a retort.</p><p>Agatha seized the opportunity.</p><p>"If you don't want to do it for yourself," she said slowly, deliberately. "Do it for the next woman he tries this with."</p><p>That landed. Agatha could see it in the subtle twitch of Rio's brows and the conflict flashing in her eyes.</p><p>After a long moment, Rio sighed. "Fine."</p><p>It wasn't the most enthusiastic agreement, but Agatha would take it. She'd been prepared for a <em>fight</em> - a long, exhausting debate, maybe even a PowerPoint presentation.</p><p>"Great. I have a friend in criminal law, I'll call her tomorrow."</p><p>"You don't have t-"</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry, do <em>you</em> have a lawyer friend?"</p><p>Rio hesitated.</p><p>"Exactly, Agatha smirked. "Now, since we're on a roll here-"</p><p>"You're literally bullying an injured woman into agreeing to whatever you want."</p><p>"I thought you were fine?"</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, realizing she'd walked straight into a trap.</p><p>Agatha leaned in slightly, pressing the advantage. "Anyway. I'm putting you on my insurance."</p><p>"Agatha-"</p><p>"No. No arguments," Agatha raised her hand, cutting off the protest before it could start. "Given our... <em>situation</em>, it's in <em>my </em>best interest that you stay healthy. And - more importantly - <em>alive</em>."</p><p>Rio's lips parted, but Agatha steamrolled ahead.</p><p>"Your insurance doesn't cover <em>shit</em>, and I'm not risking you refusing treatment because you're too stubborn to deal with the bill."</p><p>Rio blinked, then exhaled sharply, shifting on the hospital bed. "You can't just-"</p><p>"I can," Agatha's smirk was razor-sharp. "And I will."</p><p>"I don't need charity."</p><p>The scoff that escaped Rio's lips hit harder than Agatha expected.</p><p>Because it wasn't about the deal. About keeping Rio unharmed for leverage, for Evanora, or some neat line item in their arrangement.</p><p>Sure, she had <em>framed it </em>like that - it was simple, clean.</p><p>But the truth wasn't clean. It was tangled and insistent, wrapped tight around her ribs and refusing to be dismissed.</p><p>The truth was that she cared.</p><p>Not for the contract or appearances.</p><p>
<em>For Rio.</em>
</p><p>Rio, who was fighting that care with every breath. Who saw it as transactional - something bought, not offered. Something conditional that transcended the obligations imposed on Agatha by the contract.</p><p>And it hurt in a way Agatha didn't know how to name. But she didn't let it show.</p><p>"It's not charity," she said finally, the smirk slipping into something quieter. "It's me giving a damn whether or not you bleed out on a bar floor."</p><p>Rio didn't look away, but something shifted in her gaze, an emotion Agatha couldn't quite place lurking behind the exhaustion.</p><p>"I wouldn't be here if I didn't give a shit," Agatha continued, voice low. "I wouldn’t be arguing, I wouldn't have paid the bill, and I sure as hell wouldn't be putting you on my plan if I didn't think you were worth it."</p><p>That silenced Rio.</p><p>The tension between them shifted, no longer sharp but fragile.</p><p>"I <em>will </em>find a way to do this, even if you don't agree," Agatha said, not unkindly. "Because I'm not letting you get killed just to prove a point."</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, visibly chewing on the words.</p><p>"I'll pay you back when I get the money," she murmured. "I mean it."</p><p>Agatha sighed, recognizing that was the closest she'd get to a yes. "Fine. But that means you'll have to stay alive for a while."</p><p>It earned her a faint, reluctant smile.</p><p>Agatha returned it, softer than before, settling back into the chair as the air between them had changed.</p><p>The doctor entered the room a moment later, making Agatha wonder if he had lurked behind the door, waiting for them to stop hissing at each other like feral cats in a cage.</p><p>"Alright, Mrs. Vidal," he glanced at the tablet before pressing it to his chest, arms crossing with clinical finality. "Aside from the mild concussion, the scans look good. No bleeds or fractures."</p><p>Agatha straightened in her seat, the words not as reassuring as they should be. "And the concussion? What does that mean for her?"</p><p>"Bed rest for the next 48 hours," the doctor replied immediately, voice smooth with practiced repetition. "No screens, reading, bright lights, or loud noises. And absolutely no strenuous activity."</p><p>Agatha nodded along, committing each line to memory, the weight of responsibility settling deeper with every word.</p><p>It didn't even cross her mind that it wasn't necessarily <em>her</em> responsibility.</p><p>The doctor turned to Agatha more fully, his expression softening around the edges. "I recommend someone keep an eye on her day and night," he said, his gaze steady. "Let her rest, but if she becomes hard to wake, starts slurring, gets confused, or if the headache spikes, bring her back immediately. The scans are clear, but we don't like taking chances."</p><p>Something must have shifted in Agatha's expression - some subtle tightening of the mouth, or a flicker of fear - because his voice gentled.</p><p>"It sounds worse than it is," he reassured. "These are mostly precautions. She'll bounce back, just needs time."</p><p>Rio stirred on the bed, drawing the doctor's attention with a dry, impatient question. "When can I get back to work and classes?"</p><p>"After your stitches are out, so at least ten days if there are no complications," he pulled a small notepad and pamphlet from his coat pocket, holding out the papers. "I've written you a note and a prescription for painkillers."</p><p>Then, with the kind of dramatic irony only fate could orchestrate, he handed the colorful pamphlet to Agatha. "And here's everything you need to know about caring for her at home."</p><p>Agatha accepted it with a stiff nod, swallowing hard as she stared at the cheerful print on the front. A cartoon brain with a Band-Aid smiled up at her like this was all very manageable.</p><p>"Thank you," she murmured.</p><p>The doctor gave a small nod, already stepping back toward the door. "Good luck, you two. Take it easy."</p><p>And just like that, they were alone again - except now, the air between them was heavier. Quieter.</p><p>Of course, Rio wouldn't have that.</p><p>"No screens or reading?' she groaned, slowly swinging her legs over the bed's edge with exaggerated drama. "I'm gonna die of boredom before the concussion gets me."</p><p>Agatha pocketed the pamphlet with one hand and offered the other, her voice dry. "You can meditate. Or ponder the meaning of life."</p><p>Rio huffed and, to Agatha's surprise, accepted the offered hand. Her fingers curled tightly around Agatha's wrist, knuckles white with effort as she eased herself off the bed.</p><p>"That sounds strenuous."</p><p>"You're right," Agatha said, but the words didn't carry her usual edge. "Your brain isn't used to thinking. It might make everything worse."</p><p>The joke landed flat. Because all she could focus on was how Rio swayed once her feet hit the floor. The way her grip tightened reflexively, trying not to show how much she was leaning on Agatha.</p><p>She looked pale. Unsteady. A breath away from collapsing.</p><p>Agatha's heart lurched, hot and cold at once. <em>The doctor could be wrong. What if he missed something? What if this wasn't mild? What if she were walking Rio out of the hospital only to watch her fall apart somewhere worse?</em></p><p>"I'm a PhD student," Rio muttered, breaking through her spiral. "I think all the time."</p><p>Agatha forced a breath through her nose, grounding herself in the petty normalcy of Rio's petulance. "Congratulations," she murmured. "You just diagnosed yourself with a chronic condition."</p><p>Rio grinned - weak, but genuine - and leaned into her just a little more. "I knew something was wrong with me. Only masochists go for PhDs."</p><p>Agatha didn't laugh. She couldn't. Not with her body still coiled like a spring beside this woman who joked her way through bruises and blood loss.</p><p>Instead, she tightened her grip and said, more gently than she meant to, "Let's get you home."</p><p>Rio complied, allowing the gentle press of Agatha's hand on her lower back to guide her through the halls.</p><p>The walk to the car passed in silence. Rio was seemingly too exhausted or in too much pain to keep up the banter, and Agatha was too focused on keeping her from stumbling over her feet to make conversation.</p><p>The concern still pressed uncomfortably against her ribs whenever Rio winced or grunted, making her want to check the doctor's credentials. Visions of walking into the guest bedroom in the morning only to find Rio cold and unmoving after a brain bleed circled her head like harpies, and by the time they reached the car, Agatha was halfway to picking Rio up and marching her back into the hospital.</p><p>Knowing it wouldn't work, she settled on opening the passenger door for the woman, helping her in, and buckling her seatbelt. All while ignoring weak hands trying to push hers away and half-hearted protests.</p><p>The hospital parking lot faded behind them, swallowed by the night. It must have rained sometime after Agatha had gotten to the hospital, small puddles littering the street and pavements.</p><p>Agatha kept one hand on the wheel, the other hovering uncertainly over the console, ready to steady the woman beside her if needed.</p><p>Rio was unusually quiet in the passenger seat, head tilted back and digging into the headrest, eyes half-lidded. A sliver of moonlight caught the edge of her bandage, making her look ghostly pale.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, jaw set. "You okay?"</p><p>"Peachy," Rio murmured, but her voice sounded off.</p><p>After a quick stop at the pharmacy to collect the painkillers, Agatha resumed driving to the house, eyes darting between the road and the pale woman.</p><p>Then Rio moved in the seat, a choked sound slipping past her lips as she pressed a hand to her stomach.</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p>"I'm fine," she said too quickly, inhaling sharply through her nose. "Can you just... drive a bit slower?"</p><p>Agatha frowned, staring at the tantalizingly empty road stretching before them. Still, she eased off the gas, watching the speed on her dashboard fall well below the limit.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Rio's hand shot to the door, and her entire body tensed like a coil.</p><p>"Pull over," she choked out, already fumbling with the handle. "Agatha, now."</p><p>Agatha swerved smoothly into the side street and threw the car in park just in time for Rio to stumble out, one hand clutching her abdomen, the other bracing against the door as she emptied her stomach onto the wet pavement.</p><p>Agatha was out in a flash, her boots splashing in a shallow puddle. She didn't speak - just circled the car and rubbed a soothing hand over Rio's back as the woman shook.</p><p>"Shit," Rio whispered once she could breathe, her voice thick with humiliation. "God, I'm so sorry. I-"</p><p>"Don't," Agatha said quietly, her hand pressing circles into Rio's spine. "Don't apologize."</p><p>Rio didn't look at her. She leaned against the car door, closing her eyes and exhaling shakily.</p><p>"This sucks."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"I feel pathetic."</p><p>Agatha's hand slid up, traveling to Rio's arm and wrapping around her elbow. "You took a chair to the head and have a concussion. You're allowed to be human for five minutes."</p><p>That earned her a shaky, small laugh.</p><p>Her hand squeezed comfortingly, ready to gently nudge Rio back into the car when she noticed the goosebumps littering the tan skin. Of course, in the haste of getting the woman to the hospital, nobody thought to grab her jacket from the bar.</p><p>Without thinking, she pulled off her blazer and draped it over Rio's shoulders. The younger woman stiffened at first, but didn't shrug it off.</p><p>"You'll get cold."</p><p>"I'll live."</p><p>It sounded almost like a dismissal, and Rio turned to look at her - <em>actually</em> look at her, her eyes sharper than they had been the entire evening.</p><p>"You really don't let people take care of you much, do you?" she asked, sounding curious.</p><p>Agatha blinked. "You're one to talk."</p><p>They stood there, Rio in Agatha's blazer, Agatha's hand still wrapped around her elbow like she was anchoring them both.</p><p>Agatha wondered if Rio was thinking about the night of her birthday. About how she fought every helping gesture, every offered hand as if they offended her, feeling equal parts confused and terrified by the ease with which Rio made her compliant.</p><p>The truth was that Agatha didn't have a problem with letting other people take care of her. Deep down, she <em>craved </em>it.</p><p>She just never had anyone who wanted to bear that cross.</p><p>And Rio - stubborn, confident, Rio - hauled it over her shoulder the night of her birthday and carried it around with a teasing smirk without even realizing it.</p><p>The thought lodged itself in Agatha's throat like a secret too heavy to say aloud.</p><p>She looked at Rio - sweat-damp curls stuck to her forehead, her skin pale and clammy beneath the streetlight, wrapped in her blazer - and something uncomfortably tender twisted in her chest.</p><p>For the first time since they had met, Rio was the vulnerable one, the one who needed help that went beyond throwing money at the problem, and Agatha jumped into the role automatically, guided by instinct and worry.</p><p>And Rio, even with all the grumbling, huffing, and pouting, accepted it, making something quieter settle between them. Something real.</p><p>Something dangerously close to a partnership surpassing what the deal called for.</p><p>Rio straightened her spine, brushing the hand Agatha wasn't holding across her mouth.</p><p>Wordlessly, Agatha reached into the back seat, taking out a bottle of water she kept stashed for emergencies. "Rinse. Don't swallow."</p><p>Rio took it with a grateful nod, too wrung out to argue.</p><p>After a few moments, she leaned back against the car, head tilted toward the sky. "You're good at this," she murmured, voice hoarse.</p><p>"Vomiting roadside maintenance?" Agatha teased, though it came out softer than intended.</p><p>"No," Rio said, turning her head to look at her again. "This. I've been told I'm not the easiest when it comes to injuries or sickness. But you... You know when to push and when to back off."</p><p>Agatha's brow arched. "Not sure anyone's ever accused me of tactfulness."</p><p>Rio gave a tired chuckle, the sharpness in her gaze slowly melting into weariness. "You don't give yourself enough credit."</p><p>That struck something vulnerable and unguarded in Agatha. She wasn't sure what to do with it. So, she deflected.</p><p>"Yeah, who am I kidding? I'm amazing," she mused.</p><p>"I knew feeding your ego was a bad idea," Rio groaned, pushing away from the door.</p><p>When she swayed again, Agatha's other hand shot out to her waist, steadying her. "Come on, we're about five minutes out. You can feed my ego more somewhere warmer."</p><p>Rio didn't argue. She let Agatha guide her back into the passenger seat, the blazer still draped around her, its warmth still lingering.</p><p>As Agatha closed the door behind her and slid back into the driver's seat, she glanced sideways, watching Rio settle.</p><p>The thought hummed just beneath the surface:</p><p>
<em>Let me take care of you. Just for a little while.</em>
</p><p>Of course, she didn't say it aloud.</p><p>Still, her eyes flickered over to Rio every chance she got for the rest of the drive.</p><p>When they finally walked through the door, it was almost 8 PM. Agatha automatically reached for the light switch, but the doctor's words echoed in her mind before she could flip it.</p><p>No bright lights.</p><p>"It won't kill me," Rio grumbled, catching her hesitation. Her voice was hoarse, but the defiant edge was still intact.</p><p>Agatha didn't dignify that with a response. Instead, she steered them further into the house, guiding Rio toward the guest bedroom.</p><p>They didn't make it far before Wanda appeared, materializing at the foot of the stairs like a silent sentinel. Her eyes swept from Agatha's arms wrapped tightly around Rio's waist to the tight bandage, and then back to Agatha again.</p><p>"How are you doing?" she asked gently, though her tone gave no hint as to who the question was really for.</p><p>"Thriving," Rio said, flashing a grin that was pure bravado, all teeth and no strength behind it.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, grip tightening like she could physically hold Rio's nonsense at bay. "She has a mild concussion," she corrected dryly.</p><p>Wanda's brows creased with concern, her eyes softening. "If you want me to take Nicky tonight..."</p><p>Agatha hesitated. It was a generous offer - practical, even - but she didn't need to answer. Rio shook her head so hard she winced, one hand instinctively pressing to her temple.</p><p>"No," she rasped. "Absolutely not. You're not sending Nicky away because I've got a headache.</p><p>"It's a <em>concussion</em>," Agatha hissed, her eyes narrowing. "Stop downplaying it. You threw up on the way here."</p><p>"Because you drive like you're auditioning for a Fast &amp; Furious reboot!"</p><p>"I was going five over the limit!"</p><p>"That's not comforting! That's-"</p><p>"Okay," Wanda interjected, a knowing look on her face. "So... no to Nicky. Got it."</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, resigned. "We'll be fine. Thank you for staying with him."</p><p>"Always," Wanda smiled, nodding toward the living room where the unmistakable sounds of preteen squabbling echoed through the halls. "I told him you got held up at work. Didn't want him to worry. But... he knows something's off."</p><p>Of course, he did. He had her instincts, sharp and unflinching.</p><p>Agatha sighed. "I'll talk to him later."</p><p>"I'll get out of your hair," Wanda said, already retreating, but not before she offered one last glance - sympathy threaded with something else. Understanding. "Let me know if you need anything."</p><p>"Yeah, thanks, Wands," Agatha said.</p><p>"Thanks," Rio echoed, a beat behind, voice fainter. Her attention was already fixed on the staircase - on the climb ahead - her posture bent with exhaustion.</p><p>Before Agatha could stop her, she felt Rio shift, easing out of her grip. One unsteady hand reached for the banister.</p><p>Then, Rio's foot uncertainly shuffled up to the first step, the muscles in her neck straining as she pulled herself forward.</p><p>Agatha felt ready to murder her.</p><p>"What do you think you're doing?" she snapped, jumping forward to spot the woman.</p><p>Rio didn't flinch, but she did pause, one hand white-knuckled around the banister.</p><p>"Walking," she said as if it were obvious. "You have to talk to Nicky."</p><p>"You can barely stand."</p><p>"I can stand just fine," Rio muttered, even as her shoulder brushed the wall a little too hard.</p><p>"I am <em>not</em> driving you back to the hospital with a cracked skull," Agatha growled, easily jumping the two steps Rio had managed to conquer and returning her hand to the woman's waist. "Or letting you bleed on my hardwood."</p><p>That shut Rio up for a beat. She looked at the stairs like they'd betrayed her. Like this house, this night, this whole fucking situation had turned against her.</p><p>Agatha caught the look and softened, her voice quieter. "Let me help."</p><p>Jesus, she was close to begging just to protect the woman from herself.</p><p>For a second, Rio just stood there, pride and pain wrestling behind her eyes. Then, with a defeated sigh, she nodded.</p><p>They climbed slowly, carefully. Agatha counted each step - there were too many for her liking - and mentally calculated the time she'd need to catch Rio if she stumbled. Her arm remained tight around the woman's waist, guiding her, until <em>finally</em> they reached the landing.</p><p>A few steps later, they were in the guest bedroom, and Agatha almost stumbled, caught off guard by how much the space had changed.</p><p>She remembered what it used to look like. Stark, clean lines in shades of grey and white, cold by design. It had been intentionally impersonal, curated by a designer to discourage lingering guests. Where her room was functional and Nicky's was filled with life, this one had always been more modern office than a cozy retreat.</p><p>But Rio had undone all of that without ever asking.</p><p>Plants now ruled the room - lush greens crowding the windowsills, hanging from hooks in the corners, tucked onto shelves and bedside tables in mismatched pots. Books and papers lay stacked in organized chaos, interrupted only by random trinkets: a strangely shaped rock, a glass orb, an action figure Agatha recognized from Nicky's room.</p><p>It should've felt messy, but it didn't.</p><p>Somehow, it felt lived-in. Warm.</p><p>It felt like <em>Rio.</em></p><p>Agatha stood frozen for a moment, her gaze sweeping over the soft, intentional clutter. The room smelled faintly of eucalyptus and soil. The white walls were a mere canvas to the flurry of colors. And underneath it all, a quiet sense of order - messy to her, perhaps, but curated with care. Everything had its place.</p><p>"Welcome to my humble abode," Rio mumbled as she shuffled toward the bed. She moved like her limbs were too heavy, her stubborn pride barely keeping her upright. Agatha let her go, still caught in that odd little ache in her chest as she took in what the room had become.</p><p>It wasn't hers anymore. It was Rio's.</p><p>"Mama?" Nicky's voice floated up from downstairs, small and tentative.</p><p>Agatha blinked, snapped out of her daze. She turned toward the doorway, already moving, but not before glancing back.</p><p>Rio was already halfway curled beneath the covers, grimacing as she eased herself onto the pillows.</p><p>"I'll be fine. Go," she said, waving her off with a flutter of fingers that couldn't hide the wince in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha hesitated only for a second longer, then nodded.</p><p>"I'll talk to him," she said gently. "And I'll bring you something to eat."</p><p>That earned her a soft grunt in return. She lingered for one more beat, her hand resting on the doorframe, eyes flicking once more across the space.</p><p>Then she stepped out into the hallway, pulling the door nearly shut behind her - just enough to let the light stay soft, just enough to hear Rio in case she needed something.</p><p>Nicky waited for her on the first step, lips pursed and forehead creased. If not for the exhaustion catching up to her, Agatha would've smiled at the determination in his eyes.</p><p>"Let's talk in the kitchen, baby," she said softly before he could bombard her with questions. "Did you have fun at school?"</p><p>But Nicky wouldn't be distracted that easily. He obediently followed her into the kitchen before crossing his arms and jutting out his chin.</p><p>"Why'd you come late?" he asked as Agatha opened the fridge, biting back a smile at the two containers of food Wanda had left for them.</p><p>At least she didn't have to make a last-minute grocery trip or feed Rio cereal.</p><p>She pulled out the soup and a half-full bottle of apple juice, buying herself time as she tried to think of an answer. Not a lie, but not the truth either. Her son didn't need the full, blood-stained version.</p><p>She set the items on the counter and turned slowly, leaning against it.</p><p>"There was an... accident," she said carefully.</p><p>Nicky's eyes widened. "Was it you?"</p><p>"No," she softened her voice. "Rio."</p><p>His expression twisted, and Agatha could see worry melting away the defiance. "Is she okay?"</p><p>"She will be," Agatha bent at the waist slightly to be eye-level with him. "She got hurt, but we went to the hospital, and she's going to rest for a few days. She just needs quiet, sleep, and maybe a little soup."</p><p>Nicky glanced over his shoulder, toward the stairs, then back at Agatha. "Did someone hurt her?"</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>There it was - that sharp, shrewd awareness that he always carried, barely hidden behind his baby cheeks and innocent eyes.</p><p>God, she dreaded his teenage years.</p><p>"Yes," she said after a pause. "But she's safe now."</p><p>Nicky nodded slowly, but his frown didn't fade. "Are you mad?"</p><p>"What?" Agatha blinked, straightening her spine. "Why would I be mad?"</p><p>"I dunno," he shrugged, a gesture that seemed too mature for someone with cartoon socks.</p><p>Then again, <em>Rio</em> wore cartoon socks.</p><p>"You always get mad when someone trips me on the field," he added, glancing up at her. "Even if I'm okay."</p><p>Agatha stared at him, stunned for a second.</p><p>Because he wasn't wrong. She <em>did</em> get mad - furious, actually - whenever she saw some brat trip her son on the soccer field. She'd jumped out of her seat more than once, ready to curse out a kid half her size, only for Wanda to yank her back down with a glare that promised judgment and possibly jail time.</p><p>But she hadn't expected <em>this</em>. Hadn't expected Nicky to put Rio in the same mental category as himself - someone Agatha cared for. Someone Agatha was supposed to protect.</p><p>"Yeah," she admitted, her voice coming out steadier than she felt. "I'm a little mad right now."</p><p>"Are you gonna do something?"</p><p>He didn't sound curious. He sounded <em>certain,</em> like he already knew the answer.</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through his curls. "I am."</p><p>Nicky studied her momentarily before nodding. "Okay."</p><p>She pulled him into a hug, tight and warm, momentarily silencing the storm clawing at the edges of her mind.</p><p>After a second, muffled against her side, he asked, "Do you think Rio'd want my switch? I can leave it for her when I go to school. If she's bored."</p><p>Agatha smiled, leaning back to kiss his forehead before turning toward the stove. "I'm sure she'd love it, but she can't look at screens for two days," she said gently, already reaching for a pot.</p><p>Nicky walked over, holding the soup container with both his hands, frowning. "Why?"</p><p>"You know how sometimes if you spend too much time watching TV or playing games your head hurts?" he nodded slowly. "Well, that's because your brain is tired and needs a break. Right now, Rio's head hurts <em>a lot. </em>Screens will just make it worse."</p><p>Nicky nodded again, brow furrowed in concentration as he watched her pour the soup.</p><p>"What about books?" he asked after a moment. "I can give her <em>Percy Jackson</em>!"</p><p>The eagerness in his voice nearly broke her. He <em>wanted</em> to help. He didn't just care, he wanted to <em>do</em> something about it.</p><p>"I'm sorry, baby," she said, turning toward the cupboard for a glass. "She can't read right now either. But it's only for two days," she added quickly, seeing his face fall. "After that, you can ask her if she wants to borrow something, okay?"</p><p>Nicky hesitated, lips pressed together in thought, before finally sighing. "Okay. Can I bring her the soup?"</p><p>"You can pour her some juice," Agatha handed him the glass like a peace treaty. "It's almost time for bed. You have school tomorrow."</p><p>Nicky huffed, opening the juice bottle with a scowl. "But I wanna see Rio!"</p><p>Agatha's eyebrows twitched. She knew where this was going.</p><p>"It's late," she said firmly. "She needs rest, and so do you."</p><p>"But-"</p><p>"You can see her tomorrow after school," Agatha cut in gently but with finality. "I know you're worried. I am, too. But I need your help, okay? We're taking care of Rio <em>together</em>. I can't do that if you're too tired to listen tomorrow."</p><p>That gave him a pause. His small fingers flexed around the cap. He looked down at it, jaw working slightly as he thought. Finally, he exhaled, shoulders drooping. "Okay. I can wait 'til tomorrow."</p><p>Agatha reached out and squeezed his arm. "Thank you," she said warmly. "I'll tell her you wanted to visit tonight."</p><p>She turned back to the pot as Nicky carefully poured the juice, filled the glass nearly to the brim, and - predictably - left the almost empty, uncapped bottle on the counter.</p><p>Before she could remind him to put the juice away, he darted forward, arms wrapping briefly around her waist. "Goodnight. Tell Rio goodnight,t too."</p><p>Agatha smiled, smoothing her hand up his back and pressing a soft kiss to his temple. "I will. Goodnight, baby."</p><p>Once he disappeared around the corner, Agatha sighed, reaching for the ladle and mechanically stirring the soup.</p><p>Her hands worked while her mind spiraled.</p><p>The ladle clinked against the pot, too loud in the quiet house, and she winced.</p><p>No bright lights. No screens. No loud noises.</p><p>The doctor's list of instructions played on a loop in her head, too clinical to comfort her and too vague to settle the anxiety coiling in her gut.</p><p>Rest. Hydrate. Monitor for worsening symptoms.</p><p>What if something <em>did</em> worsen?</p><p>What if she missed it? What if Rio fell asleep and didn't wake up? What if the staggering on the way home hadn't come from exhaustion but something else? Something <em>worse</em>?</p><p>She adjusted the flame under the pot as if the motion could settle her spiraling mind. Focusing on now wasn't working. She knew Rio was upstairs - safe, breathing, and refusing help like a particularly hard-headed stray cat. It was good, <em>normal</em>.</p><p>But normal was fragile if the past hours were anything to go by.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter, fingers curling around the edge, grounding herself. This wasn't supposed to be a part of the deal. Not the call, not the hospital, and certainly not the fear.</p><p>She stirred the soup slowly, watching it swirl.</p><p>Even she had enough self-awareness to know her reactions couldn’t be written off as attraction. The dull throb pulsing behind her ribs, deeper than worry and heavier than obligation, didn’t stem from something as easy as finding Rio pleasant to look at.</p><p>She pressed the back of her hand to her forehead, sighing quietly.</p><p>
<em>Fucking get it together.</em>
</p><p>The timer on the stove ticked past the third minute. She grabbed a bowl from the cupboard, methodically filled it with the soup, and set it on a tray with a spoon, the medication, and the glass Nicky had poured.</p><p>Then she paused, her fingers hovering over the edge of the tray.</p><p>
<em>You don't have to stay here with me.</em>
</p><p>The memory echoed, making her clench her jaw.</p><p>She could already predict the argument that would follow her next move.</p><p>Good thing she didn't really fucking care for Rio's broken brain's thoughts.</p><p>She picked up the tray and turned toward the stairs.</p><p>With her hands occupied, Agatha used her elbow to push the door open, letting more dim light into the otherwise dark bedroom.</p><p>Well, dark except for the artificial gleam coming off the phone currently in Rio's hand.</p><p>Agatha almost dropped the tray as she watched Rio squint at the screen, her face even paler with the light reflecting off the bandage and her cheeks.</p><p>"Are you fucking kidding me?"</p><p>The question cracked through the air like a whip, cutting the soothing silence short as Agatha pressed her foot into the door to shut it with a soft click. With the light from the hall gone, Rio's phone was the only thing illuminating the space, making Agatha even more furious.</p><p>"Turn on the lamp and put down the fucking phone," she growled, marching over to the bed in slow, deliberate steps. When Rio just stared at her, eyes wide and mouth slightly open, Agatha put the tray down on the unused bedside table and ripped the device from Rio's hand. "<em>Now,</em> Rio."</p><p>To her credit, Rio listened immediately, fumbling for the light switch just as Agatha locked the phone and slipped it into her back pocket.</p><p>The room was filled with warm, gentle light, but it did little to soothe the anger clawing its way up Agatha's throat.</p><p>"Did the concussion impair your ability to process information?" she hissed, crossing her arms. "Did you not <em>hear</em> the doctor say 'no screens'? Should I read you the pamphlet he gave me? Or maybe you want me to go on WebMD and make you listen to all the horrible things that can happen if you don't follow his fucking orders?"</p><p>Rio sank back against the pillows like a scolded teenager, her lips parting as if to speak, but nothing came out. Maybe it was guilt. Maybe it was shock. Either way, she looked caught, but Agatha wasn't done.</p><p>"You <em>threw</em> up on the way here," she continued, voice low but heated, the kind of anger that wasn't loud but <em>burned</em>. "You couldn't even stand straight five minutes ago, and you think this-" she held up a hand and mimicked swiping on a screen. "-is a good idea?"</p><p>Rio finally found her voice, and it came out quieter than Agatha expected. "I just... I had to respond to a message."</p><p>"Fucking hell, Rio," Agatha ran a hand across her face. "You're not a CEO. No one's dying because you don't text back."</p><p>"It was Billy," Rio muttered, sounding almost defensive. "He wanted an update."</p><p>Agatha spun around, eyes blazing. "So <em>call</em>. I know your generation is allergic to phone calls, but I feel like a bruised brain is a good justification!"</p><p>Rio winced, more from the tone than the volume. "I didn't mean to-"</p><p>"I know you didn't," Agatha snapped, cutting her off. "But I swear if I catch you staring at another screen, I'm duct-taping mittens to your hands."</p><p>The threat hung in the air, ridiculous and yet somehow not entirely unbelievable coming from her.</p><p>There was a pause, the anger finally beginning to ebb from Agatha's limbs, leaving her chest tight and her head pounding in its place.</p><p>She looked over at Rio again - still pale, exhausted, and looking like a kicked puppy despite having clearly broken the rules - and her fury deflated further.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Rio mumbled, putting out the anger's dying flames entirely. "I didn't mean to upset you."</p><p>Agatha sighed, voice softening. "I'm not upset," Rio raised her brow as if not believing her words. "I'm scared."</p><p>Fuck, did she say that?</p><p>She didn't mean to say that.</p><p>Something in Rio's eyes shifted, her expression crumpling at the edges. "I didn't mean to scare you either."</p><p>"Well, you did," Agatha said, realizing there was no point trying to take her words back now. "You can make it up to me by eating this soup and refraining from doing anything stupid for the next two days. Can you handle that?"</p><p>Rio nodded, subdued. "Yes, ma'am."</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes but didn't comment, placing the tray gently on her lap with a precision that spoke of how much effort it took to stay calm.</p><p>She lingered for a moment, eyeing the bandage before her eyes slid down to the neckline of her shirt, still spotted with dried blood.</p><p>"You should change before we head to bed," she noticed absentmindedly, almost making Rio drop the spoon back into the soup.</p><p>"I'm sorry, <em>we</em>?"</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the startled look on the woman's face. "Well, <em>you're </em>heading to bed. <em>I</em> will drag the chair from my office in here to keep an eye on you."</p><p>Rio gaped at her, clearly thrown. "You want to sleep <em>in a chair</em>?"</p><p>"It reclines," Agatha said flatly as if that somehow made it a luxury. "And it's temporary. Don't make it a big deal."</p><p>Rio watched her for a beat, something tugging at the corners of her mouth. "You know, most people would just set an alarm every couple of hours or leave it to chance."</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. "Yeah, well, I'm not most people. And you're a hazard to yourself."</p><p>"I'm not a toddler," Rio muttered, but there was no real heat in it. Just a quiet sort of surprise.</p><p>"No, you're right, toddlers <em>listen</em>."</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh, spoon halfway to her mouth. "Fair enough."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly. "Eat your soup, take your meds, and then change. I'll bring in the chair."</p><p>To her surprise, Rio shook her head. "No."</p><p>"For fuck's-"</p><p>Rio's voice was quiet but steady, eyes not leaving Agatha's. "We can share the bed."</p><p>Agatha blinked. "Excuse me?"</p><p>"You're exhausted," Rio said as if it were obvious. "And the chair's gonna wreck your spine. It's stupid."</p><p>Agatha's jaw flexed, her instinctive response ready to fire, but never making it past her throat. Because Rio wasn't smirking, she wasn't teasing or pulling her leg. She looked earnest.</p><p>The idea was reckless. Too close. Too personal. But the bed <em>was</em> big. And Rio <em>was</em> injured. And maybe, just maybe, Agatha was more tired than she wanted to admit.</p><p>"...Fine," she finally grumbled, pointing at Rio warningly. "We're staying on our sides, and if you start talking in your sleep, I'm turning your concussion from mild to severe."</p><p>"I only talk in my sleep after alcohol."</p><p>"Yeah, I know, and you’ll be high on painkillers. Same thing."</p><p>Agatha froze, realizing what she had said a second too late, but Rio was already grinning like the cat that got the cream.</p><p>"I told you that at the bar. You remembered?"</p><p>"Shut up and eat your soup."</p>

<p>Rio finished the soup with minimal protest, each attempt silenced by a single pointed look from Agatha. She took the meds without complaint, chasing them down with a small sip of juice, and sighed contentedly, leaning further into the pillows, which Agatha took as her cue to leave.</p><p>She quietly took the tray back to the kitchen, leaving the woman to change into something more comfortable and brush her teeth. She hesitated for a moment, an offer to help Rio change forming on her tongue, but it died just as quickly. It was too personal, too intimate.</p><p>Instead, she ducked into Nicky's room to make sure he was in bed. A soft smile tugged at her lips when she found him already fast asleep, face half-buried in his pillow, one arm hanging off the mattress.</p><p>Then, she moved on to the master bathroom and started the shower, eager to wash off the lingering scent of antiseptic and hospital air. The hot water felt like a reset, scrubbing away the weight of the last few hours and filling her ears with the steady rhythm of the stream hitting the tiled floor. By the time she was brushing her teeth, the fog on the mirror had started to clear, and so did her thoughts.</p><p>That was when her phone started buzzing on the counter, vibrating in small, insistent bursts, inching closer to the edge.</p><p>She sighed and reached for it, arching a brow at the number of new notifications. Most were from work, whiny clients, incompetent coworkers, none of which she had the energy or patience to deal with tonight. She scrolled past them, ready to put the phone down again, when one name made her pause.</p><p>Lilia.</p><p>Sent nearly two hours ago.</p><p>
<em>You're working remotely until Rio gets better. And only urgent cases.</em>
</p><p>Which, yeah, that was her plan. But something about Lilia spelling it out made it seem official. Like it was normal, expected even.</p><p>Agatha didn't reply, just moved on.</p><p>The next few were from Wanda, sent not long after she had left with the twins.</p><p>
<em>I'm driving Nicky to school tomorrow</em>
</p><p>
<em>Not a question btw</em>
</p><p>
<em>You need to take care of wifey</em>
</p><p>Too tired to argue - or text-yell - she settled on reacting to the first message with a thumbs-up and sending an eye-rolling emoji to the third.</p><p>The last ones were from Billy, and she realized he was the one who almost made her phone commit suicide by buzzing off the counter.</p><p>
<em>I'm sorry to bother you, but Rio's not responding to my texts, she okay?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Once again, sorry for texting so late</em>
</p><p>
<em>Or texting at all</em>
</p><p>
<em>I just want to know if she's okay, can you let me know?</em>
</p><p>
<em>I really don't wanna get fired for this</em>
</p><p>
<em>But like, if you fire or block me, can you give me an update on Rio first?</em>
</p><p>She stopped reading after that, already seeing the spiral gain momentum. With a tired sigh, she typed out a reply:</p><p>
<em>No one's getting fired. Rio's not allowed screens for two days and doesn't have her phone. She's alive, now stop bothering me.</em>
</p><p>She barely hit send before Billy reacted with a heart emoji.</p><p>Unprofessional, but she'd let it slide this once.</p><p>After assuring Alice, who, too, texted <em>and</em> called, that Rio was okay, she locked her phone and tossed it back on the counter with a sigh.</p><p>Her reflection stared back at her, the lack of makeup making the dark circles under her eyes and the paleness of her skin even more prominent. She <em>did</em> look like printer paper, but slaving away in her own garden wouldn't change that. No amount of sun could erase the ghostly whiteness of her cheeks because, as she looked at herself in the mirror, wide-eyed and lost, Agatha knew vitamin D deficiency wasn't the issue.</p><p>The issue was the worry pressing uncomfortably against her ribs. The slow unraveling of her firm belief that the confusing feelings holding her by the throat whenever she was near Rio were superficial.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, turning away from the mirror. She'd had a long, stressful day. Anybody would look like a shitty caricature of a person after that, and as much as she liked to disagree, she was only human. All she needed was a good night's rest.</p><p>Ideally, it would be in her own bed, but the universe still fucking hated her.</p><p>As she walked back to the guest bedroom, her steps slow and wary as if dragging out the moment would change anything, Agatha glanced down the hall, toward her office. Rio had been right: the chair <em>would</em> fuck up her back, even when reclined, but somehow, spending the next three days with stabbing pain gripping her spine seemed better than the alternative.</p><p>The alternative meaning sleeping beside Rio, in Rio's bed, close enough to touch.</p><p>Not that Agatha <em>would</em> or <em>wanted to</em>. Her attraction hadn't fizzled out, making her realize it probably never would unless Rio stopped being annoyingly good-looking and caring, which seemed unlikely. Still, she had caught all the butterflies in her stomach in a net and locked them away, using logic as a foolproof key. Rio was off limits, and that knowledge was enough to act professional about a situation that was anything but. Agatha had kept her distance, dutifully averted her gaze whenever the butterflies threatened to reappear, and stayed, at all times, at least two feet away from Rio.</p><p>And it all went to hell because Rio decided to have a fucking chair thrown at her.</p><p>Somehow, Agatha's life had turned from a Greek tragedy to a soap opera - the shitty kind with painful acting and choppy editing.</p><p>She exhaled slowly before tentatively knocking on the guest room door, silently praying that the pain meds had already knocked Rio out, sparing them the awkwardness of adjusting to the situation.</p><p>The soft permission to enter shattered the hope before it could bloom.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>Agatha tensed her shoulders as if preparing for Rio to leap out at her when she opened the door and slid into the room, swallowing the unidentifiable feeling rising in her chest at the sight.</p><p>Rio lay where Agatha had left her, half-sunken into the pillows, her body swallowed by the comforter. The harsh traces of sweat and smeared makeup were gone, wiped away and replaced by something cleaner but no less raw. Her shirt was soft-looking and oversized, the collar loose around her collarbones, and her hair had been pulled into a high ponytail, making the bandage on her temple look like a bandana. Her eyes, though, were the same - dark and ringed with exhaustion, barely open, tracking Agatha with the effort of someone clinging to consciousness by sheer willpower.</p><p>Under the amber wash of the bedside lamp, Rio looked fragile and unguarded in a way Agatha hadn't seen her before, like one more terrible day might undo her entirely.</p><p>Agatha froze, hand resting on the edge of the comforter. Her holdups aside, climbing into bed could be harmful for <em>Rio</em>. What if she moved wrong? She hadn't shared a bed with someone other than Nicky, who was half Rio's size, for a long time, and she often woke up in the middle of the bed, starfish style. They were one flung elbow away from a second ER visit.</p><p>"I can <em>feel</em> you overthinking it," Rio muttered, her voice hoarse but amused, a faint smirk pulling at the corner of her mouth. "Just get in bed."</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry for worrying about your health," Agatha snapped, fingers curling around the edge of the blanket but still not pulling it back.</p><p>Rio cracked one eye open, the smirk melting away. "You won't kill me by shifting the mattress," she noticed, tilting her head to look at her properly, something shifting in her eyes. "I'm not letting you sleep in a chair, but you don't have to stay if you're uncomfortable. I promise to let you know if something feels off."</p><p>Agatha scoffed, dropping the covers and crossing her arms. "Yeah? You're planning to text me from the afterlife with the phone you're not allowed to use? Or will you call out during a brain bleed?"</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, her mind too sluggish to form a clever comeback. "I'll figure something out," she eventually muttered, her eyelids fluttering as if she were trying to fight off sleep. "Also, I'm gonna need to call Billy. He'll worry."</p><p>"He texted me," Agatha said briskly, pulling the covers with a huff of finality. "I let him and Alice know you're relatively fine and banned from using screens."</p><p>The mattress dipped under her weight as she slid in beside Rio, stiff as a board, her movements careful but unmistakably reluctant. She angled her body toward the edge, leaving a canyon of space between them. Her right leg dangled off the bed as if she were leaving an opening to bolt if necessary.</p><p>The silence stretched as Agatha closed her eyes and tried not to focus on how the pillow smelled faintly of Rio's perfume, earthy but light. The blankets were soft and dark green, a shade she now automatically associated with Rio. And beneath all of it was that unbearable sense of ease. Safety, even.</p><p>It was too much. The perfume was suffocating, the softness threatened to swallow Agatha, and the warmth was enough to melt her if she let it.</p><p>From beside her, Rio exhaled as if the added presence in her bed was comforting. Then, softly, "Thank you."</p><p>Agatha hummed, hoping her hammering heart wasn't audible in the quiet room. "He almost made my phone throw itself off the counter. I had to intervene."</p><p>"Not just for texting Billy," Rio clarified quietly. "For everything. I know this isn't what you signed up for."</p><p>It wasn't, but not for the reasons Rio probably thought.</p><p>Marrying a stranger was supposed to ensure objectivity and professionalism. It should've created a detached, transactional relationship secured by a detailed contract like a birthday present tied with a neat bow.</p><p>In her previous understanding of the deal, the hospital visit should've been inconvenient, not a nerve-wracking experience. Seeing her wife bruised and vulnerable shouldn't have stirred anything under the surface because she was supposed to be a pawn in the chess match against Evanora. An exchangeable, unimportant pawn that Agatha didn't care about.</p><p>Instead, she almost had an aneurysm because some drunk idiot had tried to knock the pawn off the board.</p><p>So, Rio was right. Agatha hadn't signed up for the worry, the responsibility, or the unidentifiable emotions slithering between her ribs. She was out of her depth, lost in a situation she didn't know how to handle without jeopardizing the deal.</p><p>Agatha kept her eyes glued to the ceiling, mapping out the pristine white paint. Her voice was barely audible when she spoke again, but it still cut through the silence like a sharp knife. "There's a lot I didn't sign up for."</p><p>A beat passed. Then two, and Agatha tilted her head slightly, expecting Rio to be fast asleep beside her, finally defeated by the pain meds.</p><p>Instead, she fell straight into Rio's half-lidded eyes.</p><p>There was no smugness there, no teasing glint or clever remarks waiting to be delivered. Just Rio, stripped bare by the pain and exhaustion, watching her like she could see the invisible wires frying in Agatha's chest in real time.</p><p>"Same," Rio said after a long pause, barely above a whisper. "But I'm glad it's with you."</p><p>The words landed with unbearable weight, simple, honest, and entirely too much.</p><p>Agatha looked away again, her gaze returning to the ceiling. It didn't offer any relief. It was just another sterile space, reminding her of how the deal should've been - clinical and detached. And here Rio was, bleeding through every carefully placed boundary without trying.</p><p>She wanted to say <em>Don't do that, don't make this any harder.</em> But the truth clung to the back of her throat like something bitter and familiar, overpowering any feeble attempts at pretending. It was already hard. The magnetic field around Rio had already pulled her in, and Agatha felt like crying.</p><p>Because Rio probably didn't mean to do it; she didn't mean to crack something open in Agatha's chest by simply being there.</p><p>And yet, she had.</p><p>"Go to sleep, Rio," Agatha eventually muttered, her voice thick and carrying the weight of all the unsaid words. "It's late."</p><p>The silence stretched before the sheets rustled slightly, and the lamp turned off, enveloping the room in darkness.</p><p>"Goodnight," Rio whispered into the quiet.</p><p>"Goodnight," Agatha whispered back, fingers clenching around the comforter's edge as if it could shield her from the truth.</p><p>The night settled over them like a weighted blanket, warm and heavy. Outside, the thick walls and closed windows muffled the occasional hum of passing cars, and the soft tick of the hallway clock kept time with the tightening in Agatha's chest.</p><p>Rio drifted off seconds after switching off the lamp, finally succumbing to the painkillers. Agatha remained wide awake, stiff as a board with one arm folded across her stomach and the other half-curled beneath her head as she stared at the ceiling. Rio's shallow, steady breaths filled the silence like some fragile metronome she couldn't stop listening to. They mixed with mumbled comments as fragments of conversations happening in Rio’s head surfaced to the land of the living, cutting through the stifling silence. Most of them was intelligible, catching on Rio’s teeth or unable to make it past her tongue in a comprehensive manner. Still, Agatha’s heart quickened whenever a soft whisper reached her ears, the idea of keeping her promise and worsening Rio’s concussion never crossing her mind.</p><p>Agatha stared at the ceiling, Rio’s soft grunts and words a soundtrack to her unraveling. Her thoughts turned like slow gears, metal grinding against metal and jolting her awake every time she closed her eyes.</p><p>The pull toward Rio, which she'd stubbornly labeled as <em>just attraction,</em> had been manageable when it stayed in its lockbox. It was easy to explain away a glance, a smile, or the occasional skip in her pulse. Chemistry was harmless.</p><p>But this wasn't that.</p><p>Attraction didn't sit heavy in her ribcage like this. It didn't wrap around her throat or root her in place when Rio winced in her sleep. It didn't make her imagine what it would be like to care for someone, not out of obligation, but <em>want</em>.</p><p>She turned her head slightly, gaze falling to Rio's hand, half-curled on the blanket between them. Too close but not close enough.</p><p>This marriage was supposed to solve problems, not create them - a contract to push Evanora off her high horse. A deal forged in logic, delivered in legalese. Rio was supposed to be a placeholder, not a heartbeat that kept throwing hers off rhythm. But somewhere between signing the paperwork and watching Rio in a hospital bed, she'd stopped being a means to an end and started becoming, well, <em>something</em>. Something Agatha didn't know how to want without unraveling.</p><p>It was fucking terrifying.</p><p>She let her eyes drift shut for a moment, just to pretend. Pretend she could sleep. Pretend the steady sound of Rio's breath didn't matter. Pretend the hollow ache in her chest was exhaustion and not the shape of feelings for which she had no name.</p><p>She couldn't. Not really.</p><p>Then, Rio sighed again, a relaxed, content kind of breath that warmed Agatha in ways she couldn’t describe. A word tumbled out of her mouth, soft and accentuated, each syllable pronounced with reverence.</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>Her eyes snapped to the sleeping woman, half-expecting to meet a pair of bleary eyes looking at her from the other side of the bed. But Rio was fast asleep, her lips stretched in a gentle smile like she was dreaming of something pleasant.</p><p>Agatha froze, glancing toward the door. She could leave. Set an alarm and return to the room every two hours to check on the woman. She could free herself of the overwhelming heat climbing up her spine and the longing curling in her chest.</p><p>"Please."</p><p>What was Rio asking her for? What was she dreaming about?</p><p>"Stay."</p><p>Even in her dream state, the pleading in Rio’s voice was unmistakable.</p><p>Agatha blinked owlishly, watching the gentle smile disappear from Rio’s lips, replaced by a subtle frown. Her eyelids fluttered, eyes moving rapidly as if she were searching for something. <em>Someone</em>.</p><p>Before Agatha could think better of it, she reached for Rio’s hand, stretched on the duvet between them, and caressed the back of her palm.</p><p>"I’m here," she rasped, her voice not sounding like her own. Rio sighed contentedly like her body could recognize the touch even in her sleep, and stilled again, lips parting on soft breaths.</p><p>She didn’t say anything else.</p><p>After a few beats, Agatha withdrew her hand, turning to lie on her back and ignore the hammering of her heart.</p><p>She lay awake well into the small hours, haunted by every quiet inhale, every brush of warmth beside her. All the while, her mind kept returning to a truth she couldn't run away from any longer.</p><p>This was never just an attraction.</p><hr/><p>Eventually, Agatha's exhausted body claimed its due, dragging her mind into uneasy sleep despite its desperate grip on consciousness. But rest offered no mercy, only a visual interpretation of Alice's story, enhanced and casting Agatha as the show's main star.</p><p>In her dream, the bar floor was slick with blood, the air thick with the metallic sting of panic. Rio lay crumpled and unnaturally still, her breath gurgling, a red halo spreading around her at an alarming rate. Agatha's hands were trembling as she pressed down on the wound, her knees slipping on the wet ground, her throat aching from screaming for help that never came. The pressure wasn't enough, nothing was, and Rio's eyes, those impossibly expressive, clever eyes, stared back at her, unfocused and full of accusation.</p><p>
<em>You should've done something. You should've protected me.</em>
</p><p>Her chest clenched, her heart hammering a tattoo against her ribs. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't <em>save her</em>.</p><p>And then, a final breath. Unbearable stillness as Rio's face, pale and lifeless, froze mid-blink.</p><p>The shrill buzz of her phone cut through the nightmare like a blade, dragging Agatha back with brutal force. Her eyes snapped open, her left hand shooting out to silence the noise before her mind caught up with reality.</p><p>The room was dim and quiet, unlike the neon-lit, noisy bar. Her skin was wet, not with Rio's blood but sweat. Her fingers weren't pressing against Rio's wound, but curled into her shirt.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>That wasn't right.</p><p>Agatha froze, the nightmare dissolving like cotton candy in water, erased by more pressing matters.</p><p>Her gaze dropped, disbelieving, to the pale hand that peeked out from under the comforter. Long fingers gripped the neckline of Rio's faded shirt, and a palm rested squarely over the slow, steady rhythm of Rio's heartbeat.</p><p>It was <em>her</em> palm, pressing into Rio's sternum, weighed down by something warm.</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched as she gaped at the second hand atop hers. With darker skin and slightly calloused fingertips, heavier than her own. Holding her in place like an anchor, fingers curled slightly around the edge of her palm as if letting her move away wasn't an option.</p><p>They had held hands before, during the dinner with Evanora or at the gala, but that was a choice, a calculated move to ensure credibility. Here, in the soft light of the morning, with the air still heavy with the warmth of sleep and their shared breath, there were no witnesses, expectation, or contracts.</p><p>Just Agatha subconsciously reaching out to feel Rio's heartbeat in her sleep. To make sure the woman was safe and alive, while dreaming about losing her.</p><p>Moving seemed impossible. The weight of Rio's hand over hers rooted Agatha to the spot, a quiet insistence that she stay. But it wasn't just their hands.</p><p>Sometime during the night, the cautious canyon Agatha had left between them had vanished, swallowed by the gravitational pull of shared warmth and unconscious trust. Her right leg - the one she'd stubbornly planted outside the blanket like a tether to rationality - had traitorously wormed its way beneath the covers, slipping between Rio's calves as if it had every right to.</p><p>The contact jolted her out of the surprised stupor.</p><p>Shorts. Rio was wearing shorts, or at least pants short enough to uncover her lower legs. Her skin was smooth, warm, and entirely too enticing.</p><p>Agatha tensed her leg, wanting to remove it as quickly as possible, when she felt her knee press further into a warm thigh. She'd stopped mid-sling, as if her sleeping body had been moments away from climbing on top of Rio.</p><p>Her cheeks burned from the realization, her muscles going slack, refusing to cooperate as she wrestled with what she wanted and should do.</p><p>She should move.</p><p>She should absolutely fucking move.</p><p>This was wrong on so many levels, she couldn't even focus on one.</p><p>A soft grunt cut through the silence, and she turned her head on the pillow, just enough to catch a glimpse of Rio's profile. Her brow was relaxed in sleep, lips parted slightly, hair partially loosened from its ponytail. The bandage still hugged her forehead, but didn't blend in with her skin anymore, the color returning to her face. She looked peaceful. Vulnerable in a way Agatha wasn't used to seeing.</p><p>The heat pulsed against her palm, the unmistakable thrum of life accompanied by the regular rise and fall of Rio's chest that now matched Agatha's breath for breath. That steady, silent rhythm crawled into her bones and demanded she acknowledge what she had been trying so hard to ignore.</p><p>The warmth wasn't just physical. It was emotional. <em>Dangerous.</em></p><p>She could feel the faint flutter of Rio's heartbeat under her hand, the same pulse she had clung to in her nightmare, silently begging it not to stop.</p><p>Now, in the soft hush of early morning, with golden light leaking through the blinds and painting the room in gentle tones, the truth Agatha's mind had uttered reluctantly in the dead of night gained inescapable weight.</p><p>Not just a passable desire she could stifle down.</p><p>Not a product of the dry spell, tricky lighting, and simple biology.</p><p>This, this was bone-deep.</p><p>The possessiveness, the trust, the fucking worry hadn't sprouted from something as flimsy as attraction. They weren't passing symptoms of proximity. No, they were rooted in the deepest crevices of Agatha's chest, places she hadn't even known existed until Rio had slipped through the cracks in her armor like sunlight through old blinds.</p><p>She had barged into Agatha's life with puppy-like eyes and infuriating calm. With gentle teasing and careless touches that meant everything. With her quiet understanding, her maddening patience, and that uncanny, dangerous ability to see through every defense Agatha had spent years reinforcing.</p><p>And Agatha just... let her.</p><p>Let her fit into the life she'd built to be impenetrable. Into her heart that was now raw and uncovered, drowning in the hardest of truths.</p><p>She had feelings for Rio.</p><p>Complicated, unwanted feelings she could not write off as lust or loneliness.</p><p>Because when had desire ever made her feel safe?</p><p>When had wanting someone ever come with trust?</p><p>Agatha's throat tightened, something traitorous clawing its way up. She wanted to laugh, or cry, or maybe bury herself deeper into the bed and never face what this meant. That her carefully constructed plan, built on logic and strategy, had been undone by the very person she'd chosen to ensure distance.</p><p>By Rio, who kept breathing steadily beside her, blissfully unaware.</p><p>She stayed frozen in the moment, her mind struggling to carry the importance of the realization that couldn't be softened even by the gentle lighting. The weight pressed into her chest, heavy with meaning. Terrifying in its clarity.</p><p>Fuck the yoga and martial arts. How was she supposed to survive ten months of this sharp-edged tenderness twisting in her? How could she look at Rio again, painfully aware of what she felt and unable to do anything about it?</p><p>How the fuck did one move on from something like <em>this</em>?</p><p>The first logical step was to disentangle herself from Rio and flee the room. Possibly the country.</p><p>With the precision of a neurosurgeon, Agatha maneuvered her leg away from Rio's. The room remained motionless, cloaked in silence, yet the relentless pounding in her temples magnified every rustle of fabric until even the smallest movement felt deafening. She cringed as her knee separated from the lean heat of Rio's thigh, the absence immediate and aching.</p><p>Ridiculous, she scolded herself, burying the longing before it could unfurl. Her focus narrowed to her hand, still splayed across Rio's chest, still anchored. Slowly, deliberately, she unclenched her fingers, releasing the soft fold of Rio's shirt caught between them. Her hand moved back, inch by inch, until it slipped free from under Rio's with reluctant finality.</p><p>Rio didn't so much as stir.</p><p>Agatha sat up, careful not to let the shifting mattress betray her, and rubbed her hands over her face as if she could wipe away everything she'd just felt.</p><p>Get up, move, <em>focus.</em></p><p>She rose to her feet and padded out of the room, each step mechanical and grounding, the cold floor expelling the warmth clinging to her like smoke. The familiar routine took over - check the emails while the coffee maker whirs to life, prepare Nicky's lunch before making sure he got up.</p><p>The ache didn't leave. It just tucked itself neatly beneath the surface again, into the vault where Agatha had kept it sealed for weeks until the night pried the door open, destroying the lock. It took on the shape of a warm hand resting atop hers and a heartbeat that wasn't her own.</p><p>By the time she had snapped Nicky's Minecraft lunchbox shut - courtesy of Rio, of course - the familiar movements lulled her into a false sense of security. In the kitchen, she could pretend she hadn't spent the night coming to earth-shattering conclusions about her fake wife. She could pretend she didn't know what Rio looked like in the dim lighting of the early morning.</p><p>She could pretend she didn't want to see it ever again.</p><p>The house roused slowly, the soft patter of feet on the stairs urging her out of the stupor and back into the present, where she stood with fingers clenched around her favorite mug, the coffee sloshing unsteadily from her trembling hands.</p><p>"Hi, Mama," Nicky muttered, still rubbing the sleep out of his eyes as he rounded the island. His bleary gaze slid over her robe and tousled hair. "You're not dressed."</p><p>"I'm working from home today," she explained, unfurling her fingers before her grip could shatter the ceramic.</p><p>Nicky perked up at the words. "To take care of Rio? Is she okay? Can I see her?"</p><p>Agatha flinched under the onslaught of questions, handing him a plate with scrambled eggs. Breakfasts were usually toast or cereal, the morning rush leaving little time for anything more complicated, but she needed something to keep her hands busy. The eggs were a necessary sacrifice.</p><p>"She's still asleep," she ignored the churning in her gut, reminding her of the inevitable, and followed Nicky to the dining table, coffee in hand. There was no way she could stomach anything solid with the nausea gripping her throat.</p><p>Nicky dug into his breakfast, clearly not sharing her anxiety. "Do you think she'll feel better for my game?"</p><p>Shit, she forgot about that. The topic had resurfaced a few times since their prolonged stay at Wanda's, eventually leading to Nicky taking matters into his hands and inviting Rio without considering his mother's sanity.</p><p>Rio, to her credit, had immediately checked in with Agatha to make sure she was on board, but under the scrutiny of Nicky's best puppy dog eyes, Agatha had no choice but to agree. The only good thing that came out of the arrangement was that they could treat it as one of the 'dates' they had decided were necessary, but hadn't gotten around to discussing yet.</p><p>In light of recent revelations, Agatha was thankful for her son's insistence. Sitting across from Rio in a candle-lit restaurant was the last thing she needed. The bleachers were much safer.</p><p>"I'm not sure," she said, choosing her words carefully. "The cheering can get intense, and she's not supposed to be in loud places."</p><p>"But the game's on Sunday," Nicky noticed quickly. "You said two days."</p><p>Agatha sighed, drumming her fingers against the mug. "Two days without screens, not to heal entirely," Nicky's mouth snapped open again, another retort forming on his tongue, but Agatha kept talking. "I know you're excited about Rio seeing you play, I'm sure she is too, but we have to think about her health, alright?"</p><p>Nicky jabbed his fork into the eggs more forcefully, an upset frown pulling at his lips.</p><p>"There will be other games," she added gently, relieved when the stubborn tension in Nicky's shoulders lessened.</p><p>He chewed in silence for a moment before muttering, "I just wanted us to go together."</p><p>Agatha's fingers stilled around the coffee mug.</p><p>"You know," he looked up from his plate, eyes thoughtful. "Like a family."</p><p>The words hit Agatha harder than he probably meant them to. There was no accusation in his voice, no malice, just plain honesty only children could produce.</p><p>"Nicky..." she said, unsure of what she should say. Her heart and mind pulled her in two painfully different directions, tearing her in half.</p><p>"I know it's different," he added quickly, like he hadn't meant to open the floodgates but decided to go with the flow. "And I know Rio's not like, <em>technically</em>, my family. You know, blood or something. But she kinda is, and we never do things just the three of us. I thought it'd be nice."</p><p>Agatha stared at him blankly, her mind almost caving under all the implications.</p><p>Just the three of us. Like a family.</p><p>The words echoed in her mind, cruel in their innocence. Since the day Rio and Nicky had built the raised bed, Agatha hadn't let her thoughts stray in that direction again. Thinking in those categories was dangerous. Imagining permanence could be damning.</p><p>Because Rio wasn't with them to <em>stay</em>.</p><p>The deal was temporary and transactional: Rio needed money, and Agatha needed to win against her mother. Simple on paper, manageable in theory.</p><p>But Nicky didn't know that.</p><p>All he knew was that there was another adult in his life, helping him with homework, teaching him new things, and listening to his ramblings about video games with an enthusiastic smile. Somebody who looked at him with the kind of softness he associated with care.</p><p>It was dangerous.</p><p>Not just for her heart, which, if she were honest, had already folded in ways she didn't know how to manage, but for <em>Nicky's</em>. He was a child. He couldn't suspect the quiet devastation that would follow Rio's leaving. He wasn't ready for the ache that would ripple through their home like a fault line splitting the foundation.</p><p>Truthfully, neither was Agatha.</p><p>Her eyes slowly traveled back to his face, her lower lip trembling.</p><p>She couldn't tell him. Rio was a temporary fixture in their lives, but Nicky was already too attached to understand.</p><p>And Agatha was too attached to say it out loud.</p><p>So, like a coward, she nodded.</p><p>"You're right. We don't do things together often."</p><p>She didn't say <em>as a family</em>. The word felt too loaded, too fragile on her tongue. Like naming it might make it real, even though it wasn't.</p><p>Nicky gave her a small, hopeful smile before popping another bite into his mouth, unaware of the grenade he'd just dropped at the center of her chest.</p><p>Agatha stared down at her coffee, the smooth surface contrasting against the chaos swirling in her chest. She felt unmoored, adrift in a sea of feelings she couldn't name, much less control. Affection. Guilt. <em>Fear</em>.</p><p>Rio had never asked to be a part of this.</p><p>She'd agreed to play a role, to step into Agatha's world, help her fight a battle, and then step back out once the curtain fell with quiet finality. But now, she was woven into everything: Nicky's routines, Agatha's evenings, the warmth of shared silence, and the pull of something deeper than she dared to admit.</p><p>And when she left, when she <em>had to</em> go-</p><p>Agatha didn't know how to unspool that. Didn't know how to teach her son how to stop loving someone who had never promised to stay to begin with.</p><p>She offered Nicky a gentle smile, the kind that stretched the skin around her mouth uncomfortably and didn't reach her eyes, and shoved the feelings aside. "We can have a movie night," she said softly. "Once Rio's allowed to look at screens. Just the three of us."</p><p>Nicky brightened again, and the sight of his eyes, wide and trusting, hit her like a gut punch.</p><p>She should have predicted the outcome. She should have realized Nicky would get attached to Rio, leading to inevitable heartbreak once the deal expired. But, at the same time, she knew she couldn't have. She couldn't have known how well Rio would fit into their lives or how easy it would be to get attached to her.</p><p>If she had, she would have pulled the plug on the arrangement before it could come to life.</p><p>Agatha stood, gathering her half-finished mug and his empty plate, the motion automatic. She put them in the dishwasher with trembling hands, listening to Nicky's voice as he hummed a tune under his breath, a song Rio had been playing around the house nonstop for the past three days.</p><p>She pressed her fingers against the edge of the counter and breathed.</p><p>Ten months.</p><p>Ten months of pretending, of proximity, of everything Rio had become. And after that?</p><p>She didn't have an answer.</p><p>She only knew that when Rio left, it wouldn't just be one heart breaking. It would be two.</p><hr/><p>When Wanda came to collect Nicky, announcing her arrival with a short honk, Agatha didn't bother to walk out of the house to greet her. She kissed the crown of her son's head, helped him with his backpack, and held the door open as he skipped down the porch steps toward Wanda's car. All she could muster was a brief, uncommitted wave in her best friend's direction, paired with a fake smile that made Wanda look at her through the side window questioningly.</p><p>Agatha ignored the look, retreating into the house and closing the door with a tired sigh. Another long, dreadful conversation was brewing, but she didn't have the mental capacity to think about it. She would worry about it later, after she got through the next forty-eight hours of being trapped in the house with Rio.</p><p>Speaking of-</p><p>She glanced toward the staircase.</p><p>A part of her hoped she wouldn't have to face Rio yet. That she could drag her feet and avoid pretending she hadn't realized something enormous and terrifying in the middle of the night for even an hour longer. It wouldn't change anything. The knowledge would still sit heavy on her chest, inescapable like Rio's presence for the next two days. Rio couldn't know. The feelings couldn't go anywhere other than another lockbox shoved to the back of her mind.</p><p>Still, she found herself moving toward the guest room, quiet in her approach. Rio's well-being was her responsibility now, handed over to her in the form of a cheerful, too-bright pamphlet, complete with bold fonts and a cartoon brain that grinned beside words like <em>concussion protocol</em> and <em>risk of hemorrhage.</em> She'd read it twice the night before, memorizing warning signs.</p><p>She hovered at the door, fingers pausing on the handle a beat too long, caught in the limbo between duty and the urge to lock herself in the office until everything returned to normal. Then she pushed it open and stepped into the dim stillness of the room.</p><p>Nothing had changed. The curtains remained drawn, casting faint ribbons of light across the wooden floor. They crept forward like delicate fingers, stretching toward the bed and spilling over the folds of the green covers, over the shape of Rio's sleeping form.</p><p>She had moved since Agatha left - turned to her side, one arm extended across the mattress as if reaching for something lost in sleep. Or someone. The sheets were tangled, creased in the outline of absence, and the quiet intimacy of it nearly made her turn around, but her eyes caught on the bandage, making her stomach churn.</p><p>It had shifted slightly, a few black strands of hair curling over the edge. A small, rust-colored dot had bloomed through the gauze, faint but undeniable. Right over the place where the skin had been split open and sewn shut.</p><p>Agatha took an involuntary step forward, the protective urge roaring in her chest like a second heartbeat. Not just duty or concern, but something else. Something dangerous.</p><p>She crouched by the bed, eyes scanning Rio's face, searching for pallor, for strain, for any other sign that things had turned quietly, fatally wrong in the hour she'd been gone. But Rio looked the same, warm under the hush of sleep, her breath steady, lashes casting shadows on her cheekbones. Safe, healing, and alive.</p><p>Still, Agatha stared at that single dot of blood like it had whispered betrayal. Like it was proof she hadn't done enough. Had Rio moved too much? Pulled the stitches in her sleep? Was that thin dressing hiding a slow, silent bleed?</p><p>She leaned closer, heart knocking against her ribs. Her hand trembled as she reached for the edge of the gauze, unsure what she would do once her fingers touched the material.</p><p>And then, a flicker of movement.</p><p>A soft fluttering of lashes accompanied by a twitching brow before two bleary brown eyes blinked open, unfocused and confused, landing on Agatha's hovering hand before moving to her face.</p><p>Agatha didn't move, caught and exposed in a moment she couldn't lie her way out of.</p><p>Rio squinted, her voice thick with sleep. "...Did I die?"</p><p>Agatha blinked. "What?"</p><p>"You look like you're about to cry," Rio murmured, frowning faintly. "Or say last goodbyes over an open casket."</p><p>Agatha rose from the awkward position, relief washing over her in a calming wave. If Rio's questionable sense of humor was still intact, she had to be fine.</p><p>"You're bleeding," she said quietly, gesturing toward the bandage.</p><p>Rio hummed, closing her eyes as if the news didn't matter. "It could be from yesterday."</p><p>It wasn't. Agatha knew that because she'd spent most of the night staring at the bandage and having epiphanies about the conflicting feelings that resurfaced at the stark reminder of Rio's condition.</p><p>But she couldn't say <em>that</em>.</p><p>Instead, she cleared her throat and stepped away from the bed, keeping her voice even as she spoke. "I'll bring you the meds and some breakfast. I can rewrap the wound before I start work."</p><p>That seemed to get Rio's attention. Her eyelids fluttered open again, her eyes sharper than before as she took in Agatha's robe and pajamas peeking out from between the lapels.</p><p>"What time is it? Shouldn't you be on your way already?" she asked, hand automatically reaching toward the nightstand.</p><p>"No screens," Agatha reminded her, pointing toward the other side of the bed where Rio's phone remained throughout the night. "And it's a little after eight. I'm working from home for the next few days."</p><p>Rio frowned, carefully maneuvering her body to lean against the headboard. "You didn't have to do that."</p><p>"Lilia's orders," Agatha shrugged as if she hadn't planned on staying home anyway, inching toward the door. Her movements felt rigid, her spine too stiff, and her muscles too tense. She needed distance, breathing room to handle the emotions coiling in her chest like hissing snakes.</p><p>Her hand brushed the doorway, feet carrying her out of the room like a rat abandoning a sinking ship, when Rio's soft voice stopped her.</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>It shot a bolt of electricity down her spine, effectively freezing her in her place. Her brain ricocheted the word until it shifted, no longer said in the steady voice but a faint whisper.</p><p>"<em>Agatha</em>. <em>Please. Stay.</em>"</p><p>Said like a prayer. Like a plea.</p><p>She turned despite herself, eyes falling into warm pools of brown. Rio tilted her head, studying her with that quiet thoughtfulness she had when she suspected more than she let on.</p><p>Agatha hated that look. It never failed to make her feel exposed.</p><p>"Thanks," Rio said, taking Agatha by surprise. She expected an argument, another back and forth of <em>I don't need your help</em> and <em>I don't care, I'm still helping</em>. Somehow, the easy surrender felt worse. It meant Rio had stopped resisting her - had decided to accept the help, probably realizing the fight was futile in light of Agatha's stubbornness.</p><p>Agatha nodded, already halfway out the door. "I'll be right back."</p><p>Then she slipped out of the room, feeling Rio's eyes at the back of her neck like burning lasers.</p><p>The tray wasn't heavy, but Agatha carried it like it might tip under the weight of implication. She balanced a mug of tea, a glass of water, toast with a thick layer of butter - enough to clog an artery, just how Rio liked it - and a small bowl of sliced fruit. The painkillers sat in a neat pile beside the plate, accusing her with their silence.</p><p>She nudged the door open with her shoulder.</p><p>Rio looked up from where she was still propped against the headboard, her gaze sharper, more awake, but soft at the edges. The room smelled faintly of her perfume and eucalyptus.</p><p>Agatha moved silently, setting the tray on the nightstand and taking a step back under Rio's watchful gaze. The quiet lingered, making her hands move uselessly at her sides, itching to do anything. She didn't want to hover, didn't want her actions to reflect what she had realized during the night.</p><p>"Eat first," she said evenly, pointing toward the food. "You shouldn't take the meds on an empty stomach. Then I'll change the bandage."</p><p>Rio obeyed without complaint, reaching for the plate and biting into a piece of toast with her eyes still trained on Agatha. Like she knew something. Like she could sense it.</p><p>Agatha turned on her heel again, wordlessly walking out of the room to fetch the small first aid kit she had learned to keep around after one too many scraped knees. Nicky was an overall cautious child, not very prone to injuries, but whenever the twins were around, the carefulness flew out the window, leading to bruises and cuts she had to tend to.</p><p>When she rejoined Rio, the woman was nibbling on an apple slice, the toast and meds gone from the tray, and the cup of tea half-empty. Her eyes were trained on her phone, still lying on the nightstand, occasionally lighting up with new notifications. Agatha had put it on silent the night before, almost driven mad by the amount of texts Rio had been getting.</p><p>"I know it's against the doctor's orders," Rio said slowly as if testing the waters. "But I need to check my phone. Billy promised to let my abuela know I'm fine, but..."</p><p>Agatha's face twisted with anger before she could help it, the dread from seeing Rio squint at the screen the night before resurfacing.</p><p>She quickly reminded herself she had no right to tell Rio what to do. She was an adult, capable of making her own decisions, and Agatha was - what? Her fake wife? Somebody harboring an unwarranted crush? Neither of those things gave her the privilege of telling Rio what was best for her, even if it came from a place of care.</p><p>Wordlessly, Agatha moved to the other side of the bed and retrieved the phone, handing it to Rio without looking at her face. Then, just as silently, she started fiddling with the first aid kit, unzipping it and rummaging through the contents with more concentration than necessary.</p><p>She almost jumped when Rio's voice sounded in the room, warm and light.</p><p>"<em>Hola, abuela.</em>"</p><p>Agatha focused on laying out the essential items, cramming them on the bedside table next to the tray. The steady flow of Spanish filled her ears, but her knowledge of the language wasn't remotely enough to make out more than a few buzzwords, one of which was her name, thrown into a long sentence she couldn't understand.</p><p>It dawned on her that she'd never asked Rio what her family thought of the sudden marriage. She didn't even know if Rio had told them about it. She must have said <em>something</em>, though, right? Otherwise, Agatha's name wouldn't come up in the conversation so effortlessly, as if she'd been a recurring topic during those calls.</p><p>But how much did Rio's grandmother know? Could Rio have told her about the deal, the money, and the temporality of the agreement? Or had she convinced her family that they were in love and married for a reason as simple as wanting to share a life?</p><p>Rio's impatient voice snapped her out of the spiral. "<em>No, eso no hace falta. ¿Por qué? Porque estoy bien. ¿Le vas a creer más a una desconocida que a mí?</em>"</p><p>There was some mumbling on the other end of the call, and Rio clenched her jaw, looking up at the ceiling as if praying for patience. "<em>Está bien. Se lo voy a preguntar</em>," she grumbled, eyes snapping to Agatha. "She wants to talk to you."</p><p>Agatha blinked, hands stilling over the items arranged on the bedside table. "What?"</p><p>"She wants to know I'm fine and won't take my word for it."</p><p>Well, Agatha couldn't blame the woman. Considering Rio's behavior at the hospital, it was easy to guess she tended to downplay her injuries, and her grandmother had to know that.</p><p>"Alright," she said, more hesitant than she intended. Before she could second-guess her decision, the phone was already in her hand, a picture of a serious woman with graying hair and Rio's eyes staring back at her. She pressed the receiver to her ear, swallowing thickly. "Hello?"</p><p>"You're Agatha?"</p><p>The voice was gruff, slightly raspy, but carried undertones of warmth, enhanced by the thick accent. The authoritative lilt made Agatha stand up straighter.</p><p>"Yes. You must be Rio's grandmother."</p><p>"Maria Vidal," the woman introduced herself. "Is she okay?"</p><p>Agatha smiled at the genuine worry in her tone. "She has a concussion and a cut on her head, but she's okay. She should be perfectly fine in a few days."</p><p>Maria exhaled slowly as if she'd been holding her breath for a long time. "And you're taking care of her?"</p><p>"Yes," she answered without hesitating, eyes skimming over the medical supplies and the half-empty tray before landing on Rio's impatient face. "I'll take care of her as long as she lets me."</p><p>There was a pause on the line, the kind that lingered just long enough to feel weighted.</p><p>"You sound tired," Maria said gently. "But serious."</p><p>Agatha blinked, unsure which part startled her more. Apparently, the entire Vidal family had a knack for reading her like an open book.</p><p>"I am," she admitted, because there wasn't any point in pretending otherwise. "It's been a long night."</p><p>Another pause, then a soft hum of understanding. "My granddaughter is stubborn. She will pretend she is fine even if her head is falling off her shoulders. You'll have to be smarter than her about it."</p><p>An amused huff escaped before Agatha could help herself. "That's what I've been trying to do."</p><p>"Well," Maria's voice warmed around the edges, "then I think she chose right."</p><p>Agatha's throat tightened.</p><p>
<em>Chose.</em>
</p><p>It wasn't real. They hadn't chosen each other, not in the sense Maria thought. They'd fallen into an arrangement out of logic and strategy. And yet here Maria was, believing in something solid and intentional. Believing her granddaughter had chosen someone who would care for her in the way she deserved.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, who was watching her with a raised brow and a silent question in her eyes. She probably couldn't hear what Maria was saying and was confused by Agatha's perplexed expression.</p><p>"I'll call again tomorrow," Maria said. "Rio tells me she can't use phones, so send me your number, <em>si</em>?"</p><p>"Yes, ma'am," Agatha said, her voice steadier than she felt.</p><p>"Good. Now give me my granddaughter before she throws something."</p><p>That earned a small laugh from both women. Agatha passed the phone back to Rio, who snatched it with a muttered "<em>dramática</em>" and rolled her eyes skyward as she brought it to her ear again.</p><p>Agatha turned back to the bedside table, resuming her overzealous rearranging of bandages and ointments. She didn't need to. Everything was already in order, but her hands needed something to do. Something to keep her grounded while her insides churned with the echo of Maria's words.</p><p>
<em>She chose right.</em>
</p><p>When Rio hung up a minute later and set the phone aside, she didn't let the silence settle.</p><p>"She likes you," Rio said lightly, stretching her legs under the blanket.</p><p>Agatha didn't look at her, too busy snapping on sterile gloves. The rubber clung uncomfortably to her sweaty palms. "She doesn't know me."</p><p>"She thinks she does," Rio replied. "She says you sound like someone who doesn't lie."</p><p>"Then you've clearly never told her what I do for a living," Agatha said, her voice even. She couldn't let Maria's words get to her - couldn't allow herself the luxury of thinking what it would be like to be chosen by Rio for real and not for show.</p><p>Rio stared at her, a subtle crease forming between her eyebrows, and Agatha clenched her jaw, feeling exposed. She had to get out of this fucking room before Rio's warm eyes coaxed her into that familiar cocoon of security that never failed to lower her defences.</p><p>"I have a meeting in twenty minutes," she added more urgently, motioning to the bandage. "Sit up straighter."</p><p>The crease deepened as Rio obeyed, pushing off the pillows to allow Agatha access to the dressing. Willing her hands to remain steady, she began to unfurl the soft cotton, awkwardly towering over Rio. She couldn't sit on the bed. With everything that had happened in the past twenty-four hours, something as intimate as tending to Rio's wound with her body heat pressed against her hip felt like asking for trouble.</p><p>Especially if Rio kept looking at her like that, worried as if Agatha was the one with a bruised brain.</p><p>The blood had dried, turning dark and sticking to the untouched stitches. Agatha peeled the gauze off methodically, keeping her expression unreadable as she spoke.</p><p>"You didn't pull anything," she murmured, needing to fill the silence before it consumed her. "It's just surface."</p><p>Rio didn't answer, just kept on watching her.</p><p>Agatha dabbed the area gently with antiseptic, then reached for fresh gauze, folding it into neat layers. Her fingers were precise, but not tender. Detached and professional like the steady hands of a doctor patching up a stranger.</p><p>"Did something happen?" Rio's voice was quiet, but it broke through the silence like a match strike.</p><p>Agatha froze for half a second. "No."</p><p>"You're acting like something did."</p><p>"I'm just worried about work," she said, securing the tape with a final press. "You should rest."</p><p>She stepped back, peeling the gloves from her hands and stuffing them into the empty wrapper that had held the gauze with a little more force than necessary.</p><p>"I was careful," Rio added. "I tried not to move too much."</p><p>"You didn't pull anything," Agatha repeated.</p><p>"Did I do something at night then?" Rio asked, tilting her head. "Because you can't be mad at me over something I did while unconscious. Those are the rules."</p><p>It was an attempt at lessening the tension swirling between them, a familiar tactic Rio used whenever she sensed Agatha needed breathing room. Agatha usually took the out, matching Rio's playful tone and engaging in a meaningless back-and-forth.</p><p>But now, all she could think about was the weight of Rio's palm on top of hers. The steady heartbeat pushing into her palm, in tune with her own, like it was natural to be so close.</p><p>She couldn't say <em>Seeing you reach for me in your sleep this morning almost undid me.</em> Or <em>I think I might be more afraid of what this is becoming than I am of your injury</em>. Or <em>I watched you breathe and realized I never want to stop.</em></p><p>Instead, she said, "You're fine. Stop worrying."</p><p>Rio's frown deepened. "Are <em>you</em> fine?"</p><p>Agatha swallowed, forcing a smile. "I'm great. I'll be in my office if you need me."</p><p>She turned without waiting for a response, each step away from the bed taut and deliberate, as if leaving fast enough might erase what was said. Or unsaid.</p><p>Rio didn't call after her, but the silence, heavy with confusion, followed her down the corridor, slipping into the office with her.</p><p>With her back pressed to the closed door, Agatha exhaled shakily, the sound catching in her throat. Her head thudded gently against the wood, eyes lifting to the ceiling as if the bland stretch of white might offer some answers. Her laptop sat on the desk across the room, the screen glowing insistently, bathing the space in a faint blue light. The document Billy had sent her, simple notes for the call, arranged in familiar bullet points, waited for her patiently.</p><p>But she couldn't move.</p><p>She had feelings for Rio.</p><p>She had feelings for the woman she'd married to outmaneuver her mother. The woman who left her sneakers in the hallway and books on the table, who couldn't exist in a space without background noise, and who countered Agatha's sarcasm with wit and laughter.</p><p>The woman who'd moved into her house with a truck full of plants and a contract. Who said yes to the fake marriage for a check.</p><p>Agatha's stomach turned.</p><p>Some part of her, however small, had started to forget the terms of their arrangement. Had started to imagine Rio in the kitchen because she wanted to be there. Rio transforming the garden to see it change with the seasons and reap the fruits of her labor for years to come. Rio reaching for her in the night because-</p><p>No. No fucking chance. That wasn't real. That was her projecting, letting comfort blur the edges of a transaction.</p><p>Rio didn't want her.</p><p>She was charming, sure. Warm. Attentive, in that effortless, silent way. But Agatha wasn't stupid. She knew the nature of their arrangement called for it - for Rio to remain civil whenever Agatha was anything but, to withstand Agatha's overall unpleasantness to make the lie work.</p><p>She knew Rio wouldn't be there if not for the promise of a million dollars.</p><p>After all, who would deal with that, with <em>her</em>, without compensation? Certainly not the previous people she had an <em>actual </em>relationship with. The handful of women who had eventually decided she was too detached, too assertive, too <em>damaged</em> to build a life with.</p><p>It was transactional. It had always been transactional.</p><p>And Agatha? She'd let herself forget that. Let herself soften and want something that wasn't hers to begin with. Like a fucking teenager imagining a future with her crush just because she had to sit next to her in class when there were no other seats left.</p><p>She dropped her head into her hands, fingertips pressing hard into her brow. The pressure didn't stop the ache behind her eyes, didn't muffle the bitter voice whispering all the ways she was setting herself up for humiliation. Because what came next? What did she think would happen if she let this thing grow?</p><p>That Rio would suddenly look at her and decide she wanted her? That she'd choose to stay, not because of contract or a check, but because she'd somehow found something lovable in all the sharp edges and restraint?</p><p>No. Life didn't work like that. Not for her.</p><p>Agatha had been wanted for her brain, her money, her connections, even her looks. But never for herself. Not for the messy, closed-off, impossible parts. And Rio was too bright to settle for someone who didn't know how to make space for softness. She was too alive to tether herself to someone whose love felt like obligation disguised as protection.</p><p>And Agatha didn't know how to unlearn that. Didn't know how to be someone who could ask for love and not flinch at the idea of returning it.</p><p>So she wouldn't ask. She couldn't.</p><p>She had to hold her line - for her own sake if not for Rio's. Keep her hands busy, her mouth guarded, and her thoughts firmly out of reach.</p><p>Because if she kept slipping,  if she let Rio's laugh settle into the corners of this house like it belonged there, if she let herself believe that hand stretching toward her in sleep meant something more, it would ruin her.</p><p>She would fall, and Rio would leave, and she'd be left with nothing but the echo of a life she'd never truly had. She'd have to wipe away Nicky's tears while holding her own at bay, mourning the loss of someone who'd never promised to stay.</p><p>Agatha straightened, jaw set. She would be polite. Helpful. Distant.</p><p>She would be everything she needed to make it through the next few months without losing her mind.</p><p>And then, when it was over, she'd let Rio go, the way she'd always known she would.</p><p>Because this wasn't real.</p><p>And the sooner she remembered that, the better.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hi again! So, Agatha finally realized she'd been basically gaslighting herself for a few chapters. I'd love to say it gets easier from here, but... does it? We'll see (unless you get bored with the very roundabout road they're taking before falling into each other's arms, in which case, I don't really blame you, these two are impossible, and yes, I'm aware I'm literally the one controlling their actions). Also, an announcement (not a good one), the next week's chapter should appear at the usual time, but it may not. I've been slammed lately and burned through all the chapters I had ready. I'm sorry, I'll do my best to keep with the schedule, and in case I don't, thank you for your patience. And, as always, thank you for all the kudos (I think we're nearing 1500?!) and the comments, I love reading them. See you (hopefully) next week!</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Staying holed up in her office offered a short reprieve from what, or rather <em>who</em>, awaited on the other side of the oak door. Agatha buried herself in meetings, jotted down notes she'd never revisit, and cleared out emails she'd ignored for a week. Anything to keep her hands busy. Her mind, unfortunately, refused to cooperate.</p><p>No matter how many times she forced her eyes back to the screen, her ears betrayed her, straining for the soft creak of floorboards or the shuffle of blankets coming from the guest bedroom. She even cracked the office door open, telling herself it was to air out the room. The breeze that spilled through did little to cool the heat crawling up her neck.</p><p>She told herself it was concern. A sense of duty, maybe. The doctor had said to keep an eye on Rio, and since she couldn't do that, all she had left was listening. But she knew - <em>God</em>, she knew - that wasn't why her thoughts roamed the halls like ghosts and always ended up just outside Rio's door.</p><p>This wasn't worry. This was <em>longing</em>.</p><p>And wasn't that pathetic? One night, sharing a bed platonically, and suddenly, her heart was staging fantasies like some repressed teenager, already halfway down the aisle because the popular girl smiled at her during lunch.</p><p>Jesus, she had to stop comparing herself to a lovesick teenager. And to get a fucking grip.</p><p>She exhaled harshly and rubbed her eyes, thumb pressing against the bridge of her nose beneath the glasses. The spiraling last night <em>and</em> again this morning had been more than enough. She had already labeled the tightness in her chest and the pull in her gut as a crush, and although using the word didn't help with the 'stop comparing yourself to a lovesick teenager' thing, it made something else clear. Crushes were fleeting. Manageable.</p><p><em>They faded</em>.</p><p>And so would this one.</p><p>She had a plan, worked out somewhere between sitting through meetings and trying not to think about Rio. She would pretend everything was fine, stay professional, and revert to the careful rhythm she'd worked out at the beginning of the arrangement - distant and impersonal.</p><p>It felt flimsy at the edges. Trying to reverse what had developed between them wasn't just difficult - it felt <em>unnatural, </em>like trying to shove something living into a box that it had long since outgrown.</p><p>Still, it was necessary. Because only <em>she</em> felt that way - about Rio, about whatever was between them. And Agatha wasn't about to risk the deal, or worse, her <em>dignity</em>, by forgetting about that.</p><p>A door creaked somewhere down the hall, and Agatha jolted upright like a soldier caught dozing mid-watch. After everything that had happened, the smartest thing she could do was flee the house and lose herself in work, giving herself room to breathe. But that wasn't an option. Not for the next week, at least.</p><p>No, she was trapped. Trapped with the one person she most needed space from, now requiring round-the-clock care. It was a cruel joke. To tend to Rio - dress her wounds, monitor her meds, feed her - without letting any of it touch her.</p><p>Without letting <em>her</em> touch her.</p><p>But Agatha hadn't spent most of her life shunning her emotions and building up walls to be defeated by a meager <em>crush</em>.</p><p>The door clicked shut almost inaudibly as if the person closing it was hoping to slip away unnoticed, and Agatha stood up from her chair before she could think better. Her feet carried her down the hall, toward the staircase, where Rio was balancing on the first step, hand wrapped tightly around the railing bolted to the wall.</p><p>Agatha froze. "What exactly do you think you're doing?"</p><p>The words came out calm and clipped, carefully stripped of the panic coiling in her spine at the sight of Rio swaying slightly under her own weight.</p><p>"It's after lunch," Rio grumbled without turning. Her grip on the handrail tightened as she took another step. "I'm gonna make something."</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. She'd hoped the painkillers would make Rio more agreeable - sleepy, compliant, easier to keep at arm's length. But of course, she'd miscalculated. Of course, Rio would be as stubborn half-drugged as she was lucid.</p><p>"You're on bed rest," Agatha said flatly.</p><p>Rio scoffed, still descending like it was a minor protest instead of reckless endangerment. "I can't use my phone, read, or even listen to music without my head feeling like it's cracking open. I'm not lying in bed all day like I'm ninety."</p><p>Agatha stepped forward and blocked the staircase, her arm braced against the wall. "Go back to bed. I'll bring you something."</p><p>For a second, neither of them moved.</p><p>Then Rio's eyes met hers, and Agatha's resolve wavered.</p><p>The medicine hadn't dulled them - those rich, focused brown eyes that somehow always saw <em>too much</em>. The stair between them gave Rio a height advantage, but what made Agatha tense wasn't Rio's physicality. It was the defiance in her jaw, the stubborn tilt of her chin, the unspoken challenge on her tongue.</p><p>She wanted to touch her. To guide her back gently. Maybe even to say <em>please.</em></p><p>But that wasn't the plan. The plan was logic. <em>Distance</em>.</p><p>"I'm not dying," Rio said, tone firm but still warm. "I can stand and walk, and my arms are fine. I can use a knife."</p><p>"Not without cutting off a finger with all the meds," Agatha snapped, fighting the surge of something too close to fear. "<em>And</em> I don't have time to spend another afternoon waiting in the ER while they stitch you up again," she stepped aside slightly to corner Rio into traveling back up the stairs without touching her. "Wanda left enough food to last two days. Lunch is covered."</p><p>It had felt like a blessing yesterday. Now it felt like a trap - one more excuse taken from her, one less reason to leave the house and escape this unrelenting awareness of Rio's presence.</p><p>With the fridge fully stocked, she had no excuse to flee at all.</p><p>Stupid Wanda and her insufferable, thoughtful nature.</p><p>"I'll reheat it, then," Rio argued, ignoring Agatha's subtle attempts at herding her back to the bedroom.</p><p>Agatha's jaw clenched. "It's a salad."</p><p>"Well," Rio's lips curved into a sly grin, "I can toss it. I'm great at that."</p><p>The warmth hit Agatha's neck fast, crawling up into her cheeks. Her stomach coiled tight, too tight, with something entirely unprofessional.</p><p>The words were light, and the tone familiarly flirtatious. Before the gala, she would've volleyed back without missing a beat, cutting enough to make Rio flush. Before yesterday, she might have rolled her eyes and let the moment slide off her like water on glass.</p><p>But now, she felt raw.</p><p>Because Rio's flirting didn't <em>mean </em>anything. It was instinct, a part of her natural charm intended to be light, easy, and ultimately empty. Not like the quiet ache Agatha was choking on.</p><p>She turned before something cracked open and spilled out, each step down the stairs deliberate and stiff with the effort to keep it together.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Rio called after her, surprise lacing her voice as if she expected Agatha to do more. More arguing, more teasing. Anything but retreat.</p><p>"Bringing you lunch," Agatha called back, taking a sharp turn to disappear behind a wall. "Go back to bed."</p><p>"The tray's still in my room!" Rio shouted after her, sounding confused.</p><p>Agatha said nothing. She just listened as the stairs creaked under Rio's shifting weight, clearly considering whether to follow or obey. Then, a heavy sigh floated down the hall like a whisper, trailing behind Agatha into the kitchen as feet shuffled back up the stairs and into the guest bedroom.</p><p>Agatha exhaled and leaned against the counter, bracing herself with one hand as if her own thoughts might knock her over.</p><p>It would pass; she knew it would. But the freshness of it - the <em>knowing,</em> the ugly clarity of how much she'd let the lines blur already - made patching up the cracks harder. She had been working on physical distance - paying close attention to her fingers whenever Rio handed her something to avoid contact, ducking out of the kitchen whenever Rio entered to minimize the risk of the woman brushing past her with a hand on her waist.</p><p>However, <em>emotional</em> distance was trickier. It was one thing to jump out of Rio's way whenever she got too close. It was something entirely different to not take the flirtatious comments for something more than easy banter.</p><p>For someone who prided herself on being impossible to read, Agatha felt exposed. Off-balance. Out of her depth.</p><p>Because now that Rio had slipped past every line of defense, Agatha couldn't figure out how to treat her like a transaction again. Like just another professional association. Like a means to an end.</p><p>Agatha straightened with a sigh, pushing off the counter like she could physically shoulder the weight in her chest. She moved through the kitchen with clinical precision, spooning the quinoa salad into a bowl and slicing a piece of bread with hands steadier than she felt. The motions helped. Gave her something to do while her mind scrambled for footholds.</p><p>With the tray still on Rio's bedside table, she balanced the bowl and a fork in one hand, grabbing a glass of water in the other before moving back toward the stairs. Each creak of the wood underfoot pierced the quiet enveloping the house, but the intrusions barely registered, her mind too loud for external noises.</p><p>She didn't knock when she pushed the door open, just entered quietly like she might catch Rio asleep and escape before she had to speak. But Rio wasn't sleeping. She was propped against the pillows, fingers drumming against the duvet, hair mussed from lying down too long.</p><p>She looked up the moment Agatha walked in.</p><p>Agatha crammed the items into the small space left on the bedside table, aware that letting Rio take them out of her hands could result in unintentional brushing of their fingers and worsen the unpleasant churning in her stomach.</p><p>Rio sat up straighter, crossing her legs under the blanket as if to make room for Agatha to sit, and reached for the salad. "That looks... healthy," she noticed, studying the diced cucumber and pepper.</p><p>"It's what Wanda left."</p><p>Agatha took the empty tray, still not meeting her gaze, and took a step back as if proximity might undo her entirely.</p><p>"You're not eating?" Rio asked, digging the fork into the salad and letting it stay there.</p><p>"I'll eat in the office. Didn't want you to drop dead from starvation."</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh, soft and fond, but it only made Agatha retreat further - physically, mentally, emotionally. She couldn't afford to be charmed, not anymore. Not with her chest still aching with everything she wasn't supposed to feel.</p><p>"We can eat downstairs, you know. Make use of that obnoxiously big table of yours," Rio said casually, toying with the fork.</p><p>"You shouldn't be on your feet for long stretches. It could bring on dizzy spells."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, probably realizing that the doctor hadn't said that during his brief tutorial on how to deal with the concussion. Aware that Agatha had put in the effort to research the topic.</p><p>"I was fine on the stairs," Rio's voice was light, but her eyes were sharp, scanning Agatha like lie detectors. "Which you knew, right? That's why you left."</p><p>It wasn't an accusation or a tricky question asked to make Agatha feel guilty, but she still did. She clenched her jaw. "Eat your food."</p><p>Rio studied her, eyes focused like she could peel back Agatha's skin and see the mess underneath. "You sure you're okay?"</p><p>"I'm fine," the lie slid out smoothly, honed from years of use.</p><p>"I don't believe you."</p><p>"You don't have to," Agatha turned toward the door, the tray wobbling slightly in her trembling hands. The empty cups, plates, and bowls rattled with the movements, revealing her unease. Unveiling the lie.</p><p>"You've been weird all day."</p><p>Agatha paused, shoulder pressed against the door to push it open. Saying <em>all day</em> was an overstatement. She hadn't talked to Rio, hadn't checked on her, since the morning. Instead, she listened for signs of life, painfully aware that the woman was in the house but unable to face her. She hid in her office like a soldier in the trenches, praying for a cease-fire.</p><p>"Rest, Rio," she said without turning. "That's all you need to worry about."</p><p>With that, she fled the room, leaving the door ajar in case Rio called after her. She didn't.</p><hr/><p>Two hours of relative peace later, Agatha slammed her laptop shut with a finality that didn't quite echo how unsettled she felt. She stacked the updated insurance plan for Rio into a tidy pile, ready for a signature that Agatha convinced herself was just as transactional as the rest of their agreement, and tried not to dwell on the ache behind her eyes.</p><p>Then she heard the footsteps.</p><p>Her hands paused mid-motion, fingertips resting on the edge of the folder as the sounds grew nearer. They weren't fading back toward the stairs but approaching her office. Her sanctuary.</p><p>She didn't freeze this time, not exactly. But every muscle in her body tensed, bracing for impact.</p><p>A soft knock landed against the wood, polite and measured.</p><p>"Can I come in?"</p><p>Agatha exhaled, steadying her voice. "Yeah."</p><p>The door opened, and Rio stepped inside, cautious but unafraid, her gaze drifting around the office as if trying to read something in the spines of Agatha's law books. But her eyes always returned to Agatha.</p><p>She looked more alive than she had before - no longer washed out by painkillers or dimmed by discomfort. But it didn't help. If anything, it made things worse. Clear-eyed Rio was a thousand times more dangerous.</p><p>Agatha didn't speak right away. The silence stretched just long enough to become noticeable.</p><p>"You needed something?" she finally asked, keeping her voice even. "I was about to get started on dinner."</p><p>"I'll come downstairs for that," Rio replied casually, moving farther into the room. "I'm not built for lying around all day. One more afternoon in bed, and I'll be climbing the walls."</p><p>"Better that than the stairs."</p><p>Rio gave a quiet laugh, and it made something twist in Agatha's chest.</p><p>She crossed to the armchair across from Agatha's desk and lowered herself onto it with a soft sigh. "The lawyer called."</p><p>Agatha nodded once, carefully. "I gave her your information. Figured you wouldn't want me handling it without your knowledge."</p><p>"I appreciate that," Rio said, fingers tapping lightly on the armrest, rhythm steady but thoughtful. "She said I don't need to press charges, technically. But my cooperation is helpful. The guy's probably looking at a few years."</p><p>"Seems about right."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, a wry smile tugging at her lips. "Not that I need to tell you that," she added, gesturing to the shelves lined with legal texts and court reports. "You probably know the sentencing guidelines by heart."</p><p>"I haven't worked on a case like that in a long time," Agatha replied coolly.</p><p>"Right," Rio said, lips curving into something smaller, almost fond. "You just <em>save billionaires from becoming millionaires</em>."</p><p>The words hit harder than they should've.</p><p>Agatha looked down, jaw tightening. That line had been funny in the garden when the sense of familiarity and belonging had been a shapeless, vague cloud that she hadn't bothered to examine. Now, it felt like a reminder of everything Agatha wasn't allowed to want.</p><p>She forced her voice to remain flat. "Seems like an open-and-shut case, though."</p><p>"Hopefully," Rio's gaze lingered, not just watching but searching, as if somewhere in Agatha's expression was the key to the shift she'd felt in the air between them.</p><p>Agatha didn't allow her to ask the question on her tongue. Instead, she set the folder still in her hands in front of Rio, pulling back the moment it hit the desk.</p><p>"I prepared the documents to add you to my insurance. All you have to do is sign."</p><p>Rio blinked, the sudden change in topic drawing her back. She looked at the documents briefly, but her eyes didn't stay there. "You don't have to do that. I'm not planning to get another chair thrown at me."</p><p>"Were you planning the one yesterday?" Agatha fired back, crossing her arms. "You agreed to go through with it."</p><p>"High on painkillers and with a bruised brain," Rio said dryly. "Shouldn't I be <em>of sound mind</em>?"</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth. It wasn't a legal deal <em>per se</em>. The rule didn't apply. But even though she'd threatened Rio to find a way to adjust the insurance without her consent, she knew she couldn't. Not without showing all the cards she'd been fighting to keep out of sight.</p><p>Going over Rio's head to change the plan surpassed the bounds of their contract, and she'd breached it too many times already, guided by her feelings and not logic. She couldn't afford that anymore.</p><p>"Just read it when you can," she said, her voice steady and uninterested. "Then decide."</p><p>Rio raised her brows, clearly caught off guard by the cold edge. Her fingers hovered over the folder before she picked it up, eyes never leaving Agatha's face. Her expression flickered, defiance warring with something quieter. Something almost like hurt.</p><p>Before she could say anything, Agatha sat up straighter, neatly folding her hands on her closed laptop. "Anything else?"</p><p>"This isn't a business meeting," Rio noticed, her voice calm but carrying an unmistakable edge.</p><p>"I didn't say it was."</p><p>"And yet, you're dismissing me like one of your employees."</p><p>Agatha swallowed down the lump growing in her throat. "If you have anything else to discuss-"</p><p>"Why are you acting like this?" Rio cut in, fingers clutching the folder, crumpling the edge as she leaned forward. "Is it because my abuela asked for your number? Did I do something wrong? Because I can't fix it if you don't tell me."</p><p>The worst part was Rio didn't seem <em>angry</em>. Not the way she'd been after Agatha's misguided assumption about her parents months ago. She didn't yell. She wasn't sarcastic. She just looked... wounded. Like she was being shoved out of something she'd only just started to believe she had a place in.</p><p>And that look - <em>fuck</em>, that look - almost undid Agatha entirely.</p><p>It made her want to confess every errant thought she'd tried to choke down since the hospital. It made her want to reach across the desk, to press her thumbs into Rio's cheeks and smooth away the furrowed tension until she smiled again. Until she forgave her.</p><p>Instead, she sighed, heavy and tired, like the conversation was a waste of her time.</p><p>"Forgive me for having a bad day," she said at last, cold as frostbite. She leaned back in her chair, arms crossed like they could shield her from the guilt clawing at her ribs. "The world doesn't revolve around you. I get that you're bored without your phone, but that doesn't mean you get to pick a fight with me."</p><p>Rio froze, and the silence that followed was deafening.</p><p>Agatha saw the words hit - the way they landed, sharp and cruel, exactly as intended. It lit a flash of something furious in Rio's eyes, the warm brown flaring with wounded heat.</p><p>"Pick a fight?" she repeated, voice low and stunned. "I'm trying to understand why you're acting like I don't exist. Like you regret-" she stopped herself, jaw tightening. "Maybe I just wanted to see what happened to the woman who refused to leave me at the hospital."</p><p>"That was part of the deal," Agatha said quickly - <em>too</em> quickly.</p><p>The lie cracked on impact.</p><p>Rio's breath caught as if the blow had been physical, delivered to her throat. She remained silent, studying Agatha for one suspended second like she was watching something important fall apart.</p><p>Then, she closed her eyes for a moment, inhaling deeply. When she spoke again, her voice was even, but the hurt was tangible, adding to the tension between them. "So we're back to that?" she asked, sinking further into her chair in defeat. "Everything's about the deal again?"</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth, focusing on the wall behind Rio, unable to look her in the eye. "It always has been."</p><p>Rio folded her arms, pressing the folder into her chest as if it could ward off Agatha's coldness. "Right," she said after a beat. "Then I must've misunderstood a few things."</p><p>She wasn't yelling or raising her voice. That made it worse. The measured tone, the <em>restraint</em> - it made the disappointment sharper, more refined.</p><p>"I didn't realize the deal came with hospital care and sharing a bed," she added, gaze fixed somewhere near the corner of the desk. "Maybe you should've had me sign a few addendums."</p><p>Agatha didn't move. Couldn't. Rio's voice acted like a stun gun, freezing her in place.</p><p>"I'm just trying to figure out what changed," Rio continued, quieter now. "Because yesterday you were assuring me I was allowed to be human for five minutes, and now you're treating me like an inconvenience."</p><p>She let out a humorless huff. "Maybe it's the painkillers, maybe I read into things I shouldn't have," her voice dipped again, brushing the edge of something vulnerable before she pulled it back." I just thought... never mind."</p><p>Agatha's throat was right. She wanted to say something, to grab onto that 'never mind' before it vanished, but the words wouldn't come.</p><p>Rio exhaled and shifted forward again, bracing her elbows on her thighs. "Look, if you want me to leave, just say it. I can stay with Alice until I'm better. Give you some space. But I need you to <em>tell me</em>."</p><p>It landed like a blow. Not dramatic or loud, just a clean, precise hit to the chest. The kind you didn't see coming until it knocked the air out of your lungs.</p><p>Then the panic came in, a cold rush climbing up Agatha's spine and spilling across her body in a tidal wave, making her hands tremble. Her heart kicked hard in her chest, her expression schooled with surgical precision. She couldn't let it show - how much the thought of Rio gone gutted her.</p><p>"You can't leave," she said, quiet and sharp like a needle sliding under the skin. "The contract-"</p><p>"Doesn't matter if you keep acting like I'm a nuisance," Rio cut in, voice flat and controlled. "Spending a few nights at Alice's won't undermine the deal."</p><p>Agatha stared past her. The space above Rio's shoulder became everything - the wall, the shadows dancing on the white paint, the occasional grey smudges where she'd moved furniture or Nicky had touched the surface. Anything but her.</p><p>But the tightness in her throat grew sharper. Rio sounded like she was already halfway out the door. Like she was waiting for permission to go. Or maybe mercy.</p><p>Agatha felt it, this horrible split inside her, jagged as glass. She couldn't ask Rio to stay without admitting she wanted her. Not as a contractual placeholder. Not as a fake wife. As <em>hers</em>.</p><p>Unless-</p><p>"You're injured," she noticed coolly. Her fingers tapped once against the closed laptop in front of her. Something to do. Something to hide the shake. "How would it look if I let you sleep on your best friend's couch?"</p><p>She didn't have to look to see Rio's shoulders collapse in on themselves. The sound of her sigh was small but unmistakable, like something giving way.</p><p>"Not everything is about the optics," she murmured. There was no accusation in her tone, only resignation. As if she'd started the conversation hoping it'd mean something and was slowly realizing it didn't.</p><p>Agatha's gaze, traitorous and helpless, drifted toward her. Really looked at her.</p><p>At the exhaustion around her eyes. The way her fingers fidgeted with the edge of the folder, restless and anxious. The tilt in her posture - defensive, wounded, still daring not to run. Not yet.</p><p>It punctured a hole somewhere in Agatha's chest. A miniature wound that started bleeding immediately.</p><p>"It is in our case," she said, and the words felt like lead in her mouth. They tasted like ash. A tired lie wrapped in a lawyer's truth. "You know what we're up against."</p><p>"We're not up against <em>anything</em> right now," Rio said, sharper than before. "No one's watching. This isn't your mother or colleagues. This is just me."</p><p>Rio said it like it wasn't the biggest problem. Like 'just me' meant that Agatha should be comfortable admitting things that should never see the light of day.</p><p>"It's <em>me,</em> too," Agatha replied, clenching her jaw. "I need this to work out. We <em>both</em> do, and the best way to ensure that is to remain professional."</p><p>For a moment, Rio didn't move. She just sat there, still and unreadable. Then she let out a quiet breath, the fight visibly draining from her shoulders.</p><p>"Okay, Agatha," she said softly, tiredly.</p><p>She leaned back in the chair, putting the folder in her lap with careful fingers, smoothing out the edge she'd crumpled without realizing it. When she looked at Agatha again, something had shifted in her eyes. They were still warm and steady but distant. Like a door had gently closed behind them.</p><p>"You're right. We should stick to what this is supposed to be," Rio added, and it was the calmest thing she'd said all day. Which only made it worse.</p><p>Agatha's lungs contracted painfully, her throat tightening, but she said nothing. She couldn't, not without unraveling entirely.</p><p>"I feel fine, so you don't have to stay with me tonight." Rio's voice didn't crack, but it wavered - just once, almost too quietly to catch. "And Alice called me to say she'll pop by with dinner. I figured we could eat together downstairs since you haven't met her properly, but we shouldn't blur any lines."</p><p>She stood slowly, the folder tucked under her arm, no longer looking at Agatha.</p><p>That absence of confrontation - <em>that</em> was what made it land.</p><p>Rio wasn't storming out. She wasn't throwing accusations. She was accepting the rules Agatha kept insisting on. The silence that followed was something louder than any argument.</p><p>She reached the doorway and paused, hand resting on the frame.</p><p>"For what it's worth," she said without turning around, "I liked it better when it wasn't strictly business."</p><p>And before Agatha could form a response, before she could even decide whether she wanted to-</p><p>"I'm back!"</p><p>Nicky's voice shot through the house, followed by the bang of the door and the unmistakable thud of shoes hitting the floor.</p><p>Rio slipped out, leaving the empty doorway in her wake like a visual representation of what Agatha's heart looked like: a gaping hole in her chest.</p><p>She shook her head, rising from her chair and walking into the hall just in time to see the guest bedroom doors click shut. It would've been better if Rio had slammed it. Showed the conversation had left her just as brittle and cold as it had Agatha.</p><p>But she didn't, and Agatha stared at the wooden frame for a moment, wondering if she should knock - make everything better.</p><p>Instead, she inhaled through her nose and let the air out slowly to ease the ache coiling in her chest. Then she squared her shoulders and descended the stairs.</p><p>Nicky had already kicked off his sneakers and stood perched on the last step, backpack slung over one shoulder and shirt half-untucked like he'd raced out of school. He bounced excitedly on the balls of his feet like he was trying to keep from bursting.</p><p>"Can I see Rio now?" he asked, voice pitched high with anticipation like he'd been counting down the minutes to this moment all day.</p><p>Something in Agatha's chest cracked open. At this rate, she was pretty sure her heart resembled scorched earth - fractured and brittle, crisscrossed with the wreckage of long, dry seasons.</p><p>"Hello to you too, my dearest son," she teased lightly because anything more serious might undo her completely. "How about a hug first, huh?"</p><p>Nicky let out an exaggerated huff, a new habit that had appeared a few months back. Once upon a time, he would've flung himself into her arms without hesitation. Now, more and more often, affection came with negotiations. Growing up spared no one, least of all a mother's heart.</p><p>Still, he wrapped his arms around her waist, clinging just long enough to melt the worst of her tension before pulling back. His backpack slid down his arms with a thud.</p><p>"So..." Nicky's eyes flicked to her face, eager. "Can I go?"</p><p>Before Agatha could answer, a voice floated down the stairs, smooth, a little amused, and far too welcome.</p><p>"Hey, buddy."</p><p>She turned automatically, like someone reacting to a bell, and saw Rio at the top of the stairs: one hand braced on the railing, the other stuffed into her pocket. She hadn't come down, either to keep her distance or because she didn't feel up to the challenge. Her bandage had been repositioned and partially obscured by her hair - an effort, Agatha realized, to keep from startling Nicky.</p><p>Her heart swelled - too fast and too much.</p><p>"Rio!" Nicky squealed, already launching into motion, but Agatha stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"Inside voice," she said gently, tapping her temple. "Rio's head still hurts."</p><p>Nicky paused mid-step, nodding sheepishly. "Sorry."</p><p>"It's alright," Agatha murmured, her hand lingering on his back.</p><p>"She looks okay," Nicky said, turning slightly toward her as if seeking reassurance. "Is she really hurt?"</p><p>"She's okay," Agatha confirmed, her voice steady even though her insides weren't. "She just needs rest, so no loud noises, okay?"</p><p>Nicky nodded and then climbed the rest of the stairs, slower this time. Agatha stayed at the base, watching. Rio crouched slightly to meet him halfway, her smile soft and real, and when Nicky asked, "Did it hurt?" she didn't flinch.</p><p>"A little," Rio admitted, crouching further despite her jeopardized sense of balance. "But your mom's been taking really good care of me."</p><p>The words pierced Agatha's chest like daggers, almost making her double over in phantom pain. They weren't untrue - she <em>had</em> been taking care of Rio - but in light of their conversation, they felt like a slap delivered in a subtly mournful voice. Like Rio knew those times wouldn't return.</p><p>Nicky's eyes scanned the bandage, more curious than frightened. "She's good at that," he said, his tone surprisingly serious for someone who'd just bounced into the house like a stray rubber ball. Rio adjusted the strap of his backpack over his shoulder with casual ease, and he leaned into it like he'd known her his whole life. "Was there blood?"</p><p>Agatha caught Rio's eye with a subtle shake of her head. The last thing she needed was Nicky waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, picturing Rio in a pool of blood. One person in the house suffering from that mental image was already too many.</p><p>"A bit," Rio answered lightly, seamlessly navigating the landmine. "But the doctor stitched me up, and between that and your mom's, uh, <em>hovering</em>, I'll be fine in no time."</p><p>"I do not hover," Agatha interjected from the hallway, her voice trailing through the house like a protest she didn't really believe.</p><p>Nicky giggled at the mock offense in her voice. "Mom's overprotective," he said confidently, the way only a child who'd never had to second-guess a parent's love could. "But it's okay. It's 'cause she cares about us."</p><p>The word <em>us</em> landed like a dropped match.</p><p>Agatha's shoulder clipped the doorframe mid-step, drawing a hiss she tried to smother, but the pain barely registered. What did register was the sudden quiet behind her - Rio, still and silent, struck by the unfiltered truth Nicky had thrown into the room like a casual observation.</p><p>
<em>Us.</em>
</p><p>As if there wasn't a line between Rio and the rest of the household - a line Agatha had forcefully redrawn mere minutes ago.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard and kept walking, glad they couldn't see the unnatural stiffness of her spine and the slight tremble in her steps.</p><p>Rio didn't answer.</p><p>But she didn't have to. Nicky said it all.</p><hr/><p>The doorbell rang just as Agatha turned off the stove and reached for the dishtowel. Without the constant hum of the range hood or the hiss of chicken searing in the pan, the house felt too quiet - quiet enough that she could hear the faint sound of Nicky's excited voice carrying down from upstairs. He was recounting his day in breathless bursts, punctuated by Rio's quieter replies - gentle, attentive, careful not to laugh too hard or speak too loudly.</p><p>They hadn't come down since Agatha had shut herself in the kitchen, and she knew that was probably for the best. The last thing she needed right now was to look at Rio and see everything she couldn't have reflected back at her.</p><p>She tossed the dishtowel onto the counter and made her way to the front door, brushing her hands against her jeans before smoothing her sweater down, fingers pausing briefly at her collar to adjust it. A futile instinct, but one she couldn't shake. She wasn't supposed to care what Rio's best friend thought of her. And certainly not enough to fix her hair in the hallway mirror just before opening the door.</p><p>But she did. God help her, she did.</p><p>Because deep down, some part of her wanted Alice to see her and think: <em>I think you'd be good for her.</em></p><p>She opened the door to find Alice already smiling, her easy confidence making it impossible to guess what she'd heard, what she suspected, or how much Rio had told her.</p><p>"Hey," Alice greeted, stepping forward with a tote bag slung over one shoulder and a takeout bag swinging in her left hand. Agatha recognized the logo: it was from Rio's favorite Chinese restaurant near the house, the one she ordered from at least once a week. Usually, something with shrimp, paired with a stack of egg rolls, a few of which always ended up on Agatha's side of the fridge.</p><p>Agatha stepped aside to let her in, keeping her voice calm. "It's good to meet you properly."</p><p>"You too," Alice's gaze swept briefly over her, the kind of glance that sized people up and cataloged intentions. "You look less terrifying than I remember."</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. "It must've been the suit."</p><p>"Probably. I recall mysterious hot woman energy," Alice grinned. "Though the phone call gave 'ice queen with a Harvard law degree.'"</p><p>Agatha couldn't help the short huff of laughter that slipped out. "I'm a woman of many faces."</p><p>"I can see that," Alice replied breezily, toeing off her shoes and scanning the hallway. "Where's the patient?"</p><p>"Upstairs in her room," Agatha replied, and right on cue, soft laughter trickled down the staircase like sunlight through blinds. "She's with my son. I'll call him down for dinner, don't worry."</p><p>Alice scrunched her eyebrows. "Rio said something about eating together?" she lifted the bag, her arm trembling slightly under the weight. "I brought enough for everyone."</p><p>"Oh, that's," Agatha cleared her throat, lips tugging into something that resembled a smile, "that's very kind. But I'm trying to cut down on takeout lately. And I'm sure you'd rather have some time alone with your best friend."</p><p>Alice tilted her head, clearly unconvinced, but didn't argue. "Alright," she said with a shrug, adjusting the strap on her shoulder. "I'll get out of your hair, then."</p><p>"You're welcome to grab anything you need from the kitchen," Agatha said, already halfway turned, trying not to betray how desperately she wanted the conversation to end.</p><p>But Alice's voice stopped her.</p><p>"For all it's worth," she said gently, "Rio doesn't let people take care of her. Not unless she wants to be around them."</p><p>Agatha went still, the words hitting her square in the chest. Simple and dangerous in their honesty.</p><p>Her brain stuttered, snagging on the implications, but Alice didn't linger. She simply offered a half-smile, full of unspoken insight, and turned away.</p><p>"Knock, knock," she called as she climbed the stairs. "I bought gossip and takeout!"</p><p>A beat later, Rio's laughter followed - surprised and bright and painfully unguarded. It peeled something delicate inside Agatha, leaving it open and stinging.</p><p>She didn't bother correcting Alice's volume. Instead, she stood at the foot of the stairs and tilted her head up so her voice, steady and controlled, could travel to the guest bedroom.</p><p>"Dinner's ready, Nicky," she called.</p><p>Predictably, Nicky wasn't thrilled about being called away. "But Ms. Alice just got here! Can't I eat-"</p><p>There was some muffled talking - Rio's voice, she was sure - and then Nicky's exaggerated sigh echoed down the stairs.</p><p>"Okay," he relented.</p><p>Agatha waited until she heard his feet in the hall before retreating into the kitchen, not daring to look back, not trusting herself to hear Rio's voice again, and not unravel.</p><p>Nicky trudged in behind her a minute later, still in his school clothes but without his backpack. Agatha briefly wondered if he'd left it in Rio's room on purpose - one of those conveniently forgetful decisions kids made when they wanted a reason to return somewhere.</p><p>He sighed again, louder this time as if trying to summon sympathy by sheer volume.</p><p>"Ms. Alice said these are for us," he muttered, pushing a takeout box into her hands without much ceremony.</p><p>It was small and rectangular, warm through the paper, and Agatha didn't have to open it to know what it held: four egg rolls stuffed with pork and vegetables and a glossy packet of soy sauce because she'd once told Rio that it was her favorite choice.</p><p>The food wasn't for <em>them</em> - Nicky couldn't care less about egg rolls.</p><p>It was for Agatha. Ordered before she'd reminded Rio - cruelly, carelessly - that their relationship was transactional. Before she'd drawn the line between them in permanent marker and then pretended not to notice how Rio had stopped trying to cross it.</p><p>A small, unnecessary, perfectly considered gesture.</p><p>Agatha's throat tightened like it was closing up. "Thank you," she managed, forcing the words past the lump swelling behind her sternum. With her free hand, she passed Nicky two glasses from the counter. "Bring these to the table, okay? I'll be right there.</p><p>"Whatever."</p><p>The attitude was more pointed than usual, but she didn't have it in her to reprimand him. Her mind was stuck on the weight in her hands, not the actual food, but what it meant. A message in a box: I see you, even when you don't want to be seen.</p><p>When Nicky finally left the room, the silence crashed down around her like a wave.</p><p>Agatha stared at the box for one more second, exhaled sharply, blinked as if to check if the container would still be there, and then chucked it into the trash. The lid slammed shut with a sharp, metallic thud, echoing off the tile and through the bones of the house.</p><p>There was no space for kindness in a contract. No room for soft edges or small acts of care.</p><p>She gripped the edge of the counter, knuckles white as if bracing for the fallout of a choice she'd already made.</p><p>And then, she went to set the table.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha sat motionless in the living room, her eyes fixed on the television, though they didn't register what they saw. The action movie playing was loud and garish - overacted stunts, mismatched explosions, and fire rendered with the kind of CGI that looked like plastic cutouts. Still, she kept watching. Not out of interest but desperation. As if the chaos on screen might make her feel better about the chaos in her life.</p><p>Alice had left over an hour ago, her cheerful demeanor transforming into something more reserved. The smile she gave Agatha was polite, precise, and devoid of the warmth it had held earlier. Only when she turned to Nicky did she seem to soften, offering a fist bump and crinkling a bag of gummy bears that made him grin widely.</p><p>When she'd thanked Agatha for taking care of Rio, her voice was smooth but practiced, like she'd drafted the line upstairs to keep from adding anything more. Not a syllable more than necessary.</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>With her departure, the upstairs fell into a hush. No more bursts of laughter leaking down the stairwell or overlapping voices coloring the silence. Just stillness.</p><p>Agatha had turned on the TV in a moment of reflex, something to drown out the quiet, but it hadn't worked. Not with this kind of silence. This was the kind that pressed in from all sides. The kind that wasn't just the absence of sound but the presence of something unspoken. Or the ghost of everything she'd said.</p><p>She sat rigid on the couch, arms crossed over her chest more for protection than warmth. From what, she wasn't sure. The silence? The echo of Rio's laughter from earlier? The memory of Alice's pointed restraint?</p><p>No. It was the quiet upstairs that hurt the most, the space Rio had occupied, now still and closed off.</p><p>Feeling hurt about it wasn't fair; Agatha knew that. She'd <em>asked</em> for this silence, space, even Alice's restraint. She'd redrawn the line for a <em>reason</em>, and she had no right to describe it as hurtful.</p><p>She glanced at the remote in her lap, considering turning up the volume. But what difference would it make? She could spend the rest of her life in headphones, blaring the loudest music she could find, and it still wouldn't outpace the thoughts spinning circles in her mind.</p><p>No, she had to sit with the silence - <em>get used to it - </em>because there was no alternative.</p><p>The film's credits had started to roll - blocky white letters nobody would read on a black screen - when Agatha finally stood.</p><p>The movement felt reluctant, like her body wasn't entirely hers to control. She turned off the TV, making the forgettable synth score cut mid-note and plunging the room into silence again. It settled around her like an accusation, following her through the house as she moved toward the kitchen.</p><p>She opened one of the cabinets out of Nicky's reach and took out two pill bottles, shaking out a white tablet from each. They pressed into her palm uncomfortably, weighed down by their significance. By what they needed from her.</p><p>Her other hand grabbed a glass of water, the liquid slushing precariously in her trembling grip. It was a simple thing. Something she'd done the night before without a second thought. But now, with everything so brittle between them, it felt like walking into a room with an offering she didn't have the right to give anymore.</p><p>She shook her head at the nonsense.</p><p>A glass of water and painkillers were hardly an offering. They were hardly <em>anything</em>. Definitely not enough to spiral over.</p><p>Still, she climbed the stairs slowly like a sinner walking into a church - hopeful for salvation but aware they don't deserve it.</p><p>At the top, the hallway light was still on, predictably left by Nicky when he'd been getting ready for bed. Her feet stopped outside Rio's door, where the light under the frame was faint but present.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a beat before knocking, her fingers curling tighter around the water glass.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>She didn't overthink the tone - polite but detached, like a clerk inviting in another suppliant - and opened the door.</p><p>Rio looked up from the papers on her lap, not surprised but not entirely welcoming either. She was propped against the headboard, a hoodie pulled over her T-shirt, and a pillow bunched behind her back.</p><p>Agatha spoke before she could think about it. "You're not supposed to strain your eyes."</p><p>"I'm reading the insurance," Rio answered plainly, her tone marking the end of the discussion before it could develop. "I thought you'd send Nicky in again."</p><p>Her eyes slid down to the glass of water, seemingly unable to focus on Agatha's face for longer than necessary.</p><p>"He forgot his backpack here. And I didn't want to impose," Agatha said, hating how defensive she sounded.</p><p>A few hours ago, Rio would've countered the words with a lazy smile and a comment about how Agatha could never impose. Now, she merely nodded.</p><p>Agatha crossed the room and handed over the pills and the glass. Their fingers didn't touch, but they might as well have - something in her chest tightened all the same.</p><p>"Thanks," Rio muttered, swallowing them dry before sipping from the water just to finish the act.</p><p>Agatha stood there like she was waiting for something.</p><p>Permission, maybe. Or a sign she wasn't completely unwanted.</p><p>"As I said," Rio began when she didn't move, "I'm feeling fine, so you don't have to stay with me."</p><p>It shouldn't hurt. Like the silence, she'd brought this on herself. And still, Agatha felt the words sink deep into her chest with dreadful finality.</p><p>She <em>was</em> unwanted.</p><p>And she was the only one to blame.</p><p>"I had Alice Google it," Rio continued, mistaking her heartbroken shock for stubbornness. "My head hurts less between the pills, and I didn't have any dizzy spells, so monitoring isn't necessary."</p><p>For some reason, that stung as well. Maybe because Rio had said it like she was freeing Agatha of a terrible burden. Like the offer stemmed from consideration, not from the coldness swirling between them.</p><p>Agatha nodded dumbly, stealing one last glance at Rio before she turned to leave.</p><p>Halfway to the door, Rio spoke again - soft, almost like an afterthought.</p><p>"Goodnight, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha didn't turn.</p><p>"Goodnight," she replied and shut the door behind her with a quiet click.</p><p>The sting in her chest grew with each step she took toward her bedroom, moving on muscle memory through the dark hallway. It became unbearable when she stepped inside, putting another door between her and Rio - another barrier.</p><p>They needed time. That's what she told herself. Time to recalibrate, to fix the mess between them before it became irreparable. She couldn't name what had started growing between them, not really, but she knew it had roots. And those didn't come up easily.</p><p>She'd expected Rio to push. To brush past the cold dismissal with some half-sincere joke and that insufferable charm that had slowly carved its way under Agatha's skin since the very beginning.</p><p>That's who Rio was. Lighthearted, deflective. The woman who turned every tense moment into something easier to carry, who made being seen feel a little less dangerous. She was supposed to grin and tease and sidestep every emotional landmine Agatha buried between them.</p><p>But tonight, she'd just gone quiet.</p><p>Withdrawn, even.</p><p>And Agatha hadn't been prepared for the way it felt - like all the color had been drained from the room.</p><p>She should be <em>glad</em> how readily Rio had accepted the change: pushback would've made everything more problematic. It would evolve into an exhausting dance of Agatha stepping back while Rio stepped forward, matching her moves. Maybe, eventually, Agatha would've let the matter go and tolerated the weird purgatory she'd existed in until that morning. Nothing would've changed.</p><p>Still, some part - well, if she were honest, <em>all of it</em> - hurt.</p><p>Because Rio had given up.</p><p>For the first time since they'd met, she'd bowed to Agatha's wishes without a prolonged discussion and snarky remarks. Without an actual <em>fight</em>. She just nodded her head and wrapped herself in the new normal like it was a long-forgotten blanket - a bit uncomfortable and scratchy from the dust, but tolerable.</p><p>That stung the most: how quickly Rio had thrown in the towel.</p><p>Agatha stood by the dresser, phone in hand, staring at the screen like it might offer some comfort. Instead, she just set an alarm to wake her in two hours, still plagued by the images of Rio dying of a quiet bleed in her sleep, and locked the screen.</p><p>She'd made the right call. Redrawing the line was necessary for her sanity and the deal's survival, and Rio's reaction only made that more apparent. After all, Rio wasn't invested, not in <em>that</em> way, at least. The money was the draw. The arrangement. The clean payday for twelve months of pretending.</p><p>If Rio had no problem with making their every interaction about the deal again, what good could come out of keeping the lines blurred? What would've been the outcome if Agatha had let those feelings fester other than an embarrassing heartbreak in ten months?</p><p>No, it was better to end the confusion now when the scars on her heart were small enough to fade.</p><p>Maybe if she told herself that enough times, the scars would stop burning.</p><hr/><p>The first alarm was unnecessary.</p><p>Agatha had barely gotten into bed - the mattress pressing cold against her back, the sheets too crisp, too impersonal - when her phone buzzed on the nightstand, slicing through the silence like a scalpel.</p><p>She swung her legs out and stood with a deliberate quiet, padding barefoot across the floor and into the hallway. Her hand paused just before Rio's door.</p><p>Light.</p><p>A thin bar of it stretched beneath the frame, warm against the floorboards like an invitation or a warning. Probably the latter.</p><p>Agatha hovered for a breath, unsure if Rio had fallen asleep with the lights on or found sleep as elusive as she had.</p><p>It didn't matter. Either way, Agatha wouldn't enter. Not until she was sure Rio was out cold and wouldn't say something, anything, that in the hush of the night might make Agatha rethink their entire arrangement.</p><p>So, she backed away like the light itself might burn her, returning to her bedroom with the soft shuffle of retreat, the taste of cowardice bitter in her mouth.</p><p>Two hours later, the second alarm dragged her out of sleep like a rip current. Her dreams dissolved in fragments - blood blooming across her palms, a cold sense of failure soaking into her skin, and Rio watching her, unspeaking, face carved in something close to betrayal.</p><p>She shut the alarm off with trembling fingers.</p><p>This time, the hallway greeted her with a deeper, uninterrupted darkness. The light was gone.</p><p>The door, freshly oiled thanks to Rio's complaint that "the hinges sound like Dracula's castle gate when they move," opened silently beneath Agatha's hand.</p><p>The room was hushed but not silent. The rhythmic sound of Rio's breathing filled the space, steady and unbroken. She lay curled on her side, one hand buried beneath the pillow, the other stretched across the mattress in a painfully familiar gesture.</p><p>Agatha stood there for a beat, watching the steady movement of Rio's chest - the same pattern she'd felt under her palm last night. She could still sense it in her fingertips like a current, pulsing and alive, setting her skin aflame. A mere memory now, a reminder of what she couldn't have.</p><p>And shouldn't want.</p><p>A car passed outside, its headlights slipping through the blinds and illuminating the bed in a burst of light, catching on the relaxed line of Rio's shoulders and the slight pout of her lips. They parted as if to say something, an unfinished proclamation hanging off them like forbidden fruit before Rio stirred, the hand on the covers flexing against the material.</p><p>Agatha stepped out of the room in one fluid step, clicking the door shut behind her.</p><p>The third alarm caught her off guard, making her sit on the bed with a gasp as she tried to get her bearings. Too bleary for worry or hesitation, she kicked the covers back and padded to Rio's bedroom on autopilot, still blinking the sleep away when she pushed the door open.</p><p>Only half aware of her surroundings, Agatha paused to listen for the soft sound of Rio's breathing, tired eyes scanning the darkness to find the familiar movement beneath the covers.</p><p>Then, a voice cut through the quiet like a knife, "I told you 'm fine."</p><p>Agatha froze, pulse stuttering, cheeks flaring with heat as Rio's eyes cracked open, dark and sharp, and far too focused for someone barely awake.</p><p>"I- sorry," she whispered, backing away so fast she nearly stumbled over her own feet. Her throat burned with humiliation, and her skin buzzed with the weight of being seen. Being <em>caught.</em></p><p>Somewhere in the back of her mind, she tried to rationalize it: the doctor had said forty-eight hours, day and night. She was only following his orders. Checking on Rio didn't have to mean anything more than that.</p><p>But it did. As much as Agatha didn't want it to, it did.</p><p>She made to turn again, to disappear into the shadows like she hadn't come in at all, when Rio's voice scraped at the walls of her chest.</p><p>"Just stay."</p><p>Groggy. Soft. <em>Real.</em></p><p>Agatha stopped cold.</p><p>She'd heard those words before. Echoed in the small hours, muttered unconsciously among deep breaths. But this wasn't that. This wasn't a dream or a phantom wish. This was Rio - awake, <em>aware</em> - offering something that shouldn't still be on the table.</p><p>Agatha stood there, blinking into the dark, unsure which part of her cracked first: the one that had drawn the line or the one that had never wanted it drawn at all.</p><p>"I shouldn't," she eventually whispered, her voice heavier than she intended. Almost reluctant, like turning the offer down caused her discomfort.</p><p>Rio shifted under the covers, withdrawing the hand slung across the mattress and turning onto her back. "Either that or stop creating a draft every two hours," she muttered, eyes trained on Agatha as if the darkness couldn't stop her from seeing every detail and noticing how fragile Agatha's resolve was.</p><p>Then, her expression softened, crumpling at the edges like the effort of keeping her emotions at bay was too much for her tired muscles.</p><p>"I want you to."</p><p>It squeezed the air out of Agatha's lungs.</p><p>She didn't know which was worse: the words themselves or the gentle, coaxing tone. Maybe it was both, creating a mixture so deadly, so irresistible, that she didn't fully realize she was moving until her knees hit the bed.</p><p>Nothing good could come out of this. Slipping under the covers would be like slapping a band-aid over a gunshot wound - it wouldn't stop the bleeding, only remedying the problem for a brief moment. It wouldn't help Agatha's bed feel warmer or less lonely in the future.</p><p>It wouldn't make their situation any better.</p><p>But all that didn't really matter. Not in that moment. Not when Rio kept looking at her with a gentleness that Agatha didn't think she'd ever see again. Not when she was saying words that didn't have a place in their renegotiated deal but still felt right.</p><p>"We'll go back tomorrow," Rio added, barely above a whisper.</p><p>Back to detachment and coldness. Back to acquaintances pretending to be in love.</p><p>Agatha gripped the covers, lifting them slowly as if waiting for Rio to change her mind. When she didn't, Agatha nodded, slipping into the bed like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>The warmth was immediate, seeping into her muscles and uncoiling the knots of worry in her stomach. She lay on her back, closer to Rio than before, but not touching, not crossing the line any further than she already had.</p><p>"Tomorrow," she confirmed, sinking into the pillows and letting Rio's perfume envelop her.</p><p>Then, Rio moved, a hand brushing against Agatha's until their fingers interlocked on the covers in silence. It should have served as a warning sign, a reminder of how the momentary weakness could only end in catastrophe.</p><p>But Agatha didn't care, too tired to fight the pull or maybe too selfish to let go of that last moment of comfort.</p><p>She fell asleep holding onto something that wasn't hers, and the next morning, she wordlessly untangled herself from Rio's hold, fleeing the room just as the sun began to creep in through the blinds, making the moment feel too real.</p><p>They didn't speak of it when she brought Rio breakfast.</p><p>There was no banter or further protests when Rio handed her the signed insurance contract.</p><p>Agatha's call with Maria was short and ended with the older woman saying she wouldn't bother her again, deaf to Agatha's insistence that it was no trouble.</p><p>As promised, they were back to square one.</p><hr/><p>It took her over a week to realize it wasn't <em>square one</em>. Phrasing it like that would mean returning to something previously known, perhaps uncomfortable but familiar. A well-worn discomfort, the kind you could brace for.</p><p>But whatever stood between them now wasn't familiar. It was foreign and strained. A silence wound too tight to be called peace, too polite to be called war.</p><p>At first, Agatha told herself it was circumstantial. The tension, the brittle exchanges, and even the way they orbited each other like wary satellites could be blamed on confinement. Rio was recovering, grounded by her injury. Agatha was tethered to the house by obligation, by Lilia's misguided conviction that caring for Rio was her responsibility.</p><p>There was no space to breathe, not really. Agatha's quick grocery runs and Nicky's school drop-offs weren't long enough to shake off the heaviness that clung to the walls. Their daily rhythm - once predictable and fluid - now stuttered like a song skipping on a scratched record. And Agatha, foolishly or hopefully, believed it would pass. Things would realign once Rio was back on her feet and back at work and school.</p><p>But then the stitches came out. The doctor cleared her. Life was supposed to resume.</p><p>It didn't.</p><p>If anything, the distance widened.</p><p>The first noticeable change was in the kitchen. Well, the entire house, really. The silence didn't just exist between them - it settled into the walls, the corners, the spaces Rio used to fill without trying.</p><p>Once, the kitchen had been her domain. She'd glide through it with a kind of chaotic grace, narrating her experiments with too much chili paste or asking Nicky if he could taste the secret ingredient in the sauce. Music was always playing - soft jazz in the morning, synth-pop while she prepped dinner, and early 2000s hits when she needed to clean. Her portable speaker had practically lived on the kitchen island, humming with whatever matched her mood that day.</p><p>Now, it was gone. Packed away or buried in a drawer, Agatha didn't know.</p><p>In its place was stillness. Suffocating and irreversible.</p><p>Rio had switched to headphones, invisible ones, ones that made her harder to reach. Her cooking - once a shared ritual, something warm and unspoken between all three of them - had stopped entirely. She still made herself meals, but Agatha rarely saw it. The only assurance that Rio still ate was the lingering smell of spices that clung to the air like an unspoken accusation when Agatha entered the house after work.</p><p>The speaker and the laughter were gone. The meals were prepared separately, cooked by two different sets of hands, and served in two different rooms.</p><p>And Agatha hadn't realized how much Rio had given, day by day, until she'd taken it all back.</p><p>The garden came next.</p><p>The flower beds in the yard - once a testament to Rio and Nicky's shared enthusiasm - continued to thrive. The tomatoes and peppers got taller by the minute, and the basil became green and fragrant. The soil was rich with growth, but the energy behind it had dulled. Rio still watered the rows, knelt beside Nicky to answer his endless questions, and smiled when he tugged at her sleeve to show her something new.</p><p>But something was gone.</p><p>She no longer added new plants. When Nicky suggested expanding the garden like they'd once planned, Rio offered a flat excuse - too late in the season, she said. Nothing else would take.</p><p>She was still present but distantly. Tending to the garden like she was finishing something, not building toward anything new.</p><p>And Agatha could feel it in her bones - Rio had finally seen the garden as something she wouldn't get to watch bloom. She'd understood she was pouring her energy into something that wouldn't last.</p><p>Then, there were movie nights with Rio's added presence. It was a strategic ritual that aligned perfectly with Agatha's growing need to distract Nicky from the subtle, steady shift in the house's atmosphere.</p><p>Once a week, she and Rio sat on the couch, always with Nicky in the middle. The placement felt deliberate, a buffer disguised as a boy. They took turns picking the movies and usually landed on something loud and action-packed, the kind that gave no room for conversation or wandering thoughts. They watched with eyes trained on the screen like it could hypnotize them into forgetting how far apart they'd drifted.</p><p>They laughed when Nicky laughed. They reacted when he reacted. They answered his questions and nodded along to his comments. But it was performative. Between the boisterous sound effects and choreographed action scenes, a different kind of silence lingered. Not the peaceful kind that once made Agatha feel safe, but a silence that felt like walking a tightrope over something neither of them could afford to fall into.</p><p>What had started as an attempt at normalcy became a ritual of avoidance.</p><p>It was easy to pretend things weren't as bad as they truly were when they could spend two hours in a room together.</p><p>And though Nicky didn't say anything, Agatha saw the way he looked between them when the credits rolled - like he was waiting for a joke or a comment or even a shared glance. Something. <em>Anything</em>.</p><p>But the screen would fade to black, the lights would go on, and the night would end in quiet goodnights and averted eyes.</p><p>Because even during movie night, Rio never reached for the remote first. Never asked if they wanted popcorn. Never stayed on the couch a minute longer than necessary.</p><p>For the first time since they'd met, she was acting exactly how Agatha wanted her to: like a stranger.</p><hr/><p>"Got a minute?"</p><p>Agatha didn't bother masking the groan that rumbled low in her throat, a sound of pure exasperation as her gaze lifted from her laptop and landed on the door. The day had been suspiciously peaceful - no unannounced calls, no client meltdowns, not even a misplaced file. Billy had been giving her an impressively wide berth for days. She should have known the silence was borrowed time.</p><p>"No," she said flatly, knowing full well it wouldn't make a difference. It never did with Lilia.</p><p>Unbothered, Lilia strolled into the office like she owned the floor, which she did, in some abstract, terrifying way. She carried two paper coffee cups, and when she reached the desk, she held one out expectantly. Agatha glanced at the label, recognizing it as her favorite cafe two blocks over.</p><p>She didn't take the offering. Lilia placed it on the desk anyway and eased into the leather chair across from her with the grace of someone who had steamrolled CEOs and judges alike.</p><p>"Bribes won't get you anywhere," Agatha said coolly.</p><p>"It's not a bribe. It's an incentive," Lilia corrected, waving her free hand in a lazy arc, the colorful bangles around her wrist singing their usual tune. "This'll only take a minute."</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms over her chest. "I don't have a minute. Bradford's team managed to screw up something even a first-year would've flagged, and now I have to fix it before it blows back on us."</p><p>"Mm," Lilia hummed noncommitally, taking a sip from her cup. "This isn't about work."</p><p>"I don't have time to socialize, either."</p><p>Lilia smiled faintly. "You're impossible. But I admire the commitment."</p><p>When Agatha didn't respond, Lilia settled more comfortably into her chair. "So. How's your little scheme going?"</p><p>Agatha stiffened.</p><p>The question was a landmine, and they both knew it. But she wouldn't be Agatha Harkness if she gave Lilia the satisfaction of watching her flinch.</p><p>"You'll have to narrow it down. I run several."</p><p>Lilia raised one arched brow. "The one with the fake marriage and the woman who looks at you like you personally assassinated joy."</p><p>"Oh, so you've staged an intervention," Agatha let out a humorless chuckle. "Should've brought Jen. She'll feel left out."</p><p>"Jen tends to poke holes in things that don't need more damage," Lilia said calmly. "Besides, this one's mine."</p><p>Agatha's jaw clenched. "Let me guess. Alice tattled."</p><p>"She didn't have to," Lilia replied with a shrug. "I saw Rio on Sunday. We were finalizing details for Alice's birthday. I asked if you were coming, and she said - and I quote - 'I don't see a scenario where Agatha would want to be there.'"</p><p>Agatha looked down at her laptop, jaw tight, eyes fixed on the blinking cursor. She refused to let the words land. Refused to let them sting.</p><p>"Which brings me to why I'm here," Lilia went on, her voice growing pointed. "You're coming."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Agatha barked out a disbelieving laugh. "Absolutely not. I'm not crashing a party I wasn't invited to."</p><p>"<em>I'm</em> inviting you."</p><p>"That doesn't count."</p><p>"It counts where it matters," Lilia replied, tapping her fingernails against the cup in a steady rhythm. "The gala was a month ago, give or take. How many times have you gone out since then?"</p><p>Zero. The idea of dates had died along with their ability to coexist in the same room without feeling uncomfortable, and Agatha let it. Her mother hadn't contacted her since the dinner. There were no eyes on them. She figured they deserved a moment of peace - a moment to pull themselves together.</p><p>And when the moment stretched into weeks, and the silence between them still felt too delicate to touch, Agatha tabled the topic for later.</p><p>Much later. Possibly never.</p><p>Lilia took her silence for an answer. "That's what I thought. You can treat this as a trial run."</p><p>"We've been planning to go to one of Nicky's games," Agatha countered, the remark brittle on her tongue. They hadn't planned shit. On the contrary, she'd been dodging Nicky's questions about it like a professional rugby player dodged getting tackled. "Soccer moms are better gossipers than whoever's going to be at the party. The news would travel faster."</p><p>"What about you not going to your wife's best friend's birthday party?" Lilia asked, raising her brows. "How fast do you think that'd reach your mother?"</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together. "I could make an excuse."</p><p>"Or you could just get your head out of your ass and come," Lilia rose from her chair, chucking the empty cup into the trash. "You're smart, Agatha. Don't let your stubbornness keep you from getting what you want."</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p><p>Lilia ignored the question, one foot already outside the office. "Rio'll give you the details of the party," she threw over her shoulder. "Wear the green dress. It makes you look less likely to kill someone."</p><p>Agatha watched the door click shut with her face frozen somewhere between anger and confusion.</p><hr/><p>Eventually, she had to admit Lilia was, to <em>some </em>extent, right.</p><p>Skipping Alice's birthday party would hand Evanora too much ammunition. Even if Agatha crafted a credible excuse - something about an urgent client meeting or Nicky coming down with a fever - it would leave a conspicuous gap in the illusion she'd worked so hard to maintain. There were no recent public outings to point to, no new photos, no thinly veiled anecdotes for the gossip mill.</p><p>And Agatha knew her mother too well to believe for a second that she wasn't being watched.</p><p>Maybe not directly - though she wouldn't put it past Evanora to plant a PI in the bushes - but there were whispers. Loyal ears. Eyes at every corner of the city. Every detail filtered back to her eventually, and Agatha could already imagine the condescending tone she'd use: <em>If you wanted to fake a marriage, dear, you could've at least committed to the performance.</em></p><p>Alice's party, in comparison, seemed harmless. Public enough to make a statement, casual enough to avoid scrutiny. More importantly, it offered a way to reset the narrative without forcing her and Rio into a painful one-on-one.</p><p>But wanting to attend wasn't the same as having the right to.</p><p>The party would mean stepping into Rio's space - space she'd withdrawn into so completely that it now felt like foreign territory. It didn't matter that Agatha had paid for the house, furnished it, or built the life inside it. In the emotional landscape they occupied, Rio had redrawn the borders. And Agatha wasn't sure she still had the visa.</p><p>So after dinner, she left Nicky bent over his English homework at the table, careful not to interrupt him, and climbed the stairs with slow, measured steps. Her intent wavered with each one. A part of her hoped to cross Rio in the hallway or the kitchen, anywhere that didn't feel like enemy territory. But Rio had a knack for vanishing lately, appearing only for necessities: food, sunlight, and Nicky.</p><p>Agatha reached the guest room door before she could talk herself out of it.</p><p>She hadn't been up here since she'd stopped bringing Rio meals and medication - back when silence felt like a side effect of recovery, not a punishment. The air felt heavier now, the kind of quiet that settled into the walls and furniture like dust.</p><p>Before she could change her mind, she knocked - three short taps - and stood frozen in place, heart thudding against her ribs like it wanted out.</p><p>Agatha couldn't blame it; <em>she</em> wanted out as well.</p><p>Instead of the familiar <em>come in</em>, she heard shuffling in the room - papers set aside, books thudding closed - before the door opened, unveiling Rio in a simple black T-shirt with the bar's logo and ripped jeans.</p><p>That was another change: they no longer coordinated their days. Or rather, they didn't talk about their plans.</p><p>Well, they didn't talk much at all.</p><p>"You're heading to work?" Agatha asked before she could stop herself, mentally flipping through the pieces of Rio's routine she'd managed to gather purely from observation.</p><p>Everything pointed to Rio staying home for the night.</p><p>"Yeah, I can't work Saturday," Rio replied without offering further explanation. "Everything alright?"</p><p>Not <em>Why are you here?</em></p><p>Not even <em>Did you need something?</em></p><p>No, Rio's first instinct, despite the distance Agatha had put between them, was to ask if everything was alright.</p><p>Agatha shook off the weird feeling it sparked in her chest. "Yes, but I wanted to talk. Do you have a minute?"</p><p>A shadow passed Rio's face, something unreadable in her eyes, and Agatha braced for rejection, but the woman merely nodded, leaning her shoulder against the doorframe. A clear sign that Agatha was no longer welcome in her space.</p><p>"It's about Saturday, actually," Agatha said slowly, her thumb spinning the wedding band around her ring finger. The nervous tick was a new development, and she didn't want to think about the symbolism. About why the gesture grounded her. "Lilia told me about Alice's birthday party."</p><p>Rio's expression remained stoic, but her lips trembled slightly when she opened them to speak. "It starts around 7, so if you need me to look after Nicky or something-"</p><p>"No, no, no," Agatha shook her head. The exchange was almost painful, and not for the first time, she missed the ease with which this used to come to them.</p><p>Then she remembered she didn't have the right to miss something that she'd taken from them.</p><p>"I was wondering if-" she swallowed thickly around the lump in her throat, "-if you wouldn't mind if I came?"</p><p>Surprise flickered in Rio's eyes, her brows rising to her hairline as if pulled by invisible strings. "You want to come to Alice's birthday party?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>The suspicious notes were hard to miss, and Agatha flinched. Of course, Rio wouldn't think she wanted to come for Alice or even her. There had to be a hidden meaning in the query.</p><p>And it stung because it was <em>true.</em></p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly, already regretting her next words but unable to lie. Not that Rio would believe her, anyway. "It would look good," she said in a small voice, looking away from Rio's face, but not before she saw it crumble at the edges.</p><p>"Right," Rio said. "You want to use my best friend's birthday party for optics."</p><p>The steel behind the words was enough for Agatha's defenses to rise. "It was Lilia's idea. She invited me."</p><p>Rio shook her head, letting out a humorless chuckle. "Well, what do you need from me, then? My blessing isn't necessary."</p><p>It wasn't an attack, not really. Rio spoke quietly and without traces of anger in her voice. More disbelieving than scorned.</p><p>Agatha figured she'd rather get yelled at.</p><p>"Listen," she said, running a hand through her hair, "I know it's not ideal. I know I'm probably the last person you want there. But it would look suspicious if I didn't at least show up."</p><p>The silence stretched between them, and Agatha chanced a look at Rio, expecting to see barely contained anger twisting her features into something unrecognizable.</p><p>Instead, she found weariness.</p><p>Rio didn't respond right away. She exhaled through her nose, slow and quiet as if weighing the request like a contract clause. Then she gave a small nod and pushed off the doorframe, arms crossed loosely over her chest.</p><p>"Alright," she said. "We'll go together, then."</p><p>Agatha blinked. "Really?"</p><p>"It makes more sense," Rio continued, her voice steady but neutral. "Pulling up separately wouldn't paint the right picture."</p><p>She wasn't looking at Agatha. Her gaze was fixed on the wall like she was making mental notes. Her tone didn't carry any warmth or resentment, just clinical calm.</p><p>"How do you want to play it once we're there?" Rio asked, eyes flicking back to her, but unreadable. "Not everyone will know about the arrangement, so we'll have to act married. Hand-holding? Matching smiles? Do I loop my arm through yours while we talk to someone?"</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a moment. Rio was already moving ahead, treating this like just another task, another part of the deal they'd both signed on for. And maybe that was easier. Cleaner.</p><p>"I think... just enough," Agatha said after a pause. "Stand close, maybe a few touches here and there."</p><p>"Sounds good."</p><p>The silence returned, stretching long and uncomfortable. Agatha could feel it crawling up her spine, like vines wrapping around her ribs.</p><p>"Rio, I-" she hesitated, too many words hanging off her lips, too many thoughts swirling in her head. "We don't have to do it. I can make up an excuse, and we'll work out a different outing. Something that doesn't invade your space."</p><p>Rio's expression softened - just a fraction - but it was enough to make Agatha's chest tighten. In the smooth lines on Rio's face, she saw the reminder of how things used to be: unguarded and warm.</p><p>"You already asked," Rio said gently, studying Agatha like she was trying to figure out what she really meant beneath all the careful language. "And I already agreed."</p><p>"I know," Agatha muttered. "But you deserve some time away from... all this," she vaguely gestured with her hand, unsure if she was pointing to herself, the space between them, or the house. The words applied to all three.</p><p>Rio unfolded her arms with a sigh. "I think we both do," she noticed, chewing on her bottom lip. "It'll be different than the gala, fewer scrutinizing eyes or posh lawyers waiting to report back to Evanora."</p><p>Agatha scrunched her eyebrows, not sure where Rio's train of thought was heading. "Yeah, I figured as much. Alice doesn't seem the type to be friends with the kind of people my mother surrounds herself with."</p><p>"So," Rio hesitated, searching for the right words, "as long as we act normal, like before, we should be fine."</p><p>Right, there was a <em>before</em> now. An elusive, imprecise term for describing the times the air in the room didn't feel suffocating whenever they were together.</p><p>"All I'm saying is," Rio continued, "we don't have to treat it as this grand mission of convincing everyone. We can just go to the party and have fun. Together."</p><p>It almost gave Agatha whiplash. A minute ago, Rio was talking about logistics - detached and practical in her calculations about what would look best. Now, she was waving a white flag, asking Agatha to put everything between them aside and simply enjoy Alice's birthday.</p><p>Agatha figured it made sense: the last thing Rio probably wanted was to have to spend her best friend's birthday focusing on selling a lie. It was her time to unwind, to forget about the deal and the issues it had brought into her life.</p><p>And after inserting herself into the party, Agatha owed her that much.</p><p>"Yeah, we can do that," she said with a nod, ignoring the nagging voice at the back of her mind asking <em>Can you?</em></p><p>The question lingered, heavier than she liked to admit, but Agatha pushed it down. It wasn't the time to dissect her holdups, to dwell on how convincing she and Rio could be after spending the past few weeks on avoidance and silence.</p><p>Rio didn't say anything right away, but her shoulders seemed to loosen just a bit, the stiff lines of tension softening at the edges. It wasn't approval, not quite trust, but maybe acceptance - a silent agreement to try.</p><p>Agatha watched her for a moment longer, unsure if she should say something more, offer a joke, or a gentle nudge to lighten the air between them. But the moment didn't ask for that. It asked for quiet, a ceasefire.</p><p>"I'll be ready by six," Rio finally said, turning to retreat into her room.</p><p>Agatha nodded, even though Rio couldn't see her. "Okay."</p><p>And then the door clicked shut.</p><p>Left in the hallway, Agatha stayed still for a beat longer, listening to the muted quiet behind the door.</p><p>All she could focus on was that the conversation had been the longest she'd had with Rio in weeks.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>On Saturday, Agatha pulled up to Wanda's house, the car rolling to a gentle stop as Nicky practically vibrated in the backseat, his excitement palpable. He'd been counting down the hours to his overnight stay with the twins, face pressed to the window the moment their porch came into view.</p><p>Agatha had braced herself for a different kind of energy. The sulking kind that concentrated on not being invited to the party. Lately, Nicky had become increasingly vocal about wanting more time with her and Rio. The movie nights had never been enough, but now it became apparent. He asked when they'd do things <em>together</em>, not just with him in the middle acting as a buffer. And Agatha had started running out of easy answers.</p><p>She knew it was only a matter of time before she'd have to bring Rio along to one of his games, especially with the end of the season looming like a clock ticking down. She'd heard him asking Rio if she would be there for the last one. She'd also heard Rio's vague non-answer about work and classes.</p><p>So when she'd broken the news about Alice's birthday - carefully emphasizing that it was an adults-only event - she'd been prepared for an argument, complete with counter-offers. The same she'd gotten months ago when she'd explained why he couldn't come to the bar with her and Wanda for <em>her</em> birthday.</p><p>But the protest never came.</p><p>As soon as she'd mentioned she and Rio would be going together, Nicky's face lit up like she'd just handed him the moon. His only condition was clear and simple: he wanted to stay at Wanda's, not with Sharon, which she had thought fair. When she'd agreed, he'd dashed off to pack his overnight bag with a kind of unfiltered joy that stung in a place Agatha hadn't realized was still sore.</p><p>Because for all the effort she'd put into managing this arrangement - this fragile illusion of stability - it was moments like that that reminded her just how closely Nicky was watching. How deeply he wanted to believe they were a family.</p><p>She glanced at him now through the rearview mirror as he fidgeted with his seatbelt, humming to himself, a slight smile playing on his lips. There was no pout. No bitterness. Just quiet satisfaction.</p><p>It felt like a small victory. And somehow, it still hurt.</p><p>Before she could dwell on it too long, the front door swung open, and two figures stepped out.</p><p>"Right on time," Wanda called out with a grin, tugging her cardigan tighter around her.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the stereotypical suburban mom's look. All Wanda needed was a Southern accent and a divorce, and she could star in a shitty TV show.</p><p>"Nicky!" Tommy roared, his mop of hair jumping from his ecstatic bouncing. "We're in the middle of a game! C'mon!"</p><p>Nicky didn't wait for Agatha to unbuckle her seatbelt. He scrambled out of the car with the kind of speed only sugar-fueled anticipation could summon, throwing Wanda a quick <em>hi</em> before disappearing into the house with Tommy.</p><p>Agatha followed slowly, slinging his overnight bag over her shoulder with a sigh. If only she could muster up that kind of energy, the party would be a piece of cake.</p><p>"Don't look too excited," Wanda laughed once she climbed up to the porch, eyeing Agatha with a knowing look. "You sure you're going to a birthday party and not a funeral?"</p><p>"It can always turn into a funeral," Agatha bit back, pushing the bag into her friend's arms.</p><p>"Yours or Rio's?"</p><p>"Lilia's."</p><p>Wanda giggled, shaking her head. "I aspire to be like her when I'm older. I mean, that kind of meddling? Impeccable."</p><p>"She's Sicilian. She loves drama," Agatha said, glancing over Wanda's shoulder and into the house. Nicky was long gone, his gleeful shouts mixing with the twins' as they played in the backyard. "I'll pick him up in the morning."</p><p>"I'll have coffee ready," Wanda smirked, hauling the bag onto her shoulder. "The debrief will be amazing. I can feel it."</p><p>Agatha didn't share her friend's enthusiasm. "There won't be anything to talk about if I can help it," she grumbled. "Rio doesn't even <em>want</em> me to go. The least I can do is sit in a corner and let her enjoy the party without being reminded of my presence."</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. "Okay, A - I doubt she'd ever say that. And B - you're supposed to have fun. Not sulk in the corner."</p><p>"Nobody said anything about sulking," Agatha argued, crossing her arms and jutting out her chin. "And the fun thing was to make me feel better about crashing the party. We're going for optics."</p><p>"Right," Wanda said, drawing out the word to ensure the sarcasm was unmistakable. "Does Rio strike you as the kind of person to take someone to a party even if she doesn't want to?" Agatha didn't have the time to answer. "Yeah, me neither. You're going because she wants you to."</p><p>"I'm going because it's her best friend's birthday, and it'd look fucking weird if I didn't," Agatha hissed. "She doesn't talk to me anymore. She makes clear efforts to avoid me around the house. I doubt Alice's party is a place she wants to see me."</p><p>The warning in her voice did little to stop Wanda. "Well, that's what you wanted, right? For her to give you space?"</p><p>It was. That day in her office, she'd looked at Rio and knew they couldn't keep going the way they were. Her problem was that she hadn't done it sooner - before the thing growing in her chest could take root.</p><p>Now, the distance hurt more than the closeness.</p><p>"Exactly," she agreed. "And now I'm invading <em>her</em> space. It's unfair."</p><p>Wanda looked at her, long and scrutinizing. "It's not invading if she invited you," she noticed gently.</p><p>Something in Agatha's gut twisted painfully, but she didn't dwell on it. "Whatever. I have to go, or we'll be late. See you tomorrow."</p><p>When she turned to leave, she could hear Wanda mumble something that sounded suspiciously like <em>stubborn fucking idiot</em> under her breath.</p><hr/><p>As it turned out, Agatha had plenty of time to spare. Too much.</p><p>She'd accounted for Wanda talking her ear off at the drop-off, which probably would've happened if not for her abrupt exit. Now she stood in her bedroom, already dressed and ready to go, a full thirty minutes before the set time.</p><p>Which, for someone who usually treated arrival times as loose suggestions rather than sacred deadlines, was a fucking miracle.</p><p>She glanced at herself in the mirror for the millionth time - makeup set, earrings on, the dress she'd debated three times hanging just right - and fiddled with her wedding band. Everything was in place: no smudges, no stray hairs, no excuse to stall.</p><p>And still, she felt overwhelmingly unprepared. Nervous, even.</p><p>It wasn't the kind of thought she'd ever speak aloud - God forbid - but it hovered there, heavy and insistent, gnawing at her composure like water against stone. Even admitting it to herself came with a quiet sting of shame.</p><p>Agatha Harkness: a woman who could disarm a hostile witness in under five minutes, who'd climbed the corporate ladder in heels and with a kid on her hip, now finding her hands clammy at the idea of a birthday party.</p><p>A birthday party where most of the guests would be in their late twenties, probably more focused on cocktails and dancing than on her and Rio.</p><p>It was ridiculous. Utterly absurd. And yet, here Agatha was - staring herself down like her reflection might break free from the mirror and attend the celebration for her.</p><p>She tried to convince herself it was the unfamiliar terrain - the crowd of twenty-somethings, their quick jokes and shared references she'd have to smile through like an outsider at a family reunion. The music would be loud, the drinks sweet, the conversations fast and fleeting. It should've been enough to make her uneasy.</p><p>But she'd navigated client brunches with passive-aggressive men who thought owning a collection of expensive watches made them infallible. She'd survived galas where every laugh had an agenda and garden parties where every compliment came with a price tag. She was a master at blending in, at adjusting her personality until a deal was closed or the courtroom was charmed.</p><p>But she didn't want to do that at the party.</p><p>She didn't want to put on the persona she'd curated for work events, molded to inspire respect and sometimes fear. She wanted to be, well, <em>liked</em>. Or at least tolerated. She wanted Rio's circle to think, <em>Oh, she's not so bad. </em>Maybe even <em>I get it.</em></p><p>Which was ridiculous. Agatha was a grown woman, not some teenager meeting the popular crowd for the first time. Besides, the crowd didn't even really <em>matter.</em> Her relationship with Rio wasn't real. Her friends' opinions on it, on <em>Agatha,</em> would be based on pretenses.</p><p>But the thought of being the awkward plus-one with stiff smiles and forced charm made her stomach twist.</p><p>She didn't want to be the person Rio had to explain, even if it wasn't real.</p><p>The soft knock on the door startled her out of her thoughts. She glanced at her watch and realized that the spiraling, although ultimately pointless, had at least helped her burn through the remaining time.</p><p>"Hey, you ready?" Rio asked from the other side, and Agatha looked at her reflection again as if to make sure they couldn't swap places.</p><p>All she found was a pair of wide blue eyes staring back at her, resembling a trapped animal searching for a way out of a snare. Great.</p><p>"Yeah," she croaked back, grabbing her purse and Alice's gift with shaky hands.</p><p>Jesus, she needed to get a grip. It was just a stupid party with people she didn't care about. She'd be <em>fine</em>.</p><p>Planting that thought firmly at the front of her mind, she opened the door.</p><p>Rio stood just outside, dressed simply but cleanly, the kind of effortless cool that made Agatha feel more overdressed than she already suspected she was. She wore a deep charcoal blazer over a dark moss-green top - just enough of a color match to Agatha's dress to register but not enough to feel coordinated. Her black slacks were tailored, her boots clean, and her hair framed her face in wavy lines, somehow accentuating her cheekbones.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, had taken Lilia's advice on what she should wear. The dark green of her dress hit just below the knee, fitted at the waist, and sharp at the shoulders, a structured elegance she couldn't help but default to.</p><p>Rio's eyes did a quick sweep over her, pausing just long enough that Agatha felt her pulse jump.</p><p>"Wow," Rio said, and it wasn't with awe or irony - it was quiet, genuine. "I've never seen you in green. You look... really nice. It suits you."</p><p>Agatha blinked, thrown for half a second. "Lilia said it'd make me look less likely to kill someone," she explained, managing to keep her voice even. "You look really nice, too."</p><p>To her surprise, Rio chuckled. "Jesus, that woman is impossible," she pointed to her top with an amused shake of her head. "Lilia bought me this. Said if I showed up in another band tee, she'd burn my closet and give me a lecture on fashion."</p><p>Agatha snorted. "Sounds like Lilia."</p><p>Rio grinned, tilting her head. "You don't think it's too much? I mean - matching?"</p><p>Agatha let her eyes trail briefly over the hint of green on Rio. It was subtle against the darker tones, and if Agatha was being honest, she liked the idea of them matching. It made them seem like... something. "Not really. Unless we start speaking in unison, I think we're safe."</p><p>"Damn. I was working on a synchronized entrance."</p><p>"Please don't."</p><p>Their smiles lingered just a little too long before Rio took a step back. "C'mon. Let's get this show on the road."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but followed, her heart a little lighter than it had been ten minutes ago.</p><p>They descended the stairs silently, unhurriedly, despite already being behind schedule. When Agatha reached for the garage door, fiddling with her car keys, Rio's voice stopped her.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Agatha furrowed her brows. "Driving?"</p><p>"To a birthday party?" Rio plucked out her phone from her pocket. "There's no way either one of us is staying sober enough to drive back. I'll get an Uber."</p><p>"No, it's fine," Agatha pulled the door open, motioning for the woman to step inside. "I'm not drinking."</p><p>Rio's fingers froze mid-tap, her head snapping up to look at Agatha. The shock was almost amusing. "You're not drinking?"</p><p>"I have to pick up Nicky tomorrow morning," Agatha shrugged. "And DD-ing is the best excuse to avoid people nagging me about shots or whatever."</p><p>In truth, Agatha didn't have to stay <em>completely</em> sober to function the next morning. Even if she woke up with a killer hangover, she could still call Greg to drive her to Wanda's or get an Uber.</p><p>But her filter and restraint tended to vanish whenever she had one drink too many, and she couldn't afford that near Rio. The last thing they needed was Agatha babbling about her feelings in the back of an Uber on the drive back home.</p><p>"Everybody will probably get shitfaced," Rio noticed slowly. "You don't want to experience that sober."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "I'll be fine," she said, walking into the garage. "Come on, Miss Always On Time. I don't need you breaking out in hives from being late."</p><p>They slid into the car, doors shutting with a soft thud that echoed through the garage. The engine purred to life beneath Agatha's hands, headlights splashing pale light across the wall as she backed out.</p><p>For a moment, the only sounds were the faint shuffle of seatbelts clicking into place, the muted rustle of fabric, and the automated voice of the GPS filling the quiet like a too-eager passenger.</p><p>Agatha kept her eyes on the road, one elbow braced against the door, her head resting on her palm while the other gripped the wheel. She felt Rio's glance as keenly as if it were a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>"You remember our drive to the gala?" Rio asked eventually, her voice calm, but not nostalgic.</p><p>Agatha nodded without looking away from the road. "Yeah. You labeled everyone there pretentious pricks before even seeing the party."</p><p>"And I was right," Rio chuckled, tapping her fingers lightly against her knee. "Anyway, you gave me a crash course on surviving that fever dream."</p><p>Agatha's brow lifted, but she didn't interrupt.</p><p>"So, since tonight's more my turf," Rio continued, turning her head to glance out the passenger window before adding. "I figured I should return the favor."</p><p>Agatha peeked at her sidelong. "Oh?"</p><p>"Yeah," Rio nodded to herself. "My first piece of advice was to get plastered, and I still encourage that."</p><p>"I'm not leaving my car in front of a random bar."</p><p>"Fair. Second, I know you're not a smoker, but if someone named Natasha offers you anything, don't take it. You'll be seeing things for hours," Rio said with a dry smile, her tone light but unmistakably serious. "And third," she turned her head again, eyes meeting Agatha's, "just don't try too hard. They'll like you more if you don't."</p><p>Agatha's hand on the wheel tightened reflexively. She shouldn't have been surprised that Rio had seen straight through her, past the polished exterior and into the mess of nerves knotted beneath. Even after weeks of silence, the distance hadn't dulled Rio's ability to read her like an open book.</p><p>Her jaw flexed as she forced her shoulders to ease back, letting out a breath that barely qualified as steady.</p><p>"You don't have to worry about that," she said eventually, voice quiet but clipped. "I won't embarrass you in front of your friends."</p><p>She meant it as a joke, <em>sort of</em>, but the humor landed off-center, just shy of convincing. Too tense around the edges.</p><p>Rio studied her for a beat longer, then looked ahead, her voice softer when she finally replied. "That's not what I meant."</p><p>Agatha didn't answer. She didn't have to because, mercifully, the bar Lilia had rented out for the night came into view, its warm neon sign glowing against the evening sky like a beacon. A group of people stood on the sidewalk, some holding cigarettes, others vapes, and their laughter mixed with the music bleeding through the slightly cracked windows.</p><p>She pulled into a tight spot across the street, killing the engine with a click that sounded like the starting gun of a race.</p><p>"Low attendance," Agatha noticed absentmindedly.</p><p>Rio unbuckled her seatbelt but didn't move to get out of the car. "We're only fifteen minutes late. Give it another hour."</p><p>Agatha hummed, lustrating the group, noting not one could be older than thirty. "Is it going to be just Alice's friends?"</p><p>"Yeah, Lilia organizes and pays for everything but never shows. Something about being too old for dealing with drunk twenty-somethings. But Alice's new girlfriend is gonna be here too," Rio's expression softened. "She'll probably get the heat of the interrogations since nobody's met her yet. Don't worry."</p><p>"I'm not worried," Agatha replied quickly, <em>too</em> quickly for it to sound convincing.</p><p>"Okay," Rio relented, hand hovering near the handle. "But if you <em>were</em> worried, I'd remind you that they're here to drink and dance and take pictures in a bathroom with terrible lighting. Not to play detectives and blow our covers."</p><p>Right, the lie: the sole reason she was here, the only way she could even exist in the space reserved for Rio's friends.</p><p>Agatha nodded, inhaling deeply. This was a performance above everything else. She wasn't here to have fun or convince Rio's inner circle to like her. She was here to sell a lie. "Right. Just smile and try not to look like I want to leave."</p><p>"Exactly," Rio grinned, finally pushing the door open. "And if it helps, Billy's stories about you made everyone think you're hot and terrifying, so the bar's pretty low."</p><p>"Comforting," Agatha muttered, grabbing the gift bag from the backseat before stepping into the evening air.</p><p>They crossed the street together, side by side, but not touching. There was a strange ease to the quiet between them now, less strained, like the need to act overpowered whatever darkened their interactions at home. Agatha rolled her shoulders back, straightened her posture, and forced her nerves into submission just as they approached the group outside the entrance.</p><p>The reaction was immediate.</p><p>"Rio!"</p><p>"Holy shit, you actually brought a date?!"</p><p>"She's her <em>wife</em>, you idiot. Do you ever pay attention?"</p><p>"Okay, but how the fuck did you pull <em>her</em>?"</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, delivering a light smack on the back of the last speaker's head. "Fuck off, Carol. I have game."</p><p>The blonde - Carol, Agatha noted, fully aware that she'd forget the name in ten minutes - grinned and batted Rio's hand away. "The ones on your Switch don't count, nerd."</p><p>"Jock," Rio shot back without heat, scanning the group. "And that reaction just cost you your introduction privileges. Where's Alice?"</p><p>"Don't be like that," another woman broke in, shouldering her way to the front. She was shorter, hair half-pulled up with glitter clipped into it, and beaming like they'd known each other forever. "Hi! I'm Kamala - it's <em>so </em>nice to meet you. We've heard so many things! And honestly, you're even hotter than-"</p><p>Agatha didn't get to find out the end of that sentence.</p><p>Rio's arm came around her waist easily, as if it was the most natural gesture in the world for them, and steered her firmly but gently toward the door. "And that's enough. We'll see you inside."</p><p>"Oh, you can count on that!" someone called after them, followed by a chorus of laughter and exaggerated wolf whistles just as the door swung shut behind them.</p><p>The music inside was louder, the kind that vibrated up through the soles of your shoes and settled somewhere behind your ribs. Colored lights strobed along the brick walls, casting everything in a rotating wash of all the colors of the rainbow, and the smell of beer, perfume, and fried food hung in the air.</p><p>Agatha blinked as her eyes adjusted, the transition from the sidewalk to the dancefloor like stepping through a portal. Rio's hand was still on her waist, warm and grounding, and she wasn't sure if it was for show or support - not that it mattered. It worked either way.</p><p>"Still sure about staying sober?" Rio asked, leaning closer to be heard over the music.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath that might've been a laugh. "I used to sit through <em>work events</em> sober. This is nothing."</p><p>"You're braver than I," Rio smiled, and in the dim light, it looked softer than she probably intended. "Though we'll see how you manage after they're too drunk for filters."</p><p>"That was the filtered version?"</p><p>"Oh, yeah," Rio pulled her forward and across the almost empty dance floor. The rest of the guests certainly didn't share Rio's obsessive punctuality. "You're in for a ride."</p><p>Agatha felt some of the tension in her spine coil but smirked. "Hopefully, Alice's new girlfriend takes the spotlight."</p><p>They moved to the far side of the bar, where the lighting shifted from pulsing neons to a softer amber glow. Here, the music was dialed down to a more manageable thump - still present, but no longer drowning out conversations. It was a pocket of calm within the chaos, clearly set up for people who preferred to talk without shouting over synth-heavy remixes.</p><p>A long, leather upholstered booth stretched along the back wall, flanked by mismatched chairs and a few low tables cluttered with half-finished drinks and abandoned glittery party favors. A projector hung from the ceiling, casting a slightly skewed image of a karaoke menu onto a white screen on the opposite wall.</p><p>Thankfully, the partygoers had not yet noticed it or were too sober to wield the prepared microphones like weapons. Agatha could only imagine the kind of hell the room would become once somebody got the ball rolling.</p><p>Just as she was about to voice her concerns to Rio, she caught sight of Alice, leaning back against a table stacked with gift bags and haphazardly wrapped parcels, smiling at-</p><p>"Jen?"</p><p>The two jumped away from each other like caught teenagers, their heads whipping around in shock. Rio laughed, her hand slipping off Agatha's waist as they approached the pair. "Why are you surprised to see us? You <em>knew</em> we'd be here."</p><p>"Which can't be said for everyone," Agatha commented, narrowing her eyes at Jen. "You dragged me to that God-awful bar months ago to ogle Alice?"</p><p>"It resulted in you getting married, so you're welcome," Jen scoffed. "And it wasn't to <em>ogle.</em> I have class."</p><p>Agatha snorted at that, but before she could form a retort, Rio piped in. "Does Lilia know?"</p><p>"Lilia knows <em>everything</em>," Alice groaned, smoothing out her mesh blouse. "She clocked it before we even told her. That woman is a witch," her eyes slid down to the gift bag in Agatha's hand. "That for me?"</p><p>"Um, yeah," Agatha said, handing over the gift back like it might self-destruct if held too long.</p><p>Alice took it with a brief, surprised smile and held Agatha's gaze a beat longer than expected. "Thanks," she said, voice softer than it had been at their last encounter. "You didn't have to."</p><p>"It's your birthday," Agatha replied automatically. "It's nothing big. Just something nice."</p><p>Alice peeked into the bag, eyebrows lifting in appreciation. "A music sheet clip?" she said slowly, fishing the object out of the bag. It was gold-plated and elegantly curved, polished yet understated.</p><p>Agatha fiddled with her wedding ring. "Rio mentioned you were studying the piano, so I thought it might be helpful," she shrugged to hide the unease crawling up her spine.</p><p>"That's," Alice pursed her lips, then smiled again like she'd made up her mind about something, "<em>very</em> nice, actually. I was expecting some fancy alcohol at best."</p><p>"Oh, there's wine, too."</p><p>Alice laughed, gently putting the clip back and setting the bag on the table. "Everything a musician can hope for, then."</p><p>Agatha chuckled despite herself. The tension she'd braced for - something biting or cold - didn't come. Maybe she'd misjudged. Or maybe Alice was just better at compartmentalizing than she'd given her credit for.</p><p>Before she could overanalyze the interaction, Rio tilted her head and stepped in, all curious eyes and mischief. "Okay, I have to ask - how did this happen?" she gestured between Alice and Jen, who were now very pointedly not standing too close but also not pretending to be strangers. "And when?"</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes, already bracing for impact. "It's not that interesting."</p><p>Alice, however, grinned. "Says the woman who took over two months to ask me out. And did it by shoving a napkin with her phone number at me and almost running out of the bar."</p><p>"I didn't run," Jen mumbled, eyes narrowing.</p><p>"You almost face-slammed into the door," Alice said.</p><p>"Because I didn't see it."</p><p>Rio barked out a laugh. "It's solid wood. Kinda hard to miss."</p><p>"You were right, Jen," Agatha smirked. "Your <em>class </em>is impeccable."</p><p>"Kudos for the napkin, though," Rio said, clearly delighted. "It's a lost art between phones and apps."</p><p>Agatha's smirk faltered for a fraction of a second, the sound of Alice's teasing laughter fading beneath the weight of a different memory she hadn't invited.</p><p>That napkin.</p><p>She hadn't looked at it in weeks, but she could still picture the faint smudge of Rio's pen, the hurried slope of her handwriting, and the black heart doodled at the bottom. It had been pressed into her hand months ago after Rio's proposal.</p><p>Agatha had fully intended to toss it. Several times, actually. Once that same night, again the next morning, and a dozen more in the weeks that followed. But every time she opened her nightstand drawer and noticed the napkin, something stopped her.</p><p>Not sentiment, she told herself. Maybe it was logistics. Forgetting it was there. Or not caring enough to go through the drawer.</p><p>But that wasn't true. She'd moved it aside to reach for a charger once and had paused, fingers hovering just long enough to acknowledge the tug in her chest before closing the drawer again.</p><p>It didn't make sense to keep it. But it didn't make sense to throw it away, either.</p><p>Agatha blinked back to the present as Alice turned to grab a stray glitter crown from the table and handed it to Jen with mock ceremony. "Here. For your bravery."</p><p>Jen took it without complaint and placed it on her head like it was a tiara, then looked at Agatha. "You can mock me later. She's worth it."</p><p>And strangely, that didn't sound defensive. Just... true.</p><p>Agatha looked at Alice again and felt a pang in her chest. Their happiness was palpable, humming in the air like static before a storm. Genuine and untangled.</p><p>Nothing was weighing them down - no quiet negotiations, no rehearsed interactions, no contract lines dictating what counted as real and what didn't. There was just the soft, shared glow of two people finding something good and letting it be that way.</p><p>And watching that uncomplicated kind of joy was, well, harder than she thought it would be.</p><p>It wasn't jealousy, exactly - Agatha would rather die than find herself jealous over anything of Jen's. It was more like grief for a version of herself that might have once believed it could be that easy. A version untouched by her mother's cruelty, maybe. Or at least unaware of its impact.</p><p>Rio nudged her elbow, snapping her back to the present. "C'mon," she said, her hand fitting into Agatha's effortlessly. "People are flooding in. Let's get drinks before we get roped into karaoke against our will."</p><p>Agatha followed her wordlessly, her mind still somewhere between the napkin and the joy shining in Alice's eyes.</p><hr/><p>They claimed a corner of the booth toward the back, far enough from the dancefloor to hear each other, close enough to observe the people moving through the space. The leather stuck lightly to Agatha's back, a gentle reminder of the rising temperature in the bar, caused by the steady flow of new faces. Beside her, Rio dropped into the seat with the ease of someone who belonged, stretching one arm along the top of the booth.</p><p>Agatha's eyes scanned the room. The party hadn't taken off yet, but it buzzed with a strange, pre-chaos energy. People talked loudly but didn't shout over the tables. Their hands were steadily cradling their drinks without spilling them over the floor. Somebody even managed to start a group selfie. It was a particular kind of calm before a storm.</p><p>None of it felt familiar, but that wasn't necessarily bad. She wasn't being cornered, grilled, or pitied. No one was pressing too hard, not even Carol, who gave her a thumbs-up from across the room like they were co-conspirators. It was almost tolerable.</p><p>"You okay?" Rio leaned in, voice pitched low enough not to carry.</p><p>Agatha nodded, letting her gaze linger on Alice and Jen, now standing with another group, holding onto each other like they were the sole survivors of a wreckage at sea.</p><p>"Better than expected," Agatha admitted. "Ask me again when somebody discovers the karaoke machine."</p><p>"Oh, that's only a matter of time," Rio said with a grin. "I saw Kamala eying it, and she always ropes someone into singing a duet. Who knows, maybe tonight's your lucky night."</p><p>Agatha gave her a sidelong look. "Please tell me you're joking."</p><p>"Nope. Your only hope is that she tries with Jen first."</p><p>"Well, I'd pay to see that."</p><p>They shared a quiet laugh, and for a second, the noise around them faded into the background. Agatha tilted her head against the booth and let her shoulders settle. Maybe she wouldn't have to fake every minute of this.</p><p>"I think Teen's trying to communicate with you via blinking," she added, flicking her gaze toward her assistant, who stood awkwardly across the room with a man Agatha didn't recognize. The poor kid was squinting like a Morse code operator.</p><p>Rio followed her line of sight and smirked. Billy dropped his eyes the second he noticed them looking.</p><p>"You know he's only a year younger than me, right?" she asked. "Why call him Teen?"</p><p>"It's not about age," Agatha said flatly. "Look at him. I almost didn't hire him because he couldn't finish a sentence without apologizing for it."</p><p>"And yet you did," Rio noted, that grin returning.</p><p>"Watching him flounder was entertaining," Agatha shrugged. "Plus, he introduced himself as Billy."</p><p>"Like your godson," Rio teased, leaning in with mock innocence. "You big softie."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the warmth in her cheeks betrayed her. "I am <em>not</em> a softie."</p><p>"The evidence speaks for itself," Rio said, tapping her knee playfully. "C'mon. Let's go say hi."</p><p>Agatha glanced at Billy again, noting his nervous energy. More so than usual. "I think he'll combust if I approach him. I'm good here."</p><p>Rio hesitated for a beat too long. Her eyes lingered on Agatha like she was deciding whether to push or stay. Eventually, she let out a soft breath and straightened.</p><p>"Suit yourself," she said, voice easy. "Don't run while I'm gone. I have eyes everywhere and <em>will</em> know. I'll try to be back by the time Kamala finds you for the duet."</p><p>"To save me?"</p><p>Rio grinned. "To record it."</p><p>She watched Rio walk away, the crowd parting easily around her like she belonged there. A few heads turned, subtly or not, to track her movements.</p><p>"So, you're the lucky gal," came a voice to Agatha's right, low, amused, and unmistakably directed at her.</p><p>She turned to find a woman with short copper-red hair and a crooked smile sliding into the booth beside her like they'd known each other for years. Her presence was easy but unignorable.</p><p>"Depends on what you're referring to..." Agatha trailed off, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>"Natasha. One of Rio's long-suffering friends," she said, holding out her hand as if this were the beginning of a high-stakes poker game. "You can imagine how surprised I was to learn she was married. Seemingly out of the blue."</p><p>Agatha shook her hand, spine straightening as the words activated her like a sleeper agent. That was the reason she came here: the interrogation. And from the subtle mistrust masked under a layer of polite curiosity, she could tell Natasha would not be fooled easily.</p><p>She gave a small, practiced smile. "I feel like <em>surprise </em>doesn't cover even half of it."</p><p>Natasha leaned back slightly, letting her arm drape along the back of the booth, fingers tapping absently near Agatha's shoulder. "Fair. Maybe <em>disbelief </em>is more accurate," she mused, eyes narrowing in a way that wasn't unfriendly but evaluative. "You know, Rio's been very insistent that this <em>isn't</em> a sugar mommy situation."</p><p>Agatha's jaw tensed before she could stop it. That phrase - clinical, careless - landed like a slap. She wasn't naive about how it might look from the outside. And there <em>was</em> money involved, even if Natasha was unaware of it. There <em>was</em> a contract and unmovable rules. But she wasn't upset by how close Natasha had gotten to the true nature of their arrangement.</p><p>She was upset because that was Rio's friends' first thought.</p><p>Her voice was cool when it came. "People marry their sugar mommies now? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose?"</p><p>Natasha's brows rose, but a grin tugged at the corner of her mouth. "Touché."</p><p>There was a beat. The tapping stopped.</p><p>"Don't take it personally," Natasha added more quietly. "Rio's just a bit of a lone wolf - always has been. She doesn't get attached or let people in. I've always thought she'd die married to the idea of changing the world and her garden."</p><p>"One would think I was a better option."</p><p>Natasha's eyes flicked over her, undeterred by her stern tone. "You seem to be," she said thoughtfully. "In a way that counts, at least."</p><p>Agatha let the silence stretch between them for a beat, not rushing to fill it. Natasha wasn't pushing anymore, just observing, and Agatha felt like she'd passed a test she didn't know she even cared about.</p><p>"You know," Natasha added after a sip of her drink, "I wasn't trying to be a bitch earlier. About your relationship, I mean. My only perception of you was through Billy's stories from work, and when Rio said she married you, well, it made her seem unhinged."</p><p>Agatha frowned, refusing to let that sting. "And your go-to theory was that I'm her sponsor?"</p><p>"I can admit when I'm wrong," Natasha said calmly. "I can also see that you two make sense."</p><p>"You don't know me."</p><p>"I don't have to," Natasha shrugged. "Knowing Rio is enough. She's always been one of those people who carry the world like a backpack full of bricks. Never accepts help, never shares the weight. But when she got hurt..." her eyes flicked toward the far end of the bar, where Rio stood laughing with a hand over her heart, the other holding an empty shot glass. "She just let you take care of her. Trusted you to do it, even. Whatever this is, it's doing something good to her. It makes her seem lighter."</p><p>Agatha followed her gaze. Rio had tilted her head back mid-laugh, relaxed and magnetic in a way Agatha still didn't quite understand. It was the same unguarded expression she remembered from <em>before</em>.</p><p>"Maybe she just finally got tired of carrying things alone," Agatha said, not quite realizing she'd spoken aloud.</p><p>Natasha hummed. "Maybe. Or maybe she found someone willing to carry it with her."</p><p>Agatha's instinct was to deflect, to twist the comment into something clever and dismissive. It wasn't true. If anything, she'd been <em>adding</em> to the weight on Rio's shoulders, making her carry the deal, the silence, and everything that had happened between them.</p><p>But before she could settle on something that would dismiss Natasha's words without unveiling the lie, Rio materialized beside the booth like a conjured ghost.</p><p>"Why are you harassing my wife?" she asked good-naturedly, eyeing Natasha with mock suspicion. "She's taken, you know."</p><p>The redhead gave a theatrical sigh and slid dramatically across the booth, planting herself on the far edge like Agatha might be contagious. "I was trying to determine if being married to you is just as migraine-inducing as being your friend."</p><p>Rio laughed, low and rich, the sound curling around Agatha like smoke. There was something looser in her now, almost tipsy, like the edges had blurred just enough to let something tender slip through. "Must've been devastating to realize I'm an absolute delight."</p><p>"Jury's still out," Agatha murmured, smirking as her eyes met Rio's.</p><p>That grin widened, and Rio let out a mock gasp, staggering back a step. "And here I was, ready to rescue you from this booth with the promise of a dance."</p><p>The word struck like flint.</p><p>
<em>A dance.</em>
</p><p>Agatha felt it reverberate in her chest, her mind instantly dragging her back to <em>that</em> night. Their first - and only - dance, spontaneous but still polished and deliberate. A neatly executed waltz in a gilded room that was meant to sell a lie.</p><p>And yet, it hadn't <em>felt</em> like a lie.</p><p>Not when Rio's hand settled in her like it belonged there. Not when they moved in sync, unspeaking, but understood. It was supposed to be the starting gun of their ruse - a test to see how many would believe in their marriage. But somehow, it had started the unraveling instead. Because somewhere in the quiet between steps, Agatha had felt the first crack: Rio, not just as a solution, but as something terrifyingly real.</p><p>And now she was asking her to do it again.</p><p>"A dance?" Agatha repeated, voice thinner than she intended. It sounded like a protest. It felt like a plea.</p><p>Natasha, still watching her with sharp but not unkind eyes, offered a shrug. "The floor's packed. All you can really do is sway."</p><p>The supposedly encouraging comment made it worse. Agatha didn't care about dancing in a room full of people with everyone looking at them. She did, however, care about standing in Rio's orbit again, so close her breath would find the hollow beneath Agatha's jaw. So close her body might remember things Agatha had spent a month trying to forget.</p><p>She didn't know if she could be that near and return to the charged silences when the night ended.</p><p>Her brain scrambled for an exit - an excuse or a joke, anything to preserve the fragile space between them. But then Rio pouted, full and exaggerated, like she already knew Agatha was considering bolting.</p><p>"C'mon," she said. "You don't wanna dance with your wife?"</p><p>Agatha, suddenly ashamed of the way she'd recoiled from something that wasn't even real, forced herself to breathe.</p><p>Rio was still trying. Still covering for both of them in front of her friends, giving them something they could believe in. And here Agatha was, pulling away.</p><p>
<em>Get your fucking head in the game.</em>
</p><p>"Well," she sighed, gesturing to Rio's ridiculous pout, "I can't really say no to <em>that </em>face."</p><p>Rio's grin was instant, blooming with triumph. "Knew I'd win you over," she extended her hand with a playful flourish. "M'lady. Shall we?"</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a breath that felt like a held heartbeat, then slid her fingers into Rio's.</p><p>"Lead the way, <em>delight</em>," she said, going for playful.</p><p>Rio's fingers curled tightly around hers, steadier than Agatha suspected they would be, as she was pulled to her feet.</p><p>"Later, loser," Rio threw over her shoulder, earning a mock scoff from Natasha before they melted into the crowd.</p><p>They slipped between strangers, the wall of bodies growing denser as they navigated the dancefloor. The smell of alcohol, sweat, and various perfumes hung in the air, a unique combination that sank into clothes and hair, sticking to them like fog.</p><p>Agatha let herself be guided through the mess of spilled drinks and the props taken from Alice's table - glittery crowns perched in messy hair, glow-in-the-dark sticks stuffed behind collars, and party hats balancing precariously on moving heads. The music pulsed, low and languid, giving just enough rhythm to sway.</p><p>Rio turned to face her, sliding one hand to her waist with mild pressure. She'd picked a less crowded portion of the dancefloor, but the fit was still too tight to put any real space between them. Even without the gentle nudge of the palm pressing against her lower back, Agatha would have no other choice but to stand close enough to count Rio's eyelashes.</p><p>Then, Rio leaned forward, her breath brushing against Agatha's cheek. "Not enough room for waltzing, I'm afraid," she muttered teasingly, squeezing Agatha's hand one last time before transferring it onto her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha's fingers curled into the material of her blazer instinctively, feeling the heat of Rio's skin even through the layers. The music vibrated faintly in her chest, but the pulse she felt most was Rio's, steadily thudding through the inches between them.</p><p>The strobe lights spun through the space in chaotic bursts, drenching Rio's eyes in color. Brown irises lit with electric blue and gold like fireflies had wandered in and decided to stay.</p><p>It was worse than the gala.</p><p>There, the lights had been cold and even, transforming the dancefloor into a surgical table - every move on display, every glance transparent and scrutinized. Even though it didn't stop the waltz from denting her composure, there had been a certain aura of formality to it. Detachment.</p><p>Here, shadows stretched long and slow between flashes. The press of bodies wasn't performative but incidental and chaotic. There was no stage or curated audience: just Rio and the heat of her. And the barely-there distance.</p><p>It was dangerous in a different way.</p><p>The song slowed, the bass deep and rattling in their bones. Rio moved gently, guiding Agatha in a rhythm that was more a shared sway than an actual dance. Her fingers at Agatha's waist flexed subtly, pulling her a fraction closer. Close enough that Agatha could feel the movement of her breathing, the way it hitched and smoothed out again.</p><p>"Did Nat say something?" Rio asked softly, her lips close to Agatha's ear now. To make sure she was heard over the music or to paint the right picture, Agatha didn't know.</p><p>"No, why?"</p><p>Rio pulled back slightly, not enough to break contact but to see her face. "You seem tense."</p><p>Agatha hesitated. The full story of what Natasha had said formed on her tongue, but this wasn't the time or place. Instead, she smirked, a well-practiced curl of her lips to mask the slow burn of heat left by Rio's hands on her hips.</p><p>"It was just a friendly chat. With some comments about sugar mommies."</p><p>Rio's nose wrinkled instantly. "I'm gonna kill her," she muttered, her fingers tightening at Agatha's sides. The pressure should've felt like a grounding anchor, but instead, it shot lightning up Agatha's spine. Her breath hitched, caught completely off guard - not by the comment, but by the intimacy.</p><p>Rio stilled. She must've taken it for discomfort because her touch gentled immediately, fingers tracing slow, apologetic circles over Agatha's hips like she could erase whatever had made her flinch.</p><p>"I'm sorry about her," Rio said, voice dripping with sincerity. "She shouldn't have said that."</p><p>Agatha shook her head, trying to clear the fuzz that clung to the edges of her thoughts. "It's fine. She wasn't that far off, anyway."</p><p>Rio stilled mid-step.</p><p>The sway between them fractured for the briefest second, her body going taut beneath Agatha's hands. Agatha felt the tension gather in her shoulders, her back, as if someone had yanked a string tight behind her ribs.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Agatha blinked, startled by the sudden shift in tone. She ran her hands up to Rio's shoulders instinctively, trying to smooth out the tight lines that formed. "I mean... I <em>am</em> paying you to be married to me," she said, her voice dipping slightly. "Different terms, but still."</p><p>There was a pause, not the kind of lull that came naturally in a conversation, but the kind that sucked the air out of the room.</p><p>Rio's face didn't change dramatically. She didn't recoil or snap. But something inside her shifted. The glint in her eyes - playful, <em>fond</em> - dulled to something reserved, like she'd just remembered what they were.</p><p>She dropped her gaze to Agatha's collarbone for a beat, then lifted it again, composed but quieter.</p><p>"Right," she said.</p><p>Just that. Just <em>right: </em>simple and clean, and so stark it made Agatha frown.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Nothing," Rio's smile returned, but it was practiced now. Polished. The kind that looked good from a distance but wouldn't survive a close inspection. "I just thought..."</p><p>"Thought what?"</p><p>Rio's hand flexed gently at Agatha's waist, not pulling her closer but not letting go either. "It doesn't matter. We shouldn't discuss it here."</p><p>The music swelled - a shift to something slower, more romantic, ironically. Around them, couples pressed together, and the chaotic haze took on a softer hue.</p><p>Agatha stared at her, confused. "I didn't mean to-"</p><p>"I know what you meant," Rio interrupted, and this time, her smile was too tired to be convincing. "And you were right; this <em>is</em> transactional. I just... thought we'd be free of that here."</p><p>They moved again, the swaying mechanical now, rhythm without feeling. Agatha's heart thumped dully beneath her ribs, not quite understanding why her words had landed so hard.</p><p>"What do you mean by <em>free of that</em>?" she asked, eyebrows scrunched.</p><p>Rio didn't answer right away. She glanced past Agatha's shoulder and toward the glittering blur of lights and dancers. When she finally met her eyes again, the expression there was impossible to read.</p><p>"It doesn't matter," she repeated.</p><p>It was a lie, and Agatha knew it.</p><p>But she also knew Rio wasn't going to elaborate. Not here. Not now. Maybe not ever.</p><p>Before she could press, Rio's gaze flicked away again, this time toward an approaching figure.</p><p>"Here you are!" Alice all but elbowed her way through the crowd, effectively ruining some couple's makeout, her smile drunken and contagious. "If I didn't know better, I'd think you snuck off for a quickie in the bathroom."</p><p>Rio chuckled, the sound strained and too high-pitched to be genuine. "We were just dancing," she said, slipping out of Agatha's hold in a single, fluid step.</p><p>"Well, I want shots," Alice's gaze flicked to Agatha, who could still feel Rio's hands on her hips and the phantom press of her voice against her ear. "You in?"</p><p>Agatha blinked, flexing her fingers to rid them of the residual warmth of Rio's skin. "No, thank you. I should probably get some fresh air. Check on my son."</p><p>Nobody protested, even though her voice broke on the meager excuse.</p><p>"I'll find you later," Rio promised, almost like an afterthought, letting Alice tug her away and toward the bar.</p><p>Agatha stood still for a moment, watching them disappear in the sea of swaying bodies until Rio's rigid back was out of sight. The word <em>free</em> echoed in her mind like a whispered confession when she turned in the opposite direction, navigating the tight space to reach the exit.</p><p>The fresh air hit her lungs like a first breath after being submerged for too long. She leaned against the side of the building, away from the main crush of smokers and laughter, where the music thumped through the walls but couldn't quite reach her.</p><p>Her body still tingled where Rio had touched her.</p><p>She crossed her arms tightly, eyes swiping mindlessly across the street. The sidewalk on the other side was almost empty, aside from a man pacing back and forth with a phone pressed tightly to his ear. Agatha let his movements distract her momentarily before he disappeared into an alley, letting the dark swallow him. Without anything to focus on, the word clung.</p><p>
<em>Free.</em>
</p><p>They <em>had</em> agreed to be free from the deal for the night, at least to some extent. The idea had been to kill two birds with one stone: a moment to have fun and unwind while they crossed a public appearance off the list of things expected of them.</p><p>And for a while, it had worked.</p><p>They'd laughed and teased. Exchanged glances that didn't feel loaded and touches that felt unforced.</p><p>But then, she'd said it.</p><p><em>I </em>am <em>paying you to be married to me.</em></p><p>She hadn't meant it like <em>that</em>. It wasn't supposed to be cruel or distancing. It was just, well, <em>reality</em>. Something solid to anchor herself to when the floor had started to shift beneath her feet.</p><p>Because the night had started to feel dangerously easy.</p><p>The words had been a tether, or maybe more like a cinderblock - something heavy enough to keep her from floating off into a fantasy she had no right to indulge in. A fantasy where Rio smiled at her like that because she <em>wanted to</em>. Where the warmth in her voice wasn't part of the act. Where Agatha could reach out and touch her without wondering what it meant.</p><p>She hadn't thought it would hurt.</p><p>Well, not Rio, anyway.</p><p>Because Rio had pulled away without a fight or a word of protest the moment Agatha had asked. She'd agreed to redraw the line and stayed within its bounds, like it didn't make a difference to her, making a pointed effort to stay away.</p><p>It didn't make sense for her to flinch at the reminder.</p><p>But it also didn't make sense how easily the night had come to them. How effortless slipping back into laughing together and enjoying each other's company had felt.</p><p>The slight tremor in Rio's voice echoed in her mind.</p><p>
<em>I thought we'd be free of that here.</em>
</p><p>Free of what? Of the tension? Of the lie?</p><p>Or of the need to <em>remember</em> it was one?</p><p>Agatha sighed, leaning her head back against the brick wall of the bar.</p><p>There was one explanation.</p><p>Her mind circled it like a hawk too afraid to dive. It was the only thing that made any real sense - why Rio had become overtly distant, why Alice had looked at her differently when they'd spoken before she left, why a simple, clinical reminder of their arrangement had landed like a gut punch.</p><p>It explained the shift in Rio's tone and the cracked softness in her eyes that she'd tried to bury under a practiced smile.</p><p>But Agatha had spent her life reading subtext and tearing fantasy from fact. She's learned long ago not to trust what she <em>wanted</em> things to mean.</p><p>So she didn't trust it now.</p><p>Because the explanation - the one that made her chest ache and her thoughts scatter - was the one thing she couldn't afford to believe.</p><p>That maybe Rio had been hurt because she <em>cared</em>.</p><p>Because Agatha wasn't just some paycheck, wasn't just a role to play. Maybe Rio had stopped pretending long before tonight.</p><p>But Agatha knew better than to believe a hopeful delusion.</p><p>She'd made the lines. She'd asked for distance. She'd set the rules to protect herself, to keep things clean, and Rio had followed them to a fault.</p><p>It would be stupid to take the plunge now. To unfurl all the hurt for the faintest chance of not experiencing it anymore.</p><p>It was safer to trust her head than her heart.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hi! Okay, so I definitely didn't plan for the party to be divided into two chapters, but turns out these two have minds of their own and the chapter would be, well, really fucking long if I didn't split it. Considering that I planned this story to be about as long as it already is, I'm not even surprised. I'm a walking definition of make the plan, execute the plan, expect the plan to go off the rails, throw away the plan.<br/>Anyway, I won't say anything about my possible tardiness (istg I feel like a liar every time I write the chapter on time after telling you I might be late). Let's just agree that if the chapter is on time, then yay, and if not, then it will be up eventually.<br/>As always, thank you for the kudos and the comments (answering to one: I do have socials under the same name, but I only use them as the creepy lurker who never posts anything).

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha stayed outside longer than she'd planned.</p><p>The music still pulsed through the walls behind her, a steady heartbeat she no longer felt part of. She'd texted Wanda about Nicky a while ago, fingers flying with practiced guilt. The response came back seconds later: <em>He's fine, stop worrying. Focus on bringing back gossip</em>.</p><p>But Agatha remained where she was, her spine pressed against the cool brick like it was the only thing keeping her upright. The alley wasn't quiet - distant music, laughter, the occasional shriek of a passing car - but none of it felt close enough to touch her.</p><p>Her gaze kept drifting to the other side of the street. Her car was parked beneath a lamp post, glinting like a beacon of hope. The keys were in her purse. Her hand brushed against them more than once, her fingers curling and uncurling around the thoughts of escape.</p><p>All she had to do was cross the street, climb into the driver's seat, and disappear into the night before she could make things worse. Before she said something else that she didn't mean to be cruel, but couldn't take back.</p><p>Running had always been her solution. Her brand, even.</p><p>When things got tangled and emotionally dense with affection, Agatha ran. She left before anyone else could. Before they saw too much. Before they found the parts of her she kept locked down, the ones even she couldn't look at too long without flinching.</p><p>She told herself it was practical: efficient in her hectic life, which held no room for another responsibility.</p><p>But the truth was uglier; it always was. Agatha ran because she didn't believe she was someone worth staying for. And if she left first, at least she got to pretend it was her choice.</p><p>Still, as tempting as that glowing exit sign was, she knew it wasn't real.</p><p>She <em>could</em> text Rio and say something came up. With Nicky, probably, so Rio wouldn't think twice before saying she understood. She could vanish with all the grace of a practiced liar.</p><p>But none of it would change the fact that they'd still be living under the same roof, orbiting the same lie like moons and pretending the same gravity didn't pull them.</p><p>And worse, running would <em>confirm </em>something. To Rio. To herself. That she really <em>had</em> meant it the way it sounded. That the truth of their arrangement was the only truth that mattered.</p><p>Agatha exhaled hard, yanking her hand out of her purse without the keys. Then she pushed off the wall, her heels clicking against the pavement as she rounded the corner.</p><p>She wasn't going to run tonight. Not because she didn't want to, but because she knew what would be waiting for her if she did: silence, distance, and a woman she was still pretending not to miss.</p><p>And a part of her - a selfish, masochistic part - wanted to prolong the agony. Wanted to bask in the pretense of normality before Rio withdrew again.</p><p>Yeah, she needed to go back in.</p><p>Find Rio, smile through it, and carry on like she hadn't said something that fractured the easy rhythm they'd built.</p><p>Because if she couldn't undo the damage, then she'd at least pretend the wound didn't exist.</p><p>That, too, was something she was good at.</p><p>The music swallowed her whole as soon as she stepped back inside.</p><p>It was louder now, or maybe it just felt that way. The bodies that had once made the floor feel warm and vibrant now felt like clutter. Something to wade through.</p><p>She scanned the crowd, avoiding looking at anyone directly, not up for another interrogation. Her eyes found Rio almost instantly, like they'd been conditioned to see her even in the densest crowds.</p><p>She was leaning against the bar: one elbow braced against the counter, the other arm dangling loosely at her side. She looked soft around the edges, dimmed like someone had turned down the saturation on her usually sharp lines. Her blazer was open, the buttons of her shirt slightly skewed, and her smile when Alice said something was too slow to be real.</p><p>Agatha approached with measured steps, keeping her expression neutral as if she were walking into a business meeting and not in the aftermath of something she couldn't yet name.</p><p>Jen spotted her first. Her eyebrows rose to the plastic crown still on her head. "And she lives. I was about to organize a search party."</p><p>Rio turned at that. Her gaze met Agatha's, and for a moment, she didn't smile. She just looked at her.</p><p>Her eyes were a little glassy, shoulders loose.</p><p>Then she blinked, straightening slightly. "Nicky alright?" she asked, voice slurred but still clear. The playfulness from earlier was gone.</p><p>Agatha nodded, folding her arms. "Yeah."</p><p>Alice looked between them with a frown but didn't comment on the frostiness. Maybe she didn't need to. Maybe Rio had already told her everything.</p><p>The silence stretched for a moment before Rio leaned forward, grabbing one of the shot glasses splayed out on the counter and draining it in one swallow.</p><p>Agatha noted the accumulated amount of empty glasses in front of her - at least two more than on Alice's side. And accounting for the time she'd been gone...</p><p>"You shouldn't drink so fast," she murmured, more out of habit than concern.</p><p>"Why?" Rio said a little too lightly. "I'm having fun in any way I can."</p><p>Jen chuckled, either oblivious to the tension thickening in the air or too drunk to care. "I told her she was drinking like she wanted to forget who she married," she quipped.</p><p>Agatha's stomach knotted.</p><p>Rio just shrugged. "Maybe I do."</p><p>The words weren't pointed or intentionally cruel. But they had a weight that landed with too much precision to be offhand.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, letting her hand graze the edge of the bar beside Rio's. She didn't touch her, though. Didn't feel like she had the right to.</p><p>"Can we-"</p><p>She never got the question out.</p><p>Carol pushed through the crowd with the grace of a bulldozer, leaving a trail of spilled drinks and shouts of protest in her wake. Her blue eyes shone with mischief as she approached the group, immediately seizing Rio's wrist.</p><p>"Your turn, dude!" she hollered, half-laughing, half-shouting over the music. "Billy's almost done!"</p><p>Agatha blinked, confused. "I'm sorry, what?"</p><p>Carol turned to her with a wide grin. "Your lady love promised to sing," she said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "She's going after Billy 'cause he always picks some sad emo shit, and apparently, her song fits the vibe."</p><p>Before Agatha could speak - stop her, question her - Rio downed one last shot like a dare and let herself be led away without resistance.</p><p>As the two disappeared around the corner, Agatha stood frozen.</p><p>It was Alice who moved beside her this time. She'd been silent throughout the exchange, observing more than participating, but her gaze followed Rio's retreating form like she was considering something.</p><p>Then her eyes cut sideways to Agatha.</p><p>"You probably don't want to miss that," she said softly, her voice knowing.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a brief moment before nodding jerkily, her feet carrying her down the path Carol and Rio had taken.</p><p>By the time she reached the edge of the karaoke room, the crowd had already gathered. The lights were lower than during her conversation with Natasha, more intimate. It felt like a spotlight waiting to be struck, and in the middle of it stood Rio, steady and unflinching.</p><p>Agatha held her breath.</p><p>The opening notes played - slow and smoldering.</p><p><em>Wicked Game</em>.</p><p>The crowd quieted, ears perking up at the unusual choice, murmurs falling away into the weight of the first line.</p><p>
<em>The world was on fire, and no one could save me but you...</em>
</p><p>Agatha stood still at the threshold, half-shadowed as the low, aching drawl filled the space. The intimacy of the song gripped the air like a slow tide, pulling everyone in with it, especially Agatha, who couldn't look anywhere else but at Rio.</p><p>She didn't overperform it. There was no theatrical flair, no posturing or exaggerated gestures. Just her and the mic, one hand loosely gripping the stand while the other curled around nothing at her side.</p><p>Her voice was husky from the shots, but it suited the song - made it raw and velvet-edged. <em>Real</em>.</p><p>
<em>I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.</em>
</p><p>Agatha felt her muscles tense as if bracing for impact.</p><p>She knew what was coming. She'd seen the lyrics enough times to brace for the hit they would deliver to her chest, squeezing the air out of her lungs.</p><p>But the blow never came.</p><p>The screen lit up with the bold white letters as the chorus approached, the music rising like a tide. But Rio's lips didn't move. Her eyes flicked over the words - clearly reading, clearly aware - but she didn't sing them. Didn't even mouth them.</p><p>The room, already quiet in that fragile way that only true attention brings, seemed to still even further. The absence of her voice felt louder than any melody. A suspended moment, dense with intention.</p><p>She let the chorus pass by like a train she refused to board.</p><p>Then, as if nothing had happened, she picked up the song again.</p><p>
<em>What a wicked game to play to make me feel this way.</em>
</p><p>
<em>What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.</em>
</p><p>Her hand curled tighter around the mic stand, knuckles whitening. The edge of her voice frayed, not from pitch or strain, but something deeper - like the words themselves had to be wrung out of her.</p><p>
<em>What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way.</em>
</p><p>
<em>What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you.</em>
</p><p>Agatha's chest ached.</p><p>This time, Rio didn't stay quiet during the chorus.</p><p>But she didn't sing the lead line, either.</p><p>No, she settled for the backing vocals.</p><p>
<em>This world is only gonna break your heart.</em>
</p><p>Agatha watched Rio navigate the last verses like a tightrope walker, balancing between the words and choosing which way to lean.</p><p>Not once did she sing the main lyrics.</p><p><em>I don't wanna fall in love. With you</em>.</p><p>They were there, floating across the screen as if they wanted to remind everyone they'd been omitted.</p><p>Purposefully, Agatha had no doubt.</p><p>But <em>why</em>?</p><p>When the final note fell away, silence followed. Not the stunned kind, but softer, indulgent, like everyone was just coming out of a shared dream.</p><p>Then someone whistled, loud and piercing, waking the audience from stupor. A ripple of cheers spread through the crowd, scattered and half-distracted but warm enough to be convincing.</p><p>Rio stepped back from the mic, gave an exaggerated bow that made a few people laugh, and then turned to the crowd with a lopsided grin.</p><p>"Romantic, right?" she asked dryly, her voice raspy from the song. "Figured I'd serenade my wife with something wildly depressing to keep the spark alive. Also, Carol, you owe me twenty bucks for this."</p><p>Laughter bubbled in the room, the tension cracking just enough to give everyone permission to stop wondering what it all meant.</p><p>She stepped off the stage, hand outstretched toward Carol, who glowered as she pushed the bills into her palm. "No fair!" she groaned, loud enough for everyone to hear. "You picked a bare minimum song. There's hardly any lyrics in it, and you didn't sing half of 'em!"</p><p>The laughter got louder, shouts of agreement breaking through.</p><p>But Agatha didn't agree.</p><p>The choice wasn't the bare minimum. It wasn't to make easy money. The lyrics, omitted or not, carried weight.</p><p>There was a message in them, and as Rio approached her - flushed, smiling, and still playing the part - Agatha stared at her like she could see that message in her eyes.</p><p>She couldn't.</p><p>She didn't have the time to because the moment Rio reached her, she leaned in, pressing a kiss near the corner of her mouth.</p><p>"Just smile," she murmured, breath ghosting against her skin.</p><p>Agatha stood frozen, but her lips stretched obediently as if pulled by an invisible string. The warmth hitting her cheek smelled faintly of alcohol and cigarettes, making her realize that while she'd been spiraling outside, Rio must have joined the cluster of smokers for a drag.</p><p>"What are you doing?" she whispered shakily, feeling Rio's hands graze her waist again, not holding but hovering just above like she was an actress reluctant to touch her costar.</p><p>Rio pulled back enough to meet Agatha's eye. Her smile was wide and closed off, her expression unreadable.</p><p>"What do you think?" she asked softly, just loud enough for Agatha to hear over the fading laughter. "We're back on script, right?"</p><p>Agatha didn't respond. She didn't have to: the question was rhetorical, but it stung nonetheless.</p><p>"I'm making tonight count," Rio added. "Wouldn't want you suffering through it for nothing."</p><p>Her hands still hovered above Agatha's waist, suspended like she feared what the contact might do to them.</p><p>Then she leaned in again, and for a moment - a brief, fleeting second - Agatha thought Rio might kiss her. A real kiss. Not the one designed for the crowd, convincing only if viewed at a certain angle, but an actual press of lips.</p><p>Their breaths tangled. Rio's gaze dropped to her mouth, then rose again, slow and deliberate.</p><p>"Now," Rio whispered, her smirk not matching the steady, low tone. "Laugh like I said something funny and push me away."</p><p>Agatha's breath caught. The moment teetered on the edge of something she couldn't name, its weight pressing down on her chest like a warning. Or maybe a plea.</p><p>Laugh like I said something funny.</p><p>Push me away.</p><p>The words were part of the act. A cue. Just like the kiss near her mouth, the song, and everything else that existed between them.</p><p>Everything but the ache in Rio's eyes matched the script.</p><p>Agatha let out a soft, breathy laugh that sounded strained even to her own ears and pressed her hand to Rio's shoulder, gently nudging her back like a woman amused by her wife's shenanigans. The movement drew another round of amused glances from the crowd, glances she hadn't registered before, adding another layer of believability to the lie they were weaving.</p><p>Rio took the hint and stepped away, arms raised playfully, her smile bright and easy.</p><p>From the outside, they looked every bit the couple the room wanted them to be: flushed with intimacy, cloaked in shared secrets, and dripping with chemistry.</p><p>But inside, Agatha felt split down the middle.</p><p>She could no longer differentiate between real and fake.</p><hr/><p>The party turned into a blur of increasingly drunk faces and booming music, the night stretching long and loud as she and Rio navigated different crowds.</p><p>They steered clear of the dancefloor like the crush of bodies might swallow them whole. When they crossed it, it was only out of necessity - a path to the bar, the door, another round, another smoke. Never to dance, though. Never to risk touching without reason.</p><p>Not that it would even be possible because Rio made sure they were never alone.</p><p>Whenever the crowd around them thinned or the conversation lulled, she would pivot, either by drawing someone else into their orbit or steering them toward another group.</p><p>Agatha noticed.</p><p>She noticed how Rio's laughter always spiked just as silence crept in, how her hand would gesture too widely, catching someone's attention like a worm on a fishing hook. Rio kept them on a slow, deliberate loop around the party - just two people in a happy little orbit with enough satellites around them to make sure they didn't drift too close to each other.</p><p>She didn't ask for space. She just made sure it never existed.</p><p>And Agatha tried to tell herself it was fine. That she had <em>asked </em>for this.</p><p>After all, she was the one who had needed the line redrawn - less to keep Rio out than to keep herself in check.</p><p>But it didn't feel like peacekeeping.</p><p>It felt like exile, a subtle rejection delivered in practiced, feather-like touches carefully stripped of warmth. It was her own fucking words thrown back at her.</p><p>And still, she kept thinking about the song.</p><p>She hadn't realized how much it would haunt her until they were laughing with someone else, and the melody echoed in the back of her mind like a ghost she couldn't get rid of.</p><p>
<em>What a wicked game to play...</em>
</p><p>She thought about the chorus, about how it rolled by like it didn't matter. Rio had skipped the whole damn thing, and still, that had been the part that hit Agatha the hardest.</p><p>
<em>I don't wanna fall in love. With you.</em>
</p><p>Was that the truth Rio hadn't claimed because of the audience? Or the lie she hadn't wanted to tell?</p><p>Agatha didn't know. And it terrified her how badly she wanted to ask.</p><p>But Rio never gave her the chance. Not with words. Not even with a glance. She made sure Agatha was never close enough to try.</p><p>It was all for show. That's what Agatha kept telling herself, the same way she'd rehearsed every reason why this arrangement made sense.</p><p>Besides, Rio was tipsy, if not outright drunk. Her movements had that soft lag that came after one drink too many, and her eyes were slightly glazed over. Still sharp enough to know when they shifted away, though.</p><p>It wouldn't be fair to ask. Not with Rio incapacitated in some way.</p><p>The excuse was as good as any. Agatha could've also reasoned that there was a good chance Rio wouldn't remember the conversation in the morning. She could've decided that it was the kind of discussion that should be held in a private space.</p><p>But deep down, she knew it wasn't any of that. Well, at least not <em>only</em> that.</p><p>The truth was that she didn't want to hear the answer.</p><p>Whatever it might have been.</p><p>Fingers snapped in front of her, Jen's face coming into focus. "I know the singing's a cry for help, but disassociating's a bit much, don't you think?"</p><p>Agatha batted the hand away, frowning. "Fuck off, Jen," she growled, picking up her glass of water from the table.</p><p>They were back in the booth where she'd talked to Natasha, with a poor rendition of <em>Can't Help Falling in Love</em> filling the room. Honestly, Elvis had to be turning in his grave.</p><p>"Jesus, one would think being married would've taken the stick out of your ass," Jen grumbled.</p><p>Either her and Rio's acting was so superb they'd made Jen forget the marriage was fake, or the woman was too drunk to keep the facts straight.</p><p>Whatever it was, it pissed Agatha off. "One would also think having a girlfriend would've made you less of a bitch," she fired back without missing a beat.</p><p>Alice raised her hand before Jen could find a retort. "We were just saying," she started, sending her girlfriend a pointed look, "that Rio looks ready to go home."</p><p>Agatha frowned, glancing at the woman beside her.</p><p>Rio was sprawled on the leather seat, looking seconds away from melting into the upholstery. Her muscles were loose, her hair messy, and her neck was tilted at an awkward angle, eyes glued to the words sliding across the screen as the girl on stage disrespected Elvis with her pitchy squealing.</p><p>From the subtle movement of her lips, Agatha could tell she was absentmindedly mouthing the lyrics.</p><p>It wasn't deliberate, or at least it didn't look that way. There was no effort or sense of performance from earlier in it. Just the slow, tired formation of words under her breath, almost like a prayer.</p><p>Agatha studied her in silence.</p><p>The flush in her cheeks from the alcohol. The way her hand rested palm-up on the seat between them, limp and open like she'd forgotten to pull it back. The faint crease between her brows that hadn't smoothed since she'd stepped off that stage.</p><p>She looked undone. Unguarded, like the weight of pretending had finally caught up, and her body buckled under it.</p><p>Then her eyes fell away from the screen, and the music slowly faded into silence. Elvis' torture was over.</p><p>But not Agatha's.</p><p>"I'm right here, you know," Rio grumbled, not making any effort to sit up straighter or fix the hair falling over her face. "Having the time of my life."</p><p>"You're half-asleep," Alice deadpanned, hand sliding into Jen's like it belonged there. Well, it did, in a sense. "And we're gonna start telling people to leave anyway. We have <em>plans</em>."</p><p>Rio groaned at the innuendo but hoisted herself up. "I don't have to know about that."</p><p>Agatha nodded, following her. "Yeah, I don't want to hear about it either."</p><p>Jen looked between them, a dangerous smirk forming on her lips. "You know, maybe if you two just-"</p><p>"Do you want to go through with our plans?" Alice interrupted her with another pointed look. Jen nodded enthusiastically without missing a beat. "Then stop talking."</p><p>Agatha could've laughed at how fast Jen's mouth snapped closed. It seemed that her friend had found her match.</p><p>Before she could comment, Alice turned to her. "Thanks for the gift again. Get her home safe."</p><p>Agatha gave a shallow nod, her gaze already drifting back to Rio.</p><p>She was upright now, steadier than Agatha anticipated. Her movements were slightly off-balance, but her chin was lifted, and her lips stretched into something that could pass for a smirk. She'd pulled the performance back on like a second skin.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, wrapping an arm around her waist without asking. Rio didn't resist, but she didn't lean in, either. Just let it happen, like she was too tired to care.</p><p>"Thank you for having me," Agatha muttered, her voice quieter than she'd meant.</p><p>Alice didn't answer. She just gave a short nod, already pulling Jen out of the booth with the urgency of someone who had a much better place to be.</p><p>As they left the room, Agatha adjusted her hold, steadying Rio against her side.</p><p>"I'm not that drunk," Rio muttered even as she let Agatha guide her.</p><p>And she wasn't.</p><p>Her drinking had visibly slowed down after she'd stepped off the stage. The hastily downed shots had been replaced by slowly sipped cocktails, almost like she'd thought better about being blackout drunk by the end of the night. She'd stopped altogether about an hour ago, nursing a glass of water from the bar.</p><p>"I know," Agatha replied without removing her hands.</p><p>Rio didn't comment.</p><p>The party had dulled, with only a handful of people still trying to keep it alive by swaying drunkenly on the dancefloor. The music was quieter, too, like somebody had turned the dial down in a subtle attempt at discouraging the guests from prolonging the night. Agatha led them through the space, scanning the unfamiliar faces. Most of Rio's friends had already bid them goodbye, and Rio didn't seem interested in interacting with the remaining crowd.</p><p>Once they'd stepped out, they caught sight of Natasha and her sister - Yelena, if Agatha remembered correctly - leaning against the wall.</p><p>"Leaving already?" Natasha asked, smoke billowing out of her mouth in a whirly cloud. It took Agatha one whiff to realize it wasn't a cigarette.</p><p>"Alice essentially threw us out," Rio shrugged, detaching herself from Agatha. "Got a regular one?"</p><p>Yelena - or maybe Elena, whatever - fished a pack out of her pocket and tossed it to Rio, who, by some miracle, caught it. "Help yourselves."</p><p>Agatha swallowed a sigh, realizing their escape wouldn't be as smooth as she'd hoped, but accepted the cigarette Rio offered and let her light it.</p><p>The smoke scratched down her throat and filled her lungs in a wave, making her close her eyes in momentary bliss. She'd quit smoking after getting pregnant and rarely indulged in it, but she figured she deserved a cigarette after sitting through the party sober.</p><p>They stood silently for a beat, the space between them filled with puffs of smoke and the soft thrum of music filtering through the walls. Eventually, Natasha spoke again.</p><p>"You two put on a good show in there."</p><p>Agatha's chest tightened, but she kept her face smooth, exhaling smoke through her nose. She knew Natasha meant it as a compliment, a casual observation. But it rang too loudly in her ears.</p><p>"I mean it," Natasha went on. "I was seconds away from pulling out my lighter during the karaoke number."</p><p>Yelena - definitely Yelena, Agatha was sure now - snorted and tipped her head toward the oldest woman. "You should've done a duet. The chemistry would've been insane," she took another drag, humming in thought. "Like <em>Shallow</em> or some shit."</p><p>Natasha shook her head, plucking the blunt from between her fingers. "Nah, Rio doesn't have the voice for that. They would've killed <em>You're The One That I Want</em>, though."</p><p>Agatha inhaled the smoke again, willing the cigarette to burn faster. The last thing she needed was to imagine Rio in a Danny Zuko get-up. Or in Sandy's leather pants.</p><p>"In case you haven't noticed, we're not taking recommendations," Rio deadpanned, leaning her shoulder against the wall. "Besides, if I had to choose, I'd go with <em>Exile</em>."</p><p>Yelena cackled. "Jesus, that's bleak."</p><p>"Bleak but accurate," Rio muttered, eyes unfocused like she wasn't entirely with them.</p><p>Agatha didn't know if Rio meant the lyrics or the metaphor - two voices circling each other, never quite meeting. Either way, it hit too close to home. She flicked the ash off the tip of her cigarette, refusing to look how she felt.</p><p>"And who'd take which part?"</p><p>Rio's mouth quirked, but there was no humor in it.</p><p>"You think I'd let you have Bov Iver?" she asked, smoke curling from her lips like punctuation. "Please. You're Taylor in this scenario."</p><p>Natasha let out a low whistle, grinning around the blunt. "Okay, now I <em>really</em> want to see that duet."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and took another drag, the smoke now less of a comfort and more like a shield. "Well, too bad I'm never stepping foot on stage."</p><p>"You're just saying that." Yelena waved her off, stealing the blunt from Natasha for the last hit. "Next time, we'll get you so drunk you'll be dying to sing with Rio."</p><p>Next time.</p><p>Like Agatha was a permanent fixture in their lives now. In <em>Rio's</em> life.</p><p>"I think the amount of alcohol it would take borders on a lethal dosage," Rio commented, eyes on an approaching car. "That your ride?"</p><p>"Fucking finally, we ordered it like fifteen minutes ago," Yelena groaned, dropping the bud and crushing it beneath the toe of her boot. Rio handed her the half-finished pack and the lighter.</p><p>"Thanks for the smoke."</p><p>"Anytime," Yelena said easily, pocketing the items and offering a lazy wave. "See ya."</p><p>Natasha pushed off the wall, watching her sister head for the car before nodding at them. "It was nice meeting you, Agatha. Think about the duet idea. The show must go on, after all."</p><p>"Not likely, but it was nice meeting you, too," Agatha replied, mustering a smile that she hoped looked less tired than it felt.</p><p>"We'll get your wife to convince you," Natasha laughed, winking at her friend. "Later, Rio."</p><p>"Bye," Rio said casually, the word escaping her mouth with smoke.</p><p>They watched the car pull away, its headlights shrinking until the street darkened again. Agatha let her cigarette burn down between her fingers, more ember than filter now. She turned to ask if Rio was ready to go, but the words stalled in her throat.</p><p>Across the street, in the same spot she'd noticed earlier, stood the man.</p><p>Same all-black outfit and unassuming posture. Phone in hand, gaze drifting - not <em>at</em> them, not exactly - but his body was angled toward the bar too intentionally. Like he'd chosen that pocket of shadow for the way it cloaked him while still offering a clear line of sight.</p><p>Agatha's stomach tightened. Her first instinct was to look away, her heart ticking faster as her brain cycled through possibilities. Retaliation from a case? A pissed-off ex-client? Hired muscle with a grudge?</p><p>Her car was parked on the same side of the street. Close to him. <em>Too close</em>. If she grabbed Rio's hand and made a break for it, would Rio even follow without an explanation? Would it draw more attention?</p><p>Another glance. A passing car threw its headlights across the street for a brief second, dispersing the shadows long enough for Agatha to recognize the man.</p><p>Not a hitman. Worse, in some ways.</p><p>A private investigator.</p><p>She exhaled through her nose, sharp and cold.</p><p>She'd seen him before at legal mixers, during settlement conferences, once trailing a hedge fund exec she'd buried in court. He was good at his job. Quiet, thorough, and expensive.</p><p>Only one person came to mind with the money, motive, and spite to fund surveillance: her mother.</p><p>Agatha put the cigarette out against the wall, flicking it away with more force than necessary.</p><p>Of course, Evanora had sent someone to confirm the marriage. Of course, she'd had them followed. She probably expected photos. Footage. Proof.</p><p>The thought wasn't as rewarding as Agatha had expected it to be. Their acting had been impeccable; Evanora couldn't twist the obtained photos or recordings into evidence against them, even if the man had somehow entered the party.</p><p>Still, the PI was just another reminder that it was all the night could be called: an act.</p><p>"You know," Rio said, voice low and unbothered, dragging Agatha back to the present, "as my wife, you should probably know I'm against littering."</p><p>Agatha turned slightly. Rio didn't look at her, just nodded at the cigarette on the ground. "Especially when the trash can's right there."</p><p>A beat passed.</p><p>"Duly noted," Agatha murmured, brushing the ash from her fingertips.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. "You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."</p><p>Agatha didn't answer immediately. Her eyes flicked past Rio again toward the figure across the street.</p><p>"There's a guy in black on the other side of the street," she said quietly, voice barely above the thrum of passing cars. "Don't look."</p><p>Rio frowned but listened, keeping her eyes on Agatha. "Axe-murderer or a creep?"</p><p>"Worse. PI," Agatha said. "I saw him when I went out to text Wanda. He's good from what I know."</p><p>Rio's jaw tightened. "Your mother?"</p><p>"Definitely. And she wants us to know. Otherwise, we wouldn't have seen him."</p><p>"Why? That doesn't make sense."</p><p>"She's sending a message," Agatha leaned in a fraction closer. The passing cars offered enough noise to drown out their conversation, but she'd rather be safe than sorry. "It's a power play. Just another of her mind games. Knowing they're being watched makes people sloppy. If we try too hard, she might twist it into leverage."</p><p>"Jesus," Rio breathed. "Tell me we gave him good material."</p><p>Agatha offered a joyless smile. "We gave him exactly what my mother didn't want to see."</p><p>They stood quiet for a beat, the weight of the realization settling between them like fog. Agatha watched Rio wrestle with it, her expression darkening by degrees. The muscles in her jaw ticked. Her eyes narrowed at the man across the street with a kind of cold fury Agatha had only seen once.</p><p>It wasn't about the PI. It wasn't even about being watched.</p><p>It was about Evanora.</p><p>Agatha could feel it in the silence between them. Rio's disgust wasn't vague or passive but deeply personal. The kind that said <em>How dare she.</em> How dare Evanora reduce Agatha to a subject of scrutiny. How dare she pay someone to have her daughter followed. How dare she make something already complicated feel contaminated.</p><p>And for a moment, Agatha saw it - how much Rio hated her mother. Not with detachment but with seething, unforgiving fire.</p><p>It made something hollow in Agatha's chest clench. She didn't know what to do with it - what to say to acknowledge it - so she reached for the only thing that came naturally.</p><p>Her hand rose slowly, fingers brushing gently through Rio's hair to smooth a few wind-blown strands behind her ear. The touch lingered a second too long, and Agatha tried not to think about how natural it felt or how Rio leaned into it ever so slightly, like she wasn't even aware she was doing it.</p><p>Rio's eyes flicked toward the PI, then back to Agatha. Her voice dropped.</p><p>"Guess we're giving him a finale."</p><p>Agatha let her hand fall to her side. "I didn't do it for the camera."</p><p>Rio's mouth quirked - half a smirk, half something else entirely. "Yeah," she murmured, eyes locked on Agatha's like they were the only two people left on the street. "I know."</p><p>For a heartbeat, neither of them moved. The air between them was sharp with smoke, silence, and something too fragile to name.</p><p>Then Rio took a step back, nodding toward the car. "Come on, wifey. Let's get out of the spotlight."</p><p>Agatha followed without a word, her pulse louder than the click of her heels on the pavement. She didn't glance back at the man across the street. She didn't have to.</p><p>They'd already given him an ending.</p><p>Whether or not it was real, well, that was no longer just his question.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The next morning, Agatha kicked back the covers with a reluctant sigh, surrendering any remaining hope of stealing another hour of sleep. It was 7 AM, and she'd already spent the last two hours tangled in the sheets, turning over every few minutes like sleep might finally find her if she could just get the angle right.</p><p>No luck.</p><p>It was one of those rare Sundays she didn't have to spend on the bleachers of some run-down, underfunded soccer pitch, pretending the rules weren't made up and the parents around her weren't annoying. She needed rest, deserved it, after staying out so late.</p><p>But her mind had other plans.</p><p>It had replayed the party on a loop, dissecting it frame by frame like some courtroom cross-examination: from the moment she'd stepped out of her bedroom to the moment she'd reentered hours later, post-Rio. Everything in between. Every word, every look, and every almost.</p><p>The drive back home had been peaceful, silent in a way that hadn't felt suffocating but comfortable. Rio had dozed off in the passenger seat, elbow tucked against the window, her hand loosely cupping her face like a shield. She'd shifted now and then, head lolling before she caught herself, but never fully waking.</p><p>Agatha had tried to focus on the road, but her gaze kept drifting, drawn to the way the harsh streetlights softened Rio's profile. All the sharp edges Rio wore like armor had melted away in the dark, and for once, she looked entirely at ease.</p><p>Agatha hadn't been able to stop staring.</p><p>And now, hours later, even in the still hush of her own bed, the memories refused to loosen their grip. Every spoken line and every exchanged touch slid before her eyelids to <em>Wicked Game</em> like some cruel commemorative video edited together by her traitorous mind.</p><p>Agatha sat up slowly, pushing her hands through her hair before scrubbing them down her face. The room was dim, the curtains drawn tight to keep out the sun, but her body felt the weight of daylight anyway. She swung her legs over the side of the bed and stared at the floor like it might give her permission to move.</p><p>The house was quiet, the way it had been since she'd pushed Rio away. Nicky's absence deepened the silence, making it echo in her chest with no footsteps thundering down the hall or impatient shouts to ward off the feeling. Her thoughts had room to breathe; too much if Agatha was being honest.</p><p>She moved on autopilot toward the kitchen, started the coffee, and leaned her hip against the counter while it brewed. The silence kept folding in on itself.</p><p>Rio's laugh - sharp, effortless - still echoed faintly in her ears in tune with the restrained voice that had followed their dance and that fucking song. The way she'd looked after the PI fiasco, all fire and fury and something dangerously close to care. The way her hair had fallen across her face, how naturally Agatha had reached out to fix it, how effortless it had felt to touch her.</p><p>The memories didn't form a mosaic - no, that would suggest cohesion, a deliberate beauty of fragments coming together to make something whole. This wasn't that. This was a scatter of glass shards, of jagged edges and mismatched colors, strewn across the floor of her mind. Some pieces glinted with the sharp, sudden brightness of laughter, of Rio's hand in hers or the warmth of her voice. Others were cloudy and cold, dulled by distance, poisoned with hesitation.</p><p>They weren't arranged. There was no pattern or meaning, just slivers of a night that refused to settle. Each one dug deeper the more she tried to walk through it, a minefield of sensations and unsaid things. Agatha couldn't step back far enough to make sense of the picture because there was none.</p><p>And even if there was, she couldn't see it, let alone understand it.</p><p>She poured herself a cup and stood at the sink, holding the warm ceramic close like it could anchor her. They'd played their parts perfectly. Her mother had surveillance, but not a shred of evidence. Technically, it was a win.</p><p>But victory felt hollow in her hands.</p><p>Agatha sipped the coffee, staring out the window at the garden. The two raised beds were lush with greenery. According to Rio the peppers and tomatoes would start showing soon, dotting the leaves with bursts of red and gold.</p><p>Agatha hadn't heard it from Rio herself. She'd only known because Nicky had come running inside, bubbling over with excitement as he passed along the update. His voice had echoed off the walls of the too-big kitchen, bright and bouncing, until he turned to share the moment with Rio, only to find her gone. She'd disappeared to her room after watering the plants, and Agatha had watched her boy's face fall a little. He gave the kind of sigh a child shouldn't know how to give, weary and automatic, like he'd stopped expecting her to stay.</p><p>He'd cut his story short after that, walking away mid-sentence. And Agatha had stood there, a clean plate she'd taken out of the dishwasher in hand, unsure who she was more furious with - Rio, for leaving, or herself, for making her.</p><p>She drew a breath, deeper than needed, and closed her eyes against the memory.</p><p>They couldn't keep functioning like this.</p><p>The thought settled on her shoulders like an old coat: too familiar and heavy. Their shared avoidance and strained coordination around keeping the house operational had been fractured from the beginning, and Agatha had hoped that time would patch the fracture or at least stop it from expanding.</p><p>But time didn't heal cracks. It only deepened them.</p><p>And the changed atmosphere could translate into tension in the outside world. The party had been proof. Yes, they'd performed relatively well, but how many more times could they pull it off? How many more evenings could they pretend to be effortless with the strain woven into their silences and the glances that lasted just a second too long?</p><p>They couldn't keep acting like strangers inside the house and expect to play spouses outside. The contradiction was untenable. It frayed the edges of the performance and made every shared scene feel brittle, one wrong word away from shattering.</p><p>And truthfully, the line she'd drawn weeks ago hadn't done what she thought it would. It hadn't created clarity or insulated them from confusion. If anything, it had destabilized the entire agreement. It had made everything colder and less convincing, eroding the deal instead of protecting it.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, her fingers curling around the warmth of the mug. Redrawing the line had hurt more than it had helped. It had hurt the deal. It had hurt <em>her</em>.</p><p>And for what?</p><p>She thought of the party. Rio had seemed to genuinely enjoy her company, at least before Agatha had thrown a grenade into the middle of whatever brittle truce they'd built for the night. But the beginning hadn't felt like a performance, not entirely. That ease between them, the familiar rhythm of light sarcasm and exchanged looks, had come back without resistance, as if their dynamic had only been lying in wait, hoping for an opening.</p><p>Agatha didn't let herself dwell on what that meant. Rio had never given her a reason to believe her feelings were mutual, and the point of the boundary had been to remind herself that this was a deal, not a relationship. And yet, all it had done was make everything worse.</p><p>She drew in a breath, steady and sure this time. The lines had undermined their credibility, and with the PI following them, the erosion was dangerous.</p><p>So maybe it was time to stop treating distance like a safeguard.</p><p>The space she'd put between them hadn't dulled the ache in her chest; it transformed it into something sharper and more persistent. And if the lines hadn't helped, what was the point of keeping them, at least in the same capacity?</p><p>She and Rio could be close, not romantically or biblically, but as <em>friends</em>. They could return to the easy rhythm they'd built in the house before everything calcified. It would make Nicky happy - she could already see him lighting up at the shift, treating every half-joke like proof his world wasn't splitting at the seams. It would make Agatha less miserable. Or at least make the silence less oppressive.</p><p>The ache wasn't going anywhere. She'd come to terms with that sometime between 5 and 6 AM when it had settled in her ribs and refused to budge. But that was fine. She was good at letting things live in the background. She knew how to leave her feelings on mute.</p><p>This wasn't about erasing anything but rewriting the terms again, this time with something more sustainable. Distance hadn't protected her. It had built a wall too high to climb over when they needed to look like a team.</p><p>So, she'd climb down instead.</p><p>She put the empty cup in the dishwasher and glanced at the garden again, remembering Rio's words from the gala.</p><p>
<em>Not everything thrives on distance.</em>
</p><p>She'd been right. The deal couldn't survive if the distance remained.</p><p>And what harm could bridging the gap a little do?</p><hr/><p>Agatha dragged her feet as she moved through the motions of getting ready, her pace deliberately slow. Her eyes flicked toward the hallway more times than she could count, each glance a silent wish. She hoped Rio would appear - messy-haired and barefoot, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes as she navigated the house on autopilot to reach her first coffee of the day. It would give Agatha a reason to pause, to talk about the shift she'd already committed to hours before.</p><p>But the house remained quiet.</p><p>Sunday silence was a ritual even before everything had changed. With as little spare time as Rio had, she made lazy Sundays count, rarely emerging from her room before noon, usually just before Agatha and Nicky returned from his games.</p><p>This morning was no different. There were no footsteps in the hall or muted music bleeding from under her door. She was probably still fast asleep.</p><p>By the time 10 AM rolled around, Agatha was perched at the edge of her bed, phone in hand. Her screen lit up with a third "you coming or not??" text from Wanda, and she rolled her eyes. The talk would have to wait.</p><p>She sighed, shoved the phone into her pocket, and grabbed her bag.</p><p>The drive to Wanda's was short, made even shorter by the radio humming beneath her thoughts. She'd put it on instinctively, hoping the background noise would help her ignore the growing knot of nerves twisting in her stomach. It didn't. Her mind was a courtroom, and Rio was a case she couldn't stop preparing for. She rehearsed every version of the conversation they hadn't had, shaping it like a strategy. She imagined Rio's responses, the tilt of her head, the tone of her voice, and restructured her points accordingly.</p><p>When she pulled into Wanda's driveway, the silence around the house felt suspicious. With two boys under twelve - one of whom treated the idea of calm as a personal insult - quiet was not only rare but unnatural. Agatha braced herself.</p><p>She pushed the front door open without knocking, greeted not by chaos, but a distant voice.</p><p>"In the kitchen!"</p><p>Agatha kicked off her shoes and made her way down the hall, guided by a thin trail of music and the smell of freshly baked goods. She turned the corner to find Wanda elbow-deep in what looked like brownie batter, her wooden spoon moving with exaggerated frustration.</p><p>"I was starting to wonder if I should get adoption papers in order," Wanda said without looking up.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, shaking her bag off her shoulder and sinking onto a stool. "You should get a hand mixer instead. Or, I don't know, one of those countertop ones that does all the work while you drink wine and supervise."</p><p>"Where's the fun in that?" Wanda replied dryly, wiping her brow with the back of her wrist like she was working in a bakery that paid by the ounce of sweat. "Manual labor keeps me humble."</p><p>Agatha gave the bowl a dubious look. "Where's everyone? I was expecting a Nerf war or a soccer ball flying at my head."</p><p>"Vis took them to the park," Wanda replied, scraping the spoon against the bowl to get the batter out. "My theory is they're so conditioned to spend Sundays burning off energy that when there's no game, they turn feral. It was either let them loose at the park or risk seeing my furniture on fire."</p><p>Agatha snorted, resting her elbows on the counter and leaning into them. "And to think, you were talking about adopting a third."</p><p>"I am a really good best friend," Wanda said, finally looking at her. "And Nicky's basically my third. I'm his godmother, he has a favorite mug here, and I know his snack preferences better than my husband's. At this point, I might as well start claiming him on my taxes."</p><p>Agatha's smirk softened into something fond. "He was really excited to sleep over last night."</p><p>"I noticed," Wanda said, her tone growing gentle as she turned to put the brownies in the oven. "He jumped at the idea of setting the table, and couldn't stop beaming when we sat down to eat."</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek, knowing where his excitement had stemmed from. "I think he needed a break from... everything."</p><p>"We all do sometimes," Wanda noticed, slamming the oven shut with the kind of force that doubled as punctuation. She moved to the sink and rinsed her hands, the sound of running water briefly filling the silence.</p><p>After a beat, she grabbed a towel, tossed it half-heartedly onto the counter, and leaned one hip against the stove, eyes narrowing with interest. "So, how was the party?"</p><p>"Wasn't there supposed to be coffee?"</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes like Agatha had just asked for room service, but she turned to the pot. She poured two cups and slid one across the counter with an exaggerated sigh, then folded her arms and fixed Agatha with the expectant stare of someone who'd cleared her morning exclusively for gossip.</p><p>But Agatha wasn't ready, at least for the Rio part. So she pivoted.</p><p>"Alice brought a date, and you won't believe who it was," she said casually, wrapping both hands around the warm mug.</p><p>Wanda squinted, her brows knitting together. "I mean, I don't even know Alice. What's it to me who she's dating?"</p><p>"Oh, trust me. You'll want to hear this."</p><p>Wanda looked skeptical but leaned in anyway. "Hit me."</p><p>Agatha paused just long enough for dramatic effect, then dropped the name like a lit match.</p><p>"Jen."</p><p>There was a beat of silence, then Wanda blinked. "Wait, <em>your</em> Jen?"</p><p>Agatha made a disgusted face at that. "Don't call her mine."</p><p>Wanda waved the comment off. "How did they even meet? Through you and Rio?"</p><p>"At the bar. Alice works there too."</p><p>"Jesus," Wanda giggled, shaking her head. "The owner should put up a banner advertising that place as a matchmaking service."</p><p>"I think they're out of single bartenders," Agatha deadpanned, deciding not to comment on how she and Rio had an entirely different relationship than Alice and Jen.</p><p>If she could even call whatever was between them a relationship.</p><p>"You should've seen Jen, though," she added. "One look from Alice and she shut right up. I think I'll start inviting her to partner meetings."</p><p>Wanda snorted into her coffee, nearly spilling it. "Honestly, I think Lilia would get on board with that. She'd probably invite Rio as well. For the <em>drama</em>."</p><p>Agatha gave her a sharp look. "That was subtle."</p><p>"You mean my seamless segue?" Wanda batted her lashes, then reached for a plate stacked high with brownies and slid it onto the island between them. "You gave me the appetizer. Now I want the main course."</p><p>"Seems like you skipped straight to dessert," Agatha said dryly, reaching for a brownie only for Wanda to slap her hand away with impressive speed. "What the fuck?"</p><p>"Only talkers get treats," Wanda sang-songed, pulling the plate closer to her side like she was guarding state secrets.</p><p>Agatha scowled. "I'm not a child."</p><p>"You're acting like one." Wanda's expression softened, just enough to undercut the teasing. "C'mon, something's clearly bothering you. Talking about it may not fix it, but it'll help take the edge off. And you look like you've been carrying around a damn sword."</p><p>Agatha didn't answer immediately, her hand curling around her mug again. She stared into the coffee like it might help find the right words, but all it did was reflect her own tired eyes.</p><p>Finally, she sighed, barely loud enough to hear over the soft music. "I fucked up with the distancing thing."</p><p>Wanda raised her brows in mild surprise, and Agatha couldn't blame her. Admitting she'd been wrong was right next to being burned at the stake in her book, but she couldn't pretend that her solution to the ache in her chest had been a good one anymore.</p><p>"Did something happen at the party?"</p><p>"Yes and no." Agatha let her thumb trail the rim of her mug, chewing on her lower lip. "We put on a good show, even got a few compliments about how natural we looked. It was a success."</p><p>"But?" Wanda prodded gently.</p><p>"There was an undercurrent in everything," she sighed again. "Every word, every touch. Nobody else saw. I think. But... how long can we live like this? Avoiding each other at home, then playing perfect in public?"</p><p>Wanda leaned against the counter, studying her. "You said you pulled it off."</p><p>"Because the audience was a bunch of unsuspecting twenty-somethings too interested in the open bar to pay attention," Agatha drummed her fingers against the mug in tune with the soft pop song playing in the background. "A PI will be harder to fool, especially the one my mother hired. He's good."</p><p>Wanda blinked at her, the words taking a second to land. "Wait - pause. Evanora hired a PI?"</p><p>Agatha scoffed, waving her hand as if brushing the absurdity away. "You're saying that like you're surprised. It was only a matter of time."</p><p>"That's... <em>insane</em>, Agatha. It's a massive breach of privacy. Doesn't it bother you?"</p><p>Agatha wanted to say yes. That it felt like a betrayal, a boundary obliterated. That her mother's endless need for control and proof made her feel more like a suspect than a daughter. But the truth was, she'd built her expectations around Evanora's manipulations a long time ago. There was no room left inside her to be surprised.</p><p>Besides, the marriage <em>was</em> a sham. For once, Evanora had some actual reason to treat her like a notorious liar.</p><p>"It was inevitable," she said instead, voice flat. "And now that it's happened, the only way to shut her up is to make the marriage look airtight. No cracks. No distance."</p><p>Wanda didn't respond right away. Her frown deepened, but not with confusion - more like concern. Like she was watching someone patch a leaking dam with their bare hands and pretending it would hold.</p><p>"So, just to make sure we're on the same page," she said slowly, setting her cup down with a soft clink. "Your mother hires someone to trail you like you're a suspect in a crime drama, and your takeaway is that your fake marriage has to be more convincing?"</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her stool, feeling the edge of exhaustion in her spine. The few measly hours of sleep hadn't prepared her for this conversation well enough. "What else am I supposed to take away from it?"</p><p>"That your mother's obsession with control is pathological?"</p><p>Agatha snorted, waving her hand. "Wands, that's old news. She's been controlling my entire life. At least this time, she has a reason to follow my every move. A few million reasons, even."</p><p>Wanda scrunched her eyebrows, visibly struggling not to argue. Then, she exhaled slowly, the disdain in her eyes ebbing from a wildfire to a mild spark.</p><p>"I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Evanora's a raging bitch," she grumbled, pushing the brownies back into Agatha's reach like she'd finally earned it. "So. The marriage has to be perfect. What's your plan?"</p><p>Agatha picked at one of the pieces, studying the dense texture and the half-melted chocolate like she was a judge in a baking contest. "I have to stop making it harder. Pulling away was a miscalculation. It made the whole arrangement feel like it would crack under pressure."</p><p>"And Rio?" Wanda asked carefully.</p><p>A long beat paused.</p><p>"I think I hurt her," Agatha admitted, the words tasting foreign on her tongue.</p><p>Wanda looked at her like she'd just stated the grass was green. "Yeah. No shit."</p><p>Agatha turned the brownie in her hands, the chocolate staining her fingers. "She's good, you know? The kind of person who makes room for people without even thinking about it, who shows up without being asked to. And I think I made her feel like she crossed a line just by being herself."</p><p>Wanda nodded slowly, giving her space.</p><p>"She didn't do anything wrong," Agatha pressed on, quieter now. "I did. I was the one who started seeing shadows where there weren't any. And when I put up the distance, I thought I was doing the responsible thing."</p><p>"But it froze her out instead," Wanda said, more observation than accusation.</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha whispered. "And it fucked everything up."</p><p>There was a beat of silence, broken only by the soft hum of the fridge and the faint crackle of music in the background.</p><p>"Ags," Wand said gently, reaching out and plucking the brownie from her hands like it was evidence. She replaced it with a tissue, pressing it into her palm. "Ignoring your feelings won't make them go away."</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth, focusing on wiping the chocolate off her fingers. Her eyes stung, but she refused to let the tears fall. "I know. I've been trying and it's not working. That's why I need a different approach."</p><p>Wanda hummed thoughtfully, something between understanding and stubborn disbelief. "You said the distance hurt Rio. Don't you think maybe that's because-"</p><p>"No." The word cut through the air like a blade. Agatha's head snapped up, eyes sharp with warning. "Don't go there."</p><p>"I'm just saying-"</p><p>"No, Wanda." It came out low and tight, the growl of someone trying not to break. "There's nothing there. Not on her side. And even if there were... we're not in a place where anything real could happen. We have too much riding on this. Feelings would complicate everything."</p><p>"Haven't they already?" Wanda countered, folding her arms. "You pulled your walls back up because of the feelings, and now you're saying it was a mistake."</p><p>"A mistake I will remedy," Agatha said, her expression tight. "Indifference isn't the answer, I know that now. So we can be friends. It will keep the deal solid, make Nicky happy, and hell, maybe her too."</p><p>"What about you? What would make <em>you</em> happy?"</p><p>
<em>Dropping the act. Building something that would hold. Being able to take the plunge without fear of drowning.</em>
</p><p>"Keeping the deal intact," she tossed the stained tissue aside, looking Wanda in the eye. "I've done harder things than swallowing my feelings. They're background noise by now."</p><p>They weren't. The pull toward Rio buzzed just beneath her skin like a current she couldn't find a switch for. But she didn't have to admit that.</p><p>Wanda pressed her lips together, visibly displeased with the outcome of the conversation. Then she sighed again, resignation softening her voice. "Alright."</p><p>But Agatha knew Wanda too well. That <em>alright</em> was just a marker in the sand. The conversation was postponed, but far from over.</p><p>"Did you talk to her after the party?" Wanda asked.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. "No. She was exhausted on the drive back. And I didn't catch her before I left," she waved her hand at the question in Wanda's eyes. "Which is normal. She's not a morning person."</p><p>"But you <em>are</em> going to talk to her," Wanda pressed on, staring Agatha down like she expected a blood pact or a pinky promise.</p><p>"Jesus, yeah, I will."</p><p>"Today."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, reaching for her now lukewarm coffee. "That's the plan."</p><p>Wanda didn't look convinced. "Your plans have the structural integrity of wet cardboard when it comes to Rio."</p><p>Agatha glared at her, but it lacked venom. "I'm serious."</p><p>"Good. Then be honest with her."</p><p>Agatha snorted. "Right. How does, 'Hey, sorry for pushing you away almost a month ago. I didn't expect it to hurt more than being close to you, and now I want to be your friend' sound?"</p><p>"Perfect," Wanda said without missing a beat. "You should lead with that."</p><p>Agatha stared down at her coffee again, swirling what was left like the dregs might offer her a glimpse into her future. The silence between her and Wanda had settled thick, but it was nothing compared to the one waiting for her at home. It was the first time she'd spoken those words aloud, and now they clung to her like smoke, flimsy and foolish. Rio didn't have any reason to meet her halfway, not after Agatha had essentially punished her for being herself. She'd drawn the line, then circled it in neon at the party, and now - what? She was hoping Rio would act like none of it mattered?</p><p>"Oh, no, no, no," Wanda's voice cut in, sharp and knowing, snapping Agatha out of her spiral. "I know what you're thinking."</p><p>"I very much doubt that," Agatha drawled.</p><p>Wanda raised her chin, undeterred. "You're thinking it's better to sit in this discomfort for a few more months than face her and risk getting hurt."</p><p>Okay. Close. Too close. Agatha had to give her that.</p><p>"I <em>am</em> facing it," she said, pushing her mug aside and sliding off the stool like movement might untangle the knot in her chest. "I told you - the deal won't survive if we're just cold housemates. We need to be... friendly. At least."</p><p>"But that's not why you're doing it," Wanda said slowly. "You don't want to just smooth things over for the sake of the arrangement. You want to be in her life in a way that's real and it's okay."</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, eyes on the floor like the truth might trip her. Her first instinct was to deny everything, maybe also tell Wanda to mind her own fucking business, but the words wouldn't form.</p><p>Instead, a broken question fell from her lips.</p><p>"And if she doesn't want that?"</p><p>
<em>If she doesn't want me even as a friend?</em>
</p><p>"Then she deserves a chance to say so," Wanda replied. "But you can't hide behind the pretense of the deal. You'd be surprised how far a little honesty can take you."</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Then, she yanked her phone out of her back pocket, opening the thread with Rio.</p><p>Agatha [12.14 PM]</p><p>
<em>Can we talk tonight? </em>
</p><p>She hit send, but her fingers hovered before forming another message.</p><p>Agatha [12.14 PM]</p><p>
<em>Not strictly about the deal, though. Just us.</em>
</p><p>There. No deletion. No backup plan.</p><p>Just the truth. Or at least a part of it.</p><p>Wanda nodded approvingly. "Look at you, using your grown-up words."</p><p>"Don't ruin it," Agatha muttered.</p><p>Wanda just smirked and slid another brownie her way.</p><hr/><p>Rio hadn't responded. She hadn't even read the texts.</p><p>And if the lack of her car in the garage was any indicator, she wasn't home when Agatha returned with Nicky's detailed retelling of his time at Wanda's in her ear.</p><p>Agatha tried not to let any of that send her into a spiral.</p><p>Because it didn't have to mean Rio was avoiding her. Or that she'd seen the message, rolled her eyes at the audacity, and slipped out just in time to avoid any awkward conversation.</p><p>It didn't have to mean that.</p><p>It could mean she was busy. Maybe it was something she'd planned long ago, like checking in on her friends to make sure no one from the party ended up with alcohol poisoning. Maybe she was running errands. Or grabbing takeout. Or doing literally anything that had nothing to do with Agatha and her sudden compulsion to face the consequences of her behavior.</p><p>Still, as she moved through the motions of the day - cooking dinner, playing a half-distracted game of checkers with Nicky, clearing a few urgent emails - her mind wouldn't stop drafting quiet, persistent worst-case scenarios. Each more dramatic than the last, a little harder to shake.</p><p>For once, though, the plants scattered around the house didn't feel like a passive-aggressive reminder of someone else's presence. They filled her with something closer to relief. Rio wouldn't abandon them to die at Agatha's hand. She probably wouldn't leave without her favorite pair of sneakers either, the ratty ones still sitting in the shoe rack, laces frayed, toes scruffed to hell, begging to be put out of their misery.</p><p>But it was the plants that anchored Agatha.</p><p>As she sank onto the couch beside Nicky and queued up <em>Big Hero 6 </em>for what had to be the hundredth time, her eyes drifted to the one by the TV. Heart-shaped leaves and trailing stems, seemingly longer than they had been a few months ago.</p><p>Rio had told her its name once, ages ago. She could almost hear the enthusiasm in her voice, the way she'd brightened when talking about <em>photosynthesis</em>, of all things. But Agatha hadn't listened. Not really. Back then, she'd looked at every pot like it was another proof that her life was out of her hands.</p><p>Now she wished she'd paid attention.</p><p>The opening notes of the movie filled the living room for what had to be the third time that month. Nicky was already reciting lines under his breath, sprawled across the couch with his feet digging into her thigh, when Agatha heard the door.</p><p>A key turned in the lock unhurriedly, familiarly. But her pulse jumped anyway.</p><p>She didn't move at first. Didn't want to seem like she'd spent the day <em>waiting</em>, even though that was exactly what she'd been doing since the moment she hit send. She smoothed her expression, eyes still fixed on the screen, as the door creaked open and footsteps padded in.</p><p>Rio stood in the doorway, sunglasses perched on the top of her head, a tote bag slung over her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha's heart did something indecisive in her chest, a sinking feeling followed by a flutter.</p><p>The fact that Rio had entered the room, or at least stopped to look inside, was a good sign. A few days ago, she would've gone straight to her bedroom.</p><p>"Hey," Rio said carefully. Her eyes flicked over them before stopping on the TV. "<em>Big Hero 6? </em>Again?"</p><p>Nicky perked up at the sound of her voice, twisting his neck to look at her over the armrest. "Rio! We have popcorn, c'mon!" he started moving, digging his feet further into Agatha's thigh to push away from her and make room for Rio in the middle.</p><p>Apparently, he was tired of being the buffer.</p><p>Rio smiled at him warmly. "Maybe some other time."</p><p>"I know it's not movie night, but you can stay," Nicky said quickly, turning to look at Agatha with a slight pout. "Right, Mama?"</p><p>Agatha swallowed. She didn't want to disappoint Nicky or make Rio feel unwelcome, but the thought of sitting side by side on that couch, pretending everything was fine for the next two hours, made her stomach twist.</p><p>She glanced at Rio, who was still standing in the doorway like the decision was hers to make. Not just about the movie, but about everything that had been left unsaid.</p><p>"I think," Agatha said carefully, straightening up in her seat and brushing a hand over Nicky's calf, "Rio and I need to talk first."</p><p>Nicky looked between them, reading something in her voice he couldn't quite name, but understood well enough to nod. "Okay," he said, plopping back down and grabbing the remote. "But I'm saving your seats."</p><p>Rio gave him a playful salute and stepped out of the room, eyes catching Agatha's in a silent message to follow. Agatha stood, heart hammering in her chest, as she followed her to the kitchen.</p><p>Rio set the tote on the counter and leaned against it, arms folding across her chest - not cold, exactly, but guarded.</p><p>Agatha hated that it felt earned.</p><p>"You didn't respond to my texts," she started, then immediately regretted how accusatory it sounded.</p><p>"I read them," Rio replied. "Figured we'd address them once I came back."</p><p>Agatha nodded, throat tight. She didn't ask where Rio had been. She didn't have the right to.</p><p>"I owe you an apology," she said. "For the party. For everything."</p><p>Rio's expression didn't shift, but her arms relaxed slightly, uncrossing just enough for her hands to press flat against the counter behind her. "That's a broad category."</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly. The bluntness landed like a blow.</p><p>"I shouldn't have pushed you away," she said, the words tumbling out of her mouth like a waterfall, quick and unstoppable as if saying them slower would make them too heavy to carry. "At the party. Before that. I thought keeping things professional - keeping <em>us</em> transactional - would make everything easier."</p><p>Rio didn't interrupt. Her expression stayed frozen, but something behind her eyes shifted. A crack in the ice, maybe. Or maybe Agatha was just desperate enough to see things that weren't there.</p><p>"But it didn't," Agatha went on, voice growing quieter. "It made everything harder. For me. For you. For Nicky."</p><p>She paused, her throat tightening as the words caught, suddenly fragile and bare. "My focus was on simplifying everything between us. Cutting out the complications, keeping things clean. I didn't expect you to care, or maybe I just didn't let myself believe you would, and that was foolish. I should've <em>asked</em> what you wanted. I should've given you a choice. But I didn't."</p><p>She looked up, eyes locking with Rio's. "And I'm sorry. That wasn't fair. Not to you. Not to... us."</p><p>Rio's jaw shifted slightly, a tell that Agatha had learned meant she was thinking about how much she was willing to give back.</p><p>"You said this wasn't about the deal. In your texts," Rio finally said, slow and deliberate. "I need you to tell me if it is. If this, whatever you're doing right now, is just damage control because you saw the PI and panicked."</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. "What?"</p><p>"I watch you, Agatha. Just as closely as you watch everyone else." Rio leaned forward, and the way her eyes drilled into Agatha's felt like punctuation. "I've seen the way you pull back, how you calculate your next move like everyone's a chess piece. And lately, it's felt like I was one of them."</p><p>Agatha's throat went dry. She opened her mouth, but Rio pressed on.</p><p>"We've spent weeks acting like strangers. The longest conversation we've had lately was about Alice's party, and even then, it was about optics. About the deal. Just another one of your moves."</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze, shame prickling at her skin.</p><p>"You've repeatedly told me this was transactional," Rio continued, her voice tight but steady. "And I won't pretend I ever made peace with that, but I learned to live with it. I gave you the space you clearly wanted. I pulled back from Nicky, even when he looked at me like I'd done something wrong, because it became obvious that you didn't want me in your life. Not outside the frame of a signed contract."</p><p>She paused, and Agatha forced herself to look up again. Rio wasn't crying, but her restraint was palpable. It was in the set of her jaw, the way she gripped the edge of the counter like she needed it to stay grounded.</p><p>"I've spent the last weeks existing in this house like a shadow," she said quietly. "Not gone or invisible, just... tolerated. Like something you couldn't get rid of but didn't want to look at, either."</p><p>Agatha's heart twisted, a dull ache blooming under her breastbone. She'd done that. She'd done it to protect herself from the softness she'd felt whenever Rio looked at her like she mattered. It wasn't malicious. It wasn't supposed to hurt either of them. But it did.</p><p>Rio let out a soft breath, eyes flicking to the doorway for a second before they returned to Agatha. "So if you're apologizing because you saw the PI and became worried about how it'll look, just say <em>that</em>. Say that, and I'll tell you that your coldness doesn't affect my ability to sell our lie, and we'll go back to the silence, the distance, and whatever else you need to make this simple for you."</p><p>The words settled in the room like dust, suffocating and impossible to ignore. Agatha opened her mouth, then closed it again. She knew whatever she said could make or break everything. Every syllable counted.</p><p>Her voice, when it finally came, was quiet but steady. "I won't lie to you."</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly not expecting that as the opening.</p><p>"The PI <em>is</em> an issue," Agatha continued. "He's a clear sign that we're under my mother's unforgiving scrutiny, and we cannot take that lightly. One wrong move could blow up everything we've created."</p><p>If she weren't staring at Rio so intensely, she might have missed the change in her expression. But she didn't, and as Rio's brown eyes darkened and her brows furrowed, she realized she'd made a mistake.</p><p>"Right," Rio drawled, pushing away from the counter, already half-turned to leave.</p><p>"No, wait," Agatha said quickly, stepping forward and reaching out.</p><p>Her fingers closed around Rio's wrist with enough pressure to say <em>Please don't go</em> without it feeling like an order. The contact was gentle, barely there, but it halted Rio mid-step like she'd walked into a wall.</p><p>Agatha could feel her pulse where their skin touched, fast and taut. Her own wasn't any calmer.</p><p>"Please," she said, softer now. "Let me finish."</p><p>Rio didn't turn around fully, but she stilled, the muscles in her arms jumping like she wasn't sure if she wanted to stay or bolt.</p><p>"I brought up the PI because his presence <em>is</em> a part of this," Agatha went on, voice steady despite the churning in her stomach. "But it's not why I texted you. He's not why I'm standing here trying to talk to you now."</p><p>A beat passed. Agatha let go of her wrist, hand dropping limply to her side.</p><p>"I'm doing this because I miss you," she admitted, getting closer to the truth than she'd like. But Rio deserved it. She deserved at least some semblance of it.</p><p>Rio stilled completely.</p><p>"I miss hearing the music fill every room you're in. I miss sitting at the table and listening to you and Nicky ramble about video games and using words I barely understand. I miss how easy it felt before I ruined it."</p><p>Rio turned slightly, her face unreadable, but her eyes softer, more open.</p><p>Agatha pressed on, each word feeling like it might give way beneath her. "I know I was the one who said it was just a deal, and I don't expect you to forget that. I wouldn't, if I were you. But I want to make space for something better. Something real."</p><p>Rio blinked, just once. Her face didn't change, but Agatha could feel the tension cracking under the surface, something unspoken rising between them like static.</p><p>"I want to be your friend," Agatha added almost shyly. "I- want your presence in my life to be about more than the inheritance and my mother."</p><p>Finally, Rio shifted to look at her properly, leaning one hand against the kitchen island like she needed something solid to keep her grounded.</p><p>"We <em>were</em> friends," she said carefully. "It was the only part of this that was unmistakably real. And it's the part you threw away."</p><p>The words landed heavy, but not cruel. Simply... honest.</p><p>Agatha's throat tightened again. "I know."</p><p>Rio nodded once, almost to herself. "I can be your friend. But I won't be temporary again. I won't let you reel me in just to decide later that closeness is too messy for the narrative you're trying to sell. If this is just another version of damage control, say it now."</p><p>She stepped forward, closer than before, but her voice stayed steady. <em>Final.</em></p><p>"Because if I stay - if I give this another shot, and you pull away again, I won't stick around this time. Not for you. Not for the money. I'll walk away completely."</p><p>A long pause stretched between them.</p><p>"But if you mean it, I'll stay. And we can try again," her voice gentled at the end. "Not for appearances. For us."</p><p>The silence that followed felt different than the one they'd lived in lately. This one wasn't filled with avoidance; it was <em>anticipation. </em>Heavy and expectant like the moment before a coin lands.</p><p>Agatha stood still, rooted in place by the truth laid bare between them. Her mind ran back over the past few weeks - not just the silence or the awkward tension, but the ache beneath it. The empty spaces that Rio used to fill. The warmth that used to live in the house.</p><p>And it hit her, slowly but surely, just how much of that loss had been her doing.</p><p>This wasn't a bluff on Rio's part. There would be no more careful tolerance of Agatha's emotional retreat if she made the same mistake again. If she treated Rio's closeness like a luxury she could pick up and put down at will, it wouldn't just cost her Rio's friendship. It would cost her <em>everything</em>. The home they were building, real or pretend. The strange, quiet intimacy that had started to feel like gravity. Nicky's glow when Rio was near.</p><p>And the inheritance.</p><p>Because if Rio walked away before the year was up, the deal would be void. Evanora would win.</p><p>Agatha's chest tightened.</p><p>She knew that was Rio's main concern - the deal, the money, and everything that had brought them together in the first place. This wasn't just a threat to walk away emotionally. Rio was telling her that she'd leave <em>entirely</em> if this wasn't real.</p><p>And still, that wasn't the reason the answer formed inside her. It wasn't a strategy. It wasn't fear. It rose from somewhere deeper, not like a choice, but like a truth that had always been waiting to be spoken.</p><p>She looked up, meeting Rio's eyes. "I'm not doing this for the deal," she said, firm but low. "I'm not going to change my mind this time."</p><p>She hesitated, her throat tightening again, but she pushed through it.</p><p>"And I understand what I'm risking by saying that. I know there won't be another try after this."</p><p>Her voice dropped, just enough to tremble. "But I still want to try."</p><p>For a second, Rio said nothing.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she studied Agatha, not suspiciously but like she was reading her for signs of a trap that never came. Then she let out a breath, somewhere between a sigh and a low laugh.</p><p>"Well," she said slowly, pushing off the island, "that's incredibly annoying."</p><p>Agatha blinked. "What is?"</p><p>"That I believe you," Rio said, lips twitching into a ghost of a smile. "I had a whole dramatic exit planned. Would've looked great in a movie, too. Good lighting, cutting line, walking out into the rain..."</p><p>"It's not raining," Agatha noticed automatically, still not sure what was happening.</p><p>Rio ignored her. "I'd already picked the music in my head. Something dark and broody with a crescendo that'd hit when I slammed the door for maximum effect," she sighed, shaking her head. "You were going to regret everything while it played."</p><p>A tug of laughter caught in Agatha's throat before it fully made it out. "I probably would've deserved it."</p><p>"Definitely," Rio replied. Then her gaze softened, her voice dipping. "But not tonight."</p><p>A pause stretched between them, gentler than before.</p><p>Then Rio turned back to her tote, reaching in to pull out a white pastry box. "I was going to eat these alone, but..." she popped the lid and held it open between them, "...I suppose I can share. One. Maybe two."</p><p>Inside were six oversized muffins, slightly squished from the trip.</p><p>Agatha blinked. "Shouldn't <em>I </em>be bribing <em>you</em>?"</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. "It's called peacekeeping. And I don't see you offering me anything."</p><p>Agatha leaned in, peering at the muffins. "My emotional growth doesn't count?"</p><p>"Mmm... maybe if you'd brought cinnamon streusel to go with it."</p><p>A small smile tugged at Agatha's lips. "Wanda <em>did</em> give us some brownies to share. Does that make my emotional growth sweeter?"</p><p>Before Rio could respond, Nicky's voice rang out from the living room. "You're missing all the important parts! Rio, c'mon!"</p><p>Honestly, Agatha couldn't even pretend to be offended that Nicky hadn't called for <em>her</em>.</p><p>Rio glanced at the doorway, a warm flicker passing through her expression. Then she looked back at Agatha, shifting the pastry box onto the counter.</p><p>"I'd love to," she said sincerely, "but I've got a deadline tonight. A stack of papers to grade and a paper outline I should've started yesterday."</p><p>Agatha's face fell for half a second before she caught herself.</p><p>Of course, Rio noticed.</p><p>"It's not an escape route, promise," she added gently. "Just the glamorous life of a PhD student."</p><p>Agatha nodded, the ache in her chest easing slightly. "There will be other movie nights."</p><p>Rio smiled, already moving toward the hall. "I'll bring the popcorn. You can bring your emotional growth and cinnamon streusel."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Nicky finally got what he wanted. </p><p>It was the first thing Agatha thought when she walked into the kitchen and found Rio already dressed, sitting at the island with a mug of coffee like waking up before noon on a Sunday wasn't a personal affront to her life philosophy. Her sunglasses were pushed up into her hair, and she was scrolling through Instagram with lazy swipes, probably barely registering whatever her friends had posted.</p><p>"You're awake," Agatha said, mostly because her brain hadn't caught up to the sight yet.</p><p>Rio looked up, her eyes clear despite the hour. "I promised I'd come," she straightened up in her chair, and her hair slipped over her shoulder, revealing the back of her T-shirt - green and black stripes stretched over her frame, the blocky white lines stark against them:</p><p>
<strong>HARKNESS</strong>
</p><p>The sight caused something between a jolt and a flutter in Agatha's stomach. It hit too deep, too fast, and before she could stop herself, her mouth moved on its own.</p><p>"You're wearing one of my jerseys."</p><p>Rio blinked down like she'd momentarily forgotten. "Oh. Yeah. Nicky gave it to me yesterday. Puppy eyes and a dramatic monologue were involved," she said with a crooked smile. "I didn't stand a chance."</p><p>She tugged at the hem, turning slightly to face Agatha more fully. "I hope it's okay."</p><p>Agatha's gaze lingered on the familiar fabric, slightly oversized on Rio in a way that made something in her chest ache - not just for how natural it looked, but for how natural it <em>felt</em>. Like something borrowed in the way things are borrowed between people who live their lives closely.</p><p>"It's okay," she said finally, her voice softer than she meant it to be. She cleared her throat not to tip her hand. "I have a bunch of them. Wanda doesn't know what restraint means."</p><p>"She's the one who got them?" Rio asked curiously, tilting her head in a way that promised undivided attention.</p><p>"She was in charge of <em>making</em> them," Agatha grumbled. "I asked for one, and she brought me six. Like I'd have someone else to give them to."</p><p>Rio smiled slowly. "You do now."</p><p>The words settled between them, quiet and unmissable.</p><p>Agatha didn't answer right away. She could still hear Rio's voice from that night - <em>I can be your friend. But I won't be temporary again.</em></p><p>It had only been a week since that conversation, but here they were. Sharing a kitchen on a Sunday morning, talking like it had always been that comfortable. And it wasn't pretend. That was the part that got her.</p><p>Something had shifted. Not dramatically, but like Rio had let herself settle back into the house again, into the quiet corners she used to occupy without thinking. Her speaker had reclaimed its spot on the island. They returned to eating - and sometimes cooking - together. Her absence no longer hung in the air like a weight.</p><p>And Agatha, for once, wasn't holding her breath waiting for it to vanish again.</p><p>She glanced away, busying herself with the coffee pot. "Right," she said lightly. "Guess I should be thankful she overestimated my social life."</p><p>Behind her, Rio chuckled, and the sound caused a wave of warmth in Agatha's chest. "Well, you're not getting this back," she mused. "So at least you have five more."</p><p>Agatha turned, taking a sip from her mug before she said something stupid like, <em>You can have all six if it means you'll keep wearing my name like that.</em></p><p>Instead, she rolled her eyes playfully. "Consider it a permanent loan."</p><p>Before Rio could reply, the unmistakable sound of sneakered feet thundered down the stairs. A second later, Nicky burst into the kitchen like a hurricane of cleats and polyester.</p><p>"There you are!" he exclaimed, almost doubling over from the weight of the duffle bag slung over his shoulder. His eyes landed on Rio first and lit up. "You're wearing the shirt!"</p><p>Rio chuckled and hopped off the chair, giving him a quick, dramatic twirl to show off the jersey. "You like it?"</p><p>Nicky's grin could've powered the neighborhood. "It's awesome! You and Mama match!"</p><p>Agatha blinked, not at the shirt or the excitement, but at the way he said it. <em>You and Mama</em>.</p><p>Like they belonged on the same side. Like he'd been waiting for them to realize that.</p><p>She glanced at Rio, who caught her eye for half a second and smiled softly, doing unspeakable things to Agatha's chest. She powered through the warm fluttering and grabbed her travel mug.</p><p>"Alright," she said, brushing a hand over Nicky's hair as she passed him. "Let's hit the road before Aunt Wanda starts blowing up my phone with threats of violence."</p><p>"Threats of violence?" Rio repeated, swinging her tote bag over her shoulder as she followed. "Over being late to a soccer game?"</p><p>Agatha shot her a look. "Wanda takes it <em>very</em> seriously."</p><p>"We can't be late!" Nicky jumped in, already darting for the door. "<em>¡Vámonos!"</em></p><p>"Well, at least the Spanish classes are paying off," Rio mused as she followed him, Agatha falling into step beside her.</p><p>It wasn't until they entered the garage and Rio moved to the passenger seat without hesitation that Agatha noticed how normal this felt. Not staged or tense, just... easy.</p><hr/><p>They drove with the windows cracked and the radio low, morning air tugging at the strands of their hair. From the moment the car hit the road, Nicky launched into a full-blown analysis of his upcoming match, dragging Rio into a back-and-forth about positions, strategy, and the unspoken superiority of neon cleats.</p><p>Agatha half-listened. Not the content, though Rio's knowledge of the rules was quite impressive, making her remember that the woman had actually <em>played</em> the sport before, but to the tone. There was an eagerness in Nicky's voice that had dimmed during the quiet weeks. And Rio matched it without missing a beat, her replies light and teasing, but never dismissive.</p><p>They were easy together, and the sound of it did something to Agatha's chest. Not for the first time, she found herself wondering what she'd been thinking when she tried to put distance between them. What had she expected to accomplish by ripping Rio away from this - <em>from them </em>- like it wouldn't leave a jagged, hollow space behind?</p><p>Back then, it had felt like the responsible thing. Necessary, even. Her own heart was one thing - she could rationalize that risk, bury her feelings, and stay focused on the terms of their deal. But Nicky? Nicky was a wildcard. The cost she couldn't afford.</p><p>She'd seen the way his face lit up around Rio. The way he brought her into his stories and routines without hesitation. Like she was a fixture, not a guest. And Agatha hadn't wanted him to lose that. To lose <em>her</em>. Because once the contract ended with signed divorce papers and Rio moving out, everything would be over.</p><p>But now, a week after their conversation, Agatha was starting to see it differently. They'd worked out a tentative kind of peace, but Agatha could see the potential. Maybe, just maybe, the end of the deal didn't have to mean cutting Rio out of their lives completely.</p><p>Sure, they'd get divorced. Legally, the performance would end. But if the friendship they were building was real - and Agatha was beginning to believe it might be - then it could survive the paperwork. Plenty of exes stayed friends.</p><p>Well, <em>some</em> exes.</p><p>Okay, maybe not many. But sapphic relationships were practically built on the sacred art of staying friends with your ex. It was almost like a rite of passage. Nothing weird about that.</p><p>The idea made her stomach flutter with something that felt suspiciously close to hope.</p><p>Of course, there were <em>complications</em> to that plan. Namely, her own treacherous feelings.</p><p>If keeping Rio at arm's length hadn't worked - and it obviously fucking hadn't - then continuing their relationship past the deal's expiration would be even worse. The pretense might end, but the feelings wouldn't. The more they fell back into their old rhythm, the more Agatha realized she hadn't learned how to be near Rio without wanting <em>more</em>.</p><p>The friendship was already testing her limits. After nearly a month of distance, re-entering Rio's orbit felt like slipping back into gravity. Every glance, every laugh, every moment of casual closeness hit harder than it should. She soaked them up like someone who'd been starved of light.</p><p>She relished the sound of Rio's laughter. Craved her presence with a quiet desperation she barely understood. Missed the way Rio used to brush their arms together when she passed, or lean in close to show her something on her phone. She missed her like she had the right to.</p><p>And every time she remembered that they were friends now - <em>just</em> friends - something hollow opened up in her chest.</p><p>But she could carry it. She <em>had</em> to. If the friendship was all that could survive the end of this arrangement, then she would hold onto it for Nicky's sake.</p><p>Maybe for her own, too. After all, it was better to have Rio in her life as just a friend than not at all. Besides, the feelings could still pass. It had only been a month since she'd really let herself <em>see</em> how she felt about Rio. That wasn't long enough for anything to root too deeply. Maybe, once the contract ended and the illusion dissolved, so would the feelings. Just because emotional distance hadn't worked, it didn't mean physical distance wouldn't either.</p><p>Maybe once Rio moved out and Agatha had the room to breathe without feeling like she'd ruined something, the ache would dull into something manageable. Something forgettable.</p><p>She'd just have to wait it out.</p><p>By the time they pulled up to the field, the early morning had burned off most of the haze. Agatha parked under the shade of a large maple, barely putting the car in park before Nicky scrambled out with his gear. "See you later!" he yelled over his shoulder, already running.</p><p>Rio got out more slowly, slinging her tote bag over her shoulder and stretching out her arms. Her eyes slid over the bleachers and the half-empty parking lot before she pulled her sunglasses down. "That's the most people I've ever seen at a kids' soccer match."</p><p>"It's the weather," Agatha said, stepping out and closing her door with a soft thud, her travel mug in her hands. "Once it gets cold, the crowds thin out fast. Not many parents are eager to shiver through an hour of mediocre footwork and bad officiating."</p><p>Rio grinned sideways. "You show up every weekend without even knowing the rules."</p><p>Agatha shrugged, unbothered. "It means the world to Nicky. And I don't need to know the rules to yell at the ref."</p><p>Rio gave her a long look, something amused and contemplative in the angle of her head. "Speaking of rules," she said after a pause, tongue nudging the inside of her cheek in a familiar habit that pulled at something deep in Agatha's chest. God, she'd missed that look. "Most people here will know you, right? Since you're basically a regular."</p><p>Agatha locked the car, her brows pulling slightly. "Yeah, I guess. Nicky's been on this team for a while. The parents recognize each other. Why?"</p><p>Rio gestured broadly toward the field, then to herself, sunglasses catching the light. "How do you want to play it then? To sell us as wives." Her voice dipped slightly into something wry, edged with humor, but Agatha caught the thread of care woven beneath the teasing, like Rio was giving her the choice, not just asking for instructions.</p><p>It was the first time either of them had mentioned the deal since establishing their friendship. Agatha had avoided it like the plague, partly out of fear of jinxing the new ease between them, and partly because she didn't want to think about it.</p><p>And anyway, who would be scrutinizing them at a kids' soccer game?</p><p>Of course, the answer was easy: her mother. Evanora wouldn't waste a single opportunity to sniff out weakness. So, no. Hoping for anonymity here was less optimism and more sheer stupidity.</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, noting the slight tension in her shoulders as she waited for the answer, wearing <em>her </em>jersey like it had always belonged to her.</p><p>Honestly, Agatha couldn't stop the next words even if she tried. "I think some casual touches should be enough," she said, refusing to let her cheeks grow pink. "God knows who my mother will send."</p><p>The corners of Rio's lips curved downward in a displeased grimace at the mention of Evanora. Then she seemed to shake it off, hitching her tote higher on her shoulder as the tightness melted from her posture.</p><p>"Alright then," she said lightly, circling the car to Agatha's side. Without hesitation, she reached for her hand and took it with easy familiarity, her palm warm against Agatha's. "I'll try not to outshine you too badly on the bleachers. I plan to be <em>very</em> vocal with the ref, since I actually know the rules."</p><p>Agatha's mouth twitched, her fingers relaxing in Rio's grip. "You're impossible."</p><p>"And you're stuck with me," Rio replied, her thumb brushing against Agatha's knuckles almost absentmindedly. "At least until the final whistle."</p><p>The words paired with the gentle touch tugged at something in Agatha's heart a bit too forcefully. She used the hold on Rio's hand to tug her toward the pitch.</p><p>"Vision will be glad to have someone to talk to about what's happening," she said, desperate for a topic change. "He's given up on trying to explain it to me."</p><p>If Rio sensed her uneasiness, she didn't let it show. Her smile was half-teasing, with warmth woven into the slight curve of her lips. "Soccer isn't complicated. Something tells me you didn't even try to understand."</p><p>"Well," Agatha's eyes swept across the bleachers, noticing Wanda and her husband in the first row, "Vision calls it <em>football</em> for starters. It's sacrilegious," she grumbled, pulling Rio toward them.</p><p>"Because you're an avid football fan?"</p><p>"At least I know most of the rules."</p><p>Rio chuckled. "Right. So, how exactly does your support here look?"</p><p>"I cheer when Nicky kicks the ball," Agatha shrugged. "That seems like the main thing."</p><p>"You cheer for <em>every </em>kick?"</p><p>Agatha gave her a look. "That's called being supportive."</p><p>"It's called not knowing what's happening," Rio said, bumping their shoulders together. Her grin was bright, and for a moment, Agatha forgot why she'd been feeling tense in the first place. "Don't worry, I'll keep you in the loop."</p><p>"Please don't," Agatha rolled her eyes, failing to hide the smile tugging at her mouth.</p><p>They reached the first row of the bleachers, where Wanda immediately zeroed in on them. Her eyes swept over their matching jerseys with a glint of triumph.</p><p>"Well, don't you two look like a magazine cover waiting to happen," she said, leaning back with the smugness of someone who'd predicted this exact moment. Her gaze settled on Agatha. "Told you you'd need more jerseys."</p><p>Agatha sighed. "Yes, Wanda. You're all-knowing. We're just flailing through life while you orchestrate fate from your throne."</p><p>Wanda didn't flinch at the sarcasm. She beamed, utterly unbothered. "Finally, some recognition."</p><p>Then she turned toward Rio, her tone softening. "It's good to see you again." She tipped her head toward the man beside her. "This is my husband, Vision."</p><p>At the sound of his name, Vision stood with courteous precision, offering Rio his hand and a polite, earnest smile. "Pleasure to finally meet you. Wanda speaks of you often."</p><p>Rio released Agatha's hand to shake his. "Interesting, considering we've only met a couple of times," she said playfully, her eyes sliding over to Agatha. "Been talking about me?"</p><p>Agatha dropped into the seat next to Wanda like she could physically dodge the question. "Oh, look at that - the game's starting."</p><p>"They're still stretching," Rio laughed, taking the seat beside her. She didn't make a show of it, but her thigh pressed comfortably against Agatha's, her arm brushing close as she got situated.</p><p>The contact caused a wave of warmth across Agatha's body, swift and unsettling in its intensity. She kept her gaze fixed on the field, but her awareness narrowed to every inch where their bodies touched.</p><p>Though they'd been working on building their friendship, Rio hadn't returned to the easy touches she used to offer without thinking - a hand lingering on Agatha's back in passing, fingers brushing as she passed her a mug. That had disappeared after Agatha asked for space. This quiet, unspoken proximity was the closest they'd been since the party.</p><p>Agatha didn't know if Rio noticed. But she did.</p><p>She noticed the heat under her skin, the rise in her pulse, the way her shoulder tilted in rather than away like Rio had a gravitational field too strong to resist. She didn't move.</p><p>They were in a public place, after all. The physical closeness was a part of the act.</p><p>About ten minutes into the game, Agatha realized Rio took soccer <em>seriously</em>. Her eyes tracked the ball with near laser focus, following it across the pitch like a well-trained golden retriever - sharp, alert, and just shy of barking orders. Her lips moved constantly, murmuring strategy under her breath like she was coaching telepathically. She slouched forward the second Nicky got the ball, elbows braced on her knees in a posture Agatha recognized immediately: the final lap of Mario Kart. Rio was poised to leap up, entirely absorbed, ready to celebrate or curse out the ref at any moment.</p><p>Agatha shouldn't find it adorable.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>She bit her tongue against teasing and held back her smile, content to watch Rio's reactions more than the game itself. There was something disarming about seeing her like this - unguarded, completely immersed in something she clearly held close to the heart. Her knee bounced every time the ball got near Nicky, and her breath caught audibly when he took a shot on goal, even if it veered wide.</p><p>"You act like you have money riding on this game," Agatha murmured, leaning forward to get on Rio's level.</p><p>Rio didn't glance away from the field. "He hesitated too long - he had it."</p><p>"You realize he's ten."</p><p>"He's ten and talented," Rio countered, finally turning to face her. "And if defense gets tighter in the second half, he won't get that window again."</p><p>Agatha blinked, surprised not by the analysis, but by the way her eyes sparkled when she talked about it. Like she actually <em>cared</em>. Like she wasn't just showing up because Nicky had strong-armed her into it.</p><p>Warmth curled in Agatha's chest again, heavier this time. More complicated. She looked back out at the field to give herself a second to breathe.</p><p>"Right," she said, her voice a little too casual. "The defense is ten as well. Maybe they won't... stand closer?"</p><p>Rio smiled, nudging her gently. "Careful, or I'll think you're trying to understand the rules."</p><p>Agatha made a face, but couldn't hold back her own smile. Seeing Rio so animated made her want to ask every question under the sun about soccer, if only to keep her beaming like this.</p><p>And that was dangerous.</p><p>Friends didn't get butterflies in their stomachs from watching each other enjoy something. Friends didn't think about preserving someone's joy just to feel close to it.</p><p>She folded her arms and sat up straighter, forcing her attention back to the field. "Vision can tell you how useless explaining the rules to me is," she said louder than necessary, slicing the moment clean.</p><p>"Maybe he's just not pretty enough to hold your attention," Wanda teased, grinning widely.</p><p>Agatha shot her a look. "Or maybe his accent is just too annoying to listen to," she countered dryly, immediately regretting the words.</p><p>Vision had barely spoken during the game, let alone done anything to earn her snark. Under different circumstances, Agatha wouldn't care, but she needed someone in her corner in case Wanda had some stupid ideas for after the game ended, like forcing everyone to go out for lunch.</p><p>She glanced down the row at Vision. "No offense."</p><p>Vision gave a slow, sideways smile. "None taken."</p><p>Wanda leaned in, whispering loudly enough to be heard anyway, "You always get mean when you're flustered."</p><p>Agatha didn't dignify that with a response, mostly because it was true. She caught Rio's glance out of the corner of her eye, noting that the soft amusement was still there.</p><p>If she'd noticed Agatha's derailment, she was kind enough not to mention it.</p><p>Instead, Rio leaned back in her seat, resting her arm along the top of the edge of the bleachers behind Agatha, casual and calm. "If it makes you feel better," she murmured, voice low enough that only Agatha could hear, "I've always liked you better rude."</p><p>The words slid under her skin too easily, like everything Rio said lately. A chill trailed down her spine, followed too quickly by heat.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her travel mug, heart thudding with the kind of clarity that only ever made things harder.</p><p>Jesus, she was in so much fucking trouble.</p><p>"Good," she said, carefully measured, not looking at her. "Because being nice isn't my forte."</p><p>"Keep telling yourself that," Rio bumped their knees again, spreading more warmth across Agatha's body.</p><p>Agatha tried not to linger on the feel of the arm brushing lightly behind her shoulders. She tried not to wonder what it would feel like if Rio let it fall the rest of the way. She tried, failed, and sat there quietly pretending she hadn't.</p><p>On the field, the referee's whistle pierced the air, signaling the end of the first half. The pitch dissolved into chaos as players jogged to their coaches, and the bleachers began to stir with parents eager to stretch their legs and trade gossip.</p><p>Agatha latched onto the distraction like a lifeline.</p><p>"So," she said too brightly, "what are we thinking about the game? They're doing pretty well, right?"</p><p>Every head turned to look at her like she'd just asked if the sky was purple. A beat passed before Vision, ever the peacemaker, spoke gently with confusion threading his tone. "They're losing. Two-nil."</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek.</p><p>Right. Scorekeeping. That was a thing normal spectators did. Usually, she kept up with it too. But this time, she'd spent the entire first half watching Rio instead of the ball.</p><p>Thankfully, the reason for her predicament jumped in before she could dig herself an even deeper grave.</p><p>"Honestly, the second one shouldn't count," Rio huffed. "There was a hand involved. The ref's blind."</p><p>Agatha remembered that moment in the game. Not because she'd <em>seen</em> the so-called handball, but because Rio had jumped out of her seat like it was on fire. She'd startled half the parents in the row, voice cutting through the noise like a siren. Agatha had nearly spilled her coffee, torn between embarrassment and an uninvited swell of affection that had lodged itself stubbornly in her chest.</p><p>"I second that," Vision said, drawing Agatha back with a thoughtful nod. He rested his arm behind Wanda's seat, tilting slightly toward Rio in interest. The casual affection in the gesture made Agatha's chest fill with something hot and unfair. She focused on her drink instead, as if the straw might suddenly whisper the cure for ridiculous feelings.</p><p>"The boys tell me you used to play," Vision added.</p><p>Rio's face lit up with a grin that made Agatha's stomach somersault.</p><p>"Do they?" she laughed, stretching her legs out in front of her with the lazy ease of someone confident in their cool points. "Guess I'm a hot topic in the Maximoff household."</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes fondly. "You're in the rotation. Right between dinosaurs and video games."</p><p>"Elite company," Rio deadpanned, then turned her attention back to Vision. "Yeah, I played all through high school. Had a shot at a full-ride scholarship, actually. Until I fucked up my knee senior year."</p><p>"ACL?" Vision asked, brows pinching with sympathy. He exhaled softly when Rio nodded. "That's rough. You still play at all?"</p><p>"Not really," Rio shrugged, but Agatha picked up on the tinge of sadness in her voice. "I moved on to basketball on Fridays with my friends. But I used to coach rec leagues when I first moved here. Paid just enough to cover groceries and gas."</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, her voice gentler. "Do you miss it?"</p><p>"Playing? Yeah." The answer came easily, with no hesitation. But there was weight in it, like the ache of an old song you couldn't quite stop humming. "I mean, I get my fix where I can, but... basketball's already pushing it. Returning to soccer would probably put me back under the knife."</p><p>She smiled like it was a joke, but it didn't quite reach her eyes.</p><p>Agatha found herself watching the profile of Rio's face instead of the field again. The sun caught the edges of her sunglasses, and the wind tugged at the loose strands of her hair. She didn't say anything - couldn't, really - but something tightened in her chest. Not pity. Admiration, maybe. Grief, too, on Rio's behalf. For the things she clearly still loved, but had to let go without complaint.</p><p>"What about coaching?" Vision nodded toward the field. "Do you miss being on the sidelines?"</p><p>Rio hummed thoughtfully, eyes on the teams huddled around their coaches. "A bit, I guess. It's rewarding in a different way."</p><p>Vision glanced at Wanda. "Isn't the assistant coach leaving next season?"</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. "Wait, are you-"</p><p>"She'd be great," Wanda cut in smoothly, addressing Vision but casting a sidelong glance at Agatha. "She already knows the game, she's good with kids, and she's... assertive when needed. Exactly what those teams need."</p><p>Rio laughed, quirking an eyebrow. "Assertive?"</p><p>Wanda shrugged. "You scared the ref into checking his glasses and an annoying parent into silence. I stand by my assessment."</p><p>"I was advocating," Rio protested.</p><p>"Very effectively," Agatha muttered, suppressing a smile.</p><p>Rio nudged her knee again, her voice low. "Jealous I stole the show?"</p><p>Agatha didn't answer, mostly because Vision was looking at them like someone watching a home video he didn't know he'd been in.</p><p>He turned back to Rio, thoughtful. "You should really consider it. They'll want someone consistent, and Nicky clearly adores you. It'd be a natural fit."</p><p>Agatha went still.</p><p>She saw it hit Wanda, a flicker of guilt crossing her face - almost imperceptible, but Agatha caught it all the same. Wanda had backed up Vision's suggestion without hesitation. As if Rio weren't a temporary fixture. As if this wasn't all borrowed time.</p><p>Like she'd forgotten the marriage was fake after spending an hour on the bleachers with them.</p><p>That hurt more than Agatha wanted to admit. Because if even Wanda - one of the few people who knew the truth - could fall for the act, what hope did Agatha have of keeping her heart out of it?</p><p>She glanced at Rio, whose smile didn't quite reach her eyes. "Thanks," she said lightly. "I'll think about it."</p><p>And Agatha, for once, had nothing to say at all.</p><hr/><p>The game ended in a draw, with Tommy scoring the final goal five minutes before the whistle. Agatha had made a pointed effort to keep her eyes on the pitch during the second half, forcing herself to focus on the movement of the ball rather than the pull of the woman beside her. Still, she couldn't help but notice that Rio had grown quieter. She still watched intently, made the occasional sharp comment, or clapped at key moments, but there was a subtle shift as if her reactions were coming from muscle memory rather than enthusiasm.</p><p>Agatha regretted apologizing to Vision for taking a jab at his ridiculous accent. Petty, maybe, but it had been easier to blame him than confront the fact that his suggestion had struck far too close to something she wasn't ready to deal with.</p><p>It wasn't Vision's fault. He had no way of knowing Rio wasn't on the bleachers to stay for seasons to come. From the outside, they probably looked... stable. Like a family.</p><p>And Rio was good with kids. She had the necessary experience in playing and coaching. She'd be perfect for the team.</p><p>That was the problem.</p><p>Rio <em>could</em> take the coaching gig and continue after the divorce if they stayed friends. But Agatha wasn't sure if keeping her that close, week after week, from the sidelines, just within reach, was something she could survive.</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>The one silver lining of Vision's suggestion was that it seemed to jar Wanda enough not to suggest brunch or a group outing after the game. They exchanged goodbyes, with Wanda giving Agatha a look that hovered somewhere between guilt and sympathy, and then they made their way back to the car.</p><p>Nicky was noticeably less chipper than he'd been that morning.</p><p>"I'm serious, buddy, a draw is a good outcome," Rio said for what must've been the hundredth time, craning her neck to look into the backseat as they climbed into the car. Her voice was gentle but firm, the kind she used when she wanted Nicky to believe her. "Don't beat yourself up over it. You played your heart out."</p><p>Nicky crossed his arms, his eyes locked on the window. "I had a clean shot and messed it up."</p><p>Agatha started the car but didn't pull out of the lot yet, glancing at him through the rearview mirror. "You're ten. You're allowed to mess up."</p><p>Rio twisted in her seat, her eyes soft. "Besides, you didn't mess it up. You tried. You saw the opportunity and had the guts to take the shot."</p><p>"That's what matters," Agatha added. "You think professional players score every time?"</p><p>Nicky pursed his lips, glancing at Rio uncertainly. "Did you score every time?"</p><p>"God, no," Rio laughed, bracing her elbow near Agatha's headrest as she leaned in. "I had matches where I took shot after shot and didn't score once. But I never let it discourage me. It's a part of the game - taking the risk and hoping something positive comes out of it."</p><p>Nicky hesitated again. "So you'll come to my next game? Even if I didn't win?"</p><p>Rio's expression softened in a way that made something in Agatha's chest clench.</p><p>"Of course I will," she said without missing a beat. "Win or lose, I'll be there yelling at the ref like my life depends on it."</p><p>That pulled a reluctant smile from Nicky, though he tried to hide it by sinking further into his seat. "You don't have to yell so loud."</p><p>Rio grinned. "That's part of the deal. You lose your breath playing your heart out, I lose mine screaming from the sidelines."</p><p>Agatha felt the corners of her mouth lift. She'd learned a long time ago that Rio's affection for Nicky wasn't a part of the performance, but it still warmed her heart every time she saw it reflected so clearly. The way Rio looked at him like he mattered. Like he wasn't just a kid of a woman she'd married for a check, but someone worth showing up for.</p><p>As Rio settled back into her seat, buckling her seatbelt with a soft clink, Agatha felt her heart sink.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>The game was over. The spell would break soon. They'd go back to the house, where things were comfortable, yes, but still careful. Where Rio's touches were nonexistent, and her words seemed more measured. Where they were working on being friends.</p><p>Agatha wasn't ready to let go of this moment, of the easy laughter and sun-warmed bleachers and the thrill of pretending they were something real.</p><p>So she shifted the car into reverse, forcing casual into her tone. "How about some pizza? To celebrate being brave enough to take risks?"</p><p>The words felt hypocritical. If pizza was the reward for taking the plunge and hoping for the best, Agatha certainly didn't deserve even a piece of burnt crust.</p><p>From the back seat, Nicky perked up instantly. "Yes! Can we get garlic knots too? And ice cream after?"</p><p>Rio chuckled, glancing at Agatha with a knowing smirk. "Pizza for lunch? What happened to cutting down on takeout?"</p><p>Agatha shrugged, keeping her eyes on the road. "It was wishful thinking at best."</p><p>Rio's fingers drummed lightly against the door, the tendrils jumping with the movement in Agatha's peripheral vision. She felt a pulse of heat shoot up her spine. "Alright," Rio said. "But I'm choosing the toppings."</p><p>"No chance," Agatha pulled a face. "Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza."</p><p>"You're saying that because you've been brainwashed by the media."</p><p>"No, I'm saying that because it's true."</p><p>Nicky leaned forward, tugging at his seatbelt. "I like the pineapple. It's sweet."</p><p>Agatha gasped in mock offense. "And now you've radicalized him!"</p><p>Rio let out a triumphant laugh, turning slightly in her seat to grin back at Nicky. "See? The youth have taste. There's still hope for the future."</p><p>Agatha groaned, but the sound came out more amused than exasperated. "This is a mutiny. I'm outnumbered in my own car."</p><p>"Democracy in action," Rio said lightly, her smile soft as she looked at Agatha. "Learn to lose with grace."</p><p>Agatha caught the glance and her grip on the steering wheel tightened. There was something about the way Rio looked at her sometimes, quiet and unreadable, like she was searching for an answer to some unasked question. Agatha didn't dare imagine what that question might be.</p><p>"So," she said, clearing her throat, "quarter mushroom, quarter pineapple, and half pepperoni?"</p><p>"Compromise," Rio nodded. "I'm proud of you."</p><p>"Don't be," Agatha muttered. "I'm already planning my revenge."</p><p>From the backseat, Nicky piped up again. "Can your revenge involve the garlic knots?"</p><p>Rio laughed again, and Agatha gave in, letting the sound carry through the car like sunlight through a half-open window. For a moment, the legal documents and closing dates faded.</p><p>They weren't a real family.</p><p>But as Agatha signaled left toward their favorite pizza place and Rio continued her campaign to convert the car to pineapple-lovers anonymous, still dressed in Agatha’s jersey and after spending her Sunday morning cheering for Nicky, it sure didn't feel like a lie. Not in that moment.</p><p>And that was probably half of the problem.</p>

<p>Agatha tugged at the collar of her blouse as she moved toward the door, still debating whether to undo the top two buttons. Not enough to be scandalous - she had a reputation to maintain - but maybe just enough to suggest she was desirable. A little tempting.</p><p>Not that she had <em>any reason</em> to want to seem tempting. Obviously.</p><p>After all, it was just a date with her fake wife to convince her cunt of a mother that the marriage wasn't a sham. A performance in a theater, really. The only thing lacking was rehearsing the lines.</p><p>Still, she checked her reflection in the hallway mirror, adjusted her earrings, and smoothed a hand down the front of her blouse with a sigh that was too resigned for someone supposedly playing a romantic lead.</p><p>The whole thing had been Rio's idea, oddly enough.</p><p>She'd appeared at Agatha's office door on Wednesday evening, her knock brisk, her expression unreadably calm. Her jaw had been set, arms stiff at her sides like she'd spent a long time psyching herself up just to walk down the hall.</p><p>Agatha had looked up from the contract she was redlining, arching a brow over the rim of her glasses. "Something on fire?"</p><p>"We should revisit the idea of dates," Rio said, her voice firm and unusually serious.</p><p>She didn't step further into the room. Just hovered by the door, her back ramrod straight.</p><p>Agatha blinked. "I'm sorry, the idea of <em>what</em>?"</p><p>"The dates," Rio said, a little sharper this time. "Public outings. Dinners. Hand-holding in venues where people might be watching. You know, <em>married stuff.</em>"</p><p>There was something a little too practiced about the way she said it. The way she avoided looking directly at Agatha, like she knew she was pushing a line and didn't want to see the reaction, for example.</p><p>"Step up our game," she added, a bit softer. "Make it less easy to doubt."</p><p>Agatha lowered her pen slowly, heart thumping just enough to be annoying. "And you're acting like it's a matter of life or death because?"</p><p>Rio's eyes flicked up. "Because we've only been out together, what? Three times? We need to show consistency. Momentum."</p><p>"Momentum," Agatha echoed as if tasting the word for the first time. "Right. Because my mother is a vulture and is now circling us, hoping we'll keel over."</p><p>Rio didn't laugh, not even a twitch of the mouth. That was when Agatha realized something <em>was</em> off. Rio was usually quick with a smirk or a quip, especially when it came to demeaning Evanora. But now? She looked like she was bracing for impact.</p><p>Too stunned to press it, Agatha nodded slowly. "Okay. What did you have in mind?"</p><p>"A dinner on Friday. If Sharon's available to watch Nicky."</p><p>"You work Friday nights."</p><p>"I switched with Alice."</p><p>Agatha sat back in her chair, setting her pen down. "You what?"</p><p>"I switched shifts," Rio repeated, voice tight. "So we could go out. Just make sure Sharon's free."</p><p>Then she turned and left before Agatha could find a follow-up question sharp enough to catch her.</p><p>Now, two days later, Agatha reached for the front door handle to let Sharon in, something uneasy swirling in her chest. It wasn't nerves about the date, that would have at least made sense. No, this was something else. Something more like... suspicion.</p><p>She shoved the feeling aside just in time to dodge a pair of arms lunging in her direction.</p><p>"Ah! Not a hugger, still getting used to it!" Sharon beamed, her grin wide enough to flash molars, undeterred as always.</p><p>Agatha sidestepped like a seasoned fencer, offering a tight-lipped grimace as she opened the door wider. "Evening, Mrs. Hart."</p><p>"Sha-ron," the woman corrected, dragging her name out theatrically. "Honestly, dear, don't make me think you're doing that on purpose."</p><p>Agatha refrained from pointing out that she absolutely was.</p><p>Sharon slipped inside with a pep in her step, her energy already ricocheting off the walls. Her gaze did a once-over, pausing long enough to make Agatha shift on her heels.</p><p>"Well, don't you look nice!" Sharon teased with a poor attempt at winking. "Hot date?"</p><p>"Date night," Agatha replied flatly, reaching for her purse. She should've made Rio answer the door. They could've talked about tomato plants or lawn fertilizer while Agatha slipped out unnoticed.</p><p>Sharon raised an eyebrow as she took off her shoes. "With the missus, I presume?"</p><p>Agatha didn't bother responding. The answer was obvious, and she didn't trust her tone not to sound conflicted.</p><p>Besides, as if on cue, slow steps sounded on the stairs, snapping Agatha's attention like a rubber band.</p><p>Rio stepped into the hall a second later.</p><p>And Agatha momentarily forgot about Sharon.</p><p>Her hair was pulled back in a low, loose twist, a few strands artfully left to frame her face. She wore beige slacks and a white, silky blouse with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows. Her ears glinted with tiny gold hoops, and her eyes popped out because of the carefully applied eyeliner.</p><p>She wasn't dressed up, exactly. More effortlessly elegant.</p><p>It did something to Agatha's insides nonetheless.</p><p>They stared at each other for a beat, eyes roaming like they had every right to before Sharon piped up.</p><p>"Good evening, Rio!" she chirped, beaming between them like she'd just witnessed the climax of a rom-com. "Honestly, you two make such a beautiful couple!"</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, shifting her weight. "Hello, Sharon. Thank you."</p><p>"It's so romantic that you still find the time for date nights," Sharon continued. "It's so important in a marriage. I remember when-"</p><p>"Well, we better get going," Agatha cut in quickly, shooting Rio a look. "Wouldn't want to miss our reservation."</p><p>She had no idea if there even <em>was</em> a reservation since Rio hadn't told her where they were going, but she figured it was an excuse as good as any to get Sharon off their backs.</p><p>Rio nodded smoothly, stepping in to grab the car keys off the hook. "You're right. Traffic's already building."</p><p>She offered Sharon an apologetic smile that seemed genuine enough, and rested her hand gently on Agatha's back to steer her toward the door. The contact was brief, barely there, but Agatha felt it like a brand.</p><p>"Nicky, we're leaving!" she shouted into the house. "Be good!"</p><p>"I always am!" Nicky yelled back from the living room where she'd left him after saying a proper goodbye. "Have fun!"</p><p>"Yes, have a lovely evening!" Sharon added as they stepped into the garage. "We'll be just fine!"</p><p>Agatha hummed noncommittally, letting the door slam shut behind her.</p><p>"Every encounter with that woman takes a year of my life," she muttered, keeping her voice low as she moved toward the car.</p><p>Rio chuckled under her breath, unlocking the car with a soft beep. "She means well."</p><p>Agatha shot her a look over the roof of the car. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions."</p><p>Rio's grin stretched lazily as she slid into the driver's seat. "You're in a <em>mood</em> tonight."</p><p>"Can you blame me?" Agatha muttered, buckling her seatbelt as she settled into the passenger seat. She realized, belatedly, that she hadn't even tried to argue about driving. Worse, Rio had taken the keys off the hook like they were hers to take. Like driving Agatha's car was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Her fingers twitched slightly in her lap. "Why aren't we taking your car?"</p><p>Rio reached to adjust the rearview mirror as the garage doors whirred to life, golden light filtering in from the setting sun. "Would you set foot in it?"</p><p>Agatha glanced at the beat-up Toyota parked to their left, dented on one side, perpetually dusty, and missing a hubcap. She kept her frown to herself. "Yes? I'm not a spoiled brat."</p><p>"Mm," Rio's tone was noncommittal, but her lips twitched again as she shifted the car into reverse. "Then let's say I'm taking the opportunity to drive a vehicle that essentially drives itself."</p><p>Agatha gave her a long look. "That's not what this is. You're asserting dominance."</p><p>"Interesting," Rio said, easing them down the driveway. "And how exactly am I doing that?"</p><p>"Taking <em>my</em> car. Choosing the restaurant. Wearing <em>that</em> shirt." Agatha gestured vaguely toward Rio's neckline, where the top few buttons of her blouse remained open just enough to make breathing difficult. "You're setting the tempo."</p><p>Rio hummed again, eyes on the road as they turned out of the driveway. "I'm painting a picture."</p><p>"For whom?"</p><p>"Anyone who might be watching," Rio replied easily. "You said it yourself - the PI is a concern. Doing the bare minimum works when no one's paying attention, but won't hold up under real scrutiny."</p><p>There was something sharper beneath the surface of her voice, not quite urgency or fear, but something close to both. Agatha clocked it and filed it away for later.</p><p>"You think we haven't been convincing?" she asked carefully.</p><p>Rio shrugged casually, but it felt like a deflection. "Convincing enough for casual observers like Sharon, maybe. But not for skeptics."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. "You're being weird."</p><p>Rio laughed, short and soft. "I've always been weird. You're just finally noticing it."</p><p>Agatha didn't smile. She wanted to press. <em>Badly</em>. The sudden shift in Rio's investment didn't track. <em>Agatha</em> had always been the one to plan their moves. She'd nearly brought up the PI three separate times, only to back off and preserve the fragile calm between them. And now Rio was driving her car, picking restaurants, and talking like they'd been under surveillance from day one?</p><p>It felt like a pivot. One Agatha hadn't seen coming.</p><p>Before she could comment, though, Rio changed lines with a smooth flick of her wrist and said, "You look nice tonight."</p><p>The words caused an involuntary twitch in her jaw. She'd been a lawyer long enough to see a diversion, especially an obvious one. But something in the sharp lines of Rio's profile told her that pushing wasn't the right choice. Not unless she wanted the date to feel like a Way of the Cross.</p><p>"You already said that."</p><p>"No, Sharon said it. I'm saying it now."</p><p>Agatha's heart skipped a beat despite her best efforts. "You don't have to-"</p><p>"I know," Rio cut in, not looking away from the road. "But I wanted to."</p><p>The silence that followed was charged, thick enough to cut. Agatha stared out the windshield, biting the inside of her cheek, unsure how to respond without giving too much away.</p><p>Eventually, she settled for, "You don't look terrible either."</p><p>Rio's grin returned, wider this time. "High praise."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but turned her head to stare out the side window and hide the blush dusting her cheeks.</p><p>In the past two weeks, since they'd struck the truce of tentative friendship, Rio had started offering those kinds of comments again. Little things, dropped with the same offhand ease she used to put coffee in front of Agatha whenever she worked at the dining table. You look sharp today. That smells amazing. Lilia told me you bagged an important client, nice work. They came at random times, both in private and in public, consistent enough to notice, but not to create a pattern.</p><p>None were overtly flirtatious. Not exactly. But they lingered in her mind long after they were said, looping on repeat while she tried to decode their meaning. Were they just part of being Rio's friend? Or was there something else in them, something deliberate?</p><p>Agatha wasn't sure. She couldn't be.</p><p>Because if she let herself believe Rio meant more - if she started reading into every quiet praise and sideways glance - then she'd have to reckon with the fact that she <em>wanted</em> it to mean more. That she looked for it now. And that was dangerous.</p><p>Rio hadn't crossed the friendship line once. The comments were kind and meaningful, but not whispered in a sultry voice with clear intentions. The duality made them feel both like a clue and a trap.</p><p>So Agatha did what she did best: compartmentalized. She ignored the heat in her chest and told herself it was Rio being nice. Thoughtful. Observant.</p><p>She also made a mental note to pay closer attention whenever Rio interacted with her other friends, though she couldn't imagine Rio telling Alice that the color of her shirt brought out her eyes.</p><p>The car rolled to a stop, pulling her out of her thoughts. Dusk had begun to slip into full evening, making warm light spill from the restaurant's tall windows, casting golden patches onto the pavement. It wasn't a place Agatha recognized, but then again, she couldn't remember the last time she'd been on a date. And this place, with linen-covered tables and lit candles visible through the glass, certainly checked all the boxes for a romantic dinner.</p><p>Before Agatha could dwell on it, Rio cut the engine and turned slightly in her seat to face her. "Still think I'm asserting dominance?</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, unbuckling her seatbelt. "I'm keeping my thoughts to myself. For now."</p><p>Rio chuckled and stepped out, circling the car to open the passenger door for her before Agatha could protest.</p><p>"Oh, now that's definitely a power move," Agatha muttered, but her voice was light, teasing. And when Rio extended a hand to help her out, she didn't hesitate to take it.</p><p>"God forbid a girl has class," Rio laughed, squeezing her palm once before leading her toward the entrance. Agatha bit back another comment when Rio jumped forward to open the door for her again.</p><p>A server in a black button-down smiled at them like they'd known each other their whole lives. "Good evening. Do you have a reservation?"</p><p>"Hi, yeah, under Vidal," Rio replied with a smile of her own, her voice smooth and confident.</p><p>The server checked the list quickly and gave a warm nod. "Right this way."</p><p>Agatha followed Rio through the softly lit dining room, eyes darting around the space. It was cozy but upscale - soft jazz floating from overhead speakers, candles flickering low on each table, muted conversations blending with the gentle clink of cutlery and glassware. It was... intimate. The kind of place you took someone to impress them.</p><p>Their table was tucked near a window, the view obscured by gauzy curtains that glowed amber in the fading sunlight. As Agatha slid into her seat across from Rio, she caught herself smoothing her skirt unnecessarily, suddenly aware of every movement and glance.</p><p>Rio reached for the menu but hadn't opened it yet, eyes trained on Agatha. "Having a deja vu?"</p><p>Agatha knew what she was referring to in a heartbeat. "I recall your neckline being lower," she replied without thinking, mentally slapping herself on the forehead. It shouldn't be the first thing she remembered about their dinner months ago, when Wanda had roped her into considering the deal.</p><p>But, God, that fucking blazer haunted her dreams.</p><p>Rio smirked, slow and sly like she hadn't expected anything else. "I can remedy that," she said, toying with the buttons of her shirt. "Just say the word."</p><p>"I don't think this is the kind of place that tolerates partial nudity," Agatha noticed, reaching for her water to fight the sudden dryness in her mouth. Rio was flirting openly now, and even though it was a part of the performance, Agatha felt warmth curl low in her belly.</p><p>She needed to get a fucking grip. Getting the conversation on more neutral grounds seemed like a reasonable first step.</p><p>"Do you know what you're getting?" she asked, keeping her voice steady as she glanced at the menu in front of her.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly catching the shift in tone, but didn't comment on it. Instead, she picked up her menu properly this time and leaned back in her seat. "I'm still deciding. This kind of a decision doesn't come lightly."</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, grateful for the return of normalcy. Or whatever passed for normal between them these days. "Please, like you're getting anything other than pasta with shrimp."</p><p>Rio gave her a narrow-eyed look over the top of the menu. "I have layers. Maybe it's time to branch out."</p><p>"Carbonara, then?"</p><p>Rio clicked her tongue, but her fond smile betrayed her. "You've been paying attention."</p><p>"Being observant is literally in my job description," Agatha shrugged, lifting her water glass again.</p><p>"Alright, Mrs. Lawyer," Rio smirked, putting the menu down and crossing her arms. "You'll get something complicated. Or at least pretend to make the waiter sweat."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, feigning deep consideration. "You're not entirely wrong."</p><p>They fell into a comfortable rhythm then, trading comments on the wine list and quietly mocking the menu's overuse of the word <em>infused</em>. But beneath the banter, Agatha felt a hum of awareness still coiled between them, the kind that made every moment feel like it could tip into something else. Something much more real.</p><p>And when the waiter returned to take their order, Rio gestured for Agatha to speak first, but didn't take her eyes off her the entire time.</p><hr/><p>By the time their food arrived, the restaurant had grown busier, the low murmur of conversations rising enough to blanket their table in a cocoon of ambient noise. The tagliatelle in front of Rio steamed gently, and Agatha's grilled fish was plated with a drizzle of sauce so precise she wondered if it had been measured with a ruler.</p><p>They ate in silence for a while, neither rushing nor speaking, until Agatha realized she'd been staring at her plate for several seconds too long. She couldn't talk about the deal, couldn't bring up the PI or the marriage or anything that actually occupied her mind.</p><p>But the silence was beginning to stretch, and for once, she didn't have a perfectly rehearsed line to pull them out of it.</p><p>Across from her, Rio lifted her fork, then paused as if sensing her mental spiral. "Alright," she said casually, "if you could only eat one meal for the rest of your life - breakfast, lunch, or dinner - what would you pick?"</p><p>Agatha blinked. "What?"</p><p>"You heard me," Rio twirled a strand of pasta with a calculated flick of her wrist. "And no cheating. You pick one and that's it forever. No snacks or switching."</p><p>Agatha gave her a long look. "That's a ridiculous question."</p><p>"It's dinner conversation," Rio grinned. "And be careful. I <em>will</em> judge your answer."</p><p>"It's ridiculous because there's only <em>one </em>correct answer," Agatha argued, cutting a piece of fish.</p><p>"Oh? Care to share with the class?"</p><p>Agatha exhaled a reluctant laugh. "Dinner, obviously."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, feigning deep thought. "Elaborate."</p><p>"It offers the most variety, especially across cultures. You can have something light, rich, hot, or cold. Almost anything qualifies as dinner if you plate it right."</p><p>"Practical. I should've known that's where your brain would go," Rio hummed approvingly. "But no cereal. No pancakes."</p><p>"I think I'll survive," Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>"Yeah, me too," Rio took a sip of her wine, her eyes glinting over the rim. "You passed, by the way."</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. "I wasn't aware I was being tested."</p><p>"Oh, everything's a test," Rio said with a crooked smile. "Especially the important things."</p><p>"And if I'd said breakfast?"</p><p>"I'd have to reevaluate everything I know about you. Possibly walk out."</p><p>Agatha chuckled, shaking her head as she took another bite. "Your priorities are questionable."</p><p>"And yet, here we are." Rio's voice was light, but something underneath it felt real.</p><p>Agatha didn't comment on it.</p><p>"Okay, my turn now," she said instead, earning a surprised lift of Rio's brow. "Who did you want to be as a kid?"</p><p>Rio paused, fork midway to her mouth, then slowly set it down. "What age? I cycled through at least five careers by the time I hit middle school."</p><p>"The first one you remember."</p><p>There was a flicker of something in Rio's expression - hesitation, calculation - before she exhaled through her nose and gave a faint smile. "A firefighter."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly at the unexpected softness in her tone. "What changed your mind?"</p><p>Rio didn't answer right away. She resumed twirling her pasta, not looking up, her posture tightening subtly like she was bracing for impact.</p><p>"The accident that killed my parents," she said finally, her voice lower. "I wanted to help people. That kind of job felt noble, heroic, you know?" She paused, then shrugged as if shaking off an unpleasant feeling. "But the crash... the firefighters were on scene within minutes, and they still couldn't save my parents. It made me realize that sometimes it doesn't matter how fast you get there, you're still too late."</p><p>Agatha felt the words land between them like a dropped stone. She opened her mouth, then closed it again, unsure if any response could touch that kind of grief without feeling hollow.</p><p>But silence didn't feel right either.</p><p>"I owe you an apology," she said at last, her voice quiet but steady. "For what I said about them when you first told me."</p><p>Rio's smile didn't quite reach her eyes. "That was months ago. It's fine."</p><p>"It's not fine," Agatha shook her head, gaze fixed on her plate. "I should've known better. I should've apologized right away. But I didn't. So I'm saying it now - I'm sorry. Truly."</p><p>For a beat, Rio was silent. Then she exhaled slowly and finally looked at her.</p><p>"You didn't know me back then," she said softly. "And your mother had just thrown a live grenade into your life. You were scared. And I know now that you lash out when you feel cornered."</p><p>Agatha blinked, surprised by the accuracy. "That's not an excuse."</p><p>"No," Rio agreed, "but it's a reason. And it means I forgave you a long time ago."</p><p>Something in Agatha's chest uncoiled slightly.</p><p>"Thank you," she murmured.</p><p>Rio gave her a quiet smile, more real this time, then reached for her fork again like she was giving them both a moment to recalibrate.</p><p>"What about you?" She asked after a beat. "I assume you didn't always want to be a lawyer."</p><p>"God no," Agatha chuckled, returning to her meal. "I wanted to be a witch."</p><p>To her surprise, Rio laughed, not mockingly, but with warm, genuine delight. "Seriously?"</p><p>"Dead serious. I couldn't get my hands on spellbooks, so I created my own. Made potions out of shampoo and mud. Even tried to enchant a broom to make it fly."</p><p>"Jesus, that's adorable," Rio giggled, her eyes shining with mirth that somehow made Agatha feel warmer than the wine ever could. "Did it have something to do with being born in Salem?"</p><p>"Oh, definitely," Agatha hummed, slicing a piece of her fish with surgical precision. "It started with the aesthetic, obviously. Long cloaks, ancient tomes, power beyond comprehension." She smiled faintly, a little self-conscious now that she was saying it out loud. "But I think even back then, it wasn't just fantasy. I <em>wanted </em>power. Not the hocus-pocus kind - thought that would've been nice - but the kind that made people pause. That made them listen."</p><p>Rio stayed quiet, watching her.</p><p>"I knew I wanted a 'respectable' job," Agatha went on. "Something that'd make it harder for people to write me off or talk down to me. And, well, I also knew it'd attract some pitchforks and torches. But I wanted that, too. Because it meant I'd done something bold enough to scare people a little."</p><p>Rio let out a soft, thoughtful hum. "So, naturally, you became a lawyer."</p><p>Agatha glanced up, surprised by how neutral Rio's tone was, without an ounce of teasing or judgment, like she was making a simple observation.</p><p>"Well," Agatha said, a touch of humor curling at the edge of her mouth, "it was either that or a cult leader."</p><p>Rio raised her wine glass in a mock salute. "I'd be your most loyal follower."</p><p>Agatha laughed, clinking her glass against hers and taking a slow sip. "I suppose we both ended up with what we wanted. I got the power, and you got to help people."</p><p>"You think very highly of my research," Rio mused, putting her fork on the empty plate. "It's nowhere near helping people yet."</p><p>"But it will be. And that alone is more noble than everything I do."</p><p>Rio gave her a long, unreadable look, like she was trying to decide if Agatha was being earnest or just flattering her. "You say that like being a lawyer doesn't help people."</p><p>Agatha shrugged one shoulder, swirling the last of her wine in its glass. "Not the kind I am. I protect assets. Make sure the rich stay rich, and the powerful stay insulated. Champagne problems."</p><p>"You take pro bono cases," Rio noticed, leaning back in her chair. "You don't <em>have to</em>, but you do. You give people who would never dream of affording a lawyer with your name and track record a shot at being heard."</p><p>Agatha didn't respond right away. She let Rio's words hang there, heavy but not unwelcome. She'd always justified those cases to herself as balance, but hearing Rio acknowledge them, name them as <em>intentional</em>, pulled something loose in her chest.</p><p>"I think you're a better person than you let on," Rio added, her gaze steady. "Maybe even than <em>you </em>think you are."</p><p>The instinctive protest surged up like a reflex. She could feel it, a practiced dismissal meant to protect her from the dangerous terrain of being seen too closely, sharp on her tongue. She'd built an entire career on wearing masks the way other people wore perfume: subtly, expertly, and always by design.</p><p>But Rio wasn't praising a crafted persona.</p><p>She was looking past it, the way she had been from the moment they'd met.</p><p>Agatha's grip tightened around the stem of her glass, her voice catching slightly in her throat. "You're wrong," she said at last, soft but unconvincing. "But... thanks."</p><p>Rio's smile was small but warm, as if she knew better than to push.</p><p>"Well, if you ever start that cult, I need to secure my spot in your inner circle."</p><p>The teasing tone made Agatha's shoulders relax slightly, the tension seeping from her muscles. "You're already in it," she said, softer than she intended.</p><p>Rio didn't say anything, just grinned like it was the best thing she'd ever heard.</p><hr/><p>The conversation flowed, easy and unhurried, interrupted only by the server, who appeared to gather their empty plates and inquire about desserts. They drifted from topic to topic with surprising ease - college horror stories, beloved childhood pets, favorite memories, both funny and bittersweet. Laughter rose and fell between them, warm and unguarded, weaving itself into the quiet clatter of silverware and the distant shuffle of chairs as other diners slowly vacated their tables.</p><p>Over dessert, they found themselves talking about their friends - Wanda, Alice, Jen, Billy - before circling back to Rio's research, Agatha asking thoughtful questions she hadn't planned to ask, and Rio answering with a glint in her eye that made her feel stupid for not asking before.</p><p>When the check came, they did the predictable dance - raised eyebrows, subtle reaches, firm declarations. Agatha tried to win on principle, but Rio did it with sheer stubbornness and a smug little smile that made her want to both argue and laugh.</p><p>Not once did they mention the deal.</p><p>Not once did either of them say anything to make the night feel like an obligation or a strategic move.</p><p>On the contrary, it felt dangerously, undeniably real.</p><p>And Agatha couldn't remember the last time she'd been on a date where she actually indulged in dessert - slowly, deliberately - rather than suggested they skip it and head to the other woman's place. She couldn't remember the last time she'd spent an entire evening without checking her phone, without feeling the tug of work or obligation snapping her attention away.</p><p>She also couldn't remember a date where the prospect of leaving felt like something she wanted to delay. Where the weight in her chest wasn't boredom or disappointment, but something quieter and far more disarming.</p><p>She didn't want it to end.</p><p>But as the server reappeared with Rio's credit card and wished them a good night, Agatha felt reality creeping back in. Their time was up. The spell was breaking.</p><p>She rose from her chair slowly, watching Rio do the same, trying to decipher the guarded stillness in her expression. There was something unreadable in the set of her mouth, in the way her gaze lingered on the table just a second too long.</p><p>Rio's movements weren't hurried either; if anything, they were reluctant, like she, too, was fighting the slow unraveling of something delicate.</p><p>Agatha considered asking if they could keep the night going. Just one more stop. A bar. A walk. Something. The way Rio had after their dinner with Evanora - so casual on the surface, so telling underneath. But the words tangled on her tongue.</p><p>Outside, the cold hit them like a reminder. The restaurant door clicked shut behind them with too much finality, like a judge dropping a gavel.</p><p>Agatha's grip on Rio's hand tightened.</p><p>"Wait, I-" she stared, but faltered when Rio turned to face her.</p><p>The streetlight painted her in soft gold, catching in her dark hair and casting shadows across her face. Her eyes found Agatha's - steady, warm, and waiting.</p><p>There were so many things Agatha wanted to say. That this had been the most peaceful two hours she'd had in months. That Rio made her laugh in a way she hadn't in years. That she didn't want to go back to a version of the night where this had all been pretend.</p><p>But how could she say any of that without giving herself away?</p><p>So instead, she exhaled, her heart once again defeated by her head. "Are you okay to drive? You've had some wine."</p><p>Rio's expression shifted, a flicker of something unreadable crossing her face before she slid a smile into place.</p><p>"I'm great, gorgeous," she said, her tone light but her eyes distant. "Promise not to crash your nice car."</p><p>The pet name landed too softly to be casual. It caught Agatha off guard, sliding beneath her ribs and lodging there, sharp and aching. Her breath hitched. Her feet stayed rooted.</p><p>Then Rio's eyes flicked just past her, over her shoulder, a subtle movement but sharp in its suddenness. Her expression darkened instantly - her jaw clenched, brows narrowing with quick, silent calculation. By the time her eyes returned to Agatha, the change was unmistakable.</p><p>"I'm gonna do something," she murmured, stepping closer. Her voice was low, barely more than a breath, but it rippled through Agatha like a struck chord."Just play along."</p><p>Agatha barely had time to react before Rio's hand was on her cheek and her lips were on hers.</p><p>The kiss wasn't rushed. It wasn't clumsy or uncertain, the way first kisses are often supposed to be. No, this was different. It was precise. <em>Certain</em>.</p><p>Rio kissed her the way she lived: boldly, unapologetically, and with a confidence that shattered through every wall Agatha had spent years building.</p><p>Her touch was steady, fingers feather-light as they curved around Agatha's jaw, just beneath the hinge, like she was anchoring her in place. Her thumb brushed slow, absent strokes across her cheek, grounding and electric all at once. The heat of her palm seeped into Agatha's skin, spreading outward like a spark catching kindling.</p><p>And her lips - God, those fucking lips - were soft and warm, moving with deliberate grace, as though she wanted to memorize the shape of Agatha's mouth. There was no urgency, only reverence. </p><p>Agatha didn't mean to respond, but her body did. It was instinct, reflex, like her muscles had always been wired for this. For <em>her</em>.</p><p>She leaned in with a gasp that caught halfway in her throat, dropping Rio's hand only to grip her waist, pulling her in until there was no space left to give. Their bodies aligned like puzzle pieces snapping together. Rio was heat and curve and strength, and every inch of her pressed against Agatha like an answer to a question she hadn't let herself ask.</p><p>The world narrowed, no, it disappeared. The traffic sounds dimmed into a distant murmur. The cold slipped off her like forgotten clothing. The street, the people, the pretense - all of it fell away under the crush of warmth and the thrumming pull of want low in her belly.</p><p>Rio's other hand tangled in the loose strands that had slipped from Agatha's bun, her nails grazing her scalp with care that sent a shiver down her spine. Agatha let out a low, involuntary sigh, something between a surrender and a plea, and pulled even closer, though there was nowhere left to go.</p><p>And for a heartbeat, maybe two, they just <em>were</em> - together in a suspended breath of time where nothing else mattered.</p><p>Then, somebody behind Agatha cleared their throat, a sharp, deliberate sound loaded with disdain and authority.</p><p>The illusion shattered.</p><p>Rio pulled back slowly, her hands leaving Agatha's face with almost painful reluctance, like peeling something delicate away from skin. The warmth between them dissipated too fast, replaced by a chill that had nothing to do with the night air.</p><p>"I thought I raised you better than this."</p><p>The voice landed like a stone in Agatha's stomach, its coldness impossible to mistake.</p><p>She let go of Rio's waist, her breath catching in her throat as she spun around, heart pounding like it had been yanked from her chest and dropped into ice water.</p><p>"Mother?" she breathed.</p><p>And there she was, Evanora Harkness, standing at the edge of the sidewalk in a midnight-black cold, her silver hair catching the streetlight like frost. Her expression was carved from marble, unreadable except for the faint curl of her lip that Agatha had learned to associate with barely contained disdain.</p><p>Agatha's mind scrambled for logic behind the chance encounter, but there was no mistaking the sharp intelligence in Evanora's eyes.</p><p>She hadn't just stumbled upon them.</p><p>She'd come here to <em>see</em>.</p><p>"Public displays of affection, Agatha?" Evanora clicked her tongue. "How... unbecoming."</p><p>Rio stepped subtly in front of Agatha, a protective hand settling at the small of her back, steady and grounding. "Mrs. Harkness," she said evenly, her voice cool but carrying steel beneath it. "What a surprise. Out for dinner? Or just shadowing your daughter's evening?"</p><p>Evanora hummed, noncommittal, her gaze never leaving Agatha. "Do you truly believe someone of your stature should be caught in such a compromising position, on a public sidewalk, no less?"</p><p>The sting of the words snapped Agatha out of the initial shock. She straightened her spine, chin lifting in defiance as she remembered her role. "I see nothing compromising about kissing my wife while on a date."</p><p>"You see very little these days," Evanora replied, eyes narrowing. "It's a wonder you can carve out time for this little farce when you can't spare a moment for your own mother."</p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened, the muscles twitching. "You seem perfectly up to date on my schedule, regardless."</p><p>"Information and presence are not the same," Evanora said coolly, lips curving just enough to look condescending. "But I wouldn't expect you to understand that."</p><p>Rio's fingers curled slightly against Agatha's back, a silent gesture of support that steadied her against the familiar chill of her mother's manipulation.</p><p>"I don't think you're in the position to talk about presence," Agatha drawled, crossing her arms. "And I don't appreciate you calling my relationship a farce."</p><p>The condescending smile grew as Evanora's eyes flicked between them. "Somebody has to, dear. Since you seem dangerously close to believing an illusion of your own making."</p><p>"That's quite enough," Rio cut in, her voice smooth but razor sharp.</p><p>Evanora turned to look at her with a raised brow. "I don't believe I was addressing you."</p><p>Rio offered a cold smile. "Debatable, considering you're insulting <em>my </em>relationship."</p><p>For a moment, the three of them stood in suspended silence. The air between them crackled as if the confrontation could provoke a storm.</p><p>Evanora's eyes stayed on Rio, sharp with evaluation. "How noble," she said eventually, voice lilting with mock admiration. "So quick to defend something so fragile."</p><p>Rio didn't flinch. "Not fragile. Just not yours to break."</p><p>That landed. Evanora's expression faltered enough for Agatha to notice. And it gave her just enough breath to step forward.</p><p>"You can keep playing this little game," Agatha said, her tone cold but not theatrical. "Keep searching for flaws in one of the only parts of my life that actually brings me peace. But you won't find any."</p><p>She let that sink in.</p><p>"No matter how many investigators you hire, how many surprise appearances you make to test my composure - there's nothing to uncover. Nothing broken, nothing rotting beneath the surface. Just something good that you can't control."</p><p>Her voice remained even, but the edges sharpened. "You're wasting your time. And your money. Because the truth is, you're rather burn my life down than admit I've built something that makes me happy."</p><p>Evanora tilted her head slightly, as if inspecting a flaw in glass only she could see. "Happiness," she echoed, like the word itself tasted unfamiliar. "Such a convenient shield. It's amazing what people will call peace when they've lowered their standards enough."</p><p>Agatha didn't blink.</p><p>"But if you're so content," Evanora continued, "why do you sound like you're still trying to convince <em>yourself</em>?"</p><p>It was a low blow, well-aimed, meant to rattle.</p><p>But Agatha only exhaled through her nose, almost a laugh. "Because I'm used to having to defend my life and the choices I make. Especially from people who should support me."</p><p>There was no indicator that the words had any impact. Evanora's carefully maintained mask remained passive, her eyes vacant like a shark's. But Agatha didn't care. She didn't say it to hurt her mother. She said because she owed it to herself.</p><p>"Very well," Evanora said with a sigh as if she were dealing with an impudent child. "I suppose a mature conversation will have to wait until you get your emotions under control. Expect my call."</p><p>She turned on her heel with a whisper of expensive fabric, her heels clicking against the pavement as she walked away without waiting for an answer.</p><p>Agatha stood still, her breath catching in the silence Evanora left behind. The subtle weight of Rio's hand slid from the small of her back to her hip as the woman stepped into her line of sight, warm brown eyes scanning her face like they could see straight through to the fractures buried beneath the surface.</p><p>As far as encounters with her mother went, this one barely made the list. It wasn't the worst. It wasn't even close to the top ten.</p><p>They had held their ground. They hadn't flinched. They had stood side by side, unwavering in the face of Evanora's well-aimed barbs.</p><p>And yet, the pressure in Agatha's chest didn't come from her mother for once - it came from the woman standing in front of her, from the ghost of a kiss that still lingered on her lips like a question left unsaid.</p><p><em>I'm gonna do something. Just play along</em>.</p><p>The words echoed now, clearer in hindsight than they'd ever been in the moment. She hadn't truly heard them before Evanora arrived or processed their implication. Because up until that point, she'd been floating in the illusion. The deal hadn't existed. The night had felt honest.</p><p>And now, the math finally added up. Rio had kissed her for a calculated reason, not out of want or <em>feeling</em>. And what stopped everything else - every laugh, every glance across the candlelit table, and every gentle touch - from being a part of the same equation?</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The kiss wasn't real, which meant the night probably wasn't either.</p><p>"Agatha?" Rio's voice broke through the fog, soft but edged with nervous humor. "Can you say something so I know you're not catatonic? Blink twice if you're plotting a homicide. Once if it's mine."</p><p>Agatha blinked - twice - and let out a breath that barely resembled a laugh.</p><p>"Not plotting a homicide," she clarified, her voice low. "Just recalibrating."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her fingers still resting lightly against Agatha's hip. The contact burned her skin. "That was a lot. You okay?"</p><p>It was impossible to determine which part of the evening Rio had meant, so Agatha settled for the least complicated one. "You <em>know</em> she's capable of worse," she sighed, rolling her shoulders as if it could ease the tension climbing up her spine from the look in Rio's eyes - worried, still looking at her like she mattered. "This was nothing."</p><p>Rio didn't seem convinced. She studied Agatha for a moment, her eyebrows slightly scrunched in a way that made Agatha want to reach out and smooth the wrinkles out with her fingers.</p><p>"Listen," Rio eventually said, her voice dropping, "I know we haven't discussed... what I did. The kiss. I saw her and reacted without thinking. I should've asked. I should've gotten your consent."</p><p>Agatha blinked, startled by the earnestness in her tone. And the words - <em>fuck</em>, the words - apologizing for a kiss meant to protect them, to keep them both upright under Evanora's scrutiny.</p><p>A joke about the fact that <em>she</em> was the lawyer in this relationship formed on her tongue, ready to lessen the tension.</p><p>But Rio wasn't joking. She wasn't smiling like she was hoping for a teasing remark. Her eyes stayed locked on Agatha's, waiting for something more than silence.</p><p>And for a moment, all Agatha could think was: <em>This is the realest thing I've ever been a part of</em>.</p><p>Even if it wasn't meant to be. Even if it started as a lie.</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet, brittle laugh. "You make it sound like you committed a felony."</p><p>Rio didn't smile.</p><p>"I mean it," she said. "I didn't want to make you uncomfortable."</p><p>"You didn't." Agatha's voice came quicker than she intended. She shoved her hands into her coat pockets, acutely aware of the hand still resting on her hip. Her gaze flicked away to a dimming streetlamp across the road. "You read the moment and reacted accordingly. It worked. It made <em>my mother</em> uncomfortable, which is always a win in my book, and threw her off."</p><p>That earned her a dry, reluctant smirk from Rio, but Agatha didn't look at it. She kept her focus on the empty sidewalk ahead of them, where the world felt safer than the weight of Rio's eyes.</p><p>"Besides," she continued lightly, "I'd rather be kissed than forced to make a run for the car to avoid her."</p><p>Rio tilted her head. "That's your official statement, then?"</p><p>Agatha turned to her with a half-smile that she hoped looked more genuine than it felt. "Absolutely. You acted within the bounds of the contract, counselor."</p><p>The words tasted like ash in her mouth, but she said them anyway. It was easier than saying what the kiss had actually meant for her.</p><p>Easier than admitting it hadn't felt like part of the deal at all.</p><p>"So, we're good?" Rio asked gently, her voice threaded with something careful. "Because you <em>can</em> yell at me for crossing a line. I won't be upset."</p><p>Agatha's smile remained in place, polished and airtight. She even added a soft laugh for good measure, as if that would seal the lie in silk.</p><p>"We're good," she said breezily, forcing herself to meet Rio's eyes. "What's a kiss between friends?"</p><p>She regretted the words the moment they left her mouth, but it was too late to take them back. And Rio's answering smile was just as thin, just as brittle - like maybe she regretted hearing them.</p><p>Agatha crumpled that thought like a used piece of paper and chucked it as far away as possible.</p><p>"Let's go," she added before Rio could reply, grabbing the hand still on her hip and lacing their fingers together. "God knows how much sugar Sharon had already given Nicky."</p><p>She could swear Rio's answering laugh sounded hollow, but didn't dwell on it, guiding them toward the car in brisk, long steps like she could outrun the kiss and its weight.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke up with the kind of headache that came from holding too much in.</p><p>She stared at the ceiling for a long time, eyes open, body still, hoping that if she just didn't move, the memory of Rio's lips wouldn't come back so vividly. But it did, over and over, like her brain was a broken projector capable of showing only one frame.</p><p>She sat up too fast, swinging her legs over the edge of the bed and bracing her hands on her knees. Her mouth was dry. Her heart was loud.</p><p>It was just a stupid kiss.</p><p>Except it wasn't.</p><p>And the worst part? She didn't even know if she was spiraling because it had meant something or because she was scared it hadn't meant anything at all.</p><p>Not that any option was better.</p><p>By the time she made it down to the kitchen, the house smelled of cinnamon toast and coffee. Rio was already there, barefoot in sweats and a T-shirt, her hair damp from a shower, leaning over the stove like nothing earth-shattering had happened between them less than twelve hours ago.</p><p>Agatha hovered in the doorway a beat too long.</p><p>"Mornin'," Rio said without looking up, like she <em>felt</em> her presence.</p><p>Agatha's throat tightened. She forced her feet to move. "Morning."</p><p>She busied herself with the coffee, needing something to do. She could feel Rio's eyes flicking toward her occasionally, like she was waiting for a cue. Or maybe just making sure Agatha was okay. Either way, it created a pit in her stomach. Rio shouldn't have to be careful around her. She shouldn't feel the need to be.</p><p>They were fine. Well, they were <em>supposed</em> to be fine. They were two adults who had agreed to be friends and kissed because of circumstances. The lines remained unchanged.</p><p>Except Agatha felt haunted by the memory of that kiss and all the things it had made her feel. Things she wasn't supposed to want.</p><p>She wrapped her hands around the mug. The silence pressed down on her chest, thick and unwelcome. She didn't have to stay in it. The door was right there. She could walk out and wait for Nicky to come down and fill the space with chatter, jokes, and general noise that would help them feel normal again.</p><p>But leaving would be admitting something was wrong. That something had shifted. And she couldn't do that.</p><p>"Why are you up?" she asked, too sharp, too fast, her voice slicing through the stillness.</p><p>Rio didn't flinch. She moved with practiced ease, pulling plates from a cabinet like this was any other morning. "Couldn't sleep," she said with a small shrug.</p><p>Agatha's grip on the mug tightened. Couldn't sleep. Had she been up thinking about it too? Replaying the kiss? Wondering what it meant - or didn't?</p><p>"I'm sorry to hear that," she offered stiffly.</p><p>Rio froze mid-motion, a plate in one hand, turning to her with raised brows and open disbelief. "What?"</p><p>Agatha frowned. "What?"</p><p>Rio gave a half-laugh, not unkind but disarmed. "You're not usually the 'I'm sorry' type. Especially for something you didn't cause."</p><p>The words stung more than they should have. Maybe because they were true. Maybe because she didn't want them to be.</p><p>Agatha looked away, bristling. "Well, I take it back, then," she snapped, pushing away from the counter, the mug forgotten.</p><p>"Hey - wait."</p><p>She heard the clatter of the plate being set down, then the soft scrape of socked feet against the tile before a warm hand closed gently around her elbow. It wasn't forceful. It didn't need to be - Agatha froze anyway.</p><p>"You okay?" Rio's voice was careful, like she was walking on broken glass.</p><p>Agatha turned halfway, just enough to catch the look on her face: real, open, <em>too much</em>.</p><p>"Why wouldn't I be?" she asked, but it came out uncertain, her voice sounding like a string pulled too tight.</p><p>Rio's hand dropped slowly, retreating without pressure. "You're acting weird."</p><p>Agatha's lips parted, then pressed into a thin line. "So basic human decency is weird now?" she shot back, sharper than intended.</p><p>"Not weird," Rio replied, her eyes softening. "Just... not like you."</p><p>That landed in a strange place in Agatha's chest. Not like you. She didn't know whether it was a comfort or a wound. So, she decided to treat it as an insult.</p><p>"Great," she scowled, crossing her arms over her chest. "Anything else you'd like to say about my personality? Since, apparently, you'd memorized me so thoroughly."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, unfazed by the venom in her voice. "As a matter of fact, yes," she said, meeting Agatha's eyes. "It's something I've already told you, though."</p><p>"Oh, the suspense is killing me," Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>The corners of Rio's mouth curled up slightly. "You lash out when you feel cornered. Or uncertain."</p><p>Agatha's spine straightened, her arms tightening across her chest like armor. She opened her mouth, the rebuttal forming fast - too fast, really - but she swallowed it at the last second.</p><p>Because Rio was right. And worse, she <em>knew</em> she was right.</p><p>"I'm not uncertain," Agatha said finally, her measured voice cutting through the silence stretched between them. "I just don't enjoy being psychoanalyzed before breakfast. Especially after trying to be nice."</p><p>Rio didn't so much as blink. "Fair enough," she relented, calm and unaffected. "But I'm not trying to analyze you. Just... make sure we're alright."</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, trying to hide the slight tremble in her jaw. "We've already talked about it. We're good."</p><p>"Are <em>you</em> good, though?" Rio asked quietly, not backing off. "Because you spent the entire drive back looking like you were about to snap in half, nearly bit Sharon's head off when she asked a harmless question about the date, and..."</p><p>She trailed off.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, arms crossing again. "And what?"</p><p>Rio hesitated, her voice softer now. "And now you have that look in your eye."</p><p>"What look?"</p><p>"The one from your office," Rio said, her voice a little heavier. "From the day you pushed me away."</p><p>Agatha froze. She didn't realize there was a specific <em>look</em> she'd had that day. But she wasn't surprised Rio had noticed and remembered it.</p><p>"You looked just like this then," Rio added, chewing on her lower lip. "Like you thought bolting was the only option."</p><p>The words landed like a blow, gentle in tone but devastating in their truth.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then shut it again, unsure which version of herself she was supposed to let speak. The honest one? The scared one? The one that still tasted the kiss every time she swallowed?</p><p>Finally, she said, "I promised I wouldn't run."</p><p>Rio nodded. "I know. That's why I'm still standing here."</p><p>Silence stretched again, but this time, it wasn't empty. It was tight with everything unspoken. Everything waiting.</p><p>Agatha fixed her gaze on the cupboards above Rio's shoulder, her throat tight. She knew she had to be the one to break the silence, even if the words tasted like denial.</p><p>"Last night was a lot," she said eventually, her voice even. A half-truth delivered like it was a whole story. "I had a great time, and then my mother showed up and..." Her jaw tightened. "She threw me off balance. I hadn't heard from her since the dinner. I wasn't expecting her."</p><p>Rio didn't speak right away, which only made the silence feel heavier. It felt like Rio was waiting for something - maybe for Agatha to either stop pretending or sink fully into the deflection.</p><p>But when the quiet stretched for too long, becoming too thin, Rio nodded. "Yeah. I thought hiring people to spy on us would be enough."</p><p>Agatha huffed a short breath, the closest thing to a laugh she could manage. "Maybe if they'd gotten her the results she wanted. I guess one good thing came out of it."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"She showed us her hand," Agatha clarified, aware that Rio hadn't spent her entire life learning how to read Evanora's moves. "She wouldn't have crashed our night if she had something else to lean on. Ironically, her showing up only played to our advantage."</p><p>She left the 'because you kissed me to sell the lie' unsaid.</p><p>"Right," Rio muttered, sounding unconvinced. There was a strange look in her eyes, but it disappeared before Agatha could decipher it.</p><p>Agatha let it slide. She didn't trust herself to ask. Not when she was still playing defense against her own thoughts.</p><p>"Anyway," she said, leaning her hip against the counter. "I'll keep my ear to the ground. God knows what she'll do next."</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, watching her too closely. "So, calling you is just another move?"</p><p>"Well, I doubt she missed me," Agatha said with a shrug. "She's used to playing the long game, but that won't work here. Not with the time limit. Changing tactics mid-match is her thing."</p><p>Rio didn't comment. She just looked at her again, long enough that Agatha started to squirm under the weight of it, and then she turned back to the stove to resume plating the pieces of toast.</p><p>Agatha stared at her back, feeling something shift. Or maybe settle. Something she didn't want to name.</p><p>"Rio-" she started, but she didn't know what was supposed to come next. An apology for talking about them like their relationship was an elaborate chess game? An assurance that they were truly fine, and that she wasn't going to run again? A confession about how many times she'd replayed the kiss in her head, trying to compartmentalize it and failing every time?</p><p>But Rio saved her from having to fill the space.</p><p>"You know," she said lightly, the sudden shift almost giving Agatha whiplash, "I had a great time, too. And it wasn't just about playing the game."</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched.</p><p>Rio didn't elaborate. She didn't turn around. She just left the words there, hanging in the warm kitchen, half-buried under the crackle of butter and cinnamon.</p><p>Agatha reached for her mug again, afraid that if her hands remained empty, she'd do something stupid like touch Rio's rigid back to soothe the tense muscles.</p><p>A thousand responses flashed through her mind, raging from <em>don't say things like that </em>to <em>then what was it about</em>, but she said none of them. Instead, she took a long sip of coffee that had gone cold and muttered, "The toast better be worth talking about all this at 9 in the morning."</p><p>That earned her a quiet laugh, low and genuine. "Well, like emotional growth, hard conversations are better with something sweet."</p><p>Agatha smiled in spite of herself. And then the moment passed.</p><p>The toast was plated. Nicky came into the kitchen, loud and energetic. They didn't talk about the kiss.</p><p>But it stayed with her - tight in her chest and raw in her throat - long after the dishes were put away.</p><hr/><p>The day unfolded around her as if nothing had changed.</p><p>Nicky chattered nonstop, dragging her from the couch to the kitchen and back again in pursuit of snacks, board games, and a long, meandering story about something that had happened at school two weeks ago. The house was loud, warm, and lived-in: everything it was supposed to be.</p><p>Agatha moved through it on muscle memory, responding with the right hums and nods, smiling at the right moments. She even laughed once, startled by a particularly dramatic retelling of a practice scandal. But there was a dull pressure behind her ribs that wouldn't ease.</p><p>Rio had left soon after breakfast to meet with Alice and Billy, and every so often, Agatha caught herself glancing toward the hallway.</p><p>It was absurd. Being around Rio felt taxing, both emotionally and physically, and Agatha should welcome the short reprieve, not stare at the front door like a doting wife waiting for her spouse to return home.</p><p>Still, even in Rio's absence, her mind was consumed by the woman - by every lingering gaze, every soft laugh, and, of course, <em>the kiss</em>.</p><p>The kiss that wasn't supposed to mean anything.</p><p>The kiss that she terrifyingly wanted to mean <em>everything</em>.</p><p>
<em>What's a kiss between friends?</em>
</p><p>It had been the appropriate thing to say, something to ease the tension they had been swimming in while Rio looked at her like she was something fragile.</p><p>But Agatha wasn't the type to kiss her friends.</p><p>Jesus, she still stiffened whenever Wanda <em>hugged her</em>.</p><p>Affection had never come naturally to her, not because she didn't want it, but because she'd never learned how to receive it. She hadn't grown up in a household where love was spoken in soft touches or warm embraces. Love in the Harkness family - if it could even be called that - had been cold and transactional. Something to be earned, not freely given. Something to survive, not to bask in.</p><p>So she'd taught herself how to live without it. Without comfort. Without touch. Without the aching tenderness of someone choosing to be close just because.</p><p>It resulted in building compartments - clinical boxes where longing could be filed away, starved of air, and left to die without making a fuss.</p><p>Except Rio had always refused to stay in those boxes.</p><p>Before she'd redrawn the line, before she'd panicked and pulled away, Agatha had caught herself leaning toward her in small, dangerous moments. Moments she dismissed too quickly. Rio offered affection with ease, back then - casual touches, shoulder nudges, the playful bump of a knee beneath the table like a secret only they shared. At the time, Agatha convinced herself it was harmless.</p><p>In hindsight, she remembered how her skin had thrummed beneath each touch. How she'd started anticipating them. <em>Craving</em> them.</p><p>She hadn't let herself think about the implications. Not really. She'd kept her head above water by pretending it was all incidental.</p><p>After their fallout, there hadn't been any space left for that kind of yearning. The silence between them had been loud enough to drown everything else out. And even though the longing hadn't disappeared, Agatha refused to acknowledge it. Not when she couldn't even talk to Rio, let alone brush against her shoulder and pretend it didn't mean anything.</p><p>Then they'd agreed to be friends, and Rio, ever respectful, hadn't offered casual affection anymore. Not unless someone was watching. Every hand on Agatha's back or brush of fingers had been for show. None of it lingered.</p><p>And still, Agatha felt it - the pull, the <em>need</em>.</p><p>She kept trying to shove the feelings back into their assigned boxes, hoping that blaming them on proximity, performance, or sheer loneliness would be enough to smother them.</p><p>Now, as she sat in her favorite chair in the living room, an unopened book in her lap, she knew those feelings weren't a byproduct of anything.</p><p>She could pretend that her analysis of every moment of the kiss wasn't disguising an obsession.</p><p>She could wrap her denial in logic and try to move on.</p><p>But one truth poked through it all, heavy and undeniable: she <em>wanted </em>Rio.</p><p>Not just physically, though God knew that kiss had left a fucking burn.</p><p>She wanted her laughter in the kitchen and her tired sighs at night, and her stupid speaker on the counter. She wanted <em>all of it</em>.</p><p>And it scared the hell out of her.</p><p>Because, despite not having many friends, Agatha knew that kind of yearning didn't fit within the bounds of a platonic relationship.</p><p>Friends didn't ache like this.</p><p>Friends didn't dream about falling asleep with someone's heartbeat under their palm, or wonder if cinnamon toast would taste different if Rio fed it to her while laughing against her neck.</p><p>Her friendship with Rio had been built on shaky ground from the beginning, and Agatha knew that. But compartmentalizing had always been her specialty, and feelings tended to go away if she didn't look at them long enough.</p><p>Except everything concerning Rio seemed to grow instead of withering whenever she hadn't paid attention to it.</p><p>Her feelings, she realized, were like that fucking plant Rio had given Nicky right after moving in. No matter how much she ignored them, they thrived, spreading through the shadowy corners of her mind in search of light.</p><p>It didn't make sense. She'd neglected them. Starved them. Pretended they were nothing more than static noise beneath the louder mechanics of her day-to-day life. But still, they bloomed. Persistent and inconvenient. Watered by the odd touch or a nice word.</p><p>She had told herself that Rio was kind to everyone. That the warmth in her touch was just part of the performance. That the way she looked at Agatha like she wanted to memorize her didn't mean anything.</p><p>But no one looked at her like that. Not without wanting something in return.</p><p>And that - more than the kiss, more than the fact that she'd kissed back without hesitation - was the part she couldn't wrap her head around.</p><p>Because even if, by some miracle, Rio wanted her too... then what?</p><p>What would she do with someone who saw past the sharp edges and chose to stay? How long until she drove her away with all the things she didn't know how to say?</p><p>Agatha had survived her life by holding people at arm's length. She knew how to manage disappointment. How to rebuild after people left. It was wanting that made her reckless.</p><p>And Rio made her want <em>so much</em>.</p><p>She picked at the book in her lap, lifting and dropping the front cover so the soft thuds could fill the silence.</p><p>If she thought developing a crush on Rio had been damning, whatever feelings were now simmering under her skin were a death sentence.</p><p>Because she didn't just want Rio.</p><p>She wanted to be wanted by her.</p><p>And even without everything else between them, even if they were just two strangers unburdened by contracts and promises, that was the one thing she'd never learned how to believe she deserved.</p><p>The buzzing of her phone on the coffee table almost made her jump out of her seat. Her eyes snapped to the screen, heart pounding. The last thing she needed was a conversation with her mother.</p><p>But one look at the caller ID drained the tension from her muscles.</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>Agatha sighed and accepted the call. "What?"</p><p>"Charming," Wanda deadpanned. "Care to explain why you've been ignoring my texts?"</p><p>"Not ignoring. I just don't live with my phone glued to my hand," Agatha grumbled, staring at the book in her lap. "I've been relaxing, actually. Reading."</p><p>"Yeah? Reading what?"</p><p>"A book about..." Agatha quickly turned the book to skim the back for a summary. She held back a groan when she saw five reviews from random authors and newspapers instead. "You know what? I won't spoil it for you."</p><p>"Jesus, you're so full of shit," Wanda chuckled. "Been thinking about the date?"</p><p>Agatha leaned further into the couch, fixing her gaze on the ceiling. "I'm not in the mood for an interrogation. I've had a long day."</p><p>"It's barely two."</p><p>"I started it at five," she muttered, dragging a finger down the armrest. "Don't be technical."</p><p>Wanda didn't respond right away. There was some shuffling on her end, the sound of a cupboard slamming shut, and a disgruntled shout from one of the twins. "Vis, I'm on the phone, can you?"</p><p>"Yeah, I'm on it," Vision's voice came from further back, and then the background noise cut off with the click of a shutting door.</p><p>"You okay?"</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw. She really wished people would stop asking her that. "I'm fine."</p><p>A long pause. Long enough to feel pointed.</p><p>"Right," Wanda said flatly. "Because 'fine' is how you sound. And not at all like you've been pacing around in your head like a caged animal."</p><p>Agatha let her eyes fall shut. "I hate you."</p><p>"You wish you did," Wanda replied easily, warmth threading through the teasing. "Come on. Talk to me."</p><p>There was a long silence while Agatha wondered if hanging up would have any consequences. She dismissed the idea. Wanda wouldn't be above barging into her house in twenty minutes and tying her to the chair until she fessed up.</p><p>"I don't know what to say," Agatha admitted, the words dragged out of her like splinters. "Everything's a mess in my head. It was supposed to be simple."</p><p>"Define simple," Wanda said gently.</p><p>"I picked a stranger to avoid this. To keep things separate. I expected it to be difficult, an adjustment, but not-" she cut herself off and pinched the bridge of her nose. "Feelings weren't supposed to happen. <em>Rio</em> wasn't supposed to happen."</p><p>"Ags, you've known about your feelings for over a month," Wanda noticed carefully. "Why are you spiraling <em>now</em>?"</p><p>Agatha let out a humorless laugh, raw around the edges. "Because I can't shut them off! And nothing helps. I tried pushing her away, and it only made me miss her more. I see her in the kitchen, and my brain short-circuits. I'm supposed to be her friend, Wanda. But all I can think about is how she <em>tastes</em>."</p><p>Her voice cracked, brittle with the weight of her own confession. "And it's not like she's helping, either. She kissed me on the date because she saw my mother. It was part of the act. I know that. But then this morning she said it <em>wasn't </em>about playing the game, and I- I don't know what to do with that."</p><p>"Agatha," Wanda interrupted firmly, "breathe."</p><p>Agatha hadn't even realized she'd started pacing until that moment. Her lungs burned, her fingers were curled into fists.</p><p>Wanda continued. "Let's back up. You said she kissed you?"</p><p>Agatha sank back onto the chair like someone had cut the strings holding her up. "Yes, when she noticed my mother on the sidewalk. She reached for me, and I didn't even think about the deal at first. But she told me to play along right before the kiss, so I just... tried to dismiss it as another move."</p><p>"And this morning?"</p><p>"She made cinnamon toast. Like that would undo it," Agatha muttered. "And then she said she had a great time on the date. That it wasn't just about playing the game. But she didn't <em>explain</em>. She just dropped it like a grenade and moved on. And now she's with Alice and Billy, and I can't think straight, and my skin feels too tight."</p><p>Wanda stayed quiet for a moment, the gears in her head turning almost audibly.</p><p>"You sound like someone who's afraid of being wanted," she finally said, making Agatha's jaw drop.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Look, you've convinced yourself that the kiss wasn't supposed to mean anything. But deep down, you <em>wanted</em> it to mean something. You still do. And the part of you that doesn't think you deserve that? That's the part screaming the loudest right now."</p><p>"It's not about deserving," Agatha snapped, too fast and too defensive. Her fingers tightened around the phone, the plastic case whining pitifully under the pressure. "It doesn't matter what I deserve or want. We've still got eight months left in the deal. That's eight months of living together. Of pretending. Wanting is-" her voice dipped into a growl. "Wanting is <em>dangerous.</em>"</p><p>"You wanting her," Wanda said carefully, "or her wanting you?"</p><p>Agatha's throat locked up. Her breath stalled.</p><p>"Both," she admitted after a beat, bitter and reluctant. "And it's not like I know Rio even <em>wants </em>me. She could've said that to defuse tension. To be kind."</p><p>"Or," Wanda countered gently, "she could've said it because she genuinely likes you. Because she meant it."</p><p>"We're friends. Enjoying spending time together is kind of the point."</p><p>"No, Agatha," Wanda's voice lost its patience, not quite angry but brutally honest. "You and I are friends. What you and Rio have has never been just friendship. Not from the start. And you <em>know</em> that."</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, like that would block out the words, the truth pressing down on her chest. Her eyes drifted to the ceiling again, finding the crack she'd traced with her gaze a hundred times before. It looked wider now.</p><p>"It doesn't matter," she said eventually. "The deal's too important for both of us to jeopardize it."</p><p>"Wouldn't <em>actually </em>being together make the pretending easier?"</p><p>Agatha almost laughed. It came out as a sigh instead.</p><p>Maybe it would, for someone else. For someone who didn't come with a rusted-over heart and a history of loving wrong. Maybe it would work for someone who didn't constantly brace for disappointment. Someone who hadn't spent their whole life avoiding touch, only to find herself craving it now from the one person she couldn't safely want.</p><p>Maybe if Agatha were a different person - softer, simpler, riddled with fewer cracks - this could be something.</p><p>But she wasn't.</p><p>"No," she whispered. "Not in the long run."</p><p>Wanda sighed again, the old blend of sympathy and exasperation only best friends could master. There was a pause, and then her voice softened with intent.</p><p>"You know why I backed Vision when he said Rio should take the coaching position?"</p><p>Agatha hummed, tired. "Because you take soccer too seriously and Rio's the perfect candidate?"</p><p>"No." Wanda hesitated. "I mean, sure, she'd be amazing. But the truth is... I forgot. I <em>forgot</em> you two weren't actually together."</p><p>Agatha snorted. "I'll pass that on. I'm sure she'll be thrilled to hear we're that convincing."</p><p>"You're not listening," Wanda groaned. "I forgot because I've never seen you that comfortable with someone. And I've known you almost your entire adult life. I saw you go through that doomed senior year situationship, through the Icelandic artist phase-"</p><p>"That was one time-"</p><p>"-through the whole 'no one touch me unless you want to lose a limb' era. And still, I've never seen you look at someone the way you look at her. Like you'd give her the moon without her asking. Like you'd dig it out of the sky with your bare hands if she needed it."</p><p>Agatha's breath caught. She didn't answer.</p><p>"And here's the part I need you to hear," Wanda said, gentler now but unwavering. "She looks at you the <em>exact</em> same way. You can twist it however you want to protect yourself, but I know what I saw. She <em>wants</em> you. Nobody's <em>that</em> good at acting."</p><p>Agatha's grip on the phone loosened just slightly. The silence stretched again, thick and full of something old and aching.</p><p>"And," Wanda added, her voice almost tender, "if you gave it a shot? I think it'd work. Not just until the deal ends. I mean past that. All the way."</p><p>Agatha didn't answer right away. She mulled over the words, barely registering the sounds of Wanda shifting slightly on the other end of the line, waiting.</p><p>Finally, Agatha exhaled through her nose. "It's not worth the risk. I know I told you you're all-knowing, but you're not. You could be wrong. And if I let myself- if I let this be something, and she doesn't feel the same way, I lose everything. Nicky loses her. That's not a gamble I get to make."</p><p>"Won't Nicky lose her either way? Won't you?"</p><p>"Not if I stay friends with her after the deal ends."</p><p>"Will you go for her then? When the deal's not in the picture anymore?"</p><p>Agatha hesitated. She had thought about it. She imagined surviving the next eight months with her feelings shoved into boxes too small to fit them and masked behind domestic routines. She'd imagined waiting until the ink dried on their divorce papers and the pressure was off. She'd imagined taking a breath and then finally asking Rio if they could try for something real.</p><p>But there was no guarantee Rio would want that, want <em>her</em>.</p><p>And more than that, there were the optics. The whispers.</p><p>To the outside world, it would look suspicious. Divorcing someone and staying friends with them was one thing, but divorcing someone to start dating them immediately after? The rumor mill would spin out of control.</p><p>Not to mention her mother, who would instantly suspect foul play and do everything in her power to discredit Agatha's claim over the inheritance. Everything would turn into an uncontrollable spectacle, and they would never be free of the deal hanging over them. Not really.</p><p>And worst of all, if Rio <em>did</em> say no, there'd be nothing to fall back on. No contracts to keep them close or encourage them to stay friends.</p><p>She'd lose her for good.</p><p>"No," she said eventually, her voice tight. "It'd look messy to everyone. Staying friends is the best outcome."</p><p>Wanda was quiet for a beat, letting the words fester.</p><p>Then, she spoke again, gently, "You keep saying the deal's the reason you can't risk it, but you won't try anything even after it's gone."</p><p>Agatha blinked, opened her mouth, then closed it again. The comment sat between them, simple and undeniable.</p><p>"What if the truth is that you're scared?" Wanda continued, voice void of judgment. "Not just of messing things up, but of being loved. The real way. Without conditions or an exit plan. Just someone choosing you, over and over."</p><p>Agatha let her head fall back against the chair, eyes stinging.</p><p>"That's not-" she started, but couldn't find the rest of the sentence. She swallowed hard. "People don't <em>choose</em> me, Wands. They're stuck with me."</p><p>"I think Rio would choose you," Wanda said. "But you'd have to give her a chance to do it."</p><p>Agatha didn't respond. Couldn't. Her throat was too tight, her chest too full of things she didn't have the courage to name.</p><p>The idea of someone choosing her, wanting her not out of obligation or necessity, but because they simply <em>did</em>, felt like trying to touch sunlight. Beautiful but intangible. A bit dangerous.</p><p>She wiped at her eyes, annoyed to find them wet. "I have to go."</p><p>Wanda didn't argue. She just sighed, gentle and knowing. "Alright. But promise me something?"</p><p>"Depends on what it is."</p><p>"Let yourself want and be wanted. Stop convincing yourself you're unlovable just because it's easier than being hurt."</p><p>Agatha was too tired to fight. "I'll try," she mumbled.</p><p>Wanda seemed to accept that. "Good. Now go do something that doesn't involve sitting in the dark and brooding. The weather's nice, take Nicky to the park. And drink some water."</p><p>Agatha huffed out a sound that sounded more like a choked sob than a laugh. "Thanks, mom."</p><p>"Anytime."</p><p>The call ended, and Agatha sat there for a while longer, phone cradled in her lap like it held something fragile. Eventually, she stood, slowly, like the weight of the conversation had settled into her bones.</p><p>Her gaze flicked to the hallway. The house felt too quiet, too tight. Like the walls were closing in, echoing with what had just been said, and what hadn't been said at all.</p><p>She needed air. Not just metaphorical space, but real, wide, breathable air.</p><p>The park was a good idea, but she knew her mind was too occupied to split her attention between Nicky and the emotional spiral. And she couldn't exactly leave him unattended at the house or call Sharon to watch him while she tried to outrun her thoughts.</p><p>A compromise, then.</p><p>Agatha padded up the stairs and knocked gently on his door. "Nicky?"</p><p>"Yeah?" came the quick reply, muffled through the wood and the soft hum of his video game.</p><p>"I'm going to sit out back for a bit, okay? I'll have my phone."</p><p>"'Kay."</p><p>She waited a beat, but he didn't say anything else. Whatever game he was playing had him immersed. That was fine. She just needed a moment.</p><p>Agatha stepped onto the back patio, letting the screen door click softly behind her. The early afternoon sun stretched long shadows across the grass, and a faint breeze tugged at the edge of her shirt.</p><p>Averting her gaze from the two raised beds tucked a few paces away from the porch, she sank into one of the chairs and tipped her head back, letting her eyes fall shut.</p><p>Still, even under the open sky and with fresh air in her lungs, the memory of Wanda's voice lingered.</p><p>
<em>Stop convincing yourself you're unlovable.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I think Rio would choose you. But you'd have to give her a chance to do it.</em>
</p><p>Agatha pressed the heels of her hands to her eyes. "<em>Fuck</em>."</p><hr/><p>The creak of the screen door startled her. Agatha blinked, head jerking slightly as her gaze tore away from the raised beds she'd been staring at so long she could trace the shape of every pole holding up the tomatoes and the drooping basil leaves in her mind. She had no idea how much time had passed, but it was long enough for the light to shift across the yard.</p><p>When she turned her head, something in her spine popped, sharp and unwelcome. She winced, her hand flying up to rub at the back of her stiff neck. And then her eyes met Rio's.</p><p>"I have to say, this is the last place I expected to find you," Rio said, pulling the screen door shut behind her with a soft click. Her smile was small, curious.</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows, fingers still kneading the sore muscle at the base of her skull. "Were you searching for me?"</p><p>"Not in a 'there's an emergency and only you can help' kind of way," Rio said, stepping forward and leaning casually against the porch railing, her arms folded loosely across her chest. "I just walked around. Didn't find you. And... I don't know. I figured."</p><p>Agatha turned her head back toward the raised beds, her hand dropping to drum her fingers against the wooden armrest. "You thought I ran."</p><p>"Not exactly," Rio said, her voice gentler. "But, yeah... for a second, it crossed my mind."</p><p>Agatha gave a dry huff. "I hope you know I'd at least take Nicky with me."</p><p>"That was actually my first clue you were still around," Rio admitted with a faint smile.</p><p>There was a beat of silence, broken only by the far-off chirping of birds and the rustle of breeze in the leaves. Rio looked out toward the garden, then back at Agatha.</p><p>"And here you are. In the garden," she said, her voice light, almost teasing.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "You say it like I'm allergic to fresh air."</p><p>"I mean..." Rio tilted her head in fake consideration. "You never come out here when Nicky and I are outside. I kind of assumed the sun offended you somehow."</p><p>It wasn't said unkindly. If anything, it sounded like Rio was trying to coax a smile out of her. But Agatha felt the words like a small, sharp stone dropped straight into her stomach.</p><p>Because Rio wasn't wrong.</p><p>Since the evening she'd come home to find them crouched side-by-side, hands in the dirt and laughing like they'd been doing it for years, Agatha had stayed away. She told herself she had work, chores, and something else always needing her attention. She told Nicky she was happy for his newfound passion for the garden, but gently emphasized that she did not share it. But the truth was simpler and harder to name: it hadn't felt like a place she belonged.</p><p>The garden was theirs - Rio's and Nicky's. It was something they built with laughter and warmth, with long days and muddy knees and shared purpose. And Agatha, well, Agatha didn't know how to step into something that didn't feel hers without breaking it.</p><p>So instead, she watched. From the kitchen window, through the blinds. She watched Rio wipe sweat from her brow with the back of her arm, and Nicky jabber on about worm colonies and root systems, and she told herself she didn't want to intrude.</p><p>But the truth was, she didn't want to taint it.</p><p>Rio always looked so alive out here, like nothing weighed her down. Like the world, at least in that one patch of soil, was something she could shape into beauty with her bare hands.</p><p>And Agatha wasn't beauty. She'd almost ripped the joy of working together in the garden from them when she'd redrawn the line and made Rio feel unwelcome in one of the few spaces that brought her complete peace in the house. Rio deserved a sanctuary, a place where she could laugh freely and smile brightly.</p><p>A place without a walking reminder of what she'd gotten herself into.</p><p>So Agatha stayed inside. She ignored all the thoughts urging her to join in the laughter punctuated with sweat and dirt, and pretended she didn't want to be a part of it. She avoided the garden altogether.</p><p>Until today.</p><p>And now Rio was watching her, head tilted slightly, like she could hear every thought running silently through Agatha's mind.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath, low and quiet. "It's peaceful out here," she offered. It was a small truth. Easier than the bigger one.</p><p>Rio's eyes softened. "Yeah," she said. "It is."</p><p>Another beat passed, but the silence was easier now. Rio didn't press. She didn't ask why Agatha was really sitting here today, or what the expression on her face meant, or whether she'd been crying earlier when her eyes had looked red-rimmed and far away.</p><p>Instead, she looked out at the beds, then back at Agatha, her fingers curling slightly around the edge of the railing.</p><p>"You know," Rio said slowly, "I've been thinking about adding another one. Well, maybe two."</p><p>Agatha's breath caught slightly in her lungs. Her gaze flicked instinctively to the garden before returning to Rio, searching her face for something she couldn't name.</p><p>She remembered overhearing Rio talking to Nicky a few weeks ago - soft, practical, resigned - about not expanding the garden. About how it had been too late in the season, and their work wouldn't pay off.</p><p>But Agatha had checked. She'd pulled out her phone later that night in bed and Googled planting calendars until the screen blurred. It wasn't too late. It wasn't even close.</p><p>Rio had lied. She hadn't said no to more vegetables but to more roots. More permanence. More <em>them</em>.</p><p>At the time, Agatha couldn't blame her. She'd made the transactional nature of their arrangement clear. She'd voluntarily tainted the soil so nothing else could grow.</p><p>And now...</p><p>The shift felt like sunlight sneaking through a crack in the blinds - small but real.</p><p>Agatha realized too late that she hadn't responded, the silence stretching long enough to feel awkward. She cleared her throat. "That's great," she said, her voice too even, too careful. "But you don't need my permission. I gave you free rein, remember?"</p><p>"I know," Rio said, a smile tugging at her lips. "I'm not asking for a blessing."</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly. "Then what are you asking for?"</p><p>Rio's smile widened then, easy and bright, that familiar gap between her front teeth making something warm press up behind Agatha's ribs.</p><p>"Free labor."</p><p>Agatha blinked, then let out a short, startled laugh. "That's what this is? A pitch?"</p><p>"More of a recruitment drive," Rio corrected, grinning now. "I figured your defenses would be lower if you were already outside."</p><p>"Ah, so you were hoping some emotional manipulation would be enough to convince me to roll around in dirt?"</p><p>"Rolling is-"</p><p>"Not required but encouraged," Agatha finished the sentence, her voice growing softer. "Yeah, I remember."</p><p>Their eyes met, something crackling beneath the surface, sending a shiver down Agatha's spine like an electric shock.</p><p>"Good," Rio said just as softly. "Then you know the most important rule already. The rest will be easy."</p><p>Agatha's mouth twitched like she wanted to smile, but couldn't quite give in to it. Not fully. She looked away first, gaze flicking down to her fingers drumming against the armrest like they needed something to do. The movement made the soft sunlight bounce off her wedding ring.</p><p>"I'm not exactly great at easy," she murmured.</p><p>The wood of the porch creaked as Rio shifted her weight against the railing, the hush of the neighborhood around them almost reverent in its stillness.</p><p>"That's okay," she said after a moment. "We don't have to do easy. We can do stubborn. Or cautious. Or whatever version doesn't scare you off."</p><p>Agatha glanced at her again, a little surprised at the choice of words. "You think I'm scared?"</p><p>"I think," Rio started gently, "you're used to people walking away. So you like to get there first."</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly, lips parting as if she might deny it. She didn't. She couldn't fight when the clarity with which Rio saw her made her breath catch in her throat. She couldn't push back against the words that clearly weren't just about working in the garden.</p><p>Instead, her voice came out thin. "You're on a roll today."</p><p>"It's not about psychoanalyzing you," Rio said. "I just want you to know that... I see you. That's all."</p><p>The words appeared in her mind, scribbled on a crumpled napkin in black pen.</p><p>
<em>Te veo.</em>
</p><p>Back then, they hadn't made sense. Agatha had dismissed them as one of Rio's many quirks she'd come to ignore. She hadn't paid attention to the phrase whenever Rio used it at the end of a phone call or before leaving the house.</p><p>But now, they felt real, tangible, like a touch of a hand on bare skin.</p><p>They felt like understanding.</p><p>"So what," Agatha said, tone bordering on sharp but not quite defensive, "you see all my bad habits and want to build garden beds with me anyway?"</p><p>Rio smiled again, less brightly but more deeply.</p><p>"Yeah," she said. "That's exactly what I want."</p><p>
<em>Let yourself want and be wanted.</em>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed as Wanda's words echoed in her mind. Her throat felt tight, and the heat behind her eyes made her blink hard once, then twice. She looked at the garden again, the soft green reaching out of the soil like it trusted the world would take care of it.</p><p>"You know I'll be bad at it," she said, trying for wry because giving in felt like defeat. No matter what her heart wanted.</p><p>"I'll teach you."</p><p>Agatha looked back at her. "Even if I roll my eyes and scoff the whole time?"</p><p>"Especially then," Rio said, smiling like it didn't matter. "I'll still know you're enjoying it."</p><p>Agatha let out a huff that sounded almost like a chuckle. "That's a bold assumption."</p><p>"The world could use some boldness," Rio replied, stepping closer, not enough to crowd but enough to make her presence unmistakable. The gravity in her eyes made Agatha lean forward, just a small shift as if she couldn't help but want to be closer.</p><p>They stayed like that for another moment, long enough for the silence to stretch again, still charged but not strained. Weighed by something Agatha couldn't name.</p><p>Finally, she rose to her feet, brushing imaginary dust from her pants and tearing her eyes from the magnetic pull of Rio's gaze.</p><p>"Alright," she said, steadying herself. "When do you want to start?"</p><p>Rio's smile turned crooked, almost triumphant. "Tomorrow. We can get the supplies on the way back from Nicky's game. Make a day of it."</p><p>
<em>Make a day of it.</em>
</p><p>Agatha knew what that meant. Not merely errands and dirt, but togetherness. It meant laughter between tasks, maybe an accidental brush of shoulders, maybe Rio handing her a water bottle with that easy smile. It meant something soft and whole and dangerous.</p><p>They would spend that day like a family, building something living, something that might still be blooming long after they weren't.</p><p>Agatha pushed the thought down before it could develop. Now wasn't the time for spiraling. Rio was offering her a moment. A bridge.</p><p>And for once, urged by Wanda's words, Agatha chose to cross it.</p><p>"Sounds good," she said, her voice steady despite the fluttering in her chest. "But you're doing all the heavy lifting. I am <em>not</em> throwing out my back slaving in my own garden."</p><p>Rio let out a delighted laugh like the words had taken her by surprise. "I solemnly swear to provide you the highest tier of princess treatment while you're elbow-deep in compost," she said, making a lazy cross over her heart with her thumb.</p><p>Agatha wrinkled her nose. "I'm also not touching compost."</p><p>"We'll see," Rio mused, the sparkle in her eye unmistakably teasing. She turned her gaze toward the raised beds, her voice softening. "I suppose that means you won't help me water everything, either?"</p><p>"Don't get ahead of yourself," Agatha shot back, but the words lacked bite. Her voice was warmer now, her heart looser. She followed Rio's gaze for a moment, then glanced at her watch, surprised by the time. "I should get started on dinner. It's a miracle Nicky hasn't come out here looking for me."</p><p>Rio lifted a hand sheepishly, brushing the back of her neck. "I, uh... may or may not have told him you needed some me time. Then bribed him with four rounds of Mario Kart to keep him distracted."</p><p>Agatha blinked. "You bribed a ten-year-old to preserve my mental health? You didn't even know where I was."</p><p>Or how much I was spiraling, Agatha added silently.</p><p>Rio shrugged, grinning again. "I do what I can for the people I care about."</p><p>The words sat there, simple and unrushed. Not a declaration, but something adjacent to it. Something warm.</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a moment longer, something tight in her chest loosening. Then she nodded once, slowly. "Thanks," she murmured.</p><p>"Anytime," Rio smiled, her voice genuine. "You can tell him to join me out here. I have something I wanna show him in the tomatoes."</p><p>Agatha nodded, and when she walked through the screen door and left it open behind her, it wasn't a retreat. It felt - just barely - like a beginning.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The next day fell into rhythm with startling ease.</p><p>They moved through the motions like they'd done it a hundred times before: showing to the game in identical jerseys, Rio yelling at the ref from the bleachers, Nicky charging up and down the field like he had endless reserves of energy, and Agatha trying to ignore Wanda as she watched them like she was collecting evidence for court.</p><p>Rio's arm draped across her backrest again, casual but solid, brushing against her spine every time she leaned forward to shout encouragement or groan at an offside call. And each time, Agatha told herself to act normal. To pretend her skin wasn't on fire from such a simple point of contact.</p><p>It was only the second time they'd gone to one of Nicky's games together, but it already felt like something familiar. Something practiced. It should have terrified her.</p><p>And maybe it still did.</p><p>But she was there, letting it happen, choosing to be present not because she felt brave, but because Wanda's words still circled her like a moth around a light.</p><p>
<em>Let yourself want and be wanted.</em>
</p><p>She knew Wanda had said more. Something about not convincing herself she was unlovable to prevent getting hurt. But Rome wasn't built in a day, nor were the walls around Agatha's heart. It would take more than a pep talk from her best friend to tear them down.</p><p>Still, she was trying, and letting herself want felt like a good start.</p><p>When they stopped for pizza after the game, she took the chair beside Rio's, not out of obligation but because she wanted to. She let Rio lean in close to joke with Wanda, even when her hair brushed Agatha's cheek. She let herself stay in the moment, even when her heart thudded against her ribs like it was trying to punch its way out.</p><p>The kiss still lived in the back of her mind like a memory and a dare. It wasn't fading, not like other moments did, blurring at the edges with time or repetition. No, this one had lodged itself deeper, coiled around the base of her spine, and humming.</p><p>It pressed into Agatha when she wasn't looking, in the quiet moments when her mind felt numb from the repetitive motions of brushing her teeth or folding laundry. It was present in the way Rio's hand had lingered just a second too long after handing her a coffee that morning. In the way neither of them had spoken about it, unsure of what to say.</p><p>It hadn't felt like a mistake. That was the problem. If it had been clumsy or regrettable, she could have buried it. But it hadn't been any of those things.</p><p>It had been soft. Intentional. Too familiar to dismiss and full of something Agatha had spent years pretending she didn't want - tenderness, desire, <em>hope</em>.</p><p>And now it pulsed quietly under her skin like a second heartbeat.</p><p>The weight hadn't lessened - it had just started to settle. Like a stone in water, not gone, but no longer thrashing on the surface. The ripples still moved outward, slow and wide, disturbing everything in their wake.</p><p>The unease should've sent her running for the hills with a lousy excuse to mask her cracking walls, to stop the water from moving. But she'd promised Rio that she wouldn't run, and she owed it to both of them to at least try staying.</p><p>So when Rio turned to her on the way to the car and asked if she was still up for the garden, Agatha didn't deflect. She didn't pretend she'd suddenly remembered a deadline or fake a phone call from a client.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>
<em>Let yourself want and be wanted.</em>
</p><p>It echoed in the back of her mind like a mantra. Not loud, but persistent, the kind of truth that made her chest ache because it asked something of her. Something she wasn't used to giving.</p><p>This was the first step.</p><p>She wanted to be there, in the sun, in the dirt, shoulder to shoulder with Rio and Nicky, building something that would last longer than the day. Something that could, maybe, outlast the contract, too. She wanted to feel like she was a part of it, that she belonged in the corners of Rio's life where things grew.</p><p>And, more importantly, Rio had <em>asked</em>. She'd invited Agatha in, offering her a place somewhere Agatha didn't think she'd belong.</p><p>That meant something.</p><p>What, exactly, Agatha couldn't say. Not yet. She didn't know whether it was an olive branch - a quiet reassurance that the kiss hadn't broken anything - or the beginning of something neither of them could name. Maybe it was just Rio being kind. Or maybe it was her way of testing the waters and seeing if they could build something more delicate than garden beds.</p><p>Agatha didn't let herself hope too hard for the latter.</p><p>But - after a night of wrestling with her thoughts - she didn't shrink from it either.</p><p>She let herself be wanted just enough to take that step forward.</p><p>And she let herself want just enough not to step back.</p><p>By the time they pulled into the driveway, the sun was high and hot above them, the dashboard blinking an unapologetic 1:17 PM. Agatha turned off the engine with a resigned sigh, glancing in the rearview mirror. The backseat looked like a mobile greenhouse with seedlings, mulch bags, and a rogue watering can all crammed beside Nicky, who sat like a prince among chaos.</p><p>"I promise they didn't mess up your car too bad," Rio said cheerfully, already halfway out of the passenger seat. "A few dirt stains at most. Adds character."</p><p>Agatha gave her a slow, withering look over the roof of the car as she stepped out. "I swear to God, if there's even a <em>speck</em> of dirt on the upholstery-"</p><p>"Hey, I <em>did</em> offer to take my car," Rio cut in, raising both hands in mock innocence. "You were the one who turned up your nose at Meg."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the name. She'd made the mistake of asking about its origin once and was then forced to watch <em>Hercules, </em>which led to Rio and Nicky humming the songs for the next three days.</p><p>"Because <em>Meg</em> wouldn't have survived the trip," she shot back, crossing her arms. "We barely fit the three of us and half of Home Depot in mine. Yours would've keeled over in protest."</p><p>Rio gave her a scandalized look. "Don't disrespect her like that. Meg has stamina." She popped open the back door and pulled out a box of seedlings. Her voice dipped into something lower, smug. "She got it from her owner."</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, not sure how to respond, but a thump on the window saved her. She turned to see Nicky staring at her through the glass, his forehead pressed flat against it.</p><p>"Move, Mama," he said, muffled. Then, remembering himself, added, "Please."</p><p>She stepped back just in time for the door to swing open, and Nicky burst out of the car with more energy than he had any right to after a full soccer game. He darted past her like a missile, already reaching for one of the smaller bags of soil from the trunk.</p><p>"I'll bring everything to the garden!" he called over his shoulder.</p><p>Agatha snagged him gently by the jersey before he could bolt again. "We should change first."</p><p>Nicky paused, glanced at his grass-stained knees and the smudge of mud streaking across his shirt, then looked back up like she was the one missing something obvious.</p><p>"But I'm <em>already</em> dirty," he said, completely serious. "What's the point?"</p><p>Agatha blinked. She couldn't argue with the logic, not really. Still, she opened her mouth to try - only for Rio to appear at Nicky's side, balancing a box of herbs in one arm and giving Agatha an amused look.</p><p>"He's got you there," she said.</p><p>Agatha sighed, already regretting her life choices. "Fine. But if your shirt's unsalvageable by the end of this, you're playing your next game in a stained one."</p><p>"Deal!" Nicky chirped, darting out of the garage through the open door like a kid on a sugar high.</p><p>"And I'm not giving <em>you</em> a new one," she added, raising an eyebrow as she turned toward Rio.</p><p>"Nah, I'm gonna change after I take this out," Rio said with a grin, adjusting her grip on the box. "Getting mud on a shirt with the name Harkness on it feels like blasphemy."</p><p>Agatha meant to scoff, to throw something sarcastic back, but her breath caught instead. She didn't have to see Rio's back to know what she meant. <em>HARKNESS</em>, bold and unmistakable, stretched clean across Rio's shoulder blades, unobstructed by her hair, which she'd put in a high ponytail for the day.</p><p>It wasn't new. It wasn't even meant for <em>her</em>, but for Nicky - a gesture of support, something people did for teams and family photos.</p><p>But it <em>was</em> her name. And seeing it on Rio's back - white letters printed on the dark background, familiar and loud and utterly sincere - made something unsteady bloom in Agatha's chest.</p><p>She didn't let herself dwell on it. She wouldn't permit herself to feel how much she enjoyed it. She tried to focus on the message it sent to others, not on what it meant for her.</p><p>"I think it might be too late for him, though," Rio added, nodding in Nicky's direction with a laugh. "Good thing the team's colors are dark. It'd be a bitch to get grass stains out of white."</p><p>Agatha huffed out a breath, trying to play it cool, even as her heart thudded a little too eagerly. "Yes, my sanity is very thankful."</p><p>Rio grinned, walking past her to follow Nicky. Agatha tried not to stare too much at her back. She failed.</p><p>"I'll see you on the other side," Rio called as she stepped outside, her voice light. "Just don't change into a pantsuit or something."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, lips twitching despite herself. "Hilarious."</p><p>"I know," Rio said with a wink before disappearing around the side of the house.</p><p>Agatha watched the empty space for a second longer than she meant to, the flutter behind her ribs refusing to quit. Then she turned back toward the house, shaking her head to clear her thoughts as she hung her car keys on the hook and headed for the stairs.</p><p>The creak of the second step beneath her foot was familiar, grounding. She used it to anchor herself, reminding her body that this was just an afternoon in the dirt, not a second date.</p><p>Not that the first had been a date.</p><p>Not that she'd stopped thinking about the kiss long enough to decide what <em>any</em> of this was.</p><p>She paused at her bedroom door, fingers brushing the handle before she finally pushed it open. Inside, the room felt cool and still, untouched by the noise and warmth Rio and Nicky brought in their wake. Her closet was half-open from that morning, and she stood in front of it for longer than she'd admit, arms folded, frown deepening as she scanned her options.</p><p>There was absolutely no fucking reason to hesitate. It was dirt and sun and possibly bugs. She needed something she could ruin, something that didn't pull or cling or make her feel like she was on display. She reached for a pair of old joggers at first, gray and fraying at the waistband, then paused.</p><p>
<em>Let yourself want and be wanted.</em>
</p><p>Wanda's words came back like a soft tap on her shoulder. Not a command, just a suggestion. The kind she hadn't known she needed until she'd heard it.</p><p>Agatha's hand drifted to a pair of black cargo pants instead. They were still utilitarian, but newer, better-fitting, and if she remembered correctly, she looked great in them. She paired them with a navy cotton tank and a loose linen button-up she could shed once she warmed up. Nothing flashy, but not invisible, either.</p><p>She glanced at herself in the mirror, then quickly looked away before she could start spiraling. It wasn't about Rio. It wasn't about wanting to be looked at.</p><p>Okay, maybe it was <em>a little.</em></p><p>Her lips quirked despite herself. She ran a brush through her hair, twisted it into a low bun, and grabbed a pair of sunglasses off her dresser before heading for the stairs.</p><p>She was going to help build a garden bed. That was all. She could want that. She could <em>choose</em> that.</p><p>And she was allowed to be seen while she did.</p><p>Her sneakers squeaked softly on the wooden floors as she made her way to the patio door, but she didn't open it right away. Through the glass, she spotted Nicky and Rio already in the garden, crouched together in the sunlight like something out of a photograph.</p><p>Nicky had a stick in one hand and a smear of dirt across his cheek, drawing something in the loose soil with all the seriousness of a child sketching blueprints for a castle. Rio knelt beside him, elbow resting on her bent knee as she leaned forward to point to the drawing.</p><p>Agatha's eyes drifted downward. The jeans Rio wore were well-loved, faded, and torn in places, cuffed at the bottom to show her boots. Her black T-shirt was plain with nothing remarkable about it except for the way it clung lightly to the muscles in her shoulders as she shifted. Agatha felt a tiny, fleeting pang of disappointment at the absence of the flannel Rio sometimes wore on colder days, sleeves rolled to her elbows, the edges fraying just slightly.</p><p>But the feeling vanished the second Rio leaned farther forward, bracing herself with one hand on the soil. Her biceps flexed under her skin, and the inked flowers wrapped around her arm stretched and twisted with the movement. The sun caught the curve of her jaw, her nose scrunched in focus as Nicky explained whatever diagram he'd etched into the dirt.</p><p>On second thought, Agatha could live without the flannel.</p><p>She lingered a second longer at the threshold, the air-conditioned chill of the house pressing lightly against her back while warmth beckoned outside. The moment was soft and golden and entirely theirs - Nicky's dirt-streaked fingers, Rio's laughter ringing low and easy - and Agatha wasn't sure she belonged in it. Not completely.</p><p>But she'd been invited. And she'd said yes.</p><p>Also, it was technically <em>her</em> garden even though it didn't feel like it.</p><p>She took a breath, opened the door, and stepped out before she could change her mind.</p><p>The sound made Rio glance up first, one hand rising to shield her eyes from the sun. Her smile started to form, reflexive and familiar, but then stalled halfway as her gaze caught on Agatha standing in the doorway.</p><p>For a beat, Rio didn't say anything. Her eyes flicked down, not overtly or obviously, but enough. They moved from the hem of Agatha's T-shirt tucked half-heartedly into the waistband of her pants, to the sunglasses perched on her nose. A quiet sweep of detail, like someone committing an image to memory.</p><p>She blinked, then, the pause, small but unmistakable, like she'd been caught mid-thought. Or mid-daydream.</p><p>"There you are," Rio said finally as she stood with easy grace. Her smile followed a moment later, warm and unshaken. "I was starting to think you bailed."</p><p>Agatha didn't catch the delay. Or chose not to. She just lifted an eyebrow in mock offense and stepped farther out onto the patio, pretending her skin wasn't prickling beneath the weight of Rio's gaze.</p><p>"Not everyone has a go-to outfit for digging in the dirt," she said, descending the stairs to join them. "How on earth did you manage to haul all that from the car already?"</p><p>Rio's eyes snapped away from her to look at the haphazardly crafted pile of items to her left, just behind Nicky's drawing. Before she could respond, the boy chimed in from the ground, the stick in his hand adding finishing touches to what Agatha had to assume was the plan for their work.</p><p>"Rio carried all the planks in one trip. And almost fell."</p><p>"Hey!" Rio objected, her hand darting out to playfully poke his dirt-smudged cheek. "The point is that I <em>didn't</em> fall."</p><p>"You tripped on your own foot."</p><p>"Because I couldn't see!" Rio insisted, standing taller now, her arms crossing with mock indignation. "And I wouldn't have to carry it all if <em>your mom</em> didn't refuse to help with the heavy stuff."</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, feeling the familiar rhythm of their banter pull her under. "How is that my fault? You could've taken two trips like a normal person."</p><p>Rio scoffed, affronted. "Two trips? Please. That's for the weak."</p><p>"You almost faceplanted into the dirt," Nicky added as if his mother needed more ammunition.</p><p>"I'm sure I would've made it look cool," Rio muttered, tossing a handful of imaginary hair over her shoulder before narrowing her eyes at the boy. "I was trying to impress you. Clearly, it worked."</p><p>Nicky beamed. "You <em>are</em> pretty strong."</p><p>Rio gave him a mock bow. "Thank you. Finally, someone around here appreciates me."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but found herself smiling before she could stop it. The teasing was familiar, comforting even, and standing in the middle of Rio and Nicky's dirt-streaked world didn't feel entirely like trespassing anymore.</p><p>She caught Rio's eyes for a moment. There was something unspoken there, light but present. An awareness.</p><p>Agatha shifted her weight and looked away first.</p><p>"Alright," she said, clapping her hands once. "What's the plan, foreman?"</p><p>Nicky scrambled to his feet and pointed at one of the wobbly rectangles he'd drawn in the dirt. "This is the one for flowers. Rio said it's good for bees, so we'll have lots of 'em when we're done."</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. "Great. Bugs."</p><p>"Bees aren't bugs," Rio commented, moving to stand beside Nicky. Her hand brushed lightly against Agatha's as she passed, sending a spark of heat up Agatha's arm.</p><p>"We'll call it the bee zone," Nicky continued, undeterred. "There'll also be herbs, but not mint 'cause it's selfish."</p><p>Rio smiled at the wording. "It spreads and can take over other plants."</p><p>"That's what I said," Nicky protested, using his stick to point at the second rectangle. "And here we'll have lettuce, onion, and all that other green stuff."</p><p>Agatha chuckled, ruffling his hair. "You do realize we'll have to eat all that other green stuff so it doesn't go to waste, right?"</p><p>Nicky's hand stalled, the stick hovering over some illegible letters. "No? We're just having fun on our Family Garden Day. See, I wrote it here."</p><p>He jabbed at a particularly messy scrawl in the dirt that looked like it had been edited a few times, the word <em>family</em> scratched over and rewritten with more care.</p><p>Agatha stared at it a second longer than she meant to.</p><p>Family Garden Day.</p><p>The words echoed louder in her head than she liked, and she was grateful Rio wasn't looking at her just then. Not with that word floating in the open air, not when her defenses hadn't quite been raised for it.</p><p>"That's... a very official name," she managed finally.</p><p>"It has to be!" Nicky beamed. "We're building things. That's a grown-up thing."</p><p>"And the grown-up thing to do is get our hands dirty, right?" Rio added, tossing a wink toward Agatha.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her smirk gave her away. "Fine. But if I find even <em>one</em> worm, I'm going inside."</p><p>"You'll be fine," Rio said, bumping her shoulder as she passed again. "You've survived worse than earthworms."</p><p>"Have I, though?"</p><p>"You married me," Rio called over her shoulder, grabbing a trowel and kneeling beside the first bed-to-be. "That's at least comparable."</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth for a sharp retort, but Nicky's giggle cut through her thoughts, bright and unguarded, and she found she didn't want to fight the smile threatening her lips.</p><p>"Alright, foreman," she said, crouching down beside him. "Let's do this. But you're not getting out of eating that lettuce just because you think it's for decoration."</p><p>Nicky groaned dramatically but picked up the nearby spade with theatrical commitment. "But not the onions."</p><p>"We'll negotiate later," Agatha murmured, pulling on her working gloves.</p><p>Beside her, Rio let out a low hum of approval. "Look at you. A farm wife in the making."</p><p>Agatha threw a clump of dirt at her without looking.</p><hr/><p>The sun drifted lower as the hours passed. Agatha had taken off her cover shirt sometime between digging out patches of grass and helping Rio lay down the mulch film, her top clinging to her back with sweat as they worked. The garden was quiet, except for the occasional grumble passed between them when a measurement was off or a root refused to budge, but there was laughter too, easy and frequent.</p><p>Agatha found herself looking up more often than she meant to. Watching Rio's movements, how she squatted to dig, how she brushed her hair back with the back of her wrist, how she muttered to herself when she couldn't line up a board correctly. It felt oddly intimate, working like this. Not just with Rio, but <em>beside</em> her, like they were a team.</p><p>Or a family.</p><p>At one point, Agatha crouched opposite Rio, their hands mirroring each other at either end of a long plank they were prepping to connect. Her gloves were stained at the fingertips, palms pressed against the rough wood as she waited for Rio to line up the edges. The sun cast everything in a warm gold that made the sweat clinging to Rio's skin shimmer like heat-glazed glass.</p><p>Rio grumbled something under her breath - either "off-balance" or "well-balanced", Agatha couldn't tell - before shifting suddenly, one hand still gripping the wood while her body curved forward to reach for the drill tossed a few feet away. Nicky, who was in charge of handing her the tools, had gone inside the house a moment before, and Rio wasn't one to wait. She moved with easy, practiced confidence, her torso folding, her back arched in a fluid line.</p><p>Agatha's throat went dry instantly.</p><p>Her gaze drifted before she could stop it, tracking the motion helplessly. The T-shirt lifted slightly, revealing a strip of tanned, damp skin just above the waistband of her jeans, the muscles beneath tightening as Rio extended her arm. The tattoos that wrapped around her biceps and disappeared under her sleeve looked almost alive in the light, the inked petals and vines seeming to shift with her movement.</p><p>Agatha's fingers tightened slightly on the plank.</p><p>Her mind, the fucking traitor, hummed unhelpfully: <em>You could trace those lines with your fingers. Or your tongue. See how she tastes after over two hours in the sun...</em></p><p>She blinked hard, trying to shove the thoughts aside, but her eyes refused to obey, lingering on the curve of Rio's waist, the subtle dip of her spine, the confident strength in her stretched arm. Her breath hitched, quiet but sharp, snapping her out of the daze just in time to notice Rio return to her original position, her lips moving as she said something low and quick.</p><p>Agatha's eyes darted to her mouth, then to her hand, where the drill was now poised and-</p><p>Pain erupted suddenly.</p><p>The plank, unbalanced after all, shifted forward and smacked hard into Agatha's hand, crushing her knuckles against the bed's ready side. She let out a sharp yelp, the force knocking her off balance and sending her tumbling backward into the gravel path.</p><p>"Shit - Agatha!"</p><p>The drill clattered to the side as Rio dropped it, scrambling around the board to get to her. Agatha clutched her hand, lips curved in a grimace.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Rio asked, crouching beside her, her voice tight with a mix of concern and guilt. "Did I hit you? Fuck, are your fingers broken?"</p><p>Agatha inhaled through her teeth, refusing to look directly at her as she tried to blink away the tears building in her eyes. "I'm fine," she snapped, though her voice wavered and her fingers curled instinctively against her palm, cradling her hand like it might fall apart if she let go. The pain pulsed in sharp, searing waves up her wrist and through her forearm, each throb more insistent than the last.</p><p>Jesus, it was her right hand.</p><p>Panic crawled into her chest, prickly and fast. If something <em>was</em> broken, she'd be out of commission for weeks. Maybe longer. She could manage typing, sure, but infuriatingly slowly. And client meetings - what kind of impression would she make, walking in with a cast like some ill-tempered brawler? Cooking, dressing, brushing her damn teeth - how did anyone live with a dominant hand out of the equation? How would she-</p><p>"Agatha. <em>Agatha</em>, hey, look at me."</p><p>Warm hands cupped her face.</p><p>Not her wrist, not her hand, not the place where it hurt, but her <em>face</em>. Gentle but steady. Rio's thumbs brushed the edge of her jaw, grounding her like an anchor dropped in deep water.</p><p>Agatha blinked rapidly, startled by the contact. Her thoughts hiccuped. She hadn't realized she was shaking.</p><p>"I need you to match my breathing, okay?" Rio's voice was low and even, a soft balm against the sharp edges in Agatha's head. The woman's face was close, blurred at the edges by unshed tears that clung stubbornly to Agatha's lashes, but her presence was unmistakable. Solid and steady. <em>Safe</em>.</p><p>Rio inhaled deeply, exaggerated just enough to be followed. "In with me."</p><p>Agatha tried. Her breath hitched halfway in, but she forced her lungs to fill.</p><p>"Good," Rio murmured, nodding. "Now out."</p><p>They did it again. And again. Until the panic started to bleed out of her shoulders and jaw. Until the pain, though still fierce, became background noise instead of an all-consuming scream.</p><p>Only then did Agatha realize how close Rio had gotten. Her thumbs still brushed her cheeks in absent, gentle passes, like she couldn't quite let go yet.</p><p>Agatha didn't move to stop her.</p><p>"Okay," Rio said, still soft. "Let me see."</p><p>Agatha hesitated before extending her arm, wincing as her fingers unfurled. The pain sharpened again at the movement, and she hissed.</p><p>"I'm gonna take the glove off, okay?"</p><p>The panic rose in Agatha's chest again, but before she could pull the arm back, Rio's fingers wrapped gently around her wrist.</p><p>"We need to take it off before it swells too much," Rio's voice reminded Agatha of somebody coaxing a wounded animal out of its hiding place to help it. She wanted to snap, to say she didn't need charity, but then Rio's grip tightened in a reassuring squeeze, their eyes meeting again, and all Agatha could do was nod and brace herself for the pain.</p><p>Rio took her hand like it was something fragile and precious, gently tugging on each finger to slowly pry the glove off. Every tug made Agatha's arm tense, her muscles coiling as she fought off the urge to yank her hand out of the hold, but Rio's ministrations didn't produce any more pain. Just the grounding, hopeful feeling that someone was <em>there. </em></p><p>The glove slipped off with a final pull and joined Rio's own on the ground beside them, soundlessly landing in the dirt.</p><p>"Alright," Rio murmured, angling Agatha's palm toward the light, her voice laced with relief. Her fingers glided over the injured knuckles, light as feathers, the touch barely there, but still managing to ease the tension in Agatha's arm. "Doesn't look broken. The swelling's starting, though. We should ice it right away, just in case."</p><p>"I didn't realize you were <em>that</em> kind of doctor," Agatha muttered, aiming for teasing as she grasped for the last straws of familiarity in the strange situation. Rio was kneeling in front of her, holding her injured hand in the gentlest manner Agatha had ever experienced, and she looked <em>worried</em>. Like Agatha's well-being was important to her.</p><p>Like, well, like she <em>cared</em>.</p><p>"I'm not any kind of doctor yet," Rio said with a faint grin. "But you learn a thing or two after years of playing soccer. I've sprained, bruised, and jammed everything that <em>can</em> be sprained, bruised, or jammed."</p><p>"So, you're a hazard to yourself."</p><p>"And to others, apparently," the grin faltered, replaced by a sheepish tilt of her mouth. "I'm sorry. It's my fault."</p><p>Agatha's first instinct was to agree.</p><p>
<em>Of course it is. You slammed a fucking board into my dominant hand, and now I can't move my fingers without feeling like they're on fire.</em>
</p><p>But... that wasn't fair.</p><p>It <em>wasn't </em>Rio's fault, at least not the way she meant. Because if Agatha hadn't been so consumed by the sight of her - her spine curving in motion, the sun glinting off her tattoos, the stretch of skin above her waistband - then maybe she would've noticed the warning. Maybe she would've braced, moved her hand, <em>done literally anything</em> other than sit there like a fool, staring.</p><p>And she couldn't exactly blame Rio for being too distracting, not without admitting that she'd been watching.</p><p>Agatha let out a grunt and pulled her injured hand from Rio's gentle hold, the movement sharper than she meant it to be. They were too close. Too much warmth and too little air, and Rio's touch, though soft enough to calm the ache, only made things worse. Worse in a way that had nothing to do with nerves and everything to do with the slow, ruinous pull behind Agatha's ribs.</p><p>"No, it's not," she muttered. "I didn't catch the warning."</p><p>She moved to get up, gritting her teeth as her knees sank into the gravel. It shifted beneath her treacherously, and just as she started to lose balance, Rio's hands were there again, gripping her forearms, steady and sure. Lifting her before she could fall, before she could decide whether she even <em>wanted </em>to get up.</p><p>Before Agatha could bark something sharp to cover her embarrassment, Rio took her uninjured hand and, with the same care as before, peeled off the remaining glove.</p><p>"Figured you wouldn't want to use your teeth. It's covered in dirt."</p><p>Her fingers lingered, not long enough to be obvious, but long enough to feel intentional. A whisper of a pause. Then she let go, but didn't move back. She stayed close, her gaze steady and open, her presence grounding in a way Agatha had no defenses against.</p><p>It was a problem. She wanted to be mad. She <em>should</em> be mad.</p><p>She should yank the armor back on and deflect with something cold and biting, like <em>You owe me a new hand</em> or <em>That's why I pay the gardener to do the work</em>. Something that would create the distance she needed.</p><p>But Rio wasn't stepping back. And worse, neither was she.</p><p>Agatha couldn't blame her for the warmth settling in her chest like something earned, or for the impossible idea blooming behind her ribs that said, <em>You could lean on her. She wouldn't let you fall</em>.</p><p>She wanted to fall.</p><p>God help her, she wanted to <em>fall</em>.</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, the fight draining from her shoulders. The sting in her hand was still sharp, but the ache in her chest was beginning to shift, stretching into something less rigid.</p><p>"Thanks," she said, quieter than intended. Not grudging or sarcastic, just... real. "For helping."</p><p>Rio's gaze flicked up to hers, surprised but unreadable. And then she smiled softly. "Anytime."</p><p>The word hit harder than it should have. It carried weight, not just in the promise of physical help, but in the quiet presence she'd been offering Agatha all day without asking for anything back. She wasn't hovering or pushing. She was just <em>there</em>. Like she might stay if Agatha let her.</p><p>Before Agatha could say anything else - before she did something stupid like let that smile undo her completely or try to feel it against her lips - the sound of a door opening pulled both their attention toward the house.</p><p>Nicky trotted out, a box of orange juice in his hand, while the other rested on the banister at the top of the stairs. "Are you coming? It's break time!"</p><p>"Says the one who worked the least," Agatha muttered, grateful for the interruption.</p><p>Rio stepped back just enough to give her space, but didn't stray far, still close enough that Agatha could feel the warmth she left behind. "Hey, buddy, do me a favor?"</p><p>Nicky perked up instantly. "Yeah?"</p><p>"Can you grab one of those ice packs from the freezer?" she asked, her voice light but laced with gentle urgency. "The squishy kind. It should be in the bottom drawer."</p><p>Nicky's eyes flicked between them, lingering on Agatha's cradled hand. "Are you hurt?"</p><p>"I'm okay," Agatha said reflexively, even as she winced when her fingers twitched. "It's just a bruise."</p><p>Rio gave her a look that said <em>Let me take care of you for once</em>, then turned back to Nicky. "She needs it for her hand. A plank wanted revenge."</p><p>Nicky gasped with genuine but somewhat theatrical concern. "I <em>told</em> you to give Mama the safety talk!"</p><p>"You did," Rio agreed, biting back a smile. "I'll give it to her while you grab the ice pack."</p><p>Nicky nodded solemnly, already halfway to the door. "I'll get the squishy one!" he called, disappearing inside with the same focused energy he'd applied to his dirt diagrams.</p><p>Agatha looked back at Rio, whose arms were now folded, her expression somewhere between amused and concerned.</p><p>"I'll break my other hand if you start preaching about safety," Agatha warned.</p><p>"Who's a hazard to herself now?" Rio asked, her voice light and teasing. "No safety talks, I promise. I don't want to make the experience even worse."</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek, looking down at her throbbing hand, then back up at Rio. "It wasn't that bad," she admitted quietly. "I can understand why Nicky loves working with you here so much."</p><p>"Well, I've never injured <em>him</em>. Thank God."</p><p>"No, it's-" Agatha paused, her eyes sweeping across the scene before them: the sun casting shadows across the gravel, the half-finished raised beds waiting patiently, the scattered tools forgotten amidst the chaos. Her gaze returned to Rio, soft but searching.</p><p>"This is more than just a hobby for you. You pour your heart into something small, something ordinary, and you nurture it until it becomes something full of life. Something that grows. And the way you share that - without hesitation, without ego - it's... generous. It's brave."</p><p>Her voice dropped, almost embarrassed by its own honesty. "Nicky loves it here because you don't just plant and grow things. You build something out of nothing and make people feel like they belong in it."</p><p>She looked at her hand again, barely registering the pain now. "Even people like me."</p><p>Rio's breath caught for just a second, not enough to be obvious, not enough to make Agatha retreat, but enough that it rippled between them like the echo of a heartbeat.</p><p>For a moment, Rio didn't speak. Her arms had fallen loosely to her sides, hands brushing idly against her thighs, fingers twitching with some impulse she didn't act on. When she finally did speak, her voice was quieter than before. Softer.</p><p>"People like you," Rio repeated as if tasting the words. "You say that like it's a bad thing."</p><p>Agatha huffed out a breath, not quite a laugh. "Have you met me? I think every person who knows me would tell you that inviting me to help you was insane."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her gaze steady. "Then they don't know you too well because you accepted. You <em>chose</em> to be here."</p><p>"I did," Agatha said after a beat, eyes flickering down again. "Because... I wanted to."</p><p>And there it was, simple and terrifying.</p><p>Rio stepped closer. She didn't touch her, didn't reach out, but the space between them tightened. "You can want things, you know," she said gently. "You're allowed."</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched, Wanda's words echoing quietly in her mind again - <em>Let yourself want and be wanted.</em></p><p>The truth of it all settled around her like sun-warmed air.</p><p>"I'm trying," she muttered.</p><p>"I can see that," Rio said just as quietly, ducking her neck to catch Agatha's eyes. Her fingers flexed against her jeans again like she was fighting the urge to reach out. "And I appreciate it. I know this isn't easy for you - being here, doing things, letting me help. But you're doing it. And I'm proud of you. For trying."</p><p>Agatha blinked at the words as if they'd struck a nerve she didn't know she'd left exposed. They landed gently, without expectation or pressure, and yet they vibrated in her chest like a chord struck too cleanly.</p><p>She stared at Rio, searching for the catch - sarcasm, pity, some mischief curling at the corner of her mouth - but there was none. Just honesty, soft and unshakable.</p><p>It made her breath catch all over again.</p><p>She swallowed, her throat dry, suddenly aware of how close they stood, how little air seemed to exist between them. The weight of the moment pressed down, not heavy but intimate, like the pause before something inevitable. Her eyes flicked downward - barely a flick, but enough.</p><p>To Rio's mouth. The shape of it. The way it parted like she might speak, or-</p><p>No. No, she wasn't leaning in. Not really. And Agatha wasn't either. But the space felt charged. Tensed.</p><p>Agatha's hand ached, but the flutter in her chest was louder. She remembered the taste of wine, the sweetness of tiramisu, the curve of Rio's smile just before she kissed her that night. She remembered everything.</p><p>And she <em>wanted </em>- all-consumingly and hopelessly - to feel that again. To <em>taste</em> <em>her </em>again.</p><p>But she didn't move, and neither did Rio. Her eyes dipped - maybe to Agatha's lips, maybe not - but she stayed rooted, still watching, waiting.</p><p>And then-</p><p>"I got it!" Nicky's voice rang out from the house, clear and proud. The screen door banged behind him as he raced down the steps with a bright blue ice pack held high like a trophy. "It was behind the peas!"</p><p>Rio blinked, stepping back just enough for the tension to scatter like startled birds. She turned toward the boy with a soft laugh and reached out for the pack. "You're the best, buddy. We'd be lost without you."</p><p>"I know," Nicky said with all the confidence in the world before turning to look up at his mother with wide, serious eyes. "Did Rio give you the safety talk? Are you really okay?"</p><p>The worried tremor in his voice snapped Agatha out of her daze. She blinked, then reached out with her good hand to ruffle his hair gently, offering the closest thing to a smile she could muster. "She did. And it's nothing a little ice can't fix," she said, voice softening. "But I'm afraid I won't be too much help anymore. It's just you and Rio against the planks now."</p><p>Nicky frowned, glancing at the ice pack still cradled in Rio's hands. "No. We can finish later."</p><p>"Baby-"</p><p>"It's okay, Mama," Nicky interrupted, his tone already firm with quiet decision. He shook his head, curls bouncing slightly, like the matter had already been settled. "It won't be Family Garden Day without you. And we need to take care of your hand."</p><p>Agatha's smile curved a little wider, brought on by the earnestness in his voice. "It just needs a little ice. I can take care of it myself, baby."</p><p>Nicky tilted his head like she'd just said something illogical. "Uh, yeah, but you don't have to," he said slowly, gesturing toward Rio without even looking. "Rio's here."</p><p>His tone was so matter-of-fact, so unbothered and certain, that it landed heavier than Agatha expected. He'd said it like it was the most obvious thing in the world, not just that Rio <em>could</em> help as the only other grown-up, but that she <em>would</em>. That she <em>should</em>. That she belonged there, right next to them, tending to their injuries.</p><p>Rio huffed a soft laugh through her nose, part-amusement, part-shock, and shifted the ice pack in her hands. "I suppose I've been volunteered," she said, voice light as she glanced at Agatha, who could feel her cheeks flush. "How about we set you up on the porch? I'll clean up the garden later."</p><p>"Oh, I can do that!" Nicky exclaimed quickly, already darting toward the first pile of tools. "Take care of Mama!" he shouted over his shoulder, halfway toward the shed with a shovel balancing precariously in his arms.</p><p>Agatha's flush deepened at the words as she stared after him, unsure what to say. She startled at the sound of a Velcro strap being pulled open, and then hissed when something cold touched her swollen hand.</p><p>"Sorry," Rio murmured, securing the pack with care that made Agatha's chest tighten. Not because of the injury - not entirely - but from the kind of tenderness that felt dangerously close to comfort. "How's the pain? Do you need some meds?"</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly, absentmindedly picking at the Velcro strap without looking up from her hand. "You don't have to do that, Rio. He's a kid, he doesn't..." She trailed off, unsure of what she wanted to say as her gaze traveled back up to the woman before her.</p><p>"You're right," Rio agreed, meeting her eyes with unwavering calmness. "I don't have to do anything. But I <em>want</em> to. And we're both allowed that."</p><p>A gentle hand settled on Agatha's lower back, steering her toward the porch. She went willingly, shocked by the quiet weight behind the words.</p><p>They reached the porch steps in a slow hush. The boards creaked under their weight as Rio helped her sit, careful with every movement, like Agatha might break if jostled too quickly.</p><p>For once, Agatha didn't feel the need to snap at her for the unnecessary help. She allowed herself the unfamiliar tenderness aching in her chest, unsure how to hold it without fearing it might disappear the moment she leaned in too far, but unable to forfeit it altogether.</p><p>Rio sat beside her, close but not touching, elbow resting casually against the back of the bench. She glanced at Agatha's face, then at her hand, and finally let her eyes wander out to the half-built garden beds where Nicky's small form zipped between shadows and sunlight, gathering the scattered tools.</p><p>"He's really something," Rio said after a moment, voice soft. "You've done a great job with him."</p><p>Agatha followed her gaze, her throat tightening again. "Some days it feels like I'm winging it. Like I'm navigating a minefield of my own flaws and trying not to mess him up by passing them on."</p><p>Rio looked back at her. "Everybody's winging it. That's what life - and love - is, I think. Trying, even when you're scared you'll get it wrong."</p><p>The words settled deep, grounding and terrifying all at once. Agatha stared at the horizon, the warm gold of late afternoon catching in the trees and lighting the grass like it was gilded.</p><p>"I thought my life was over when I found out I was pregnant," she said quietly, keeping her eyes fixed on an invisible point in the distance. "I was thirty. I'd just made senior associate. Partner was in reach. Everything I thought I wanted was finally happening. And then... one slip, and suddenly my life was rearranged. All because I let my mother get into my head."</p><p>She felt Rio go still beside her, not moving away, but bracing, like she always did when Evanora's name drifted close. Like her body was waiting to shield something.</p><p>"I knew I was gay," Agatha continued. "Had known for years. But I still slept with him. I thought if I could just... override myself somehow, prove her wrong, maybe she'd finally stop looking at me like I was defective." Her jaw tensed, her good hand curling slightly in her lap. "I thought maybe if I could be what she wanted, she'd finally love me the way I needed her to."</p><p>The silence between them stretched, soft but heavy.</p><p>"I know better now," she said after a moment. "There's nothing wrong with me, not that way. Being gay isn't some flaw I have to fix. If anything, it's one of the few things about myself I've made peace with. But back then..." Her voice cracked slightly, and she didn't bother hiding it. "Back then, I just wanted to be wanted. And I thought the only way to earn that was to become someone else."</p><p>A single cloud drifted across the sky, shapeless and slow. She tracked it with her eyes, willing herself not to sink.</p><p>"When I got pregnant, I promised myself that Nicky would never feel like I did. That he'd never question his worth. That no matter what, he'd never feel unloved in his own home or look into my eyes and see the same cold judgment I see in hers."</p><p>Agatha watched the cloud dissolve into the blue, then let her eyes fall shut for a second, taking in slow and uneven.</p><p>"I promised myself I'd be better for him," she said, barely above a whisper. "Kinder. Softer. More stable than what I grew up with. And I think... I think I've managed that, most days. But I still feel it. That voice in my head - hers, mine, both - reminding me I'm not enough. That I'm too difficult. That anyone who gets close will eventually see the cracks and leave."</p><p>She let the confession hang there, naked and ugly. It ached to say aloud, but it was truer than anything else she'd said all day.</p><p>"So I always leave first. Even when somebody manages to scale the walls I'd surrounded myself with, I run and I don't look back because it's easier than seeing another person slowly understand that I'm unlovable. That my mother was, to some extent, right."</p><p>She drew in a long breath, grounding herself in the warmth of the setting sun and the steadiness of Rio's presence beside her.</p><p>"You're right about life and love," she added, turning her head slightly. "It's about trying. Even when it scares the hell out of you. Even when you're sure you're going to mess it all up."</p><p>Her lips twitched into something small - a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.</p><p>"I'm trying, Rio. That's all I know how to do."</p><p>Rio just looked at her for a beat, <em>really</em> looked at her, in that special way only she could - like Agatha wasn't something sharp that needed to be handled carefully, but something important. Something worth holding onto.</p><p>Then she shifted a little closer on the bench, knees brushing, her voice low but steady.</p><p>"I'm not leaving," she said simply.</p><p>Agatha blinked. "Maybe you should."</p><p>Rio's eyes softened. "Why? Because you've been hurt? Because you've built walls to survive and still found a way to raise one of the kindest kids I've ever met? Because you feel too much and try too hard and can't see that's exactly what makes you lovable?"</p><p>Agatha tried to scoff, but it came out shaky. "You don't know everything about me."</p><p>"No," Rio agreed. "But I know enough. I know you paid to get my car fixed because you didn't want me walking around the city at night. I know you rushed to the hospital after I'd gotten hurt and worked from home to look after me until I got cleared. I know you always put a blanket on me when I fall asleep on the couch, and order my favorite every time you get takeout so I have something to eat after work."</p><p>She paused, letting the words settle.</p><p>"You don't have to believe it yet," she added gently. "That you're lovable. That you deserve more than just surviving. But I do. And I'm not going anywhere just because you're still figuring that out."</p><p>Agatha turned her head slowly, her chest tight, her injured hand forgotten beneath the ice. Her mouth parted like she wanted to respond - to argue, deflect, or maybe just say thank you - but nothing came out.</p><p>So she just nodded.</p><p>And Rio didn't push. Didn't ask for more than that.</p><p>She just leaned back against the bench, letting the quiet return while the sun warmed their skin. Close but not pressing. Steady and sure.</p><p>Trying, just like Agatha.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha hadn't meant to say any of it.</p><p>Even hours later, her own voice echoed in her mind like someone else's confession - too soft, too raw, too dangerously real.</p><p>She'd spent years sculpting herself into something precise and untouchable, her sharp edges forged by necessity, honed by disappointment. But then Rio had looked at her like she wasn't broken. She'd touched her with that steady tenderness Agatha never knew how to receive, and everything had just... slipped out.</p><p>It had felt like swinging a sledgehammer at the fortress she'd built brick by brick. Every word she'd spoken had been a blow to the structure, knocking loose the defenses Rio had been quietly wearing down for months. And at that moment, it felt good. Liberating, even. Like she'd finally come up for air after years underwater.</p><p>But then the moment ended.</p><p>And Agatha was left standing in the wreckage with no idea how to rebuild.</p><p>She'd foolishly hoped that Rio might say something in the quiet of the evening or the next morning. Not even a declaration, but a half-teasing remark to cut through the fog, or a gentle joke to help them step around the mess she'd made. That was what Rio did: she took the heaviness and held it with grace before it could bring them down.</p><p>But morning came, and Rio didn't mention it.</p><p>And then another day. And another.</p><p>And Agatha tried not to fixate. She threw herself into work, into the endless stream of court prep and unread emails, all of it more difficult than usual with her hand aching every time she pushed too hard. The pain was a constant reminder of the garden, and the purple bruises marring her knuckles mapped out the places where Rio had touched her like she mattered.</p><p>Rio was still around, kind and present in all the ways that counted. But Agatha felt the invisible shift. She saw the new space between them that hadn't been there before - lighter than the one she'd subjected them to over a month ago, but still oppressive.</p><p>Whenever Rio smiled, her eyes moved on too fast. She lingered less. She'd rushed to finish the last of the raised beds like she needed the project off her plate. Her runs stretched longer, and when she returned, her face was unreadable, like she was wearing an armor of her own, one Agatha hadn't seen before.</p><p>She was still there, but <em>off</em>. Like a door usually left open was slowly being pulled shut.</p><p>Agatha knew it had to be the garden. Seeing her break like that. Maybe Rio didn't know what to do with Agatha after watching the mask slip. Maybe it made her uncomfortable. Maybe she was retreating because she didn't want to cross a line.</p><p>Because people always did that when they saw too much of her: they flinched away.</p><p>And Agatha told herself she was okay with that. Rio was protecting the fragile, newly formed friendship. Preserving the thing they'd both agreed on.</p><p>But no matter how many times she repeated that, it didn't stop the ache.</p><p>Because Rio had told her she'd stay, and now it was clear she wouldn't. Not really. Not after seeing Agatha's old wounds and all the messy, unresolved pieces she didn't know how to hide. Not after learning that caring, for Agatha, meant trying without any promise she wouldn't screw it up.</p><p>Agatha wanted to be angry about the betrayal. Anger was easier. Anger could build walls faster than grief could tear them down and protect her from the humiliation of having hoped for more.</p><p>But the anger wouldn't come.</p><p>There was only the slow, bitter realization that Rio had been right: love and life <em>were </em>about trying, even when you were terrified you'd fail. And maybe Rio couldn't try.</p><p>Maybe Agatha had read what they had wrong.</p><p>Maybe she'd given away too much. And Rio had seen that, seen <em>her</em>, and finally decided not to look again.</p><p>And maybe that was fair.</p><p>After all the pushing and pulling, the mixed signals and the relentless tug-of-war between pride and longing, maybe Rio was finally choosing herself.</p><p>Agatha couldn't blame her for that.</p><p>There hadn't been an outright confession - no declarations, no lines crossed that couldn't be ignored - so expecting a conversation to clear the air felt... presumptuous. Rio hadn't rejected her because Agatha hadn't given her anything solid <em>to</em> reject.</p><p>All she'd said was that she could try.</p><p>And if that wasn't enough for Rio - if <em>she</em> wasn't enough - then, well, it wouldn't be the first time someone had come to that conclusion.</p><p>She could live with that.</p><p>But it would be easier if Rio weren't still <em>there.</em></p><p>She still brought Agatha hand cream when the swelling got bad. Still remembered how she liked her tea. Still laughed at Nicky's jokes and discussed Minecraft with bright enthusiasm.</p><p>She wasn't cruel or dismissive. She hadn't disappeared like after Agatha had redrawn the line. And it made forgetting about the garden impossible.</p><p>The soft pull of Rio's hand on her back.</p><p>The quiet certainty in her voice when she said, <em>We're both allowed that</em>.</p><p>The way she hadn't looked away when Agatha said the words she hadn't even meant to say aloud, not just about Evanora or the pregnancy or the fear, but about trying.</p><p>It was the closest thing to a confession Agatha could give, and Rio had heard it. Agatha <em>knew </em>she had.</p><p>She also knew Rio had seen her and then turned away like the sight had been too much.</p><p>And it hurt, so she didn't touch it, hoping that the wound would eventually scab over. She buried it under work, under politeness, under all the ways she knew how to be competent instead of cracked. And every time she caught herself wondering if Rio was just busy or distracted or dealing with something she didn't want to share, Agatha reminded herself that she had no right to ask.</p><p>Because she'd never <em>actually </em>said it.</p><p>And so she had to live with the consequences of what she <em>didn't</em> say and couldn't bring up.</p><p>Not that there weren't opportunities, handed to her by Rio in the form of a cup of tea and a question about how she was sleeping, even though the dark circles under Agatha's eyes had turned practically permanent.</p><p>Agatha approached those opportunities only to pull back like she'd touched a hot stove.</p><p>Because what was she supposed to say?</p><p>
<em>Did I scare you off?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Did you mean it when you said you were proud of me?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Did I shatter us again? Is there even an 'us' anymore? Has there ever been?</em>
</p><p>The questions felt ridiculous in daylight. They made her feel small and clingy, like some pathetic woman hoping for something she could never have. And so she kept quiet, stacking her silences on top of Rio's until the whole house felt like it was balancing on a fault line.</p><p>Still, she watched because there was nothing else left for her.</p><p>She watched the shift in Rio's posture - the way her shoulders stayed squared but her hands fidgeted now, often half-tucked into her pockets or wrapped around a mug for too long. She noticed how her laughter, once unguarded and whole-bodied, came quieter now and died fast. How she moved around Agatha with practiced ease, but not closeness.</p><p>It was somehow worse than anger or a fight.</p><p>It was <em>absence</em>.</p><p>Because she'd opened up, yes, but only partway. Just enough to make it hurt when nothing came back. And now she was caught in the limbo of almost - almost a conversation, almost a moment, almost <em>something real</em>.</p><p>But almost didn't keep you warm or answer questions. It didn't promise a fucking thing except for longing that felt like lead in her stomach and grief for something that never even existed.</p><p>So she did what she did best - compartmentalized. She folded the hurt, the embarrassment, and every stupid almost into its box and brought a nail gun to seal the lids shut.</p><p>And whenever some of it still escaped, whenever she was too tired to fight the weight pressing down on her chest, she lied the way she'd learned years ago. She blamed the dark circles under her eyes on an uncomfortable mattress, the permanent crease between her brows on work, and the bone-deep weariness on life in general.</p><p>But the truth curled up beside her in bed at night like something alive and whispering.</p><p>Rio was pulling away.</p><hr/><p>Four days after the garden, the puzzle pieces began to shift just as Agatha started to learn how to live with the previous picture.</p><p>It started with a crumpled piece of paper.</p><p>There was nothing particularly special about it. Just a white lump lying in the hallway, tucked in the spot where Rio usually left her shoes, like it had fallen from her pocket while she'd been searching for her keys or AirPods.</p><p>Agatha bent to pick it up, intending to toss it in the trash before Nicky could accidentally kick it under the furniture or track it into the house. It wasn't until her fingers closed around it that something snagged her attention.</p><p>The paper was heavier than expected - stiff, matte, clean-edged. Not a receipt or junk mail like Agatha had expected. Not the kind of thing someone threw away without thinking.</p><p>And it had been crushed. Not gently folded or lightly creased from traveling in a pocket, but crumpled like somebody had closed their fist around it.</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>She shouldn't pry. The paper wasn't hers, and she didn't need to know.</p><p>She should throw it away without looking. Whatever changed between her and Rio couldn't be explained by a stray piece of paper on the floor, and believing anything else bordered on insanity. Life didn't just scatter clues around the house for you to find and get the answers you wanted.</p><p>But the past few days had hollowed something out in her, left a raw ache she couldn't seem to numb with reason or distraction. And the quiet voice that had been scratching inside her skull - the one that still wanted, hoped, and feared she'd gotten it wrong - wasn't so easily silenced anymore.</p><p>So Agatha opened it.</p><p>She did it slowly, methodically, casting glances around like somebody might materialize in the empty house and catch her in the act. Her fingers trembled faintly, the dull ache in her hand flaring with every movement as if to remind her it wasn't right. But she didn't stop.</p><p>And then she saw it.</p><p>Evanora Harkness.</p><p>And a phone number.</p><p>Printed in deep ink across thick, cream-toned cardstock - subtle, elegant, and impossible to forget. The number beneath the name wasn't a personal line. It was the office number, the one that rang in the marble-tiled suite downtown, behind glass doors etched with her initials.</p><p>Agatha's breath caught.</p><p>She stared at the name as it bled into the paper, cold and unmistakable. Her stomach dipped sharply, like missing a step in the dark.</p><p>Maybe it had nothing to do with her. Maybe Rio had picked it up by accident. Evanora knew half the city, after all. Maybe she'd given it to someone else, and it somehow ended up in Rio's hands. Or maybe, a darker voice suggested, she'd handed it over directly. Intentionally.</p><p>Her fingers curled tighter around the paper, sending a fresh spark of pain up her arm. She ignored it.</p><p>It didn't make sense. Rio hated Evanora. She bristled every time the woman's name came up. She defended Agatha more fiercely than Agatha ever defended herself. She wouldn't-</p><p>But she might.</p><p>Maybe not even because she wanted to, but because Evanora had a way of infecting things. Getting under people's skin. Making offers that were hard to refuse.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her hand squeezing the paper like a stress ball.</p><p>There was no immediate logic to follow. The card could mean numerous things, most of them innocent enough to forget. She shouldn't make assumptions.</p><p>But it gnawed at her. The card, Rio's subtle withdrawal, her insistence on making the marriage seem more real. They created a pattern, but not a coherent one. Each piece pointed to a different direction, and Agatha, with her tired hand and tired heart, didn't know which way to look.</p><p>The card could mean that Rio had been talking to Evanora. It could've been in Rio's pocket for days, promising something the woman couldn't overlook.</p><p>If Evanora had offered Rio a clean break with a generous check, then it would explain the silence. Maybe the conversation didn't scare Rio off - maybe she wasn't interested to begin with, focused solely on money. And Evanora could've offered her enough to make her change her mind about the marriage.</p><p>But Rio knew the marriage wasn't only about <em>Agatha</em> getting the money. It was about not letting the inheritance go to some nefarious organizations that stood against everything they both believed in. It was about not letting Evanora win.</p><p>So she wouldn't take the bait, right? She wouldn't throw away the deal for the easy payoff.</p><p>Besides, why would she insist on making the marriage seem more believable if she'd been considering leaving? Could that have been before Evanora contacted her? Or was that just her closing act, her final effort at making the story plausible before she vanished?</p><p>But everything had seemed <em>alright</em> after the date. Slightly tense because of the kiss, sure, but not like Rio had one foot out the door. For fuck's sake, she'd invited Agatha to work in the garden with-</p><p>Agatha's thoughts came to a screeching halt, heart lurching mid-beat.</p><p>The garden.</p><p>That had to be it. That was the moment. She'd let herself unravel, foolish and raw, and made Rio uncomfortable in the arrangement. Maybe Rio hadn't meant to pull away before that, but vulnerability had a way of turning everything murky. Harder to manage. Too complicated.</p><p>And maybe Evanora had offered her an escape just as things got too <em>real.</em></p><p>A pulse of nausea rolled through her.</p><p>She was spiraling. She knew it. Every theory was built on another theory, suspicion fed suspicion until she didn't know what she was looking for or what she was hoping to find.</p><p>Her hand clenched again, and the business card creaked under the pressure.</p><p>This wasn't proof. It was a fucking scrap of paper that had coincidentally fallen into her hands. It was a distraction from the real problem - <em>her</em>.</p><p>She hadn't been <em>rejected</em>. She hadn't asked for anything, hadn't said the words. She'd only tried. And Rio, for all Agatha knew, was simply trying too, in her own way.</p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened.</p><p>She couldn't go to Rio with this. Couldn't hold up a stupid business card with her mother's name on it and accuse the woman of betrayal just because the silence felt unbearable.</p><p>No. If she made this a thing, if she gave voice to all the worst possibilities, she'd never be able to take it back.</p><p>And so, after a long moment, Agatha bent down and dropped the card gently back on the floor where she'd found it, just slightly off to the side as if it had been kicked or shifted naturally by someone's passing steps.</p><p>She stared at it for a heartbeat. Then another.</p><p>She was overreacting, searching for shadows when there weren't any.</p><p>She forced herself to believe that and then stepped away, leaving the card behind like a secret she hadn't seen, and tried not to look back.</p><p>Then another four days passed.</p><p>Four days of pretending she hadn't touched it. Four days of watching Rio out of the corners of her eyes, dissecting every word, every pause, and every absence of eye contact. Agatha hadn't confronted her, hadn't even casually mentioned the card that had disappeared from the hallway the moment Rio returned home. Because what would she say?</p><p>The only thing she could come up with was, <em>Hey, I found my mother's business card on the floor and decided to build an entire paranoid fantasy about it.</em></p><p>Not the best opening line.</p><p>By the fourth day, it had begun to feel like maybe Agatha really had imagined it all. Rio hadn't said anything. She'd remained present but distant.</p><p>So maybe the card truly meant nothing. Maybe Rio had gotten it from someone as a joke. Maybe she'd accepted it with an eyeroll and immediately crushed it into the ball Agatha had found. There were dozens of harmless explanations. She tried to believe one of them.</p><p>She almost succeeded.</p><p>Until that evening.</p><p>They were cleaning up after dinner, just her and Nicky. Rio's chair sat untouched across the table, perfectly aligned, too neat. It stared at Agatha like it had something to say, like it was waiting for someone who had no intention of coming back.</p><p>She must've looked at it one time too many because as she reached for the plates, Nicky spoke, quiet and careful, as if he'd been turning the words over in his mouth for days.</p><p>"Did you and Rio fight?"</p><p>Agatha blinked, her hand hovering above the last plate. "What?"</p><p>"She's been weird," Nicky said, his fingers wrapping around the glasses, keeping them steady as he avoided her gaze. "Not like bad weird, just different. She skipped movie night."</p><p>He wasn't accusing, but there was sadness in his voice. A tentative, familiar sort of sadness that hinted at fear - fear that the delicate thing they'd all built was breaking again.</p><p>Agatha forced her hands to move, stacking the plates even as her heart stumbled over itself. "One of Rio's coworkers got sick," she said. It was true, or at least, a part of the truth. "She's been helping out at the bar. Picked up some extra shifts so Alice didn't have to."</p><p>"She's there now?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Nicky stared at the chair like it might give him a different answer. "So... you're not mad at her? For talking to Grandma?"</p><p>The plates in Agatha's hands shifted sharply, ceramic scraping in a discordant clatter as her grip faltered. She recovered quickly, but not before the sound had sliced through the quiet.</p><p>"What do you mean, baby?" she asked, keeping her voice soft. Too soft.</p><p>Nicky's gaze lifted, cautious now, reading her with eyes that had always been a little too perceptive. "I saw them. After practice on Friday."</p><p>Agatha's breath caught in her throat.</p><p>Friday.</p><p>The day after she'd found the card. The day it had vanished from the hallway like a figment of her imagination.</p><p>"I thought that was why Rio came," Nicky went on, voice lighter and almost apologetic. "That maybe you... didn't wanna see Grandma."</p><p>Agatha tried not to focus on the fact that her son had accurately read her relationship with her mother at the age of ten. It wasn't hard, considering that the weight of his words had settled over her shoulders like wet wool. Stifling and uncomfortable.</p><p>"They were near that tree where the snack table usually goes," he added. "I knew to look there 'cause Rio waved when she came before practice ended. Grandma came later."</p><p>Agatha mulled over the words. If they hadn't come together, then there was a chance that Evanora had ambushed Rio, forcing her into a conversation. But she had no way of knowing that Rio would be the one picking Nicky up, not with the abrupt change of plans caused by Agatha's workload. So either the ambush was for Agatha, and she'd miraculously dodged that bullet, or Rio had told Evanora about her whereabouts.</p><p>Neither of those options felt reassuring.</p><p>"What were they talking about?" she asked carefully.</p><p>Nicky hesitated. "Dunno. You said not to eavesdrop."</p><p>Right. She knew raising her son to be a decent human would eventually bite her in the ass.</p><p>"I did."</p><p>"They were too far anyway," he added unhelpfully. "But Rio didn't look happy. She kept doing that thing where she crosses her arms and looks away, like when she's pretending she's not mad, but she totally is."</p><p>He made the expression, a dead-on mimic of Rio's bristling restraint.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. Her throat felt dry.</p><p>"Did she say anything after?"</p><p>"Nope," Nicky said. "She didn't talk in the car, like <em>at all. </em>It was weird 'cause she always asks about practice, but she let me pick the music."</p><p>Agatha nodded, but her pulse thudded in her ears. Her fingers were cold around the plates.</p><p>Nicky turned to leave for the kitchen, humming something low under his breath, unaware that every word had dislodged something in her. Something big.</p><p>She didn't know what Evanora had said. She didn't know what Rio had replied.</p><p>But she knew Rio had spoken to Evanora and hadn't said a word about it.</p><p>She knew she couldn't let it slide anymore.</p><p>The next morning, Agatha moved like a ghost in her own home.</p><p>She had scraped together a meager three hours of sleep, if that, and when the alarm went off, it felt like she'd only just closed her eyes. It should've been fine. She'd gotten by on less sleep before - finals, grueling cases, Nicky's stomach flu that one cursed March - but this was different. This wasn't physical tiredness that she could power through with caffeine and stubbornness. This was the kind that lived in her bones, deep and heavy.</p><p>Her limbs were heavy, her thoughts disjointed, but she went through the motions anyway. She made Nicky's breakfast and packed his lunch on autopilot. She poured her coffee and drank it without noticing whether it was bitter or burned. She found herself in the car, engine rumbling and headlights casting shadows on the wall, with no recollection of how she'd gotten there.</p><p>The day passed in a blur of half-listened phone calls and unopened case files, her brain far too full of everything that wasn't work. She'd barely looked up when Billy poked in to confirm a court date; she nodded without hearing the details, not wanting to look at another reminder of what she had to do.</p><p>Which was confronting Rio.</p><p>The thought pulsed like a heartbeat at the base of her skull, persistent and inescapable. It hadn't left her alone all night. She'd tossed and turned beneath the sheets, tangling herself in them, heart thrumming in time with every creak of the floorboards. At 2:16 AM, when she heard the garage door come to life, her muscles had gone rigid with instinct.</p><p>Every cell in her body wanted to bolt from the bed, march into the kitchen, and corner Rio against the fridge, demanding the truth. She could see it clearly: the refrigerator light painting Rio in sharp blue, the unspoken things between them finally said out loud, even if they came out ugly.</p><p>But she hadn't moved.</p><p>Instead, she'd stayed frozen under the covers, trying to match her breaths to the hush of the house like Rio might somehow hear her shaking. She'd stared at the ceiling until her vision blurred, replaying every detail: the card, the conversation Nicky witnessed, and the silence. The fucking silence.</p><p>As much as she wanted to scream at Rio, accuse her of betrayal and cowardice, and throw every other word she'd swallowed in the past days in her face, she couldn't.</p><p>There was no proof - no direct admission or a bank slip, or a signed deal that she could hold against the woman. She had no physical evidence she could present, like she would do in court to win a case she didn't want to be a part of.</p><p>But that didn't really matter.</p><p>Because Rio hadn't told her. About the card, about the conversation, about anything.</p><p>And <em>that</em> was its own kind of betrayal.</p><p>Agatha hadn't bared her scars just to have Rio walk hand-in-hand with the woman who'd made them. She hadn't lowered her voice and let the cracks show, just to be left bleeding and unseen. She hadn't let herself <em>hope</em> - even for one reckless second - just to be proved right about what people always did when they saw the mess beneath the surface.</p><p>They left. Or worse: they stayed just long enough to twist the knife. To make sure it hurt before they disappeared.</p><p>If Rio had taken Evanora's money, then fine. Agatha could deal with that, eventually. She could sever the arrangement, wielding a pen like a scalpel as she signed the divorce papers. A precise signature. A final cut. But she should've said so, not let Agatha stew in the silence, wondering what she'd done to deserve the slow anguish.</p><p>The silence, above everything else, hurt the most.</p><p>And yet, a part of her still wanted to be wrong. Still hoped there was a reason why Rio hadn't told her, a context she couldn't see. That there had been a good explanation, even if it wasn't good enough.</p><p>But she wouldn't get that answer by waiting.</p><p>She'd been circling the question for four days now, raw and exhausted, her mind chewing itself to pieces. It was only a matter of time before she broke.</p><p>She was already unraveling.</p><p>So, when an emergency court delay cleared her afternoon, Agatha didn't return to the office. She walked out of the courthouse with her jaw tight and her pulse louder than traffic, white-knuckled hands gripping the steering wheel as she climbed into the car. The air inside felt heavy, like everything around her knew something was about to break.</p><p>She drove home on autopilot, the city blurring past the windows without leaving an impression. Her heart pounded harder with every turn, every red light, every second she got closer to the truth. By the time she pulled into the driveway, she wasn't sure if the trembling in her limbs was from adrenaline or dread.</p><p>She didn't text Rio.</p><p>She didn't <em>want</em> to.</p><p>She didn't want Rio expecting the conversation, didn't want her rehearsing responses or softening her tone or - worst of all - vanishing before Agatha could even ask. If there was going to be a confrontation, it had to be unfiltered. Unavoidable.</p><p>This wasn't going to be gentle.</p><p>It would be like ripping a Band-Aid off a wound that never healed - bloody, swollen, and still festering beneath the surface. She would welcome the pain. She craved it. Because pain was information. It meant she wasn't imagining it all.</p><p>Even if Rio screamed that her heart had never been in the deal the same way Agatha's had.</p><p>Even if she admitted the marriage was always a calculation, not a commitment.</p><p>Even if she said Agatha's clumsy attempts at honesty had made her rethink the entire arrangement.</p><p>It would still be better than the silence.</p><p>Better than the thousand questions pacing in Agatha's mind like wolves, their teeth growing sharper every day.</p><p>She needed answers, even if they broke her. Even if they confirmed everything she was afraid of.</p><p>And so, when she walked into the house, ready for war, she expected the kind of silence that made the sound of her own heartbeat seem loud, ready to fill it with screams and fury.</p><p>Instead, she heard voices. Muted by the walls and closed doors, but distinct.</p><p>One of them was low and firm, shaped by bristling restraint.</p><p>The other was cool, polished, and unmistakably familiar.</p><p>Agatha's blood turned to ice.</p><p>Evanora.</p><p>She took one slow, careful step down the hall, breath shallow, body tight with tension. The voices drifted from the living room, quiet but tense. It was a wonder they hadn't heard her car pull up the driveway or the garage door open.</p><p>Agatha's hand found the wall to steady herself.</p><p>The timing left little to the imagination. She wasn't supposed to be home for another hour. Whatever was happening wasn't meant for her ears.</p><p>Still, she tilted her head and listened.</p><p>"-generous than my daughter," Evanora said, every word sharp and cold. "I can double whatever she offered, and we can get this farce over with."</p><p>Agatha's stomach turned over, bile rising in her throat. Her breath hitched, caught somewhere between disbelief and fury as the silence stretched.</p><p>Then Rio spoke, her voice laced with disdain. "Of all the things I'd call you, generous isn't one of them. And I <em>highly </em>doubt you'd be able to double anything Agatha's given me. Since, you know, basic human decency isn't exactly your currency."</p><p>Evanora let out a soft, condescending laugh. "Don't insult my intelligence by pretending she's given you anything other than money. I imagine it's quite the relief - no more scraping by for car repairs or wondering how you'll cover medical bills. But eventually the loss outweighs the gain."</p><p>"Do you even <em>know </em>what caring about other people looks like?" Rio shot back, and Agatha could almost see her face - jaw tight, brows furrowed, teeth clenched to keep from shouting. "I didn't ask for a damn thing. She <em>gave</em> it because she <em>wanted</em> to. Because she cares. Not that you'd understand that."</p><p>There was a pause, thick and humming with tension.</p><p>Then Evanora tsked gently, mockingly. "Oh, dear. No need to get defensive. It's sweet, really, but you're smarter than that. Broken people are incapable of caring. They can mimic it, sure. Even convince others that they're being genuine. But in the end, they <em>always </em>destroy what they touch."</p><p>Agatha's palm pressed closer into the wall, fingers digging into the plaster as the words hung in the air.</p><p>"You're right," Rio said, making Agatha's breath freeze in her lungs. "Broken people have trouble caring. But there's something you're not seeing."</p><p>"Oh?" Evanora hummed, light and amused. Agatha could imagine the cold smirk on her lips.</p><p>"Agatha isn't broken. And if you had even a scrap of self-awareness, you'd recognize what it takes to survive the kind of damage <em>you</em> do to people. The fact that she's even remotely functional after the war you waged on her since childhood only speaks of her strength."</p><p>There was a beat, heavy and full of anticipation.</p><p>"I understand why it bothers you," Rio added, still sharp, still laced with venom. "You tried breaking her over and over again, and she always came out of it stronger. Unknowingly, you've built someone resilient <em>and </em>caring, and you hate that. You hate that, despite your cruelty and coldness, she's still capable of gentleness and warmth."</p><p>Evanora didn't speak right away. The silence crackled, filled with static fury, as though Rio's words had struck a nerve so deep even Evanora didn't know how to hide it fast enough.</p><p>Then came a quiet, clipped exhale. "My, my," she said at last, her tone no longer amused but glacial. "You've certainly grown comfortable in your role, haven't you?"</p><p>Rio didn't answer.</p><p>"A wife," Evanora continued, her voice low and lethal. "So loyal. So <em>devoted</em>. I've always known my daughter was an excellent manipulator, but I suppose I never expected her to trick someone into thinking she's worth... anything, really. Especially not more than the check I'm willing to write."</p><p>Rio's breath caught, so subtle that Agatha almost didn't hear it. But she did. That small inhale, taut and stifled like the last line of restraint before something snapped.</p><p>Agatha could picture her now, standing her ground with fists clenched at her sides, jaw locked, fury tempered only by willpower.</p><p>"Don't talk about her like that," Rio growled. "You don't know her."</p><p>Evanora scoffed. "I <em>raised</em> her. I know exactly how good she is at twisting the truth and making people see her in ways she can benefit from. And from this conversation, I understand that she's chosen to play the victim with you. A smart move, really, considering your protective nature, but it's performative. Something to keep you from seeing how rotten she is beneath all the sob stories and imagined wounds."</p><p>There was the sound of clicking heels and the rustle of fabric as Evanora glided across the living room floor. Agatha imagined her circling Rio like a wolf waiting to strike.</p><p>"My patience has its limits, Rio," she added calmly. "You may think you love her, maybe even believe she loves you too, but it's temporary. She'll get what she wants and leave you like she always does because Agatha doesn't see <em>people</em>. She sees pawns. All I'm trying to do is get you out of this situation before she ruins you."</p><p>Agatha's fingers had gone numb where they pressed into the wall. Her heart beat so loudly she could hardly hear the voices anymore.</p><p>"Well, aren't you just a sweetheart?" Rio drawled, sarcasm dripping from her words like venom. "So thoughtful and caring while trying to destroy your daughter's marriage. They should name you Mother of the Year."</p><p>Evanora scoffed again. "This farce is hardly a marriage."</p><p>"Why? Because we're both women? Or because the idea of Agatha being happy makes you break out in hives?"</p><p>"Because marriage is a choice," Evanora hissed, and Agatha could practically <em>hear</em> her eye twitch at Rio's insolence. "And nobody in their right mind would choose her. Not for a partner, not for a daughter. You'll see, eventually, and you'll regret not listening. You'll regret not taking the money and running for the hills when you had the chance."</p><p>To Agatha's surprise, Rio laughed, the sound light and unbothered.</p><p>"Just because you weren't smart enough to choose her doesn't mean everybody else is that stupid," she said. "This conversation isn't going anywhere, and I'd appreciate it if you stopped hounding me. You're not scary, Evanora. You're <em>pathetic</em>."</p><p>A sharp gasp, followed by a shuffle of movement, made Agatha step back on instinct, her heart in her throat. She retreated a few steps down the hall and ducked into the garage just as Evanora's heels sounded in the hallway.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>Agatha held her breath, eyes wide as she braced her hand against the door, ear pressed into the cold wood.</p><p>Evanora left with the rustle of fabric and a click of the front door.</p><p>And a moment later, Rio's footsteps echoed in the opposite direction, slower and heavier as the stairs creaked under her weight.</p><p>Agatha stayed where she was, motionless. Her lungs burned, her chest ached, but she didn't move.</p><p>Rio hadn’t taken Evanora’s money. She defended Agatha even when she didn’t know she could hear it. She didn’t think Agatha was broken but resilient.</p><p>The conversation didn’t answer all the questions simmering on Agatha’s tongue, but it interrupted the silence that had been eating her alive.</p><p>And Agatha knew she had to act before it settled between them again.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Her legs moved before she gave them permission.</p><p>She stepped into the empty hallway, the air thick with the acidic residue of her mother's fury and Rio's blazing contempt, a chemical reaction that hadn't quite settled. It buzzed around her like static, tense and unfinished, almost alive.</p><p>Agatha didn't let herself stop to stand in it. She couldn't.</p><p>She knew the wrong emotion would take over if she paused and let herself feel too much all at once. And there were so many of them crowding her ribs that she couldn't tell which one was the sharpest.</p><p>She needed answers.</p><p>And she needed them from Rio.</p><p>Because how could she be angry at someone who had just gone to war on her behalf? How could she still feel so hurt by the secrecy when the defense had been so raw, so visceral, that it made her knees weak?</p><p>Rio's voice had been laced with fierce defiance, dripping with unwavering loyalty. It could've been a declaration if Agatha had stopped to think about it.</p><p>But it had also come after days of distance, evasions, and lies by omission.</p><p>And <em>that</em> was what twisted the knife in her gut. She'd bared parts of herself she usually kept wrapped in steel, and in return, Rio had stood quietly in the shadows and spoken with her mother. Behind her back. Behind her scars.</p><p>Her hand slid up the banister like she needed the support. Her heels struck the stairs, each step echoing louder than the last. She moved toward Rio's door like it had its own gravity, yanking her in before she could second-guess herself.</p><p>She didn't know what she wanted out of this conversation, but it didn't matter. Whether it was an explanation or a meek apology, it would still be better than simmering in the silence filled only by guesswork.</p><p>She raised her fist and knocked. Too hard.</p><p>Pain exploded through her half-healed knuckles, a sharp, unnecessary reminder of her last serious conversation with Rio. But this time would be different. This time, Agatha wouldn't let her heart take the lead.</p><p>"Shit," she hissed, pressing her palm against the yellowing bruises, breathing through the sting. She tried again with her foot, the thud dull but urgent. "Rio!"</p><p>Her voice cracked, just slightly. Enough for Agatha to hear it and hate herself for it.</p><p>The silence stretched for one unbearable heartbeat.</p><p>Then the handle moved, and Agatha's spine went rigid.</p><p>The door opened slowly, the creak cutting into the hush like a blade. Rio stood in the doorway, barefoot, hoodie sleeves pulled halfway over her hands like she'd been trying to disappear into the fabric. Her eyes, tired and bloodshot from lack of sleep, widened when they landed on Agatha as if, despite hearing her voice, she didn't expect to see her on the other side.</p><p>"You're home," she whispered, almost to herself, as if the sight of Agatha standing in the hallway didn't feel real. Agatha watched the realization sink in - saw it in the way Rio's shoulders tensed and her breath hitched slightly before she forced it out through her nose. Her voice was calm, but wary, like she already knew what was coming. "You heard."</p><p>Agatha didn't answer. She didn't nod.</p><p>The words lingered between them like a lit fuse.</p><p>Rio's hand stayed curled around the door handle. Her knuckles had gone white. "How much did you hear?"</p><p>The fuse burned up.</p><p>And Agatha exploded.</p><p>"<em>Why</em>?" she growled, the crack in her voice from earlier returning, only sharper now, twisted with heat and something raw. "So you know how much damage control you have to do? So you can weigh the odds and decide if salvaging this is worth the effort?"</p><p>Her fists curled, pressing into her thighs as she tried to ground herself against the rising tide inside her.</p><p>"It doesn't matter how much I heard," she spat. "What matters is that there was anything <em>to </em>hear."</p><p>The breath she pulled into her lungs felt like ice.</p><p>"You <em>talked</em> to her. Behind my back. You knew - you <em>fucking knew</em> - what she's done to me. You <em>saw</em> what she still does to me. And you didn't say a damn thing. You just started pulling away without a word, and let me think it was me. That <em>I'd</em> said too much, done too much. That I'd ruined this."</p><p>Her eyes burned, but she blinked fast, refusing to let the tears spill. She wouldn't cry now, not when her whole chest felt like it might crack in half.</p><p>"I want to be angry," she snapped, her voice breaking under the strain. "I <em>am</em> angry. You let me stew in the silence for days. You let me spiral. You let me believe I was alone in this. That you were already halfway out the door, and I was just too pathetic to realize it."</p><p>She dragged in a breath, jaw tight, every inch of her vibrating with everything she hadn't said over the past five days.</p><p>"I found the card," she said, softer but no less pained. "I <em>found it, </em>Rio. And when Nicky told me he saw you together, I was ready to cut you loose. I told myself you'd taken her money. That you were never really here. I was <em>ready</em>."</p><p>She paused, swallowing hard, the ache in her throat threatening to win.</p><p>"But then I heard you. Just now," her voice was unsteady, eyes finally locking onto Rio's, as if only now daring to search for the truth there. "You defended me. Like I was <em>yours</em> to defend. Like you gave a fuck. And I don't know what to do with that. I don't know how to hold both those things at once - the silence and the loyalty. The betrayal and the way you spoke about me like I mattered."</p><p>The silence that followed was suffocating. Agatha stood there, fists clenched at her sides, every emotion exposed like an open wound.</p><p>"So I need you to explain," she finally added, her voice nearly a whisper. "Everything. Because I can't handle the silence anymore."</p><p>Another beat passed before Rio took in a shaky breath, letting it out through her nose. "I didn't take anything from her. I'd never betray you like that. I need you to know that."</p><p>Her voice was soft, not quite pleading but close, like she couldn't bear the thought of Agatha thinking anything different.</p><p>"Then why not tell me? Why lie by omission for <em>days</em>?"</p><p>Rio flinched. She didn't retreat, but she looked away, down at the floor between them.</p><p>"I didn't want to make it a thing," she admitted. "I knew she could've offered me the moon and I wouldn't take it. I figured it wouldn't matter as long as I didn't give it weight."</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw. "But you <em>did</em>. You gave it weight by pulling away. By letting it hang between us and keeping me in the dark."</p><p>Rio's mouth opened, then closed again. She looked at Agatha like she was trying to find the right door inside her and failing. "I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't want you to think I was-"</p><p>"But you still did it," Agatha snapped, her voice cracking. "You still let her <em>talk </em>to you. You let her twist things."</p><p>"I didn't let her twist <em>me,</em>" Rio said, stronger now. "It didn't matter what she offered. I only cared about what she said because it wasn't true. I know who you are. I <em>see you</em>."</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched.</p><p>Rio looked at her then, <em>really </em>looked. "She's been trying to make me doubt you for days. And I told her to fuck off every time."</p><p>For a second, the house held still. There was only the quiet thrum of something cracking between them, not breaking but splintering under the weight of everything unsaid.</p><p>Agatha's hands were trembling. She didn't know what she wanted. To yell? To cry? To pull Rio into a hug or shove her away?</p><p>Rio stepped back, leaving the door wide open.</p><p>"Come in," she said softly. "If we're gonna talk, let's talk."</p><p>Agatha crossed the threshold before she could second-guess herself, letting the door click shut behind her and seal them in the quiet tension.</p><p>Rio didn't speak right away.</p><p>She moved toward the edge of the bed, fingers gripping the hem of her hoodie as she sat, elbows on her knees, spine curled like she was trying to fold herself into something more manageable. Her gaze stayed on the floor.</p><p>Agatha didn't sit.</p><p>She stood near the center of the room, arms crossed tightly over her chest as she watched Rio - confident, assertive Rio - try to make herself smaller. It felt wrong.</p><p>"She first showed up after one of my classes," Rio said at last, voice quiet but steady. "About three weeks ago, I think. Before our date."</p><p>Agatha said nothing, jaw set.</p><p>"She didn't make any offers then," Rio continued, thumb rubbing anxiously at a loose thread on her sleeve. "Just... talked. Said she knew the marriage was fake. That I should cut my losses before the ship sank. Said there was no use pretending."</p><p>Her mouth twisted like the memory tasted bitter. "I wanted to ignore her. Walk away. But I knew her PI had been watching us, and for a moment, I thought - maybe - we slipped. That she knew something real. Something dangerous."</p><p>Agatha could feel her stomach coiling tighter with every word. That familiar nausea returned, the kind bred from too many years of being blindsided by half-truths.</p><p>"I couldn't tell what she knew was real," Rio said, her voice growing quieter. "Most of it sounded like her own warped assumptions, but I didn't want to risk it. So I took the card. I thought maybe... maybe it could be useful. A trap we could turn inside out."</p><p>"You thought about telling me?" Agatha asked, her voice low but taut.</p><p>"I did," Rio looked up at her, eyes soft and tired. "I did. But I knew I wasn't going to contact her, so it felt like unnecessary weight to dump on you. I figured if I just ignored her long enough, she'd get bored. Then I started thinking we needed to distract her. Throw her off."</p><p>"So you came up with the date idea," Agatha said, her tone like a blade being drawn. "You thought it could help cement the lie."</p><p>Rio nodded slowly.</p><p>"Did you tell her?" Agatha pressed, her heart hammering. "Did you <em>invite</em> her to come find us?"</p><p>"No!" Rio's head shot up, her voice laced with alarm. "No. I didn't know she'd be there. I swear, Agatha. If I had, I would've warned you."</p><p>The sincerity in her voice was clear. It struck Agatha somewhere between the ribs and spine, but it did nothing to slow the fury simmering in her veins.</p><p>She forced herself to breathe, but her mind was racing ahead. Back to that night.</p><p>"She didn't call me," Agatha said slowly, realization cutting through her thoughts like a scalpel. "She said to expect her call, but she didn't call <em>me.</em>"</p><p>Rio hesitated.</p><p>"She called on Sunday," she admitted, her gaze dropping again. "When I went to my room to clean up. She said she'd grown impatient waiting for me to contact her. Wanted to lay out her offer directly. I only stayed on the line for a minute or two."</p><p>Agatha's stomach turned. "And then you started pulling away."</p><p>Rio winced. "I didn't mean to. I swear I didn't. After what you told me in the garden, I just..." She swallowed, voice unraveling with guilt. "It felt like you'd just handed me something raw and bleeding, and if I dropped this on you right after, it would be like digging my fingers into your wounds. So I told myself I'd handle it. Quietly. That I'd tie it up with a neat bow and come back to you with the mess already cleaned."</p><p>Her voice dropped to almost a whisper.</p><p>"But I couldn't. She kept calling at weird hours, leaving messages, asking to meet. Always pushing. I didn't know how to balance it all. I didn't know how to protect you <em>and</em> tell you everything. So I froze. I pulled back when I should've leaned in. I'm sorry."</p><p>Agatha took a slow step back like she needed space to breathe. There was a lot to unpack in that alone, but she needed the full story.</p><p>"And at Nicky's practice?"</p><p>"I figured telling her to fuck off in person would work better. We were supposed to meet after my classes, but then you asked me to pick him up, and-" Rio sighed, running a hand over her face. "I didn't want to meet her there. Didn't want her that close to Nicky. But she showed up anyway, and I bit the bullet. Told her to leave me alone, blocked her number, and decided to tell you."</p><p>Agatha pressed her folded arms into her chest. "But you didn't. I had to find out from <em>Nicky</em>."</p><p>"I know," Rio said tiredly. "The timing never felt right. I knew it would be a long conversation, a heavy one, and I was barely home because of work. I was going to tell you today, but then she showed up and, well..." She gestured between them vaguely, her voice frayed. "Everything just imploded."</p><p>Agatha nodded jerkily. She could feel her pulse in her teeth. In her wrists. Her arms stayed folded so tightly against her chest that it was like she was physically holding herself together.</p><p>She'd gotten the full story, but it didn't help. It didn't untangle the knot in her stomach or cool the heat blistering under her skin. Because even after all of it - after the honesty, the guilt, the remorse - one thing still screamed inside her:</p><p><em>You still left me alone with it</em>.</p><p>"You were going to tell me," Agatha echoed, her voice quiet but biting. "But you didn't. For days."</p><p>Rio flinched.</p><p>"You decided what I could and couldn't handle. You chose to <em>manage me </em>like I was some fragile project and not a person who's in this with you."</p><p>"Agatha-"</p><p>"No." Her voice cracked down the middle, and this time she didn't try to hide it. "You don't get to <em>Agatha</em> me like that. Like you didn't disappear behind your silence and leave me fumbling in the dark."</p><p>She took a step forward now, her eyes shining with fury and pain. "Do you have any idea how that felt? To think I'd been too much? Too needy? To lie in bed at night, wondering if I'd ruined something by opening up? Fucking hell, I thought I scared you away."</p><p>Her fists trembled now, no longer folded but clenched at her sides.</p><p>"I told you things in the garden I've never told anyone," she said, voice rising. "Things that still hurt to speak aloud. I let you see parts of me I've spent years trying to stitch closed, and you looked at them like they were <em>beautiful</em>. Like they weren't something to be ashamed of. So when you said you wouldn't leave, I believed you. And then you fucking pulled away, making me think it was <em>me.</em>"</p><p>Rio's expression crumpled, stricken. "It <em>wasn't</em>. It was never you-"</p><p>"But you let me believe it was!" Agatha snapped. "You let me sit with that silence and build stories out of it. You let me think I was unlovable, that I made you <em>uncomfortable</em>. And I was ready to walk away just to spare myself the humiliation of staying where I wasn't wanted."</p><p>Her breath hitched. The next words nearly caught in her throat, but she pushed through them anyway, because they were real, and they were rising whether she wanted them to or not.</p><p>"And then you said all that shit to her," she said, her voice trembling like it was barely holding together. "About me. About what she'd done. And how I came out of it."</p><p>She shook her head, laughing once - soft and broken - like she couldn't believe she was saying any of this out loud.</p><p>"And I realized..." Her voice caught, and she looked away, the weight of it all crashing in like a wave too big to outrun. "I realized that maybe... maybe I'm not unwanted."</p><p>The words fell from her lips like a truth she'd carried for too long, too quietly.</p><p>"And I won't find out by pushing you away. I <em>can't</em> keep pushing you away just to see if you'll come back. I don't want to miss you again like I did this week. I don't want to keep walking around with this hollow ache, thinking about everything I didn't say when I had the chance, living in this limbo of wanting, but never having."</p><p>Rio didn't speak.</p><p>She didn't move.</p><p>She just <em>watched</em>, like even her breath might fracture the moment.</p><p>Agatha pressed her arms tighter across her chest, grounding herself. "I tried," she said, voice quiet but certain. "I tried to draw lines. Build the walls. I told myself it was temporary, just an arrangement. A performance. That getting too close to you would only make it harder to let go when the time came."</p><p>Her eyes flicked back to Rio, shimmering with unshed tears. "But I didn't expect you to be <em>you</em>. I didn't expect you to turn out to be this kind, patient person who somehow made staying away harder than leaning in. Who taught Nicky how to make pancakes after knowing him for like two minutes. Who made it so <em>fucking hard</em> not to want more whenever you looked at me like I mattered."</p><p>She took a breath, slow and deliberate, like preparing to step off a ledge.</p><p>"I need to say this before it swallows me whole," she whispered. "Before I convince myself that I imagined it. That the way you listened in the garden or defended me today didn't mean what I hope it did."</p><p>She held Rio's gaze, vulnerable and unguarded.</p><p>"This stopped feeling fake a long time ago."</p><p>The words dropped between them like a thunderclap - loud and irreversible.</p><p>Rio blinked like she'd been hit by a wave she hadn't seen coming. Her mouth opened, closed, then opened again, but no sound came. Her jaw flexed like she was working through a thousand words she hadn't quite found the shape of yet.</p><p>Then, she stood up, slow and measured, like she was approaching something easily spooked.</p><p>"You weren't imagining it," she said quietly, stepping forward. Her hands were at her sides, fingers twitching like she wanted to reach out. "I look at you like you matter because you <em>do</em>. You matter to me more than I ever expected. More than I let myself believe I was allowed."</p><p>Agatha's breath caught.</p><p>Rio took another step closer, her voice still barely above a whisper, like speaking louder might crack the fragile thing hanging between them.</p><p>"You're a very... complex person, Agatha." There was a flicker of something - fondness, exasperation, awe - all tangled in a small smile. "Quite hard to read, sometimes. There were at least a hundred times when I thought you felt the same way."</p><p>Her gaze held Agatha's, unwavering. "And another hundred when I couldn't remember why I thought that in the first place."</p><p>Agatha flinched, just barely. Her lips parted, a breath of a word or an apology caught behind them, but Rio lifted her hand slightly in a quiet gesture - <em>wait</em>.</p><p>"I don't blame you," Rio said softly. "I know the world hasn't been kind to you, and there was so much to consider here. So many variables. It wasn't a clear-cut relationship, not with the contract, your mother, and everything we could've lost if the other person wasn't on the same page. Blaming you for being cautious would be hypocritical."</p><p>She let out a shaky breath, her smile turning bitter at the edges. "But it kept me up at night. I spent so much time trying to convince myself that I was reading into every glance, every brush of your hand. I told myself I was just <em>wanting</em> too much, like that was something shameful."</p><p>Her voice broke, and she paused, swallowing hard before continuing.</p><p>"But then you'd laugh at something I said, like you forgot to be careful around me. Or you'd stay in the kitchen just a little longer than you had to, pretending you were finishing your tea, but I knew you were just... <em>there</em>, with me. And I'd fall all over again into something I wasn't supposed to want."</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the floor like she couldn't bear the weight of it for a second. But when she looked up again, her eyes were different, clearer.</p><p>"But I still did," she said, the words ringing out like a vow. "I still wanted even when we weren't speaking. Even when you shut me out, and I told myself it was just business. When we agreed to be just friends. When I watched you trust me with your scars in the garden. I wanted for days, weeks, <em>months</em> in a way that was so all-consuming, so deep, that no amount of time or distance could've made me <em>stop</em>."</p><p>She stepped in, close enough that Agatha could feel the heat of her breath, her voice falling to a whisper that felt louder than a shout.</p><p>"So you're right: this stopped feeling fake a long time ago. And I don't want to pretend that it ever could be anything but real. Not anymore."</p><p>Agatha didn't speak. She didn't need to.</p><p>Because she was already moving, already closing the final inch between them as her hand curled into the front of Rio's hoodie, their lips crashing like a storm that had been gathering for months and <em>finally</em> broke.</p><p>It wasn't tentative.</p><p>It wasn't polite.</p><p>It was desperate and soft and too much and not enough all at once.</p><p>Rio made a sound - half relief, half wonder - and kissed her back like it was instinct, like it had been in her chest this whole time, waiting for permission to become something real.</p><p>And Agatha felt it - <em>all of it </em>- rush in like the air after a long-held breath.</p><p>This time, there was no audience, no performance, no cold street air or distant footsteps. No Evanora to cut the moment short.</p><p>There was just Rio. And her.</p><p>And the weight of everything they'd been holding back.</p><p>The kiss wasn't steady. It wasn't measured or elegant like the one outside the restaurant, the one that had felt like being loved while knowing she wasn't. That kiss had been too careful, delicate like a lie wrapped in silk.</p><p>No, this was different.</p><p>Agatha kissed as if it meant survival. Like her chest had been hollow for months, and this was the first breath she could actually keep. Her hand curled into Rio's hoodie like she didn't trust the ground to stay beneath her without something to hold on to.</p><p>And Rio <em>answered</em>, meeting her in it, pulling her closer with a kind of trembling certainty that made Agatha's heart ache. There was no curated grace in this kiss, no reverence in the way Rio's fingers dug into her hips.</p><p>Just heat. Want. Truth.</p><p>Rio's mouth moved against her almost feverishly, hungrily, like she could make up for every second they'd spent afraid or pretending. And Agatha pressed into it, her body fitting into Rio's like it <em>belonged </em>there, and everything she'd tried so hard to suppress came roaring to the surface - every glance, every almost-touch, every swallowed feeling, every night she'd told herself this was fake. Every lie unraveled in the space between their mouths.</p><p>There was no cold now. No distance.</p><p>No masks.</p><p>Only the soft gasp Rio made when Agatha's hand slid up her back. Only the wild rhythm of both their hearts crashing into each other.</p><p>Only <em>them</em>.</p><p>And when they finally pulled apart - breathless, lips tingling, chests heaving - Agatha didn't move far. Her forehead rested against Rio's, eyes closed, hand still fisted in her hoodie.</p><p>Rio smiled - a slow, stunned thing that Agatha felt more than saw.</p><p>And for a beat, everything was still. Warm. Quiet in a way that wrapped around her, soft as a blanket.</p><p>But then reality set in - complicated, raw, and heavy.</p><p>And suddenly, the quiet wasn't soft anymore. It was <em>loud</em>.</p><p>Agatha's stomach twisted. She could feel her heartbeat spike, not with adrenaline this time, but with the creeping edge of panic, sharp and familiar. Her fingers, still curled in the fabric of Rio's hoodie, loosened. She blinked hard and stepped back just enough to look at her, not enough to break contact.</p><p>"I-" she started, then stopped, teeth catching on her bottom lip. "This changes things."</p><p>Her voice cracked at the edges, not from regret, but from fear. Real, clawing fear.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, thumbs brushing slow, soothing circles against Agatha's hips. "I sure hope so. I don't kiss my friends like that."</p><p>But Agatha didn't laugh. Couldn't. Her breath came in short, uneven puffs as the weight of it hit her, and she stepped back, out of Rio's arms and the warmth. The loss of contact felt immediate and wrong, but she couldn't stop.</p><p>"I don't know how to-" she faltered, shaking her head, arms crossing tight over her chest like she needed armor. "I'm terrible at relationships. I scare people away. I push too hard or shut down completely. I'm stubborn and guarded and <em>decidedly</em> not good at this."</p><p>She gestured between them, wild and helpless, like the space that had once been fake had turned too real and was not too big to carry.</p><p>"I told you before - I don't know how to do <em>easy</em>, Rio. I don't know how to not ruin things. And this..." Her throat bobbed. "You matter. You matter <em>so much</em>. Nicky <em>adores you</em>. And I- I can't lose you."</p><p>She started pacing, one hand raking through her hair, the other clenched tight at her side.</p><p>"What if you think you know what you're getting into, but you <em>don't</em>? What if I'm too much? What if the worst parts of me haven't even shown up yet, and when they do-"</p><p>"Agatha-"</p><p>"I'm <em>broken</em>, Rio." The words ripped out of her like they'd been living in her ribs too long. "You told my mother I wasn't, but I am. There are parts of me that will <em>always</em> be broken. Ugly. Bleeding. Unfixable. And maybe you don't see them yet, but you <em>will</em>. People always do."</p><p>She turned toward her, eyes shining, voice fraying. "And then they leave. Which - fine. Fucking <em>fair</em>. But I don't want <em>you</em> to leave."</p><p>"<em>Agatha-</em>"</p><p>"I didn't plan for this. I don't have a clean, graceful way to navigate it. I can try, but you deserve someone who already knows <em>how</em>. Who isn't hauling around a tangle of defense mechanisms and anger issues. Who doesn't need a manual just to exist in your orbit without spiraling. Someone who isn't messy and twisted and-"</p><p>"Agatha!"</p><p>It wasn't quite a shout, but something sharp enough to cut through the noise.</p><p>Agatha froze mid-step, blinking as she stared at the door in front of her. Unknowingly, she'd been getting ready to leave. To run like she always did.</p><p>"Look at me," Rio said, not as a command, but as an anchor.</p><p>Slowly - almost like it hurt - Agatha turned.</p><p>Rio was standing still by the bed, arms at her sides, gaze unwavering and full of something so <em>steady</em> it made Agatha ache. Her voice gentled even further when she spoke again. "You keep saying you don't know how to do this. That you're too much. But what if you're not?" She took a step forward, deliberate, slow. "What if you're <em>exactly</em> enough, and all this fear is just an echo of someone else's voice pretending to be your own?"</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, chest rising and falling too fast.</p><p>Rio stepped closer again. "You say you're not good at easy. Good. Like I said during dinner with your mother, I don't want easy. I want <em>real</em>. I want you exactly as you are. Twists and scars and sharp edges and all."</p><p>Another cautious step forward brought her right into Agatha's space.</p><p>"Remember our talk on the patio? When I asked you to help in the garden?" Agatha nodded, unable to form any words under the weight of Rio's sincerity. "I meant every word. There are countless versions of this that we can try, and I'm more than okay with that."</p><p>She lifted a hand, gentle as a breeze, brushing it against Agatha's cheek. "But you'll have to let me try with you. Let me stay. Not in spite of everything but <em>because</em> of it."</p><p>Agatha didn't mean to cry.</p><p>She didn't even realize she <em>was</em> crying until Rio wiped a tear away with the pad of her thumb, tender and careful, like she was afraid of breaking something precious.</p><p>"Okay?" Rio whispered.</p><p>And for a second, Agatha didn't answer.</p><p>She just looked at her - really looked, in a way she'd never let herself before - and felt something in her chest unravel. Not break. Just... let go.</p><p>Then she stepped forward, cupped Rio's face with both hands, and kissed her like it was a promise. Like she was terrified, and still choosing her anyway.</p><p>And Rio kissed her back with the same aching honesty.</p><p>Not easy.</p><p>
<em>Real.</em>
</p><p>When they separated again, Agatha didn't sever the contact. Her hands slid from Rio's face with aching slowness, like her fingers didn't quite want to let go. They wandered, unsure, searching, until one slipped into the softness of Rio's hair, cradling the back of her head, and the other found its home between her shoulder blades. She pulled her in, close and careful, and held her.</p><p>It wasn't hesitant. It wasn't fleeting.</p><p>It was the kind of hug that meant something. That felt like the hush after a storm.</p><p>Rio melted into her without resistance, arms winding around Agatha's waist as though they'd been waiting for this alignment all along. The sight that escaped her lips - small, quiet, content - warmed Agatha's shoulder as they stood there, suspended in the moment.</p><p>A beat passed. Then another. The silence felt comfortable for the first time in over a week.</p><p>And then Rio mumbled into Agatha's shirt, voice muffled but unmistakably amused, "You know, I think this is the first time we've hugged."</p><p>Agatha let out a surprised laugh that caught somewhere between her chest and throat. "Jesus," she murmured, her cheek pressed lightly to Rio's hair. "That's actually true, isn't it?"</p><p>Rio gave a soft hum of agreement, arms still firm around her, like she didn't want the conversation to cause her to move away. "We've lived together for five months, slow danced in a room full of your coworkers, fake-kissed in front of your mother, and somehow <em>never</em> managed to do this."</p><p>Agatha squeezed her tighter. "I think I was scared this would feel too real."</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Then Rio whispered, "It <em>does</em> feel real."</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. "It is."</p><p>The panic slowly dulled into something gentler, something like <em>hope</em>, before her phone buzzed sharply in her back pocket, cutting through the stillness like a ripple across calm water.</p><p>"You're off the clock," Rio groaned into her shoulder, voice muffled and petulant. "Do millionaires not believe in work-life balance?"</p><p>Agatha chuckled, angling her head to press a quick kiss into Rio's hair before silencing her phone. She stepped back just enough to see her face, arms finding a new purchase around her waist.</p><p>"It's my alarm," she said, smiling even as she sighed. "I have to pick up Nicky."</p><p>Rio made a face, dramatic and unrepentant. "Right now?"</p><p>Agatha laughed again, freer now, the sound still shaky around the edges but real. "Really? One kiss-"</p><p>"<em>Multiple</em> kisses," Rio interjected, matter-of-factly.</p><p>"-and a hug," Agatha continued, eyes dancing, "and suddenly you're a clingy mess?"</p><p>"I am <em>not</em> clingy," Rio said with mock offense, crossing her arms, though the soft gleam in her eyes betrayed her. "I'm emotionally invested. There's a difference."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes fondly, blindly reaching for the door handle. "Notice how you didn't argue with the mess part."</p><p>"I pick my battles," Rio grinned, but her smile turned more serious as she reached out, catching Agatha's wrist gently before she turned to leave. "We should talk when you get back," she said softly. "About... this. Us. What it means. Where we go from here."</p><p>Agatha paused, her expression thoughtful. "Yeah. We should."</p><p>Their eyes held for a beat too long.</p><p>Then Rio leaned in again - just briefly - and kissed Agatha like it was punctuation. Simple and sure.</p><p>When she pulled back, Agatha's eyes fluttered open, dazed but steady.</p><p>"Try not to spiral without me, okay?" Rio said, only half-joking, her voice low with the kind of fondness that made Agatha feel <em>seen</em> in all the dangerous ways.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, lifting a brow in mock offense. "When have I ever done that?"</p><p>Rio opened her mouth with far too much enthusiasm, and Agatha rolled her eyes, cutting her off.</p><p>"That was rhetorical," she muttered, already heading down the hall. "I promise to try and keep my spiraling at bay."</p><p>Rio smirked, leaning back against the doorframe like she'd won something. "That's my girl."</p><p>Agatha froze for a microsecond - blinked once - then resumed walking like the comment hadn't made her knees weak.</p><p>Thank <em>God</em> she was already out of the room when Rio said it. Otherwise, Nicky would have to catch a ride with Wanda or start training for a marathon.</p>

<p>The silence settled in the house again, but it was different this time.</p><p>It didn't press against Agatha's ribs like it was trying to crack them open. It didn't echo with all the things she hadn't said. This silence was... still. Gentle, even. The kind that created space for breath, for thought. For the fragile sort of peace that came only after something momentous.</p><p>Agatha stood barefoot in the kitchen, hands methodically transferring the slices of cinnamon streusel from the pastry box to a plate. Tremors danced beneath her skin, making the task harder as her fingers trembled with everything that had transpired.</p><p>She had kissed Rio.</p><p>Multiple times. Right after admitting she couldn't pretend anymore.</p><p>And Rio had kissed her back like it meant everything. Like it was an answer to a question they'd been too afraid to ask.</p><p>The high had followed her all the way to Nicky's school - warm and dizzying, like she'd downed champagne on an empty stomach. She'd caught herself smiling at a red light, fingers brushing her mouth like she was checking it was still hers. Like the shape of it had changed.</p><p>And maybe it had. Everything else certainly had.</p><p>Because for the first time, she didn't have to hold back. Didn't have to convince herself it was fake. She was allowed to <em>feel</em> it. Let it live in her chest without fear of it slipping through her fingers.</p><p>But even so, it made the promise she'd given Rio - <em>try not to spiral without me</em> - feel like a Herculean task.</p><p>Because now, in the hush of the evening, with Nicky tucked into bed and Rio waiting in the living room - not as a housemate or co-conspirator, but something Agatha wasn't quite ready to name - the reality crept in.</p><p>This wasn't pretend anymore.</p><p>There was no script to follow. No convenient lie to lean on in case everything blew in their faces.</p><p>This was raw. Alive. <em>Real.</em></p><p>The kind of real that made her want to run and cling to it in equal measure.</p><p>She exhaled slowly and looked down at the plate, studying the streusel. The crumbs clung to her fingers, and she moved to wash them off under the sink before pressing her palms to its edge.</p><p>She had imagined this - the aftermath of the kiss, the unspooling honesty - a hundred different ways. But none of those daydreams accounted for how terrifying it would be to <em>have</em> what she wanted. To be seen so clearly and still held.</p><p>Rio was waiting. In the other room, with two cups of tea steaming on the coffee table, she just sat there, ready for a conversation after weeks of avoiding it.</p><p>Agatha flexed her hands. Swallowed. Then grabbed the pastries, two smaller plates, and two forks before turning to the living room like she was approaching a firing squad instead of a woman she'd kissed just hours ago.</p><p>Her heart pounded loud enough to echo in her ears with every step.</p><p><em>Stupid</em>, she thought. <em>Absolutely fucking ridiculous.</em></p><p>The hard part was supposed to be over. She had taken the step, had let herself want, and acted on it. She'd kissed Rio. She'd admitted the truth that had sat in her bones for months.</p><p>And still, her palms were sweating.</p><p>She had stood in courtrooms and dismantled men who owned entire city blocks. She'd exposed corruption, made enemies with dangerous names, and held her ground when people twice her size tried to shout her into submission.</p><p>But now?</p><p>Now, she was setting down the plates and forks with hands that shook just enough to make everything clatter, like a clumsy little drumroll announcing how entirely unprepared she felt.</p><p>This wasn't a hostile witness or a court brief or a corrupt executive she could slice clean with her words.</p><p>This was Rio. Kind, patient, maddeningly steady Rio, who had kissed her like a promise and held her like she wasn't a grenade waiting to go off.</p><p>And, somehow, that made everything worse.</p><p>Because Agatha could handle people hating her. It came with her line of work, and she'd grown used to the glares sent her way as she left the courtroom. Being hated meant being good at her job.</p><p>But being wanted? Truly, deeply wanted?</p><p><em>That</em> was new. And it was terrifying.</p><p>
<em>Get a fucking grip, Harkness.</em>
</p><p>She set the pastries down, adjusted the plates, adjusted them again, then finally sank into her usual chair to Rio's left.</p><p>She could feel brown eyes following her every move, but she didn't meet them, stubbornly staring at the coffee table until a mug of tea entered her vision, cautiously slid across the wooden surface like a peace offering.</p><p>"Is emotional growth on the agenda?" Rio asked teasingly, withdrawing her hand to take a piece of the streusel. Her movements were light, unburdened, and Agatha wondered if she'd prefer the woman to be as nervous as she was.</p><p>Then she figured there was no room for another emotional wreck in this discussion.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she shifted in her seat and forced her shoulders to ease back against the chair. "Either that," she said, attempting a shrug that came out stiffer than intended, "or a hard conversation. We'll see how it goes."</p><p>Rio leaned back into the sofa, balancing the smaller plate on her knee while she twirled her fork lazily between her fingers, watching her with that infuriating mix of curiosity and patience.</p><p>"You make it sound like those are mutually exclusive," she said, nudging her fork toward Agatha's untouched tea. "In my experience, hard conversations breed emotional growth. Especially when there's cinnamon streusel involved."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, finally glancing up at her. "Just how many conversations in your life included cinnamon streusel?"</p><p>Rio shrugged easily. "None. But sweets have always been encouraged." She took another bite, then fixed Agatha with a look that was almost too direct, like she'd been saving it for when the room went still enough to hear it. "So. Are you gonna tell me what's going on in your head, or should I start guessing?"</p><p>Agatha's fingers curled loosely around her mug, though she still hadn't taken a sip. "Weren't you the one who asked for this conversation?"</p><p>Rio tilted her head with a teasing smirk. "Answering a question with a question? How lawyer-y of you," she said before her expression softened, the hand toying with her fork stilling. "I did ask. Because we have a knack for leaving things unsaid until they gain too much weight to carry," she paused, her eyes finding Agatha's. "And I hope we won't do that anymore."</p><p>The word <em>anymore</em> fell onto the table right between Agatha's untouched plate and Rio's mug. It was a marker, an opening door leading to something unknown.</p><p>Something more permanent. More hopeful.</p><p>Something <em>real</em>.</p><p>Agatha's fingers flexed around the mug. "There <em>is</em> a lot to discuss," she said slowly, each word deliberate. "Our situation's already... complicated. This will add new layers. New difficulties."</p><p>"Yeah," Rio nodded, unflinching. "It's definitely unorthodox, but we'll figure it out. One step at a time."</p><p>Agatha wished she could borrow that certainty, bottle it, and drink it, but she stayed silent.</p><p>"We can establish some ground rules," Rio added after the pause stretched for a beat.</p><p>The words struck harder than Agatha expected.</p><p>Suddenly, she was back in Rio's cramped old apartment, the air thick with tension and the hiss of a machine that sounded like it was dying. She'd sat across from Rio with a contract and a set of carefully drawn boundaries - lines meant to keep their arrangement clinical, safe, impersonal. She'd built a fortress out of rules.</p><p>And here they were again, talking about them.</p><p>The truth pressed sharply into her chest: their relationship - fake or not - would never be free of constraints. Not until the contract ended. Not until the money changed hands. No matter how much they wanted to pretend otherwise, this was never going to start like a normal relationship. And parts of it would never <em>be</em> normal.</p><p>Agatha shook the thought away.</p><p><em>Every </em>relationship needed boundaries. It was better to set them now than stumble through the months ahead like they'd been doing so far. Even if the idea left a bitter taste on her tongue.</p><p>"Alright," she said, leaning back. "We should probably start with the most obvious part."</p><p>"Which is?"</p><p>"The contract." The words were heavy, unwelcome. Relationships came with rules, sure, but not with<em> legal clauses</em>. Not usually. "We cannot let this get in the way of holding up our end of the bargain."</p><p>Rio set her plate aside and shifted to face her fully. "You mean we can't back out if this doesn't work out."</p><p>It wasn't a question, but Agatha nodded anyway. "It's imperative that we separate our real relationship from the one on paper. Personal entanglement can't interfere with our credibility."</p><p>"Spoken like a true lawyer," Rio said, but her voice was more tired than amused. "Does that mean you want to draft another contract or something?"</p><p>Agatha considered it briefly before shaking her head. "It could backfire if my mother got her hands on it." She noticed the way Rio's jaw tightened at the mention, so she softened her voice. "And... I don't want this to start with another contract. I want it to be <em>ours.</em> Our rules. Not another piece of paper."</p><p>That earned her a small nod, enough to smooth the tension from Rio's posture. "Alright. So, no matter what happens, we see the deal through. What else?"</p><p>"I think we shouldn't... inform Nicky," Agatha said quietly. "Whatever this is, it affects the house - and him. Whenever things shift, he notices. And there's been a lot of shifting lately. I don't want to overwhelm him."</p><p>"I understand that." Rio tapped her nails against the mug. "And for the record, I wasn't exactly planning on telling him I made out with his mom," she added, grin tipping toward trouble.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "We didn't <em>make out</em>," she muttered, heat creeping up her neck.</p><p>Rio leaned forward, her smirk widening. "Mhm. I think the jury would call it at least three separate counts."</p><p>Agatha fixed her with a look. "I meant we shouldn't let this... <em>change </em>in our physical relationship affect how we act around him. That means no displays of affection."</p><p>"So, no making out during movie night?" Rio asked, faux-innocent.</p><p>"Stop saying 'make out' like you're seventeen," Agatha grumbled. "But yes - no kissing, touching, nothing that makes him ask questions we're not ready to answer."</p><p>Rio hummed, a sound that was half agreement, half amusement. "You know, it's kinda presumptuous of you to think I'd ambush you in the kitchen while we haven't been on a real date yet."</p><p>"Nobody said anything about ambushing," Agatha noticed, the corners of her lips twitching upwards despite the exasperation in her voice. "But that brings us to the second part."</p><p>"How to navigate this when we're already married?" Rio guessed, earning a small nod. "Yeah, I thought about that too."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>Rio reached for her plate again, digging into the half-eaten pastry. "Honestly? I think we should treat it like a new relationship."</p><p>Agatha raised a sceptical brow. "While married and living under the same roof?"</p><p>"It's not like we share a bedroom," Rio shrugged, her fork cutting another clean bite. "And I know it won't be <em>exactly</em> like a new relationship. But some things still apply, like going on actual dates."</p><p><em>Dates</em>.</p><p>The word made Agatha's mind flicker to the handful of times they'd spent together outside the house, most - if not all - engineered for appearances. Her work gala. Alice's birthday. The restaurant. She figured the closest thing to a voluntary outing had been Nicky's games, even if they still spent them pretending.</p><p>Something in her chest tightened at the idea of going on a proper date with Rio.</p><p>Rio swallowed her bite and went on. "We spend plenty of time together, sure. But it's always here. Household stuff. We've never really had time that's just for us."</p><p>Agatha's instinct was to argue, to remind her they'd had plenty of dinners at the table, but she knew it wasn't the same. Those evenings had been a byproduct of living together with a boy who insisted that meals should be a group affair. They had nothing to do with intention.</p><p>"I think we need that if we're going to make this work," Rio added, tone softening. "Otherwise, it's just... more of the same, and we'll both get stuck in the routine."</p><p>Routine was safe. Predictable. Agatha had lived her entire adult life wrapped in it like armor. And yet, looking at Rio now, with her eyes bright and posture loose, she wondered if safety was worth the cost of never letting anything grow.</p><p>"You're right," Agatha said after a beat. "Just because we have... history, doesn't mean we should skip certain steps."</p><p>Rio smiled proudly, leaning back into the couch. "Damn. I think this is the first time you admitted I was right about something."</p><p>"Don't get used to it," Agatha said without hesitation, raising her mug to mask the smile tugging at her lips. "Besides, even a broken clock is right twice a day. It was only a matter of time."</p><p>"Way to ruin my moment," Rio laughed, the sound soft and light enough to pull at Agatha's heartstrings. It was infuriating - how Rio could do something as simple as <em>chuckle</em> and make the air between them shift without saying a word.</p><p>Agatha swallowed the tea before drumming her fingers against the ceramic. "Dates are fine, but we should probably keep in mind that any public outing will result in scrutiny."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching her closely. "We can stick to the house if you want."</p><p>"You<em> just</em> said that wouldn't work," Agatha noticed. "And I agree. We want to build something real, and we can't do that if we let the deal dictate our moves. We... deserve a proper date. A proper relationship, even if the beginning was less than normal."</p><p>Rio stayed quiet for a beat, chewing on the last bite of the streusel before setting the plate down.</p><p>"I'd say the beginning was quite normal," she said eventually, eyes glinting in the living room's soft light. "You miraculously ended up alone at the bar where I work. I used my charm to get you to open up. We talked for hours, and I asked you out. It's a rom-com in the making."</p><p>Agatha raised her brows with an unamused scoff. "You and I remember that night <em>very</em> differently."</p><p>"Do we?"</p><p>"Yeah," she uncurled her fingers from around the mug and lifted her pointer finger. "One, you didn't use any charm. You <em>annoyed</em> me into talking to you."</p><p>"That <em>is</em> my charm," Rio protested with a smirk. "And you fell right into the trap."</p><p>"Two," Agatha's middle finger joined the first, "we talked for maybe forty-five minutes, all about how I needed to marry someone. That's not exactly meet-cute material."</p><p>"Not with that attitude."</p><p>Agatha ignored her, straightening her thumb. "And lastly, you didn't ask me out. You gave me a napkin with your phone number."</p><p>A napkin that was still tucked into the top drawer of her nightstand, edges worn soft from the number of times she'd unfolded it. But Rio didn't need to know that.</p><p>"Which you used," Rio pointed out smugly.</p><p>Agatha waved her hand dismissively. "That's not the point. The point is you didn't ask me out."</p><p>"God, I'd hate to be on the receiving end of this in court," Rio muttered, though there was an unmistakable warmth in her gaze. She studied Agatha for a beat, as if weighing whether to say something, before leaning back into the couch. "I would've, you know."</p><p>Agatha frowned. "Gone to court with me?"</p><p>"Asked you out," Rio clarified, her fingers drumming a lazy rhythm on the armrest. "When we first met. That's why I came over in the first place."</p><p>"You're a bartender," Agatha deadpanned. "Your <em>job </em>is approaching people at the bar."</p><p>Rio's smile curved slowly, deliberately. "Sure. But I don't make a habit of sticking around. Normally, I pour the drink and disappear. That night? I stayed."</p><p>The words hung between them, simple, but heavier than they had the right to be.</p><p>Agatha felt the memory surface, unbidden. The suffocating smell of beer, the counter's stickiness as she braced her arms against it, and the low thrum of conversation from the men playing pool in the bar's corner.</p><p>And Rio, unbothered by Agatha's scalding glares and cutting words, as she poured her drinks and slowly, surely, broke down her walls.</p><p>She hadn't admitted it at the time - wouldn't have admitted it even to herself - but there'd been a pull. Otherwise, she wouldn't have indulged Rio's curiosity. She wouldn't have opened up enough to encourage the proposal.</p><p>And maybe that should have been a sign in itself. Maybe they were destined to end up right here, in the living room, discussing how to navigate something real.</p><p>Agatha shifted in her chair, bringing the mug to her lips if only to buy herself a few seconds. "So, Alice told you there was an asshole moping at the bar, and you immediately decided that was your type?" she finally asked, the question sharper than she intended.</p><p>Rio's smirk curved. "Oh no," she drawled, "I was fully prepared to avoid you. Even considered putting up a self-service sign so you could pour your own drinks." Her fingers stilled their idle tapping, flattening against the armrest as her eyes skimmed Agatha like she was remembering the scene in detail. "But then I saw you - this gorgeous, sharp-edged businesswoman in a suit that probably cost more than my monthly rent - and I figured the risk of getting my head bitten off was worth the possibility of walking away with your number."</p><p>Her voice quieted at the last part, losing the tease for something steadier, heavier. And Agatha, despite herself, felt the heat crawl up the back of her neck.</p><p>"And yet, you didn't walk away with my number," she grumbled, raising the mug again to hide her reddening cheeks.</p><p>"Didn't get my head bitten off either. A win is a win," Rio said. "Besides, I <em>did</em> end up married to you a few weeks later. Not getting your phone number seems small in comparison."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at that. "Yes, you deserve a pat on the back for being my only option."</p><p>"I wear it like a badge of honor," Rio replied without hesitating, before her expression softened. "But I mean it. If you were just drinking away some work problems or a shitty day, I would've asked you out," she paused, a glint of mischief in her eyes. "Or at least propositioned you."</p><p>A bark of laughter escaped Agatha's mouth before she could push it back down. "And they say romance is dead," she drawled, shaking her head.</p><p>Rio's smile grew at the sound of Agatha's laugh, like she'd just won a round in a game only she knew they were playing.</p><p>Agatha perched her mug against her knee, fingers curling loosely around the handle. "If things had been different," she said, the words feeling heavier than they should, "I probably would've said yes."</p><p>Rio blinked, the shift in tone catching her off guard. "To the proposition or the date?"</p><p>"Either. Maybe both," Agatha's lips twitched, though her gaze stayed on the ripples in her tea. "I suppose there's a silver lining in the way it all played out. If you were just another stranger, I doubt we'd get this far."</p><p>There was a beat of quiet as Rio considered the words, her eyes unwavering and calm as they searched Agatha's face. "You think we wouldn't have worked without the forced proximity?"</p><p>"I think," Agatha said slowly. "I wouldn't have let us find out." She finally lifted her gaze, meeting Rio's head-on. "Looking back, I can admit there was a pull at the bar. I felt it that night, too. But it was mostly physical. And I know myself well enough to know I wouldn't have given it a chance to bloom into... any of this."</p><p>Rio's lips pressed into a thin line - not displeased, but thoughtful, like the admission didn't wound so much as stir something deep. Her fingers started tapping against the armrest again.</p><p>"You're probably right," she said finally, her tone softer than Agatha expected. "Back then, I don't think I would've pushed, either. Not past a night together or maybe a couple of dates, if you'd even let it get this far."</p><p>Agatha's brows knit, though she didn't interrupt.</p><p>Rio's gaze drifted for a moment, like she was searching through the memory of that night. "I wasn't looking for anything serious then. You know my schedule can get crazy between classes and work, and I was happy with the occasional one-night stand to take the edge off. A relationship seemed too... time-consuming."</p><p>Her lips curled faintly, but there was no humor in it. "I would've asked you out because I wanted to. Because you were - <em>are</em> - stupidly beautiful. And if you'd said yes, I would've enjoyed myself. I would've enjoyed the idea of this stunning, refined woman finding me interesting enough to spare me a second glance. But I wouldn't have tried to make it last."</p><p>Her eyes flicked back to Agatha, steady and unflinching. "It took living with you - arguing with you, laughing with you, finding you barefoot in the kitchen at one in the morning making tea - to make me realize I wanted more than just a night. That I wanted <em>you</em>."</p><p>Agatha's throat tightened, the weight of Rio's words pressing heavier than she cared to admit. She shifted in her chair, adjusting the mug against her knee like it suddenly needed perfect balance.</p><p>"Quite the speech," she said lightly, her tone clipped enough to mask the stir in her chest. "If plants don't work out for you, maybe you should consider theater."</p><p>Rio's mouth tugged into a crooked half-smile, not fooled in the slightest. "Deflection noted."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though it lacked real bite. "I'm just saying - you make it sound like some grand love story, when in reality it was me being desperate and you being opportunistic."</p><p>"Mm. And now here we are," Rio said easily, like she wasn't the least bit bothered by the jab. She reached for her tea, eyes warm and slightly amused. "Funny how desperation and opportunism make a pretty decent foundation."</p><p>Agatha huffed, breaking eye contact to stare at her mug. "Anyway," she said, clearing her throat, "dates?"</p><p>"Yeah," Rio chuckled, letting the moment go as she sipped her tea. "I hear those are standard in most modern relationships."</p><p>Agatha gave her a flat look. "You make it sound like a scientific trial."</p><p>"Maybe it is," Rio countered, clearly amused. "Control group: married but not dating. Experimental group: married and dating. We'll compare the results."</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, but the corner of her mouth betrayed her with the smallest twitch. "For a scientist, you plan very flawed studies."</p><p>"Not if we do it right," Rio said, leaning in just slightly, her tone softening into something more earnest. "Not just sharing a roof and a water bill. Actual effort. Planning time together the way people do when they're just starting out."</p><p>"It feels..." Agatha shifted, searching for the right word. "...backwards. I already know more about you than most people I dated."</p><p>"Maybe," Rio admitted, "but it might be the only way forward. We can't go back and start over, but we can choose to build something on purpose instead of by accident."</p><p>Agatha sat with that for a moment, her mug cooling against her palms. The logical part of her brain wanted to dissect it, poke holes in it, argue about feasibility. But another part - the part that remembered how steady Rio's body felt pressed against hers just hours ago - wanted to agree without reservation.</p><p>She'd started trusting Rio months ago. There was no point in stopping now.</p><p>"Alright," she said at last, letting out a slow breath. "So, no breaking the contract, no telling Nicky, and dates. Do you want to add anything else?"</p><p>Rio nodded, her expression sobering in a way Agatha rarely saw. "Communication," she said firmly.</p><p>Agatha went rigid, the word lodging in her throat like a lump she couldn't quite swallow. It hung between them, deceptively small yet impossibly heavy, gaining weight with every second it took her to respond.</p><p>Finally, she managed to force out, "I may not be an expert at relationships, but even I know that's a given."</p><p>She tried to tack on a smile, something cocky and light, but it felt brittle on her face.</p><p>"Is it?" Rio's voice softened but remained steady. "Because we've both done a fantastic job of <em>not</em> saying things. It took us literal months to even get here." Her pointer finger drew a small, controlled circle between them. "We avoid, we deflect, and we swallow it down until it spills out sideways. It barely worked for something fake, and it won't sustain something real."</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth. She hated how easily Rio saw through her deflections and pushed against her defences until they cracked. She looked down at her cold tea, catching the faint tremor in her hand as it created ripples across the murky surface.</p><p>Her mind flipped through possible rebuttals, but the more she searched, the more they dissolved. Because as much as she loved silence, it wasn't safer. It created an illusion of safety until it folded in on itself, burying her under the debris.</p><p>Once again, Rio was right.</p><p>Rio leaned forward slightly, her voice gentle but carrying the weight of something unshakable. "I'm not asking you to pour your heart out the second you feel or think something. Just... don't shut me out. Don't leave me guessing. If something's wrong, say it. If you need something, ask. And I promise to do the same."</p><p>Agatha lifted her eyes at that, meeting Rio's steady gaze. There was no judgment there, no demand for perfection - only an unspoken plea: <em>don't make me build this blind.</em></p><p>Her lips pressed together, the automatic protest caught behind her teeth. She swallowed hard and, after a long pause, nodded once. "I'll try," she said, because she couldn't promise anything more, and she hated herself for it.</p><p>But Rio didn't flinch, didn't call her out for half-measures. Her lips curved in a faint, knowing smile, like she recognized the weight of those two words. "That's all I ask," she murmured, and there was a softness to her tone that tugged at Agatha's heartstrings.</p><p>It didn't surprise her that Rio remembered her words from the garden, when she'd admitted in a rare moment of raw honesty, <em>I'm trying, Rio. That's all I know how to do.</em></p><p>No, what hit her was the look in Rio's eyes - proud, like Agatha's willingness to try was better than any empty declaration she could've given.</p><p>It made Agatha feel dangerously close to crying, so she cleared her throat to dislodge the feelings stuck in it and took a big swing of her tea to wash them down.</p><p>"Great," she said, her voice steadier than her hands as the mug shook in her grip. "In the spirit of communication, I'd also like to know the next time my mother contacts you. Immediately."</p><p>Rio blinked, visibly caught off guard by the words. "I- um, yeah, of course," she stuttered out, uncharacteristically fidgety, like the mere thought made her squirm. "I suppose we should talk more about it. I-"</p><p>"That's not why I brought it up," Agatha cut in firmly. "My mother has already been too present in our relationship, and I'd rather not give her more thought than I have to." She leaned forward, catching Rio's wandering eyes. "But we're talking about rules to make this work, and this one is non-negotiable. If she so much as looks your way, let me know, and I'll deal with her."</p><p>Rio stilled, her easy compliance slipping into something more guarded. "Deal with her how?" she asked carefully. Her voice wasn't sharp, but it carried weight, as though she'd caught a whiff of something Agatha hadn't said out loud. "Because if you think I'm just going to stand by while she takes shots at you, that's not happening."</p><p>The pushback caught Agatha off guard. She wanted to snap back that it was her fight, her mother, and her mess to contain, but under Rio's gaze, the words curled on her tongue. Because the truth was more complicated than that.</p><p>She didn't want Evanora anywhere near Rio. Not just for Rio's sake, but her own. She didn't trust the woman not to twist things, not to plant doubts the way she always had. It wasn't paranoia; it was <em>precedent</em>. Her mother had a talent for turning strength into weakness with a single well-placed observation.</p><p>And Rio was strong, but she was also human. If Evanora found a crack to press against, Agatha wasn't sure what damage could be done. She wasn't willing to find out.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio said gently, like she could see the shape of the thought even if Agatha refused to voice it. "You don't have to protect me from her. I can handle it."</p><p>Agatha knew that. Of course she did. Rio wasn't fragile; she'd proven it again and again. And if the conversation Agatha had overheard hours earlier was any indication, she hadn't just handled Evanora, but dismantled her with spectacular precision.</p><p>But strength had limits. Agatha couldn't stop the thought from clawing inside her ribcage: how many conversations like that did Rio have in her? How many barbed remarks could she deflect, how many venomous truths could she swat away, before the poison started to seep in? Before even Rio's unwavering patience ran dry?</p><p>Because that was the thing about Evanora. She didn't need to be believed; she only needed to be relentless. And Agatha had seen that persistence wear people down her entire life. It wasn't even about loyalty, but about resilience, and although Rio's stability was undeniable, the thought of watching her slowly poisoned by Evanora's venom was too nauseating to stomach.</p><p>"I know you can," Agatha said eventually, her voice careful and measured to the point of artifice. "But if we're treating this as a new relationship, you shouldn't have to worry about her. She's my problem."</p><p>"Her involvement threatens the deal," Rio noticed calmly, "which means she's <em>our</em> problem."</p><p>Agatha stiffened, fingers tightening around her mug. "The deal is fake. <em>This</em> isn't. I don't want her reaching into the part that's real."</p><p>Rio's lips parted slightly, like she hadn't expected the clear distinction. She studied Agatha for a long beat before leaning forward, her voice low. "You know it's not that simple. Drawing a line between fake and real can work to a degree, but Evanora doesn't <em>care</em> about that line. All she cares about is power, and we'd be giving it to her by letting her dictate who gets to fight back."</p><p>"I'm not letting her dictate anything," Agatha growled, her knuckles turning white around the ceramic. "I'm choosing to deal with her because she's <em>my</em> mother and <em>my</em> responsibility."</p><p>Rio's eyes softened, but her voice stayed firm. "You call it responsibility, but it sounds a lot like punishment. Why carry her weight on your own when you have someone willing to help?"</p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened. "Because it shouldn't have to be something to worry about. She's ruined enough things in my life, and I won't-" She cut herself off, breath shuddering. Her gaze dropped to the tea in her lap, unable to finish the thought.</p><p>"Won't let her ruin this?" Rio supplied gently.</p><p>Agatha stayed silent, but that was answer enough.</p><p>Rio set her mug aside, bracing her elbow on the armrest to lean closer, as if closing the gap between them might press her conviction straight into Agatha's heart. "There's nothing your mother can do or say to change my mind about you. No threat, no bribe, no whispered venom will drive me off."</p><p>The words sank deep, grinding against the old instincts Agatha lived by - the ones told her to guard, deflect, and shoulder everything until it broke her. And yet, under the weight of Rio's steady gaze, something in her began to slip. The armor she'd spent decades polishing didn't shatter, but it cracked, leaving her exposed in a way that was both unbearable and oddly safe.</p><p>And with the crack, she found herself not just hoping, but believing, that Rio wouldn't let Evanora worm her way in - that she wouldn't be poisoned, or frightened off, or convinced that Agatha wasn't worth the trouble.</p><p>The realization left her raw, squirming under Rio's attentive eyes as she grasped for something to say and break the tension. But nothing came, and eventually, Rio's mouth curved slowly, deliberately breaking the heaviness with a spark of mischief.</p><p>"The only thing is that I <em>might</em> end up in jail for punching her the next time she goes too far. That's where your law degree comes in handy, right?"</p><p>Agatha huffed, but it sounded more relieved than exasperated. "Once again, I'm not that kind of lawyer," she pointed out, the corners of her mouth twitching up in a small, grateful smile. "But I'm sure I could find someone willing to negotiate a reduced sentence if you keep the assault clean."</p><p>"Noted. So, a broken nose at most," Rio said, only half-joking. "Maybe a few loose teeth if she says something particularly nasty."</p><p>Agatha let herself picture it - Rio's fist slicing through the air in a clean arc, colliding with Evanora's sharp nose in a wet, satisfying crack. She imagined the look of startled betrayal in her mother's eyes, the crimson rush down her lip, and Rio's calm, almost smug expression as she shook out her knuckles. The image warmed her in a way it shouldn't have, cathartic and dangerous all at once.</p><p>For a moment, she was genuinely tempted to give Rio the green light, to tell her that next time Evanora darkened the doorstep, she had full permission to swing.</p><p>But she shook it off and leveled Rio with a pointed look. "You are absolutely <em>not</em> allowed to punch my mother," she said, enunciating each word like it was a legally binding clause.</p><p>Rio's brows rose, her lips twitching like she was trying not to laugh. "Even if she deserves it?"</p><p>"She always deserves it," Agatha grumbled. "But she's an ex-senator, and an assault charge could derail your life."</p><p>"Eh, <em>derail</em> is a bit strong," Rio waved her hand dismissively, sinking back into the couch. "I'd figure out a way to finish my thesis in prison. <em>And</em> I look good in orange."</p><p>"Rio."</p><p>"Fine," Rio sighed like <em>Agatha</em> was being the unreasonable one. "No prison."</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. "No punching my mother."</p><p>"What about a singular, well-aimed slap?"</p><p>"No physical violence <em>of any kind</em>."</p><p>Rio groaned, but her grin gave her away. "Alright, I'll use words," she conceded, raising her hands in defeat. "Very sharp, very well-placed words that will hopefully end with a heart attack. Or a stroke."</p><p>Against her better judgment, Agatha felt her lips twitch. She pressed them together, but the smile threatened anyway, curling faintly before she could stop it. "This is supposed to be serious."</p><p>"I <em>am</em> serious," Rio said, the teasing edge in her voice melting into something steadier. "She deserves violence, physical or not. But... fine. I won't punch her, or slap her, or purposefully try to give her a heart attack."</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, some of the tension leaving her shoulders. "Great."</p><p>"<em>But</em>," Rio added, leaning forward, "that doesn't mean you get to keep carrying her alone. If she shows up, you tell me. And if she crosses a line, we deal with it together. Not for the contract, but for us."</p><p>"Rio..."</p><p>"You still deserve someone willing to fight for you. With you," Rio pressed, her words sharp with conviction.</p><p>The sentence hit like a tripwire. Agatha's breath caught as the memory flooded in - the bookstore/bar, the sharp taste of whiskey lingering on her tongue, Rio's voice steady in the low light as she'd said almost the same thing after Evanora's dinner interrogation.</p><p>The cadence was the same and yet different now. Rio's tone carried the weight of everything they had endured since: the forced silences, the stolen pockets of peace, the tentative trust that had begun to take root despite every reason it shouldn't.</p><p>It was the same promise, reforged. Stronger. Harder to ignore.</p><p>Back then, she hadn't known how to let someone fight with her. The thought of sharing Evanora's weight - <em>any</em> weight, really - had felt reckless, like inviting a crack into the armor she'd spent her life building. Weakness. Vulnerability. Dependence. All the things she'd taught herself to bury. It still felt that way now, raw and dangerous.</p><p>But Rio had told her she didn't need to know how; she only needed to want to try.</p><p>And wasn't that what everything between them came down to? Trying. Even when it scared her. Even when it felt impossible. Maybe she'd been trying longer than she cared to admit - every reluctant concession, every small moment of trust given despite herself. Maybe this was just another step, another mountain she'd learn to climb in time.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, forcing herself to meet Rio's gaze. "Then we'll add it to the list. No carrying things alone. No charging ahead without the other. And," her lips curved in the faintest smirk, though her voice betrayed the weight beneath it, "absolutely no punching my mother, no matter how tempting."</p><p>Rio's eyes sparkled with a dangerous kind of amusement. "Fine. But let the record show that I'm obeying under protest."</p><p>Agatha let out something between a scoff and a laugh, tension bleeding from her jaw. "Duly noted."</p><p>Rio folded her arms with exaggerated satisfaction, but her gaze softened again when it lingered on Agatha. "Good. Then I think we have everything. Dates, communication, no solo fights, and... trying."</p><p>That last word settled between them like a stone in still water, rippling outward, undeniable.</p><p>Instead of letting it fester, Agatha set her mug down with a low clink, cutting the moment short. "Alright," she said briskly, bracing her hands against the armrests. "Good talk, then."</p><p>Before she could rise, Rio's palm settled against her shoulder, firm and steady, holding her in place. "What are you doing?"</p><p>"You said we were done," Agatha replied, her tone light but not her pulse. She tilted her head, feigning nonchalance. "Do you want to shake on it? Draft a formal addendum to clarify the no-punching-Evanora clause before you conveniently forget it?"</p><p>Rio's lips quirked, though the hand on her shoulder didn't budge, brushing absent circles against the cotton shirt. "Why shake on it," she murmured, "when we could kiss on it?"</p><p>Agatha shot her a flat look, though the corners of her mouth betrayed her. "That's hardly binding."</p><p>"Stronger than a signature," Rio countered, eyes darting down for a moment. "At least I'd remember it."</p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh, shaking her head as if she could shake off the heat creeping up her neck. "You're impossible."</p><p>"Mm. And yet you agreed to date me," Rio said, letting her hand slide down Agatha's arm to entangle their fingers as she leaned back into the couch.</p><p>"Did I?" Agatha tilted her head, feeling Rio's grounding warmth seep into her skin. "Because I don't remember you asking."</p><p>"Oh?" Rio hummed, her lazy grin making something tighten in Agatha's stomach. "I figured that was a given, considering we just spent the evening discussing the rules for our relationship."</p><p>"A relationship that has yet to start," Agatha pointed out with a smirk. "The devil's in the details, darling."</p><p>The faint blush dusting Rio's cheekbones almost made her grin, but the woman recovered quickly. "So that's it, huh? You're really going to sit here and argue technicalities because <em>I </em>didn't ask?"</p><p>Agatha's smirk deepened, pleased at having gotten under her skin. "Details matter."</p><p>"They sure do," Rio muttered, narrowing her eyes in mock challenge. "Which is why there should be a date first. I'm not asking you to be my girlfriend without knowing exactly what I'm getting myself into."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "Right. Because we're practically strangers after five months under the same roof."</p><p>Rio tipped her head, gaze steady but playful. "I know plenty about my fake wife, my housemate, my friend Agatha Harkness." She let the words hang, then added with deliberate weight: "But I haven't met the <em>romantic</em> Agatha yet. That's the version I want to see."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, that treacherous warmth tingling at the back of her neck again. "And what if she doesn't exist?"</p><p>If Rio heard the tinge of worry in her voice, she didn't call it out. Instead, her fingers tightened slightly around Agatha's, grounding her with a quiet squeeze. "I refuse to believe a woman who can slow dance like you isn't capable of a little romance," she said, her teasing softened by something more certain. "But between you and me? I think you could ask me right here and I'd still say yes."</p><p>"You <em>think</em>?" Agatha repeated with a frown.</p><p>Rio chuckled, low and unbothered. "Well, I was trying to play it cool. Don't want to seem too eager."</p><p>Agatha's face smoothed over again, the shadow of doubt blooming between her ribs stifled by the openness in Rio's eyes.</p><p>She weighed her next words carefully, considering the path Rio had all but laid at her feet. She could take the easy out and ask here, now, in the safety of their living room. But something in her resisted - some instinct that if they were doing this, they deserved a beginning that felt intentional. Real.</p><p>"I'm not going to ask you to be my girlfriend," she said at last, her voice firm despite the tug she felt when Rio's hand twitched as if to retreat. Agatha held on tighter, steadying them both. "But... I'll ask something else."</p><p>Rio stilled, eyes wordlessly searching hers.</p><p>Agatha drew in a breath, the decision crystallizing in her chest. "Will you go on a date with me?"</p><p>The words seemed to hang in the air, fragile and undeniable. For the first time all evening, Rio didn't rush to fill the silence. She just looked at her, eyes dark and steady, as if she needed Agatha to see the weight of what she'd just done.</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to backpedal, to laugh it off, or call it a terrible joke. Her pulse thundered in her throat as she felt her muscles tighten in anticipation.</p><p>Then, slowly, Rio's lips curved - not into her usual lazy grin or the teasing smirk, but into something almost reverent. She gave Agatha's hand a deliberate squeeze.</p><p>"Yes," she said quietly as if afraid to shatter the moment. "Of course I'll go on a date with you."</p><p>The tightness in Agatha's chest broke open, replaced by something dangerously light. She hadn't realized she'd been holding her breath until it left her in a shaky laugh.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, still studying her like she was the only thing in the room worth looking at. "Should we shake on it?" she asked playfully, and another bark of laughter broke from Agatha before she could stop it.</p><p>"I think that's the kind of thing we should kiss on," Agatha mused, already tugging on their joined hands to draw her closer.</p><p>Rio's smile curved sharply at the edges, though her eyes were warm, molten. "Careful," she warned, leaning in, "your romantic side is showing."</p><p>"That's just the beginning, darling," Agatha murmured back, and before Rio could come up with another quip, she closed the last sliver of space between them.</p><p>The kiss was deliberate, unhurried, sealed with the same care as the promises they'd just made. Rio's fingers found their way to the front of her shirt, curling there like an anchor, and Agatha let herself sink into the warmth of it, into the steadiness she didn't know she'd been craving until now.</p><p>When they finally parted, foreheads brushing, neither of them moved to break the fragile quiet that wrapped around them. Agatha's lips tingled, her pulse loud in her ears, but for once, she didn't feel the need to fill the silence with words.</p><p>For once, trying felt like enough.</p><p>And a pretty good start.</p>

<p>Agatha glared at her laptop, entertaining the idea of finding whoever wrote the damned article currently staring back at her from the screen and asking them if the only meaningful relationship they had was with their cat. If she could even drag them out of their mother's basement, that is.</p><p>Her eyes scanned the headings written in some elaborate font designed to cause headaches, ignoring the unnecessarily long descriptions meant to sound fun and whimsical.</p><p>The page boasted about <em>100 Creative and Unforgettable Date Night Ideas</em>, but so far, Agatha wished she could forget every single one.</p><p>She scrolled down even further, grinding her teeth as another section of the list popped up, the ideas getting progressively worse.</p><p><em>Build a pillow fort</em>.</p><p>
<em>Play hide and seek.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Buy coloring books.</em>
</p><p>She glanced up at the page's address again to ensure it was about romantic outings and not play dates for kids. Maybe the author should look into why their idea of a date boiled down to a bunch of eight-year-olds during their first sleepover. It seemed like an issue.</p><p>Another heading stood out: <em>Go to an open mic night.</em></p><p>Agatha's glare could've curdled milk.</p><p>She imagined explaining that one to Rio: <em>Yes, darling, I thought we'd commemorate our first real date by listening to wannabe comedians and terrible poetry.</em></p><p>The worst part was the tiny, anxious voice whispering that maybe this was why she'd never done this properly before - that maybe romance was just one more thing she wasn't built for. After all, she couldn't remember the last time a date had consisted of something more than a dinner, skipping the dessert, and sneaking out of someone's apartment in the middle of the night.</p><p>She almost slammed the laptop shut, but her pride refused to admit defeat to a Buzzfeed knockoff. <em>This is important,</em> she reminded herself. <em>This is proof that you can be romantic. Normal people do this all the time without needing Google.</em></p><p>She stabbed at the trackpad again, lips curling at the next suggestion<em>. Go stargazing</em>.</p><p>"Great. Let me call the clouds and demand they stay out of the sky for our convenience."</p><p>She was still muttering when the door cracked open. Billy stepped in with a stack of papers pressed to his chest like a shield. "Uh... I brought the copies you wanted. And, um, you're talking to yourself again."</p><p>Agatha snapped the laptop half-shut as if he could see the cursed website from the other side of the room and narrowed her eyes. "It's the only way to talk to someone intelligent around here."</p><p>Billy hovered indecisively by the shut door, looking like a rabbit who had voluntarily walked into a snare and was now rethinking his life choices. "Is it something about work? I'm here to help."</p><p>"Yes, Teen, that's quite literally your job," Agatha growled, watching him cross the room over her glasses. His hands shook pitifully as he placed the papers in the furthest corner of her desk, glancing at her uncertainly. "It's a private matter."</p><p>Billy nodded too quickly, bobbing like a puppet whose strings had been yanked. "Right. Private. Got it. I didn't see anything."</p><p>"You <em>didn't </em>see anything because there was nothing to see," Agatha said crisply, folding her hands over the laptop like a dragon guarding its hoard.</p><p>He shifted on his feet, eyes darting across the desk. "It's just... You looked kind of frustrated, so if it's - well, if it's something I could, you know, <em>assist</em> with..."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. "Are you offering to help me with a <em>private matter</em>, Teen?"</p><p>"No!" Billy shrieked, looking close to a heart attack. "I mean - maybe? If you want me to?"</p><p>"I think you know the answer to that," Agatha said with a dismissive wave toward the door. "Leave. And don't bother me again unless something is on literal or metaphorical fire."</p><p>The kid evidently had the survival instincts of a dodo bird because he didn't move, eyes jumping aimlessly between her desk and the wall behind her. Only when she leaned back in her chair, folding her arms over her chest, did he flinch as if startled out of a daydream.</p><p>"Right. Out. Of course," he took a hesitant step back, fidgeting with the hem of his sleeve. "Just.. you know, if you were, like, looking up, um, <em>date</em> stuff-"</p><p>Agatha's muscles locked, her expression staying neutral only because years in court had trained her face into a weapon. Date stuff? How the fuck-? Did Rio tell him? They hadn't even discussed telling their friends yet. Surely, that was the kind of thing you talked about before unleashing the news.</p><p>Billy, tragically unaware of the danger, kept talking. "I mean, you probably know that already, but Rio likes simple things. Like food trucks, bookstores, that kind of thing. Nothing too... grand." His voice hitched nervously, panic creeping in. "Not that grand is bad! I know you have the means to spoil her, and she honestly deserves it, but she's kinda touchy about money, you know?" He gulped, and under different circumstances, Agatha knew she'd take tremendous pleasure in watching him squirm so much. "And like... obviously you don't <em>have to</em> do something she likes, with the contract and everything-"</p><p>Agatha frowned, her mind snagging. If he didn't know about her and Rio <em>actually</em> dating, then why in the nine circles of hell was he talking about dates?</p><p>Half-seriously, she considered testing him for telepathy by screaming something in her head, but before she could, his voice cut back in:</p><p>"-she'd appreciate the effort, I think. Even if it's not, like, an <em>actual </em>date. Besides, you two are friends, right? So you can just... I don't know, treat it as a fun night out. Something you'd both enj-"</p><p>"Teen."</p><p>He froze. His mouth snapped shut with the audible finality of a mousetrap.</p><p>"Out."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am!" He bolted so fast he nearly took the door with him.</p><p>When silence settled again, Agatha exhaled through her nose, slow and sharp, before opening her laptop once more. Her hand brushed against a scrap of paper on the desk, and she glanced down to see a crumpled sticky note. Two words glared up at her in bold, black letters: <em>Date ideas</em>.</p><p>Her mouth thinned. Well, at least he wasn't a psychic. It was Agatha's own carelessness that prompted him.</p><p>And, goddamn it, his nervous babbling had actually been <em>useful</em>.</p><p>"I am not taking her to a food truck," she muttered, stabbing at the search bar with unnecessary force.</p><p>Her fingers flew across the keys, each tap feeling like a blow to her dignity.</p><p>
<em>Simple first date ideas.</em>
</p><p>The first result loaded with a nauseatingly cheerful banner: <em>Top 50 Romantic Things to Do With Your Partner!</em></p><p>Agatha skimmed the list, feeling her headache worsen.</p><p>
<em>Take a long walk at sunset.</em>
</p><p>She scowled. "Walking. Truly fucking groundbreaking."</p><p>
<em>Attend a painting class.</em>
</p><p>Agatha shut her eyes, picturing herself in front of an easel. She didn't know if Rio had any artistic abilities, but <em>she</em> sure didn't, and she wasn't about to risk watching Rio create a masterpiece while she produced something that looked like a toddler's fever dream. "Absolutely not."</p><p>She scrolled faster.</p><p><em>Arcade night</em>.</p><p>"Nothing screams romance like the most overstimulating place on the planet."</p><p>Her lips curled as another suggestion popped up. <em>Make an appointment with a fortune teller.</em></p><p>"Right. So someone <em>else</em> can say that I'm a disaster. Pass."</p><p>The search engine helpfully refreshed the sidebar with even more options: <em>Top First Dates in the City!</em></p><p>Agatha groaned, rubbing at her temples. She was not a woman easily defeated, but the sheer banality of human courtship rituals was testing her patience. Pillow forts. Arcades. Walks in the park. It all sounded less like seduction and more like babysitting.</p><p>And yet, underneath the irritation, there was the smallest tug of something softer. If she stripped away the cloying presentation and the ridiculous suggestions, the point of all this was obvious: finding something that made Rio smile.</p><p>The problem was that Agatha didn't want just <em>any </em>smile. She wanted the kind that said she'd done it right.</p><p>She shut the laptop with a sharp snap, ignoring the unanswered emails sitting in her mailbox. "Fine. If the internet wants to be useless, I'll figure it out myself."</p><p>Her eyes landed on the crumpled sticky note by her mouse, the one she'd written for herself in the morning, hoping it would unlock some romantic vault at the back of her mind.</p><p>
<em>Date ideas.</em>
</p><p>The words stared back at her, smug in their simplicity. She smoothed the paper flat with the edge of her nail, lips twitching in annoyance. Those words were <em>the only words</em> written on the note. She'd given up on adding anything else after staring at the yellow square for thirty minutes without coming up with a single passable idea. Then she'd turned to the internet, hoping for a revelation but ending up with a headache and a permanent scowl.</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, glaring at the ceiling like she was blaming the universe itself for her lack of inspiration.</p><p>It shouldn't be that hard.</p><p>The date wasn't for some random stranger she'd met on a dating app, where the only information she had was from exchanging texts and a flimsy profile description. No, this was for someone she'd lived with for five months. Slept under the same roof. Shared morning coffee with. Argued about the morally correct way to stack the dishwasher.</p><p>Someone she'd been married to for the same amount of time.</p><p>And Agatha liked to think that - real or fake - their time together had let her get to know Rio.</p><p>She knew the way Rio hummed under her breath when she was concentrating, the exact spot in her cheek where she rested her tongue whenever she was being playful, and the infuriating habit of talking about her menagerie of plants as if they were full-fledged housemates rather than blobs of green slowly overtaking the house. She knew the curve of her handwriting from the papers occasionally scattered across the coffee table, the cadence of her laugh when she actually found something funny, and the quiet determination in her voice when she talked about her research.</p><p>She knew Rio was clever, stubborn, and perpetually ten minutes early to everything. She knew she liked her coffee sweet, her soccer matches loud, and her kitchen spotless.</p><p>So why the hell was it so hard to figure out where to take her on a stupid date?</p><p>Agatha's lips pursed, fingers drumming against the desk. Because this wasn't just 'a stupid date'. This was their first. Their first, after five months of pretending. Which meant it had to be good. No, better than good. It had to be <em>memorable.</em></p><p>The kind of night that would stay with Rio for the rest of her life.</p><p>Which made it infinitely more complicated.</p><p>She pinched the bridge of her nose, sighing through her teeth. "Christ, Harkness. You've cross-examined CEOs and dismantled entire corporations. You can plan a fucking dinner."</p><p>But that was the problem, wasn't it? Dinner was too easy. Dinner was what anyone could do, what they had already done under the guise of the fake marriage. And Rio deserved better than that. She deserved more than just <em>anyone</em>.</p><p>Agatha sat forward again, hands hovering over the discarded laptop.</p><p>Rio also deserved creativity - not an idea stolen from a saccharine website written by a lonely idiot with unresolved issues.</p><p>If Agatha was doing this, she was doing it properly. No guides, no lists, and no cheating. Something original. Something worthy of a beginning.</p><hr/><p>Two evenings later, Agatha stood in front of the mirror, scrutinizing her reflection with laser focus. A white silk shirt, crisp and clean. High-waisted trousers in her signature shade of purple, tailored sharp enough to slice, and a midnight-blue coat that fit like a sleek glove.</p><p>It was a deliberate ensemble, chosen with enough care to make her embarrassed whenever she thought about it too hard. Every line was designed to say <em>elegance</em>, every color meant to say <em>control</em>.</p><p>And yet, she was vibrating out of her skin.</p><p>Her fingers kept smoothing over the front of her shirt, checking buttons that didn't need checking. The collar felt too stiff, then too loose. The trousers, perfect minutes ago, suddenly seemed one crease away from disaster. She reached for her rings twice, slipped them on, then off, then on again, as if the metal itself couldn't decide if it belonged.</p><p>The woman staring back at her from the mirror looked poised, dangerous, untouchable. But Agatha's mouth had gone dry, and she was fairly certain everybody in the house could hear her thundering heart.</p><p>This wasn't like Alice's party, when her nerves had been mostly about appearances<em>.</em> This was worse. This was about <em>Rio.</em></p><p>And she wanted - no, she <em>needed</em> - Rio to have a perfect evening. A perfect date.</p><p>Agatha forced a long breath through her nose, adjusted the coat again, and glared at her reflection, "Get a grip, woman."</p><p>Her hands still trembled as she reached for her bag, but she pointedly ignored them, descending the stairs in what she hoped were confident strides.</p><p>The sounds drifting from the kitchen made her exhale again - this time in exasperation - and for a fleeting second, she considered leaving without another word. But she squared her shoulders and stepped in.</p><p>The smell of popcorn hit her first, buttery and warm, followed by the uneven staccato of kernels bursting in the microwave. Nicky's voice carried over it all, animated and breathless, recounting every riveting detail of creating the row of raised beds in their garden.</p><p>"-and Rio let me hold the drill! Not use it, though. But she said I totally can when I'm older!"</p><p>Sharon, perched like she belonged in Agatha's kitchen, offered the boy one of her saccharine smiles as she finished arranging bowls of pretzels and grapes. "You have to be strong just to hold it. I'm sure you'll be a perfect little handyman when the time comes."</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, the sound sharp enough to slice through the conversation. Sharon looked up first, beaming as though Agatha had just made her evening by existing.</p><p>"There you are," Sharon said warmly. "He's been talking my ear off about the garden. You've got quite the little helper on your hands."</p><p>"Mm." Agatha's eyes flicked to her son, busy stealing grapes from under his babysitter's hand, then back to the woman, one brow raised. "A helper who's supposed to be in bed by nine, not on a sugar high."</p><p>"Oh, we'll handle that." Sharon waved a dismissive hand, completely undeterred by the barb. "Don't you worry about a thing - we've got snacks, movies, and a whole night planned."</p><p>"Yes," Agatha said dryly, "a regular gala."</p><p>Nicky grinned at her, oblivious, and switched to showing handfuls of pretzels into his mouth.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sharon leaned one hip against the counter, studying Agatha with far too much interest. "Heading out, then?"</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes. "Yes."</p><p>"Without Rio?"</p><p>Honestly, Agatha knew the woman's life was boring beyond measure, but it didn't justify prying into hers.</p><p>"Rio's working," Nicky piped up around a mouthful of crushed pretzels, oblivious to the fact that the question wasn't aimed at him. "She does that <em>a lot</em>."</p><p>"Don't talk with your mouth full, Nicky," Agatha said automatically, though her tone lacked any sternness. A pang of guilt settled between her ribs, because yes, Rio was working, but working on her eyeliner at Alice's apartment while they pretended their evening was nothing unusual for Nicky's sake. Or maybe just their own.</p><p>"Sorry," he mumbled, swallowing before shuffling back to the microwave, nose almost pressed to the glass as the last kernels rattled inside.</p><p>Sharon's eyes stayed on Agatha, tracing the sharp lines of her outfit. "A night out with friends, then?" she asked with feigned nonchalance, the curiosity written all over her face.</p><p>Agatha's jaw ticked. A dozen scathing replies bloomed on her tongue, each more satisfying than the last, but she forced them down, mindful of the boy's eager ears. Instead, she gave a thin smile that looked more like a grimace. "Exactly."</p><p>Sharon's gaze didn't waver, a subtle frown appearing between her brows as if she didn't believe Agatha's words. "Well, it's good to see you enjoying yourself," she paused, eyes tracing the two undone buttons tastefully showing off Agatha's collarbones. "Even without the missus."</p><p>"Right," Agatha drawled, glancing at her watch. If she wanted to be on time, which was already pushing it, considering Rio's habit of showing up to everything early, she had to leave now. "I'll leave you to it." She gestured vaguely to the counter littered with snack bowls, adjusting her bag.</p><p>"Of course," Sharon said joyfully, the frown melting away as she ushered Nicky away from the microwave to get the popcorn out. "We'll be just fine."</p><p>Agatha didn't respond, bending down to brush a kiss against her son's hair. "Be good. I'll see you in the morning."</p><p>"Okay, Mama," he said, sending her a quick smile before grabbing the pretzels and disappearing into the house.</p><p>Straightening, Agatha gave Sharon a clipped nod that resembled an involuntary jerk and turned on her heel, heading for the garage. Her pulse quickened with each step for reasons completely unrelated to Sharon's aggravating personality, her heart tapping out an elaborate melody against her ribs.</p><p>Telling herself that it was just a date hadn't worked before, and it wasn't working now either, the word <em>date</em> making her fingers tighten around the steering wheel as she led the car out of the garage.</p><p>There was nothing <em>just</em> about the evening.</p><p>She'd spent years honing herself into sharp edges and colder steel, not someone who wasted time on candlelight and roses. Romance belonged to other people - people who scribbled sonnets into margins and thought fireworks were worth the neck pain. Not her.</p><p>Except now it <em>was</em> her.</p><p>Agatha pressed harder on the gas, making the car leap forward before she eased her foot back. Her knuckles whitened on the wheel. She'd refused the internet's moronic advice because Rio deserved something original, but now she hoped she had an excuse to fall back on.</p><p>Because what if Rio didn't like her idea? If it were lifted from a Buzzfeed reject list, Agatha could laugh and brush it off as someone else's mistake, but there was no third party she could shift the blame to. No, if Rio politely sat through the evening and then decided it wasn't enough, the failure would be Agatha's to bear.</p><p>And five months of pretending, of <em>wanting</em>, had been hard enough. To risk losing her now, before they'd even truly begun-</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, shaking her head as if she could physically force the thoughts out. Pathetic. Rio wasn't going to leave her over one night. She'd already said yes - already admitted she would've agreed to something real without a date at all. The spiral was unwarranted. <em>Entirely</em> unwarranted.</p><p>And yet, somewhere between backing out of the garage and pulling onto the main road, Agatha had regressed into something humilitatingly close to a nervous teenager, bracing for her first date with someone entirely out of her league.</p><p>Her grip tightened on the steering wheel until the leather creaked. This wasn't just fear of rejection. She could've managed something as pedestrian, clean.</p><p>No, this was worse. This was the gnawing, twisting knowledge that tonight wasn't about winning Rio over. It was about proving she deserved her. Proving she could be more than the bare minimum, more than takeout dinners at the kitchen counter, more than polite smiles at parties, more than a marriage contract scribbled in black ink.</p><p>Rio deserved better than <em>ordinary</em>. Better than someone who defaulted to the safe options of a candlelit dinner in an upscale restaurant. Better than Agatha, perhaps, but that wasn't a thought she was willing to entertain just now.</p><p>So the date had to matter. It had to say: <em>I see you. I know you. I want to give you something no one else has thought to give.</em></p><p>The realization pressed against her chest until it felt like her ribs might splinter, every beat of her heart thudding against the demand she'd placed on herself. She couldn't fail. Not with this. Not with Rio.</p><p>Agatha blew out another breath, this one sharp enough to fog the windshield for a beat. <em>Ridiculous</em>, she thought. <em>It's a date, not the apocalypse. You're not storming Normandy, you're picking up your wife - your fake wife, your maybe-something-more-wife - for dinner. Normal people manage this every day without nervous breakdowns.</em></p><p>Her jaw clenched. "Normal people," she muttered aloud, as if the phrase were a foreign concept. Normal people didn't spend their lives avoiding attachment. They didn't keep their emotions in locked vaults just to ensure none slipped out when it wasn't convenient. And, most importantly, normal people hadn't somehow stumbled into marrying Rio while trying to prove a point.</p><p>If she weren't so consumed by her thoughts, she'd spare a moment to blame Jen for her predicament. If the woman hadn't dragged her to that damned bar only to leave her alone, chances were she wouldn't ever <em>meet </em>Rio, let alone marry her.</p><p>Her fingers drummed a restless pattern against the wheel, betraying the agitation she pretended she didn't feel.</p><p>"Pathetic," she repeated, aloud this time. "Five months of living under the same roof, and you're nervous about whether she'll like an evening you arranged without the internet holding your hand. She already likes you, you idiot. She <em>said</em> so just a few days ago."</p><p>The memory nearly softened her - Rio's hand gripping hers, the warmth of her eyes in the living room's steady light, the conviction in her voice - but the spiral yanked her right back under. Because what if tonight ruined that? What if Agatha's carefully constructed attempt at romance only proved that she wasn't capable of it?</p><p>And Rio had been right. They <em>did</em> need this - something that marked a beginning, not just a continuation of the life they'd already cobbled together. The past few days had shown that all too clearly as they slipped into the domestic ease, wrapping it around themselves like an old, familiar blanket. If not for the fleeting touches shared when Nicky wasn't looking and the soft glances exchanged in moments too brief to be called intimate, Agatha would've thought she'd imagined the entire conversation with Rio.</p><p>It wasn't enough. Not for Rio, not for them. Without a true beginning, the real part of their relationship would sink into the weight of the fabricated one, subsumed by school projects, grocery lists, and the countless small habits they'd built under false pretenses. And Agatha couldn't stand the thought of their real connection being nothing more than a pretty patch sewn onto the fabric of a lie.</p><p>If this was going to last, it had to be real. And <em>real</em> started tonight.</p><p>Her pulse quickened as she turned onto Alice's street, headlights washing over the row of identical apartment buildings in a washed-out shade of gray. The nerves, already stretched thin, drew tighter with each passing second, until her chest felt like a snare drum struck too hard.</p><p>The car pulled up to the curb, and Agatha cut the engine, regretting it almost immediately as the silence surrounded her. Her fingers lingered on the steering wheel, knuckles pale against the leather. A part of her - the cowardly, self-preserving part - whispered that she could still drive away. Cancel with a quick text, pretend she'd been called into work, bury the whole idea deep in her chest until she had the necessary courage.</p><p>But then Rio would know. She'd <em>see</em> it the same way she could see Agatha's every other defense mechanism the second it kicked in. And then she'd demand answers, or worse, look at Agatha with that patient warmth in her eyes as she said she understood, and that she didn't need the date.</p><p>And that would mean failure - no, <em>capitulation</em>. It would be like waving the white flag before the battle even started.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, inhaling deeply to steady the quake inside her chest. She wasn't a coward. She didn't <em>give up</em>. If she could make a grown man cry in court, she could take her wife out on a date.</p><p>It was just Rio, for God's sake.</p><p>Just a date. With Rio.</p><p>A date she'd planned <em>specifically </em>for Rio.</p><p>Jesus, maybe she should've done the fort blanket idea. That way, she could've smothered herself with a pillow at any given time.</p><p>Or the walk in the park. It would've given her a chance to run into the woods and never return.</p><p>Or-</p><p>A knock on the window made her jump, an undignified yelp tumbling out of her lips. She heard Rio's chuckle fill the silence, followed by the thud of the car doors closing as the woman slipped into the passenger seat, her perfume immediately enveloping Agatha in a familiar embrace.</p><p>"Scared of me now? That's a first," Rio teased, buckling her seatbelt with the kind of casual ease that made Agatha want to throttle her and kiss her at the same time.</p><p>"Don't flatter yourself," Agatha snapped, though her voice climbed an octave too high, betraying her. She cleared her throat, adjusting her grip on the wheel. "You snuck up on an unarmed woman sitting alone in a car. <em>Startled</em> is more accurate."</p><p>"Right," Rio mused, tilting her head in Agatha's peripheral vision. "Startled. You should see your face."</p><p>Agatha finally tore her eyes from the windshield, glaring at her. "If you want this date to begin with you walking home, keep talking."</p><p>That earned her another laugh, low and warm, the kind that sank under her skin before she could fortify herself against it. And just like that, the nerves that had been choking her loosened - only to reassemble as something far more dangerous. Hope.</p><p>She started the engine again, shoving the car into gear. Her internal spiral had ruined the first point of her elaborate plan of wooing the woman - opening the door for her - and Rio's insistence on getting ready at two different places had robbed her of gifting her flowers since they would've ended up at Alice's place.</p><p>Two strikes, and they hadn't even arrived at their destination. Fantastic.</p><p>"So..." Rio said after the silence stretched for several blocks, her eyes never leaving Agatha. She could feel the gaze like a firm touch on the shoulder. "Am I allowed to know where we're going?"</p><p>Agatha's fingers tightened on the wheel. "Patience is a virtue."</p><p>"Eh, I've never been particularly virtuous," Rio shrugged, sinking further into her seat. "Is this payback for our last fake date?"</p><p>"No. That would be childish," Agatha said, leading the car into another unnecessary turn. She'd purposefully opted for the longer, roundabout way to their destination, hoping Rio wouldn't guess where they were headed until the last minute. "You specifically told me I was to plan everything. This is merely a part of that plan."</p><p>Rio let out a theatrical huff, crossing her arms over her chest. "You're mean."</p><p>Agatha couldn't help the slight curve of her lips at the audible pout in the woman's voice. "I thought you liked me mean," she said, the words slipping out smoother than she'd intended.</p><p>Rio's eyes sparkled in the glow of the passing streetlights. "Oh, I do," she said, her tone low, almost purring. "I'd just like to see if it's all bark and no bite."</p><p>Agatha's throat went dry. She forced herself to keep her eyes on the road, though every nerve in her body was aware of Rio sitting barely inches away. "Careful, darling. You might not handle the bite."</p><p>"Try me."</p><p>The challenge hummed between them, filling the charged silence that settled, until Rio shifted in her seat. Her hand stretched casually, sliding along the console until her fingers brushed against Agatha's - light enough to be an accident, but too lingering to be anything but deliberate.</p><p>Agatha's left hand tightened on the wheel, the contact searing through her skin and making her pulse stumble dangerously. Then Rio hummed, smug and satisfied, as if she could hear the stutter of her breath, and Agatha clenched her jaw.</p><p>Without looking away from the road ahead, she seized Rio's palm in her own, interlacing their fingers with more grace than she'd expect from herself.</p><p>"At least fucking commit to it," she grumbled, relishing the surprised exhale that escaped Rio's lungs.</p><p>The woman recovered quickly, of course she did, her fingers curling back with an ease that made the contact seem inevitable. "There she is," she muttered, her voice low but clearly amused.</p><p>Agatha's grip faltered for a fraction of a second, but she didn't let go. Couldn't. She kept her eyes forward, jaw tight, pretending the simple act of holding hands wasn't enough to unravel her one thread at a time.</p><p>The car filled with the quiet rhythm of the road beneath them, the occasional passing headlights casting shadows across Rio's face. And every few seconds, Rio's thumb traced an idle stroke over the back of Agatha's hand, lazy, unhurried, and entirely devastating.</p><p>"Well," Rio said softly, the smirk audible in her voice, "maybe you're not so mean after all."</p><p>Agatha flexed her grip, letting her nails press into Rio's palm just enough to earn a quick intake of breath. "You're walking on thin ice."</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the warning didn't work. Rio merely tilted her head, eyes gleaming. "I'm kinda curious what happens when it cracks," she muttered, thumb still moving, stroking.</p><p>Agatha kept her eyes on the road, ignoring her hammering heart. She was supposed to be the one in control here, asserting dominance the same way Rio had on their last outing. Instead, she found herself choking on her own composure while Rio looked perfectly content, fingers laced with hers like it was a part of her plan all along.</p><p>"Curiosity killed the cat," Agatha said, fighting the heat climbing the back of her neck. "Also, the offer of walking home still stands. It's in your best interest to behave."</p><p>"Mm," Rio hummed, clearly pleased, "and what if I don't?"</p><p>The question sent a spark of heat down Agatha's spine, lighting her skin from the inside out. Her composure frayed with every deliberate sweep of Rio's thumb, every teasing lilt in her voice. She could feel her grip slipping - on Rio's hand, on the wheel, on her own damn equilibrium.</p><p>It was unbearable, the way Rio made it seem so effortless. Like she'd been born knowing how to dismantle Agatha piece by piece with nothing but a lazy drag of her thumb and a seemingly innocent question.</p><p>Before she could think it through, Agatha tore her hand free and clamped it onto the wheel, the motion sharp, almost defensive. The absence of contact left her palm tingling, aching in a way that only worsened her irritation, and she mentally slapped herself on the forehead.</p><p>Here they were, on the way to their first real date, with Agatha taking the lead to make herself seem worthy of Rio's affection, and she'd just chickened out of holding hands.</p><p><em>Great going, Harkness</em>, she thought grimly, chancing a quick look to the side.</p><p>Rio didn't seem bothered by the rejection. She simply reclined in her seat, turning her face toward the window with her lips pulled into a small smile. "Touchy," she murmured affectionately, her voice slightly teasing.</p><p>"I'm driving," Agatha pointed out stiffly. "Forgive me if keeping us alive takes precedence."</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw Rio's smirk deepen, her lips parting to undoubtedly poke at Agatha's defenses even further, before her expression softened as if she decided against it. "I'm not sure if simply keeping both your hands on the wheel will help. Maybe you should try not driving like your last name's Toretto."</p><p>Agatha almost sighed in relief at the topic change, eager to focus on something other than the heat burning low in her stomach and the taste of failure rising in her throat. "Better than driving like a grandmother on Sunday."</p><p>Rio gasped, her head whipping around to look at Agatha again. "Excuse me? Are you really shaming me for adhering to the speed limit?"</p><p>"There's the speed limit and then there's your driving," Agatha snorted. "I once saw a toddler on a balance bike move faster than you. It's a wonder you're never late to anything."</p><p>Rio huffed again, her eyes narrowing in mock offense. "It's called time management."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow without looking away from the road. "It's called driving like you're ninety."</p><p>Rio let out a scandalized laugh, clutching at her chest as if she'd been stabbed. "<em>Ninety?</em> Take that back."</p><p>"Why? The comparison's generous," Agatha smirked faintly, flicking the turn signal with pointed precision. "At least the elderly have an excuse. You're just afraid of bending the rules."</p><p>"<em>Breaking the law</em>, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha waved her hand dismissively before returning it to the wheel. "Same thing."</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but her lips curled in a small, fond smile. "Shouldn't you at least <em>pretend</em> to care about following the law? Considering what you do for a living."</p><p>"Please," Agatha scoffed. "The law is a tool, not a religion. If I worshipped it, I'd never win a case."</p><p>"That's terrifying," Rio deadpanned, though her eyes sparkled. "Remind me never to get on your bad side."</p><p>"You already are," Agatha muttered, though it came out far too soft, unveiling the blatant lie.</p><p>Rio turned her head toward her, studying the rigid line of her jaw. A slow grin spread across her face. "And yet, here I am. Still alive. Still on a date with you."</p><p>Agatha's grip on the wheel tightened again. "Keep trying me, and that might change."</p><p>"It won't," Rio said confidently, leaning back with a smug tilt of her chin. "You like me too much. And I like seeing you squirm."</p><p>Agatha's pulse jumped, but she forced a dry laugh. "Then tonight will be the highlight of your year."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, a teasing retort already poised on her tongue, but before she could deliver it, the car slowed. The streetlamps thinned, giving way to darker stretches of the road lined with chain-link fences and hulking silhouettes of trees.</p><p>Agatha turned onto a narrower street, the houses giving way to a patch of shadowed green. She'd chosen the longer route to keep Rio guessing, but now there was no further delay in the reveal.</p><p>"Okay," Rio said, peering out the windshield as her face lit up with recognition. "That's... definitely not a restaurant."</p><p>"Sharp observation," Agatha replied tightly. She eased the car into a small gravel turnout near the base of a hill. A modest wrought-iron gate stood a few yards away, tucked between brick pillars. Ivy crept along the sides, and beyond it, a faint golden glow traced a path up the slope.</p><p>Rio's realization faltered into confusion as the engine cut off, punctuating the end of their drive. "Um, you know this place closes at dusk, right?"</p><p>"Does it?" Agatha asked as casually as she could with her heart hammering in her throat, already unbuckling her seatbelt. She slipped out of the driver's seat with her usual precision and came around to Rio's side. With a practiced flourish, she opened the passenger door and offered her hand.</p><p>Rio took it, stepping down onto the uneven gravel, still visibly bewildered. "I know you find my rule-abiding nature funny, but I could actually get <em>expelled</em> for breaking in here."</p><p>"Dramatic, aren't we?" Agatha chuckled, threading her fingers through Rio's as she drew her toward the gate. The crunch of gravel beneath their feet filled the temporary silence, the iron gate looming larger with every step. Agatha's grip around Rio's hand tightened, as if holding on could stop the knot growing in her stomach.</p><p>This was stupid. She suspected Rio had been here before - she probably knew every path, every bloom, every corner of this place like the back of her hand. What if it felt trite? Predictable? Agatha had promised herself this wouldn't be dinner-at-a-restaurant levels of unoriginal, and here she was, leading Rio to the most obvious plant-related place in the city, managed by the university that Rio attended.</p><p>She forced a smirk onto her lips anyway. "You run almost every day. I'm sure you could escape any guard if it came to that."</p><p>Rio didn't laugh. She stopped short a few paces from the gate, pulling back gently against Agatha's tug. "Agatha, I'm serious. They don't let people in after dark. I've been here plenty of times - the gates are always locked."</p><p>The words landed like a fist to her sternum. <em>Plenty of times.</em> Right. She schooled her features into nonchalance even as her pulse roared in her ears. "Then I guess tonight's an exception."</p><p>Rio's brows knit, suspicion flickering into her expression. "What do you mean-"</p><p>The subtle creak of the gate cut her off as Agatha used her free hand to push it open just enough to showcase her point.</p><p>Rio's voice faltered. "Wait... how did you-"</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin, fighting to keep her composure, though her stomach had twisted itself into knots so tight she half-expected to retch. "I have my ways."</p><p>Rio glanced between the gate and the woman holding her hand. "<em>Legal</em> ways?"</p><p>"No, I blackmailed the board to allow this," Agatha deadpanned. The joke dropped like a stone between them, and she immediately cursed herself. <em>First date. Charm. Romance. Not being a sarcastic asshole.</em></p><p>Her grip on Rio's hand tightened, and she forced her tone to soften. "Darling, I promise you everything about tonight is above board. No rules bent. No laws broken. And-" her throat bobbed, the words catching before she pushed them out, "-nobody knows who I'm bringing here."</p><p>Realizing that somebody on staff could've recognized Rio's name, Agatha had avoided mentioning it altogether. She'd also kept her own identity as vague as possible, painting herself as just another wealthy donor arranging something private. It had been deliberate, necessary. The idea of some bored administrator gossiping about their age gap, about Rio, about her - Agatha's chest tightened. No. She wouldn't make Rio's life harder than it already was.</p><p>But Rio hadn't moved. Her gaze lingered on Agatha's face, sharp and searching, as though she were trying to peel back layers of composure to see what lurked underneath. Then it flicked again, reaching past the gate and resting on the jars glowing faintly beyond the iron bars. "This path shouldn't be lit," she murmured almost to herself.</p><p>Agatha forced her shoulders to stay loose, refusing to read into Rio's measured tone. "I didn't want us to stumble around in the dark. Figured this would be more... date-worthy than blindly tripping over roots."</p><p>Rio looked at her again, expression unreadable. "You did this?"</p><p>"I... arranged for it," Agatha said slowly, hanging onto Rio's hand like a lifeline. The nausea crept up her throat, and she swallowed thickly to push it down.</p><p>"Arranged," Rio repeated slowly. "So you just... called up Harvard and asked for lights?"</p><p>"Among other things, yes."</p><p>Rio's eyebrow twitched. "I imagine they didn't do it for free."</p><p>"There was a donation involved," Agatha admitted vaguely.</p><p>Rio's silence pressed heavily against her ribs, and the longer she held that searching gaze, the more Agatha's throat closed. Maybe she'd done too much. Maybe the lights, the donation, the secrecy - it all screamed <em>try-hard</em> instead of thoughtful. Maybe Rio would see it as some hollow performance instead of what it really was: Agatha's fumbling, desperate attempt to prove she could do romance.</p><p>Or worse, in her determination to mix familiarity with romance, she'd come up with a bland, unoriginal idea and taken Rio to a place she probably knew better than any other spot in the city.</p><p>Her tongue darted over her lips before she heard herself say, too quickly, "We don't have to stay. If you'd rather, we can go somewhere else. A restaurant, a bar, even just a regular public park if that's-" She cut herself off, heat crawling up her neck. God, she sounded like a child begging for extra credit. "I just... wanted tonight to feel different."</p><p>She forced a shrug, aiming for nonchalance and landing squarely in desperation. "But if this is too much, or... predictable, we can leave right now. No questions asked."</p><p>The words hung in the cool night air, fraying at the edges, but Rio didn't let them fester. She squeezed Agatha's hand, steady and grounding, before speaking.</p><p>"You really think this is predictable?" Her tone was gentle, but laced with disbelief. "Agatha, yes, I've been here a dozen times - but never like this. Not after dark, not with the paths lit up like stars, and definitely not with a gorgeous woman who went so far as to make a donation just to give us privacy and turn it into something out of a fairytale."</p><p>Her lips curved teasingly, her gaze refusing to let Agatha look away. "It <em>is</em> slightly over the top. But that's you, isn't it? You don't do things halfway. I guess that's the one predictable thing about..." Her eyes slid back toward the lantern-lit path beyond the gate, shimmering with restrained awe. "...this."</p><p>Agatha clung to that note of wonder like a drowning woman to driftwood, letting it steady her wobbling composure. "So... no to the restaurant?" she managed, voice thinner than she liked.</p><p>Rio's chuckle rumbled low, warm in the night air, and she shook her head. "No. Absolutely not. I'm too curious to see what else you've planned." Then her eyes returned to Agatha, catching the light in a way that made her look carved out of something more eternal. "But you should know-" her voice softened, sinking under Agatha's skin like velvet. "-you don't need gravity-defying gestures to keep me interested. I would've been content with anything... as long as it was with you."</p><p>The tight knot in Agatha's stomach loosened at the declaration. "I wanted to do something special. For you. For us. Something worthy of a beginning."</p><p>The admission slipped out without her permission - a rushed cluster of words dipped in the kind of vulnerability that immediately made her instincts scream to take them back. But she didn't. She swallowed the sarcastic remark brewing on her tongue and forced herself not to retreat. If there was ever a night to be honest, it was this one.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching her with that infuriating, unflinching attentiveness that always made Agatha feel as if she were standing on trial, stripped of every defense. But instead of judgment, there was only warmth in her eyes, the kind that pressed gently against the cracks in Agatha's armor and painlessly widened them.</p><p>"A beginning," she echoed quietly, not quite tasting the word but testing its weight.</p><p>Agatha nodded, tongue darting over her lips. "The past few days... they've been good. <em>Familiar.</em> But, like you said, we can't slip back into comfort like nothing's changed. Because things <em>have</em> changed, and we shouldn't surrender them to routine. Not if we want this to work." She let out a faint, humorless laugh. "And I <em>do</em> want it to work. Even though I'm not exactly a natural at this."</p><p>Rio's eyes softened even as her grip on Agatha's hand tightened. "Relationships? Or romance?"</p><p>Agatha shrugged helplessly. "Both? Either? You deserve someone who can do it right. Who can meet you where you are without fumbling like a schoolgirl. And I-" Her voice faltered, the admission catching in her chest before she forced it out. "I don't know if I'm that person. But I want to try."</p><p>For a beat, silence stretched between them, fragile and loaded. The night air seemed to press closer, the lantern light shimmering on Rio's cheekbones, outlining the curve of her smile as it returned - small, but achingly sincere.</p><p>"You know," Rio said softly, taking a step forward to catch Agatha's darting eyes, "for someone who claims to be terrible at romance, you're doing a pretty damn good job right now."</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, the sound falling somewhere between a laugh and a sigh as the tension bled out of her chest. Still, she muttered, almost petulantly, "We haven't even entered yet. There's still room for disappointment."</p><p>Rio's thumb traced another slow arc over her skin, deliberate and grounding. "You strong-armed Harvard into lighting up their crown jewel for the night," she said, amusement woven into her tone. "You could murder me at the end of this path, and I still wouldn't be disappointed."</p><p>Agatha's lips twitched in a half smile. "Your survival instincts are a cry for help."</p><p>"There are worse ways to go than being killed by a beautiful woman on an evening stroll through a park," Rio argued with a shrug. "At least I'd die happy."</p><p>Agatha blinked at the word, feeling giddiness spread across her body at the mere thought that she was the reason behind Rio's happiness, even if it was in a fake scenario where she murdered her on their first date.</p><p>"Don't tempt me," her voice came out too soft to sound threatening.</p><p>Rio's answering grin was a contradiction of sharp edges and warm corners. "We've already established you like me too much to kill me."</p><p>Agatha scoffed, tugging her hand forward so Rio would finally step through the gate. "Debatable."</p><p>"Mm. You can debate it all you want." Rio's tone was light, but her gaze lingered on Agatha as though she was committing the moment to memory. "I already have my answer."</p><p>Agatha ignored the heat spreading across her chest, focusing on the path ahead. The jars glowed brighter now that they were fully inside, lining the walkway in soft gold and cool white. Branches arched above like a canopy, the leaves catching and refracting the light until it looked like stars had settled in the trees.</p><p>Rio's steps slowed, the teasing curl of her mouth fading into something quieter. "It's... beautiful."</p><p>The words washed over Agatha like a balm, steadying her nerves just long enough to allow a deep breath. She let herself watch Rio take it in - the way her expression softened, how the glow kissed her features and made her look almost unreal.</p><p><em>Worth it</em>, Agatha thought with sudden clarity. Every frantic hour of planning, every second of spiraling, every sharp twist of fear in her chest - worth it, if it meant she could watch Rio like this.</p><p>"It really is," she muttered, eyes tracing the slope of Rio's jaw and the shadows her lashes carved high on her cheekbones.</p><p>The sight almost made her furious. Furious with herself for how long she'd let fear rule her, for every day she'd wasted behind sharp words and cold distance. Months she could've spent here, like this, close enough to trace the lines of Rio's face with her fingertips, close enough to feel the easy warmth that radiated from her like sunlight breaking through storm clouds.</p><p>Instead, she'd been a coward. Building walls out of sarcasm and discipline as if Rio couldn't see straight through them anyway.</p><p>And now here she was, undone by a look, by the hush of the night, by the fact that after everything, Rio was still here. Still holding her hand. Still choosing her.</p><p>The swell pressed hard against her chest, almost unbearable in its tenderness.</p><p>She tore her eyes away, jaw tightening as though sheer will could dam the flood before it broke through and drowned her. "Come on," she said, voice low but roughened at the edges. "There's more to see."</p>

<p>The incline stretched before them, lanterns spaced along the path like breadcrumbs leading the way to some carefully orchestrated secret. Gravel crunched under their shoes, and the faint rustle of leaves overhead blended with the distant hum of the city.</p><p>Agatha kept her strides measured, even as her heart raced like she was sprinting. She'd walked this path three times in the past two days - the first two to see if the setting would work, and the third to ensure everything would be flawless - but somehow, the added presence made her feel like she was climbing Everest instead of a small hill.</p><p>Rio walked beside her easily, gaze flicking from lantern to lantern with a quiet smile tugging at her lips. Despite undoubtedly knowing the path, her eyes took in every detail like she was seeing it for the first time, taking in not only the added lights but also the way they bounced off the greenery, giving the garden a magical feel.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, forcing her voice to sound steady. "How many times have you been here before?"</p><p>"Too many to count," Rio admitted, glancing sideways at her. "But I've never seen it lit up like this. Since there are no artificial lights, it's always pitch black after dusk."</p><p>Agatha nearly tripped over her own feet. "So you've been here after dark before?" she asked, praying that their connected hands didn't offer enough contact for Rio to feel her thundering pulse.</p><p>Rio nodded, either not noticing Agatha's slight stumble or choosing to ignore it. "One of my professors recommended me for an internship, so I spent a few weeks practically living here," she smiled fondly, eyes still tracing the lit path. "It was a nice experience, but after all the hours I spent slaving away in this place, it's refreshing to see it in a different light. Literally."</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet hum, tilting her head toward the path as though the lights were her idea of a casual decoration rather than hours of planning and a generous donation. Inside, though, her chest tightened. Different light. Of course Rio had memories here. What if this reminded her too much of work? What if Agatha's carefully staged evening fell flat against the weight of Rio's lived experience?</p><p>She forced her muscles to relax as they reached the final bend. The skyline broke open before them, Boston glittering like spilled jewels in the distance, and the hilltop clearing revealed itself.</p><p>Lanterns pooled soft gold across the grass, marking a wide blanket spread with cushions and a low wooden table laden with food and wine. A thermos sat beside the bottle, steam faintly curling from its spout as if it were waiting for them. At the center of the table, a simple, tall vase filled with flowers gleamed in the lanternlight, offering a splash of bright red in the sea of beiges, browns, and greens.</p><p>The silence around them felt like calm before the storm.</p><p>Rio slowed to a stop, her gaze sweeping across the scene, then settling on Agatha. Her lips parted like she was about to speak, but no words came, and that nearly killed Agatha more than anything she could have said.</p><p>She let go of the hand in hers, afraid she would crush it with her nervous grip, and stuffed it into her coat pocket, throat dry. "It's... modest."</p><p>Rio blinked, then threw her head back and laughed loud enough for it to echo around the clearing. "Modest? This looks like a set for a Vogue shoot." Her eyes softened as they returned to the blanket, then to the skyline beyond. "It's incredible."</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks burn. "Well, I can't take <em>all</em> the credit. The staff wouldn't let me set it up myself - something about rules and fire hazards - so I had to instruct them," she swept her gaze over the scene. "I made a few adjustments before getting ready, but-"</p><p>"Wait," Rio held up her hand, stopping her. "You wanted to set everything up yourself?"</p><p>Agatha frowned at the surprise in the woman's voice. "Yes? I didn't want strangers putting their hands all over... this." She gestured vaguely to the lanterns, the blanket, the table - then, after a pause, she added more quietly, "It wouldn't have felt right if I hadn't at least touched it. Arranged it. Done it for you. The point wasn't to outsource everything, but that... it came from me."</p><p>The words hadn't even settled between them when Agatha felt heat claw up the back of her neck. There had to be something in the air for her defenses to be low enough for the truth to keep slipping out. It felt like a problem, especially when the truth made her sound weak and desperate. She braced herself for Rio's inevitable smirk, hands curling into fists in her pockets.</p><p>But Rio didn't smirk. She just stared at her, eyes wide and luminous in the glow. "Let me get this straight," she said slowly, her tone hovering somewhere between disbelief and wonder. "You, Agatha Harkness, who would rather delegate everything from coffee runs to committee meetings, were willing to spend hours setting up an elaborate scene straight from a fairytale. After a full day at the office. And you're actually upset because the staff didn't let you do it yourself. All because it's... for me."</p><p>Rio let the last two words hang in the air for a moment, the look in her eyes inquisitive enough for Agatha's pulse to quicken. Then, the corners of her mouth rose, the smile teasing but warm. "I'm starting to think the comment about romance was to throw me off."</p><p>"Yes, well," Agatha said smoothly, forcing her racing heart into submission. "Apparently, I have layers."</p><p>Rio laughed softly, shaking her head. "Don't I know it. I spent the past five months peeling them off one by one."</p><p>"I can <em>sense</em> the joke about onions and ogres you're about to make," Agatha grumbled, narrowing her eyes. "Don't."</p><p>Rio pouted, but the spark in her eyes betrayed her amusement. "It's not like I'd call you an ogre on the first date. Maybe... the fourth?"</p><p>Agatha sighed in exasperation, but the corner of her mouth tilted upward. Rio was already thinking about future dates. That had to be a good sign.</p><p>"Sit," she said, gesturing toward the low table where the lanternlight pooled gold across polished wood and crystal. "Before you mock me further or change your mind about comparing me to a green recluse with anger issues."</p><p>Rio arched a brow. "Is that an order?"</p><p>"It's a suggestion," Agatha corrected, slipping her hand lightly against the small of Rio's back to guide her toward the cushions. "The kind that doesn't leave room for negotiation."</p><p>Rio let out a soft hum, clearly entertained, but allowed herself to be steered. The cushions sank beneath her as she folded into them, the soft light painting highlights across her cheekbones. "Bossy," she murmured, lips curving as she looked up at Agatha. "Some things never change."</p><p>Agatha lowered herself onto the opposite cushion with careful grace, grateful to be doing something other than standing and squirming under Rio's gaze. "Practical," she corrected again, reaching for the bottle at the center of the table. Her fingers brushed the chilled glass, steady now that she had a task. "If you're going to be impressed, you should at least be comfortable while doing it."</p><p>Rio's brow arched, amusement flickering across her face, but her attention soon drifted to the table. The low wooden surface scattered with details meant to appear effortless, though Agatha had agonized over each one - the neat folds of linen napkins, silver utensils that caught and fractured the lights, plates crowned with covered dishes whose steam had barely begun to fade. A faint thread of rosemary and garlic lingered in the air, rich enough to make the clearing feel warmer than it was.</p><p>Agatha eased the cork from the bottle, the soft pop punctuating the hush of the garden. She poured into the waiting glasses, then slid one across the table toward Rio, who barely noticed, eyes trained on the vase standing proud between them.</p><p>"Is that..." she leaned forward to examine the flowers more thoroughly, her hand brushing against the petals hesitantly. "...<em>Flor de Maga</em>?"</p><p>Agatha fought back the urge to make a joke about how <em>Rio</em> was the plant-obsessed one between them. "It is," she said instead, eyes instinctively flicking to Rio's collarbone, where an identical flower was etched into her skin under the green sweater.</p><p>Rio's breath hitched, fingers lingering over the velvet-soft petals as though they might vanish if she pressed too hard. "How did you get these?"</p><p>Agatha swirled her own glass, focusing on the wine's dark hues to avoid looking directly at the woman. "Not easily," she admitted with a small shrug. "They don't exactly thrive in Boston, I suppose. But I thought..." she hesitated, words balancing on the edge of confession, "...you might appreciate something familiar."</p><p>When she finally dared to glance up, Rio was staring at her like she'd just pulled the moon down onto the table. The intensity of it made Agatha's pulse trip.</p><p>"I never told you what they were," Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, feigning nonchalance. "Google exists for a reason. I figured they had to be important to you if you chose to carry them on your body for the rest of your life, so I went from there."</p><p>There had also been an embarrassing amount of hours spent hunched over her laptop, typing things like '<em>red flowers with uneven petals, tropical?'</em> into her search bar until her eyes blurred. She'd take that particular humiliation to the grave.</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly, her hand drifting down to rest lightly against the tablecloth, fingers brushing near the vase in thought. "They mean more to me than that," she murmured. Her gaze softened on the flower, a faint smile tugging at her lips. "They're Puerto Rico's national bloom, sure. But they were also my ma's favorite. My dad would go out of his way to find them - anniversaries, birthdays, any excuse, really. He'd bring her bouquets that probably cost too much, and she'd scold him for it every single time."</p><p>Her voice caught, just barely, though her smile lingered. "But she lit up when he walked in with them. Like nothing else in the world mattered but those flowers in his hands."</p><p>For a moment, silence stretched, the kind that wasn't uncomfortable so much as fragile - like even the night itself was listening. Rio's finger traced absentmindedly along the rim of her glass before she shifted back, tugging at her loose collar to bare her shoulder. The lanternlight caught on the ink winding over her skin, vines curling into blooms.</p><p>"That's why I started with this one," she said quietly, fingers brushing over the crimson petals inked just beneath her collarbone. "When I turned eighteen, I walked into a shop and asked for a <em>Flor de Maga</em>. It wasn't planned, just... something I needed to do. A way to carry her - both of them - with me, even if it was only in ink."</p><p>Her hand moved again, pulling the sweater back into place. "And once I started, I didn't stop. Every flower I've added since is a memory of a person, a place, a moment I didn't want to forget. Now, it spreads from my shoulder, down across the upper arm, curling back here," her fingertips ghosted toward her shoulder blade, where the vines disappeared beneath the knit. "I like to think of it as a garden. Something alive that keeps growing with me."</p><p>She gave a small, self-depricating laugh. "It sounds stupid when I say it out loud. But I usually don't. Most people think it's just a decoration fitting for my line of studies. They don't care to ask for the stories."</p><p>Agatha leaned back slightly, her glass balanced in elegant fingers, though she didn't take a sip. "And if someone did ask?" she ventured, voice low, almost cautious. "Would you tell them the stories?"</p><p>Rio tilted her head, the warm light softening her watchful gaze. "Depends who was asking."</p><p>"Suppose it were me."</p><p>For a moment, Rio just watched her, then her smile grew, slow and deliberate. "Then yes. I'd tell you," she let the answer breathe before adding, almost mischievously, "Not tonight, though."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, part curious, part challenge. "Oh?"</p><p>"You'll have to see the whole garden first if you want to hear about it," Rio said, taking a slow sip of her wine before her smile softened, taking the edge off the tease. "Every flower has a story. You don't get the stories without seeing the flowers."</p><p>Something in Agatha's chest tightened, her smooth facade threatening to slip. She mirrored Rio's movements, lifting her glass to her lips. "Then I suppose I'll need to find an occasion to... see the rest."</p><p>Rio laughed lightly, not mocking but warm, the sound carrying easily into the quiet night. "That can be arranged."</p><p>The innuendo caused a flutter in Agatha's stomach. She reached for the serving spoon with what she hoped was casual precision, scooping the pasta - creamy with a healthy amount of shrimps just the way Rio liked it - onto Rio's plate before filling her own. "I'll hold you to it," she murmured, but her voice was a touch too careful, her hand lingering just a second too long near Rio's wrist.</p><p>For a while, the quiet between them was easy - only the clink of cutlery, the faint whistle of wind stirring leaves, the steady backdrop of the city beyond the hill. It was too easy, in fact. It made Agatha aware of how rare this was for them. Two people, a meal, the faint spark of something real but... normal. Unburdened.</p><p>Rio set her fork down, breaking the spell. "It's unreal," she murmured, eyes tracing the horizon before setting back on Agatha. "Being here after pretending for so long."</p><p>Agatha's chest tightened. She arched a brow, trying for levity. "You should consider an acting career. Your performance as my wife has been exceptional."</p><p>Rio laughed softly, shaking her head. "That's not what I mean. I mean... pretending I didn't <em>want </em>to be here. At some point, that became harder than acting like your dutiful wife."</p><p>Agatha's breath stalled, her fork halfway to her mouth. The words landed heavier than they should have, like a stone dropped into still water.</p><p>She managed a smirk - sharp, brittle. "Careful. Or you'll make me think I'm irresistible."</p><p>Rio's lips curved dangerously, but her gaze remained steady. "Maybe you are."</p><p>Agatha set her fork down, buying herself a moment. She'd spent months convincing herself she was imagining those cracks in Rio's performance - the softened looks, the lingering touches, the way her laughter sometimes came too easily to be feigned. She'd blamed it on Rio's friendly nature, on the proximity, on her own twisted wishes. But hearing it spoken aloud, she knew better. They hadn't been cracks at all, not really. They were the same fissures running through her.</p><p>Her eyes dropped to her left hand, to the ring catching faint light from the lanterns. She'd grown used to its weight on her finger, even grown a habit of toying with it whenever she grew anxious. But here, now, it was nothing but a symbol of pretense. Of obligations. Of everything this wasn't supposed to be.</p><p>"It <em>is</em> unreal," she said at last, her voice quiet but sure. "We've gotten so used to pretending that it's hard to believe we don't have to right now. Pretending to be married, pretending we don't want more than that..."</p><p>Her voice trailed off. The silence that followed was heavy, but not uncomfortable - more like the hush of something fragile taking shape.</p><p>Agatha turned the band around her finger, her thumb gliding over the polished gold. But the gesture that usually brought her peace felt different. Weighted.</p><p>Her breath caught as she slid the ring free. For months, it had been a fixture she refused to part with for the sake of the game Evanora had forced her to play. She'd learned to wear it like armor, like a mask that eventually became too familiar to notice. Yet setting it down now felt like stripping away a layer she no longer needed.</p><p>She stared at it for a long moment, then glanced back at Rio. "This," she said quietly, gesturing to the gold band, "was always for show. But this-" she tilted her chin toward Rio, toward the lanterns and the skyline and everything that had led them here, "-this is ours. <em>Just</em> ours. For once, not a performance."</p><p>Rio didn't speak right away. Her eyes lingered on the ring resting between them, then rose back to Agatha's face. There was no teasing in her expression now, no shield of wit. Only a quiet, raw certainty that made Agatha's pulse race.</p><p>Slowly, deliberately, Rio reached for her own band, twisting it once before sliding it off. The metal glinted in the light as she set it down beside Agatha's, the two bands lying parallel, silent witnesses to their unspoken shift.</p><p>"When I put this on in the courthouse, I told myself it didn't matter," Rio said slowly. "And it didn't, at first. People would look, assume, ask, and I'd shrug, telling them that I got married the same way I'd tell them about doing laundry. It wasn't real, so I didn't feel anything about it." She exhaled slowly, the corner of her lips rising. "But somewhere along the way, the lines started blurring, and I started feeling <em>everything</em>. People didn't ask anymore, and I was glad because I wouldn't know how to answer without facing the truth - the truth that pretending not to want you took precedence over every other part of the act."</p><p>Her gaze locked on Agatha's, steady and warm. "You're right. Tonight's ours, and we get to choose what's real."</p><p>Agatha felt warmth pool in her chest at the words, her hand shaking slightly as she raised her glass, holding it just above the table. "To choosing, then," she murmured.</p><p>Rio lifted hers in answer, the crystal catching golden light. "To choosing."</p><p>They clinked their glasses gently, the sound swallowed by the garden's hush, and for a moment neither of them moved. The rings gleamed side by side on the table, but they didn't spare them a second glance. Instead, as though in silent agreement, they both reached again for their forks.</p><p>Agatha speared a shrimp, suddenly all too aware of the mundane act of eating. She cleared her throat. "I hate Kestra with all my heart, but they do know how to make good pasta."</p><p>Rio raised a brow. "You had it delivered from there?"</p><p>"I figured you deserved a chance to try it after surrendering your plate in a power move," Agatha's mouth twitched. "A phenomenal power move, might I add."</p><p>Rio chuckled, putting another bite in her mouth and sighing in exaggerated approval. "It's amazing. Though I'm a little disappointed you didn't decide to cook."</p><p>Agatha shot her a look over the rim of her glass. At the beginning of the date, the comment would send her into another spiral, but right now, it only made her scoff. "And risk poisoning you on our first date? Not a chance."</p><p>"You're selling yourself short," Rio said. "That risotto you made when I first came to the house was great. Besides, you regularly cook for Nicky, and he's still alive."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, smiling into her wine. "He had the time to build up immunity."</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head. "This just feels like you're making excuses to deprive me of the privilege of tasting your cooking."</p><p>"Privilege?" Agatha's laugh was sharp, but her gaze softened as it settled on Rio. "It's more of a gamble. Besides, I'd rather our evenings together not end with me frantically Googling 'how to induce vomiting.'"</p><p>Rio nearly choked on her wine, laughing into the rim of her glass before setting it down. "God, you're ridiculous."</p><p>"And yet, somehow, you agreed to this date," Agatha said smoothly, though her voice betrayed her composure.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, smile growing wider. "I like ridiculous."</p><p>Agatha stilled, fork hovering over her plate. Something in Rio's voice, the ease with which she said it, left her a little off balance. She managed a smirk anyway, sliding back into safer territory. "Keep complimenting me and I might start believing you mean it."</p><p>Rio's grin softened into something warmer and unquestionably affectionate. "That's the goal, yeah," she held Agatha's gaze for a moment that felt eternal and brief at the same time before returning to swirling her fork in the pasta. "You deserve all the compliments after tonight."</p><p>Agatha's smirk faltered slightly, betraying the way the words landed. Compliments were easy to brush off when they were flippant or came with an agenda. But this was steady, disarming in its sincerity. She lowered her head to hide the sudden warmth climbing her cheeks, focusing on spearing another shrimp.</p><p>"You'll spoil me," she murmured after chewing for longer than necessary, her tone dry but not as sharp as she'd intended.</p><p>"I think you're the one spoiling <em>me</em> at the moment," Rio said, tipping her glass forward in a small toast before taking a long sip, the motion punctuated by a satisfied sigh. "And it's working. I can't even bring myself to be mad about the amount of money you undoubtedly spend to make this happen."</p><p>Agatha's first instinct was to roll her eyes, but the retort died on her tongue. She'd bought suits that could cover rent for a small apartment for half a year. She'd dropped thousands on dinners where the portions were so delicate they looked better in photographs than on a plate. Women she'd taken out before never questioned the excess - most didn't even bother with the pantomime of reaching for the check. And Agatha hadn't cared; the money was never the point. It was... the cost of keeping someone at her side, even for just one night.</p><p>But Rio wasn't like them. She wasn't born cushioned by wealth, wasn't dulled to extravagance by endless repetition. For her, money wasn't a casual tool or a disposable luxury - it carried weight. Agatha understood that. She understood why Rio might flinch at seeing so much of it bent toward a single night.</p><p>What she wished - achingly, selfishly - was that Rio could see it the way she did: not as wasted money, not as a display, but as proof. That she was worth every cent, every favor called in, every sleepless night spent planning this down to the last lantern. That no sum felt too steep when it brought her this - Rio here, laughing and luminous, across a table Agatha never wanted to leave.</p><p>She swirled the wine in her glass, letting Rio's words settle between them like the light on the grass. "Good," she said at last, her tone warm but edged with something deliberate. "Because I'd hate to think you resented me for it. Or that you see this as me throwing money around to impress you."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, eyes narrowing slightly in suspicion. "Isn't that a part of it?"</p><p>"No," Agatha said sternly. "I know I could've gone with something simpler. Something more... mundane." She thought about the pillow fort idea and pursed her lips. "But I wanted tonight to be worthy of you. And a simple restaurant or a walk in the park wouldn't cut it. Not when I have the means to spoil you, and it gives me this-" she gestured subtly between them, to the skyline that glittered in the distance like a promise, "-you, here, looking at me like that."</p><p>Rio blinked, her suspicion washed away by the directness, and Agatha felt a rush of satisfaction at catching her off guard.</p><p>She leaned back slightly, savoring the moment, and added in a low, velvety tone, "So no, you don't get to be mad about it. Not tonight. Consider it an indulgence... mine, not yours."</p><p>Rio's lips parted, the beginnings of a protest poised on her tongue, but then she shut them again, studying Agatha with an expression caught between exasperation and wonder. Slowly, she set her glass down, the faintest laugh escaping her.</p><p>"You can be impossible to argue with," she said, shaking her head. "I see why that lawyer thing is working out so well for you."</p><p>Agatha smirked, offering a shrug. "Years of practice. Though I enjoy winning with you a great deal more than in court."</p><p>Rio let out a laugh, bright and genuine, before leveling her with a look that carried more heat than humor. "Dangerous words, counselor. You keep that up, and I might start losing on purpose."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, her lips curving into something sly. "Bold words for someone so stubborn. Am I getting special treatment?"</p><p>"Maybe you are," Rio said, her smile tipping toward something softer, but not entirely stripped of its bite.</p><p>The words made Agatha's smirk waver, their warmth almost enough to melt it, but she powered through it, spearing the last bite of pasta on her plate. "I'll try not to let it swell my ego any more than it already has."</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. "I'm not taking the credit for that. Your ego's already been well-fed before you met me."</p><p>The banter pulled the tension back from the edge, lightening it just enough. Agatha took her chance, setting her fork down with a final clink. "Speaking of well-fed... time for dessert, don't you think?"</p><p>Rio's brows arched, curiosity sparkling in her eyes like stars on a cloudless night.</p><p>Agatha reached for the thermos sitting near the vase and poured its contents into two smaller cups, sliding one across the table. Steam curled into the air between them, carrying the scent of dark chocolate threaded with cinnamon and a faint bite of chili.</p><p>Rio inhaled, already smiling. "What is this?"</p><p>"Something to satiate your sweet tooth," Agatha said, easing back onto her cushion. "Puerto Rican hot chocolate. Thick, spiced, indulgent. The recipe's from a cafe in San Juan. Took some persuasion to pry it from them."</p><p>Rio's eyes flicked from the cup to her face, half incredulous, half delighted. "Of course you did." She wrapped her hands around the warmth, took a cautious sip, and the pleased hum that followed was better than any victory in court. "Just how much strong-arming did you do for this date?"</p><p>"I told you," Agatha mused with a shrug. "Tonight, no indulgence is yours to carry. It's mine. You only have to drink."</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly, setting the cup down, though the smile lingered on her lips. "It's unfair, you know. You sit there with your smirk and your romance and your sickeningly thoughtful, extravagant surprises, and I'm supposed to... what? Act like I'm not smitten? Like you're not impossible to resist?"</p><p>Agatha almost choked on air at the bluntness. She could only watch as Rio rose onto her knees and, with deliberate care, began rearranging the cushions so they faced outwards. The skyline unfurled in front of them, dark velvety sky scattered with stars, the city glittering like it was trying to keep pace.</p><p>Before Agatha could find her composure, Rio dropped back down, the light catching the glint in her eyes. She patted the space beside her, expectant. "Sit with me."</p><p>For a heartbeat, Agatha didn't move. She just looked at her - the sweater slightly askew from her earlier fidgeting, the soft flush on her cheeks from the wine, the sharp angles of her face softened by the glow of the lanterns. The request was simple, but the weight of it pressed into her ribs like a hand.</p><p>Finally, she rose, unnecessarily smoothing out her coat before circling the low table. The cushions sank under her added weight as she lowered herself beside Rio, accidentally brushing their shoulders. The contact sent a spark crawling up her arm.</p><p>Rio tilted her head toward her, looking victorious. "That's better. No table, no distractions. Just us."</p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh, though it lacked its usual sharpness. "I have a feeling you've been plotting this all along."</p><p>"Maybe I have," Rio teased, her voice dropping into something low and conspiratorial. "Maybe I got cold and needed something to keep me warm."</p><p>"That's what the chocolate's for," Agatha mused, reaching to the side to grab one of the additional blankets she'd arranged for. "And this."</p><p>She draped the blanket across both their laps, the wool catching lightly against their clothes, a deliberate tether binding them closer. Then she reached for the abandoned mugs and pressed one into Rio's hand. Their fingers brushed, and neither of them seemed in a hurry to break the contact. The moment stretched, warm and fragile, until Rio finally closed her hand around the cup, her thumb grazing Agatha's knuckle.</p><p>"Efficient and thoughtful," Rio said softly, eyes glinting as she lifted the drink. "Not that I'm surprised."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, tone wry to mask the sudden thrum in her chest. "What? No illusions shattered? No shocked gasps that I can be considerate?"</p><p>"Oh, I've known that for months now," Rio said, shifting slightly and making their knees brush under the blanket. "You put on a good show for everyone else, sure - sharp tongue, withering glares, perfect composure. But I've lived with you for five months. I've seen what's underneath. You're not fooling me."</p><p>The admission wasn't surprising. Agatha had known fooling Rio was impossible for months now, the sentiment punctuated by every inquisitive glance and accurate remark sent her way whenever she tried to readjust her mask in front of the woman.</p><p>Still, hearing it said like it was obvious made her feel exposed.</p><p>"People usually don't look close enough to see what's underneath," she said, eyes fixed on the city lights blinking in the distance. "Not that I can blame them. I've been told scaling my walls can be exhausting."</p><p>Rio shifted, adjusting her grip on the mug with her left hand while her right fell to the side, promptly disappearing under the blanket. The brush of warmth across Agatha's knee was light, accidental enough to ignore, but she didn't. Couldn't.</p><p>"Not exhausting," Rio muttered. "<em>Tiring</em>, maybe. Infuriating, considering you always try to make them taller when someone reaches the top. But not exhausting."</p><p>Agatha huffed out a sharp laugh. "You have such a way with words."</p><p>Rio's answering laugh came low, fond, a sound that vibrated through the quiet instead of disrupting it. "It <em>was </em>a challenge to see past your defences." She shifted closer, their shoulders pressing together now. "But when I did? I saw a woman willing to track down a flower without knowing its name because she thought it mattered to me. A woman who put this all together, even though it terrified her. And that woman, well, she's worth the climb."</p><p>The words startled Agatha into looking at her. Immediately, she found herself falling into warm, steady eyes, open in a way that made her chest ache.</p><p>She turned away quickly, retreating to the safer focus of the cup in her hands, steam curling upward in fragile spirals. Her voice came out low, almost hesitant, like she was admitting a secret she hadn't intended to voice. "If it makes you feel better, that woman probably didn't exist before you."</p><p>Rio's hand stilled mid-motion, her mug hovering just shy of her lips. Slowly, she set it aside, leaning forward to catch Agatha's gaze. "That's not true," she said softly, with the kind of conviction that left no room for argument. "She was always there. You just didn't let anyone close enough to see her."</p><p>Agatha let out a sigh, swirling the drink as though the motion could smooth the edges of her nerves. "Or maybe I didn't want to believe she could exist. It's easier to have sharp edges. To be unapproachable. It sets the bar low enough to avoid disappointment."</p><p>Under the blanket, Rio's hand shifted, brushing against her knee again - this time intentionally. She didn't rush, didn't press, just let her fingers linger, waiting.</p><p>Agatha's breath caught, but she didn't pull away. Her left hand loosened its death grip on the cup, slipping beneath the blanket until her fingers curled tentatively around Rio's. The contact was small, almost tentative, but it grounded her more than she wanted to admit.</p><p>"It's not easy," Agatha murmured. "For either of us."</p><p>"It's not," Rio agreed. Her thumb traced a slow line across the back of Agatha's hand, the kind of absent, intimate motion that could undo her entirely. "You drive me insane sometimes. You push people away even when you're pulling them closer. But-" She tilted her head, catching Agatha's reluctant gaze with gentle insistence. "I wouldn't be here if you weren't worth it."</p><p>The honesty in Rio's voice settled deep, bypassing all of Agatha's carefully constructed armor. Her throat tightened, words coming out rougher than she intended. "You're going to ruin me."</p><p>Rio's lips curved into the faintest smile, not mocking, not even triumphant - just unbearably warm. She leaned in slightly, so close Agatha felt her breath stir the air between them. "Maybe. Or maybe I'll just make you better."</p><p>The words lingered between them, settling into the silence like a promise neither had spoken aloud. Agatha's grip on Rio's hand tightened, the weight of it grounding her, steadying her racing pulse.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, eyes searching hers in the lanterlight. Not questioning. Not demanding. Just <em>waiting</em>.</p><p>They had already shared a handful of kisses, all on the day they had finally spoken aloud what had been simmering between them. Agatha remembered every one of them - the searing heat of the first, as if it had burned through every wall she'd spent years building; the gentleness of the second, hesitant but sweet, like Rio was afraid to spook her; the easiness of the third that felt like a promise. She remembered the curve of Rio's smile pressed against her own, the way laughter had slipped into their mouths before turning into something slower after discussing the beginnings of their relationship.</p><p>Those memories thrummed through her now, making the present moment feel like stepping back into a current she had never really left.</p><p>Her chest tightened, but she didn't hesitate. She leaned forward, her hand tightening around Rio's as if afraid the woman would move away. But she didn't. She met Agatha halfway, her lips soft and warm, and the kiss was neither desperate nor cautious - it was something in between, balanced and certain, like they both already knew the shape of this.</p><p>Agatha breathed her in, let the world narrow to the brush of lips, the faint slide of breath, the warmth blooming low in her chest. It wasn't the shock of discovery this time. It was confirmation. Continuation. Proof that the first time hadn't been a fragile fluke but the start of something that wanted to root itself deeper.</p><p>When they parted, it was barely an inch, close enough for Agatha to still feel the ghost of the kiss clinging to her mouth. She opened her eyes to find Rio watching her with an expression so unguarded, so unflinchingly tender, that it nearly undid her.</p><p>"Careful, gorgeous," Rio murmured, voice low and teasing. "Kiss me like that again and you'll have a very hard time getting rid of me."</p><p>Agatha's laugh was a soft huff, somewhere between exasperation and affection. "You talk too much," she said, and before Rio could fire back, Agatha caught her mouth in another kiss.</p><p>This one was different. It was fuller, hungrier, carrying the spark Rio's teasing had lit. Rio made a small sound against her lips, surprised but pleased, and tilted her head for a better angle. Agatha blindly set her mug aside, twisting her torso to follow the silent request as her hand slid out of Rio's grasp and surged up to rest against the back of the woman's neck. A second later, a warm hand brushed against her jaw, pulling her even closer.</p><p>The kiss deepened, breaths mingling, heat building between them in a way that made the rest of the world blur. It wasn't rushed, but there was a pull to it, a sense of inevitability that left Agatha's pulse thrumming in her ears. She angled her head, coaxing Rio's lips open just enough to taste the sweetness of chocolate lingering there.</p><p>By the time she pulled back, they were both a little breathless, foreheads nearly touching. Rio's lips were kiss-bruised, her grin lopsided, her eyes shining with something Agatha couldn't name without terrifying herself.</p><p>"Point taken," Rio whispered, voice husky with amusement.</p><p>Agatha smirked, letting her hand fall back onto her lap. "Good."</p><p>Her smirk faltered when Rio's hand, still warm against her jaw, shifted upward. Fingers threaded slowly into her hair, careful at first, then bolder, curling into the dark strands and giving the faintest tug. Agatha's breath hitched before she could stop it.</p><p>"You left it down," Rio murmured, fingertips combing idly through the silky waves. Her lips stretched in a wicked grin. "Any specific reason?"</p><p>Agatha forced a dry laugh, trying to mask the flush creeping up her neck. "Efficiency. I didn't want to be late, and this saved me at least ten minutes."</p><p>"Mm," Rio hummed, utterly unconvinced. She twirled a lock around her finger before letting it slip free, then did it again, slow enough to feel more intimate than the kiss they'd just shared. "And here I was, thinking you already knew I like it better this way."</p><p>The sharp retort melted on Agatha's tongue when Rio's short nails scraped against the base of her skull, sending a shiver down her spine. Before she realized what was happening, she found herself leaning in, the hand in her hair coaxing her closer until her temple brushed against Rio's shoulder. The contact was soft, deceptively simple, but her pulse thrummed as if she'd stepped off a cliff.</p><p>"Dangerous assumption," she muttered, wrestling against the instinct to close her eyes under Rio's gentle touch. "Basing my hairstyle on what <em>you</em> like."</p><p>Rio chuckled, the sound reverberating through her chest and into Agatha through every point of contact. "Considering the lengths you'd gone to for this date, I think my theory isn't that far-fetched."</p><p>"As a scientist, you should know a baseless idea is just conjecture," Agatha murmured, though her voice was too soft to sting.</p><p>"And as a lawyer," Rio said, tipping her head slightly so her cheek brushed against Agatha's crown, "you should know pretending evidence doesn't exist is less 'strategy' and more 'career suicide.'"</p><p>Agatha tilted her head just enough to give her a flat look, though she felt the corners of her mouth rise involuntarily. "Evidence?"</p><p>"Exhibit A," Rio said smoothly. "You put together a date that could easily make an appearance in Hollywood's next hit."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, fighting the pull of a smile. "That's circumstantial at best."</p><p>"Exhibit B," Rio twirled a lock of Agatha's hair around her finger before letting it slide free. "You left this down, knowing I can't resist it."</p><p>Agatha's lips parted, ready to argue, but Rio wasn't finished.</p><p>"And Exhibit C," she added, voice dropping low enough to tangle with the night air, "you're still here. On my shoulder. Letting me present the so-called 'non-existing evidence.'"</p><p>"Smugness doesn't suit you," Agatha grumbled, though her temple pressed further into Rio's sweater. "Especially when your case wouldn't stand five minutes in court."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, the teasing curve of her lips brushing Agatha's hair. "Spoken like someone who's just been defeated."</p><p>"I thought we agreed you'd let me win arguments."</p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh that spread warmth across Agatha's scalp. "I don't remember signing anything," she teased. "And special treatment only goes so far. I'm not letting you win when you're clearly wrong."</p><p>"I'd at least get a chance to present my case in court," Agatha noticed, finding it hard to sound stern when Rio's fingers kept tracing lazy patterns in her hair. "There hasn't been a verdict yet."</p><p>Rio's cheek pushed further into her crown. "The verdict is that you like me," she said softly before her voice grew more teasing. "And that you kept your hair down to drive me insane."</p><p>"Objection."</p><p>"Overruled."</p><p>Agatha scoffed, tilting her head just enough to glare up at her. "This court is a mess. Are you the counselor or the judge?"</p><p>Rio's smile stretched wide, her eyes gleaming with mischief. "Both - and I don't take bribes, gorgeous."</p><p>Agatha's brain stuttered for a beat, her lips parting on a retort that wouldn't form. Finally, with a sharp sound somewhere between a groan and a laugh, she caught Rio's chin and pulled her into another kiss, this one heated and impatient, meaning to shut her up.</p><p>Rio let it last for all of five seconds before smiling against her mouth, her hand sliding deeper into Agatha's hair. "I'll rethink my anti-bribery stance," she whispered, breath fanning her lips.</p><p>"This is the easiest case of my career," Agatha chuckled, leaning in to steal another kiss when she felt a cool drop land on her cheek. Then another, sliding down the slope of her nose. She froze, pulling back just enough to glance upward.</p><p>"No," she whispered, horror creeping into her voice as the first sprinkle darkened the blanket around them. She pulled back fully, scanning the sky as if she could intimidate the clouds into submission. "No, no, no - it wasn't supposed to rain. I checked the weather at least ten times."</p><p>Rio blinked, the corners of her lips twitching like she was fighting back a smile. "Agatha. It's alright."</p><p>"It's not alright!" Agatha snapped, springing to her feet to grab the wine bottle and shield it under her coat like it was an endangered species. "We were supposed to go on a walk after dinner. The forecast said clear skies!"</p><p>Rio stood more slowly, pushing the slightly damp blanket aside. She watched Agatha dart around like a storm-stricken cat for a moment before sliding a hand through the wet curls sticking to her forehead, utterly unbothered. Then she stepped forward, caught Agatha's wrist, and tugged just enough to make her pause.</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>Agatha whipped around, water already dripping from her lashes. "What?"</p><p>Rio's grin softened into something maddeningly serene. She tilted her face toward the rain for a beat, eyes closing, and when she looked back, her voice was low, coaxing. "Dance with me."</p><p>"Dance?" Agatha repeated, too stunned by the peculiar request to react when Rio reached into her coat to put the wine bottle back on the table. "There's no music."</p><p>"There isn't," Rio agreed, twining their fingers together and pulling her into the open space of the clearing.</p><p>"And it's raining."</p><p>Rio hummed, settling a hand on Agatha's waist like it belonged there. "Astute observation."</p><p>"We could get sick."</p><p>"We could," Rio said easily, gently directing Agatha's right hand to rest against her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha stared at her like she'd lost her mind. "You can't be serious."</p><p>Rio only smiled, rain running down her cheekbones like liquid silver. "Dead serious." Her other hand pressed against the small of Agatha's back, drawing her closer. "Come on. You went through all this trouble to make tonight perfect. Lanterns, flowers, the skyline... every detail like something out of a dream." She paused, searching Agatha's face. "I don't want it to end."</p><p>Agatha's throat worked, the words hitting somewhere deep and warm. She'd thought she had everything accounted for - checked the forecast obsessively, arranged backup blankets, even tested the sightlines from the hill twice. And yet, here it was, all unraveling under the weight of a sky she couldn't control. The rain threatened to wash her careful staging away, to reduce the night to soaked clothes and ruined plans.</p><p>The panic was instinctual - because what if this ruined everything? What if Rio looked back on this night and remembered discomfort instead of magic?</p><p>But Rio was still smiling at her, makeup slightly smudged from the rain, her hands steady and sure. She wasn't seeing the sky's betrayal as a failure. She wasn't looking past the dripping lanterns and damp blankets to tally Agatha's mistakes. She was looking at <em>her</em>.</p><p>And for the first time that evening, Agatha realized she didn't need perfection.</p><p>"You're insane," she muttered, even as her other hand found its way to Rio's shoulder. Her pulse thudded in her ears, nearly drowning out the patter of rain. "Completely insane."</p><p>Rio stepped closer, guiding them into the faintest sway, their shoes slipping slightly on the wet grass. "Maybe," she admitted softly. "But I'm not ready to stop being here with you."</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, letting herself move with her despite every voice in her head telling her this wasn't how it was supposed to go. There was an unchecked box on her agenda, a path lined with lanterns, waiting for their arrival.</p><p>And yet, with Rio's warmth pressed against her and the city glittering in the distance, she couldn't help but think that maybe this was better than any plan she could've made.</p><p>They swayed in silence, the drizzle slowly turning into rain that had droplets cling to their lashes and roll down their cheeks like misplaced tears. The blankets, the dishes, the carefully arranged lanterns all blurred into the background. All that remained sharp was the curve of Rio's smile and the steady cadence of her breath.</p><p>Agatha tightened her hold around Rio's shoulders to ground herself in the moment. It wasn't the date she'd envisioned, not the flawless, glittering night she'd tried so hard to orchestrate. But as Rio's hands slid under her coat to rest against the small of her back, leaving a trail of rainwater behind as if marking their path, Agatha found herself smiling.</p><p>That alone felt more real than anything she could've planned.</p><p>Eventually, Rio tilted her head back, rain dripping from her hair as she met Agatha's eye. "See? Not so bad," she murmured, her words nearly swallowed by the night.</p><p>Before Agatha could find a reply, Rio leaned in and kissed her - slow, unhurried, utterly unconcerned with the rain soaking them both. Agatha melted into it, her hand sliding into Rio's damp hair, deepening the kiss until time felt suspended. The storm could have drowned the world around them, and she wouldn't have cared.</p><p>They broke apart only when breathing became necessary, foreheads pressed together, both of them smiling like fools in the rain.</p><p>The moment stretched, neither willing to let it go, but eventually the chill began to seep through the last layers of warmth. Reluctantly, Rio pulled back just enough to whisper, "We should probably go before one of us catches pneumonia."</p><p>"Probably," Agatha agreed, though she made no move to retract her arms from around Rio's shoulders. "But I believe there's still a question to be asked."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>If Agatha's heart wasn't trying to pound out of her chest, she would've found the lack of recognition amusing. Instead, her voice dropped lower, steadier than she felt. "This was one of the best nights of my life," she admitted slowly, fingers flexing at the nape of Rio's neck, almost digging into the damp skin. "And if there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I'm greedy by nature."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, eyes sharp and soft all at once. "Greedy, huh?"</p><p>Agatha drew in a breath, the words catching on her tongue before she pushed them out, deliberate, certain. "I want more than this night, Rio. I want all of it. I want you. Not just as my wife in some contract, not as a partner in a ruse, but-" she hesitated, pulse roaring in her ears, "-as my girlfriend. Properly. Truly."</p><p>For a moment, the rain and the world around them went silent. Rio's lips parted, her breath a soft hitch, and then she laughed - bright, incredulous, delighted - like the answer had been written in her bones long before Agatha asked.</p><p>"Fucking finally," she murmured, leaning in close enough that her smile brushed against Agatha's lips. "I thought you'd never ask."</p><p>Agatha didn't give her the chance to say more. She caught Rio's mouth in another kiss, rain slick on their skin, greedy in every way she'd just confessed to being.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The house was quiet in a way that felt rare for a Sunday morning. With the end of the soccer season, weekends had been stripped of the flurry of cleats, nylon, and rushed breakfasts, ebbing into something quieter until the fall season would kick in. There was just the sunlight stretching across her bedroom floor and the faint breeze through the cracked window carrying the smell of freshly cut grass from a neighbor's yard.</p><p>Agatha lay still in the sheets longer than she normally would, letting herself drift in the space between sleep and thought. Last night clung to her - the lanterns, the wine, Rio's laughter, the rain cooling her skin just before lips found lips again. She'd replayed it half a dozen times already, and she knew she'd replay it half a dozen more before breakfast.</p><p>Her eyes fell to her left hand on top of the cotton sheets. Bare. The ring sat in her coat pocket downstairs, where she'd left it deliberately, unable to put it back on.</p><p>Maybe it was foolish - a child's trick of pretending the night wasn't over by clinging to the smallest symbol. But Rio hadn't slipped her own band back on either, and Agatha refused to be the one to break the spell that had carried them all the way from the garden to home.</p><p>The drive back had been quiet in the best way. The kind of silence that wasn't strained or awkward but heavy with the aftertaste of something unsaid and everything already known. The windshield wipers had beaten their steady rhythm against the lingering drizzle, and every now and then, Rio's reflection in the glow had caught the faint glow of streetlights. A profile softened by the night, lips curved slightly as though the memory of their rain-slicked kiss lingered there.</p><p>Agatha had kept both hands on the wheel, knowing that Rio wouldn't have appreciated driving one-handed in the rain, but her palms itched with the urge to reach out and brush the damp curls away from Rio's cheek or trace the drops sliding down the tan throat. It had almost made her run a red light, which had earned a half-amused, half-exasperated huff from the woman distracting her by existing.</p><p>When they'd pulled into the garage, reality had washed over Agatha like a cold wave, only partially warmed by the gentle squeeze Rio had wrapped her fingers in before slipping away toward the stairs. It had been a fleeting thing, soft enough to be missed, but she'd felt it linger even as she forced her expression back into neutrality.</p><p>Sharon's scrutinizing stare had met her in the living room, blue eyes filled with sharp curiosity as they studied her soaked clothes and disheveled hair. Agatha had barely noticed, bidding the woman a clipped goodnight and showing her toward the door in brisk steps before retreating upstairs, her left hand unapologetically bare.</p><p>Now, in the hush of the morning, Agatha traced her thumb over the empty band of skin where the ring usually rested. The indentation was faint but there, an echo of a weight she'd worn long enough to carve its own space into her skin. She knew she'd have to put it back on the moment she went downstairs. Appearances had to be kept - the arrangement demanded it.</p><p>But last night had made the ring feel like a lie more than ever.</p><p>Getting used to its absence seemed easier than learning to ignore its presence. Yet not wearing it was a luxury she couldn't afford, even in her home. Not with Nicky's sharp, perceptive eyes always watching, cataloging, questioning. The boy missed nothing, and as relieved as Agatha was that he'd gotten her quick mind, her life would've been much easier if he hadn't inherited her perceptiveness. If she slipped even once, he'd see it. And she wasn't ready to untangle the explanation that would have to follow.</p><p>She exhaled, pressing the heel of her palm against her brow. A part of her thought it had been easier, once. Pretending. Keeping everything compartmentalized - the mother, the lawyer, the wife on paper. Before Rio had come crashing into all those carefully built walls and derailing every plan.</p><p>But Agatha knew that part was wrong. It hadn't been easier, at least not after a few months. Pretending had gotten more challenging. Compartmentalization had become almost painful, like the truth wanted to claw its way out of her chest. The walls, no matter how much time she'd spent reinforcing them, had refused to stay up.</p><p>It hadn't been easier, just familiar. Familiar in the way she'd once convinced herself that silence was safer than wanting, that detachment was preferable to risk. Familiar like the ache of ignoring her own needs and clinging to logic the same way a drowning woman clung to driftwood.</p><p>And now? Now there was Rio, who looked at her like she'd never been impossible to want, who made space in her own chest for Agatha to fall into without asking for permission first. Who turned a simple act of leaving her hair down into an unraveling, and the rain into something worth remembering.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, sitting up on the bed as if she could outrun the tide threatening to spill over. Last night, she hadn't wanted to contain it. Last night, she'd let herself want.</p><p>But now, it was morning, and the spell had worn off.</p><p>A floorboard groaned somewhere below, faint but unmistakable. Nicky, most likely. She pushed the covers back and swung her legs out of the bed.</p><p>She moved on autopilot - soft gray sweatpants, an old cotton shirt, hair twisted back into a bun. It wasn't the polished mask she wore to court, or the outfit she'd chosen for Rio last night. It was comfort. It was neutral. It was safe.</p><p>The sounds coming from the kitchen reached her at the top of the stairs. Nicky had to be making himself breakfast. Cereal, probably, since despite his declarations that he was old enough to use the toaster, she still refused to bend to his will. Especially when even <em>she</em> sometimes had to air out the kitchen after burning one toast too many.</p><p>Her coat still hung on the rack by the door where she'd left it last night. She slipped a hand into the pocket, noting that the fabric was already mostly dry, and closed her fingers around the cool metal hidden inside. The ring caught on her knuckles as she pulled it out, the glint of gold sharp even in the dim hall.</p><p>For a moment, she stood perfectly still, staring at the band. It would have to go back on before Nicky saw her. Pretending might feel unbearable after last night, but it was still necessary. Even if Nicky didn't notice the emptiness on her finger, she could grow too comfortable without the reminder and get sloppy. And the last thing they needed was somebody noticing her walking around the streets without the ring to keep up the charade.</p><p>With a sigh, she slid it onto her finger, the metal cold against her skin, and flexed her hand as though testing its weight again. Something in her gut tightened uncomfortably, but she ignored the feeling, moving toward the kitchen.</p><p>The sounds hit her first - the soft scrape of a spatula, the quiet hiss of butter on a pan. Not cereal, which meant-</p><p>Agatha froze in the doorway, one hand braced against the frame.</p><p>Rio hadn't noticed her yet. She was focused on the skillet, spatula in hand, humming faintly under her breath to some tune Agatha didn't recognize. The sleeves of her loose shirt were pushed up to her elbows, exposing the lean lines of her forearms as she coaxed another piece of bread to golden perfection. A stray curl had escaped and hung in her face, and she puffed it away absently, muttering something too low to catch.</p><p>The sight wasn't anything new. Agatha had seen Rio like this before - barefoot, hair loose, the quiet morning woven through with the smells and sounds of their kitchen while she blinked the last of her sleep away. It was ordinary in every sense, unremarkable to anyone else, but to Agatha it was a temptation dressed in simplicity.</p><p>So she had taught herself not to look. To pass by with a clipped greeting, to focus on her coffee or her phone, to anchor herself in anything but the curve of Rio's smile or the soft hum under her breath. She had convinced herself that discipline was protection, that if she didn't linger, she wouldn't unravel.</p><p>Because Rio hadn't been hers to look at. The warmth of mornings like this, the quiet intimacy of sharing space without pretense - those weren't hers to crave. They belonged to the performance, to the contract, to everything their life together was supposed to mean and nothing it actually did.</p><p>Now, standing there in the doorway, Agatha finally let herself look. The rules had changed - Rio was her <em>girlfriend</em>, and that simple truth shifted the ground beneath her feet. It gave her permission she hadn't dared claim before, and suddenly the mundane felt miraculous.</p><p>She stared in quiet wonder, struck by the sight as though seeing it for the first time - the loose fall of Rio's hair brushing her shoulders, the careless sway of her body as she moved between stove and counter, the faint tune hummed under her breath. It was ridiculous how something so ordinary could feel so precious, like stumbling into a dream she hadn't known she'd been chasing.</p><p>Agatha felt like a child who had wandered into a candy shop for the very first time, greedy to drink in every detail before someone noticed, before the spell broke, before reality had the chance to remind her that moments like this weren't supposed to belong to her.</p><p>Of course, the person who decided to break the spell was the same one who cast it.</p><p>"Not that I don't find the ominous looming in the doorway funny, but you do realize you can enter, right?" Rio asked without turning, left hand plucking an AirPod out of her ear and tucking it into its case in one smooth motion. "Or are you secretly a vampire and require permission?"</p><p>Agatha blinked as if yanked out of a daydream before rolling her eyes. "That rule only applies to entering the house. And even then, I doubt it's binding when the house already belongs to the vampire," she said, finally crossing the threshold and letting her hip rest against the island like she'd been invited all along.</p><p>Rio's chuckle was soft and unguarded, the sound curling warm in the kitchen like the scent of cinnamon and sugar. She eased the finished pieces onto a plate and reached for another slice of bread, brows knitting slightly as she dipped it into the batter. "I don't know what's more interesting," she said, voice laced with mock suspicion, "that you know vampire lore... or that you still haven't denied being one."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, letting her gaze linger on Rio's back longer than necessary. "A good attorney never denies anything unnecessarily," she murmured, sticking her favorite mug under the coffee machine's nozzles. It promptly whirled to life, the mechanical grinding mixing with Agatha's voice. "We prefer to let the jury draw their own conclusions."</p><p>That earned her a sideways glance, quick and sharp, accompanied by the beginnings of a grin. "So you <em>are</em> a vampire," Rio said with exaggerated certainty. "That explains so much, actually. Your aversion to the sun included."</p><p>"I don't have an aversion," Agatha grumbled, grabbing her finished coffee and leaning back against the counter. "I burn easily."</p><p>"Yeah, that's kind of a given for vampires."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes again, but couldn't quite suppress the small smile tugging at her mouth. The bickering was so familiar, so <em>them</em>, that for a heartbeat it felt like nothing had changed at all. And yet everything had.</p><p>She wasn't well-versed in relationships - truthfully, she wasn't versed in them at all. The handful of flings she'd tolerated had never stretched far enough to become domestic mornings or shared breakfasts. By all logic, this one shouldn't have, either. They'd only been dating for less than twenty-four hours. If it had been anyone else, Agatha would've had them leave her house before Nicky could see them.</p><p>But it was <em>Rio</em>, the person she'd been married to for over five months. The person she'd seen barefoot in her kitchen more times than she could count. The person who had agreed to be her girlfriend approximately eleven hours before.</p><p>The dichotomy of it was enough to send a seasoned romantic running for the hills - let alone Agatha, who had only allowed herself to admit she <em>wanted</em> a relationship a little over a week ago.</p><p>But then Rio set the spatula down and turned to face her properly, smiling in a way that made Agatha's chest both ache and lighten. And in that moment, all the knots and contradictions didn't matter. Because despite how strange this was - or maybe because of it - this morning felt startingly, dangerously real.</p><p>"I think this is the first time I'm seeing you smile so early in the morning," Rio teased, leaning back against the counter, arms crossing loosely. "Any specific reason?"</p><p>Agatha tried to will the corners of her mouth into submission, but they betrayed her, stubbornly curved upward as though her muscles had sided with Rio. "Just grateful," she said airily, lifting her mug to disguise the expression.</p><p>Rio's grin widened, and she tilted forward ever so slightly, as if resisting the urge to bridge the space between them. "Grateful?"</p><p>"Mm," Agatha hummed, taking a deliberately slow sip of her coffee, aware of Rio's eyes tracking every motion like a predator humoring its prey. She let the pause stretch before adding, "I half-expected to wake up with a sore throat. Or a nasty cough. But I'm as healthy as ever."</p><p>Rio blinked, then let out a short laugh that melted into a pout, her lips curving down dramatically. "Really? I dance with you in the rain and make you French toast, and your big revelation is that you don't have the sniffles?"</p><p>Agatha lowered her mug just enough to smirk over the rim. "Neither of us will be having French toast if you let it burn."</p><p>"Unbelievable," Rio grumbled, but obediently turned back to the stove to finish their breakfast. "I thought you were grateful for bagging an <em>incredible </em>new girlfriend, but apparently, I rank below a functioning immune system."</p><p>The word <em>girlfriend</em> rang in Agatha's ears like a gunshot at the start of a race, sharp and impossible to ignore. For a flicker of a second, her chest tightened. Should she dial down the teasing now? Adjust? Their date last night had been full of jokes and playful barbs, but what if that was what Rio tolerated from a potential love interest - not from her actual girlfriend? Agatha might have found comfort in the familiar rhythm of their banter, but that didn't guarantee Rio did too. Now that the label was real, it carried weight. Expectations. Rules she didn't know, hadn't studied, couldn't predict.</p><p>What if she got it wrong? What if she already had?</p><p>Agatha worried her lower lip with her teeth, setting the mug aside as she stared at Rio's back.</p><p>She had to say something, <em>do</em> something before Rio decided she'd made a mistake.</p><p>Before she could think better of it, she closed the space between them, sliding her hands around Rio's waist with a motion that felt clumsy the second she committed to it. Her fingers hovered for a beat too long before settling, palms splayed like she was testing unfamiliar ground. And maybe she was. Wasn't this what people did when they had girlfriends? Surely this was the right move - showing affection instead of hiding behind barbs and sarcasm. Surely this was better.</p><p>"I suppose," Agatha said, voice tighter than she intended as she awkwardly tipped her chin down onto Rio's shoulder, "I can be grateful for two things."</p><p>The position felt wrong immediately - too heavy, too hesitant, too obvious that she didn't know what she was doing. Her jaw hovered at an angle before she finally rested it, stiff and unnatural, as if the weight of her own head was a burden Rio shouldn't have to bear. Still, the warmth of the body pressed against hers bled into her the moment they touched, soft cotton and steady heat wrapping around her like something she hadn't known she was missing. If only her heart would cooperate, stop pounding so violently that she was sure Rio could feel it against her back. She tightened her arms slightly, trying to make up for the lack of ease with pressure - let the touch do the talking, say the things her words couldn't.</p><p>But then she felt it. The faint stiffening beneath her hands. The subtle way Rio's frame locked up, shoulders rising just enough to register. The spatula stilled mid-motion, gripped so tightly that Agatha could see the small tremor in Rio's knuckles. A sharp exhale escaped her - quick, surprised, like she hadn't been expecting contact at all.</p><p>Agatha froze too. Her body snapped taut in reflex, chin lifting slightly as if to undo the mistake. Her hands twitched against Rio's waist before she began to retract them, already bracing herself for the sting of rejection. Strike two, and the day had barely started.</p><p>But before she could retreat, Rio shifted - not away, but back into her. The subtle lean of her spine softened, pressing into Agatha's chest, her voice low and steady.</p><p>"Don't," she murmured. Not commanding, not desperate - just certain.</p><p>The word alone rooted Agatha in place. Her fingers stilled where they hovered mid-release, at the edge of retreat, then slowly settled back against Rio's middle. The tension in Rio's shoulders gave way, unspooling in increments, until the spatula was moving again, scraping gently against the pan.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her throat dry. She'd thought about this moment more times than she was comfortable admitting. Every time she'd seen Rio like this in the kitchen, her palms itched to reach out, to touch. And now she could. Now, Rio was letting her, leaning into her as if she'd been thinking about it too.</p><p>Determined to rectify the stumble from earlier, Agatha lowered her head by fractions, heart hammering so loudly it almost drowned out the faint sizzle from the stove. She pressed her lips to the sliver of bare skin revealed by Rio's collar, warm and soft beneath her mouth. It was barely a kiss, more a brush, but it still sent something sharp and electric down her spine.</p><p>The reaction was instant. A shudder rolled visibly through Rio's body, so strong it startled Agatha into stillness. The spatula clattered noisily against the pan, forgotten, the sound sharp enough to make her flinch. Before she could process whether she'd gone too far, Rio turned in her arms with such suddenness that Agatha's breath caught.</p><p>They were chest to chest now, close enough that the unruly curl hanging over Rio's face brushed her cheek. Brown eyes flashed at her, wide, unreadable, as if Rio herself hadn't expected her body to betray her like that. For a beat, they just stared, suspended in that electric air, Agatha's lips tingling with phantom heat.</p><p>Then Rio's mouth curved - slow, crooked, dangerous. "Our breakfast <em>will</em> burn if you keep being cute and distracting," she said, her voice low as she made no move to disentangle herself from Agatha's grip. Instead, her hands ran up the arms locked around her waist before wrapping around Agatha's elbows, delicately keeping her in place. "Not that I'm complaining."</p><p>"I-" Agatha hesitated, pushing down the quip clawing its way up her throat. This was going to be harder than she expected, considering sarcasm and teasing jabs were her factory setting. She wet her lips with her tongue, missing the way Rio's eyes followed the motion. "-am showing my gratitude."</p><p>Rio tilted her head, raising her brows like she knew the words weren't Agatha's first thought. "Oh?" she hummed. "Then by all means, continue."</p><p>Agatha's pulse spiked harder, almost enough to make her consider if she was going into cardiac arrest. She swallowed and forced her body not to retreat under Rio's searching gaze, her hands flexing against the woman's waist as though trying to ground herself.</p><p><em>You're being pathetic</em>, she thought grimly. <em>Here you are, holding your girlfriend as she's making you breakfast, and you're fighting with yourself to show affection. What the fuck is wrong with you?</em></p><p>Before the moment could stretch for too long, Agatha straightened up, lips brushing against Rio's temple in a gesture so uncharacteristically tender that she half-expected lightning to strike her where she stood.</p><p>Rio inhaled sharply, the sound catching between them. Then her laugh came, quiet and breathless, more like disbelief than amusement. "God, Agatha," she whispered, tightening her grip around her elbows as if to anchor herself. "You can't just do <em>that</em> and expect me to remember there's food on the stove."</p><p>A sharp smell hit the air, and Agatha finally noticed the faint smoke curling up from the pan. She blinked, taking a reflexive step back to let Rio salvage whatever was left of the bread, but Rio followed her like there was a magnetic field pulling her in.</p><p>One hand slid off her elbow, blindly reaching to flick off the burner, while the other pulled her forward, pressing their foreheads together.</p><p>"Rio, the food-"</p><p>"I'll get back to it in a minute," Rio interrupted the weak protest with an almost impish smile, reaching for Agatha's jaw. "You're not the only grateful one here."</p><p>Before Agatha could say anything, Rio's lips were on hers, slow and tender.</p><p>The kiss caught Agatha off guard, not because it was unfamiliar, but because of how unhurried it was. Rio kissed her like it was the most natural thing in the world to stand together in the kitchen, wrapped in each other, in the hush of a slow Sunday morning.</p><p>Agatha's chest tightened. It was easier to navigate when she had walls, when she could pretend this wasn't what she wanted. But with Rio's hand warm against her jaw and her mouth moving with such deliberate gentleness, all those defenses dissolved like sugar in coffee.</p><p>Her hands, stiff at Rio's hips, betrayed her resolve and slid up to anchor at Rio's back. She pressed closer, giving in, letting herself drown for a moment in the quiet certainty of being wanted.</p><p>When Rio finally drew back, their noses brushed, and she lingered there, smiling like she knew every thought racing through Agatha's head. "See?" she murmured, voice low but steady. "Gratitude goes both ways."</p><p>Once again, the quip rose immediately to Agatha's tongue - something about Rio's overconfidence, or how gratitude wasn't usually expressed by burning breakfast. The kind of jab she'd tossed out easily before last night.</p><p>But now the rules had changed. <em>They</em> had changed.</p><p>Her pulse hammered, panic brushing at her ribs as the silence stretched. Finally, she forced out something softer, smaller. "It does," she admitted, almost clumsy with the way her lips formed the words. She let her hands fall back to her sides and stepped out of Rio's orbit, as though space might help her find her footing.</p><p>Rio's brow lifted, the flicker of surprise at the uncharacteristic restraint clear on her face, but before she could say anything, another voice cut through the kitchen.</p><p>"Mama? Did you burn something again? It smells funny!"</p><p>Agatha blinked, the sound of her son's shout cracking through the closeness like a whip. She took another step back, smoothing out her clothes as if Nicky could see her from upstairs.</p><p>"No, baby!" she called out, watching Rio turn back to the stove to assess the damage. "Nothing's on fire."</p><p>Except maybe her cheeks, but Nicky didn't have to know that.</p><p>"'kay!"</p><p>The floorboards above creaked, followed by a door clicking shut as he went back to his room, presumably to change out of his pajamas. Agatha exhaled slowly, letting her eyes fall shut for a moment.</p><p>It would be fine. Once Nicky came down for breakfast, she could focus on him more than on the new, unfamiliar dynamics with Rio. Besides, they'd agreed not to clue him in on their new relationship status, so she could blame any possible stumble on his presence.</p><p>Maybe making her son a scapegoat for her romantic shortcomings was a vile move, but it was all she had at the moment.</p><p>"Alright, the butter burned <em>slightly</em>, but these are still perfectly-" Agatha's eyes snapped open, immediately colliding with Rio's worried gaze.</p><p>"You okay?" Rio asked softly, spatula hovering in her hand as though breakfast could wait.</p><p>Agatha's mouth worked soundlessly for a beat. The reflex - the easy denial, the dry quip - sprang to her lips like muscle memory. <em>Why wouldn't I be? Because I'm standing here terrified of saying the wrong thing? Because I don't know how to be someone's girlfriend without fumbling every fucking second of it?</em></p><p>"Why wouldn't I-" she cut herself off, jaw tightening before she forced a breath through her nose. Her voice came out quieter when she tried, almost fragile. "I'm great."</p><p>Rio's frown only deepened as she studied Agatha, like she could feel the shape of the lie, even if she couldn't name it.</p><p>Agatha's fingers curled around the mug she'd grabbed to stop herself from reaching for the woman again. That was the problem with letting someone in - they noticed when you faltered. They cared enough to look closely.</p><p>"Is it... because of Nicky?" Rio asked after a beat, her voice careful and low. "That he might've heard? Or that-" she hesitated, glancing toward the ceiling where the boy could be heard stomping around his room, "-that we weren't supposed to be..."</p><p>Her free hand gestured vaguely between them, as though the touches and the kiss were suddenly fragile, something Agatha might regret in the sanctity of their house.</p><p>Agatha blinked, taken aback. "No," she said too quickly, the word escaping like a reflex. She forced herself to soften it, unclenching her jaw. "No. We're good."</p><p>Rio's shoulders eased a fraction, though her gaze stayed sharp, skeptical. She wasn't the type to stop caring just because Agatha said so.</p><p>Agatha fiddled with the mug, the lukewarm coffee already staining the ceramic. She wished she could tell Rio the truth - that she wasn't uncomfortable with the affection at all, that it terrified her how <em>much</em> she wanted it, how badly she wanted to get it right. But admitting that aloud felt like a foreign concept.</p><p>Instead, she breathed out slowly, holding Rio's eyes. "I promise."</p><p>Something in her tone must have landed, because Rio finally nodded, though not without brushing her fingers against Agatha's white-knuckled grip - a fleeting, grounding touch that lingered even after she'd turned back to the stove.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, swallowing the sigh of relief pressing against her ribs. She pivoted toward the fridge, automatically reaching for the apple juice Nicky would undoubtedly want the second his feet hit the kitchen tile. But her eyes snagged on a slip of paper tucked under a magnet in the top corner.</p><p>Her brows furrowed. The fridge was its usual chaos - Nicky's drawings in smudged crayon, a crooked construction-paper card from Mother's Day, grocery lists she hadn't looked at in weeks. She knew the landscape by heart. The note didn't belong.</p><p>"What the-" she muttered, tugging it free and skimming the words.</p><p><em>Nicky was great. You were out late, hope Rio doesn't mind :)</em></p><p>"-fuck?" she finished, narrowing her eyes like the note might rearrange itself into something more comprehensible under her glare.</p><p>Behind her, the plates rattled slightly as Rio gathered everything to bring it to the dining table. "What's that? A forgotten appointment?"</p><p>Agatha glanced over her shoulder, holding the note out for Rio to examine. "Sharon left it," she said, still confused. "Which is weird because I <em>saw</em> her last night. She could've told me... whatever this is supposed to be."</p><p>Rio's brow arched as her gaze flicked to the paper. Then, her lips parted, letting out a short laugh.</p><p>"Oh shit," she chuckled, shaking her head. "She thinks you're sneaking around behind my back."</p><p>"<em>What?</em>"</p><p>Rio nodded toward the smiley face at the end, readjusting her grip on the plates. "That's not <em>friendly babysitter</em> punctuation. That's <em>I got you</em> punctuation."</p><p>Agatha stared at her, then glanced back at the paper.</p><p>Yeah, that was a passive-aggressive smile if she'd ever seen one.</p><p>"Honestly, I'm kinda impressed," Rio added, sounding too unbothered for Agatha's taste. "She could've told you that last night, but she wrote it down and left it somewhere I could find it. Who knew our little neighbor could be so devious?"</p><p>"Rio!" Agatha growled, eyes snapping back to the woman as she shook the note. "This is serious!" She lowered her voice when the floor upstairs creaked again, reminding her they weren't alone in the house. "She thinks I'm <em>cheating on you</em>."</p><p>The words scratched her throat on their way out, stinging her tongue like poison. They hadn't even talked after entering the house last night, so Sharon couldn't have known they returned together. All she had seen was Agatha - soaking wet from the rain, starry-eyed, and without her ring.</p><p>It couldn't have looked good.</p><p>Agatha rubbed her thumb against the band on her finger. How stupid had she been? Why hadn't she put it back on before facing Sharon? The woman seemed like a harmless old lady, but Agatha <em>knew</em> she had a penchant for gossip. And that came with certain levels of observational skills.</p><p>Jesus, half the street probably already knew about it. It was only a matter of time before her mother found out, and then-</p><p>"Agatha, <em>breathe</em>," Rio's concerned voice cut through her spiral like a scalpel. The burning in her lungs registered belatedly, and she forced her throat to loosen, sucking in a shaky breath. "Good. Now another one."</p><p>Under Rio's attentive gaze, she inhaled through her nose, focusing on the sweet scents of cinnamon and butter lingering in the air. The tightness in her chest loosened after the third breath, and she straightened her spine, eyes still focused on the damned note.</p><p>Rio sighed, putting down the plate stacked with French toast to pluck the paper out of her fingers. "It doesn't matter."</p><p>"But-"</p><p>"<em>It doesn't matter</em>," Rio repeated more forcefully, crumpling up the note and stuffing it into her pocket. "She has no proof. It's just conjecture."</p><p>Agatha shook her head. "I came back late at night without my ring on. That's all the proof she needs."</p><p>Rio's eyes slid down to her left hand, snagging on the mentioned band. Her expression crumpled slightly, but she didn't comment, fiddling with her own ring.</p><p>Apparently, they had both come to the same conclusion in the morning - the night was over, and they were back to playing their parts. It shouldn't matter, but Agatha's stomach still dropped unpleasantly.</p><p>"Grounds for gossip, not proof," Rio corrected gently, finding her gaze. "Sharon can draw her own conclusions from what she saw, but it won't give your mother anything valid."</p><p>The mere mention of Evanora made Agatha's jaw jump involuntarily. A few weeks ago, she could've fooled herself into believing her mother wouldn't have found out about the mistake, but after the moves Evanora had made to throw a wrench into their marriage, she knew better. Not to mention the constant surveillance.</p><p>Agatha's eyes lit up. "The PI!"</p><p>Rio nodded, smiling as she grabbed their breakfast from the counter. "Exactly. <em>Sharon</em> may not know we were together last night, but your mother certainly does. And if she confronts us about lying or getting ready at different places, we'll say that we wanted to change things up a bit. Like we agreed."</p><p>Agatha sighed in relief, running a hand over her face. "Jesus, I can't believe I'm actually grateful that my mother's spying on us."</p><p>"Silver lining, huh?" Rio said, voice laced with dry amusement. "I'll talk to Sharon about it, though. Tell her the version we prepared for Evanora."</p><p>Agatha finally reached for the apple juice, the cool carton steadying in her hand. "I mean," she muttered, heading toward the table as Rio followed her with the plates, "crisis averted. You don't have to waste energy talking to Sharon of all people."</p><p>Rio set the food down with a flourish and dispensed the three plates to their usual places before sliding into her chair. "Maybe," she said, leaning back without looking away from Agatha. "But do you really want the babysitter - and by extension, the neighbors - to think you're sneaking around?"</p><p>"You said it didn't matter," Agatha pointed out, reaching for one of the prepared glasses to pour Nicky's juice. The kid sometimes took longer to get ready for the day than <em>she</em> did. "And I agree. They love a juicy gossip, but it's harmless."</p><p>Rio's lips curved up at the wording, but she shook her head. "No, that's not gonna fly with me. Can't have people start speculating why you'd cheat <em>down.</em>"</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. "Down?"</p><p>"Well, yeah," Rio crossed her arms, smugness radiating from every line of her body. "I'm a catch. Honestly, it's a little insulting that anyone would even think somebody <em>could</em> cheat on me."</p><p>Agatha halted her eyes mid-roll. Her first instinct was to tell Rio she was dangerously close to sounding like her own PR agent, but the words stalled.</p><p><em>Be nice</em>, she scolded herself, unlenching her jaw before it could sharpen the edge of her voice.</p><p>"I think it's less about you," she said at last, reaching for a piece of toast just to give her hands something to do, "and more about what kind of person I am."</p><p>Rio's smirk quickly sharpened into a frown. "You're not a cheater," she said without an ounce of doubt in her voice.</p><p>Something about that certainly made warmth curl in Agatha's chest. Once again, Rio made her feel seen with just one sentence. It was dangerous. It was intoxicating.</p><p>"Half the street would disagree. The other half too, but they wouldn't say it to your face," Agatha shrugged, reaching for her knife. "I think cheating is a coward's play, but it also requires a special kind of cruelty. And since most people see me as a bitch, well, it's not hard to imagine me as the villain of our perfect little marriage."</p><p>Rio's frown deepened, but Agatha shook her head before she could chime in. "I don't care for the opinions of people I barely tolerate, let alone like," she said, lifting her gaze from the toast she'd been cutting to look at the woman. "What matters is that <em>you</em> know I'd never cheat. The neighbors can go fuck themselves."</p><p>Rio stared at her for a beat, the frown still etched between her brows, though her eyes had softened. "Still, you don't deserve the label," she said quietly, almost like she couldn't understand why Agatha would let anyone believe such things. "I'll talk to Sharon. Tell her to mind her own business."</p><p>"Rio-"</p><p>"I've already decided," Rio interrupted her smoothly, her voice soft but certain. "You may not care what people think about you, but I do."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, trying for amusement. "Because of your reputation as a catch?"</p><p>"No." Rio's answer was immediate, no hesitation, no smirk to soften it. Her eyes stayed locked on Agatha's, unflinching. "Because of you. Because you deserve someone who fights on your side, even if it's just against vile rumors. I won't let people reduce you to some careless gossip when I know exactly who you are."</p><p>The words caught Agatha off guard, unexpected in their simplicity. A part of her wanted to roll her eyes, to turn the moment into another sparring match. It was safer that way, to tuck herself behind sharpness. But another part - louder, heavier - wanted to let the words sit, to bask in the fact that Rio was willing to carry the weight of her reputation like it was nothing.</p><p>She reached for the knife again, cutting too firmly into the toast just to give her hands an excuse not to shake. "We should stop having hard conversations before breakfast," she muttered. "It can't be good for digestion."</p><p>Rio's lips quirked in the faintest of smiles. "At least that way we have something to sweeten it. You know-"</p><p>"Hard conversations are better with ungodly amounts of sugar involved," Agatha finished for her, acutely aware of the heavy stomps on the stairs. For someone so small, Nicky surely knew how to make his presence known. "I know."</p><p>Before the woman could answer, Nicky barrelled into the room, wearing his newest Minecraft shirt - Agatha seriously wondered if Rio had found some underground store that sold <em>solely</em> Minecraft-related items - and a bright smile.</p><p>"Toast!" he cheered, jumping into his chair with enough force to almost topple it over. Agatha automatically reached out to steady him, sending him a warning glance, which was promptly ignored. "It still smells funny here. Are you <em>sure</em> nothing's on fire?"</p><p>The question, undoubtedly aimed at Agatha since the boy stared straight into her eyes while asking it, made Rio snicker.</p><p>"Don't blame your mom, bud," she said, sliding two pieces of toast onto his plate before serving herself. "I got distracted in the kitchen. The smell's on me."</p><p>Nicky's eyes widened at the words as he reached for his apple juice. "But you never burn things!"</p><p>"Trust me, it happens even to the best chefs," Rio laughed, glancing at Agatha before adding, "Some more than others, though."</p><p>Agatha stuffed a bite into her mouth, chewing slower than necessary to keep the biting retort buried where it belonged. The setup was perfect for something sharp, maybe a little ridiculous, that would wipe the smug grin off Rio's face. But instead, she forced herself to swallow, set her fork down, and pour herself some apple juice like she was perfectly unbothered.</p><p>It was almost painful, that act of restraint. Like holding back a sneeze.</p><p>Nicky, predictably, jumped on the train without a second thought. "That's impossible," he said firmly, as though they were discussing physics instead of breakfast. He jabbed his toast for emphasis. "Mama's the one who burns everything. Not you."</p><p>The boy's dramatic little sigh was so sincere that Agatha smiled despite herself. She quickly covered it up with a playful scoff. "I see how it is. Throw your mother under the bus at the first opportunity."</p><p>"Not <em>under</em> the bus," Nicky said quickly, already digging into his food. "Just... closer to it than Rio!"</p><p>Rio snorted into her coffee. The sound was warm, amused, and far too knowing.</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip on her fork, willing herself not to roll her eyes. Normally, she would've fired back something that would've made Nicky cackle while Rio pretended to look offended. That rhythm - <em>their</em> rhythm - was familiar, safe. But now her mind kept tripping over the world <em>girlfriend</em>, flashing like a warning sign.</p><p>So instead, she took the safest possible route: she looked down at her breakfast and cut off another bite, as if the act of eating excused her silence.</p><p>But when she dared to glance up, Rio was watching her. Not in the usual <em>I'm-about-to-get-a-laugh-out-of-you</em> way, but sharper. Curious. Like she could tell something was missing, but hadn't decided what it was yet.</p><p>Agatha immediately redirected her attention back to her son to escape the inquisitive eyes. "What's with the shirt, baby? I thought you were saving it for a special occasion."</p><p>Nicky beamed, twisting the fabric at his chest so she couldn't possibly miss the bright green creeper - Agatha resented the fact that she could <em>name</em> the creature - stamped across it. "It <em>is</em> a special occasion! We're going to the park today, remember?"</p><p>Her fork froze halfway to her mouth. The park. Right. The promise she'd made sometime between getting back from checking the scene of the date and getting ready for the night out because he wouldn't stop pouting. The promise she'd promptly forgotten in the whirlwind of everything else.</p><p>"Of course," she said quickly, forcing her voice into that calm, confident register she reserved for last-minute rescues. "The park."</p><p>Nicky, oblivious to the scramble behind her words, bounced in his seat. "I already packed my soccer ball and the frisbee! And my water bottle!" Well, that explained why he had taken an ungodly amount of time to get ready for the day. "You'll come too, right?"</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her food as he turned toward Rio with pleading eyes. "Nicky-"</p><p>"Why not?" he cut in, already buzzing with excitement. "It'll be like game day, but Rio can actually play! And you won't have to be a goalie!" He lowered his voice conspiratorially, tilting his head toward Rio. "Mama's not very good."</p><p>"Hey," Agatha said flatly, narrowing her eyes at him. "That's slander."</p><p>Rio chuckled, leaning her elbows onto the table like she'd been issued a challenge. "Goalie, huh? I'd pay to see that."</p><p>Agatha's jaw tightened, the retort right there on her tongue. But with Rio watching her - <em>really</em> watching her - she forced her lips into something that might pass as a smile. "I think you're better-suited for the job," she said tightly before her eyes slid back to her son. "And you - don't rope people into things without asking first."</p><p>"But I <em>did</em> ask," Nicky argued, crumbs flying as he pointed his fork at Rio. "And she said yes."</p><p>Rio didn't correct him. If anything, she tilted her head toward Agatha like she was watching her choose whether to call him out or let it slide.</p><p>It was a lost battle. If Agatha tried arguing, she might sound like she didn't <em>want</em> Rio at the park with them, and it certainly wouldn't have looked good in her girlfriend's eyes. She could try subtly hinting that it was a <em>public</em> park, and they'd need to act like a married couple, which would be hard considering Nicky's presence, but it felt regressive. Like grasping for the logic she'd been using for months to keep them from building anything real.</p><p>"Great. The more, the merrier," she finally said, words clipped but steady.</p><p>Nicky cheered, nearly toppling his chair again. "This is gonna be the best park day <em>ever</em>!"</p>
