But somehow, she doesn’t.</p><p>Now she’s fake dating the most irritating woman alive, their friends are watching like it’s a spectator sport, and the walls between their apartments are very thin.</p><p>It’s fine. It’s fake. It’s strictly platonic.</p><p>…So why is Agatha’s stomach flipping every time Rio looks at her like that?</p><p>Or: Agatha insists she's straight, Rio insists on being a menace, and everyone else insists that there's a "vibe".</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness adjusted the strap of her handbag and plastered on her most professional smile as she unlocked the door to her apartment. Behind her, three colleagues followed, each so neatly put-together that her modest living room suddenly felt too small for all their tailored suits and gleaming shoes.</p><p>Before she could step inside, the sound of a spoon clinking against a bowl froze her in place. She knew that sound. It was the sound of betrayal.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she entered her apartment and rounded the corner to the kitchen. There, in all her smug glory, was Rio Vidal. She was bent over the counter, wearing Agatha’s plaid pyjama pants and an oversized sweatshirt—also Agatha’s. A bowl of chocolate fudge ice cream sat snugly in her left hand, half-devoured, the spoon dangling from her mouth as she rifled through a drawer.</p><p>Agatha had long considered herself a woman of composure, but this? This was testing her limits.</p><p>“<em>What the hell are you doing?</em>” Agatha hissed, keeping her voice low to avoid alerting her colleagues.</p><p>Rio’s brown eyes flicked up to meet Agatha’s, her lips curling around the spoon in her mouth into an infuriatingly casual smile as she mumbled, “Oh, hey! You’re back.” She tugged the spoon from her mouth and waved it lazily. “I’m looking for my vegetable peeler. You borrowed it weeks ago, remember?”</p><p>“Now?” Agatha’s voice pitched higher. She darted a glance toward the living room, where the muffled sounds of polite conversation continued. “You decided to break into my apartment <em>now</em>?”</p><p>“Technically, your spare key was under the mat. That’s <em>practically</em> an invitation,” Rio said, taking another leisurely bite of ice cream.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into fists. “And the pyjamas?”</p><p>Rio looked down at herself, then shrugged. “Mine were in the wash, and these are comfy. You have good taste, by the way. Oh, also,” she gestured down to her bowl with the spoon, “you’re out of chocolate fudge.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw almost dropped at the young girls audacity. She opened her mouth to fire back but was cut off by the sound of footsteps. One of her colleagues, Lilia, appeared in the doorway, her eyebrows shooting up at the sight of Rio.</p><p>“Oh, uh, I didn’t realise you had company, Agatha,” Lilia said, her gaze flicked between Agatha and Rio, curiosity written all over her face.</p><p>“I don’t,” Agatha said quickly, her cheeks burning. “Rio was just leaving.”</p><p>Rio, unbothered as ever, slid the drawer closed slowly with the ice cream still in hand. “Actually, I was just helping myself to a snack. Don’t mind me.”</p><p>“I do mind you,” Agatha snapped.</p><p>“Is she your... roommate?” Lilia asked, her tone far too amused for Agatha’s liking.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said firmly. “She’s my <em>neighbour.</em>”</p><p>“Best neighbour you’ll ever have,” Rio added with a wink, earning an amused look from Lilia.</p><p>Agatha’s glare could have set the ice cream on fire. She grabbed Rio by the arm and dragged her toward the door. “Out. Now.”</p><p>“Okay, okay. No need to be so uptight,” Rio said, though she didn’t seem remotely remorseful. As Agatha shoved her out into the hallway, Rio leaned back in with a grin, the bowl of ice cream still in her hand, “let me know when you find my peeler.”</p><p>The door slammed shut, cutting off Rio’s laughter. Agatha let out a sharp breath, tugged at her blazer, and turned back to her colleagues, trying to hold onto the last thread of composure.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” she said, voice tight but steady. “Shall we get started?”</p><p>Lilia smirked, eyes gleaming with mischief. “Your neighbour seems… fun.”</p><p>Agatha bit back a groan and slapped on another too-bright professional smile, teeth clenched.</p><p align="center">
<strong>***</strong>
</p><p>Back in the living room, Lilia had already claimed the center of the couch, lounging with one leg tucked beneath her as if she owned the place. Jen was perched on the edge of the armchair, scrolling through her phone with the focus of someone plotting world domination, and Sharon had claimed a dining chair and dragged it closer to the coffee table, already sitting up straight with her notebook open like she was bracing for a board meeting.</p><p>Agatha sighed inwardly, knowing this was going to haunt her for weeks.</p><p>"Can I get anyone something to drink? Tea? Coffee?"</p><p>"Got wine?" Lilia asked, grinning like she already knew the answer.</p><p>Agatha gave her a flat look. "It’s two in the afternoon."</p><p>"And?" Lilia raised an eyebrow. "We’re not in a boardroom. Lighten up, Harkness. I’ll take red, if you’ve got it."</p><p>"I’ll pass," Jen mumbled, still staring at her phone. "But I’ll take tea. Something calming."<br/>She glanced up, gave Agatha a once-over, then added, "If you’ve got anything in that category."</p><p>Agatha said nothing, choosing to ignore the thinly veiled jab, and turned to Sharon instead.</p><p>Sharon just smiled politely. "Tea would be lovely, thank you."</p><p>"Right," Agatha muttered, retreating to the kitchen. She grabbed mugs, filled the kettle, and—after a short internal war—yanked the wine bottle off the rack.</p><p>From the living room, Lilia’s voice carried through. "So, what’s the story with the neighbour?"</p><p>"Please don’t encourage this," Agatha called back, busying herself with the kettle.</p><p>"Oh, come on, Agatha," Lilia pressed. "She’s clearly into you."</p><p>"She’s not," Agatha said, re-entering the room with the tea tray and bottle of wine. She placed them on the table and began pouring, ignoring Lilia’s skeptical snort.</p><p>Lilia wasn’t about to let it go, not when she smelled blood in the water. She leaned back, swirling her wine like a soap opera villain.</p><p>"Oh, come on, Agatha. She was wearing your pyjamas, raiding your ice cream stash, and making herself at home in your kitchen. If that’s not a vibe, I don’t know what is."</p><p>Agatha set the teapot down with a little more force than necessary. "There is no vibe, Lilia. She’s just an obnoxious neighbour who doesn’t respect personal space."</p><p>"Obnoxious or not, she’s cute," Jen said without looking up from her phone.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms tightly. "She’s not my type."</p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow. "So, you have a type? Do enlighten us."</p><p>Sharon gave a soft chuckle into her teacup, saying nothing, but Agatha could tell she was quietly amused.</p><p>Agatha groaned. "Fine. If you must know, I’m straight. And even if I wasn’t, Rio is at least ten years younger than me. I would never go there."</p><p>The room fell silent for a beat, and Agatha thought, for a fleeting moment, she might have shut them up.</p><p>But then Lilia burst into laughter—a full, belly-deep laugh that made Jen finally glance up, smirking.</p><p>"Straight? Really, Agatha?" Lilia said, wiping a tear from her eye. "You? Oh, that’s rich."</p><p>"I <em>am</em> straight," Agatha insisted, her tone dangerously close to defensive. "And I have absolutely no interest in Rio. End of discussion."</p><p>"Oh, sure," Lilia drawled, raising her glass in a mock toast. "No interest at all in the hot younger neighbour who breaks into your apartment, steals your ice cream, and wears your pyjamas. You can say that, but I still think there's a vibe. Or maybe a fantasy."</p><p>"Maybe both," Jen muttered, her eyes returning to her phone.</p><p>Agatha scowled and threw her hands in the air. "Enough, both of you. Can we please focus on the proposal?"</p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes and took a swig of her wine, but Sharon gave her a sympathetic smile.</p><p>"Fine, fine," Lilia said, still chuckling as she set her glass down. "But don’t think this conversation is over."</p><p>"Oh, it absolutely is," Agatha muttered, pulling out her laptop and determinedly opening the presentation.</p><p>As the others settled into work mode, she tried to ignore the lingering smirks—and the tiny, traitorous part of her brain that wondered if Lilia might have a point. <em>Absolutely not.</em> </p><p>Agatha clicked through the slides on her laptop, her voice steady as she walked her colleagues through the finer points of the proposal. On the surface, she appeared calm, collected, and entirely in control. But beneath the surface, her thoughts churned like a stormy sea.</p><p><em>Straight</em>, she reaffirmed internally, repeating it like a mantra as she adjusted the presentation screen.</p><p>Just because Lilia had a flair for making everything sound like a romantic comedy plotline didn’t mean there was any truth to it. Agatha had dated men. <em>Married</em> one, for god's sake. Sure, she hadn't really dated since the divorce, but that didn't mean anything.</p><p>She was just <em>busy</em>.</p><p>She was <em>focused</em>.</p><p>She was <em>straight</em>.</p><p>She was...</p><p>Her mind flitted briefly to her upcoming date tomorrow night—the one she had almost forgotten she had agreed to. A handsome man—smart, charming, her age. It was promising. She even liked the way he held doors open without making it feel patronising. <em>That</em> had to count for something.</p><p>But then, hadn’t the last couple of rare dates also seemed promising? Each one had started with the same cocktail of hope and cautious optimism, only to fizzle out when things inevitably fell flat. <em>Too clingy. Too detached. Too obsessed with cryptocurrency. Why do they all talk about cryptocurrency?</em></p><p>Agatha clicked to the next slide, forcing herself to focus on Lilia’s questions about the budget.</p><p>"We can repurpose some of the existing resources," she said evenly, highlighting the section in question. "It’s all outlined here."</p><p>Lilia nodded along, but her smirk hadn’t entirely faded.</p><p>Agatha pretended not to notice and continued.</p><p><em>It’s not that I’m picky</em>, she thought defensively. <em>I just have standards. Reasonable ones. And tomorrow’s date will go better. He’s nice. Normal. Predictable. A grown-up.</em></p><p>Her fingers hovered over the trackpad as another, unwelcome thought bubbled to the surface.</p><p>
<em>Unlike Rio.</em>
</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, willing her mind to let it go. She wasn’t going to entertain that absurdity, not after Lilia’s teasing.</p><p>So what if Rio had a certain… <em>charm</em>?</p><p>A reckless, infuriating charm that made her want to throttle her one second and maybe... <em>No.</em></p><p>
<em>Absolutely not.</em>
</p><p>Rio was young, careless, and entirely too pleased with herself. She wasn’t even in the running.</p><p>"Agatha, are you listening?"</p><p>Jen’s voice cut through her inner spiral. Agatha blinked, realising Lilia was watching her with a knowing expression.</p><p>"Of course," she replied briskly, gesturing to the chart on the screen. "As I was saying, the projections show…"</p><p>Her voice carried on, but her thoughts had already rebelled.</p><p>She told herself it was because Lilia’s ribbing had gotten under her skin, <em>not</em> because Rio’s grin and her smug, comfortable presence in Agatha’s kitchen had left an impression.</p><p><em>Not</em> because Rio made her laugh—no, <em>smirk</em>. Briefly. Begrudgingly.</p><p>
<em>Straight. Straight as an arrow.</em>
</p><p>And tomorrow’s date was going to be perfect.</p><p>At least, she <em>hoped</em> so.</p><p align="center">
<strong>***</strong>
</p><p>The restaurant buzzed with soft conversation and the clinking of silverware. Agatha sat across from Ralph Bohner, a man who, by all accounts, was perfect on paper. Tall, well-dressed, with a friendly smile that hovered somewhere between charming and wholesome. He spoke with ease, regaling her with stories about his work as a structural engineer and his recent hiking trip to the Adirondacks.</p><p>Agatha listened attentively, nodding and offering the occasional laugh at the right moments. Ralph was everything she had told herself she wanted. A grown-up. Normal. Predictable. Not a single ounce of chaos.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>She swirled the last of her wine in the glass, trying to pinpoint the emptiness that sat stubbornly in her chest. Ralph was handsome. Smart. <em>Sweet, even</em>. But every time he smiled at her, she felt... nothing. No spark. No warmth. Just the faint itch of polite obligation.</p><p>"And that's when I realised I’d been reading the map upside down the whole time," Ralph finished with a chuckle, his brown eyes crinkling at the corners.</p><p>Agatha forced a laugh, setting down her glass. "That sounds like quite the adventure."</p><p>"It was," he said, leaning forward slightly. "But enough about me. What about you? Any big plans for the weekend?"</p><p>"Oh, nothing exciting," she said, fiddling with the napkin in her lap. "Just work, mostly."</p><p>Ralph nodded, his gaze lingering on her face. "You’re really something, Agatha. Smart, successful, gorgeous. I feel like I hit the jackpot just being here tonight."</p><p>The compliment landed as it should—flattering, sincere—but all Agatha could muster was a tight smile. "That’s kind of you to say."</p><p>The evening wrapped up soon after, with Ralph insisting on walking her back to her apartment.</p><p>The chill of the evening air nipped at Agatha’s cheeks as they strolled down the quiet street. Ralph’s easy conversation filled the silence, but her thoughts were elsewhere. She knew she should feel something—anything—for him. He was everything she claimed to want. So why did it feel like she was trying to jam a puzzle piece into the wrong space?</p><p>"This is me," she said, stopping in front of her building and fishing for her keys. "Thank you for tonight, Ralph. It was... nice."</p><p>"Nice?" Ralph teased with a grin. "I’ll take it."</p><p>Before she could offer an apologetic smile, the sound of footsteps made her stiffen. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was.</p><p>"Well, well," Rio’s voice drawled, dripping with mischief. "Who’s this?"</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth, silently willing the ground to swallow her whole. She turned to find Rio standing in her plaid pyjamas again, hands shoved casually into the pockets of her jacket. Only Rio would be standing outside their apartment building in pyjamas. Rio’s gaze flicked between Agatha and Ralph, a smirk curling her lips.</p><p>"Uh, Ralph," he said, holding out a hand. "Ralph Bohner."</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up, and Agatha could see the joke forming before it even left her mouth. See? Immature.</p><p>"Bohner?" Rio repeated, her smirk widening. "As in—?"</p><p>"Yes, that’s my last name," Ralph cut in good-naturedly. "Heard it all before."</p><p>"I bet you have," Rio said with a chuckle as she shook his offered hand. "I’m Rio, by the way. Agatha’s best neighbour ever."</p><p>"Ah," Ralph said, clearly unsure how to respond to Rio’s energy. He turned back to Agatha, his expression softening. "Well, I had a great time tonight. Maybe we can do this again?"</p><p>Agatha forced a smile, her stomach twisting. "Maybe."</p><p>Ralph leaned in, brushing a polite kiss to her cheek before waving to Rio and heading down the street.</p><p>As soon as he disappeared around the corner, Agatha let out a long breath. Her chest felt heavy, her mind racing. She should have felt something, she told herself. Ralph was perfect. Kind, thoughtful, handsome. But her heart had stubbornly refused to cooperate.</p><p>"<em>Bohner</em>," Rio said, breaking into her thoughts. She snorted, leaning against the side of the building. "You sure know how to pick em."</p><p>"Goodnight, Rio," Agatha said, her tone clipped as she pushed through the entrance doors.</p><p>Agatha barely made it two steps into the lobby when Rio darted in behind her, letting the door swing shut with an obnoxious clang. Agatha stopped, her shoulders tensing as she turned to face the relentless woman.</p><p>"Why are you following me?" she asked, her voice strained.</p><p>"Following you? Please," Rio said, flashing her a grin. "I live here too, remember? Just happened to be out for some fresh air when you returned from your very... eventful date."</p><p>"Eventful?" Agatha echoed, exasperated. "He walked me home. That’s it."</p><p>"Sure, but his name was Bohner," Rio said, drawing out the syllables as though savouring them. "I mean, come on, Aggie. That’s comedy gold."</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. "It’s not Aggie, and I don’t have the energy for this tonight."</p><p>Rio’s grin only widened as she trailed behind Agatha toward the stairs. Agatha had hoped that the stairs would deter her from following, but of course they didn't. "What’s wrong? Bohner not the one? Or did I scare him off?"</p><p>"He’s perfectly fine," Agatha said, her steps brisk as she climbed the stairs. "Handsome, smart, polite. Everything a woman could want."</p><p>"Except for you, apparently," Rio said, easily keeping pace. "Don’t tell me you’re one of those people who self-sabotage when things get too boring."</p><p>Agatha stopped abruptly on the landing, spinning to glare at Rio. "What is your point?"</p><p>Rio raised her hands in mock surrender, her expression frustratingly amused. "No point. Just making conversation. You looked like you could use a distraction."</p><p>"A distraction?" Agatha echoed, her voice sharp. "You’re always a distraction."</p><p>Rio smirked, pressing her tongue into the inside of her cheek, eyes glinting.<br/>"You’re welcome."</p><p>Agatha groaned, turning back toward her apartment door. She fumbled for her keys, already dreaming of the peace and quiet that awaited her inside. The key had barely turned in the lock when she felt Rio step closer, the warmth of her presence brushing against her back.</p><p>"And for the record," Rio said, her voice dropping to a teasing lilt, "if you’re into older guys with unfortunate last names, you could at least warn me before I meet them. I need prep time."</p><p>Agatha shoved the door open and stepped inside, her jaw clenched. "Goodnight, Rio."</p><p>Before she could close the door, Rio caught it with her foot and slipped inside like she owned the place.</p><p>"Oh no, you’re not getting rid of me that easily," Rio said, sauntering toward the kitchen and rummaging through a cabinet as if she lived there. "You owe me an explanation for why you keep dating guys who put you to sleep."</p><p>Agatha gaped at her. "I don’t owe you anything, least of all a play-by-play of my love life."</p><p>“Love life?” Rio snorted, pulling out a box of crackers and waving it at her. “Please. That wasn’t love, Aggs, that was two people pretending dinner counts as intimacy."</p><p>"Out," Agatha snapped, pointing toward the door.</p><p>Rio smirked, leaning casually against the counter as she popped a cracker into her mouth. "You’re so uptight. You should thank me for making your night more interesting."</p><p>Agatha grabbed the box from her hands, her patience finally snapping. "Rio. Get. Out."</p><p>"Fine," Rio said, holding up her hands in surrender again. "But just so you know, you could do better. Bohner’s not your type."</p><p>"And what, you think you know my type?" Agatha demanded, her patience thin.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. Instead, she tilted her head, her smirk softening into something almost serious. "Maybe. Maybe not. But I know it’s not him."</p><p>The intensity in Rio’s gaze made Agatha’s stomach flip, and she hated how disarmed she felt. Before she could formulate a response, Rio turned and strolled toward the door, her usual swagger firmly back in place.</p><p>"Sleep tight, Aggie," Rio called over her shoulder as she slipped out.</p><p>Agatha locked the door behind her with more force than necessary, leaning against it with a frustrated sigh. She knew Rio was right. Bohner was not her type. No matter how badly she wanted him to be.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha sat at her desk at the consulting firm, staring at the stack of reports she hadn’t touched since lunch. Her inbox was full. Her calendar was worse. Another day of chasing clients who didn’t reply, rewriting briefs that didn’t need rewriting, and sitting through meetings that could’ve been emails.</p><p>Her phone buzzed—an email from Lilia.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> <em>Next time, more enthusiasm.</em></p><p>Agatha didn’t even open it. She just let out a short laugh and leaned back in her chair. It was the third jab this week. Maybe fourth. Jen had left a dozen comments on yesterday’s report, all vague and passive.</p><p>Sharon had forwarded some client feedback that morning with a note that read <em>“worth keeping in mind going forward,”</em> which somehow made Agatha want to launch her monitor out the window.</p><p>Everything felt pointless. No matter how hard she worked, it wasn’t enough. And she was tired in a way that sleep didn’t fix.</p><p>Ralph had been the high point of her week. Which said... a lot. A dinner that left her cold, a goodnight kiss she didn’t feel, and a polite text she never responded to.</p><p>Maybe it wasn’t the job. Maybe it wasn’t them.</p><p>“Maybe it’s me,” she muttered, snapping her laptop shut like it might stop her from thinking.</p><p>A soft knock came before Lilia pushed her office door open and leaned against the frame, her usual smirk in place.</p><p>“God, you look like shit,” she said cheerfully. “Rough day?”</p><p>“You could say that.”</p><p>“Well, perfect. We’re going out.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Out?”</p><p>“Drinks. Dancing. It's Friday and you <em>clearly</em> need a reset.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head and turned back to tidying the papers on her desk, mostly to avoid making eye contact. “I don’t dance.”</p><p>Jen appeared next, adjusting the sleeves of her pastel blazer like she was about to step into a TED talk. “You don’t have to dance. You just have to come. Sharon’s already in.”</p><p>“I have work—”</p><p>Sharon stepped in last, as if summoned by name, holding a cup of herbal tea and wearing that unsettlingly serene smile. “You’re coming,” she said gently. “We’ve decided.”</p><p>Agatha stared at them. She didn’t have the energy to argue.</p><p>“Seven o’clock,” Lilia said, already halfway back into the hallway. “And wear something that doesn’t scream <em>I do my taxes for fun.</em>”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Just sat there, watching the door slowly swing shut behind them.</p><p>And that’s how she ended up here, tugging at the hem of her plum coloured blouse, feeling out of place as she followed her colleagues into a trendy downtown bar. The space was loud, packed with people, and pulsing with music. Lilia had already disappeared toward the bar to order drinks, while Sharon and Jen scoped out a table near the back.</p><p>“This is not my scene,” Agatha muttered, trailing behind them. She didn’t think it was any of their scene.</p><p>Jen turned to her with a smirk. “Oh, come on, Agatha, you need to loosen up. Get your mind off work for once.”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha said dryly, glancing around at the crowd. She was pretty sure this place had more <em>hipster</em> vibes than she could handle, but the last thing she wanted was to feel like the office oddball.</p><p>As they found their seats, Agatha sat down with a sigh, scanning the room, trying to ignore the familiar feeling of discomfort settling in. She was already trying to decide how much longer she would have to stay when Lilia reappeared with a round of drinks.</p><p>“There you go, darling,” Lilia said, sliding a gin and tonic toward Agatha. “This should help.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha said with a weak smile. She picked it up, grateful for the distraction. After a sip, she forced a laugh at something Sharon was saying, but it wasn’t long before her drink was empty and she needed a break from the group. She excused herself and made her way toward the bar.</p><p>The bar was even louder up close, with groups of people spilling out into the space around it. Agatha stood at the counter, trying to catch the bartender’s eye. She shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other, feeling self-conscious in her blouse and pencil skirt, wondering if she was overdressed or underdressed for this kind of night. Maybe she should have taken Lilia’s advice and gone more casual.</p><p>A voice cut through the noise. “Hey, beautiful. What’s your name?”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped as she turned to find a guy leaning against the bar next to her. He had that kind of smirk on his face that immediately made her uncomfortable, like he thought he knew everything about her with one glance. His eyes traced her up and down with too much familiarity and she bristled.</p><p>She took a step back, clutching the edge of the bar tighter. “Uh… not interested,” she muttered, trying to sidestep him.</p><p>“Oh, come on, don’t be like that, sweetheart. I can buy you a drink—”</p><p>She was about to shoot him down again when, out of nowhere, she felt a presence beside her. A hand casually slid around her waist, pulling her closer and her body tensed, instinctively bracing for whatever was coming next. She opened her mouth to protest, but before she could say anything, the person leaned in, speaking in a low voice.</p><p>“She said she wasn’t interested,” came the smooth, firm voice.</p><p>Agatha froze, her head snapping to the woman attached to her, her heart beating faster as she realised who it was.</p><p>
<em>Rio.</em>
</p><p>Rio’s arm was around her waist, the contact so natural, like it was something she had every right to do. The guy at the bar blinked, clearly taken aback by the sudden intervention, but he didn’t back down.</p><p>“Probably don’t even know each other,” he muttered, his gaze shifting between them with a doubtful smirk. “Girls do this all the time. Pretend to be with someone just to get rid of guys.”</p><p>Agatha could feel her heart racing, a mix of surprise and something else she couldn’t quite place. She was about to open her mouth to tell this guy off, but before she could, Rio’s grip tightened slightly, pulling her even closer and Agatha hated the way her breath stuttered.</p><p>“You’re wrong,” Rio said, her voice laced with calm but undeniable authority. “She’s not interested, and <em>I am</em> her girlfriend. So why don’t you take your drink and find someone else to bother?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, her eyes wide. She had never seen Rio like this before—so confident, so assertive. It was as if she had flipped a switch, becoming someone entirely different from the playful, easy-going, <em>annoying </em>neighbour she thought she knew. There was no hesitation in her words, no room for argument. Rio was firmly in control of the situation and Agatha felt her face heat up.</p><p>The guy looked between the two of them, his expression faltering, before he muttered something under his breath. He looked at Agatha one last time, clearly not willing to challenge Rio any further, and walked away.</p><p>Agatha was left standing there, completely speechless. She hadn’t expected Rio to step in like that, to act as if she owned the situation, and her chest tightened at the thought. Rio, her neighbour, who was so carefree and annoyingly charming one minute, had just acted like someone who would defend her,<em> possessively </em>almost.</p><p>“You…” Agatha started, unsure how to finish the sentence. “You really just did that.”</p><p>Rio shifted back just enough to let her arm slide off Agatha’s waist, but she didn’t go far. She tilted her head slightly, tongue pressing into the inside of her cheek as she gave Agatha a once-over—like she was sizing her up and enjoying the view.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said, voice low and dry. “Guess I’ve got a soft spot for women who look like they’re two seconds from throat-punching someone.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. The guy was gone, but she could still feel the tension he left behind—only now it had morphed into something else entirely. Heavier. Closer. The air between her and Rio felt charged in a way that made it hard to think clearly.</p><p>And somehow, she wasn’t uncomfortable.</p><p>She felt... relieved.</p><p>Maybe it was because Rio had stepped in. Or maybe it was the way she’d done it—casual, quiet, a hand at her waist like it belonged there. Like Agatha wasn’t just being helped, but claimed.</p><p>“Thanks,” she muttered finally, unsure why the word felt so small.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You’re welcome.” Her voice dipped lower as she leaned in again, just enough. “But you owe me.”</p><p>That pulled Agatha right out of whatever daze she’d been stuck in.</p><p>She straightened, cleared her throat. “Owe you?” she repeated, rolling her eyes. “What, for stepping in uninvited? Don’t act like I asked.”</p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She just smirked, shifting her weight lazily like she had all night. “You looked at him like you weren’t sure whether to run or set him on fire. I chose the option with fewer witnesses.”</p><p>Agatha snorted before she could stop herself, then immediately tried to bury it. “I can handle myself.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said.</p><p>Of course she did. She always did. Always just that little bit ahead—smug, infuriating, probably enjoying this.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. She could tell Rio wasn’t taking her seriously, and honestly? Fine. She wasn’t sure she even meant what she’d said. That whole moment—whatever it was—had thrown her off.</p><p>Her stomach still hadn’t settled. That fluttery feeling was still hanging around, completely uninvited.</p><p>She glanced over.</p><p>Rio was at the bar now, one hand resting on the edge, chatting with the bartender like she’d been here a hundred times. The jacket she was wearing was new—black, fitted, unfair. Her jeans looked expensive in that subtle, lived-in way. And the boots were... a choice.</p><p>It wasn’t the Rio she was used to. No messy hair. No old sweatshirt. None of that casual, half-distracted energy.</p><p>This was... put-together. Intentional. Sharp.</p><p>And hot.</p><p>Agatha stared a second too long.</p><p>Then she caught herself and looked away fast, shaking her head like that would clear it.</p><p>No. Nope.</p><p>Rio was <em>not</em> hot.</p><p>“What are you even doing here?” she asked, her voice a little sharper than she meant. “I didn’t know you frequented to bars.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, matching Agatha's tone with a slight smirk. “I could ask you the same thing,” she shot back, her voice dripping with amusement.</p><p>Agatha blinked, surprised. “What, you think I don’t belong here?” she shot back, a little defensive, but Rio’s playful challenge only made her feel more out of place.</p><p>“I didn’t say that” Rio teased, her smirk widening as she leaned casually against the bar. “I just didn’t take you for the bar type. But I guess you can surprise me every now and then.”</p><p>She leaned in a little closer to Agatha, her eyes twinkling with something that she couldn’t quite figure out. Agatha narrowed her eyes, her pulse quickening at the way Rio leaned into her space like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>“Well, I’m not here for the ambiance—I’m here because my coworkers practically dragged me.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her smirk never faltering. “That explains why you’re clinging to the bar like it’s a life raft.” She gestured toward the rest of the group, now laughing and chatting at a table across the room. “You don’t seem like the mingling type.”</p><p>Agatha bristled, her pride prickling. “I can mingle just fine, thank you.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Rio said, unconvinced. She took a sip from her drink, her eyes sparkling with that maddening mix of challenge and amusement. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her retort caught in her throat as Rio shifted her stance, drawing Agatha’s attention again. She had to admit—reluctantly—that Rio looked... good tonight. Not <em>hot.</em> <em>Just… good. </em></p><p>It was unfair, really, how effortlessly Rio could command a room, even one as loud and chaotic as this bar. Agatha’s gaze flicked to Rio’s face, catching the raised eyebrow Rio shot back at her, clearly catching her staring.</p><p>Agatha scowled. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said, though her grin suggested otherwise. She set her drink down on the bar, shifting her full attention to Agatha. “So, if you’re not here for the ambiance and clearly not for the mingling, why did you let them drag you here?”</p><p>Agatha huffed, crossing her arms. “To avoid feeling like a social outcast when Lilia and Jen gossip about how boring I am on Monday.”</p><p>Rio let out a low chuckle. “Ah, workplace peer pressure. Say no more.” She leaned her elbow on the bar, her expression softening slightly. Rio swirled her drink absently, her gaze flickering to the bustling crowd before landing back on Agatha. “Speaking of workplace dynamics,” she started slowly, her tone suddenly casual but with a faint undertone of annoyance, “I’ve got this work Christmas party in two weeks.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “And? Don’t tell me you’re one of those people who actually likes holiday parties.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Not even close. But this one’s mandatory, and…” She hesitated, a rare flicker of discomfort crossing her face. “There’s this colleague of mine. Let’s just say they’re a bit too touchy for my liking.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, surprised by the admission. It wasn’t often that Rio let her guard down, even slightly. “Touchy how?” she asked, her voice softening despite herself, her focus zeroing in on Rio.</p><p>“You know,” Rio said, waving a hand vaguely, “the kind of person who doesn’t seem to understand personal space. Always leaning in too close, brushing against you when it’s completely unnecessary, that sort of thing.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, her annoyance at Rio momentarily forgotten. “That sounds... awful. Have you said anything to them?”</p><p>“I’ve tried,” Rio said, her tone turning wry. “But they just laugh it off, like I’m joking or being overly sensitive. It’s honestly exhausting.”</p><p>Agatha studied Rio’s face, noting the way her usual confidence seemed tempered by frustration. It was strange to see her like this—vulnerable, in a way that felt almost... human. Huh, who knew she had that capability.</p><p>“So what are you going to do?” Agatha asked, genuinely curious, stepping closer to hear her more clearly over the bar’s noise.</p><p>Rio glanced at her, a mischievous glint returning to her eyes. “Well, I was thinking of bringing someone along. You know, as a ‘hands-off’ warning sign.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Like a human shield?”</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio said, grinning now. “Someone who can handle themselves, keep things light, and make it crystal clear that I’m not available for unsolicited contact.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “And have you found your lucky human shield yet?”</p><p>Rio leaned closer, her fingers reaching out to gently play Agatha’s blouse just above her hip, her grin widening. “Not yet. But I might have a candidate in mind.”</p><p>Agatha froze, realising where this was going. “Oh, no,” she said quickly, holding up her hands and taking a small step back, Rio’s hand dropping back to her side. “Don’t even think about it.”</p><p>“Why not?” Rio said, feigning innocence. “You’d be perfect. You’re sharp, quick-witted, <em>and hot</em>. Triple threat. I’d need to make it believable.”</p><p>Agatha's mouth opened, then closed, completely caught off guard by the unexpected compliment buried in Rio’s teasing tone. Her face heated up despite herself, and she quickly crossed her arms to regain some semblance of control.</p><p>“I’m not your ‘perfect’ anything,” she retorted, narrowing her eyes. “Find someone else to play pretend with.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her smirk deepening. “Oh, come on. After tonight? You kind of owe me.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and she threw her head back dramatically.</p><p>Rio’s grin turned positively smug. “If it weren’t for me, who knows how long he would’ve kept pestering you…”</p><p>Agatha scowled. “I had it handled.”</p><p>“Sure you did,” Rio said, her tone dripping with mock agreement. “Because looking like a deer caught in headlights is totally an effective defence strategy.”</p><p>“I was not—” Agatha started to snap, but then stopped herself, biting back the retort. She exhaled slowly through her nose, glaring at Rio. “You’re very irritating.”</p><p>“I’m just offering you a chance to repay the favour,” Rio said, her expression the picture of innocence, though the mischievous sparkle in her eyes betrayed her true intentions.</p><p>Agatha huffed, turning away from Rio as if she could physically escape the conversation. “This is ridiculous,” she muttered, more to herself than to Rio.</p><p>“Think of it this way,” Rio continued, leaning her elbow against the bar as she watched Agatha with infuriating amusement. “You’d be helping me out, <em>and </em>you’d get to make some awkward work party at least mildly entertaining.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a sidelong glance. “Entertaining how? I’m finding it hard to find anything that is beneficial for me in this ‘<em>arrangement</em>’.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her grin softening into something more genuine. “Well, I’m sure we could come up with a few ways to keep it interesting <em>and</em> to make sure there’s something in it for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach flipped, but she set her jaw, forcing her expression into something unimpressed. If Rio noticed anything, she didn’t show it. She rolled her eyes instead, shaking her head. “You are unbelievable. My condition is that you stop breaking into my apartment.”</p><p>“Unbelievably charming, maybe,” Rio quipped, earning herself a sharp look from Agatha as she avoided Agatha’s condition.</p><p>“You’re lucky I don’t smack that smirk right off your face,” Agatha muttered, though there was no real heat behind her words.</p><p>Rio straightened, holding her hands up in mock surrender. “Alright, alright. No pressure. Just... think about it.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her. She should have said no. Instead, she said nothing at all.</p><p>Agatha shook her head and took a deliberate step back, trying to create some distance—both physical and mental—from Rio’s overwhelming presence. She could feel her colleagues’ gazes burning into her from across the bar and realised how long she’d been gone. If she didn’t return soon, they would undoubtedly spin this into a Monday morning story she didn’t need.</p><p>“I should get back to my group before they think I ditched them,” she said, her tone brisk.</p><p>“Good idea,” Rio said with a teasing lilt, as though she made it clear she didn’t believe Agatha wanted to leave at all.</p><p>Agatha turned to go, but Rio’s voice stopped her in her tracks. “See you at home later, Aggie.”</p><p>Agatha froze for a fraction of a second before glancing back over her shoulder. Rio stood there, grinning in that infuriating way she always did, like she had the upper hand in a game Agatha wasn’t even sure she was playing.</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes and turned back towards her colleagues.</p><p>Agatha navigated her way through the crowd, the noise and bustle of the bar doing little to drown out the lingering warmth of Rio’s words. <em>God, that woman was annoying.</em></p><p>When Agatha reached her table, she was immediately met with Lilia’s smirk. The woman didn’t say anything at first, just sipped her drink, her eyes sparkling with amusement.</p><p>Jen, however, wasn’t as subtle. She leaned forward with a grin. “Wasn’t that your nosy neighbour? The one we met last week? You know, the one who looked <em>entirely</em> too comfortable in your apartment?”</p><p>Agatha set her empty glass she was fiddling with, <em>all that time at the bar and she didn’t get another drink,</em> down with more force than necessary, ignoring the sudden heat creeping up her neck. “She wasn’t comfortable,” Agatha said quickly, too quickly. “She was just… there.”</p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow, her smirk widening. “Oh, she was definitely comfortable.”</p><p>Agatha glared at them, feeling her patience thin. “Can we not do this right now? She’s just… Rio. She’s always around because she doesn’t have boundaries, not because there’s anything going on.”</p><p>Jen snorted into her drink. “Sure, nothing’s going on. That’s why she was standing so close to you just now. I’m sure that was completely platonic.”</p><p>Lilia leaned her chin on her hand, looking entirely too entertained. “She did seem pretty invested. If I didn’t know better, I’d think she was staking a claim or something.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, burying her face in her hands. “I hate all of you.”</p><p>“Love you too,” Jen said brightly, clinking her glass with Lilia’s.</p><p>The conversation mercifully shifted after that, but Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched—or the knowing looks Lilia occasionally threw her way. She distracted herself by eating the ice from her glass and nodding along to whatever Sharon was saying.</p><p align="center">
<strong>***</strong>
</p><p>Agatha found herself fumbling with her keys at her apartment door a little after midnight. The buzz from the drinks she’d had with her colleagues made her clumsier than usual. She muttered a curse under her breath as she missed the lock for the third time, leaning heavily against the doorframe for balance.</p><p>The distant ding of the elevator caught her attention. She glanced over, squinting in the dim hallway lighting, and her stomach dropped, and she had to sudden urge to vomit.</p><p>Rio stumbled out of the elevator, her arm draped around a woman Agatha didn’t recognise. The woman was tall and effortlessly elegant, her laughter soft and melodic as she leaned into Rio’s side.</p><p>Agatha froze, watching as Rio adjusted her hold on the woman, steadying both of them. They were clearly tipsy—the kind of drunk where everything seemed funny, and the world tilted a little too much.</p><p>“Careful there,” Rio said with a low chuckle, her voice carrying down the hall. She was grinning, her usual confidence somehow even more pronounced in her loosened state.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She quickly turned back to her door, fumbling more aggressively with her keys. She didn’t want to be caught standing there, gawking like an idiot.</p><p>But, of course, Rio noticed her.</p><p>“Well, well,” Rio drawled, her tone dripping with amusement. “If it isn’t my favourite neighbour.”</p><p>Agatha felt a mix of frustration and embarrassment as she forced the door open, trying her best to ignore Rio’s presence. But Rio wasn’t going to make it easy.</p><p>Agatha sighed and muttered under her breath, “Could you keep it down? Some of us have to actually get up in the morning.” She winced at how sharp her tone came out. The alcohol wasn’t helping her control her words.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her smirk practically audible. “Oof, somebody’s grumpy.” She leaned a little closer to her companion, her voice dropping lower but still loud enough for Agatha to hear. “Maybe she needs to get laid or something. All that uptight energy’s gotta go somewhere.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened, the words cutting deeper than she expected. She snapped her head toward Rio, her face flushed with annoyance and alcohol-induced warmth. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, unfazed by Agatha’s sudden defensiveness. “What? I’m just saying. You’re always so… tense. A little fun wouldn’t kill you. Might actually be beneficial.” She shot a playful glance at the woman at her side, who laughed softly.</p><p>Agatha’s mind raced, the mix of irritation and self-consciousness hitting her all at once. She glared at Rio, struggling to find the right words. “I’m not uptight or <em>tense</em>. I’m just not an idiot who brings random people back at all hours of the night.”</p><p>“Oh, please,” Rio retorted, her voice dripping with amusement. “You can pretend you don’t care, but I think you’re just mad you’re not the one getting all my attention.”</p><p>Agatha's heart skipped a beat, her anger boiling over, but she kept her cool as best as she could. “Just…keep it down. I don’t need a play-by-play of your... whatever this is,” she shot back, finally stepping fully into her apartment and closing the door behind her with a little more force than necessary.</p><p>The sound of her heart pounding in her chest was almost drowned out by the ringing in her ears. <em>What she would do to wrap her hands around that woman’s throat. </em></p><p>She kicked off her shoes with a huff, the alcohol beginning to make her head spin a little. It had been a long night—her colleagues’ incessant chatter, Lilia’s teasing, Jen’s comments—and now Rio’s ridiculous antics. She didn’t know why it irritated her so much. She barely knew the woman. Sure, she was annoying as hell, but she wasn’t even worth this level of frustration. Why couldn’t Agatha just let it go?</p><p>After a few moments of stumbling around, she managed to get herself ready for bed. She tugged at the hem of her blouse, yanking it over her head with a slight wince, still a little off-balance from the drinks. She had meant to keep it short and get some rest, but as she climbed into bed, something in her mind kept replaying the conversation with Rio. She groaned in annoyance and rolled over, trying to shake it off.</p><p>The silence of her apartment should have been calming, but just as she was starting to drift off, there it was—the unmistakable sound of muffled laughter. It wasn’t loud enough to be intrusive, but it was there. And then… a moan. Soft but distinct.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped open, the warmth of alcohol evaporating into a cold, prickling feeling as she froze in her bed. <em>The wall.</em> It was only a wall separating her bedroom from Rio’s.</p><p>And Rio knew that. She<em> knew</em> the layout of their apartments.</p><p>The realisation settled uncomfortably in Agatha’s stomach. She closed her eyes tightly, trying to block out the sounds, but it was impossible. Every time she thought it would stop, it didn’t. She was painfully aware of the proximity, the thin wall between them doing nothing to soften the sounds of Rio’s evening activities.</p><p>This is ridiculous, Agatha thought, her face flushed with a mix of anger and frustration. She threw her pillow over her head, hoping to drown it all out, but it didn’t work. The muffled noises seemed to invade her space anyway, making her even more irritable.</p><p>She had told Rio to keep it down. She had made it clear she didn’t want to hear any of this. Yet here she was, trapped in her own apartment, trying to ignore the sounds of her annoying neighbour having what sounded like a great time.</p><p>Agatha let out a frustrated sigh and pulled the pillow off her head, staring at the ceiling, her mind racing with all the reasons she shouldn’t care. <em>She didn’t care.</em></p>

<p>The morning light sliced through the blinds in thin, golden slats, landing directly across Agatha’s face. She groaned, rolling onto her side in a futile attempt to escape it. Her head throbbed—a slow, punishing rhythm—and her stomach churned with the sour remnants of cheap tequila.</p><p>
<em>Brilliant decision-making, as always.</em>
</p><p>She cracked one eye open, immediately regretting it. Last night had been a blur of laughter, clinking glasses, and Jen’s relentless insistence on "just one more round." Agatha hadn’t planned on drinking that much, but somewhere between the peer pressure and the electric energy of the bar, she’d stopped keeping track.</p><p>Dragging herself upright, she winced at the stiffness in her limbs. The apartment was mercifully quiet—no unexpected guests, no reminders of last night’s questionable choices. She shuffled toward the bathroom, the cool tiles sending a shiver up her spine. The mirror wasn’t kind. Her eyes were shadowed, her skin paler than usual, and her hair was a tangled testament to a restless night.</p><p>As she splashed water on her face, flashes of the evening flickered in her mind. The music, the heat, the pulse of conversation. And Rio.</p><p>That smirk, the way she leaned in just a little too close, the challenge in her voice. There had been something different last night—something that felt like an unspoken dare. Or maybe it was just the alcohol playing tricks on her.</p><p>
<em>Get it together, Agatha.</em>
</p><p>She brushed off the thought as she tugged on a faded band tee and loose jeans, padding into the kitchen where the coffee machine whirred to life. The rich scent filled the space, a small comfort against the dull headache still gnawing at her skull. She took a slow sip, staring out the window, trying to shake the lingering haze.</p><p>She needed a distraction. And the bookstore—her sanctuary—was calling.</p><p>-</p><p>By the time she got home at 2 p.m., the morning’s peace had been replaced by the buzz of the city, the distant hum of traffic, and the warmth of a full stomach from lunch with Lilia.</p><p>As she reached her apartment door, something yellow caught her eye. A sticky note.</p><p>Agatha frowned, fingers hovering over it before she peeled it off. The handwriting was unmistakable—bold, slanted, and messy.</p><p>
<em>Peeler please - R</em>
</p><p>She scoffed. Typical. No explanation. No pleasantries. Just Rio being... Rio.</p><p>For a moment, she debated ignoring it. Let Rio suffer the consequences of whatever culinary disaster she was attempting. But as she stood there, the note burning between her fingers, she felt an inexplicable tug of curiosity.</p><p>With a sigh, she stuffed the note into her pocket and unlocked her door. The apartment felt emptier than usual, the silence pressing in from all sides. She kicked off her shoes and wandered into the kitchen, absentmindedly rearranging the clutter on the counter. A misplaced coffee mug, a pile of unopened mail, a stray pen—anything to keep her hands busy while her thoughts kept circling back.</p><p>Rio. With her stupid note. And her stupid smirk. And the way she always managed to wedge herself into Agatha’s mind like an annoying, persistent song.</p><p>Agatha set down a stack of papers with a sharp thud.</p><p>Fine. She’d find the damn peeler.</p><p>-</p><p>A few hours later, Agatha stood outside Rio's door, the small kitchen tool in her hand. She had told herself this was just a simple errand—drop the peeler off, get it over with—but the longer she stood there, the more she realised she’d built this moment up in her head. The irritation buzzing in her veins wasn’t just about the note. It was everything—the smugness, the teasing, the sounds from last night.</p><p>She took a breath and knocked, a little too forcefully.</p><p>The door swung open before she could knock again, and there was Rio, standing in the frame. Effortlessly casual as always—loose t-shirt, pyjama pants (<em>her own, for once</em>)—but somehow still exuding that maddening confidence. Like she’d been expecting this. Like she knew exactly what she was doing.</p><p>Agatha blinked, thrown for a second. She had anticipated the usual arrogance, the smirk, the smart remark. But Rio just stood there, unreadable, and that was somehow even more disarming.</p><p>“You here to drop off my peeler?” Rio asked, voice steady, but with something lingering beneath it. Like she was waiting for Agatha to say something else.</p><p>Agatha blinked again, then quickly recovered, holding out the peeler with a sharp, clipped tone. “Here. And thanks so much for keeping it down last night,” she added, sarcasm dripping from her words.</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched, amusement sparking in her dark eyes. And then, just as Agatha thought she might let it slide, there it was—that smirk. Slow. <em>Infuriating</em>.</p><p>"You're welcome,” Rio drawled. “I know how thin our walls are, so I did try and get her to keep it down…"</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened on the peeler as the words sank in. The casualness of it. The way Rio spoke so <em>matter-of-factly</em>, as if it wasn’t a big deal.</p><p>“You <em>tried</em>?” Agatha repeated, voice low with disbelief as her hand dropped back to her side and her grip on the peeler tightening in her fist. “You planned to be loud, didn’t you? And you just—” She cut herself off, jaw clenching. This was ridiculous. This conversation was ridiculous. But Rio’s steady gaze—calm, unwavering—pulled the words right out of her.</p><p>Rio leaned in just slightly, eyes nevr leaving Agatha’s. “I didn’t plan it,” she said, voice dropping just enough to make Agatha’s stomach twist. “But I’m not exactly <em>sorry</em> about it either.” A pause. Then, softer, more deliberate—<em> “Though if I knew you were listening so intently, I would have been a bit more enthusiastic myself.”</em></p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose, heat creeping up her neck. <em>Nope. Not doing this.</em></p><p>She turned on her heel, muttering a string of unintelligible curses under her breath.</p><p>“The peeler, Agatha,” Rio called after her, voice lazy, playful, <em>infuriating</em>. How many times can Agatha call this woman infuriating?</p><p>Agatha <em>almost</em> kept walking. Almost.</p><p>Grinding her teeth, she pivoted sharply, marching back toward Rio with stiff movements. She shoved the peeler into Rio’s waiting hand, her fingers barely grazing against Rio’s before she yanked them back like she’d been burned.</p><p>Rio accepted it slowly, deliberately, letting the moment stretch just long enough to be <em>noticed</em>. She met Agatha’s gaze, her smirk deepening. “Thanks,” she murmured, all smooth confidence.</p><p>Agatha’s heart thudded in her chest, pulse a little too fast. It was <em>just a peeler, damn it</em>. But Rio was looking at her like she <em>knew</em>—like she could <em>see</em> exactly what was happening in Agatha’s head, and worse, she was <em>enjoying it</em>.</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorframe, tilting her head slightly. “Bye, Agatha,” she said, soft but weighted. Like the words meant more than just goodbye.</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a second longer, her hand twitching at her side. Every instinct screamed at her to come up with a retort, <em>something</em> to wipe that smug look off Rio’s face. But nothing came.</p><p>She turned sharply on her heel. “Unbelievable,” she muttered, just loud enough for Rio to hear, before stalking back toward her apartment. She could <em>feel</em> Rio’s eyes on her, a presence that lingered even as she reached her door.</p><p>She slammed it shut behind her, pressing her back against the wood, exhaling slowly.</p><p>-</p><p>A week later, Agatha was exhausted. The workweek had dragged on, and she was more than ready to collapse on her couch with a cup of tea and a good book. She fumbled with her keys as she reached her apartment door, barely registering the familiar quiet of the hallway. It had been a hectic few days, and she was craving some peace and solitude.</p><p>When she opened the door, however, she froze.</p><p>There, sprawled out on her couch, was Rio. Of course it was Rio. The audacity of it.</p><p>“Are you serious?” Agatha blurted, stepping inside. Her bag slipped off her shoulder and thudded to the ground, but she didn’t bother to pick it up. Rio was lounging as though this was the most natural thing in the world, eyes fixed on the TV.</p><p>Rio turned lazily toward Agatha, a smirk already tugging at the corners of her mouth. “Evening, Agatha,” she said with casual nonchalance, like her presence was completely expected. “I hope you don’t mind. Thought I’d make myself comfortable.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, her jaw tightening in frustration. “You thought you’d make yourself comfortable?” She said slowly, crossing her arms, disbelief laced with irritation.</p><p>Rio patted the space next to her on the couch. “Come on, take a seat. I’m not here to cause trouble. We need to talk.”</p><p>“Talk about what?” Agatha asked, incredulous. “What is this? You’re creating a habit of breaking in lately. Should I be calling the cops?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. "That's no way to talk to someone who made you dinner." She pointed to the coffee table, where a plate of pasta sat, steam still rising from it.</p><p>Agatha blinked, the anger momentarily shifting to confusion. "Wait—what?"</p><p>"Sit," Rio said, her tone softening just a little. She leaned forward, picking up the plate and handing it to Agatha. It was still warm. How had she known Agatha would be home so late?</p><p>Agatha grumbled under her breath, finally accepting the plate and sitting down beside Rio—though she kept a healthy distance.</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered back to the TV, her faint smile far less mocking than usual.</p><p>“What do you want?” Agatha asked, her frustration giving way to curiosity. “I mean, what’s the deal? Why are you here?”</p><p>"Eat first," Rio said, her voice low but steady. "Then we'll talk."</p><p>Agatha huffed but couldn’t ignore the mouth-watering smell of the pasta. Her stomach growled as if it was a paid actor. It looked delicious. She didn’t know whether she was more irritated or impressed. She’d seen Rio in her kitchen plenty of times before, but this? This was a different level of strange.</p><p>Agatha squinted at Rio, suddenly suspicious. “Did you poison this?”</p><p>Rio laughed, a snort escaping her. “Poison you? Why would I bother?”</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because you’re weird and can’t just have a normal conversation?” Agatha’s voice dripped with sarcasm.</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning back against the couch. “Fair. But no, I didn’t poison it.”</p><p>“Promise?”</p><p>“Promise,” Rio replied, her voice amused.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, glancing between the plate and Rio’s face. Finally, her curiosity won out. She took a bite.</p><p>-</p><p>After the last bite, Agatha set the empty plate down on the coffee table. "It was good," she muttered, almost reluctantly. She hadn’t expected to be impressed, but the food was delicious—complex, surprising. She wasn’t exactly one to dish out compliments, but this was a welcome surprise.</p><p>“Told you,” Rio said, a small smirk still twitching at the corners of her mouth. “I can cook.”</p><p>“Fine, you can cook,” Agatha conceded, sitting back. “But why?”</p><p>Rio sighed, scratching the back of her neck. The gesture was almost awkward, at odds with her usual relaxed demeanour. Her smirk faded, and she glanced down at the empty plate as if gathering her thoughts.</p><p>“Listen,” she said, her voice suddenly softer, lacking the usual cocky edge. “I’m sorry about the other day.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. She hadn’t expected an apology. “You’re sorry?”</p><p>“I went too far,” Rio continued, shifting a little. “I don’t even know what I was thinking. But I shouldn’t have made you uncomf-”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha cut in, surprising herself. She hadn’t meant to interrupt, but there was something in Rio’s tone that made her pause. “I mean… you didn’t have to go through all this.” She gestured to the food. “You could’ve just, I don’t know, talked to me. Like a normal person.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked up to meet Agatha’s, and she let out a low chuckle. “Yeah, you’re right. I’m not great at normal.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, leaning back against the couch, a little more at ease now. “Tell me something I don’t know.”</p><p>“Okay, smartass,” Rio retorted, a grin creeping back onto her face. “I’ll try not to be so… <em>annoying</em>.”</p><p>“Yeah, that,” Agatha said, her lips quirking upward. “But seriously, I’m not going to hold it against you.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, the humour fading from her expression. “Look, I am sorry. Truly.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, studying her. It was strange seeing Rio this open—this vulnerable. And she was apologising. For real.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said softly, her voice more forgiving. “I mean… thanks. For the apology. And the food.”</p><p>“Sure,” Rio replied, her cocky grin returning. “So, have you thought about my invite?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “To what? The Christmas party?”</p><p>“Mhm.” Rio nodded, her gaze flickering back to the TV screen, but her focus was still on Agatha. “Have you?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, considering. She’d thought about it more than a few times, but something had held her back. “You said your coworker was overly touchy, right?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Rio groaned, rolling her eyes. “He’s… a lot. Not dangerous, but always way too close. Like, really close.”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha nodded slowly, piecing it together. “And you don’t like that.”</p><p>“Nope.” Rio popped the ‘p,’ her eyes twinkling. “That’s why I need someone who can send a very clear message.”</p><p>“So, what?” Agatha asked, raising an eyebrow. “I’m just supposed to pretend we’re dating or something?”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up, her lips curling into a half-smile. “I mean, that’s what they’ll assume, yeah.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples. “And what exactly are we going to tell them?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying her with an easy grin spreading across her face. “Oh, I’m sure we can come up with something.”</p><p>Agatha let out a long, slow exhale. “Fine. Whatever.”</p><p>Rio beamed. “Yay! You won’t regret it. We will have so much fun!”</p><p>Agatha looked at her with a flat expression. “Can you leave now?”</p><p>“Hm... no. I don’t feel like going home yet so you’re stuck with me for a bit.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and Rio rolled her eyes before speaking again, “Oh lighten up. Don’t act like I’m not the highlight of your day. Your week even. Or dare I say your life?” She let out a fake gasp and plopped back against the couch dramatically.</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes at her dramatics and tucked her legs underneath her.</p><p>Rio smirked at the shift, stretching her arms behind her head before shifting her attention to the remote. “Anyway, since I’m here, we might as well watch a movie. What’s your poison? Comedy, horror, <em>rom-com</em>?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but before she could get a word out, Rio had already clicked on a thriller, the eerie music swelling as the opening credits rolled.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. "You just asked me so you could ignore my answer."</p><p>Rio shot her a dazzling grin. "Exactly. But, hey, you get the illusion of choice. That counts for something."</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. "It absolutely does not."</p><p>Rio shrugged, getting comfortable. "Well, too late now. The movie already started. And, you know, if you get scared, you can always hold my hand. No judgment."</p><p>Agatha scoffed. "I would rather be murdered by Billy Loomis.”</p><p>Rio hummed. "Kinda dramatic, but I get it... who wouldn’t amiright?"</p><p>As the movie played, Rio made it her mission to be as obnoxious as possible. She gasped theatrically at obvious jump scares, leaned over to whisper ridiculous commentary in Agatha’s ear, and—on more than one occasion—casually draped her arm over the back of the couch, inching ever so slightly closer.</p><p>Agatha, to her credit, ignored most of it. But when Rio let out a particularly exaggerated yelp and grabbed her arm, she finally turned to glare at her.</p><p>"Rio."</p><p>"Yes, dear?"</p><p>Agatha sighed, exasperated. "Stop being a menace."</p><p>Rio grinned, clearly unapologetic. "I have no idea what you’re talking about."</p><p>Agatha shook her head, refocusing on the movie. "You’re lucky I haven’t smothered you with a pillow."</p><p>"You wouldn’t." Rio’s voice was full of confidence.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her. "Wouldn’t I?"</p><p>Rio just smirked, leaning in slightly. "Nope. You like me too much."</p><p>Agatha scoffed but didn’t move away. Rio chuckled, pleased with herself, and turned back to the screen and Agatha couldn’t help but watch her.</p><p>-</p><p>It had been a few days since their movie night, and Agatha still wasn’t sure what had convinced her to agree to the Christmas party. Sure, she wanted to help Rio out, but this felt extreme. She barely knew the woman—she was practically a stranger—and an infuriating one at that.</p><p>As Agatha sat in her living room scrolling through her phone, a loud knock echoed from her front door. The noise startled her so much she nearly dropped her phone. Who the hell could that be?</p><p>She rose to her feet, her annoyance growing, and strode over to the door. She swung it open to reveal Rio, standing there with a grin on her face, her hand poised to knock again.</p><p>“Evening, neighbour,” Rio said, lowering her arm.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha replied, still taken aback. She crossed her arms, leaning against the doorframe. “Surprised you even knocked. What do you want?”</p><p>“I was in the neighbourhood,” Rio said with exaggerated dramatic flair. Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Right,” she said flatly. “What do you want?” she repeated.</p><p>“Don’t be like that, Aggie,” Rio teased, her grin widening. Agatha felt a flare of irritation at the nickname. “I just thought we could go over our story... maybe practice a little.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up, and Rio’s face twisted into an infuriatingly smug expression. “Practice? What, like roleplay? Absolutely not. We can wing it on the night.” She made to close the door, but Rio blocked it with her foot.</p><p>“Ow,” Rio winced. “Listen, you’re good at lying, right? But I’m not. So, let’s make a plan. Y’know, since we got distracted the other night before we could actually come up with anything.”</p><p>“You think I’m good at lying?” Agatha asked incredulously, ignoring the remark about the other night. She had tried to forget about it. Too casual. Too friendly. They weren’t friends.</p><p>“Yeah, you’re always acting so standoffish. You can’t possibly be that much of a bitch, so you must be covering <em>something</em> up,” Rio reasoned.</p><p>“Wow. Thanks.” Agatha’s voice dripped with sarcasm, and she had every reason to slam the door in her face.</p><p>“Anyway, how did we meet? You know, the basics,” Rio asked, pushing her way into Agatha’s apartment. Agatha sighed and closed the door, turning to find Rio already lounging on the couch.</p><p>“Why can’t we just say we’re neighbours? It’s the truth,” Agatha offered, heading for the kitchen to grab a glass of water. Rio groaned and followed her.</p><p>“Neighbours isn’t a good enough story,” Rio complained, leaning against the kitchen counter.</p><p>“Oh, sorry. I forgot how important storytelling is to you,” Agatha muttered, rolling her eyes.</p><p>“Okay, fine. If you want to keep it simple, we can say we met at a party or something,” Rio suggested with a shrug.</p><p>“I’m 38 and I don’t like parties. You think anyone’s going to buy that?” Agatha pointed out.</p><p>“Okay, fair.” Rio tapped her fingers on the counter. “What about online? It’s the modern way to meet, right?”</p><p>Agatha sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. This was giving her a headache. “No, because we’re not actually dating.”</p><p>“So, you want people to think we met through a window or something? Because that’s the vibe you’re giving off,” Rio quipped.</p><p>“We’re not meeting in windows, and we’re not lying either,” Agatha shot back, her irritation growing. “I’m not good at making things up, so let’s just stick with the truth and improvise.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, clearly not thrilled with the idea. “Fine,” she said after a moment, sighing. “Let’s practice anyway. How are we going to make this convincing?”</p><p>Agatha groaned and dragged a hand through her hair. “Can’t we just go over it once we’re there? Like a quick run-through?”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, expression turning stubborn. “How do I know you’ll be able to sell it?”</p><p>Agatha finished her glass of water and set it down in the sink, turning to face Rio. “You don’t,” she said bluntly.</p><p>“Exactly. So we should go over it. What are our boundaries?” Rio pressed, taking a step closer to Agatha.</p><p>“What are our—We’re not talking boundaries right now,” Agatha sputtered, feeling her face flush.</p><p>“Then how are we going to know what we’re okay with? We’re not going to get through this if we don’t communicate,” Rio reasoned, her tone laced with sarcasm.</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, frustration rising. “Fine. You want to talk boundaries? Let’s talk boundaries.”</p><p>“Perfect,” Rio said, her tone shifting to serious. “Are you okay with me touching you? Holding hands, an arm around your waist, that kind of thing?”</p><p>“I mean… yes, that’s fine. If it’s necessary,” Agatha replied, trying to sound calm.</p><p>“Okay, good. How about kissing? Because if we’re going to sell this, I think we’ll need to—”</p><p>“Kissing?” Agatha blurted, her heart skipping a beat. “Like, on the lips?”</p><p>“Yeah, on the lips. Do you not know how kissing works? Because I can show—”</p><p>“I know how kissing works, thank you,” Agatha snapped, her face burning. She gripped the kitchen counter, trying to steady herself. “But kissing isn’t necessary, right? I mean, we’re not actually dating. We can just hold hands and stuff.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, a smirk pulling at her lips. “You think holding hands is going to be enough?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied firmly. “PDA isn’t necessary to sell a relationship.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a moment, a smirk still tugging at the corner of her mouth. “If you say so,” she said, sounding unconvinced. “Is there anywhere I’m not allowed to touch you?”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, willing herself to stay calm. “Anywhere you wouldn’t touch me as a friend.”</p><p>“Okay, that’s fair,” Rio said, seeming satisfied.</p><p>“Great,” Agatha replied, her tone clipped. She was starting to feel overwhelmed. She could handle touching, holding hands, but the thought of kissing was making her anxious. Was it because she was straight? Or was it just the idea of kissing Rio?</p><p>She refocused, meeting Rio’s gaze. The cocky grin was back on her face, the one that always made Agatha want to punch her. “So, you can leave now. I’m going to bed.”</p><p>“It’s 9 PM,” Rio pointed out, tilting her head slightly.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m tired. You wore me out,” Agatha shot back, turning and walking toward the front door to show Rio out.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure I could wear you out some more,” Rio teased, following her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t give her the satisfaction of a reaction and simply opened the door.</p><p>“Goodnight,” Agatha said curtly, expression neutral.</p><p>Rio chuckled as she stepped outside. “See you Saturday, Aggie,” she called over her shoulder with a wink.</p>

<p>The Christmas party was at a mini-golf course, and Agatha couldn’t decide what was more ridiculous—the concept itself or the fact that she was actually here, playing along with Rio’s insane scheme. The place was adorned with the most aggressively festive decorations she’d ever seen. Fairy lights clung to the course like ivy, oversized candy canes blocked the way as obstacles, and a giant inflatable Santa loomed by the entrance, its beady eyes unnervingly following her as she passed.</p><p>Rio, naturally, was in her element. She had thrown on a garish Christmas sweater featuring a winking reindeer, and her grin hadn’t wavered since they arrived. Agatha, on the other hand, was hyper-aware that she was about to spend the next few hours pretending to be Rio’s girlfriend in front of a crowd of strangers.</p><p>As they made their way toward the group of colleagues, Agatha paused, suddenly realising something. “Wait,” she said, narrowing her eyes at Rio. “I don’t even know what you do for work.”</p><p>Rio nearly choked on her laughter. “Aggie, we’ve been fake dating for five minutes and you’re already questioning my employment status?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha deadpanned. “It seems like a pretty fundamental detail, seeing as this is your <em>work</em> party.”</p><p>“I work in marketing,” Rio answered with a grin, “social media and branding, mostly. Explains why I’m so charming.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Charming? Not the word I'd use, but okay.”</p><p>Before Rio could reply, Agatha noticed a figure looming at the edge of the crowd—a tall, broad-shouldered man, standing just a little too still. His presence felt too familiar, the type of guy she’d met a hundred times before, with a smirk that made her want to avoid him at all costs. This <em>had</em> to be the touchy coworker Rio had warned her about. Of course, he was the first one to approach them.</p><p>“Hey, Rio,” he greeted, briefly glancing at Agatha before turning his attention back to Rio, a look that made Agatha’s skin crawl. “This must be the mysterious girlfriend. We were all wondering if she were real.” His eyes lingered on Rio, never once fully meeting Agatha's gaze, and Agatha fought the urge to punch him in the face.</p><p>She felt Rio shift closer, her hand slipping naturally into Agatha’s. “Yep,” Rio said easily, her voice light and confident. “This is Agatha. Agatha, this is Steve.” She gave Agatha’s hand a quick, reassuring squeeze, and Agatha’s heart skipped a beat. <em>This was going to be a long night.</em></p><p>Steve extended his hand, and Agatha reluctantly pulled hers from Rio’s, briefly shaking his hand. His grip was too firm, lingering a fraction longer than necessary. Agatha fought the urge to yank her hand back with force, instead pulling it slowly, deliberately, wrapping it around Rio’s waist as if to stake her claim. Rio didn’t seem surprised by the gesture, though Agatha felt her press a little more firmly against her side, her arm sliding around her waist in return. The awkward silence between them seemed to stretch, Steve’s eyes flicking down to where their bodies connected.</p><p>“So... she’s real, huh?” Steve mused, his tone teasing, but there was an edge of skepticism that grated on Agatha’s nerves. Why wouldn’t this jerk just walk away already? He was blocking the entrance. “Guess that ruins my theory.”</p><p>“What theory?” Agatha asked, her voice sharp as she tilted her head. She caught Rio’s subtle groan beside her, too quiet for Steve to hear.</p><p>“That Rio just made up a fake girlfriend to keep me at bay.”</p><p>Agatha barely stopped herself from grimacing. She could already see why Rio needed backup. “Well,” she said, forcing a smile, “I am<em> very </em>real. Maybe you should learn to take no for an answer, whether or not the person you’re interested in is in a relationship.”</p><p>She felt Rio stiffen beside her, surprise flickering in her expression, but it quickly morphed into a small, amused smile. Agatha wasn’t sure if it was because of her response or something else, but she couldn’t help but feel a small surge of satisfaction at the reaction.</p><p>Steve’s smirk faltered, his mouth opening as if to respond—but before he could, a new voice cut through the conversation.</p><p>“There you are! Oh my god, Rio, you didn’t tell me she was <em>this</em> gorgeous.”</p><p>The new woman’s voice was warm and full of enthusiasm. She had an edgy vibe, with black hair cascading over her shoulders and orange-tipped ends that caught the light as she moved. Her smile was wide and inviting as she walked toward them with her arms spread out, clearly expecting a hug or some other show of affection. Agatha immediately felt her cheeks heat, the compliment making her awkward. Rio’s hand squeezed her side as she gave the woman a small side hug with her spare arm, and Agatha flinched, feeling her heartbeat jump at the touch.</p><p>Steve, seemingly annoyed by the interruption, cleared his throat. His gaze shifted away from Rio for the first time since he’d approached them. “Alright, well, I guess I should go find the others,” he muttered, obviously eager to escape. “See you around, Rio. Nice to meet you, Agatha. Sorry if I came off as too forward. Didn’t mean anything by it. You know how it is around Christmas time. People get a little wild, flirtatious, and all that. Hope you enjoy the party, ladies. Let me know if you need anything. Anything at all, Rio. I’m here for you, okay? Bye-bye now. Have a good evening.”</p><p>Agatha stood there, her teeth clenched as Steve rambled. Seriously, this guy was like a broken record. The urge to throttle him was almost overwhelming. <em>Okay, maybe that’s a bit extreme,</em> she thought to herself, but not by much.</p><p>Once Steve had disappeared back into the throng of partygoers, the newcomer turned to Rio, her eyebrows raised in curiosity. “Did I interrupt something?” she asked, her eyes wide in playful amusement.</p><p>Rio waved her hand dismissively. “Nah, you were saving us, honestly. He was just being weird again.” She glanced at Agatha, her grin widening. “Aggie, this is my friend Alice. She’s in my department and, well, she knows the whole story about why I brought you tonight.”</p><p>Alice gave Agatha a knowing smile, her eyes sparkling as she took in her appearance. “She failed to mention how stunning you are, though. I’m so glad you’re here to help her with Steve. He’s honestly one move away from being reported.” Alice's voice was laced with a mischievous energy that instantly put Agatha at ease, her earlier awkwardness softening a little.</p><p>As Alice spoke, Agatha became acutely aware of the way her arm was still wrapped around Rio—<em>tightly</em>. Her hand rested on Rio's hip, and Rio, it seemed, was leaning into her slightly, as if they were already comfortable in each other's space. It took Agatha a moment to process, but once she did, the heat in her face flared up again. <em>Oh God. What am I doing?</em></p><p>Clearing her throat, Agatha slowly unwrapped her arm from around Rio’s waist. The loss of Rio’s warmth was almost immediate, and she couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. She quickly tried to brush off the feeling, mumbling, “Sorry,” hoping her face wasn’t too red. The last thing she needed was Rio teasing her about it later.</p><p>Rio flashed her an easy smile, stepping back slightly, though her eyes held a glimmer of something that Agatha couldn’t quite place. “It’s fine,” she said, though Agatha noticed the brief flicker of hesitation before Rio dropped her hand from Agatha’s waist. A part of Agatha wished she’d pull her back, but she didn’t want to <em>think</em> about why that was.</p><p>Shifting uncomfortably, Agatha glanced up at Alice, who was watching her with an amused expression. “Uh, thanks,” she replied quickly, her voice awkward as she tried to gather her thoughts. “I’m happy to help.” She wasn’t sure how to respond, not knowing whether she was trying to convince Alice or herself.</p><p>Alice’s grin widened as her eyes danced between Agatha and Rio. “I’ll leave you to the course, then,” she said, her voice light with humour. “Don’t worry, the drinks are free. Enjoy!” She winked playfully at Agatha, who felt her face burn even hotter.</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha muttered, trying to hide her red face behind her hair as Alice made her way off toward the rest of the party.</p><p>Rio’s gaze lingered on Agatha for a beat longer than was necessary, but when she spoke, her voice was casual. “You okay?” she asked, her tone soft with something almost teasing beneath it.</p><p>Agatha nodded quickly, though her heart was still thudding in her chest. “Yeah, just… just peachy,” she said, giving Rio a half-smile, trying to recover her usual composure.</p><p>Rio smirked. “Well then, are you ready to play mini-golf, <em>fake girlfriend</em>?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “I don’t really play sports.”</p><p>Rio gasped dramatically. “You wound me.”</p><p>“But” Agatha continued, ignoring her, “I’m willing to try anything once, I guess.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk deepened, and she arched an eyebrow. “<em>Anything</em>?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart did an entirely unnecessary thump. <em>There she was.</em> The Rio who thrived on making her flustered. She cleared her throat and pointedly ignored the comment, scanning the course like it was suddenly the most interesting thing in the world.</p><p>Rio laughed, clearly pleased with herself, and took Agatha’s hand, tugging her toward the golf clubs. The casual touch shouldn’t have sent a jolt of warmth up Agatha’s arm, but it did, and she had no idea what to do with that.</p><p>“It’s barely a sport, Agatha,” Rio teased, selecting two clubs and handing one over. “Don’t worry, I’ll go easy on you.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, gripping the club tightly and ignoring the way her palm still tingled from Rio’s touch. “Don’t hold back on my account.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes gleamed with something dangerous. “You might regret saying that.”</p><p>She grabbed a pink ball for herself and handed Agatha a blue one before nodding toward the start of the course. “Shall we?”</p><p>“Lead the way,” Agatha agreed, falling into step beside her.</p><p>In her head, she was already strategizing. She had <em>never</em> played mini golf before, but she was not about to lose. She was 38, and she had a competitive streak that had ended friendships before. She would <em>win</em>.</p><p>Rio set her ball down first, stretching her arms dramatically like she was about to do something impressive. “Okay, so,” she began, “first rule of mini-golf is—there are no rules.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “That doesn’t sound right.”</p><p>Rio ignored her. “Second rule—” she continued, lining up her shot, “aim for the hole.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. “Obviously.”</p><p>Ignored <em>again</em>.</p><p>“Third rule—”</p><p>“How many rules are there? Didn’t you just say there were no rules?”</p><p>Rio turned her head slowly, raising a single warning eyebrow. “Third rule is <em>don’t interrupt the master</em>.”</p><p>Agatha bit back a smirk, rolling her eyes. “Oh, <em>master</em>, is it?”</p><p>“Yes. The <em>Mini-Golf Master</em>.”</p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p>Rio grinned and continued. “And fourth rule…” She paused, tapping her chin with the club. “Nope, I think that’s it.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “You just made all that up.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk widened. “Maybe.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Are you going to hit the ball <em>anytime</em> soon?”</p><p>“Patience,” Rio chided, turning her focus back to the course. She squared her stance, squinted as if she were calculating the perfect shot, then pulled back and swung. The club connected with the ball with a soft <em>thwack</em>, sending it rolling neatly across the green, veering slightly left—before dropping directly into the hole.</p><p>Agatha blinked. <em>What.</em></p><p>Rio spun on her heel, eyes alight with amusement. “Not bad, huh?”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “Whatever.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, stepping aside as Agatha moved into place. “Let’s see what you’ve got, then.”</p><p>Agatha set her ball down, gripping her club tightly. She lined up her shot, adjusted her stance like she’d seen Rio do, and swung.</p><p>She immediately regretted her confidence.</p><p>The ball ricocheted off the edge of the hole, bounced backward, and rolled to a stop a solid three feet from where it started.</p><p>Rio’s laughter rang through the air, bright and teasing.</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw and turned away. “It was my first try,” she huffed.</p><p>“I <em>know</em>,” Rio said, her voice full of faux sympathy. “I just expected a little more…” She trailed off, as if searching for the right word. “<em>Competence</em>.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare. “I hope you fall into the water feature.”</p><p>Rio beamed. “Aw, you’re so sweet to me.”</p><p>Agatha tried to stay annoyed, but it was getting increasingly difficult. Especially when Rio was standing there, looking at her with that damn smirk, her dimples deepening, her eyes catching the glow of the fairy lights like something out of a Christmas movie.</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>After three more tries—each more humiliating than the last—Rio finally took pity on her. Or, more likely, she saw another opportunity to be insufferable.</p><p>Agatha had just lined up her shot again when she felt Rio step in behind her, impossibly close, her hands sliding over Agatha’s own.</p><p>"Like this," Rio murmured, voice low and smug, guiding Agatha’s hands with featherlight touches.</p><p>Agatha stiffened. <em>Nope. Absolutely not.</em></p><p>"I'm not sure that's gonna help," she muttered, trying to focus on the club and not the fact that Rio’s front was now pressed up against her back, warm and solid. She could feel the shape of her, the way she fit against her like a puzzle piece she <em>definitely</em> didn’t need to be thinking about right now.</p><p>Rio laughed, her breath brushing the back of Agatha's neck, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine. "Oh, Aggie," she teased, her fingers flexing slightly over Agatha’s. "Have a little faith."</p><p>Agatha had <em>none</em>.</p><p>None in Rio. None in this ridiculous game. None in herself, because her pulse was behaving in a way that was both unacceptable and entirely predictable.</p><p>And then—Rio stepped away, her hands trailing off Agatha’s in a way that felt far too intentional. <em>Damn her.</em></p><p>"Try it," Rio urged, like she hadn’t just ruined every ounce of Agatha’s ability to function.</p><p>Agatha scowled, repeating mockingly, <em>“Try it.”</em> Then, louder, "I <em>will</em>," and took her shot.</p><p>The ball sailed right past the hole, bouncing off the edge and rolling away like it had <em>personally</em> decided to embarrass her.</p><p>Rio burst into laughter, full and delighted, shaking her head. "<em>Aggie.</em>"</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. "That was <em>your</em> fault."</p><p>"Oh?" Rio arched an eyebrow, taking a step towards her, "<em>My</em> fault?"</p><p>"Yes," Agatha snapped, resisting the urge to fling her club into the nearest decorative Santa.</p><p>"Interesting," Rio mused. "Because I distinctly remember <em>you</em> taking the shot."</p><p>Agatha turned to glare at her, but Rio was already grinning, smug and infuriating, and—<em>oh, for the love of—</em></p><p>Rio reached out and flicked Agatha’s nose.</p><p>Agatha jerked back, scandalised. “Did you just—”</p><p>"You're so <em>cute</em> when you're flustered," Rio said breezily, twirling her club like she was twirling a villainous moustache. "It’s almost a shame you’re so bad at this."</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply. She would not kill her. This was a work event. There were <em>witnesses</em>.</p><p>"You are <em>the worst person I have ever met,</em>" she hissed, willing her face <em>not</em> to turn any redder.</p><p>Rio pouted, unbothered. "That can't be true. I’m delightful."</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose and turned back to the course, gripping her club a little <em>too</em> tightly.</p><p>"Would it help if I promised not to tease you <em>too</em> much if you make this next shot?" Rio asked, tone full of mischief.</p><p>Agatha refused to dignify that with a response.</p><p>They made it through three more holes—Agatha getting increasingly frustrated, Rio getting increasingly <em>insufferable</em>—before Agatha called for a break.</p><p>"Drinks," she announced, cutting off Rio mid-taunt as she waved toward the little concession stand near the course. "If I have to keep playing, I need a drink first."</p><p>Rio gasped, pressing a hand to her chest in mock horror. "Giving up already?"</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. "I am <em>strategising.</em>"</p><p>"Ah," Rio said, nodding perceptively. "The <em>classic</em> ‘get tipsy and somehow become a mini-golf prodigy’ technique. Bold."</p><p>"Are you going to let me drink in peace, or do I have to push you into one of these giant candy canes?"</p><p>Rio grinned. "Oh, by all means, <em>push me,</em> Aggie. I <em>love</em> being manhandled."</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply and stomped toward the bar, pointedly ignoring Rio’s laughter behind her.</p><p>The concession stand was a gaudy little setup, strung with blinking multi-coloured lights that looked like they might give someone a seizure. The menu offered a selection of overly sweet holiday-themed cocktails, along with beer, wine, and a tragic attempt at a hot chocolate station.</p><p>Rio leaned against the counter, scanning the options. "What'll it be, fake girlfriend?"</p><p>"Anything with alcohol," Agatha said. "A <em>lot</em> of alcohol."</p><p>Rio turned to the bartender. "She'll have a mulled wine. I'll take a spiked eggnog, <em>extra</em> whipped cream."</p><p>Agatha gave her a look. "Do you just want the excuse to lick it off the top dramatically?"</p><p>Rio gasped, delighted. "Oh my god, you <em>do</em> know me."</p><p>Agatha groaned and turned away, eyes landing on a group of Rio’s coworkers gathered near one of the high tables. Unfortunately, before she could even attempt to drink in peace, Rio spotted them too.</p><p>"Oh, hey, we should probably go say hi."</p><p>Agatha stared at her. "<em>Must</em> we?"</p><p>"Yes, we <em>must.</em>" Rio grabbed her by the sleeve and tugged her toward the group, ignoring Agatha’s whispered threats of bodily harm.</p><p>"Everyone, this is Agatha," Rio announced grandly as they reached the table. "My lovely, talented, <em>very real</em> girlfriend."</p><p>Agatha barely resisted the urge to bury her face in her hands.</p><p>The group greeted her with various degrees of warmth and curiosity, some clearly amused by the whole charade, others just happy to put a name to Rio’s mysterious plus-one. Alice was there, shooting Agatha a knowing smirk, and a few other people introduced themselves between sips of their drinks.</p><p>"So, Aggie," a tall, wiry guy named Billy said, leaning on the table, "how’d Rio <em>rope</em> you into this?"</p><p>Before Agatha could answer, Rio clutched at her chest dramatically. "<em>Rope</em>? <em>Rope</em>? Excuse me, <em>Billy,</em> but Agatha is <em>madly</em> in love with me."</p><p>Agatha blinked, startled. "<em>I</em>—"</p><p>"It’s <em>tragic,</em> really," Rio continued, undeterred. "She’s completely helpless against my charm. She saw me once and immediately swooned."</p><p>Alice snorted into her drink. "That does <em>not</em> sound like Agatha." Jeez, how much had Rio told Alice about her?</p><p>"It <em>isn't,</em>" Agatha said flatly, shooting Rio a glare.</p><p>"Oh, come <em>on,</em>" Rio whined, nudging her. "Just <em>pretend</em> I swept you off your feet, <em>Aggie.</em>"</p><p>Agatha took a slow sip of her wine, considering her options. Then, in the driest tone possible, she said, “Fine. She swept me off my feet. Unfortunately, I must have blacked out from the impact, because I woke up and somehow, we were dating.”</p><p>The group erupted into laughter, and Rio, the absolute menace that she was, leaned in close, her voice low and teasing. “Oh, thank you for playing along, Aggie. I’ll make sure to <em>reward</em> you later.”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her drink.</p><p>She shot Rio a withering look, but Rio just grinned, clearly enjoying how flustered Agatha had become. She was about to retaliate when she noticed something odd—Steve, standing just a little outside the group, suddenly <em>very</em> interested in his drink. He hadn’t said a word since they arrived, and more importantly, he was <em>pointedly</em> avoiding looking at them.</p><p>That was… surprising.</p><p>Agatha expected him to interject, to make some snide remark, or at the very least, keep up whatever annoying bravado he had going earlier. But instead, he seemed to have shrunk into himself, his eyes flicking anywhere but at her and Rio.</p><p>
<em>Interesting.</em>
</p><p>She glanced at Rio, who was too busy grinning at something Alice had said to notice. Maybe Steve had finally gotten the message. Maybe her earlier remark had hit harder than she thought.</p><p>Or maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, he was recalibrating—trying to find another angle, another way to push Rio’s buttons.</p><p>Agatha didn’t trust it.</p><p>She leaned in slightly toward Rio and murmured, “Steve’s awfully quiet all of a sudden.”</p><p>Rio blinked, then subtly turned her head toward him before looking back at Agatha, her brow lifting. “Huh. He is.”</p><p>“I don’t like it.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “You <em>do</em> care about me.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I just don’t trust him.”</p><p>"Relax, <em>babe,"</em> Rio teased, purposefully draping an arm around Agatha’s waist and whispered. "<em>That’s why I have you here with me</em>."</p><p>Agatha sighed, willing herself not to react to the casual touch. "Just… keep an eye on him."</p><p>Rio's smirk softened into something almost thoughtful. "I always do."</p><p>The night wore on in a blur of drinks, laughter, and forced smiles. Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she’d attended a party quite like this—pretending to be someone’s girlfriend in front of a group of strangers, with Rio constantly by her side. Every time Agatha felt herself pull away, Rio seemed to close the distance, her touch always a little too warm, her presence a little too close.</p><p>The constant physical contact was starting to blur the lines. Rio had her arm around her waist, had tucked herself under Agatha’s shoulder more than once, and each time, Agatha found herself <em>not</em> pulling away. In fact, she was starting to feel a strange, almost reluctant comfort in it. When Rio leaned against her, her hand brushing just a little too low on her back or her fingers grazing her arm, Agatha’s pulse would race for a split second before she reminded herself—<em>it’s just for the act.</em></p><p>But the thing was, it didn’t feel like just an act anymore. Not when Rio’s fingers lingered a little too long on her skin, or when she caught Agatha’s eye with that teasing, almost flirtatious glint. It made her stomach do little flips, like Rio was playing a game <em>she</em> didn’t know the rules to.</p><p>By the time the evening started winding down, Agatha was ready to call it quits. The evening had stretched longer than she'd expected, her forced smiles starting to feel more like actual strain. She was exhausted—physically from the constant movement and mentally from the underlying tension, trying to stay focused while pretending that the little electric touches from Rio didn’t make her skin hum in ways it shouldn’t.</p><p>Rio was still floating around, effortlessly charming everyone and holding court with her colleagues. Agatha had long since lost track of time, but she found herself counting the minutes until she could finally escape to the quiet of her own space.</p><p>She glanced at the clock on the wall. <em>Definitely time to go.</em> She shifted uncomfortably, trying to ignore the fact that Rio’s hand had somehow found its way back to her waist again.</p><p>"Okay, this has been fun and all," Agatha said, trying to inject some finality into her voice, though it came out a little softer than she'd intended. "But I think it’s time to wrap it up, don’t you think?"</p><p>Rio’s arm tightened slightly around her, not in a way that felt possessive, but more like an invitation to stay longer, like she didn’t want the night to end. Agatha tried to ignore the way it made her stomach flip again.</p><p>“Already?” Rio asked, her voice laced with playful disbelief, as if she was genuinely enjoying herself. She lowered her voice and lent in as she said, “I thought you were having fun pretending to be my girlfriend, Aggie.”</p><p>Agatha had long ago stopped drinking, as she had to drive them home, but Rio’s proximity made her head swim, nonetheless. But she could say the opposite for Rio.</p><p>"Believe me, I’m all for playing pretend, but I think I’ve paid you back thoroughly and have earned a good night’s sleep," Agatha replied dryly, though there was a hint of softness to it.</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened too, just for a second, before she winked. “I think you’ve earned a lot more than that. You’ve been the perfect date.”</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes. “I’m sure I’ve been a delight to everyone here, but I’m still ready to go home.”</p><p>“Mm, alright. But I’ll let you in on a little secret,” Rio said, voice lowering like she was sharing some sort of confidant’s whisper. She leaned in just a little closer, her lips brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear. “I’ll miss having you this close, Aggie.”</p><p>Agatha froze for a second, not sure if the words were playful or if there was something else behind them. She quickly pushed the thought away. <em>It’s just part of the act. Just a game.</em></p><p>“I’m sure you will,” Agatha muttered, trying to shrug off the fluttering sensation in her chest. She smiled, but it felt more forced than the ones she’d been giving all night. She was finding it increasingly harder to remind herself she was straight and that this meant nothing.</p><p>Rio pulled back, an unreadable look flashing in her eyes before her grin returned, all charm. “Alright, alright. Let’s get out of here then.”</p><p>They said their goodbyes before they began walking toward the exit. Agatha found herself deliberately not looking at Rio, focusing instead on her shoes or the path ahead. She was too tired to deal with whatever this night had stirred up. <em>Just get through the door and you’ll be fine,</em> she thought. <em>Just keep reminding yourself—it’s an act.</em></p><p>Rio’s hand brushed against her back again, a comforting weight she couldn’t help but feel in every nerve of her body. Agatha sucked in a sharp breath but kept walking, telling herself it wasn’t real, it wasn’t real, <em>it wasn’t real. </em></p><p>As they stepped outside, the crisp night air hit Agatha’s skin, a welcome contrast to the heat still lingering under her collar. The party’s noise dulled behind them, replaced by the quiet hum of the city. She exhaled, letting the cool air steady her.</p><p>Rio stretched her arms above her head, her cropped sweater riding up just enough to reveal a sliver of toned stomach. Agatha looked away quickly, clearing her throat.</p><p>“Alright, let’s get you home before you start causing more trouble,” she said, walking toward the car.</p><p>Rio hummed as she followed, falling into step beside her. “You say that like I’ve been trouble all night.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a flat look.</p><p>Rio gasped, pressing a hand to her chest in mock offense. “Aggie, that’s hurtful. I was <em>charming.</em>”</p><p>“You were <em>something,</em>” Agatha muttered, unlocking the car.</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning against the passenger door before getting in. “Admit it, you liked having me all over you.”</p><p>Agatha refused to dignify that with an answer. She simply slid into the driver’s seat, hands gripping the steering wheel a little too tightly.</p><p>The drive back to their building was quiet, save for the soft hum of the radio and the occasional rustle of Rio shifting in her seat. Agatha kept her eyes fixed on the road, determined not to acknowledge the warmth radiating from the passenger side or the way Rio had propped her elbow against the window, studying her with lazy amusement.</p><p>When they finally pulled into their usual parking spots, neither moved right away. Agatha drummed her fingers against the steering wheel before finally exhaling and unbuckling her seatbelt. "Alright. Home safe and sound."</p><p>Rio stretched, arms lifting above her head again, her voice laced with a teasing lilt. "You’re really rushing to get rid of me, huh?"</p><p>"Yes," Agatha deadpanned, pushing open her door.</p><p>Rio laughed, hopping out of the car and falling into step beside her as they walked toward their building. Their shoulders brushed, but neither pulled away.</p><p>By the time they reached their floor, a strange quiet settled between them. Not uncomfortable, just… lingering. Agatha hesitated in front of her door, keys in hand. Rio mirrored her, standing in front of her own apartment just across the hall, but not moving to unlock it.</p><p>It was stupid. This whole night had been stupid. It was pretend. A performance. And yet, as they stood there, neither making the move to say <em>good night</em> and go their separate ways, it felt like something was still hanging in the air between them.</p><p>Agatha shifted, clearing her throat. "Well."</p><p>Rio smirked. "Well."</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>Agatha found herself gripping her keys tighter. It was late. She was exhausted. She should just turn around, go inside, and pretend the warmth on her skin wasn’t from the way Rio had leaned into her all night.</p><p>But then Rio tilted her head, her eyes flickering with something unreadable, and Agatha felt her breath hitch. "You know," Rio said, voice softer now, "you really were the perfect fake girlfriend tonight."</p><p>Agatha swallowed. "Glad to be of service."</p><p>Another beat of silence. This was her chance to leave—to break the spell of whatever this was. But she didn’t move. And neither did Rio.</p><p>Instead, Rio took half a step closer, like she had something else to say, something important. But at the last second, she only grinned and tapped a single finger under Agatha’s chin, a barely-there touch that still sent something sharp through her chest. "Night, Aggie."</p><p>And just like that, Rio turned, slipping into her apartment without another word.</p><p>Agatha stood frozen for a second, heart doing something irritatingly uneven in her chest. Then, with a muttered curse to herself, she shoved her key into her lock and went inside.</p><p>Agatha let out a long breath—one she hadn’t even realised she was holding—as the door clicked shut behind her. The night had stretched longer than she anticipated, and yet, despite her exhaustion, her mind wouldn’t settle.</p><p>She moved through her usual nighttime routine on autopilot, stripping out of her clothes and tugging on an oversized T-shirt, her skin still faintly buzzing from the lingering warmth of Rio’s touch. Her fingers hovered for a second at her waist—right where Rio’s hand had rested so casually all night.</p><p>Shaking the thought away, she climbed into bed, willing herself to sleep. But as she lay there, staring at the ceiling, the night replayed in her head like a film reel she couldn't turn off. The way Rio had pulled her closer, whispered in her ear, touched her like it was second nature. Agatha kept telling herself it was just for the act, but the way her body reacted to the memories said otherwise.</p><p>She sighed and rolled onto her side, squeezing her eyes shut. Sleep. She just needed sleep.</p><p>Then she heard it.</p><p>A sound—soft, muffled, almost indistinct through the walls.</p><p>At first, she thought she imagined it, just the remnants of her overactive mind conjuring things. But then it came again, clearer this time.</p><p>A moan.</p><p>Agatha stilled, her entire body going rigid.</p><p>No. No way.</p><p>Her ears strained, heart thudding in her chest.</p><p>Another moan. This one undeniably real. Undeniably coming from Rio’s apartment.</p><p>Her stomach flipped, a flush creeping up her neck before she could even process why.</p><p>She should roll over. Ignore it. Pretend she hadn't heard anything. It was none of her business.</p><p>But the sounds kept coming, each one more breathy, more desperate, slipping through the thin walls like they were meant for her ears alone.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat suddenly dry.</p><p>Surely Rio didn’t have someone over. She had been with her not twenty minutes ago, and there had been no indication—no flirtatious parting words, no text or secret smirk that hinted at someone waiting for her.</p><p>So then…</p><p>The realisation hit her like a punch to the stomach.</p><p>Rio was alone.</p><p>A slow, creeping heat coiled in Agatha’s gut, unwanted and impossible to ignore. She squeezed her eyes shut, pressing her face into her pillow, trying to drown out the sounds.</p><p>But her mind was already filling in the gaps.</p><p>Rio, stretched out on her bed, her hair fanned across the pillows, fingers dipping between her thighs, lips parted on a soft sigh.</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched.</p><p>It was wrong. <em>So</em> wrong.</p><p>She shouldn’t be listening. She <em>definitely</em> shouldn’t be thinking about it.</p><p>And yet, her body betrayed her, her skin prickling with warmth, her thighs pressing together involuntarily.</p><p>God, when was the last time she had been touched like that? The last time she had let herself <em>want</em>?</p><p>Her hand twitched against her stomach, a whisper of movement, her fingers ghosting just beneath the hem of her shirt.</p><p>This was just curiosity, right? A natural reaction to hearing something so intimate?</p><p>But as another broken moan slipped through the wall, sending a shiver straight down her spine, Agatha knew—<em>this</em> was not just curiosity.</p><p>Agatha's fingers flexed against the fabric of her shirt, her breathing shallow as she clenched her jaw.</p><p>She needed to stop.</p><p>She needed to roll over, shove a pillow over her head, <em>anything</em> to block out the sounds coming through the wall.</p><p>But her body wasn’t listening.</p><p>Another moan drifted through the quiet, this one more drawn out, more <em>needy</em>, and Agatha felt the heat between her legs pulse in response.</p><p>She squeezed her thighs together, biting down hard on the inside of her cheek. <em>This is ridiculous. This is Rio.</em></p><p>Rio, who was constantly in her space, always teasing, always touching.</p><p>Rio, who had draped herself over Agatha all night like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Rio, who was currently <em>pleasuring herself</em> mere feet away, completely unaware of the way Agatha was falling apart just listening. Or maybe she was aware.</p><p>A shaky exhale escaped her lips as her hand slid lower, fingertips grazing just beneath the band of her underwear before she <em>snatched</em> it back, her entire body jolting like she had been burned.</p><p>
<em>No. Absolutely not.</em>
</p><p>She ripped the blankets off her legs, sitting up so fast she nearly made herself dizzy.</p><p>She needed air. Space. Distance.</p><p>Throwing her legs over the side of the bed, she pressed her feet into the floor, grounding herself. She ran a hand through her hair, trying to will away the heat that had settled deep in her bones.</p><p>The moans were softer now, more erratic.</p><p>Agatha clenched her fists.</p><p>She shouldn’t still be listening, shouldn’t be hyper-focused on the final, breathy whimper that sent a fresh wave of warmth through her.</p><p>Then silence.</p><p>She exhaled, long and shaky.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>Agatha let out a breathy, almost <em>disbelieving</em> laugh at herself. She had been seconds—<em>seconds</em>—away from doing something she’d never be able to come back from.</p><p>This was <em>Rio</em>, her <em>annoying</em>, infuriating <em>neighbour</em>.</p><p>This was <em>not</em> supposed to happen.</p><p>Swallowing hard, she forced herself to lie back down, rolling onto her side and yanking the blanket over her body like it could smother out everything she was feeling.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>It was <em>just</em> the act getting to her. That was all.</p><p>She was touch-starved, that was it.</p><p>It didn’t <em>mean</em> anything.</p><p>It couldn’t.</p><p>But as she lay there, staring at the wall that separated them, her body still humming with unwanted heat, she couldn’t ignore the truth clawing its way to the surface.</p><p>She had never been curious about women before.</p><p>So why did she suddenly feel like she was one bad decision away from knocking on Rio’s door?</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The next day, Agatha tried to convince herself that she <em>wasn't</em> avoiding Rio. She went out to grab groceries, hoping the mundane task would distract her from the gnawing discomfort that had settled in her stomach since the night before. She was back in her apartment before she even had a chance to bump into her.</p><p>She <em>wasn't</em> avoiding her. She was just... cautious. Cautious because, after everything that had happened, she wasn't sure how to navigate the sudden shift between them. She wasn't even sure what had changed—maybe nothing at all—but it felt like something had.</p><p>As the days passed, and she managed to not see Rio for a full week, she realised that maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, she <em>was</em> avoiding her. The realisation hit her like a wave, and she couldn’t quite figure out why it had taken her so long to admit it. Was it the awkwardness? The vulnerability? She wasn’t sure. But did that mean Rio was avoiding her, too?</p><p>The idea was almost laughable. Rio wasn’t the type to shy away from confrontation. No, Rio was bold. Rio was <em>confident</em>. And if she knew Agatha had heard her moans the other night—surely she must know—she would’ve said something by now. Rio didn’t hold back. She never had.</p><p>No, Rio was probably just busy. Maybe she was working a lot, or out of town. Maybe she'd caught the flu, or— <em>Stop it.</em> Agatha told herself firmly, shaking off the thought as she got her keys out. She was spiralling. Overthinking. Again.</p><p>"Aggie."</p><p>The voice cut though her thoughts like a knife. Agatha froze, her keys halfway into the lock of her front door. It couldn’t be. But when she turned, there Rio was, standing a few feet away, arms crossed, a smug grin plastered across her face.</p><p>Agatha’s heart gave a little lurch. <em>Oh God.</em></p><p>"You've been avoiding me," Rio said, her tone light but pointed.</p><p>"I haven't," Agatha protested too quickly, her voice coming out more defensive than she intended. She cursed herself silently. She wasn’t fooling anyone, least of all Rio.</p><p>"You have," Rio said, a hint of amusement in her voice, making Agatha’s pulse skip.</p><p>"I haven’t," Agatha insisted again, trying her best to sound casual. But the way Rio was looking at her—like she knew, like she could see straight through her—was making her nervous.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. The way her lips curled into that familiar smirk and her tongue poking her cheek, the action that made Agatha’s stomach do flips, only intensified the tension.</p><p>"Really? Because I haven't seen you since the party, and you're clearly trying to avoid me." She gestured to Agatha.</p><p>She opened her mouth, but no words came out. <em>Like a goldfish,</em> she thought helplessly, wanting to shrink into the ground. <em>Why does she have that effect on me all of a sudden?</em></p><p>"Listen," Rio said, her voice suddenly softer, a hint of something... almost gentle. "If you're uncomfortable with what happened, that's fine. We can just forget about it."</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, and her heart gave a little pang. Disappointment? Was that what she was hearing? She blinked rapidly, trying to shake off the strange sensation creeping into her veins.</p><p>"No, it’s not—I mean, it’s fine. I'm not—" Agatha stumbled over her words, her face burning with heat that had nothing to do with the building’s temperature.</p><p>"Right," Rio drawled, her eyes narrowing slightly, though her smirk remained. “Okay. Fine, if you’re not avoiding me, come out for drinks with me and Alice tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s grip on her keys tightened. The invitation—so casual, so easy—sent a ripple of unease through her. She opened her mouth, ready to decline on instinct, to come up with some excuse about work or an early morning, but nothing came out.</p><p>Because the way Rio was looking at her—sharp, amused, expectant—made her pulse stutter.</p><p>“I…” Agatha cleared her throat. “I don’t think I can.”</p><p>Rio hummed, tilting her head just slightly. “Busy?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“With what?”</p><p>Agatha faltered. She hadn’t prepared for a follow-up. “Things.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk deepened. “Oh, things.”</p><p>God, she was irritating.</p><p>Agatha turned back to her door, slipping her key into the lock, but her hand felt unsteady. She hated that. Hated that Rio could rattle her without even trying. And worst of all, she hated how the moment she looked at her—really looked—something in her chest went tight.</p><p>Because she hadn’t seen her in days. And it shouldn’t have mattered. But it did.</p><p>Rio was standing there in a loose-fitting black tank top, the fabric thin enough that it clung in places Agatha absolutely refused to acknowledge. Her arms were crossed, which only accentuated the toned lines of her shoulders, and she wore her confidence like a second skin. Unbothered. Unapologetic. Like she had been waiting for this moment, knowing exactly how it would play out.</p><p>A week ago, Agatha would’ve brushed past her without a second thought. But now—now, it felt different.</p><p>Because now, she had the sounds stuck in her head.</p><p>It was humiliating how easily they resurfaced, how her brain played them back without permission. The soft, breathless moans. The low, drawn-out gasps. The way Rio had sounded through the wall, unrestrained, lost in the moment.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach clenched.</p><p>She hadn’t meant to listen. Of course, she hadn’t. It had started as an unfortunate coincidence, an intrusive noise she’d tried to block out. But then… she hadn’t.</p><p>She had laid there, still and frozen, unable to escape the slow, rhythmic proof of Rio’s pleasure. And something about it had hooked into her—something that made her heart pound too fast and her breathing too shallow.</p><p>She should have left the apartment. Should have turned on music, shoved a pillow over her head, done anything to make it stop.</p><p>But she hadn’t.</p><p>And now, standing here, looking at Rio, she felt a slow, creeping heat crawl up her spine. Because Rio <em>knew</em>. She must have known. And if she hadn’t before, she certainly did now.</p><p>“Earth to Agatha,” Rio’s voice cut through the fog, lazy and teasing.</p><p>Agatha snapped back to reality, blinking hard.</p><p>Rio was watching her—really watching—her dark eyes dancing with something unspoken.</p><p>“You good?” she asked, her smirk shifting into something almost curious.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to straighten. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Rio took a step closer, and Agatha hated how instinctively she stiffened. Not out of fear, not even out of annoyance—but because <em>she felt it</em>. The closeness. The proximity that, until recently, had never meant anything at all.</p><p>Rio wasn’t touching her, not yet, but Agatha could still feel her presence pressing in—warm and confident.</p><p>"You should come,” Rio said, her voice lower now, more coaxing than demanding. “It’s just drinks. Nothing complicated. Unless…” She paused, tilting her head, her grin turning sharp. “You <em>are</em> avoiding me.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly. She knew this game. She’d seen Rio play it a hundred times before. Rio <em>liked</em> to get under her skin, to push until she cracked.</p><p>But she wasn’t going to crack.</p><p>So, she lifted her chin, levelled her with a perfectly neutral stare, and said, “Fine.”</p><p>For a second, Rio almost looked surprised. Then her grin widened, all teeth, all satisfaction.</p><p>“Great,” she said, stepping back. “I’ll text you the place and time. Don’t be late.”</p><p>And just like that, she turned on her heel, sauntering down the hall like she hadn’t just derailed Agatha’s entire day.</p><p>-</p><p>The moment Agatha stepped into the bar, she had two conflicting thoughts.</p><p>One: She should have said no. She should have made up a last-minute excuse, faked a migraine, or suddenly remembered an early morning meeting. Anything to avoid this.</p><p>And two: She actually looked <em>good</em>.</p><p>The realisation hit her like a strange, unexpected surge of confidence.</p><p>It wasn’t like she had dressed <em>for</em> Rio—obviously. That would be ridiculous. She had simply taken Lilia’s previous mocking to heart. For once, she wasn’t wrapped in the safe, stiff confines of her usual office attire. No blazer, no stiff-collared blouse, no pencil skirt that made her feel like she was about to audit someone’s taxes.</p><p>Instead, she had chosen something looser, something more comfortable. A deep emerald satin top that draped over her frame just right, the neckline low <em>but not too low</em>, tucked into high-waisted black jeans that accentuated her shape. She had even gone so far as to wear boots instead of her usual practical flats or over-the-top heels. Her makeup was minimal, just enough to make her eyes pop, and for once, her hair wasn’t in its usual no-nonsense bun.</p><p>If Lilia saw her now, she’d probably throw a celebratory toast in her honour.</p><p>That thought alone was enough to make Agatha straighten her shoulders as she crossed the room, reminding herself that this wasn’t a mistake. She could <em>do</em> this. She could have a normal night out, drink with Alice, tolerate Rio’s presence, and go home without overthinking it to death.</p><p>She had never been to this particular bar, and she knew why immediately. If the dozen pride flags fluttering from the ceiling weren’t a dead giveaway, the general ambiance certainly was. The bar was warm, lively, packed with groups of people who seemed effortlessly at ease, their laughter spilling into the hum of low music and clinking glasses. A neon sign above the bar read <strong>"GAY PANIC"</strong> in obnoxiously bright pink letters, and Agatha almost turned around and walked right back out.</p><p>Rio. Of course, this was Rio’s doing.</p><p>She forced her expression to remain neutral as she wove through the crowd, keeping her movements deliberate, steady. She wasn’t panicked. She wasn’t <em>panicking</em>. It was just a bar. A normal, crowded, <em>gay</em> bar.</p><p>It didn’t mean anything. She’s sure a lot of straight people came here. Allies.</p><p>She was an <em>ally</em>.</p><p>That thought alone made Agatha’s fingers tense at her sides as she scanned the crowd, looking for Alice. Not Rio.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Her gaze kept darting to the people around her—the easy way they leaned against the bar, the casual brushes of hands, the soft laughter exchanged between people who weren’t second-guessing themselves. It was an atmosphere Agatha had never really been part of, not like this.</p><p>She tried not to think about it. About how natural it looked. About how <em>comfortable</em> everyone seemed.</p><p>About how much she <em>wasn’t</em>.</p><p>Agatha spotted Alice near the back, already nursing a cocktail and talking to someone she didn’t recognise. She weaved through the crowd, hyperaware of the bass of the music thrumming beneath her ribs, of the warmth of the bodies she brushed past, of the fact that—</p><p>
<em>Rio is already here.</em>
</p><p>She caught sight of her before she could pretend otherwise, standing effortlessly at the bar, one elbow propped against the counter. She was deep in conversation with some woman—tall, brunette, annoyingly pretty—and Agatha hated that the first thing she noticed was the way Rio’s fingers were lazily twirling the straw in her drink.</p><p>Relaxed. At home.</p><p>Like she <em>belonged</em> here.</p><p>Agatha didn’t.</p><p>“Finally,” Alice drawled, pulling her back into reality as she plopped onto the stool beside her, her friend having disappeared. “Rio said you were coming, but I was starting to think you chickened out.”</p><p>“Please,” Agatha scoffed, shaking off whatever had just gotten into her. “My cab was late.”</p><p>Alice gave her a knowing look over the rim of her glass. “Mmm. Sure. And it had nothing to do with the fact that we’re in <em>Gay Panic</em>?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It’s a ridiculous name for a bar.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “I think it’s fitting.”</p><p>Agatha refused to acknowledge that.</p><p>A fresh drink was pushed in front of her—something dark and amber-coloured, likely Alice’s way of making sure she <em>relaxed</em>—and Agatha took a slow sip, letting the warmth settle in her chest.</p><p>She could do this.</p><p>Normal night out. Normal conversation. Normal—</p><p>“Damn, Aggie.”</p><p>Her entire body tensed before she even turned.</p><p>Rio’s voice was unmistakable, that smooth, lazy drawl laced with amusement, with <em>something else</em> she couldn’t quite place.</p><p>Agatha kept her expression neutral as she turned, raising an unimpressed eyebrow as Rio sauntered up, drink in hand, lips curled in that signature smirk.</p><p>She was still wearing that damn leather jacket, slightly worn at the seams, like it had been thrown over barstools and draped over stranger’s shoulders a thousand times before. The casual dishevelment of her loose button-down made it clear she hadn’t <em>tried</em> to look good tonight. She just <em>did</em>.</p><p>And Agatha <em>hated</em> that she noticed.</p><p>Rio’s gaze dragged over her, slow and deliberate, like she had every right to look.</p><p>Agatha felt it before she fully registered it—felt the weight of it settle over her skin, warm and heavy, like a touch that hadn’t even happened. It started at her collarbone, where the satin of her top caught the low light of the bar, then drifted downward, lingering just long enough that Agatha resisted the urge to shift under the scrutiny.</p><p>Then Rio’s eyes flicked lower, to where her blouse tucked neatly into her jeans, to the way the high waist accentuated her frame. A brief pause, an almost imperceptible twitch of her lips, before her gaze travelled back up with the same unhurried ease.</p><p>Unbothered. Unapologetic.</p><p>Like she was <em>enjoying</em> this.</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, willing herself not to react.</p><p>She wasn’t going to acknowledge it. She wasn’t going to give Rio the satisfaction of a reaction.</p><p>But her fingers twitched slightly against her glass, grip tightening around the condensation-slick surface.</p><p>Rio noticed. Of course, she noticed, and her smirk deepened.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked, tone clipped, forcing herself to take another sip of her drink.</p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, just enough that Agatha caught the faint scent of her cologne—something sharp, clean, with an edge of something warmer. It was <em>unfair</em>, how effortlessly she did this, how she always managed to settle into her space like she belonged there.</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said, voice smooth, easy. But the amusement in her eyes told another story.</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, and she heard Alice snort into her drink.</p><p>She was enjoying this <em>way</em> too much.</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to look at her to know she was grinning, practically vibrating with barely contained amusement.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t amused. She was <em>irritated</em>.</p><p>Irritated that Rio was standing so close. Irritated that her presence was <em>tangible</em>, like static in the air, sparking against Agatha’s skin. Irritated that she smelled good. Irritated that her gaze had <em>felt</em> like something when it traced down her body.</p><p>And mostly, she was irritated that she was letting it get to her.</p><p>She set her drink down with more force than necessary. “So you’re just going to stand here and stare, then?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, as if considering it. “Maybe.”</p><p>Alice let out a <em>low</em> whistle, muffled slightly by the rim of her glass.</p><p>Agatha shot her a sharp look, but Alice just sipped, all wide-eyed innocence.</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, leaned against the high-top table, completely at ease. “I mean, what else am I supposed to do when you walk in here looking like <em>that</em>?”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted.</p><p>Like <em>that</em>.</p><p>Like it was something intentional. Like she had <em>wanted</em> to be looked at. Like she had <em>wanted</em> Rio to notice. Did she?</p><p>She scoffed. “You act like I showed up in a ballgown.”</p><p>“No, nothing that dramatic.” Rio’s smirk softened into something more knowing, something almost lazy as she took a sip of her drink. “But this is new.”</p><p>Agatha tensed.</p><p>She shouldn’t have. There was nothing wrong with switching up her wardrobe, nothing wrong with showing up to a bar in something that didn’t scream <em>PowerPoint presentations and high blood pressure</em>.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>The way Rio said it—soft, slow, like she was <em>cataloguing</em>—made her feel exposed.</p><p>Alice set her glass down with a clink. “I think what she <em>means</em> to say is that you look hot.”</p><p>Agatha <em>glared</em> at her. “That’s not what she means.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s <em>exactly</em> what I mean,” Rio said, grin widening.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, just slightly.</p><p>Alice outright cackled, shoving Agatha’s arm. “See? <em>Progress!</em>”</p><p>Agatha turned back to Rio, expression carefully blank. “Are you done?”</p><p>Rio took a slow sip of her drink, gaze still locked on her over the rim. She swallowed, set the glass down, and let the silence stretch <em>just</em> long enough to make it deliberate.</p><p>Then, finally, she said, “Not even close.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, exhaling slowly through her nose and rolling her eyes.</p><p>She should have stayed home.</p><p>Agatha willed herself to stay unbothered, <em>neutral</em>. She refused to let Rio—or Alice, for that matter—get under her skin any more than they already had.</p><p>She straightened, picked up her glass, and took a deliberate sip. “So,” she said, pointedly steering the conversation away from herself. “Are we actually going to talk about something, or are you two just going to spend the entire night making me regret my choices?”</p><p>Alice grinned, unrepentant. “Depends. Are you regretting them?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha lied smoothly.</p><p>Rio chuckled, low and amused. “Shame. I was enjoying myself.”</p><p>Agatha ignored that.</p><p>Alice, mercifully, decided to shift gears. “Alright, alright. Fine. Since we’re actually here to <em>socialise</em>, we should at least pretend to mingle.”</p><p>“Mingle?” Agatha repeated, skeptical.</p><p>Alice nodded toward the bar, where clusters of people stood in loose, easy circles, leaning into each other’s space, laughing, talking—<em>flirting</em>.</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to bristle.</p><p>“Some of us,” Alice continued, “have <em>needs</em>, Agatha. And this bar happens to be <em>crawling</em> with opportunity.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “So what, you dragged me here so I could watch you seduce people?”</p><p>Alice smirked. “I dragged you here so you could <em>live a little</em>.”</p><p>Agatha let out a slow, measured breath. She was <em>living</em>. She was <em>here</em>, wasn’t she? She was <em>participating</em>.</p><p>“Right,” she said, draining the last of her drink and pushing back from the table. “Well, if we’re all so committed to this social experiment, I’ll get the next round.”</p><p>She didn’t wait for a response before turning on her heel and making her way toward the bar.</p><p>She told herself she wasn’t escaping.</p><p>Because she <em>wasn’t</em>.</p><p>-</p><p>The bar was crowded, but not overwhelming. The bartender was fast, efficient, sliding drinks across the counter with practiced ease. Agatha found a space near the end, waiting for her turn, keeping her movements measured, her breathing even.</p><p>She was fine.</p><p>This was fine.</p><p>She had been <em>checked out</em> before. It wasn’t a big deal. Rio was just—Rio was <em>always</em> like that. It didn’t <em>mean</em> anything.</p><p>So why was her skin still warm?</p><p>Before she could spiral any further, a voice cut in from beside her.</p><p>“You here alone?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, turning.</p><p>The woman was tall, striking, with short dark hair and sharp features. She was leaning against the bar, confidence radiating from her like heat, a glass of whiskey resting in one hand.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but nothing came out at first.</p><p>Then, finally: “No.”</p><p>The woman’s lips quirked up in amusement. “That was fast.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a small, incredulous laugh before shaking her head. “I mean—no, I’m here with friends.”</p><p>The woman nodded, considering her for a moment, then extended a hand. “Elena.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then took it. “Agatha.”</p><p>Elena’s fingers were warm, her grip steady but not overpowering. When she pulled away, she let her gaze sweep over Agatha—not as slow or deliberate as Rio’s but still <em>assessing</em>.</p><p>“You don’t look like you come here often,” Elena said, taking a sip of her drink.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “What does that mean?”</p><p>Elena smirked. “It means you look like someone who got talked into it.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a short laugh, shaking her head. “That obvious?”</p><p>Elena hummed. “A little. But you wear it well.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched slightly against the bar.</p><p>She was used to being spoken to with polite indifference, with professional detachment, with the occasional empty flattery at office parties or networking events.</p><p>This was different. Direct and intentional.</p><p>It made her pulse jump in a way she wasn’t sure how to categorise.</p><p>Before she could overanalyse it, the bartender slid her drinks across the bar.</p><p>She reached for them automatically. “Well,” she said, clearing her throat. “It was nice meeting you, but I should—”</p><p>“No rush,” Elena interrupted smoothly, hr head tipping to the side slightly. “Unless you’re running from something.”</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>The words weren’t meant as a challenge, but something about them <em>felt</em> like one.</p><p>She forced a neutral expression, her hands still around the glasses. “I’m not.”</p><p>Before Elena could respond, a familiar presence slid into the space beside Agatha, warm and uninvited.</p><p><em>"There you are,"</em> Rio said smoothly, her voice settling over Agatha like a slow drawl.</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened around the glasses.</p><p>She turned her head just enough to catch Rio’s expression—sharp, amused, but with something else simmering beneath the surface.</p><p>She was close. Closer than she needed to be, her shoulder brushing against Agatha’s. The scent of her cologne, leather and sandalwood, wrapped around her like an inevitability.</p><p>Elena arched an eyebrow, shifting her gaze between the two of them, clearly assessing the sudden intrusion. “And <em>you</em> are?”</p><p>Rio smiled, easy and unreadable. “<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>No further explanation. Just the name, like it should be <em>enough</em>.</p><p>Elena hummed, unimpressed but unbothered. “Well, <em>Rio</em>, Agatha and I were in the middle of something.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s gaze flick toward her, lingering, heavy.</p><p>“Were you?” Rio mused, her voice light but deliberate.</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, resisting the urge to react.</p><p>Because she <em>felt</em> it now, felt what this was.</p><p>Jealousy.</p><p>Rio was <em>jealous</em>.</p><p>The realisation sent a strange pulse through her—equal parts frustration and something she wasn’t ready to name but was becoming a very constant feeling when she was in the vicinity of Rio.</p><p>“Right,” Agatha said, turning fully toward Rio, finally meeting her eyes. “And now you’re… what? Checking in?”</p><p>Rio smirked, tipping her empty glass toward her in a casual gesture before placing it down on the bar, leaning further into Agatha’s space. “Something like that.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</p><p>She was <em>fine</em>. She was <em>talking</em> to someone, having a normal conversation, minding her own business. But Rio had seen—had <em>noticed</em>—and instead of staying at the table, she had gotten up and come over like she had <em>some kind of claim</em>.</p><p>The worst part?</p><p>Agatha didn’t hate it.</p><p>She should. She <em>definitely</em> should.</p><p>But instead, she was standing here, skin warm, breath slightly uneven, watching Rio throw barely-veiled barbs at Elena, who was still watching the two of them like she had just stumbled into something far more interesting than she expected.</p><p>Elena’s smirk didn’t waver as she looked at Agatha. “Well, I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes,” she said, the amusement in her voice unmistakable. “Maybe I’ll see you around, Agatha.”</p><p>And with that, she raised her glass, gave Rio a once-over that was more entertained than anything else, and walked off.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realised she was holding, then turned back to Rio, eyes narrowing. “<em>Seriously?</em>”</p><p>Rio looked at her with barely concealed amusement. “What?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “You <em>know what</em>.”</p><p>Rio just grinned, leaning in slightly, her voice dropping low enough that Agatha felt it in her spine.</p><p>“Relax, Aggie,” she murmured, all amusement and arrogance.</p><p>Agatha <em>wanted</em> to roll her eyes. She <em>wanted</em> to shove the drinks at her and stalk off.</p><p>But her pulse was still off-rhythm, her stomach still tight with something suspiciously close to <em>thrill</em>, and Rio’s smirk was still entirely too <em>pleased</em>.</p><p>So instead, she exhaled sharply, handed Rio her drink, and muttered, “here.”</p><p>Rio clinked her new glass against Agatha’s before taking a sip.</p><p>“Thanks,” she said, flashing that damn smile again.</p><p>And just like that, she turned, sauntering back toward the table, completely self-satisfied.</p><p>Agatha stared after her for a beat longer than she should have, then downed half her drink in one go.</p><p>
<em>She should have let Elena keep flirting with her.</em>
</p><p>Just to see what Rio would’ve done.</p><p>-</p><p>By the time Agatha made it back to the table, Alice was already smirking.</p><p>She had <em>definitely</em> seen what had just happened.</p><p>Agatha set the drinks down with a little more force than necessary, ignoring the way Rio slid into her seat like she hadn’t just <em>inserted herself</em> into a conversation that had absolutely nothing to do with her.</p><p>Alice leaned forward, resting her chin in her hand. “Soooo,” she drawled. “How was your little bar side rendezvous?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare. “Do <em>not</em> start.”</p><p>Rio, of course, looked <em>pleased</em> with herself. She took a slow sip of her drink, utterly at ease, as if she hadn’t just <em>blatantly</em> interrupted a perfectly normal interaction.</p><p>Alice let out a small, knowing hum, eyes twinkling. “Well, that’s fine. You don’t have to tell me anything.” She leaned back in her seat, scanning the room. “I’ll just assume <em>everything</em> based on the fact that you’re still gripping your glass like you want to throw it at someone.”</p><p>Agatha huffed through her nose and loosened her grip. She was <em>not</em> going to let Rio get to her.</p><p>But then Alice’s gaze flicked past them, and her entire demeanour shifted. Her spine straightened, her eyes widened slightly, and a slow grin curled at the edges of her lips.</p><p>“Oh,” she murmured, gaze locking onto something—or rather, <em>someone</em>—across the room.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even have time to ask before Alice stood abruptly, smoothing her hands down her jeans. “Well. I have suddenly found <em>something</em> infinitely more interesting than sitting here watching you two eye-fuck each other.”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her drink. “<em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>“What?” Alice grinned, already stepping back from the table.</p><p>Agatha shot her a look as she heard Rio chuckling beside her.</p><p>Alice winked at them both, then waved a lazy hand as she strolled off, disappearing into the crowd.</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Of <em>course</em> she would ditch them.</p><p>Now, she was stuck here. Alone. With <em>Rio</em>.</p><p>She risked a glance at her, and—yep. That smug little smirk was still there.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, setting her drink down. “You look entirely too pleased.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, and retorted, “And you look entirely too tense.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth—<em>to argue, to deflect, to say something biting</em>—but then someone bumped into her from behind.</p><p>It wasn’t a hard shove, just the careless jostling of a crowded bar, but it sent her off balance—just enough that she instinctively reached out.</p><p>Her hand landed on Rio’s thigh.</p><p>Warm. Solid. Unmistakable.</p><p>For a split second, neither of them moved.</p><p>Agatha could <em>feel</em> the way Rio tensed under her touch, how her smirk faltered, just slightly. She could feel the slight shift in Rio’s breathing, how her eyes darkened—not playful, not teasing, just <em>something else</em>.</p><p>Something <em>charged</em>.</p><p>Agatha should have pulled away. Immediately.</p><p>But for some reason—some utterly stupid, reckless reason—she didn’t.</p><p>Not right away.</p><p>Instead, she felt the heat of Rio’s skin through the denim, the way the muscle beneath her palm flexed ever so slightly, like she had caught Rio <em>off guard</em>.</p><p>Which was rare.</p><p>Which was… exciting?</p><p>Her fingers twitched, just barely, before she finally yanked her hand back, clearing her throat.</p><p>Rio let out a slow breath, a low chuckle slipping from her lips. “Careful, Aggie,” she murmured, her voice lower than before. “I might start thinking you <em>like</em> touching me.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, willing her face to stay neutral. “You were in my way.”</p><p>Rio hummed, unconvinced. “Right.”</p><p>Agatha picked up her drink again, swallowing a long sip, ignoring the way her fingers <em>still</em> felt warm.</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair, studying her, that smirk creeping back into place. But there was something different in her eyes now—something almost <em>curious</em>.</p><p>Agatha refused to look at her.</p><p>Instead she focused on her drink, willing her pulse to settle. She wasn’t flustered. She <em>refused</em> to be flustered.</p><p>Rio hadn’t moved much since the accidental touch, but she was watching her now—not with that usual smirk, not with the same teasing glint in her eyes. This was something slower, something more unreadable, and Agatha felt it like a physical sensation.</p><p>Then, after a beat, Rio said, “So.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, tilting her head just enough to look at her. “So?”</p><p>Rio swirled the ice in her glass, taking her time. “How do you like the bar?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. The question was <em>almost</em> normal. Almost <em>too</em> normal.</p><p>She hesitated before answering, glancing around the room. The energy was the same as when she walked in—warm, lively, unpretentious. The music thrummed low, conversations hummed around her, and people moved easily in and out of each other’s spaces without second-guessing it.</p><p>It was <em>comfortable</em>.</p><p>Or at least, it should have been.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, finally answering, “It’s… fine.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her lips quirking like she was waiting for something more.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Alright, fine. Apart from feeling slightly out of place, it’s nice.”</p><p>Rio took a slow sip of her drink. “Out of place?”</p><p>Agatha made a vague gesture. “You know. Since I’m not…” She trailed off, pressing her lips together for a second before finishing, “Gay.”</p><p>She didn’t know why she felt the need to <em>say</em> it, to clarify it out loud. It wasn’t like Rio didn’t <em>know</em> that already.</p><p>Rio studied her for a long moment, her expression unreadable. “Right,” she said finally, drawing out the word like she was turning it over in her mind.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, setting her glass down with a soft clink. “Nothing. Just interesting, is all.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “How is that interesting?”</p><p>Rio’s smirk was slow, deliberate. “No reason.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and rolled her eyes, her attention going back to the condensation on her glass and pointedly not at Rio.</p><p>Rio chuckled, tilting her head slightly as she considered her. “So, apart from your little identity crisis, you’re having a good time?”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her drink. “<em>I’m not having a crisis.</em>”</p><p>Rio didn’t <em>say</em> anything, just arched an infuriating eyebrow.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply. “I am <em>perfectly</em> comfortable in my identity.”</p><p>Rio hummed, unconvinced. “Mmhmm.”</p><p>Agatha glared. “I <em>am</em>.”</p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, her voice dropping just enough to be dangerous. “Then why do you look like you’re trying so hard to convince yourself of that?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t <em>have</em> to respond.</p><p>She could have just let the words settle between them, let the conversation dissolve into something safer, something <em>less</em>.</p><p>But the weight of Rio’s gaze made it impossible to ignore.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, exhaling slowly through her nose. She wasn’t <em>uncomfortable</em>, exactly. Just… <em>aware</em>.</p><p>Aware of Rio.</p><p>Aware of the way the energy between them had shifted—less teasing, more <em>pointed</em>. More deliberate.</p><p>She hated that Rio could do that. That she could needle her way into Agatha’s mind so effortlessly, push <em>just enough</em> to leave her overthinking every damn word.</p><p>Rio must have noticed, because her expression flickered—just for a second, just long enough that Agatha saw it. A brief pause, like she was <em>recalculating</em>.</p><p>Then, suddenly, Rio leaned back, finishing the last sip of her drink. “You know,” she said, tone lighter now, easy, “we could keep sitting here while you glare at me like you’re plotting my murder.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, cutting in. “Tempting.”</p><p>“Or” Rio continued, unfazed, “we could dance.”</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>The music pulsed low through the room, something upbeat, something rhythmic. She hadn’t been paying attention to it before, but now she was <em>acutely</em> aware of the space around them—the way people had slowly migrated to the open floor near the back, bodies moving together in easy, effortless motion.</p><p>She scoffed. “<em>Dance?</em>”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Yeah. You know that thing people do when they hear music?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a flat look. “I know what dancing <em>is</em>.”</p><p>“Great.” Rio grinned, already pushing herself up from her seat. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp, incredulous laugh. “Absolutely <em>not</em>.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Why not?”</p><p>Agatha gestured vaguely. “Because—I don’t dance.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow. “You <em>don’t dance</em>?”</p><p>“Not in public.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “So you <em>do</em> dance.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, already regretting this. “That’s not—”</p><p>“Come on, Aggie.” Rio extended a hand, wiggling her fingers in invitation. “Just one song.”</p><p>Agatha eyed her warily. “Why do I feel like this is a trap?”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled. “Because you’re paranoid.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, shaking her head. “No.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move, didn’t withdraw her hand. “One dance,” she repeated, coaxing. “Then you can go back to sitting here, overanalysing everything I say.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare, but Rio just waited, effortlessly patient, her hand still outstretched.</p><p>The worst part?</p><p>Agatha could feel herself wavering.</p><p>She could hear Alice’s voice in the back of her mind, telling her to <em>live a little</em>.</p><p>And—fine.</p><p>One dance.</p><p>What was the worst that could happen?</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, giving Rio one last suspicious glance before—without fully thinking it through—she slipped her hand into hers.</p><p>The contact was immediate, warm.</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled around hers with ease, like it was the most natural thing in the world, and before Agatha could second-guess it, Rio tugged her forward, leading her toward the dance floor with <em>far</em> too much confidence.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to process what she’d just done before they were in the middle of it—surrounded by movement, by heat, by the rhythmic thrum of bass that seemed to pulse through the floor.</p><p>She was <em>doing this</em>.</p><p>She was <em>actually</em> doing this.</p><p>And—somehow—she wasn’t <em>dreading</em> it.</p><p>The first song was fast, easy, nothing too serious. Rio moved effortlessly, like she’d been built for this, like she <em>belonged</em> in places like this. Agatha, on the other hand, felt stiff at first, too aware of herself, too aware of the way Rio was <em>watching</em> her, like she was waiting for her to loosen up.</p><p>But then—she did.</p><p>Somewhere between one song and the next, the tension in her shoulders eased, the self-consciousness faded, and she started moving without <em>thinking</em> about it.</p><p>And—it was fun.</p><p>More than fun.</p><p>It was <em>freeing</em>.</p><p>She let herself get lost in it, let herself enjoy the way the music pulsed through her, let herself match Rio’s movements without analysing it to death.</p><p>She was laughing, actually <em>laughing</em>, and Rio grinned like she had just won something.</p><p>Another song bled into the next, and then another, and before Agatha even realised it, they had been dancing for <em>much longer</em> than one song.</p><p>She didn’t care.</p><p>Not right now.</p><p>Not when Rio was spinning her playfully, not when the energy between them felt <em>light</em> for once, not when—</p><p>The music shifted.</p><p>The upbeat rhythm melted into something slower. Deeper.</p><p>More sensual.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>The mood around them changed instantly. The space between bodies became <em>less</em>, the movements more languid, more <em>deliberate</em>.</p><p>She <em>should</em> step back.</p><p>She <em>should</em> turn around and walk back to the table, reclaiming the distance that had already been dangerously thin between them.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Because Rio was still there.</p><p>Still watching her.</p><p>And <em>she</em> wasn’t stepping back either.</p><p>If anything, she was closer now, her body moving with easy confidence, rolling with the shift in tempo like she’d <em>expected</em> it.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her pulse ticking faster as Rio leaned in slightly, just enough that their movements synced without effort.</p><p>Not touching.</p><p>Not <em>really</em>.</p><p>But close enough that Agatha could <em>feel</em> it.</p><p>Feel the pull, the weight of something she couldn’t pinpoint, between them.</p><p>Her fingers twitched at her sides, resisting the instinct to reach for something, to ground herself.</p><p>And Rio noticed.</p><p>Of course, she noticed. Because she noticed <em>everything.</em></p><p>And the look in her eyes—lazy, knowing, <em>intentional</em>—made Agatha’s stomach flip.</p><p>She had two choices.</p><p>Step away.</p><p>Or see where this went.</p><p>She <em>should</em> step away.</p><p>But for some reason—some <em>reckless, stupid</em> reason—she didn’t.</p><p>Instead, she stepped forward.</p><p>Not much. Just enough.</p><p>Just enough for the space between them to dissolve, for the heat of Rio’s body to become something tangible.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched—small, almost imperceptible—but Agatha <em>felt</em> it.</p><p>Felt the way the shift in proximity changed everything.</p><p>Because now, they were <em>dancing</em>. Not just moving near each other, not just caught in the sway of the crowd.</p><p>Dancing.</p><p>Rio recovered quickly—of course she did. Her hands found Agatha’s waist like it was second nature, settling there without hesitation. Warm, grounding.</p><p>And Agatha let her.</p><p>Her breath came shallow, but she didn’t pull away. Didn’t step back.</p><p>She let herself move with Rio, let herself follow the slow rhythm that pulsed through them, let herself <em>feel</em> what it was like to be this close, to be looked at like this.</p><p>Like Rio <em>knew</em> something she didn’t.</p><p>Agatha’s hands hovered—uncertain, hesitant—before finally wrapping around Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>Rio smirked, the corner of her mouth twitching. “Didn’t take you for the bold type, Aggie.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers flexed slightly against the fabric of Rio’s shirt. “Shut up.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, but it was quieter now, softer. Like she didn’t want to break whatever moment they’d just stumbled into.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse thudded in her throat, but she didn’t retreat.</p><p>She let Rio guide her, let her body move on instinct, let herself <em>exist</em> in this moment without analysing it to death.</p><p>And for a second—for one reckless, heart-thudding second—she wasn’t thinking about what it <em>meant</em>.</p><p>She was just <em>there</em>.</p><p>Moving.</p><p>Breathing.</p><p>Feeling.</p><p>Rio’s grip tightened just slightly, fingers pressing in, her gaze flickering down to Agatha’s lips before snapping back up, quick as a spark.</p><p>Agatha saw it.</p><p>Felt it.</p><p>And—God—she <em>liked</em> it.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, wrapped up in something they weren’t naming, something that felt <em>dangerous</em> in a way she wasn’t ready to admit.</p><p>But then—</p><p>“<em>Oh my God,</em>” Alice’s voice <em>pierced</em> through the moment.</p><p>Agatha jumped, Rio’s hands dropping from her waist as they both turned sharply to find Alice standing a few feet away, gaping at them.</p><p>“I leave you alone for five minutes,” Alice gasped, eyes darting between them, “and you’re already in a <em>romance movie montage</em>?”</p><p>Agatha stepped back. Too fast. Too sharp.</p><p>Reality crashed in all at once, slamming into her like a tidal wave.</p><p>Rio—ever the picture of unbothered confidence—just ran a hand through her hair, exhaling a laugh. “Alice, you have <em>terrible</em> timing.”</p><p>Alice beamed, delighted. “Oh, I <em>absolutely</em> don’t.”</p><p>Agatha needed another drink.</p><p>Immediately.</p>

<p>The night had blurred into a haze of warmth and laughter and alcohol.</p><p>Somewhere between the second and third drink, Agatha had <em>relaxed</em>.</p><p>Somewhere between the third and fourth, she had stopped overthinking.</p><p>And somewhere between the fourth and <em>whatever number she was on now</em>, she had completely lost the ability to ignore the fact that Rio was so. fucking. hot.</p><p>It wasn’t fair.</p><p>It <em>wasn’t fair</em>.</p><p>Because Rio had <em>always</em> been attractive. That was just a fact, an unchangeable, irritating truth of the universe. But <em>tonight</em>—tonight, it was <em>impossible</em>.</p><p>Maybe it was the dim lighting of the bar, the way it caught in the angles of her jaw, in the teasing glint of her eyes.</p><p>Maybe it was the way she carried herself, all loose confidence, all self-assured charm, like she knew exactly what kind of effect she had on people.</p><p>Or maybe—maybe it was <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p>Maybe it was the fact that she was drunk enough that every line she had drawn between them—every carefully crafted boundary, every logical explanation—was starting to feel paper thin.</p><p>She was leaning against the high-top table, her elbow propped up as she swirled what was left of her drink, barely listening to Alice talking about something.</p><p>Because all she could <em>think</em> about was Rio.</p><p>Rio, sitting next to her, stupidly close, the scent of her cologne weaving into Agatha’s brain like a permanent brand.</p><p>Rio, laughing at something Alice had said, her head tilting back, exposing the sharp line of her throat.</p><p>Rio, leaning in slightly—too slightly, too easily—to steal a sip from Agatha’s drink, not even asking, just smirking against the rim of the glass.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>She was so fucked.</p><p>Because her brain was spiralling, spinning <em>wildly</em> off course, down a dangerous road she wasn’t prepared to navigate.</p><p>
<em>Her straight brain.</em>
</p><p>Her <em>straight</em> brain, which had always been <em>so sure</em> of itself, was <em>glitching.</em></p><p>Because Rio was too close, and Agatha was too drunk, and suddenly, the idea of not reaching out, of not touching her, of not leaning in and closing the tiny, tiny space between them—</p><p>It felt <em>impossible</em>.</p><p>Her fingers twitched against her glass.</p><p>She shouldn’t.</p><p>She <em>shouldn’t</em>.</p><p>But she didn’t know if she could stop herself.</p><p>She needed air.</p><p>Or water.</p><p>Or maybe to be physically <em>removed</em> from this situation before she did something catastrophic.</p><p>Because her brain was not working.</p><p>Not when Rio was <em>still</em> sitting too close, her arm casually draped over the back of Agatha’s chair, her fingers so close to skimming her shoulder.</p><p>Not when she could <em>feel</em> the heat of her presence like a slow burn licking at her skin.</p><p>Not when every single one of her usually well-functioning thoughts had been replaced with one singular, all-consuming realisation. <em>She wanted to kiss her.</em></p><p>Her stomach plummeted.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>She was <em>drunk</em>. That was the only explanation. This was the alcohol talking, some weird, intoxicated malfunction in her brain that would <em>absolutely</em> correct itself by morning.</p><p>Except—</p><p>Except Rio turned to her then, mid-laugh, eyes glinting as she nudged Agatha’s knee with her own.</p><p>Casual. Effortless.</p><p>But Agatha felt it everywhere.</p><p>She inhaled sharply, too sharply, and Rio’s gaze flickered, just for a second, like she’d noticed.</p><p>Abort. Abort.</p><p>She needed a distraction. A reason to get up, move, do literally anything other than sit here and lose her fucking mind over how Rio’s mouth looked when she smiled. When she spoke.</p><p>She turned, about to ask Alice something—anything—but Alice was gone.</p><p>That realisation hit her like a slap.</p><p>She must have left. Or disappeared into the crowd. Or—</p><p>Oh, God. She was alone with Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened around her glass as her heart pounded against her ribs.</p><p>She had to go.</p><p>She had to say something normal, something <em>casual</em>, something that didn’t immediately expose the fact that she was currently in the middle of a sexuality crisis that had hit her like a goddamn trainwreck—</p><p>“I think I need to kiss you,” she blurted.</p><p>Her entire body locked up, her brain immediately short-circuiting, screaming at her, <em>WHY THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY THAT OUT LOUD?!</em></p><p>Rio went completely still.</p><p>The bar was still loud, the music still thrumming, the laughter and clinking glasses still filling the space around them—</p><p>But Agatha’s entire world shrunk down to the silence that fell between them.</p><p>She could feel Rio staring at her, could <em>feel</em> the exact moment that smirk she always wore slowly began to morph into something else.</p><p>Something dangerous.</p><p>Agatha wanted to <em>die</em>.</p><p>She wanted to <em>take the words back, shove them back into her mouth, rewind time, erase the last five seconds from existence</em>.</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>Slow. Deliberate.</p><p>Like she was making sure she had actually heard what she thought she had.</p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, was malfunctioning.</p><p>Her brain had completely shut down, leaving her physically incapable of doing anything except sitting there, frozen, absolutely horrified by the words that had just left her mouth.</p><p>She hadn’t <em>meant</em> to say it.</p><p>It wasn’t <em>planned</em>.</p><p>It had just—escaped, flung itself into the universe like a reckless, nuclear bomb of a confession with zero warning.</p><p>Rio’s lips parted slightly, her brows lifting just enough to show shock, which was rare. Rio was never shocked. Rio was <em>always</em> in control.</p><p>But right now?</p><p>Right now, Agatha had stunned her into silence.</p><p>And that was possibly the most terrifying part of all.</p><p>The pause stretched too long, too heavy, too much, and Agatha’s flight response kicked in at full force.</p><p>“I—” she started, voice barely working, scrambling for an explanation, an escape, <em>anything</em>. “That wasn’t— I didn’t mean—”</p><p>“Didn’t mean it?” Rio finally spoke, cutting her off, voice slow, lazy, like she was tasting the words.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach flipped violently.</p><p>Because Rio’s expression was changing.</p><p>The shock was gone now, replaced with something else.</p><p>Something intentional.</p><p>Something coiled and ready.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, hard, her breath unsteady. “I meant—I meant I need <em>air</em>.”</p><p>Rio smirked, tilting her head slightly. “That’s not what you said.”</p><p>“I <em>meant</em> to say that” Agatha lied terribly, barely holding onto any dignity at this point.</p><p>Rio exhaled a laugh, quiet, amused. “Mmm.”</p><p>Agatha could feel herself unravelling, losing control, falling into something she didn’t understand.</p><p>She had to go.</p><p>She had to leave.</p><p>She had to—</p><p>Rio shifted.</p><p>And suddenly, the world narrowed.</p><p>Because Rio wasn’t sitting anymore.</p><p>Rio was closer now, leaning in, one arm bracing against the table, her body angled just enough that Agatha felt trapped.</p><p>Not in a bad way.</p><p>In a way that sent heat rushing down her spine like wildfire.</p><p>She stopped breathing.</p><p>Because Rio was looking at her mouth now.</p><p>Just for a second.</p><p>Just long enough for Agatha’s entire world to shatter into pieces.</p><p>Then—</p><p>Rio’s voice dropped lower, softer.</p><p>“Do you?”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse pounded in her ears.</p><p>“I—”</p><p>Rio’s fingers ghosted along the edge of Agatha’s chair, casual, but completely ruining her ability to think.</p><p>“You said you <em>needed</em> to kiss me. <em>Do you?”</em></p><p>Agatha’s heart was slamming against her ribs, her breath caught somewhere in her throat.</p><p>“I was drunk when I said that” she managed to whisper, barely.</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched, eyes glinting.</p><p>“You’re <em>still</em> drunk,” she pointed out.</p><p>Agatha was going to die.</p><p>This was it. This was the end.</p><p>“I—”</p><p>She couldn’t do this.</p><p>She couldn’t.</p><p>Because if she let this happen, if she leaned in, if she gave in—</p><p>She didn’t know if she could ever come back from it.</p><p>Agatha knew she would regret this.</p><p>She knew it in the same way she knew drinking on an empty stomach was a bad idea. In the same way she knew she would hate herself in the morning when the hangover kicked in and her brain had fully rebooted.</p><p>But right now?</p><p>Right now, her drunk-addled brain didn’t care.</p><p>Because Rio was right there.</p><p>Because Rio was close, her lips just parted, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin, her eyes dark with something unreadable, something inviting.</p><p>And suddenly, the idea of not kissing her felt stupid.</p><p>So Agatha did the intelligent thing.</p><p>She closed the distance.</p><p>She didn’t hesitate. Didn’t give herself time to think, to panic, to <em>stop herself</em> from doing something she couldn’t take back.</p><p>She just leaned in and kissed her.</p><p>And—</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio made a soft, surprised sound against her lips—something low, something fleeting—but she didn’t pull away.</p><p>If anything, she leaned into it, like she’d been waiting.</p><p>Like she’d known this was coming all along.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse pounded, her fingers curling into the fabric of Rio’s jacket before she could stop herself.</p><p>It wasn’t gentle.</p><p>It wasn’t soft or careful.</p><p>It was hot, <em>frantic</em>, messy in the way that only bad decisions made at 1am could be.</p><p>Rio’s hands found her waist, gripping, her fingers pressing into Agatha’s skin through her top, like she was steadying her, grounding her, holding her in place.</p><p>Agatha’s heart was hammering, her mind spiralling, her entire world narrowing to just this—just Rio, just the heat of her, the taste of whiskey, the way she kissed like she knew exactly how to undo her.</p><p>And the worst part?</p><p>She was good at it.</p><p>
<em>Of course she was.</em>
</p><p>Of course Rio kissed like this.</p><p>Like she knew exactly how to make Agatha’s brain turn off completely, how to make her body react before she could even process it, how to make her forget that she was going to regret this the second it was over.</p><p>But it wasn’t over yet.</p><p>And Agatha—drunk, reckless, completely gone for it now—didn’t want it to be.</p><p>The kiss was electric.</p><p>Messy. Dizzying. Overwhelming in a way that made Agatha’s head spin, whether from the alcohol or from the way Rio’s hands had tightened at her waist.</p><p>Agatha was drunk.</p><p>
<em>So fucking drunk.</em>
</p><p>Her limbs felt heavy, her head light, the world around them slightly blurred at the edges, like nothing existed outside of this moment, this heat, this sharp, unbearable need.</p><p>She knew she was leaning too much into Rio, her balance tipping slightly off-kilter, but she didn’t care.</p><p>Because Rio caught her.</p><p>Her hands slid from Agatha’s waist to her hips, steadying, tethering her in place like she had expected this. Like she knew Agatha was coming undone and had no intention of letting her go just yet.</p><p>A small, muffled sound escaped from the back of Agatha’s throat before she could stop it, and Rio responded immediately—her fingers tightening, her lips parting, her body shifting slightly until Agatha could feel the full, firm press of her against her own.</p><p>Oh. Oh, fuck.</p><p>Agatha’s head spun harder, the alcohol crashing through her like a wave, making her grip harder at Rio’s jacket for stability, for something to hold onto, for something real in a moment that felt too much like a dream.</p><p>Rio chuckled against her mouth, low, deep, satisfied, like she could feel the way Agatha was falling apart, and it was entertaining her.</p><p>
<em>Smug.</em>
</p><p>The realisation sent a sharp flare of frustration through Agatha’s already muddled thoughts, and she tilted her head, deepening the kiss, pressing harder, as if she could wipe that self-satisfied smirk off of Rio’s lips entirely.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched—barely, just a flicker—but Agatha felt it.</p><p>Felt the moment Rio lost her footing just a little, lost her control just enough to kiss her back like she actually wanted it, like this wasn’t just a game, like Agatha wasn’t just a passing tease, but something she needed.</p><p>And that—</p><p>That made everything worse.</p><p>Because Agatha was drunk.</p><p>And her brain was short-circuiting.</p><p>And everything felt too good, too hot, too much, too slippery and dangerous and uncontrollable.</p><p>She pulled back slightly, gasping, lightheaded, her vision swimming for a second before she felt Rio’s fingers tangle in the fabric of her top, keeping her close, steadying her without even thinking about it.</p><p>Her head lulled slightly, her forehead nearly brushing against Rio’s as she struggled to regain her bearings, her breath, her fucking sanity.</p><p>Rio chuckled again, but this time it was lower, breathier, her voice thick with something that hadn’t been there before.</p><p>“Aggie,” she murmured, her fingers still curled into her waist, still holding her upright, still so fucking warm.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat dry, her pulse pounding in her ears.</p><p>She needed to stop.</p><p>But she didn’t know if she could.</p><p>Because Rio was right there, and Agatha was too dizzy, too drunk, too fucking weak to pull away when Rio’s lips were still so close, and her body was so warm, and everything felt like it was slipping through her fingers too fast to catch.</p><p>She swayed slightly, her balance failing her again, and Rio’s grip tightened immediately, her hands sliding lower, firmer, anchoring Agatha’s body against hers in a way that made her breath falter entirely.</p><p>Agatha whimpered.</p><p>A soft, drunken, helpless sound she hadn’t meant to make, one that gave her away completely, and Rio felt it, heard it, reacted to it instantly—</p><p>A sharp inhale.</p><p>A barely restrained noise at the back of her throat.</p><p>A shift—so small, so subtle, but so fucking intentional—as if Rio had just made a decision.</p><p>One that Agatha wasn’t ready for.</p><p>One that she wasn’t sure she could resist.</p><p>Agatha’s head spun dangerously, the weight of the alcohol crashing down on her all at once.</p><p>She felt dizzy, her breath uneven as she swayed against Rio, her body feeling too heavy, too warm, too completely and utterly out of her control.</p><p>Rio held her up, steady and solid, fingers curled tight around Agatha’s waist.</p><p>And God, that should have been embarrassing, the fact that she was practically melting into Rio, barely able to keep herself upright, but her brain was too fogged, and still too lost in the fact that she had just kissed her.</p><p>
<em>She had just kissed her.</em>
</p><p>And now—</p><p>Now, all she wanted was to do it again.</p><p>Her fingers twitched, curling slightly into the soft, worn fabric of Rio’s jacket, and she didn’t even hesitate before tilting her head back up, searching for her mouth again, desperate, reckless, completely gone for it now—</p><p>But Rio stopped her.</p><p>A gentle, firm hand on her shoulder, keeping her from closing the distance.</p><p>Agatha blinked, disoriented, her drunken mind taking a second too long to process the shift in energy.</p><p>Because Rio was still close, still holding her steady, still looking at her with something dark and unreadable in her eyes—</p><p>But she wasn’t leaning in this time.</p><p>She wasn’t going to let this happen again.</p><p>Agatha made a soft, confused sound, barely conscious of how helpless it must have sounded, her body still tilted forward, still wanting, still completely unwilling to pull away.</p><p>But Rio just let out a quiet breath, her fingers squeezing gently where they were bracing her, her voice low, careful, maybe even a little reluctant as she said—</p><p>“You need water, Aggie.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed, her brain fighting through the haze, not fully comprehending what was happening.</p><p>“No, I—” she started, shaking her head, still trying to close the distance, still chasing the heat of Rio’s mouth, still wanting more—</p><p>But Rio clicked her tongue, a soft, amused huff, like she knew exactly how wrecked Agatha was, like she was fully aware that if she let this go on, if she gave her what she wanted—</p><p>Agatha would be in so much fucking trouble come morning.</p><p>So instead, Rio did something Agatha wasn’t expecting.</p><p>She tilted Agatha’s chin up, just enough to make her meet her eyes, her grip gentle, steady, completely in control as she smirked—</p><p>
<em>Not teasing. Not mocking.</em>
</p><p>Just understanding.</p><p>“<em>I know, baby,</em>” Rio murmured, low and soft. “<em>But not like this.</em>”</p><p>And fuck.</p><p>Agatha shivered.</p><p>Because that—that wrecked her in an entirely different way.</p><p>Because she wanted this. She wanted Rio to kiss her again, wanted her hands to stay where they were, wanted to let this spiral out into something she wouldn’t be able to take back—</p><p>But Rio wasn’t letting her.</p><p>Instead, she slid one arm firmly around Agatha’s waist, keeping her upright as she maneuvered them toward the bar, like she had done this before, like this wasn’t her first time dealing with a drunk, spiralling idiot.</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise of protest, still chasing the warmth she had lost, still completely unwilling to accept that Rio wasn’t giving in.</p><p>But Rio just chuckled, shaking her head, her voice low, amused, fond.</p><p>“Come on, lightweight.”</p><p>Agatha pouted. Actually pouted.</p><p>She didn’t even know she was capable of pouting.</p><p>But Rio ruined her.</p><p>Completely.</p><p>“’M not that drunk,” she mumbled, her words slightly slurred, as she leaned against Rio without even thinking about it, her body going pliant, sinking into her warmth like she belonged there.</p><p>Rio snorted. “You can barely stand.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, not disagreeing, her brain too slow, too heavy, too caught up in the way Rio’s hands were still holding her steady.</p><p>Then, suddenly, a cold glass was being pressed into her palm.</p><p>Agatha blinked at it, confused, before realising—</p><p>Water.</p><p>Rio had gotten her water.</p><p>Not another drink. Not another distraction.</p><p>Just water.</p><p>Agatha frowned at it like it had personally offended her.</p><p>Rio laughed, watching her, clearly enjoying herself far too much.</p><p>“<em>Drink,</em>” she said, grinning, like she knew she had won.</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>She couldn’t just drink the water.</p><p>Because if she did, that meant she was listening to Rio. That meant she was accepting defeat, that this—whatever <em>this</em> was—was over for tonight.</p><p>But Rio just tilted her head, watching her struggle, her voice dropping to something lower, as she said—</p><p>“<em>You’ll thank me in the morning.</em>”</p><p>And God.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know if she wanted to kiss her again or strangle her.</p><p>But instead, she just exhaled sharply—and took a sip.</p><p>Agatha drank the water.</p><p>Grudgingly.</p><p>Slowly.</p><p>Like she was being <em>forced</em> to consume something poisonous rather than something that would actually save her from complete devastation in the morning.</p><p>Rio, still annoyingly amused, just watched her sip, arms crossed, her weight resting effortlessly against the bar.</p><p>She looked <em>too</em> good like this. Relaxed, confident, in control. Unbothered. Was she even drunk?</p><p>And Agatha?</p><p>Agatha was none of those things.</p><p>She was wobbly, warm, entirely too aware of the way Rio had just stopped her from making a catastrophic mistake—</p><p>And God, that should have <em>humiliated</em> her.</p><p>It <em>should</em> have.</p><p>But instead, all she could think about was how nice Rio’s hands had felt on her, how firm they had been when they steadied her, how easy it had been to fall into her without hesitation.</p><p>Her straight brain was losing its fucking mind.</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, shaking her head with a half-smirk as she glanced at her phone. “Alright, Aggie,” she murmured, “time to call it a night.”</p><p>Agatha pouted again.</p><p>She needed to stop doing that.</p><p>Rio caught it immediately, her grin widening like she was <em>delighted</em> by Agatha’s completely unhinged behaviour. “Oh, don’t look at me like that.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha argued, which was objectively false, considering she was leaning against the bar like it was the only thing keeping her upright.</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow, her expression dripping with skepticism. “Sure you are.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, indignant, but Rio was already dialling a number, pressing her phone to her ear.</p><p>“Calling a cab,” Rio said, her voice casual, as if this wasn’t the most humiliating moment of Agatha’s life.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, taking another sip of her water just to prove a point—even though she wasn’t sure what the point was anymore.</p><p>After a brief, quiet exchange, Rio ended the call, sliding her phone back into her pocket. “Five minutes,” she said, glancing back at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha scowled. “I could have done that myself.”</p><p>Rio just grinned, unfazed. “Yeah, but you didn’t.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, ready to argue, but before she could, Rio gently wrapped one hand around her wrist, tugging her away from the bar.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio said, her voice calmer now, softer, like she wasn’t just taking care of her but also herding her out of trouble.</p><p>Agatha let herself be guided, her body willing, eager, traitorous, following so easily, so naturally—like this wasn’t a total disaster waiting to happen.</p><p>They found Alice near the entrance, mid-flirtation with a dark-haired woman, her body angled close, her smile lazy and pleased.</p><p>Rio let go of Agatha’s wrist and tapped Alice’s shoulder, interrupting whatever was happening.</p><p>Alice turned, blinking at them, her gaze immediately locking onto Agatha, then shifting to Rio, then back to Agatha again.</p><p>Her smirk grew instantly.</p><p>“Oh, <em>this</em> should be good,” Alice mused, setting her drink down on a nearby table.</p><p>Agatha groaned, already too aware that Alice had seen everything—the dancing, the kiss, the way Agatha was currently leaning slightly into Rio’s side like she had no other option.</p><p>“I’m taking her home,” Rio said simply, ignoring Alice’s blatant curiosity.</p><p>Alice snorted. “Oh, <em>I bet you are</em>.”</p><p>Agatha, still drunk, still warm, still completely unable to handle the knowing look on Alice’s face, scowled. “Not like <em>that</em>.”</p><p>Alice gasped dramatically. “Who said I meant like <em>that</em>?”</p><p>Agatha wanted to sink into the floor and die immediately.</p><p>Rio just laughed, shaking her head. “She’s barely standing,” she pointed out, “so I think it’s time to call it.”</p><p>Alice sighed, dramatically placing a hand over her heart. “Fine, fine. I <em>guess</em> I’ll allow it.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, barely managing to lift her hand in a half-hearted goodbye wave before Rio was tugging her toward the exit again.</p><p>The night air hit her instantly, cooling her flushed skin, sending a small shiver through her body as she stumbled slightly on the pavement.</p><p>Rio’s hand was back on her waist immediately, steadying, warm, right there like she had never left.</p><p>Agatha let out a small, embarrassed breath, pressing her fingers to her temples, willing herself to get a fucking grip.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything, just guided her toward the curb, waiting with effortless patience, like she wasn’t just holding up a drunken disaster of a woman who had just kissed her and then tried to do it again.</p><p>And God, Agatha should say something.</p><p>Something normal. Something casual. Something that would make this feel less like she had just set herself on fire for no reason.</p><p>But instead—</p><p>Instead, she looked at Rio.</p><p>And that?</p><p>That was her first mistake.</p><p>Because Rio was already looking at her.</p><p>Just watching.</p><p>And fuck—</p><p>That was worse.</p><p>The night air helped.</p><p>Not much. But enough.</p><p>Enough to clear the edges of the haze in her brain, to make the world a little sharper, a little more real.</p><p>She could still feel the alcohol weighing her down, thick in her limbs, warm in her chest—but it was fading, bit by bit.</p><p>Which meant clarity.</p><p>Which meant realisation.</p><p>Which meant she was starting to process the fact that she had kissed Rio.</p><p>
<em>She had actually kissed Rio.</em>
</p><p>And she had tried to do it again.</p><p>Agatha groaned quietly, pressing her fingers harder into her temples, willing her brain to shut up, shut up, shut up.</p><p>She wasn’t ready to deal with this.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Not when she was still standing too close to Rio, still feeling the weight of her gaze, still aware of every single inch of space between them—or rather, the lack of it.</p><p>The cab was taking too long.</p><p>Or maybe it wasn’t.</p><p>Maybe time was moving normal, and Agatha was just too hyperaware of everything.</p><p>Her heartbeat, her breathing, the fact that Rio was standing beside her like this was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Rio hadn’t said anything.</p><p>Not about the kiss.</p><p>Not about the way Agatha had practically melted into her arms, let herself be held up, let herself be handled like it was easy, like it was expected.</p><p>No teasing. No smug comments.</p><p>Just—watching.</p><p>Like she was waiting for something.</p><p>The thought made Agatha’s stomach clench.</p><p>Because what was she waiting for?</p><p>For Agatha to bring it up?</p><p>For Agatha to admit she was spiralling?</p><p>For Agatha to—</p><p>The cab pulled up, headlights flashing against the pavement, cutting through the silence between them.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, barely registering the way Rio reached for the door first, holding it open for her.</p><p>She hesitated—just for a second—before climbing in, sliding toward the window, needing space, air, something to separate herself from the unbearable heat of her own skin.</p><p>Rio followed, settling in beside her too close, too much.</p><p>The door shut. The cab pulled away.</p><p>And God, it was quiet.</p><p>Not completely.</p><p>The radio played low, the hum of the city passed by in streaks of light, but inside the cab, it was silence.</p><p>And it was suffocating.</p><p>Agatha shifted, adjusting her posture, trying to act normal.</p><p>She wasn’t <em>that</em> drunk anymore.</p><p>At least, not enough to be reckless again.</p><p>Not enough to try to kiss her again.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>She could still feel it.</p><p>The memory of it, the heat of it, the way Rio’s fingers had tightened when she kissed back, like she actually wanted it, like she actually meant it—</p><p>Agatha’s stomach flipped aggressively.</p><p>She needed to say something.</p><p>Something casual.</p><p>Something that didn’t feel like she was drowning in the weight of what had just happened.</p><p>She licked her lips, exhaled, and—</p><p>“So,” Rio said suddenly, her voice smooth, unreadable, making Agatha jump slightly.</p><p>Agatha turned, her breath sticking in her throat when she realised Rio was already looking at her.</p><p>Expression calm. Controlled. Too controlled.</p><p>Like she wasn’t affected at all.</p><p>Like Agatha hadn’t just kissed her like she needed it, like it had been inevitable, like she hadn’t been spiralling toward this for weeks without realising it.</p><p>She wet her lips. “So?”</p><p>Rio hummed, tilting her head slightly, gaze knowing. “You sobering up?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, turning her gaze toward the window. “Trying to.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, low, quiet. “Good.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, looking back at her. “Why?”</p><p>Rio smirked, but it wasn’t teasing.</p><p>It was something else.</p><p>Something quieter, heavier, more deliberate.</p><p>“Because I want you to remember this,” she said simply.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the fabric of her jeans, the warmth in her stomach spreading, turning into something else entirely.</p><p>And suddenly, she wasn’t sure if she wanted to sober up at all.</p><p>The cab ride felt too long and too short all at once.</p><p>By the time they pulled up to their apartment building, Agatha was steadier but still off-kilter, her body still too warm, too charged, too aware of every second that passed in silence between them.</p><p>Rio paid the driver without hesitation, sliding out of the cab first, then turning back to offer Agatha a hand.</p><p>Agatha stared at it for half a second too long before taking it, her fingers curling around Rio’s, letting her help her out of the car, onto the pavement, into the crisp night air that should have cleared her head but didn’t.</p><p>Because she was still dizzy.</p><p>Still unsteady on her feet, still not entirely sure if it was just the alcohol anymore.</p><p>Rio didn’t let go immediately.</p><p>Her fingers lingered, just for a beat, just long enough that Agatha felt it, before finally releasing her, stuffing her hands into her pockets like she hadn’t just wrecked her without even trying.</p><p>The air felt different between them as they stepped into the building, the lobby dimly lit, quiet, the kind of silence that made everything feel more intimate than it should.</p><p>The kind of silence that felt dangerous.</p><p>They didn’t speak as they approached the elevator, the doors sliding open smoothly, the empty space inside inviting, isolating, inescapable.</p><p>Agatha stepped in first, aware of the way Rio followed, aware of the way they were suddenly alone again, aware of the way the doors slid shut behind them, trapping them in together.</p><p>She let out a slow breath, leaning back against the elevator wall, closing her eyes for a second, willing herself to pull it together, to stop thinking about how Rio was right there, close enough to touch, close enough to—</p><p>She wobbled forward from the motion of the elevator.</p><p>Just a little.</p><p>Just enough that her balance shifted, her legs feeling too weak, too unreliable, and she instinctively reached out for something to ground her.</p><p>She didn’t even think about it.</p><p>Her fingers curled into Rio’s jacket, catching the fabric, steadying herself with the first thing she could reach.</p><p>The problem?</p><p>Rio reached for her at the exact same time.</p><p>Her hands found Agatha’s waist—firm, familiar, easy, like she had been expecting this, like it was natural to catch her, to hold her up.</p><p>And fuck—</p><p>The heat of it.</p><p>The familiarity of it.</p><p>The way Rio didn’t let go immediately, the way her fingers pressed into her sides, warm, grounding, lingering just long enough to make something coil tight in Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>Agatha breathed in, her pulse stuttering, her fingers still clutching at Rio’s jacket, her body still leaning into her like she couldn’t help it, like she didn’t want to stop.</p><p>She opened her eyes.</p><p>Rio was already looking at her.</p><p>Not teasing.</p><p>Not smug.</p><p>Just watching her, waiting, unreadable in a way that made Agatha’s chest feel tight.</p><p>Agatha’s breath shook as she exhaled.</p><p>She licked her lips, her brain screaming at her to stop, to be smart, to not do something she was going to regret—</p><p>But Rio was right there.</p><p>And she wasn’t moving away.</p><p>And she wasn’t stopping her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know if she had the strength to resist.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around Rio’s jacket, her breath hitching, her mind short-circuiting as she tilted forward, her lips parting, her body responding before she could second-guess it—</p><p>The elevator dinged.</p><p>The doors slid open.</p><p>And Agatha froze, her lips a breath away from Rio’s.</p><p>Rio exhaled a slow breath, her grip loosening, the warmth of her hands fading too fast as she stepped back first, her voice steady, collected as she said—</p><p>“Looks like we’re home.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her fingers finally releasing their grip, her pulse pounding in her ears, her mind reeling, reeling, reeling.</p><p>She couldn’t look at her.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Not when she was still catching up to what almost just happened. Again.</p><p>She stepped out of the elevator first.</p><p>Not fast. Not hurried.</p><p>Just… careful.</p><p>Because she wasn’t sure what would happen if she didn’t watch her footing.</p><p>Rio followed.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>Composed.</p><p>And God—</p><p>Agatha didn’t know if she wanted to kiss her or kill her with the way she was acting like none of this was affecting her.</p><p>Maybe both.</p><p>Definitely both.</p><p>The walk down the hallway was silent.</p><p>Not awkward, though. Not tense in the way that meant something had gone <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>Just… <em>thick</em>.</p><p>Thick with everything they weren’t saying, thick with everything that had nearly happened in that elevator, thick with Agatha’s pulse still hammering at the base of her throat, still feeling Rio’s hands on her waist, still dizzy from the weight of her own reckless decisions that night.</p><p>She needed to breathe.</p><p>To get inside her apartment, shut the door, and sleep this off.</p><p>To stop looking at Rio.</p><p>But she couldn’t stop.</p><p>Even as they both reached their respective doors—right across from each other, too close, always too close—even as she fumbled for her keys, her fingers still clumsy, uncoordinated, even as she willed herself to just go inside—</p><p>She still looked at her.</p><p>And Rio was still looking back.</p><p>She leaned against her own doorframe, one hand still tucked into her jacket pocket, the other spinning her keyring idly between her fingers, her expression unreadable, considering, quiet in a way that made Agatha’s stomach twist painfully.</p><p>Neither of them spoke.</p><p>For a moment, the only sound was the soft hum of the hallway lights, the faint creak of the building settling.</p><p>Then—</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, her voice low, careful, like she was offering something dangerous.</p><p>“You wanna come in?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her mouth opening slightly.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around her keys.</p><p>And fuck—</p><p>She <em>shouldn’t</em>.</p><p>She really, really shouldn’t.</p><p>Because she was still a little drunk, still reeling, still one reckless choice away from doing something she wasn’t sure she could take back.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>Rio looked too relaxed, too knowing, too in control while Agatha was still spiralling.</p><p>She swallowed, aware of the weight of the invitation, of the way it felt less like a casual offer and more like a challenge.</p><p>She wet her lips, hesitating. “I—”</p><p>But Rio’s gaze didn’t waver.</p><p>Didn’t push. Didn’t pressure.</p><p>But didn’t withdraw, either.</p><p>Just waited.</p><p>Waited for Agatha to decide.</p><p>For Agatha to either step forward or step away.</p><p>The air between them stretched unbearably thin, the echo of the near-kiss in the elevator still clinging to her skin, still hot.</p><p>She could still feel the memory of it, still feel the way her body had tilted forward, had been ready to fall into it completely—</p><p>And she knew.</p><p>She knew if she stepped inside, if she crossed the threshold, if she let herself walk into Rio’s apartment tonight—</p><p>She wouldn’t leave.</p><p>Not before she did something reckless.</p><p>Not before she did something that would change everything.</p><p>She was sober enough to know that now.</p><p>And that was the problem.</p><p>Because she wasn’t drunk enough to use it as an excuse anymore.</p><p>She was making this decision fully aware of what it meant.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly.</p><p>Her fingers loosened around her keys.</p><p>She should say no.</p><p>She <em>knows</em> she should.</p><p>The smart thing—the <em>safe</em> thing—would be to shake her head, mumble a quick, flimsy excuse, and disappear into her apartment before she does something irreversible.</p><p>But she doesn’t move.</p><p>She doesn’t unlock her door.</p><p>She doesn’t step back.</p><p>Because Rio is still looking at her like that.</p><p>Like she already knows what Agatha’s going to do.</p><p>Like she’s already won.</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounds, her pulse a relentless drumbeat against her ribs as she watches Rio stand there so casually, still leaning against her doorframe, still waiting, still so <em>infuriatingly</em> patient.</p><p>The silence stretches.</p><p>The invitation lingers.</p><p>And Agatha—still a <em>little</em> drunk, <em>reckless</em>, teetering on the edge of a decision she’ll never be able to take back— pulls her keys from the lock.</p>

<p>The hallway outside Rio’s apartment was quiet except for the soft scrape of the key sliding from the lock. Agatha swayed slightly, the alcohol still humming through her veins—not enough to make her incoherent, but enough to keep her from completely second-guessing what she was about to do.</p><p>She told herself it was just curiosity. Nothing more.</p><p>Rio pushed her door open, stepping inside first, her silhouette dark against the warm glow of her apartment. She turned slightly, glancing back over her shoulder. The invitation was silent, but it was there.</p><p>A choice.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for half a second before she stepped forward, crossing the threshold with measured, deliberate steps. The door clicked shut behind her, sealing her inside.</p><p>Rio’s apartment was familiar—she had been here before, after all, usually by force rather than choice—but tonight, it felt different. The air was thicker, the shadows deeper. The faint scent of whatever perfume Rio had worn earlier still lingered, mingling with something warm, something unmistakably <em>her</em>.</p><p>Agatha folded her arms, suddenly hyperaware of how quiet it was.</p><p>“Well,” she drawled, filling the silence, “I’d say you’re a terrible host, but I suppose offering me a drink would be redundant at this point.”</p><p>Rio smirked, kicking off her boots and hanging her jacket on a hook, her movements fluid, unbothered. “That’s not why I invited you in, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach clenched, her fingers twitching where they rested against her arms.</p><p>She knew that.</p><p>Of course she knew that.</p><p>And yet, she still felt the need to say something, to keep up <em>some</em> kind of barrier between herself and whatever was about to happen next.</p><p>“Mm,” she hummed, glancing around the apartment like she wasn’t acutely aware of Rio standing just a few feet away. “So what does your hospitality include, then?”</p><p>Rio stepped forward, slow and deliberate, closing the space between them with an ease that made Agatha’s pulse stutter. “You’re not here for small talk.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, but she didn’t move away.</p><p>Rio was standing close enough now that Agatha could see the subtle shift in her expression in the dark—the slight tilt of her head, the way her eyes flickered down, just for a second, before settling back on Agatha’s face.</p><p>A silent question. A warning.</p><p>
<em>Are you sure?</em>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed. She had made the decision to step inside, hadn’t she? She wasn’t drunk enough to blame it on bad judgment. She wasn’t unaware of what this meant.</p><p>She was here.</p><p>And she was going to see it through.</p><p>She lifted her chin slightly, steadying herself against the weight of Rio’s gaze. “Then what am I here for?”</p><p>Rio’s smirk didn’t fade, but something about it changed—sharpened, darkened. Her fingers reached up, skimming lightly along the inside of Agatha’s wrist, her touch feather-light but intentional.</p><p>“To stop pretending,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha barely had a second to process the words before Rio was kissing her.</p><p>Agatha felt it immediately—how different this kiss was to their last, how much clearer everything was. Her head was still swimming with the remnants of alcohol, but it wasn’t enough to blur the edges, wasn’t enough to excuse this as just another mistake. She was aware, <em>painfully</em> aware of every single thing happening between them.</p><p>The heat of Rio’s breath against her lips. The slow, teasing way her mouth brushed against Agatha’s, barely there at first, as if she was waiting—waiting for Agatha to either lean in or pull away.</p><p>She didn’t pull away.</p><p>She <em>couldn’t</em>.</p><p>Rio kissed her with intent. Her lips were warm, softer than Agatha expected, but <em>assured</em>, moving with a confidence that sent something hot and restless curling low in her stomach. She wasn’t taking, wasn’t even demanding—not yet—but she was <em>guiding</em>, leading Agatha into something she wasn’t prepared for, something she had never done before but suddenly, <em>desperate</em>ly, wanted to.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath through her nose as Rio tilted her head slightly, deepening the kiss just enough to make her dizzy. She could taste the faint remnants of tequila and citrus on Rio’s tongue when it swept along her lower lip, coaxing—<em>coaxing</em>, not forcing—her mouth open.</p><p>And then, <em>fuck</em>, there it was.</p><p>That <em>feeling</em>.</p><p>It was nothing like kissing a man.</p><p>There was no rough, clumsy pressure, no stiff, one-sided push and pull. This was <em>fluid</em>, this was <em>calculated</em>, a perfect balance between control and indulgence. Rio’s lips molded against hers in a slow, melting rhythm, her tongue licking into Agatha’s mouth with an ease that made her shudder. The slide of it was warm, slick, deliberate—hot—as if Rio was mapping her out, learning the way she tasted, <em>memorising</em> her.</p><p>Agatha made a sound in the back of her throat, something between a gasp and a groan, her fingers tightening in the fabric of Rio’s shirt, trying to ground herself against the sheer shockwave of it all.</p><p>How had she never felt this before?</p><p>How had she gone her entire life thinking she knew what kissing was, only to have it completely rewritten in the space of a few breaths?</p><p>Her skin was burning, prickling with awareness as Rio’s hands slid up her sides—slow, <em>so</em> slow—barely touching, just skimming fingertips over the fabric of her shirt. <em>Taunting.</em> Agatha’s chest ached with the need to be closer, to feel more, and she barely even registered how desperately she was pressing against Rio until she felt the soft, pleased hum that vibrated against her lips.</p><p>The sound alone sent a shock of warmth spiralling through her, pooling deep in her stomach.</p><p>She wanted—<em>god</em>, she wanted—</p><p>But she didn’t even know what.</p><p>She wasn’t in control anymore.</p><p>She was used to being the one leading, the one <em>pushing</em>, the one making the first move, but this was something else entirely. Rio wasn’t just kissing her. She was <em>teaching</em> her.</p><p>Teaching her how to <em>lose</em>.</p><p>Teaching her how to let someone else take the reins, how to be unravelled, how to feel every second of this without thinking, without overanalysing, without fighting for control that had already slipped through her fingers the second she stepped inside this apartment.</p><p>Rio pulled away just enough to let Agatha breathe, but not nearly enough to give her space. Their foreheads were nearly touching, the heat between them thick and tangible, and Agatha could still feel the kiss everywhere—on her lips, her tongue, her skin, like it had left an imprint.</p><p>Her breath was coming fast, and <em>god</em>, she knew she should say something—<em>anything</em>—but the only thought looping in her head was <em>more</em>.</p><p>Rio’s lips curled into a smirk, her fingers flexing slightly where they rested against Agatha’s waist. “You okay there, Aggie?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, hating the way her name sounded so good in Rio’s mouth, hating the way her voice was still so smooth and steady while Agatha felt like she was about to come undone just from a kiss.</p><p>
<em>Get it together, Harkness.</em>
</p><p>Instead of answering, she reached for Rio, fingers twisting in her shirt, pulling her back in, crashing their mouths together with enough force to make Rio laugh against her lips.</p><p>But the laughter barely lasted a second before it shifted—before Rio sighed into her mouth, sinking into the kiss with a hunger that sent a full-body shiver through Agatha.</p><p>And then, suddenly, they weren’t just kissing anymore.</p><p>They were <em>grappling.</em></p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure who moved first, but it didn’t matter—she felt the hard press of Rio’s body against her own, felt the delicious give of her as she pushed her backward, felt the sharp sting of teeth when Rio caught her bottom lip between them and bit.</p><p>The noise that tore from Agatha’s throat was embarrassingly close to a whimper, and she barely had time to process it before Rio swallowed the sound down, deepening the kiss, licking into her mouth with a slow, intoxicating drag that made Agatha’s knees go weak.</p><p>She clutched at Rio’s shoulders, desperate for leverage, desperate to stay upright, but it didn’t help—it didn’t stop the heat from clawing through her, from making her <em>need</em> in a way she had never felt before.</p><p>It was like something inside her had snapped—like all the irritation, the tension, the <em>denial</em> had finally boiled over into something feral.</p><p>She didn’t even realise she was backing Rio up until they slammed into the wall with a muffled thud.</p><p>Rio grunted, but she was grinning like she had won, and the sight of it made Agatha want to <em>wipe it off her face</em>.</p><p>So she did.</p><p>With her mouth.</p><p>She kissed her hard, pressing her against the wall, sucking at Rio’s bottom lip just to hear that pleased little hum she had made earlier, just to feel her melt for half a second before she took control back like it had never left her hands.</p><p>And <em>fuck</em>, she did.</p><p>Because before Agatha could revel in it, Rio moved, flipping their positions effortlessly, pinning <em>her</em> against the wall instead.</p><p>The impact knocked the breath from Agatha’s lungs, and Rio must have sensed it, because she paused—for a fraction of a second, just enough to tease, just enough to make Agatha’s stomach twist—before she crushed their mouths back together.</p><p>Agatha groaned into it, her head tilting back against the wall, her fingers scrabbling at the hem of Rio’s shirt, pushing it up, needing to feel skin, needing to do something before she lost herself completely.</p><p>Rio pulled back just long enough to yank her shirt over her head, tossing it carelessly to the floor.</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered.</p><p>It wasn’t that she hadn’t known—she had seen Rio before, knew she was fit, knew she had no right being as effortlessly attractive as she was—but <em>seeing</em> her like this, with her skin flushed from kissing, her chest rising and falling hard, her pupils blown wide and dark—</p><p>It was unfair.</p><p>Rio smirked lie she knew what was going on in Agatha’s mind, hands settling on Agatha’s waist, thumbs sliding just under the hem of her shirt, patiently waiting.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, trying to collect some of her dignity despite the fact that her pulse was thundering so loudly she could hear it.</p><p>“I see your hospitality still needs some work,” she muttered, her voice raspier than she wanted it to be.</p><p>Rio hummed, leaning in, her lips barely grazing Agatha’s jaw. “You want a drink, sweetheart?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath. “I want you to stop stalling.”</p><p>Rio chuckled against her skin, her hands finally sliding higher, up under Agatha’s shirt, skimming over her ribs, setting her skin on fire with every slow, infuriating touch.</p><p>And then, without warning—</p><p>She lifted.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to yelp before she was suddenly off the ground, her legs instinctively wrapping around Rio’s waist, her back pressing hard against the wall as she clung to her, breathless and aching.</p><p>She felt Rio’s strength, felt the solidness of her, and something inside her <em>s</em>hattered at the realisation that she actually wasn’t the one in control here.</p><p>Rio smirked, her lips brushing just under Agatha’s ear as she murmured, “Still think I’m stalling?”</p><p>And then she bit her neck.</p><p>Sharp enough to make Agatha jerk—sharp enough to make her head fall back against the wall, her nails dig into Rio’s shoulders, her lips part on a breathless, desperate, <em>fuck</em>.</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>And then they were moving—stumbling, knocking into furniture as Rio carried her across the room, kissing her through every step, every shift, every second.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to register it before she felt the sudden give of a couch behind her, before she was being dropped onto it, before Rio was crawling on top of her, sinking between her legs, kissing her senseless.</p><p>Agatha gasped into it, arching up into the heat of her, tangling her fingers in Rio’s hair, pulling, tugging, feeling the way Rio sighed into her mouth at the roughness.</p><p>And god, the way she kissed—</p><p>It was filthy, devouring, tongue sliding deep into Agatha’s mouth, sucking, teasing, like she was trying to wreck her before they even got to the good part.</p><p>Agatha barely registered the sound of her own breath—shallow, sharp, completely unsteady—as Rio’s hands slid higher, fingers curling under the hem of her shirt. She was barely aware of her own body, barely aware of anything but the molten, desperate pull in her stomach, the way heat was coiling tight and fast beneath her skin.</p><p>She wasn’t thinking anymore.</p><p>She wasn’t <em>fighting </em>it anymore.</p><p>She lifted her arms automatically as Rio pulled the fabric up and over her head, tossing it somewhere behind them without a care.</p><p>The moment she was almost bare beneath her, Rio stopped.</p><p>Agatha should have expected it by now—the way Rio played with her, the way she never rushed, the way she savoured the moment like she had all the time in the world. She was looking at her now, her dark eyes sweeping slow, dragging over her skin with an intensity that made Agatha’s chest tighten, made her feel watched, like Rio was memorising every detail.</p><p>It made her ache.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers flexed against Rio’s shoulders, her nails pressing in—not quite digging, not quite pulling—just holding on as she waited, every nerve in her body lighting up in anticipation.</p><p>Rio exhaled, low and slow, the ghost of a smirk pulling at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“Jesus,” she muttered, her voice rougher than before, thick with something indistinguishable. “You really are something else, huh?”</p><p>Agatha huffed, trying for exasperation, but it came out breathless.</p><p>“I swear to God,” she managed, “if you keep—”</p><p>She didn’t get to finish.</p><p>Rio dipped her head, her mouth dragging hot and open over Agatha’s collarbone, down, her tongue flicking out to taste her skin, leaving a damp, burning trail that made Agatha shudder. She sucked a mark into the space just above her breast, her teeth scraping lightly as she pulled away, and Agatha’s back arched, gasping, heat pulsing between her legs, sharp and demanding.</p><p>“You were saying?” Rio murmured against her skin, her breath hot against her skin.</p><p>Agatha snapped.</p><p>Her fingers tangled in Rio’s hair, tugging hard as she dragged her back up, crashing their mouths together in a way that was all teeth and heat, all frustration and hunger, all give me more, now, now, now.</p><p>Rio groaned into it, her hands tightening on Agatha’s waist, pressing her down, holding her in place as she took control of the kiss again, deepening it, devouring her like she had been waiting for Agatha to do that.</p><p>The friction between them was unbearable.</p><p>Agatha could feel the heat radiating off Rio, feel the hard press of her against her body, feel the delicious, aching drag of fabric against fabric, the <em>obnoxious</em> barrier of clothes still in the way.</p><p>She needed them off.</p><p>Now.</p><p>Her hands moved, fumbling between them, pushing, grabbing, desperately trying to unfasten Rio’s belt.</p><p>Rio chuckled against her lips, the sound low, breathy, but full of amusement.</p><p>“Eager, are we?”</p><p>Agatha growled, her fingers tightening around the buckle, yanking at it, more forceful than necessary. “If you say one more word, I’m leaving.”</p><p>Rio grinned, letting her, lifting her hips just enough to help, her own hands working quickly, slipping the rest of her jeans down before moving to Agatha’s, shoving them down and off, fingers brushing hot against her thighs.</p><p>Everything was moving too fast and too slow at the same time.</p><p>The moment Rio’s fingers skimmed higher, dragging up over the inside of Agatha’s thigh, over her still covered core, her stomach tightened, her breath catching in her throat.</p><p>And then Rio stilled.</p><p>Just for a second.</p><p>Just long enough for Agatha to realise how wet she was.</p><p>The realisation sent a jolt through her—half shame, half <em>fuck, I want her to touch me, I want her to touch me now</em>—and the way Rio sighed, soft and pleased, made Agatha’s head fall back against the couch with a shuddering exhale.</p><p>Rio’s lips brushed just under her jaw as her fingers traced slow, torturous circles over the fabric of her underwear.</p><p>“You’re<em> soaked</em>,” Rio murmured, almost mocking, almost praising, her breath hot against Agatha’s ear.</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, hating the way she twitched at the words, hating the way her thighs tensed like she was about to buck up into Rio’s hand, <em>chase</em> it, <em>beg</em> for more.</p><p>She wasn’t going to give her the satisfaction.</p><p>Agatha forced her voice to stay steady, though it was already fracturing. “Then maybe you should stop talking about it and do something.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched.</p><p>And then—</p><p>Finally. <em>Finally.</em></p><p>She did.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to brace herself before she felt it—before Rio’s fingers slid beneath the fabric, pressing firmly against her, coating themselves in her slick heat, feeling everything, and god, Agatha was already ruined.</p><p>She felt Rio’s breath hitch against her throat, felt her exhale sharply, her fingers just pressing there, just exploring, just learning.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio murmured, almost to herself. “You’re drenched, Cariño.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered.</p><p>She hated it.</p><p>
<em>She loved it.</em>
</p><p>She felt exposed, laid bare, but at the same time, she was burning, her thighs tensing, her breath coming in sharp, short, hitched little gasps as Rio’s fingers began to move.</p><p>It wasn’t enough.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Because Rio wasn’t just taking—she was taunting, barely moving, just stroking, tracing, testing, spreading her open with the lightest drag of her fingers, coaxing more out of her, making Agatha squirm, making her <em>ache.</em></p><p>“Jesus <em>fucking</em> Christ,” Agatha gritted out, her fingers clutching at Rio’s shoulders, nails biting into skin, trying to ground herself, trying to control her breathing, trying to not completely fucking lose it.</p><p>Rio smirked against her neck, but her breath was ragged, her own control slipping. “Look at you,” she murmured, her voice silk and smoke, mocking and reverent all at once.</p><p>Agatha hated the way she sounded—smug, self-satisfied, like she was winning.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t about to let her win.</p><p>But fuck, she was so close to just falling apart right there.</p><p>Rio’s fingers teased, barely applying pressure, just stroking, spreading her slickness around, dragging her fingers through it, feeling her, memorising her, before finally her fingers slid in.</p><p>Agatha gasped, her head snapping back, her spine arching as heat shot through her entire body, her hips jerking up into the sensation.</p><p>She was slow at first, gentle, filling her, stretching her open, letting Agatha feel every single inch as she pushed in deep, then dragged back out, teasing her with the loss before pressing in again.</p><p>Agatha was panting, her body trembling, her nails digging in deeper, her thighs quivering around Rio’s waist.</p><p>And then—</p><p>Rio’s thumb found her clit.</p><p>Agatha choked on a gasp, her body jerking, clenching down around Rio’s fingers instinctively, heat rushing through her like a fucking tidal wave.</p><p>“Oh—fuck—”</p><p>Rio moaned, low, throaty, like she was just as wrecked as Agatha was, like feeling her react was doing something to her, too.</p><p>And god, that should have made Agatha feel powerful—</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Because she was helpless.</p><p>And Rio wasn’t stopping.</p><p>She was stroking, pressing, circling her thumb in slow, maddening patterns, building her up, pushing her higher, and her fingers—fuck, her fingers—</p><p>They were curling inside her, hitting exactly the right spot, making Agatha cry out, making her squirm, making her clench around her, making her fall apart too fast, too soon—</p><p>But Rio wouldn’t let her go yet.</p><p>“You’re so fucking responsive,” Rio muttered, voice wrecked, low, dangerous, pressing kisses to Agatha’s jaw, her throat, her collarbone, anywhere she could reach, her fingers working her, keeping her right there, right on the edge, just to hold her there—but it wasn’t <em>enough.</em></p><p>Not nearly <em>enough</em>.</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp, frustrated noise against Rio’s mouth, her hips rolling up against her hand, chasing more, <em>demanding</em> more, but Rio pulled back, chuckling, the sound warm and infuriating against her lips.</p><p>“Someone’s greedy,” Rio murmured, her nose brushing against Agatha’s, her fingers stalling inside her, taunting.</p><p>Agatha growled, fingers twisting in Rio’s hair, yanking her back down into a bruising, <em>teeth-clashing</em> kiss. “If you don’t stop playing with me—”</p><p>Rio laughed, slow and deep, before biting her lower lip hard, making Agatha gasp. “What, sweetheart? You’ll do what?”</p><p>Agatha <em>hated</em> her.</p><p>She hated how smug she sounded.</p><p>Of course Agatha wasn’t going to do <em>anything</em>—not when she was so wrecked, not when her body was trembling, not when she was so drunk on the feeling of Rio’s fingers inside her she could barely breathe.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio murmured, voice like smoke and honey, her lips grazing over Agatha’s jaw, her teeth scraping. “That’s what I thought.”</p><p>Agatha <em>was</em> greedy.</p><p>She <em>was</em> desperate.</p><p>And god, she didn’t even care.</p><p>She just wanted.</p><p>
<em>Needed.</em>
</p><p>But then Rio did something that made her freeze, her breath catching hard in her throat.</p><p>She withdrew her fingers.</p><p>Completely.</p><p>Agatha almost whined at the loss, her body trembling, her hips arching up, but before she could complain, before she could even think—</p><p>Rio’s mouth was on her throat, hot, wet, open, and sucking hard enough that Agatha felt the blood rush to the surface immediately.</p><p>Marking her.</p><p>Leaving a very visible reminder.</p><p>Agatha’s nails dug into Rio’s back, her thighs tensing around her waist as heat shot straight through her, as Rio bit down, just enough to make her gasp, her whole body reacting before she could process it.</p><p>Rio hummed, pleased, kissing over the bruise she had left behind.</p><p>“Want you to remember this,” she muttered, dragging her lips lower, down Agatha’s collarbone, over the curve of her breast, her teeth grazing along the lace of her bra.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened in Rio’s hair, her breath coming fast, her chest rising and falling rapidly. “Trust me,” she panted, barely coherent, “I’m not going to forget.”</p><p>Rio grinned against her skin.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>And then she slid her hands under Agatha’s bra, pushing it up, making no effort to remove it properly, just enough to bare her breasts, just enough to expose them to the cool air, making her shiver.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to register the exposure before Rio’s mouth was on her.</p><p>Her tongue flicked over a hardened nipple, slow and deliberate, circling, teasing, and then—fuck—she sucked, hard and wet, drawing her deep into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha choked on a moan, her back arching, the sensation so overwhelming, so new, she almost couldn’t process it.</p><p>The <em>heat</em> of it. The <em>wetness</em>. The way Rio’s tongue swirled, then flattened, then—fuck—the way she bit down, just enough to make Agatha’s stomach clench and her hips jerk up against Rio’s stomach</p><p>“Oh, <em>fuck</em>,” Agatha gasped, her head falling back against the couch.</p><p>Rio grinned, her tongue lapping over the sensitive skin in apology before moving to the other breast, giving it the same attention, sucking, biting, soothing, her hands gripping Agatha’s hips, pinning her down so she couldn’t move.</p><p>Agatha’s breath was shaky, her fingers tangling in Rio’s hair, her body thrumming as Rio’s mouth dragged lower, teeth grazing, lips lingering, tongue leaving wet in its wake.</p><p>She was taking her time, marking her, sucking deep, possessive bruises into Agatha’s breasts and stomach, nipping, biting, lapping over the sensitive skin afterwards as if to soothe the sting.</p><p>Agatha knew she would be covered in reminders of this tomorrow.</p><p>And she realised she liked it.</p><p>“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do this,” Rio breathed, her voice low, rasping, her mouth still hot against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>Her hands were firm, gripping, holding Agatha in place, owning her, her thumbs stroking over her ribs as she dragged her tongue over her nipple, slow, teasing, before sucking her deep into her mouth again.</p><p>Agatha shuddered, another gush of wetness between her thighs, her chest rising sharply against Rio’s lips.</p><p>Still, she managed to bite back at her, her voice taunting, breathless, her nails scraping down Rio’s back—</p><p>“At least since last weekend when I heard you moaning through the walls, you fucking exhibitionist.”</p><p>Rio froze for half a second.</p><p>Then she pulled back, her cheeks flushed, but her expression smug, her tongue flicking over her swollen lips.</p><p>“I was hoping you’d hear that,” she admitted, her voice low, sultry, challenging, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s.</p><p>Something tightened in Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>Heat flooded through her.</p><p>Because fuck—</p><p>The way Rio said it, the way her eyes burned, the way her fingers flexed against her hips like she was about to destroy her all over again—</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>“I hate you,” she muttered, her voice weak, her body betraying her.</p><p>Rio grinned, her teeth flashing, her hands sliding lower, her breath hot against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>“Liar,” she whispered.</p><p>And then she sank her teeth into Agatha’s breast again, and all Agatha could do was whimper.</p><p>Agatha twisted, trying to move, trying to do something, but Rio just laughed, her teeth grazing her ribs as she moved lower. “Where do you think you’re going?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath was shaking, her fingers digging into Rio’s shoulders. “You’re <em>taking your time</em>—”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio agreed, grinning against her stomach. “I <em>am</em>.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, trying to pull her back up, but Rio resisted, biting at the curve of her hip, holding her down.</p><p>“You’re so impatient, <em>baby</em>,” she murmured, and Agatha shivered, the new nickname sending something hot and shameful spiralling through her.</p><p>She wanted to fight it.</p><p>But she <em>couldn’t</em>.</p><p>Rio’s fingers hooked in the waistband of her underwear, tugging them down, slow, agonising, peeling them away inch by inch.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>And when Rio kissed the inside of her thigh, slow and lingering, her teeth scraping, Agatha knew what was about to happen.</p><p>Agatha hated to admit it, but she had never been eaten out before.</p><p>Never had <em>anyone</em> do this to her—never had <em>anyone</em> press their mouth between her legs, never had someone kiss, taste, worship her the way she knew Rio was about to.</p><p>And fuck, she was going to feel it.</p><p>Every. Single. Second.</p><p>Her thighs tensed as Rio’s breath ghosted over her bare skin, her mouth still teasing, still lingering on the inside of her thigh, pressing slow, open-mouthed kisses against sensitive flesh—too close, not close enough.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into the couch, digging in, trying to find something—anything—to hold onto. She could feel heat, thick and suffocating, pressing against her ribs, coiling low, winding tighter with every second Rio delayed.</p><p>Her head was spinning, her body trembling, her breath coming in sharp, uneven gasps, and she wasn’t even sure if it was from the alcohol still in her system or just the overwhelming reality of what was about to happen.</p><p>Probably both.</p><p>But mostly? It was Rio.</p><p>She was always the one in control, always the one who dictated the pace, who decided how far things went, who set the limits.</p><p>But <em>this</em>?</p><p><em>This</em> was free-falling.</p><p>And Rio wasn’t just letting her fall—she was pulling her down, slow and intentional, making sure Agatha felt every single second of it.</p><p>“Jesus <em>fucking</em> Christ,” Agatha hissed again in agitation and impatience, her head thumping back against the couch, her nails digging into the upholstery as Rio bit at the inside of her thigh, sucking a deep, possessive mark into the skin there.</p><p>Rio chuckled, her lips brushing dangerously close to where Agatha was aching for her.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into the couch, <em>“Rio.”</em></p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha growled, trying to arch up, trying to move, but Rio held her down firmly, one strong hand pressing against her stomach, pinning her in place.</p><p>“Say it,” Rio murmured, her tongue flicking out, teasing, making Agatha jerk beneath her, her thighs shaking.</p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved, her throat dry, her fingers twitching, clenching, trying to decide between pushing Rio away and dragging her closer.</p><p>She caved.</p><p>She grabbed at Rio’s hair, yanking her towards where she needed her the most, her voice breaking between breaths—</p><p>“Fucking<em>—do something</em>.”</p><p>Rio laughed, pleased, satisfied, before she let up from pushing back into Agatha's hand and let her push her forward.</p><p>Her tongue pressed against her, hot and wet, dragging through the slick heat of her, tasting her, learning her, and Agatha’s entire body seized.</p><p>A wrecked, shaking, utterly ruined gasp tore from her throat, her hips jerking up, her nails scraping against Rio’s scalp.</p><p>“Oh my god—”</p><p>Rio moaned, deep and low, sending vibrations up Agatha’s spine as she licked into her, slow, deep, <em>taking her time</em>, dragging her tongue in long, deliberate strokes like she wanted to savour every drop.</p><p>It was wet, it was messy, it was so fucking good Agatha thought she might black out from it.</p><p>Her thighs quivered, trying to clamp shut, but Rio just gripped them, spreading them wider, keeping her open, keeping her powerless.</p><p>“Jesus <em>fucking</em> Christ,” Agatha gasped, her voice breaking, her nails biting into Rio’s scalp.</p><p>Rio hummed, pleased, and her tongue flicked, circling, teasing, before she sucked Agatha’s clit into her mouth and—</p><p>“Oh—oh fuck—”</p><p>Agatha choked on her own breath, her hips bucking hard, her whole body shaking as pleasure tore through her, <em>sudden</em>, <em>blinding</em>, <em>overwhelming</em>.</p><p>Rio held her down, devouring her, working her over and over, building her up, making her dizzy, making her fall apart one slow, shattering second at a time.</p><p>It was too much—</p><p>It wasn’t enough—</p><p>And then—</p><p>Fingers.</p><p>Rio’s fingers were at her entrance, pressing, teasing, waiting—</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her fingers clutching at Rio’s hair, holding her there, unsure if she was trying to stop her or urge her on.</p><p>Rio could tell.</p><p>She lifted her head, lips glistening, eyes dark, smirking against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>“Ever had someone fuck you like this before?” she murmured, pressing a single teasing kiss to the inside of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, panting, shaking, too wrecked to lie.</p><p>“No?” Rio mused, tracing circles against her entrance, waiting, taunting. “Then I guess you’ll want me to be gentle.”</p><p>Agatha made a feral, incoherent sound and yanked at Rio’s hair harder.</p><p>“<em>Shut up</em>,” she panted, “and fuck me.”</p><p>Rio grinned and followed the order.</p><p>She slid two fingers inside, smooth and deep, filling her in one slow, deliberate thrust, stretching her open, making Agatha see stars.</p><p>Agatha cried out, her back arching, her breath stuttering, her thighs shaking as Rio curled her fingers, finding that perfect spot, rubbing, pressing, stroking, making Agatha’s entire body tense.</p><p>“Oh, my god—”</p><p>Rio didn’t stop.</p><p>She set a rhythm, slow at first, pulling back, pressing in, letting Agatha feel every single inch, dragging it out, teasing her—</p><p>And then she lowered her mouth again, her tongue finding her clit, her fingers thrusting deeper, and Agatha broke almost embarrassingly fast.</p><p>She came hard after only a few more strokes of Rio's fingers, with a wrecked, shuddering moan, her entire body convulsing, her nails digging into Rio's scalp, her hips jerking, riding out the overwhelming, all-consuming heat of it as Rio fucked her through it, dragging it out, refusing to stop.</p><p>Agatha had never felt anything like it—never been touched like this, taken apart like this, worshiped like this—</p><p>And as Rio eased her down, slowing the thrust of her fingers, pressing soft, gentle kisses against the inside of her thighs, letting her breathe, letting her come back to herself, she realised something.</p><p>She was never going to be the same.</p><p>Rio pressed a final, teasing, possessive kiss to the bruise she had left on Agatha’s hip and murmured—</p><p>“You look so fucking pretty like this.”</p><p>Agatha barely had the strength to murder her for that comment.</p><p>But give her a minute.</p><p>She’d get there.</p><p>She was still panting, her chest rising and falling in sharp, shuddering breaths as the aftershocks of her orgasm pulsed through her body. She should have been spent, wrecked, ruined—and for a moment, she <em>was</em>.</p><p>But then Rio—smug, insufferable, unbearably cocky Rio—kissed the inside of her thigh again, like she was pleased with herself, like she had just won, and Agatha’s brain snapped back online.</p><p>Oh, no. No, no, no.</p><p>She was <em>not</em> about to let Rio Vidal get the upper hand.</p><p>Not <em>completely</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched where they now lay resting uselessly against the couch. She was still sensitive, still buzzing, but she could already feel her mind sharpening again, recalculating and reassessing.</p><p>Rio had wrecked her, yes.</p><p>But Agatha?</p><p>She was about to return the favour.</p><p>Her breath was still uneven as she forced her body to move, sitting up abruptly, her hands gripping Rio’s shoulders before shoving her back.</p><p>Rio squealed in surprise, landing hard on her ass on the couch, her pupils still blown, her lips kiss-swollen, her chin slick from where she had just buried herself between Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Agatha saw the way her breath hitched, saw the way her body tensed, excited by the sudden shift in control.</p><p>But she still had the audacity to smirk.</p><p>“Oh?” Rio murmured, tilting her head, still looking far too cocky for someone who was about to be absolutely ruined. “You back with me, Sweetheart?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, crawling forward, her thighs still shaky, but her determination burning through it.</p><p>She settled herself over Rio’s lap, straddling her, and was rewarded with the subtle, pleased inhale that Rio tried to hide.</p><p>Good.</p><p>She wasn’t the only one unravelling.</p><p>Agatha let her fingers trail down, feeling Rio’s skin heat beneath her touch, fingers skimming over her shoulders, then lower, until they reached the clasp of her bra.</p><p>Her hands fumbled for a second, but she managed to undo it hastily, sliding the straps off Rio’s shoulders, letting the fabric fall away before she tossed it aside.</p><p>And then—</p><p>She froze.</p><p>She was staring.</p><p>Because fuck—she had never really looked before.</p><p>Sure, she had seen breasts—she had her own, after all—but this was different.</p><p>Because this was Rio’s.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers hovered, just barely grazing over soft, full curves, her mouth slightly parted, her breath suddenly caught in her throat.</p><p>She could see Rio’s nipples, already peaked, already waiting, and something hot coiled deep in her stomach at the realization that this was because of her.</p><p>Her hands moved on instinct, cupping them, testing their weight, her thumbs dragging experimentally over hardened peaks, feeling how warm and soft Rio was beneath her fingers.</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, her back arching slightly, her nails digging into Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her touch still uncertain, still exploring, her thumbs rubbing in slow, lazy circles, her palms kneading, pressing just enough to feel the way Rio reacted, the way her breath came a little faster, a little shakier.</p><p>“You’ve never touched a woman before, have you?”</p><p>Rio’s voice was husky, thick with heat, her lips curling in amusement even as her head tipped back against the couch, her body responding despite her teasing.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks burned, but she didn’t stop.</p><p>“I have,” she said, her voice dry, her thumbs brushing experimentally over Rio’s nipples, feeling them tighten even more beneath her touch. She didn’t need to tell her that she meant herself.</p><p>She watched Rio twitch, her lips parting slightly, her breath catching.</p><p>Agatha’s smirk deepened.</p><p>“I just never really appreciated it before.”</p><p>Rio groaned, but whether it was from Agatha’s touch or from how fucking smug she sounded, she didn’t know.</p><p>So she kept going.</p><p>She leaned in, close, her mouth hovering just over Rio’s jaw, her breath fanning over her throat as she continued to explore, kneading, pinching lightly, watching the way Rio’s stomach tensed, the way her lips parted slightly, the way her body arched into it.</p><p>
<em>Interesting.</em>
</p><p>Agatha let her tongue flick out, dragging slowly over the curve of Rio’s jaw, before she sank her teeth into her throat.</p><p>Rio cursed sharply, her head falling back, her hands gripping Agatha’s thighs, nails pressing in as Agatha bit and sucked, dragging her teeth over soft skin, marking her the way Rio had marked her.</p><p>Rio had been so intent on making Agatha remember this physically, leaving bruises, leaving proof of what they had done.</p><p>Now it was Agatha’s turn.</p><p>She sucked a mark into the curve of Rio’s neck, dragging her tongue over the bruised flesh, lapping, soothing, before moving lower, her mouth kissing, nipping, teasing over her collarbone—</p><p>And then, finally she closed her lips around Rio’s nipple.</p><p>Rio’s breath stuttered, her grip on Agatha’s thighs tightening, her nails digging in, her entire body tensing as Agatha sucked, slow and experimental, her tongue flicking, dragging, testing what felt best, learning her.</p><p>She felt the sharp inhale, felt the way Rio’s hips twitched, the way she let out a low, breathy moan, almost uncontrolled.</p><p>And fuck—Agatha liked it.</p><p>She liked knowing she had made that happen.</p><p>She liked seeing Rio come apart because of her.</p><p>Her teeth scraped lightly, and Rio jerked, her head tipping back, her voice breaking as she gasped out—</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha—”</p><p>Agatha grinned, dragging her tongue in a slow, wet circle before switching to the other breast, sucking there too, nipping, teasing, just to see if Rio would react the same way.</p><p>She did.</p><p>And fuck, Agatha felt powerful.</p><p>Rio’s breath staggered as Agatha’s hands finally slipped lower, fingers hooking into the waistband of her underwear, tugging at them, her nails dragging over the dip of Rio’s hip bones.</p><p>“You gonna take ‘em off for me?” Agatha murmured, pressing a slow, wet kiss to the hollow of her throat.</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, her control slipping, but her grin remained, though it was starting to look strained. “Bossy thing, aren’t you?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, lifting herself just enough to let Rio slide her underwear down and off, before pressing her palm between Rio’s legs.</p><p>Direct contact.</p><p>No teasing. No warning. Just pressure.</p><p>And—Jesus Christ—</p><p>Rio jerked, a wrecked, guttural sound tearing from her throat, her thighs tensing, her hips grinding up into Agatha’s hand instinctively.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach tightened at the reaction, heat flooding through her, pooling deep, low, heavy.</p><p>Because Rio Vidal—smug, cocky, unshakable Rio Vidal—was falling apart beneath her.</p><p>Agatha had never seen her like this.</p><p>Had never imagined this—</p><p>The way Rio’s head tipped back, exposing the long, elegant stretch of her throat, her lips parted on a moan, her chest heaving, her fingers clawing at Agatha’s thighs, gripping tight, trying to anchor herself to something—anything.</p><p>Agatha stared, entranced, her breath stuttering, her fingers flexing where they were still pressed against her.</p><p>This should have been the moment she took control.</p><p>She could have held Rio still, could have made her stay there, pinned beneath her, helpless—the way Rio had done to her earlier.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Because she wanted to see it.</p><p>She wanted to see what Rio did when she wasn’t holding back.</p><p>So when Rio moved—when she rolled her hips, grinding down against Agatha’s palm, setting her own pace, chasing her own pleasure—Agatha didn’t stop her.</p><p>She let her.</p><p>She let Rio use her, let her take what she needed, let her lose control completely.</p><p>And fuck, it was the hottest thing Agatha had ever seen.</p><p>The way Rio’s body moved, slow at first, testing the pressure, rocking against her, and then—faster, more urgent, more desperate.</p><p>Her breath hitched, her nails dug deeper into Agatha’s thighs, her body arching, her thighs shaking around Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha could feel how slick she was, feel how easily her fingers slid against her, coating them, soaking them, making everything hotter, messier, filthier.</p><p>And then—fuck—the sounds she was making—</p><p>Low, breathy moans, sharp gasps, little, wrecked whimpers every time Agatha’s fingers pressed harder,</p><p>Agatha felt like she was hypnotised, like she couldn’t breathe, like she was memorising this moment forever.</p><p>She let her fingers slip inside, slow at first, feeling the way Rio’s body clenched around them, tight and hot and perfect as she let out a deep guttural moan.</p><p>She rolled her hips deeper, her breath breaking, her body tensing, and then she was riding Agatha’s fingers in earnest, fucking herself on them, setting the pace, her moans growing louder, higher, needy, desperate.</p><p>She was chasing it—</p><p>Taking it.</p><p>And Agatha was letting her, curling her fingers every time Rio pushed down.</p><p>She let Rio use her, let her grind down, let her work herself up to the edge, let her lose it completely and it wasn’t much longer before Rio came undone.</p><p>Her fingers gripped Agatha’s thighs, hard, her stomach tightening, her body tensing, halting, and Agatha began moving her hand harder to try and keep the pace Rio had set, fucking her through it.</p><p>Rio's mouth fell open, a deep, broken moan tearing from her throat, her eyes squeezing shut, her hips jerking erratically, her thighs shaking violently as waves of pleasure crashed through her.</p><p>Agatha felt it all—</p><p>The way she clenched around her fingers, the way her breath stuttered, the way her body rode it out, writhing beneath her, wrecked and trembling.</p><p>And fuck, she was beautiful like this.</p><p>Agatha could only watch—</p><p>In awe.</p><p>In fascination.</p><p>In pure, overwhelming lust.</p><p>She had never seen someone come apart like this before.</p><p>Not like this. Not because of her.</p><p>And the realisation sent a violent shiver down her spine, made something deep inside her tighten, made her throat dry and her pulse hammer in a way that felt dangerous.</p><p>Rio was still panting, still shaking, her hands clutching at Agatha’s thighs and arm, her mouth parted, her eyes fluttering shut, the aftershocks still rolling through her, her body slowly grinding against Agatha’s hand.</p><p>And when she finally collapsed back, boneless, breathless, wrecked—</p><p>Agatha was breathless too.</p><p>Her head spinning.</p><p>Her body buzzing.</p><p>Her fingers still buried inside Rio, still slick, still warm.</p><p>She had felt every second of Rio’s undoing—</p><p>It was intoxicating.</p><p>It was addictive.</p><p>And it should have been over.</p><p>She should have been gloating, mocking, relishing the fact that she had turned Rio Vidal into a wrecked, panting, desperate mess beneath her.</p><p>Instead—</p><p>Rio was pulling her in.</p><p>A hand, gentle, steady, wrapping around the back of Agatha’s neck, guiding her down, closer—</p><p>But this time, when their lips met, it was soft.</p><p>It wasn’t filthy or hungry or devouring.</p><p>This kiss was slow.</p><p>Lingering.</p><p>It didn’t demand.</p><p>It asked.</p><p>Agatha felt her chest tighten, something thick and hot settling in her throat, something she refused to name, something she refused to acknowledge.</p><p>Rio’s lips were gentle, moving against hers in a way that made her ache, in a way that was dangerous.</p><p>Because this wasn’t just about fucking. It wasn’t about winning. It wasn’t about ego or control or who was on top. This was something else. Something unfamiliar. Something she had spent years keeping at arm’s length. And it terrified her.</p><p>She pulled back abruptly, her breath coming hard, her chest heaving, her skin flushed from exertion, but her mind reeling for an entirely different reason.</p><p>Rio was still watching her.</p><p>Not smirking.</p><p>Not gloating.</p><p>Just looking.</p><p>Something deep and unreadable in her expression, something Agatha <em>didn’t</em> want to see.</p><p>Didn’t want to understand.</p><p>Didn’t want to admit was real.</p><p>Her throat went dry.</p><p>She swallowed hard, blinking quickly, trying to shake it off, trying to breathe past it, trying to pretend it hadn’t happened.</p><p>But it had.</p><p>And they both knew it.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, forcing herself to move, forcing herself to shift away, ignoring the way Rio’s fingers twitched like she wanted to pull her back in.</p><p>Like she wasn’t done.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to sit up, to breathe, to gather whatever was left of her fraying composure. She could still feel the heat radiating off her skin, still feel the ache between her thighs, still feel the slick warmth of Rio’s arousal coating her fingers.</p><p>She should have been gloating.</p><p>She should have made some sharp, biting remark about how she had just wrecked Rio—about how smug, cocky Rio Vidal had just come apart on her fingers, gasping and desperate, completely at her mercy.</p><p>Instead, she was staring at the wall, refusing to look at her.</p><p>Because that kiss—</p><p>That kiss had been different.</p><p>And Agatha didn’t know what to do with it.</p><p>Her breath was still coming hard, her hands shaky as she finally pulled them away, wiping them half-heartedly against her own thigh.</p><p>She should get dressed.</p><p>She should get the fuck out of here.</p><p>“I have a bed, you know.”</p><p>Rio’s voice was hoarse, low, still wrecked from her orgasm, but there was something else in it too—something teasing, daring, and infuriatingly confident.</p><p>Agatha finally looked at her.</p><p>She was still spread out, still breathless, still shining with sweat, her skin flushed, her pupils still blown wide with something that wasn’t just lust anymore.</p><p>Her smirk was back, lazy and satisfied, but her eyes—those fucking eyes—</p><p>They still held that thing Agatha didn’t want to name.</p><p>She swallowed hard, ignoring the way her stomach twisted, and forced out something dry, something bored, something that wasn’t whatever the fuck she was feeling right now.</p><p>“Mm,” she hummed, stretching out her legs like she wasn’t still throbbing, still aching, still reeling. “You should’ve told me to stretch beforehand.”</p><p>Rio laughed, husky, low, still wrecked, but she didn’t miss a beat. “You complaining?”</p><p>Agatha snorted, reaching for where her shirt had been discarded on the floor, only for Rio’s fingers to catch her wrist before she could grab it.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, shifting, pressing her knees back into the couch as she leaned back in, hovering just over Rio’s still-spent body, crowding her, challenging her, using every inch of height she had to regain control of whatever the fuck this was.</p><p>The night didn't have to be over. </p><p>“You gonna lie there all night or are you going to show me where the bedroom is then?” she murmured, her voice steady, her pulse not. Of course she knew where Rio’s bedroom was. Her apartments layout was Agatha’s but flipped, but she wasn’t going to be the one to take them there.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered, heat firing behind them, and for a second, she looked like she might flip them over, take control, devour her all over again right there on the couch.</p><p>But then she exhaled, long and slow, her smirk turning into something smoother, calculated, and entirely daring.</p><p>She sat up, pressing her lips just beneath Agatha’s jaw, her teeth grazing the sensitive skin there, her hands already skimming down Agatha’s sides, making her shiver, making her burn before pulling back slightly and giving her a smirk.</p><p>“Follow me.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha lay there, staring at the ceiling, her body still humming, her pulse still erratic.</p><p>The room reeked of sweat and sex, the air thick and hot, the sheets a mess of tangled fabric and the lingering scent of Rio’s perfume mixed with tequila.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>Rio was draped over her, her bare skin still warm, breath slow and even, her body still flushed from everything they had done.</p><p>
<em>What the fuck just happened?</em>
</p><p>Her brain was moving at a million miles per hour, thoughts colliding into one another, but none of them made sense.</p><p>She was no longer buzzed, no longer hazy around the edges, no longer able to blame this on alcohol and poor judgment.</p><p>She had just fucked Rio Vidal.</p><p>For what felt like hours.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut. Jesus Christ.</p><p>She wasn’t gay. Right?</p><p>She wasn’t fucking gay.</p><p>She liked guys. She had only ever liked guys. But—</p><p>Her mind flashed, unbidden, to the way Rio had looked beneath her—</p><p>Writhing, breathless, head thrown back against the sheets, her throat bared, her hands clutching at Agatha’s arms, her back, her hair, desperate and needing—</p><p>The way her moans had broken apart in the back of her throat when Agatha pushed her onto the mattress, her knees pressing into the sheets, dragging her mouth down her body, tracing every dip, every freckle, every mark she had already left behind.</p><p>The way Rio had tangled her fingers in Agatha’s hair, had guided her lower, voice wrecked and pleading, whispering, "God, you’re such a tease—" before she had cut off with a gasp the second Agatha had latched onto her clit, sucked hard, and made her curse so beautifully she wanted to hear it again.</p><p>
<em>Oh, fuck.</em>
</p><p>Agatha turned her head sharply, trying to drown out the memories, but it was useless.</p><p>They kept coming. Kept dragging her back in.</p><p>The way Rio had flipped her over, straddling her hips, her thighs squeezing around Agatha’s waist, her nails digging into her stomach as she leaned down, voice thick with amusement<em>—"Gonna let me have some fun now, baby?"</em></p><p>The way Agatha had bitten back a moan, had clenched her jaw, refusing to let Rio get the upper hand—</p><p>But then she had.</p><p>She always fucking did.</p><p>The moment Rio had rolled her hips, grinding down, her skin slick and burning hot, her mouth pressed to Agatha’s throat, murmuring filth between teasing licks and nips—</p><p>Agatha had lost it.</p><p>Completely.</p><p>She had grabbed her, nails digging into Rio’s waist, had flipped them again, shoving her into the mattress, her body pressing her down, needing to reclaim control before Rio could turn her into a helpless mess all over again.</p><p>She remembered sinking her fingers inside her, slow at first, feeling Rio tighten around them, feeling the way she arched, how she had moaned Agatha’s name like she owned it, how she had whimpered when she didn’t move fast enough.</p><p>And fuck, the way Rio had begged—</p><p>
<em>"Please, Agatha. Come on, baby, don’t be mean—"</em>
</p><p>Agatha had almost laughed, had almost teased her for it, but the way Rio had ground down, chasing more, demanding it, her body a furnace, her lips kissing every inch of Agatha’s skin she could reach—</p><p>Agatha had given in.</p><p>Had fucked her hard, had pressed deep, curling her fingers just right, watching Rio fall apart, watching her come with her name on her lips, head tipped back, hair wild against the pillow, her thighs shaking around Agatha’s waist.</p><p>And that had only been the start.</p><p>They had gone again, and again, and again, until Agatha’s body ached, until she was marked everywhere, until her own moans had turned into shattered sounds she couldn’t even recognise, until her legs had shook so hard she could barely kneel, until the sheets had been drenched, until she had collapsed, spent, boneless, wrecked, with Rio grinning at her like she had just won a fucking war.</p><p>And now?</p><p>Now Agatha was paying for it.</p><p>The soreness. The heat. The way her skin still burned in all the places Rio had touched her.</p><p>Her breath shook as she pressed her palms into her face.</p><p>
<em>Oh my fucking God.</em>
</p><p>Beside her, Rio stirred, her body shifting, the warmth of her breath ghosting over Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Her voice was lazy, sleepy, still thick with exhaustion, but filled with smug amusement, like she already knew exactly what was going through Agatha’s head.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted violently.</p><p>She swallowed hard, trying to find anything to say, anything to distract from the fact that her body was still buzzing from Rio, from her mouth, her hands, her laugh, her fucking smirk—</p><p>"I—"</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>What the fuck was she supposed to say?</p><p>Rio shifted, lifting her head slightly, her dark eyes still half-lidded, but already gleaming with amusement.</p><p>Then, a slow grin spread across her face.</p><p>"Oh no," she murmured, smug as ever. "Is this your straight girl crisis?"</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened.</p><p>Her body went rigid.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>The words dug under her skin immediately, sending heat rushing to her face, her stomach coiling in something ugly and panicked.</p><p>Rio laughed, rolling onto her back, watching Agatha like she was the most entertaining thing in the world.</p><p>"Hate to break it to you, babe, but straight girls don’t do what you just did."</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched, her face burning.</p><p>"Don't call me babe."</p><p>Rio just grinned, her voice still mocking, still too goddamn casual, like this was nothing to her.</p><p>"Oh, now you’re gonna get defensive?"</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into the sheets, her breath coming too fast, her heart pounding.</p><p>She needed to get the fuck out of here.</p><p>Her clothes were still scattered across the lounge room, thrown somewhere between the couch and the floor in the chaos of the night.</p><p>She sat up abruptly, swinging her legs off the bed, ignoring the ache in her thighs, the familiar soreness of being fucked into oblivion.</p><p>Rio didn’t even look phased.</p><p>She stretched again, grinning, her voice lazy and teasing. "Running already?"</p><p>Agatha glared. "This—this was a mistake."</p><p>Rio snorted, tossing an arm over her head. "And there it is."</p><p>Agatha froze, her stomach twisting. "What the fuck does that mean?"</p><p>Rio smirked, sitting up, raking a hand through her messy hair.</p><p>"It means you’re about to do the whole ‘freak out and pretend this never happened’ thing."</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, her hands balling into fists.</p><p>"No, I’m not."</p><p>Rio let out a low, satisfied hum, clearly not buying it.</p><p>"Sure you aren’t, babe."</p><p>"Don’t call me babe!"</p><p>Rio just grinned, swinging her legs over the bed without a single ounce of shame, standing up completely naked like she wasn’t even thinking about it.</p><p>Like this was just a normal moment in her life.</p><p>Like Agatha wasn’t currently having an existential breakdown.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, tearing her eyes away, grabbing at the sheets to cover herself.</p><p>But Rio was already moving, strutting toward the door, completely unbothered, stretching her arms above her head letting Agatha see every mark she had left on her—bruises along her ribs, scratches down her back, bites along her hips.</p><p>She didn’t even look at Agatha before saying, "Come on, let’s go find your clothes."</p><p>Agatha scowled, hating how nonchalant she was, how unaffected she seemed.</p><p>Still, she followed, keeping the sheets wrapped tight around herself, her face burning as she stepped into the cooler air of the apartment.</p><p>Rio, of course, just walked right into the lounge, still naked, her stride easy, bending down to grab Agatha’s discarded shirt from the floor before tossing it toward her.</p><p>Agatha caught it instinctively, her eyes snapping to Rio’s smirking expression.</p><p>Rio tilted her head. "It’s bold of you to assume you can walk straight right now."</p><p>Agatha flushed hotter, yanking her shirt over her head.</p><p>"You are insufferable."</p><p>Rio hummed, picking up Agatha’s jeans next, holding them out of reach, grinning.</p><p>"And yet, you were just begging me for more, like, ten minutes ago."</p><p>"Oh my fucking God."</p><p>Agatha lunged for her jeans, but Rio just sidestepped, laughing, clearly enjoying this way too much.</p><p>Agatha grabbed the nearest pillow from the couch and chucked it at her head.</p><p>Rio dodged effortlessly, still grinning, still so goddamn smug.</p><p>"Alright, fine, fine," she said, tossing the jeans at Agatha. "Go have your straight girl crisis. But just so you know—"</p><p>Agatha paused, her pulse skipping, her fingers tightening around the fabric.</p><p>Rio’s voice was lower now, serious, even if her smirk still remained.</p><p>"This isn’t going away."</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>Her stomach flipped at the weight of those words.</p><p>Because fuck, she hated that Rio was right.</p><p>She yanked on her jeans, shoved on her boots and stormed toward the door, not looking back.</p><p>Agatha stormed down the short hallway, the door slamming behind her and her boots thudding against the worn carpeted floors, her pulse still pounding in her ears. Her entire body felt too hot, her skin buzzing, her mind still reeling from everything that had just happened. She just needed to get inside her apartment, close the door, and let the crushing weight of this monumental mistake settle in where no one could see her lose her goddamn mind.</p><p>Her apartment was right there.</p><p>Just a few more steps.</p><p>She reached her door, her fingers already going for her pocket—</p><p>And then she froze.</p><p>Her stomach plummeted.</p><p>The familiar jangle of her keys was missing.</p><p>She patted herself down, frantically shoving her hands into her pocket, then every possible pocket she could have used.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>No reassuring cold metal beneath her fingertips.</p><p>No clink.</p><p>No salvation.</p><p>
<em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>Her breath came sharper, her pulse hammering with a new kind of dread.</p><p>She had left her keys in Rio’s apartment.</p><p>Her entire body tensed.</p><p>Jaw locking, hands clenching into fists, she stood there, staring at her locked door, silently willing it to open on its own, as if sheer force of frustration would make it happen.</p><p>It didn’t.</p><p>Of course it fucking didn’t.</p><p>And now—</p><p>She had to go back.</p><p>Back to that fucking apartment.</p><p>Back to Rio.</p><p>Back to the one person she had just walked out on in a dramatic, self-righteous storm, and now had to ask for help like an absolute idiot.</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply through her nose, nostrils flaring, her fingers twitching at her sides as she debated her next move.</p><p>
<em>Maybe I can just sleep in the hallway.</em>
</p><p>Not the worst plan.</p><p>It wouldn’t be comfortable, but at least she wouldn’t have to deal with Rio’s insufferable ass again tonight.</p><p>But before she could make do on her plan, she heard the quiet click of a door opening and a familiar voice, smooth as silk and dripping with amusement, cut through the silence.</p><p>"Forget something, sweetheart?"</p><p>Agatha’s entire body locked up.</p><p>A sharp, bristling wave of second hand embarrassment hit her so hard she almost turned and walked in the opposite direction on pure impulse.</p><p>
<em>Fucking kill me.</em>
</p><p>She turned slowly, already scowling, already preparing for the wave of unbearable arrogance she was about to face.</p><p>And—of course.</p><p>There she was.</p><p>Rio leaned against her doorframe, <em>completely naked</em>, her arms crossed lazily over her chest, one hip cocked out just slightly in a way that was both effortless and calculated as hell. Her expression was pure, unfiltered smugness, lips curled in that infuriating half-smile, like this was the highlight of her entire night.</p><p>Agatha wanted to strangle her.</p><p>Or shove her back inside and slam the door shut herself.</p><p>But she wasn’t going to give her the satisfaction of a reaction.</p><p>She kept her voice level, biting, her jaw tight as steel. "Give me my fucking keys."</p><p>Rio’s smirk deepened, her dark eyes flashing with something dangerously entertained.</p><p>She tilted her head, raising a brow as if she were <em>actually thinking about it</em>.</p><p>And then—</p><p>"Hmm. No."</p><p>Agatha’s eye twitched.</p><p>Her breath stalled.</p><p>"What."</p><p>Rio stretched her arms above her head, muscles flexing in a way that made Agatha physically look away before she caught herself, scowling harder. "I don’t think I will."</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, aggressively, like it took every ounce of her willpower not to commit homicide in this goddamn hallway.</p><p>"Rio."</p><p>Rio’s smirk widened.</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>Agatha growled, stepping forward, reaching past Rio to get inside—</p><p>But Rio was quicker, twisting effortlessly, blocking the doorway with zero effort, her arms braced against the frame, standing in her full, insufferable nakedness, the very picture of smug defiance.</p><p>A fucking human roadblock of bare arrogance.</p><p>"Uh-uh," she tsked, grinning. "Not so fast."</p><p>Agatha glared at her, her fingers twitching at her sides.</p><p>"I swear to God, if you don’t give me my keys, I will—"</p><p>"You’ll what?" Rio cut in smoothly, brow arching. "<em>Throw another pillow at me</em>?"</p><p>Agatha’s fingernails bit into her palms.</p><p>She was this close to shoving her out of the way—but then she realised—</p><p>That’s exactly what Rio wanted.</p><p>She wanted Agatha to touch her.</p><p>She wanted to see if Agatha would get flustered, if she would look away, if she would react to the fact that she was standing there, completely bare, covered in bruises Agatha had put on her, looking like sin itself.</p><p>Agatha refused to take the bait.</p><p>Instead, she crossed her arms, her voice dropping into a tone so flat, so dry, so unimpressed it was practically suffocating.</p><p>"I had you screaming into my mouth less than an hour ago, sweetheart. If you think standing in front of me naked is going to fluster me, you really don’t pay attention."</p><p>Rio visibly faltered.</p><p>Just a fraction.</p><p>Just enough for Agatha to see a flicker of something heated, unprepared in her expression.</p><p>Then, just as quickly, Rio grinned, shaking her head, laughing under her breath. "Alright, I’ll give you that one."</p><p>Agatha held out her hand, expectantly. "Keys."</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t budge.</p><p>Then she sighed, dragging it out, acting like this was such a burden, and finally turned back inside, vanishing into the apartment like she was doing Agatha a huge fucking favour.</p><p>Agatha stayed rooted in the hallway, fuming, tension vibrating through her limbs, her blood pressure likely reaching deadly levels.</p><p>A moment later, Rio returned, dangling Agatha’s keys between two fingers, twirling them lazily, her smirk still firmly in place.</p><p>Agatha reached for them—</p><p>Rio yanked them back.</p><p>Agatha’s eye twitched so violently she thought she might have a stroke.</p><p>Rio beamed. "Say <em>please</em>."</p><p>Agatha stared at her.</p><p>A long.</p><p>Flat.</p><p>Unblinking stare.</p><p>Then, without breaking eye contact, she leaned in, so close their noses almost touched.</p><p>And in the lowest, most soul-drained, most aggressively deadpan tone possible, she said—</p><p>"Give me my fucking keys."</p><p>Rio laughed, tossing them at Agatha’s chest, making her fumble to catch them, and before she could snap something else, Rio just winked, muttering—</p><p>"Next time, just stay over. Saves us both the trouble."</p><p>Then she shut the door in Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha stood there.</p><p>Seething.</p><p>Her keys clenched tight in her fist.</p><p>Her heart racing for a reason she refused to acknowledge.</p><p>Then, without another word, she unlocked her door, stepped inside, and slammed it shut.</p><p>She was never sleeping with Rio Vidal again.</p><p>Never.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>…</p><p>Probably.</p><p>-</p><p>The next few weeks were awkward.</p><p>To say the least.</p><p>They hadn’t seen each other since that night. It was mostly by chance, but Agatha could admit—begrudgingly, only to herself—that she had been trying to avoid her.</p><p>Not because she was ashamed of what had happened.</p><p>No.</p><p>It wasn’t shame that made her linger inside her apartment when she heard someone moving around in the hallway. It wasn’t guilt that made her hesitate before leaving, ear pressed against the door for a second longer than necessary to make sure she wouldn’t run into her.</p><p>It wasn’t that.</p><p>It was because she didn’t want to think about the fact that her entire world view had just been flipped upside down.</p><p>She had been married. To a <em>man.</em> For fifteen years. That had to mean something.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>She couldn’t stop thinking about her.</p><p>She couldn’t stop replaying the sounds she had made, the way her body had felt against her own, the way her lips had dragged over her skin like she was something to be savoured.</p><p>She couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that maybe, just maybe, she wanted it to happen again.</p><p>It was fucking infuriating.</p><p>So, Agatha did what she did best.</p><p>She ignored it.</p><p>She <em>didn’t </em>think about Rio.</p><p>She didn’t think about her smirk, or her laugh, or the way she had whispered the filthiest things into her ear. She didn’t think about the way she had looked at her after, the way her fingers had lingered, the way—</p><p>Nope.</p><p>She absolutely did not think about any of that.</p><p>But as much as she tried to keep her distance, it was almost impossible.</p><p>They were <em>neighbours </em>after all.</p><p>But to Agatha’s surprise, Rio wasn’t being the annoying, no-boundaries, overly flirty neighbour that she had been before.</p><p>She seemed to be respecting her space.</p><p>Which was <em>good.</em></p><p>Or so Agatha told herself.</p><p>Because even though it was easier this way, even though it meant she could go about her day without dealing with Rio’s unbearable smugness…</p><p>She hated to admit it, even in the deepest, darkest corners of her mind, but she missed it.</p><p>She missed the way Rio would linger too close, the way she would find stupid excuses to talk to her, the way she would throw in some flirty comment just to get under her skin.</p><p>She had convinced herself that Rio was just a nuisance, just someone to tolerate, just an unbearable next-door neighbour.</p><p>So why did it feel so fucking empty without her?</p><p>Agatha scowled, shaking the thought from her head as she unlocked her apartment door, stepping inside.</p><p>She had just gotten home from work, and she was exhausted. It had been a long week not even considering the amount of shit she’s been getting from Lilia about her “poor mood”, and all she wanted to do was kick off her heels, pour herself a large glass of wine, and forget the world existed.</p><p>She hung up her coat, rolled her shoulders, rubbing the tension from her neck as she made her way into the kitchen.</p><p>But as she turned the corner, she froze.</p><p>"What the hell are you doing in my apartment?"</p><p>Rio was leaning against her counter, legs crossed at the ankle, looking perfectly at ease, a glass of wine already in her hand.</p><p>Agatha stared, her brain taking an extra second to catch up to what she was seeing.</p><p>Rio was… here.</p><p>In her kitchen.</p><p>Drinking her wine.</p><p>Like this was completely normal.</p><p>Rio lifted the glass, taking a slow, obnoxious sip, before giving her an easy, shit-eating smirk.</p><p>"What, a girl can't have a drink after a long day of work?" she asked, feigning innocence.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, her exhaustion momentarily replaced by a familiar rise of annoyance—but there was also something else.</p><p>Something she didn’t want to name.</p><p>Something that curled warm and traitorous in her stomach.</p><p>Relief?</p><p>Happiness?</p><p>She wasn’t about to admit that she missed this.</p><p>Missed her.</p><p>So instead, she crossed her arms, her voice dry as hell. "Oh, yeah? And what part of this involves breaking into my apartment? How did you even get in here?"</p><p>Rio grinned, swirling the wine in her glass. "Same way I always do."</p><p>Rio took another slow sip, her expression far too pleased with herself.</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply through her nose, fingers flexing at her sides. "Get out."</p><p>Rio pouted, placing a hand over her chest like she was offended. "You’re kicking me out? That’s rude."</p><p>"You. Broke. Into. My. Apartment." Agatha said, enunciating each word like she was explaining basic math to a toddler.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, lips twitching. "I prefer the term ‘welcomed myself in.’"</p><p>Agatha was this close to grabbing the wine bottle off the counter and throwing it at her head.</p><p>Instead, she let out a long, suffering sigh, pinching the bridge of her nose. "Rio."</p><p>"Agatha," Rio replied, mimicking her exact tone.</p><p>Agatha lowered her hand, leveling her with a flat, unamused glare. "Why are you here?"</p><p>Rio’s smirk softened—just slightly.</p><p>She took another sip, leaning further back on the counter. "I haven’t seen you in weeks."</p><p>Agatha’s stomach flipped.</p><p>She ignored it.</p><p>"Yeah. That was kind of the point."</p><p>Rio hummed, resting her chin in her palm, watching her closely.</p><p>Agatha wanted to argue, wanted to tell her to get out, to stop looking at her like that, to stop messing with her head—but the words got stuck in her throat.</p><p>Because even though she wanted to be mad, even though she wanted to kick her out…</p><p>She wasn’t.</p><p>Mad, that is.</p><p>Not really.</p><p>And Rio knew it.</p><p>The realisation made Agatha’s scowl deepen, her fingers tightening into the fabric of her blouse.</p><p>This was dangerous territory.</p><p>She needed to shut this down <em>now.</em></p><p>But Rio was still watching her, still smirking, still amused by her internal suffering.</p><p>And that—that was infuriating.</p><p>So Agatha took a step forward, grabbed the glass out of Rio’s hand, and took a long, slow sip before setting it on the counter with a decisive click.</p><p>Then, with her best, deadpan expression, she muttered—</p><p>"If you’re going to steal my wine, at least get the good bottle next time."</p><p>Rio’s eyes gleamed, her smirk stretching wide.</p><p>"Oh, sweetheart," she purred, looking entirely too pleased with herself. "Did you just invite me back?"</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, her fingers tightening around the stem of the glass before she finally released it, exhaling slowly through her nose.</p><p>This was exactly what she didn’t want.</p><p>The teasing. The push and pull. The way Rio was standing too close, radiating smug amusement, her body still too familiar, her scent still fresh in Agatha’s memory even after weeks apart.</p><p>Rio took a step closer, her movement casual, slow enough that Agatha could have stopped her if she wanted to. But she didn’t.</p><p>"So?" Rio murmured, voice smooth as silk, tilting her head just slightly. "Are we doing this, or are we pretending it never happened?"</p><p>Agatha felt the words like a physical shove—like Rio was deliberately testing her, seeing how far she could push before Agatha shattered.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know what she wanted the answer to be.</p><p>Her body sure as hell knew.</p><p>It remembered everything.</p><p>The way Rio had felt beneath her, above her, the way she had made her fall apart, the way she had laughed breathlessly into her skin, the way she had held her just a second too long after—</p><p>No.</p><p>Agatha shut it down.</p><p>She had spent weeks trying to bury that night, to file it away under reckless mistakes that didn’t need to be repeated. She wasn’t going to let Rio drag her back in just because she was standing in her goddamn kitchen, looking smug and knowing and so painfully attractive it made Agatha want to break something.</p><p>"There’s no ‘this,’" Agatha said finally, her voice flat, her arms crossing tightly over her chest. "It was one night."</p><p>Rio hummed, nodding like she was pretending to agree—but the amusement in her eyes told a different story.</p><p>"Sure," she said. "One night."</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched.</p><p>She didn’t like the way Rio said that.</p><p>Like she knew Agatha was lying to herself.</p><p>Like she was just waiting for Agatha to crack.</p><p>And maybe Agatha was.</p><p>She just wasn’t about to admit it.</p><p>Instead, she turned on her heel, grabbing the bottle of wine off the counter. If she had to deal with Rio’s unbearable presence, she was at least going to get properly drunk while doing it.</p><p>"Are you planning on staying?" she asked over her shoulder, pouring herself another generous glass.</p><p>Rio shrugged, leaning back against the counter again, looking obnoxiously at home in Agatha’s kitchen. "Dunno. You planning on letting me?"</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, bringing the glass to her lips, muttering nonsense into it.</p><p>She was tired. And irritated. And annoyingly relieved to see Rio again.</p><p>But she wasn’t thinking about why.</p><p>She took another sip, setting the glass down with purpose, before turning to face Rio head-on. "Why are you actually here?"</p><p>Rio’s smirk didn’t fade, but something in her expression shifted—subtle, but Agatha caught it.</p><p>A flicker of hesitation.</p><p>Like maybe this hadn’t been as spontaneous as Rio was pretending it was.</p><p>Like maybe she had thought about this a lot before walking through that door.</p><p>"I told you," Rio said smoothly, her tone light but not quite as careless as before. "Haven’t seen you in weeks. Wanted to know if you were still alive."</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. "I doubt you care that much."</p><p>Rio’s smile softened. "Oh, but I do."</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted at the way she said it.</p><p>Not mocking. Not teasing.</p><p>Just true.</p><p>It set off alarm bells in her head, but instead of pulling away, instead of kicking Rio out like she should, Agatha did what she always did.</p><p>She leaned in.</p><p>She let herself test the waters, just enough to see how far she could push before she had to stop herself.</p><p>"Well," Agatha murmured, taking another slow sip of her wine, her gaze flicking up to meet Rio’s. "If you were that worried about me, you could’ve knocked instead of breaking in."</p><p>Rio chuckled, her fingers drumming against the countertop. "Where’s the fun in that?"</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, exasperated, but before she could argue, before she could do something sane, Rio pushed off the counter and closed the distance between them in one unhurried step.</p><p>Not touching her.</p><p>Not crowding her.</p><p>Just close enough that Agatha could feel the heat radiating off of her, the faint smell of smoke and wine still clinging to her skin, the undeniable magnetism that had started this whole goddamn mess to begin with.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move.</p><p>She should have.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered over her face, eyes dark and searching, and when she spoke again, her voice was lower, quieter, edged with something Agatha didn’t want to name.</p><p>"Tell me you haven’t thought about it."</p><p>Agatha’s throat went dry.</p><p>She clenched her jaw, forcing herself to hold Rio’s gaze, even as her stomach coiled tight.</p><p>She wanted to lie.</p><p>She wanted to tell her to get the fuck out of her apartment and never come back.</p><p>Agatha's grip tightened around the neck of the wine bottle, her knuckles white.</p><p>She needed to say something.</p><p>Something sharp. Something biting. Something that would cut through the unbearable tension between them and put an end to whatever the fuck this was.</p><p>But her mind betrayed her.</p><p>It was supposed to be a blur—something buried, something she could chalk up to a drunken mistake and lock away in a part of her mind that she never had to touch again.</p><p>But instead—</p><p>It was vivid.</p><p>Like her body remembered before she could stop it.</p><p>Rio’s mouth. Everywhere. Dragging over her throat, biting down, sucking bruises into her skin until she was trembling.</p><p>The heat of her breath, the way she had laughed against her stomach, fingers pressing into Agatha’s thighs, spreading her open, murmuring something low and filthy before—</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Agatha inhaled too sharply, her breath quicker than before, her chest tightening—</p><p>And Rio noticed.</p><p>Of course she did.</p><p>Agatha should have expected it.</p><p>She should have known that Rio, with her stupid, perceptive, infuriating eyes, would catch the way her breathing had just hitched, the way the skin at the base of her throat had flushed warm, the way her pulse had started pounding too hard.</p><p>She didn’t even have to look up to know that Rio was smirking.</p><p>Like she already knew exactly what Agatha was thinking about.</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t say anything at first.</p><p>But Agatha could feel her gaze, sharp, slow, dragging over her like she was taking her apart piece by piece.</p><p>And then—</p><p>"You <em>are</em> thinking about it."</p><p>It wasn’t a question.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched around the bottle, her nails digging into the glass, her heart slamming against her ribs like it wanted out.</p><p>Lie.</p><p>Say something.</p><p>Deflect, fight, push back—</p><p>But she couldn’t.</p><p>Because her mind was still caught in the memory of Rio’s fingers sliding between her legs, the way she had felt hot, slick, the way Rio had moaned when Agatha had rocked against her, the way she had—</p><p>God, stop.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, something caught in her throat, something she didn’t know how to force back down.</p><p>And Rio—the smug, insufferable, sadistic little shit that she was—didn’t let up.</p><p>Didn’t step back.</p><p>Didn’t look away.</p><p>She leaned in, slowly, watching Agatha closely, her head tilting just slightly, like she was enjoying every second of this.</p><p>Like she was waiting for Agatha to break.</p><p>"Which part?" Rio murmured, voice smooth as honey, low and almost gentle—but that just made it worse. "Which part did you just think about?"</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered.</p><p>And that tiny, involuntary reaction was all Rio needed.</p><p>Her smirk deepened.</p><p>"Was it when I was on my knees for you?" she asked, softly, like it was just a passing thought, like she wasn’t dragging Agatha straight back into that memory with her.</p><p>Agatha’s throat went tight.</p><p>She refused to answer.</p><p>She refused to give her anything.</p><p>But Rio had already seen the way her jaw had clenched.</p><p>The way her pulse jumped.</p><p>The way her fingers tightened just slightly around the bottle, knuckles flexing, as if she needed something—anything—to hold onto.</p><p>And Rio, because she was cruel, because she was playing with her like a cat with a trapped mouse, kept going.</p><p>"Or was it when you had me beneath you?" she mused, her voice nothing more than a whisper of heat, curling around Agatha’s ears, dripping down the length of her spine. "When you pinned my wrists and made me beg for it?"</p><p>Agatha’s nails scraped against the glass.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>She turned sharply, too fast, taking a step away, toward the counter, needing space, needing to put something solid between them before she did something reckless.</p><p>But Rio didn’t let her escape.</p><p>Agatha barely made it half a step before Rio was behind her, moving with that same unhurried confidence, like she had all the time in the world.</p><p>Agatha could feel her presence before she even touched her—the warmth of her body just a breath away, the faint scent of smoke and wine curling around her senses, the way the air between them felt thick enough to choke on.</p><p>She should have turned around, should have shoved her away, should have put as much distance as possible between them before this spiralled any further.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Because she was stuck.</p><p>Rooted to the floor, her hands gripping the edge of the counter, her heart pounding violently against her ribs.</p><p>Rio’s breath brushed against Agatha’s ear, maddeningly slow, sending a sharp bolt of heat straight down her spine.</p><p>"I liked that," Rio murmured, her voice like smoke and sin, her tone so deliberately casual it was infuriating. "The way you took control."</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, her fingers tightening against the counter, her pulse slamming against her skin.</p><p>She wasn’t going to respond.</p><p>She wasn’t going to engage.</p><p>She was going to let Rio say whatever the fuck she wanted, and she was going to wait it out, let this moment pass, let the tension die on its own.</p><p>But Rio’s fingers skated lightly down her arm.</p><p>Barely there.</p><p>A ghost of a touch.</p><p>And Agatha’s entire body reacted.</p><p>A sharp inhale.</p><p>A full-body shudder that she couldn’t fucking control.</p><p>Rio laughed under her breath, just barely.</p><p>Soft.</p><p>Pleased.</p><p>"You liked it too," she whispered.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, her entire body rigid, every muscle in her legs locking up like she had just been trapped in place.</p><p>Rio’s fingers traced higher, sliding up the curve of Agatha’s arm, slow and teasing, like she was testing.</p><p>Like she was seeing how far she could go before Agatha finally broke.</p><p>"I can still feel your hands on me," Rio continued, her voice so low, so dangerous, so goddamn intoxicating, that Agatha had to physically stop herself from leaning back into it.</p><p>"The way you held me down."</p><p>Her fingers ghosted over Agatha’s ribs now, so light she wasn’t sure if she was actually feeling it or just imagining it.</p><p>"The way you moved against me."</p><p>Agatha's breathing was ragged, her heart slamming so hard she swore it would give her away.</p><p>She needed to shut this down.</p><p>Needed to—</p><p>"The way you made me beg."</p><p>Agatha snapped.</p><p>She turned sharply, grabbing Rio by the wrist, stopping her from touching her again.</p><p>Rio let her.</p><p>She didn’t pull away.</p><p>Didn’t even flinch.</p><p>She just stood there, still too close, watching Agatha with those dark, knowing eyes, the edges of her lips curling like she had already won.</p><p>Like she had already figured out everything Agatha was too afraid to admit.</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened.</p><p>Not enough to hurt.</p><p>Just enough to say—Stop.</p><p>Just enough to convince herself she was still in control.</p><p>Even though she wasn’t.</p><p>Not even a little.</p><p>Because Rio was smiling now, slow and lazy, like this was the exact reaction she wanted.</p><p>"Sensitive topic?" she murmured, tilting her head, her voice so unbearably pleased with herself that Agatha almost growled in frustration.</p><p>Her jaw clenched.</p><p>Her pulse roared in her ears.</p><p>She could still feel Rio’s body heat, still hear the lingering amusement in her breath, still smell her skin.</p><p>Still remember the marks she had left on her neck even if they were no longer visible.</p><p>And fuck—</p><p>She wanted to do it again.</p><p>Agatha’s grip loosened.</p><p>Rio’s smirk flickered just slightly, her dark eyes flicking down—not at Agatha’s hand, but at her lips.</p><p>And for a second—</p><p>For a single second—</p><p>Agatha thought she might actually kiss her again.</p><p>That she might give in.</p><p>That she might finally stop fighting it.</p><p>But instead—</p><p>She let go.</p><p>Abruptly.</p><p>Pushing Rio’s wrist away as she stepped back, breathing like she had just run a mile, willing herself to look unbothered, like she hadn’t just been two seconds away from grabbing her by the collar and shoving her against the nearest wall.</p><p>Rio didn’t follow this time.</p><p>She didn’t push again.</p><p>She just watched her, arms crossing loosely over her chest, that same goddamn smirk still playing at her lips.</p><p>"Coward," she murmured, shaking her head.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, her nails digging into her own palms, her teeth clenched so tight her jaw ached.</p><p>But she didn’t bite back.</p><p>Didn’t take the bait.</p><p>Didn’t give her the satisfaction.</p><p>Instead, she forced herself to turn away, grabbing the glass of wine she had abandoned earlier, bringing it to her lips, taking a long, steadying sip before finally muttering—</p><p>"I want you out of my apartment."</p><p>Rio hummed, like she was considering it.</p><p>Then, after a beat, she shrugged. "If that’s what you really want."</p><p>Agatha set the glass down forcefully. "It is."</p><p>Rio’s smirk widened.</p><p>"Liar."</p><p>And then, just as casually as she had appeared when Agatha found her in her kitchen, she turned and walked toward the door, not in a hurry, not in the least bit phased, not even looking at Agatha as she pulled it open.</p><p>She stepped over the threshold—</p><p>Paused—</p><p>And without turning around, without needing to see the way Agatha was probably burning holes into her back, she murmured—</p><p>"See you soon, sweetheart."</p><p>Then she was gone.</p><p>The silence in her apartment was deafening.</p><p>Agatha stood frozen, still gripping the counter, her pulse still pounding, her skin still burning from where Rio had been just seconds ago.</p><p>She clenched her jaw, inhaling deeply through her nose, willing herself to breathe normally, to calm down, to erase every trace of Rio’s presence from her mind.</p><p>But the damage was already done.</p><p>Her body knew.</p><p>Her body remembered.</p><p>And worst of all, her body wanted.</p><p>She swallowed hard, ignoring the insistent throb between her legs, the way her skin still felt too sensitive, the way her muscles still ached from holding herself so tense for so long.</p><p>She needed a distraction.</p><p>Something to pull her out of this.</p><p>She turned away from the counter abruptly, grabbing the half-empty bottle of wine and stalking toward the living room.</p><p>She dropped onto the couch, flicked on the TV, and immediately started channel surfing, barely even registering what was on the screen.</p><p>A crime drama.</p><p>
<em>Click.</em>
</p><p>A cooking show.</p><p>
<em>Click.</em>
</p><p>A romance movie.</p><p>
<em>Fuck no.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Click.</em>
</p><p>Nothing was working.</p><p>Because everything reminded her of her.</p><p>Every sharp inhale brought back the scent of smoke and wine lingering on Rio’s skin.</p><p>Every shift of her legs only made her more painfully aware of the heat pooling between them.</p><p>Every brush of fabric against her skin reminded her of bare hands, rough and wanting, dragging over her body like they had every right to.</p><p>She groaned, tossing the remote onto the coffee table with more force than necessary.</p><p>This was ridiculous.</p><p>It was infuriating.</p><p>And yet—</p><p>The longer she sat there, the longer the ache refused to go away, the more tempting a single, stupid, reckless idea became.</p><p>
<em>Go to her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Go across the hall.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Knock on her door.</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s stomach tightened at the thought.</p><p>It would be so easy.</p><p>She knew Rio would answer.</p><p>She knew Rio would smirk at her like she had been waiting for this exact moment.</p><p>She knew exactly how it would go—</p><p>Rio leaning against the doorway, amused, pleased, maybe still a little tipsy, her voice all mocking innocence when she said, <em>"Changed your mind already?"</em></p><p>And Agatha wouldn’t be able to lie.</p><p>Because Rio would see right through her.</p><p>And she would let her in.</p><p>And Agatha wouldn’t leave until the tension in her body had been wrung out of her completely.</p><p>She squeezed her thighs together involuntarily, her breath coming sharper at the thought, and fuck—</p><p>This was getting out of control.</p><p>She wasn’t going over there.</p><p>She refused to.</p><p>But the ache wasn’t fading.</p><p>The longer she sat there, the more unbearable it became—the tension coiling low and tight, relentless, refusing to go away no matter how much she willed it to.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, setting the wine bottle down with decisive force.</p><p>There was only one way to get rid of this.</p><p>She leaned back against the couch, rolling her shoulders, forcing herself to relax even as her heart pounded.</p><p>It wasn’t about Rio.</p><p>It was about her own goddamn sanity.</p><p>Her fingers drifted down slowly, tracing along the waistband of her pants, pausing for a second as she stared at the ceiling, willing herself to feel in control of this.</p><p>She wasn’t thinking about Rio.</p><p>
<em>She wasn’t.</em>
</p><p>But her body was.</p><p>Her breath caught as she slid her hand lower, her fingers finding heat, finding the undeniable evidence of everything she had been trying to ignore.</p><p>A shuddering sigh slipped from her lips, and fuck—</p><p>It had been too long.</p><p>Her body reacted instantly, her hips shifting into the touch, needy, desperate, aching for relief.</p><p>She kept her movements slow, deliberate, trying to pretend she wasn’t imagining another pair of hands, wasn’t hearing the way Rio had moaned into her mouth, wasn’t remembering the way she had come undone beneath her, breathless, begging—</p><p>Her fingers moved deeper, and a sharp gasp escaped before she could stop it.</p><p>Her free hand gripped the couch beside her, her thighs tensing as she curled her fingers, pressing into the places she knew would send her spiralling.</p><p>She bit her lip hard, her breathing turning uneven, the pressure in her stomach tightening, pulling, pushing her closer—</p><p>And that was when she heard it.</p><p>A sound.</p><p>A voice through the wall.</p><p>A soft chuckle.</p><p>
<em>Rio. </em>
</p><p>But it wouldn’t have been soft on Rio’s end. For it to be heard from where she was on her couch, she would have had to have been cackling like a damn <em>witch.</em></p><p>But it was enough to make Agatha’s entire body go rigid, her pulse hammering, her hand still between her legs and her breath caught mid-sigh.</p><p>She didn’t know if Rio had actually heard her.</p><p>Didn’t know if she was just imagining it.</p><p>But the timing was too perfect.</p><p>And that laugh. It wasn’t just casual amusement.</p><p>It was knowing.</p><p>Like she could feel the weight of Agatha’s frustration through the goddamn wall.</p><p>Agatha’s entire body flushed with heat, shame and irritation burning through her in equal measure.</p><p>She yanked her hand back, abruptly, sitting up too fast, her breath still shaky, unsteady, unsatisfied.</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair, exhaling sharply, trying to ground herself, trying to shove the overwhelming desire back down where it belonged.</p><p>But it wasn’t gone.</p><p>And neither was Rio.</p><p>She was right there, right next door, still in her apartment, still knowing too much, still getting under her fucking skin.</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, grabbing the wine bottle again, and took a long, steadying gulp, refusing to look toward the wall, refusing to acknowledge the way she could still feel Rio’s presence like a brand on her skin.</p><p>This was nothing.</p><p>She could ignore it.</p><p>She <em>would</em> ignore it.</p><p>Even if it killed her.</p><p>But the ache between her legs?</p><p>That wasn’t going anywhere.</p><p>And Agatha fucking hated her for it.</p>

<p>Agatha stared at her monitor, the cursor blinking in that maddening, mocking rhythm. A pulse of neon white against a sea of untouched black. Her fingers hovered above the keyboard, perfectly still, while her thoughts swirled in endless, directionless chaos. Thirty minutes—maybe longer—and not a single word had made it onto the screen.</p><p>It wasn’t that she didn’t know what to write. It was that every time she started to, Rio's face would invade the space behind her eyes. That smirk. That voice. That laugh that always sounded like it knew more than it let on. And then the memories would follow—visceral, intrusive, and now freshly reanimated.</p><p>She remembered how her thighs had ached the next morning.<br/>How her back had tensed every time she shifted too suddenly.<br/>How the marks left behind—bruises on her ribs, her neck, shallow crescent moons on her hips—had taken days to fade.<br/>She remembered standing in the mirror, tracing them with her fingertips, wondering whether she wanted them to disappear or stay long enough to make her bleed.</p><p>That was weeks ago.</p><p>And she hadn’t seen Rio since.</p><p>Not until yesterday.</p><p>Not until she found her in her kitchen—leaning against her counter like she belonged there, like it hadn’t been weeks of silence, like she hadn’t upended Agatha’s entire fucking world and then vanished. Rio had smirked like it was all a joke, like Agatha hadn’t been carefully rebuilding walls just to keep her out.</p><p>And now she was back.</p><p>Casual. Flawless. Dangerous.</p><p>All teasing glances and close proximity, her voice low and smooth, like she hadn’t left Agatha raw and reeling. Like she hadn’t whispered filth against her skin and then disappeared with a shrug and a wink.</p><p>Weeks.</p><p>Weeks of trying not to think about her.</p><p>And then she just showed up.</p><p>No warning. No apology. No shame.</p><p>Just Rio. In her kitchen. Stealing her wine. Tearing open wounds Agatha had only just started to ignore.</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw so tightly her molars ached.</p><p>She’d thought the silence would help. That distance would make it fade. But instead, it had bloomed. Grown into something tangled and sharp inside her ribs. Something that refused to be forgotten. Something that flared hot and mean every time she blinked.</p><p>She needed a reset.</p><p>She needed control.</p><p>
<em>She needed someone else.</em>
</p><p>Her heels echoed across the polished office floor as she made her way down the corridor toward the kitchen, jaw set, mug in hand, movements a little too sharp for someone just going to refill on caffeine.</p><p>She didn’t realise Lilia had spotted her until a voice floated lazily from the open doorway to her left.</p><p>“Damn, who pissed in your espresso this morning?”</p><p>Agatha paused, mid-step. She turned her head just enough to shoot a glare into Lilia’s office without breaking stride.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said flatly.</p><p>Lilia leaned back in her chair, one leg kicked up against the desk, iced coffee in hand, looking entirely too comfortable. “Sure. You just look like you’re about two seconds from declaring war on the Nespresso machine.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Her silence was answer enough.</p><p>She turned back toward the kitchen, her fingers tightening around the handle of her empty mug. There was a tension in her jaw, a heat behind her eyes, like the words she wanted to say were pressed against the back of her teeth, begging to be spoken—but she wasn’t about to give anyone the satisfaction of hearing them.</p><p>Behind her, Lilia called out again, voice sing-song: “Just saying, if you explode before lunch, I’m not covering your workload!”</p><p>Agatha flipped her off without looking back.</p><p>By the time she reached the kitchen, her hand was trembling slightly. She set the mug down on the bench a little harder than she meant to. Her reflection caught in the stainless steel of the microwave—flushed cheeks, sharp eyes, the tight line of her mouth. She looked like a woman barely keeping it together.</p><p>Which was exactly what she was.</p><p>She poured her coffee, took one sip, and walked it back to her office without acknowledging anyone else.</p><p>Once the door clicked shut behind her, she sat down, placed the mug beside her untouched keyboard, and pulled out her phone.</p><p>She didn’t think.</p><p>She didn’t weigh it.</p><p>She just acted.</p><p>She scrolled past her notifications. Past the work group chat. Past unopened spam messages she needed to delete, past the unread texts from her mother. And then-</p><p>
<strong>Ralph.</strong>
</p><p>Still there. Still available. Still harmless.</p><p>She opened the thread. Tapped a few times. Let her thumbs hover.</p><p>Agatha: <em>Are you free tonight?</em></p><p>She stared at the screen.</p><p>One minute passed.</p><p>Then another.</p><p>Ralph: <em>Uh, sure?</em></p><p>Her heart didn’t race. It barely moved.</p><p>Agatha: <em>I don’t want dinner. I want to have sex.</em></p><p>This time, the pause was longer. But not long enough to stop her.</p><p>Ralph: <em>Okay.</em></p><p>She locked her phone. Set it face down on her desk.</p><p>She didn’t smile. She didn’t breathe easier.</p><p>She just sipped her coffee, eyes unfocused, and told herself that this was the right thing.</p><p>That this would be enough.</p><p>That if she couldn't get Rio out of her head, she could at least get her out of her body.</p><p>-</p><p>The rest of the day passed in fragments.</p><p>Emails blurred into each other. Meetings came and went, her responses clipped and automatic, just enough to get by. Names were said. Deadlines mentioned. Jen cracked a joke in the breakroom that made someone snort coffee through their nose.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hear any of it.</p><p>Her mind was somewhere else. Everywhere else. Looping, always, back to that moment in the kitchen. The weight of Rio’s eyes on her. The way her smirk tugged, the low murmur of her voice curling like smoke in Agatha’s ears.</p><p>By the time five-thirty came, she was already halfway out the door.</p><p>The sky was bleeding orange when she got home. The apartment was dim and quiet, shadows stretching long against the floor. She didn’t bother with lights. She didn’t want clarity.</p><p>She dropped her bag at the door, her keys with a metallic clatter on the counter. Stood still for a moment in the hush. Listening to the sound of her own breath like it might tell her something she didn’t already know.</p><p>Then, methodically, she started to move.</p><p>The bathroom mirror caught her face, pale and drawn under the fluorescent light. Her eyes looked darker. Tired in a way that had nothing to do with work.</p><p>She turned the shower on scalding hot. Steam filled the room in seconds.</p><p>She stepped inside and scrubbed her skin hard—like she could scrape off the memory of Rio’s voice, Rio’s smirk, Rio’s fucking fingertips.</p><p>She shaved slowly, carefully, like control lived in the little rituals.</p><p>She washed her hair. Stood under the spray until her fingers pruned and her skin burned, and she was lightheaded from the heat.</p><p>She dried off in silence.</p><p>In her bedroom, she stood in front of the open wardrobe and stared for a long time. Her hand hovered over old T-shirts. A sweatshirt that still smelled vaguely like cinnamon.</p><p>She pushed them aside.</p><p>Black lace. Delicate, but sharp. A robe that clung in all the right places. No bra. No need.</p><p>It wasn’t for Ralph.</p><p>It wasn’t for anyone.</p><p>It was for herself. <em>For control</em>. For proof that she could still choose.</p><p>She sat at her vanity and did her makeup with the precision of a surgeon. Foundation. Concealer. Contour carved in shadows. Mascara sharp. Lipstick the colour of bitten fruit.</p><p>When she looked in the mirror, the woman staring back at her didn’t look soft. She looked like she could devour someone just to feel something again.</p><p>Which was the goal.</p><p>She poured herself a glass of wine. Sipped it slowly at the window, the glass cool in her hand, her eyes fixed on nothing. A car door slammed in the distance. Somewhere, a dog barked.</p><p>The world kept turning.</p><p>Her phone buzzed once.</p><p>She didn’t need to check it.</p><p>Ralph.</p><p>On time.</p><p>
<em>Of course he was.</em>
</p><p>She didn’t feel nervous. Or excited. Or guilty.</p><p>What she felt was relief. Cold and bitter.</p><p>Because this wasn’t about wanting.</p><p>It was about taking something back.</p><p>She moved to the door, each step calm, deliberate. Her robe swayed at her knees. Her heart didn’t race. Her fingers didn’t shake.</p><p>She opened the door.</p><p>Ralph stood there, smiling with that easy, eager look on his face. Hair combed. Shirt tucked in. He smelled like something mild and inoffensive—laundry detergent and aftershave.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something—probably something kind, something considerate.</p><p>But she didn’t let him.</p><p>Before he could speak, she grabbed him by the front of his shirt and hauled him inside. Her mouth crashed into his, all teeth and impatience, like she could bruise the words out of him before they landed.</p><p>He made a sound—small, startled—but didn’t resist. His hands came to her waist, light and tentative, unsure of where he was allowed to touch.</p><p>She pushed harder.</p><p>She needed him to shut up. To stop being gentle. To stop reminding her of what this was <em>not.</em></p><p>Her lips moved against his with force. Not passion. Not need. Just motion—just breath and pressure and distraction. Her fingers found his belt, undoing it with quick, impersonal efficiency.</p><p>She didn’t<em> want</em> to kiss him.</p><p>She <em>wanted</em> to erase the last few weeks with every breath she exhaled into someone else’s mouth.</p><p>His hands fumbled across her back. He tried to slow her down. His thumbs brushed her sides, a cautious stroke—meant to soothe. Meant to mean something.</p><p>She almost laughed.</p><p>Or screamed.</p><p>Instead, she tilted her head, bit his lip just enough to draw a hiss, and dragged her nails down his chest in a way that made him gasp.</p><p>
<em>Better.</em>
</p><p>She straddled him the moment they hit the bed. No hesitation. No delay. Her fingers curled in the fabric of his shirt, yanking it up and over his head in one swift motion.</p><p>He made a surprised sound—somewhere between a laugh and a breathless gasp—but, as expected, didn’t resist.</p><p>Of course he didn’t.</p><p>He let her guide the pace, the pressure, the rhythm.</p><p>Let her take control.</p><p>That was the point.</p><p>She didn’t want tenderness.</p><p>She didn’t want to be touched like she might break.</p><p>She wanted this fast and forgettable. Something that would fade before the sheets cooled.</p><p>Ralph’s hands landed on her hips again, reverent, unsure. Grateful. He looked up at her like she was something precious.</p><p>It made her skin crawl.</p><p>She leaned down and kissed him hard—just to quiet the noise. Just to keep her thoughts from unravelling into the places she didn’t want to go.</p><p>Just to forget.</p><p>This was just sex.</p><p>Just a body beneath hers. Just heat and movement and the sound of skin on skin. Just a way to drag herself back into the present.</p><p>But Rio kept sneaking in anyway.</p><p>A flicker in her mind—sharp teeth and a shit-eating grin. Fingers digging into her thighs. The low rasp of <em>“You gonna let me have some fun now, baby?”</em></p><p>Agatha’s rhythm faltered.</p><p>Her jaw tightened.</p><p>No.</p><p>No, not here. Not now.</p><p>She refocused. Ground her hips harder. Braced her hands on Ralph’s chest and set a pace that made him groan beneath her.</p><p>“Fuck,” he whispered, head tilting back. “You feel amazing.”</p><p>She didn’t answer.</p><p>Didn’t want to hear it.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to stay grounded—trying to feel his skin, his breath, anything that belonged to this moment.</p><p>But Rio was still there.</p><p>That smug fucking look.</p><p>The one that curled on her lips every time she knew Agatha was unravelling.</p><p>The way she tilted her head like she already knew exactly what Agatha wanted, before Agatha even did.</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered.</p><p>She hated that she remembered.</p><p>Hated that she could still hear Rio’s voice, teasing and low, curling into her ear like it had every right to live there.</p><p>She gritted her teeth.</p><p>Rio didn’t get to live here.</p><p>She didn’t get to haunt this too.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped open, her body moving faster now—sharper. Louder. She let a moan slip out, breathy and exaggerated, far more than she felt.</p><p>Let her hear.</p><p>If Rio was home, let her hear every fucking second of it.</p><p>She rolled her hips again, harder, dragged her nails down Ralph’s chest—not enough to hurt, but enough to make him gasp.</p><p>He groaned, voice strained. “Shit—Agatha, fuck, that’s—”</p><p>She didn’t care.</p><p>She let out another moan—louder this time, drawn out, deliberate. Teetering on the edge of theatrical.</p><p>She wanted it to carry through the wall.</p><p>She wanted Rio to hear it. To pause. To wonder if she was being replaced, rewritten, erased.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t true.</p><p>Even if she wasn’t chasing pleasure anymore—she was chasing proof. A performance for someone who wasn’t even there.</p><p>The only way she was getting off was by pretending.</p><p>Pretending it was Rio beneath her.</p><p>That sharp tongue. That smug little smirk. That maddening, perfect voice saying her name like it belonged to her.</p><p>She hated herself for it.</p><p>Hated Rio more.</p><p>And when release finally hit, it came with a sound that wasn’t pleasure at all.</p><p>It was defiance.</p><p>It was war.</p><p>And then—silence.</p><p>Heavy. Suffocating.</p><p>Not even the sound of breath.</p><p>Agatha sat perfectly still, thighs trembling, robe slipping off one shoulder, strands of damp hair clinging to her neck. Her palms rested flat against Ralph’s chest, his skin warm and damp beneath her hands, rising and falling in slow, steady waves.</p><p>She didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t blink.</p><p>Her heart was still racing—but not from satisfaction. From the sheer exertion of keeping it together. Of holding onto a version of herself she didn’t even like.</p><p>It wasn’t release. It was aftermath.</p><p>The kind that left her feeling hollow instead of whole.</p><p>She closed her eyes and inhaled.</p><p>Long. Deep. Controlled.</p><p>And for one second, she let herself feel the weight of it.</p><p>What she’d done.</p><p>What it hadn’t fixed.</p><p>The fact that it hadn’t helped.</p><p>Not even a little.</p><p>All of that noise. All of that performance. All of that movement meant to overwrite memory, to burn something new into her body—and it hadn’t worked.</p><p>Because by the end, it had still been about Rio.</p><p>The way she moved. The way she sounded. The way she looked at Agatha like she was the most fascinating thing on earth.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and exhaled, long and slow.</p><p>It did nothing to settle her.</p><p>Beneath her, Ralph stirred. One hand came up to her thigh, gentle. His other reached for her waist, slow and soft like he was handling something breakable.</p><p>She didn’t react.</p><p>Until he started to pull her down.</p><p>To hold her.</p><p>To <em>cuddle.</em></p><p>She felt it then—that sharp twinge in her chest. Not grief. Not guilt.</p><p>Disgust.</p><p>The way his fingers brushed over her side. The way he looked at her, all soft-eyed and open-mouthed like this meant something.</p><p>Like this had been about <em>them.</em></p><p>Her stomach turned.</p><p>Without a word, she shifted—pulled herself up and off of him in one swift movement. Not abrupt or rude.</p><p>Just done.</p><p>He blinked up at her, flushed and still catching his breath. “Hey…” he said, voice tentative, reaching for her wrist. “Are you okay?”</p><p>She didn’t answer.</p><p>She stood beside the bed, adjusting her robe, tying it tight around her waist like armour.</p><p>The sensation of Ralph’s skin on hers lingered, too warm, too familiar in a way that made her want to scrub her hands clean again.</p><p>She turned away from him, jaw tight, voice flat.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha stood with her back to him, her eyes fixed on some invisible point on the far wall. She could feel him still watching her—quiet, unsure, a question hanging between them that she had no intention of answering.</p><p>The air was too warm. The sheets smelled wrong. Her skin felt too soft in the places he’d touched.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “You should go.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Behind her, Ralph sat up slowly, confusion clear in the rustle of fabric and hesitation in his voice. “Oh… uh—okay. Yeah. Sure.”</p><p>He didn’t sound hurt.</p><p>Just surprised.</p><p>She didn’t look at him.</p><p>She stepped out of the bedroom without waiting, the soft padding of her bare feet making no sound against the hallway floor. In the kitchen, she poured herself a glass of water and downed half of it in one go, the cold shock of it doing nothing to clear the heat behind her eyes.</p><p>Behind her, she could hear him fumbling into his clothes. His belt clinking, fabric rustling, feet stumbling as he tried to remember where he’d left his socks.</p><p>She stayed in the kitchen.</p><p>Stared out the dark window above the sink, the faint reflection of her own face warped by the glass.</p><p>Still didn’t feel better.</p><p>Still felt haunted.</p><p>Finally, she heard him shuffle into the hallway behind her, fully dressed but awkward—like a kid leaving a sleepover too early. His shoes squeaked faintly on the floor. His jacket rustled as he pulled it into place.</p><p>She didn’t speak until she reached the door. “I’ll walk you out.”</p><p>He nodded, a little sheepish, hands stuffed into his pockets like they didn’t belong anywhere else. He lingered near the threshold while she unlocked the door, his fingers brushing the frame, body angled toward hers as if trying to find the right posture for goodbye.</p><p>When she turned to him, her expression was unreadable. Tired. Hollow. Her eyes dulled with the weight of a decision that hadn’t felt like one until now.</p><p>He smiled anyway. That same soft, harmless smile. “I had a really good time.”</p><p>Her stomach twisted. Just slightly. Like a knot she didn’t remember tying had pulled tighter.</p><p>She gave him a tight-lipped smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “Yeah.”</p><p>He hesitated. Shifted his weight. Then scratched the back of his neck, still smiling. “We should, uh… do this again sometime.”</p><p>Her hand tightened on the doorknob.</p><p>She didn’t answer.</p><p>She just opened the door.</p><p>And that’s when it happened.</p><p>The door next to hers creaked open.</p><p>She didn’t have to look.</p><p>She <em>felt</em> it.</p><p>That subtle shift in pressure, like gravity tilting toward something inevitable. The weight of Rio’s presence sliding under her skin like a knife.</p><p>Rio stepped into the hallway with a half-empty water bottle in one hand and a mesh laundry bag slung over her shoulder. Her hair was tousled, sleep-mussed. She wore an oversized band tee that hung off one shoulder and grey sweatpants loose around her hips. No makeup. Barefoot.</p><p>Effortless.</p><p>Unbothered.</p><p>Too real.</p><p>Her eyes found them imediately.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Ralph.</p><p>The robe.</p><p>The open door.</p><p>The silence that thickened like smoke in the space between them.</p><p>Ralph, oblivious, leaned in to kiss Agatha goodbye.</p><p>Just a quick press of lips to skin.</p><p>A gesture. Thoughtless. Meaningless.</p><p>But it burned.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught—caught halfway between rejection and surrender.</p><p>She froze, lips parted slightly, not because she was about to speak, but because she didn’t know what reaction would hurt less. Flinching away from Ralph, or letting Rio see it happen.</p><p>She didn’t lean in.</p><p>But she didn’t stop him either.</p><p>Down the hallway, Rio faltered.</p><p>She wasn’t frozen.</p><p>But she wasn’t moving, either.</p><p>She stood still, one hand braced on her doorframe, the other clutching the bottle at her side. Condensation dripped down her fingers.</p><p>Her face gave nothing away.</p><p>No smirk. No glare.</p><p>Just… watching.</p><p>Too blank. Too still.</p><p>It took Agatha a second too long to realise—Rio wasn’t prowling. Wasn’t lurking.</p><p>She was just doing her laundry.</p><p>This wasn’t planned.</p><p>It wasn’t a performance.</p><p>But it might as well have been.</p><p>Ralph’s lips lingered against the corner of her mouth.</p><p>She let it happen.</p><p>Because pulling away would mean explaining why she couldn’t.</p><p>But her eyes never left Rio’s.</p><p>And in that moment, something shifted.</p><p>Small. Sharp.</p><p>The twitch of a brow. The hard set of her jaw.</p><p>And then—Rio looked away.</p><p>First.</p><p>She turned her gaze toward the stairwell, adjusting the laundry bag over her shoulder with a quick jerk, the plastic rustling too loud in the narrow hallway. She didn’t speak. Didn’t make eye contact again.</p><p>Just walked past them. Quiet. Barefoot. Cool air curling around her as she passed.</p><p>And Agatha stayed perfectly still.</p><p>Like if she moved too suddenly, she’d break in half.</p><p>Ralph stepped back, satisfied, grinning a little to himself. “Alright, I’ll text you.”</p><p>Her mouth twitched. It might’ve been a smile. Or just restraint straining at the corners of her teeth.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>He gave a small wave as he headed down the hall, whistling something under his breath. Off-key. Happy.</p><p>Like this hadn’t just torn her wide open.</p><p>She closed the door behind him.</p><p>Gently.</p><p>Firmly.</p><p>Then she stood there.</p><p>Back pressed to the wood.</p><p>Heart pounding—not from Ralph.</p><p>From the fact that Rio had seen. Had looked away first.</p><p>Isn’t that what she had wanted?</p><p>Her hands were twitching at her side as she stood staring at the floor for a long time.</p><p>And then—suddenly, stupidly, without warning—her eyes burned.</p><p>She clenched her jaw, blinked hard, but it didn’t help. The heat stung anyway. Her throat ached.</p><p>A single tear rolled down, and she wiped it away before it reached her chin.</p><p>It didn’t matter.</p><p>The truth had already landed in her chest like a dropped weight.</p><p>
<em>She wasn’t straight.</em>
</p><p>Not even close.</p><p>But what if she wasn’t gay either?</p><p>What if it was just her?</p><p>What if this… <em>ache</em>—this hunger, this chaos—wasn’t something she could name?</p><p>What if it began and ended with Rio Vidal?</p>

<strong>Rio’s POV</strong>
</p><p>Rio dumps her laundry into the machine like it had personally wronged her. Her hands are shaking, and she’s mad at herself for letting it show. For freezing. For caring. For not smirking, not snapping, not saying anything. Not dragging Agatha’s smug little fake-moans out into the light and flaying them for what they were: a performance. Not for Ralph. Not for herself. But for Rio.</p><p>She slams the washer door shut with a little too much force. It bounces back before latching, like even the machine is rejecting her today. She shoves it again, this time with both palms flat against the metal, like she can push her frustration into it and lock it away with the clothes.</p><p>The hum of the washer starting up is barely audible over the blood pounding in her ears. She backs away, slowly, mechanically, like she’s forgotten how to move like a person and is just copying the idea of one. Her spine meets the cinderblock wall, cool and unmoving. She lets it catch her, sliding down it until she's on the cold tile floor, legs bent, arms draped over her knees like caution tape. Like a warning. Do Not Enter.</p><p>The room is dim. Harsh fluorescent lights overhead buzz like flies trapped in a jar. One of them flickers every few seconds, the kind of blink that makes your eye twitch even if you’re not looking at it. The walls are white—blank and sterile, like the inside of an institution. Not comforting. Not clean. Just indifferent. A colour you could scream into and never leave a mark.</p><p>She stares at nothing. At everything. At the dryer across from her, at the crusted detergent spill in the corner, at her own reflection distorted in the little chrome porthole of the machine she just fed.</p><p>Her face looks fine. Blank. Better than she feels. Her eyes aren’t red. Not yet.</p><p>She lifts the bottle of water she grabbed without thinking, takes a sip that tastes like nothing, like static, and sets it down beside her with the soft crinkle of plastic on tile. Water beads roll down its side and pool against the grout like the tears she’s refusing to shed.</p><p>She’s not crying.</p><p>She’s just breathing too hard.</p><p>She closes her eyes and sees it.</p><p>The robe. The open door. Agatha's makeup still perfect, like she'd applied it with military precision for someone who wasn’t Rio. Ralph with his fucking tucked-in shirt and aftershave that probably had a name like “Confidence” or “Golf.” The way Agatha hadn’t even flinched.</p><p>The way she had let it happen.</p><p>That kiss.</p><p>Not passionate. Not tender. Just <em>performative.</em></p><p>And somehow that made it worse.</p><p>Rio exhales through her nose. A slow, sharp breath, like she’s trying to slice the memory out of her own brain.</p><p>She should be furious.</p><p>She <em>is</em> furious.</p><p>But underneath the fury is a weight she can’t name. Something soft and aching and stupidly hopeful, like part of her still thought Agatha might come running after her. Say her name. Explain. <em>Apologise.</em></p><p>She laughs. Quiet and humourless.</p><p>
<em>Yeah, right.</em>
</p><p>Agatha Harkness doesn’t do apologies. She does control. She does smoke screens and damage control and sex like a fire alarm. She does everything except say how she actually feels.</p><p>Rio tips her head back against the wall. The concrete is rough through her hair. The flickering light overhead makes her lashes flutter involuntarily.</p><p>Her laundry has fifteen minutes left.</p><p>She’ll sit here for every single one of them.</p><p>Maybe longer.</p><p>Because upstairs? There’s a girl who made her feel like she was finally being seen. Then pretended she was invisible.</p><p>Down here? There’s no pretending.</p><p>Just fluorescent buzz, the churn of cheap machinery, and the quiet unravelling of someone who thought they could handle it.</p><p>The washer jerks into its final spin, the noise thrumming into her head like it’s trying to mimic a heartbeat. Too fast. Too loud. Too hollow.</p><p>Rio doesn’t move.</p><p>Her arms are numb where they’re curled around her knees, cheek pressed to the sleeve of her oversized band tee like it’s armour. It smells like detergent and maybe just the faintest hint of Agatha’s cinnamon shampoo from weeks ago. Or maybe that’s just her. Her memory playing tricks. Rubbing salt.</p><p>She closes her eyes again, slower this time.</p><p>Tries to rewind. To yesterday. To <em>before</em>.</p><p>Before the robe. Before Ralph’s hands. Before that kiss that wasn’t a kiss.</p><p>She’d thought she was being <em>decent</em>. Giving Agatha space. Time. Letting her breathe.</p><p>God, she’d <em>agonised</em> over it.</p><p>How long was long enough before she could reach out again? Would a text be too much? A meme? Something dumb, like “Your wine sucks but your face doesn’t”? Something <em>less</em> dumb, like “I’m sorry.” Because she was sorry. Not for what they did—but for vanishing after. Giving Agatha what she thought she needed.</p><p>She thought she was doing the right thing. Thought if she didn’t push, maybe Agatha would <em>choose</em> her. Not in a heat-of-the-moment, wine-soaked, shirt-off kind of way — but really choose her. Sober. Awake. Wanting.</p><p>Instead, she’d chosen Ralph. Ralph<em> Fucking</em> Bohner.</p><p>And the part that really stung? worse than the robe, worse than the kiss, was that Rio couldn’t tell if that was Agatha trying to <em>forget</em> her…<br/>…or <em>punish</em> her.</p><p>Was it the silence that made her snap?</p><p>Or was it seeing Rio again?</p><p>The look on her face yesterday when Rio leaned in toward her in the kitchen, all ease and smirk and nerves hidden under a hoodie, it hadn’t been anger. Not entirely. It had been panic. Like seeing Rio again had <em>jolted</em> something loose. Something Agatha didn’t <em>want</em> loose.</p><p>And maybe that’s what sent her straight into Ralph’s arms.</p><p>The thought makes Rio’s stomach twist.</p><p>She pulls her legs in tighter, resting her forehead on her knees.</p><p>
<em>I gave her space. I gave her every out.</em>
</p><p>She didn’t press after that night. Didn’t push. Even though all she wanted was to crash through Agatha’s door and say, <em>“Tell me it meant something.”</em> Even though she spent days playing their last conversation on loop like it was a voicemail that might sound different if she just listened harder.</p><p>She let Agatha Walk away.</p><p>But the second she stepped back into her orbit, Agatha ran.</p><p>Straight into safe hands.</p><p>Straight into someone who wouldn’t call her out or call her <em>home</em>.</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightens.</p><p>
<em>Did I do this?</em>
</p><p>Was seeing her again the last straw?</p><p>Had she undone all of Agatha’s carefully constructed denial just by showing her face?</p><p>She huffs a laugh against her knees. It tastes like dust and regret.</p><p>
<em>If I did this...</em>
</p><p>
<em>...then why the fuck do I still want her?</em>
</p><p>Why does it still feel like every cell in her body is tuned to the frequency of Agatha’s voice? Why does she still know, with crushing certainty, what Agatha looks like when she’s pretending not to care? Why does she still want to knock on her door, drag her away from Ralph and into the hallway and say, <em>“You don’t have to be afraid of me.”</em></p><p>Why does she still want to kiss her until that performative moan in the walls is replaced with the real thing?</p><p>Why does it still feel like <em>her name</em> belongs in Agatha’s mouth?</p><p>The washer slows to a stop with a final whine, its digital timer blinking: <strong>0:00</strong>.</p><p>Rio doesn’t move.</p><p>She watches the clothes settle in the drum like a body finally exhaling.</p><p>She wipes her face. There’s no tears to smear. Just heat. Just pressure. Just the kind of ache that makes your ribs feel too tight.</p><p>She presses her lips together. Stares down at her hands. At the red marks on her palms from clenching too hard.</p><p>She doesn’t know what comes next.</p><p>But she knows one thing:</p><p>She’s done chasing.</p><p>Let Agatha knock.</p><p>She won’t answer.</p><p align="center">

<strong>Agatha’s POV</strong>
</p><p>The third time Agatha heard Rio’s door shut before she could cross the hallway, she saw red.</p><p>Not the hot, wild kind. Not rage. No, this was something colder. Sharper. A slow, slicing panic that settled right under her ribs and made it hard to breathe.</p><p>Because it wasn’t a coincidence.</p><p>It wasn’t timing.</p><p>It was Rio.</p><p>Avoiding her.</p><p>On purpose.</p><p>Agatha stood there in the hallway with a bottle of wine in one hand and an excuse in the other, watching the closed door like it had just smacked her. Her jaw clenched. She knocked once—light, too light—then stepped back like it burned.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>She stared at the chipped paint near the doorframe. At the little scuff mark her boot had left there months ago when she’d nearly tripped laughing at something Rio said. Something Rio <em>smirked</em>, actually. Probably about her being clumsy. Or uptight. Or both.</p><p>God, she missed that smirk.</p><p>She missed all of it.</p><p>Even the parts she pretended not to.</p><p>The silence on the other side of the door stretched.</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose and walked back to her apartment before she did something pathetic, like leave the wine on the doormat with a note that said, <em>"sorry I’m the emotional equivalent of a natural disaster."</em></p><p>She didn’t leave the note.</p><p>But she thought about it. Like, really thought about it.<br/>Font choices. Pen vs. marker. Whether it was too much to draw a tiny storm cloud in the corner.</p><p>She hated herself a little for that.</p><p>Back inside, the wine hit the counter with a dull thud. She didn’t bother uncorking it. Just stood there in the dim kitchen, fingers flexing around the neck of the bottle like she could wring the shame out of it.</p><p>This was ridiculous.</p><p>It was a <em>door</em>, not a punishment.</p><p>The first time, she’d had a stupid excuse—mail in her hands, some vague plan to say <em>“this looks like yours”</em> even though it very much wasn’t.</p><p>The second time, she’d waited. Lingered in the hallway for a beat too long, pretending to scroll on her phone like she wasn’t trying to time their exits.</p><p>But the third time?</p><p>That one hurt.</p><p>Because she <em>knew</em> Rio had heard her. The shuffle of steps. The barely-there gasp she hadn't meant to let out. The way the air shifted right before the door clicked closed. Firm. Final.</p><p>And it hadn’t reopened.</p><p>Not even a crack.</p><p>Agatha pressed her palms to the edge of the counter and leaned forward, head down, eyes on the sink like it might offer divine clarity.</p><p>But all she saw was a wine glass from three days ago, crusted lip stain dried on the rim.</p><p>She’d been wearing that lipstick when she opened the door for Ralph.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Her stomach turned.</p><p>She braced harder against the counter. Her arms shook a little, too much tension in joints that used to move easily.</p><p>She should’ve gone after Rio that night.</p><p>She should’ve said something. <em>Anything.</em></p><p>But she hadn’t.</p><p>And now? Now the silence wasn’t protective. It was punishment. Deserved.</p><p>A mirror held up to every cowardly thing she’d done.</p><p>She used Ralph to feel nothing and ended up feeling <em>everything</em>.</p><p>The silence stretched for another day. Then another.</p><p>By Saturday morning, even Agatha couldn’t lie to herself anymore.</p><p>Which is how she ended up at a too-bright café across from Lilia. Sunshine kept catching on Agatha’s sunglasses, her fork, the dull knife she hadn’t used once. Her eggs were cold. Her coffee wasn’t strong enough. And everything tasted like regret.</p><p>Lilia was halfway through a croissant and an anecdote about some coworker’s deeply inappropriate spreadsheet naming conventions when she paused mid-chew. Her gaze flicked up, narrowing with surgical precision as she set her pastry down slowly.</p><p>She tilted her head. “Okay. What the hell is going on with you?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “I’m listening.”</p><p>Lilia gestured at her plate with the edge of her butter knife. “You’re dissecting that toast like you’re prepping it for autopsy. And you’ve sighed, like, four times in the last minute. Do you need a priest or a playlist?”</p><p>“You’re imagining things,” Agatha muttered, stabbing a piece of sourdough without any real conviction.</p><p>Lilia leaned forward, arms folded over the table. “You’re constipated with secrets. Spill.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, long and slow, then took a deep, unladylike gulp of her lukewarm coffee. It didn’t help. She stared at her plate like it might offer her a script.</p><p>Then: “It’s Rio.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyebrows did the slow, satisfied arch of someone who had just won a long-standing bet with herself. She leaned back in her chair, folding her arms across her chest like she was settling in.</p><p>“Ahhh,” she said, dragging the sound out like it tasted sweet. “There it is.”</p><p>“She’s ignoring me,” Agatha admitted, picking at her cuticle.</p><p>Lilia shrugged one shoulder. “Okay… and?”</p><p>“I deserve it,” she said, sharper now.</p><p>“Okay… <em>and?</em>” Lilia’s tone didn’t change, but her eyes were suddenly all steel under sunlight.</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, tipping her face toward the striped awning above like the sun might incinerate her if she asked nicely.</p><p>“I slept with Ralph,” she said. “Not because I wanted to. Because I didn’t want to<em> feel</em>. I think she heard it. Actually… I <em>wanted</em> her to hear it. And now she won’t even look at me.”</p><p>Lilia didn’t flinch. Just dabbed her mouth with a napkin and took a thoughtful bite of croissant, like this was a telenovela and she'd been waiting for the plot twist.</p><p>“So... you slept with Ralph.” Beat. “But you wanted <em>Rio</em> to hear it.” She nodded once to herself. Sipped her orange juice. Then froze.</p><p>“Wait—<em>back up.</em>” Her voice sharpened with delighted disbelief. “You slept with <em>Rio</em>?”</p><p>Agatha winced, eyes squeezed shut behind her sunglasses. <em>How did she even figure that out?</em></p><p>“Oh my <em>God,</em> I <em>knew it.</em> I <em>knew</em> something was going on. You two had the energy of a Jane Austen adaptation set in hell.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean for it to happen,” Agatha said, voice tight. She twisted the silver ring on her middle finger like she could rewind the moment.</p><p>“No one ever means for it to happen,” Lilia said, eyes gleaming now. “Except everyone always does.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her forehead to the table with a dull thunk. She didn’t lift it.</p><p>“Don’t make this worse.”</p><p>“I’m not. I’m making it honest.”</p><p>There was a pause, then Lilia’s voice shifted—quieter, more careful.</p><p>“Are you freaking out because you like her, or because you don’t know what it means about <em>you</em>?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice came muffled through linen. “Both?”</p><p>Lilia didn’t press. She nudged her juice aside, tapped one neatly painted fingernail against the rim of her plate.</p><p>“Okay,” she said. “Here’s what I know: you like control. You like labels. You like pretending everything is just fine, even when you're a human dumpster fire in designer boots.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, still face down.</p><p>“But you also like her,” Lilia continued. “And not just in a one-night mistake kind of way.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Agatha sat up slowly, dragging her fingers down her face.</p><p>“I think I broke it.”</p><p>Lilia leaned in, elbows on the table. Her voice was even, but her eyes were soft.</p><p>“Then fix it. Or let her go. But don’t stand there in the ashes and act surprised when she stops waiting for you to stop burning things down.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She just stared down at her plate like she might find forgiveness buried somewhere under a cold tomato.</p><p>-</p><p align="center">
<strong>Laundry Room, 11:43 PM</strong>
</p><p>The spin cycle hummed behind her. A low, relentless drone that filled the air like static. Agatha leaned over the dryer, stuffing damp clothes inside one at a time like she could fold her feelings into cotton and bury them under heat. Her hands moved automatically. Robotically. The motions were muscle memory, but her mind was anything but still.</p><p>
<em>Let her go or fix it.</em>
</p><p>That’s what Lilia had said. Fork poised like a dagger over her croissant, voice calm and merciless.</p><p>
<em>Either fix it. Or let her go.</em>
</p><p>As if it were that easy. As if there were a clean way out of this. A tidy little door marked <em>Closure</em>—not the jagged, splintered kind Agatha kept walking into, face first, over and over again.</p><p>She <em>wanted</em> to fix it. God, did she want to. But how was she supposed to do that when Rio kept vanishing every time she got within breathing distance? When the only thing Rio had offered since that night was her absence?</p><p>Agatha shoved a sweater into the dryer and paused, fingers tightening in the damp wool. Her jaw clenched. She hadn’t seen Rio in days. Not really. Just shadows. Movement. The sound of a door closing a second too soon.</p><p>Rio wasn’t giving her the chance.</p><p>It felt like punishment. But she wasn’t sure for <em>what</em>. Sleeping with Ralph? Making Rio hear it? Wanting her too much? Not wanting her enough?</p><p>She didn’t know anymore. All she knew was that she hadn’t slept properly in a week and every time she looked at her phone, she felt like she might scream.</p><p>What was she supposed to do? Chase her into the laundry room? Leave a note under her door? Carve <em>I’m sorry</em> into a bottle of wine and roll it across the floor like a desperate message in a very dumb bottle?</p><p>Agatha shoved another shirt in and blinked hard. Her chest ached.</p><p>Her fingers found the dial and twisted it. Too fast. Too forceful. The plastic clicked beneath her grip, each notch landing like a warning shot. A roulette wheel spun by a shaky hand.</p><p>And then she saw it.</p><p>Reflected in the warped glass.</p><p>A figure in the doorway.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Framed in the flickering light.</p><p>
<em>Rio.</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught mid-thought, mid-movement, mid-everything.</p><p>She didn’t turn. Couldn’t. Not with her pulse spiking, not with her grip locked around the dryer like it was the only thing keeping her upright.</p><p>But she <em>saw</em> her.</p><p>Tall. Barefoot. Laundry bag gripped tight. Face unreadable. Jaw clenched like it was the only thing holding her together.</p><p>Agatha’s hand went still on the dial.</p><p>She waited—for footsteps retreating, for the creak of the door opening, for the escape she’d come to expect.</p><p>But Rio didn’t leave.</p><p>She just stood there.</p><p>A statue carved from restraint.</p><p>Like the room had become a minefield, and she hadn’t yet decided which way to step.</p><p>Agatha watched her reflection—watched her shift, hesitate. Watched the slow flicker of recognition in Rio’s posture, her breath.</p><p>Then she moved.</p><p>One step.</p><p>Then another.</p><p>The door clicked shut behind her with a softness that felt louder than the slam from moments before and Agatha’s heart stuttered so hard she thought her ribs might splinter.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>Maybe. <em>Finally.</em></p><p>Her chance.</p><p>And still, she couldn’t turn around.</p><p>Couldn’t speak.</p><p>Because the silence wasn’t just awkward anymore.</p><p>It felt <em>loaded.</em> Electric. Pressurized. A single spark away from combustion.</p><p>Her body screamed at her—<em>say something, do something, be anything but silent</em>—but she stood frozen, locked in place by shame and want and fear.</p><p>Then—behind her—a breath.</p><p>A shift.</p><p>The kind of quiet that makes your skin prickle.</p><p>Rio was closer now.</p><p>She hadn’t spoken. Hadn’t touched her. Hadn’t even looked.</p><p>But Agatha could feel her.</p><p>Feel the effort it took for Rio to <em>not</em> look at her.</p><p>It hit harder than a slap would’ve.</p><p>That refusal to meet her eyes.</p><p>And that was what cracked her open.</p><p>She turned. Just enough.</p><p>Just enough to say it.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Not loud.</p><p>Not rehearsed.</p><p>Just honest.</p><p>It hung there between them, trembling on the edge of everything they hadn’t said.</p><p>Rio didn’t speak.</p><p>Didn’t move.</p><p>Still didn’t <em>look.</em></p><p>The silence closed in like smoke—hot, suffocating.</p><p>Agatha’s throat burned.</p><p>She took one small, careful step forward.</p><p>And that was when the lights flickered.</p><p>Once.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>And then darkness.</p><p>Just as Rio’s gaze snapped up and found hers.</p>

<p>The moment the lights cut out, the world exhaled.</p><p>The hum of the machines stopped mid-cycle. The overhead buzz silenced. Even the distant whir of pipes through the walls faded, like the building itself was holding its breath.</p><p>Total blackout.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse spiked. The kind of full-body jolt that came from too many horror movies and too much adrenaline. She blinked against the dark, like her eyes might adjust, but the laundry room had turned into a void. Thick. Silent. Swallowing.</p><p>Then a click.</p><p>A red emergency light sputtered to life in the corner.<br/>Dim. Flickering.<br/>Heartbeat slow.</p><p>And for half a second, she saw Rio.</p><p>Closer than before.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>The next flash cut across Rio’s cheekbone like a knife.</p><p>She was staring right at her.</p><p>And Agatha couldn't breathe.</p><p>Not properly. Not with the way Rio's gaze pinned her in place. Not with the heat curling low in her gut.</p><p>She hadn’t seen Rio look at her in days.</p><p>Not like this.</p><p>
<em>Not at all.</em>
</p><p>Another flash.<br/>Gone again.</p><p>Darkness swallowed the expression. But Agatha still felt it—like it had burned itself into the backs of her eyes. Her stomach flipped, sharp and sudden, as if her body understood something her brain hadn’t caught up to yet.</p><p>
<em>What is this? What are you doing? Say something.</em>
</p><p>Her lips parted, but her voice caught. She couldn’t tell if it was fear or hope or shame jamming up in her throat, but it lodged there like a stone.</p><p>
<strong>Flash.</strong>
</p><p>Rio had moved.<br/>Closer.<br/>Only a step, maybe two, but it was enough.</p><p>Enough to make the space between them feel electric.</p><p>No lights. No hum. Nothing but the blackout pressing in and still, Agatha could <em>feel</em> it.</p><p>A current buzzing under her skin, sparking in her chest, running down her spine like static before a storm.</p><p>Her heartbeat stuttered, then pounded. Loud. Erratic.</p><p>She was lit up from the inside.</p><p>And Rio hadn’t even touched her.</p><p>“Rio—” she tried.</p><p>But the name barely made it out.</p><p>It dissolved into the dark between flashes. Hung there, weightless, unanswered.</p><p>
<strong>Flash.</strong>
</p><p>Agatha's breath caught again. Rio was <em>right there</em> now. Standing in front of her. Not touching. Not speaking. But watching her with something unreadable in her eyes. Something hot. Something sharp.</p><p>Agatha felt her spine straighten instinctively, like posture could be armour. But her knees were weak. Her palms sweaty.</p><p>
<strong>Flash.</strong>
</p><p>The red light painted Rio’s jaw in crimson. Her lips parted, but no sound came.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. Hard.</p><p>She couldn’t stop shaking.</p><p>And when the light flashed again, Rio moved.</p><p>Not a reach.<br/>A shove.</p><p>Hard enough to knock Agatha back—but her hands didn’t leave.</p><p>She shoved with her whole body, palms on Agatha’s hips, driving her until her back hit the dryer with a metallic thud.</p><p>And then she was there.</p><p>Pressed against her. Following the motion like a closing door—like she’d been waiting for a reason to pin her there.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to catch her breath.</p><p>Rio was in her space. In her skin.</p><p>The light blinked out.</p><p>And the dark rushed in around them, thick as heat.</p><p>“Rio?” she breathed.<br/>Too soft. Too stunned.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Just breath.</p><p>Hot against her jaw.</p><p>And Rio’s body—<em>everywhere</em>. Chest to chest, hip to hip, knee slotted between hers like it belonged there. Like she’d earned it.</p><p>Agatha’s lungs seized. Her hands gripped the edge of the dryer tighter, knuckles white, as the faintest graze of fabric against fabric lit her nerves like fuse wire.</p><p>She couldn’t see a thing.</p><p>But she could feel <em>everything</em>.<br/>The press of Rio’s thigh. The scrape of a zipper. The twitch of muscle through cotton.</p><p>“What are you—” she started, voice cracking, useless.</p><p>
<strong>Flash.</strong>
</p><p>Their faces, inches apart.<br/>Rio’s eyes locked on her lips like they were the answer to a question she wasn’t ready to ask out loud.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth parted on instinct—</p><p>But Rio didn’t give her a chance to speak.</p><p>She didn’t even <em>hesitate</em>.</p><p>Darkness swallowed the room again and Rio <em>devoured</em> her.</p><p>The kiss landed like a collision. Hard. Wild. All heat and no warning.</p><p>Agatha gasped—and Rio <em>took it</em>.</p><p>Her mouth opened wider, tongue pushing in like she was starving for it, hands sliding from Agatha’s hips to her ass, yanking her forward so fast their teeth nearly clashed.</p><p>Agatha moaned into it, loud and wrecked, and that seemed to snap something in Rio.</p><p>She <em>growled</em>.</p><p>Actually growled.</p><p>Low and guttural and <em>hungry</em>, like Agatha was something she’d been denied too long.</p><p>Her grip turned punishing.<br/>Fingers dug into soft skin like she was trying to brand herself there, drag her closer, sink in.</p><p>Agatha let her. She <em>melted</em> into her.</p><p>Her back arched against the dryer, the cold biting at her spine while Rio pressed harder, deeper, one thigh wedging between Agatha’s legs and grinding <em>up</em>—</p><p>—like she already knew what she’d find.</p><p>Agatha cried out—sharp, helpless—and Rio swallowed the sound like it was her fucking oxygen.</p><p>The kiss got <em>uglier</em>.<br/>Sloppier.<br/>Tongues sliding. Teeth catching.</p><p>It wasn’t gentle. It wasn’t sweet.</p><p>It was a fight. A question. A scream.</p><p>And Agatha couldn’t stop kissing her back—<br/>Because it made sense.</p><p>Because everything else <em>hurt</em>.</p><p>Her hands flew up—first to Rio’s shoulders, desperate for something solid—then higher, clawing into her hair.</p><p>Fingertips scraped scalp. Nails curled tight.</p><p>Not delicate. Not gentle.</p><p>Like she didn’t know if she was holding Rio <em>closer</em> or trying to keep herself from falling apart.</p><p>Because this wasn’t steady.<br/>This was a landslide wearing a mouth and two furious hands.</p><p>Rio crashed back into the kiss—open, wild, consuming—like she needed to quiet something screaming in her head.</p><p>And Agatha kissed her back like she wanted to burn it down with her.</p><p>Because this was the only thing that made sense.</p><p>Because everything else was noise.</p><p>
<strong>Flash.</strong>
</p><p>Just long enough to catch Rio’s face—jaw clenched, brows pulled, lips red and raw.</p><p>Not just <em>wanting</em>—<em>fighting</em>.</p><p>Eyes half-lidded not from bliss but from restraint.</p><p>She looked like she was holding back a scream.</p><p>Or a sob.</p><p>
<strong>Dark.</strong>
</p><p>Rio’s hands yanked her closer like she was afraid she'd vanish.</p><p>Agatha whimpered—raw and involuntary—from the speed, the pressure, the <em>need</em> surging between them.</p><p>Her hips rolled without thinking—just a twitch, a grind—</p><p>But Rio felt it.</p><p>And pounced on it.</p><p>One hand dropped, sliding down, gripping her ass tight, pulling her against her thigh—<br/><em>Don’t stop now.</em></p><p>That was the message.<br/>No words needed.</p><p>Agatha broke the kiss on a gasp, head tipping back, chest heaving.</p><p>“We need to—<em>fuck</em>—we need to talk—”</p><p>But Rio’s mouth was already on her throat.</p><p>Biting. Dragging. <em>Erasing</em>.</p><p>Like the words were poison she refused to let Agatha speak.</p><p>Like if she heard them, it would all end.</p><p>So Agatha let her.</p><p>Let her suck a bruise into her pulse.<br/>Let her steal the breath right from her lungs.<br/>Let her make silence feel like mercy.</p><p>She let Rio push her.</p><p>Let her manhandle her back against the cold metal, hands everywhere—palms dragging over ribs, nails scraping skin beneath fabric, mouth open against her neck like she was trying to <em>drink her down</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s body arched into it. Into her. Into the chaos.</p><p>She swallowed the part of herself that whispered this was a mistake.</p><p>Because it didn’t <em>feel</em> like one.</p><p>Rio still didn’t make a sound.</p><p>Didn’t speak. Didn’t lift her head.</p><p>Just kissed lower.</p><p>Open-mouthed. Wet. Messy.</p><p>Like she wanted to mark her. Ruin her. <em>Claim</em> her.</p><p>And then her hands moved.</p><p>No fumbling now. No hesitation.</p><p>One slid between them, finding the front of Agatha’s pants—</p><p>Button popped.</p><p>Zipper dragged down in one swift pull.</p><p>No teasing. No patience.</p><p>
<em>Just access.</em>
</p><p>Agatha froze—just for a second. Just long enough to feel the rush of cold air on her thighs, the denim scraping down her legs.</p><p>Then Rio dropped them.</p><p>Shoved them down hard and fast, knuckles grazing skin, breath still hot on Agatha’s collarbone.</p><p>The denim caught at her knees, trapping her legs open, holding her there like a vice.</p><p>Vulnerable. Exposed. <em>Hers</em>.</p><p>Her breath caught—something between a gasp and a sob—</p><p>But Rio didn’t stop.</p><p>Didn’t give her time to protest.<br/>Didn’t give her time to <em>run</em>.</p><p>One hand stayed at her waist, pressing her into the dryer like she was trying to <em>melt her into the metal</em>.</p><p>The other slipped between her legs.</p><p>And Agatha’s head thunked back against the metal with a quiet, helpless <em>clunk</em>.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. Her lungs refused to cooperate.</p><p>She was soaked.</p><p>And Rio found it instantly—fingers brushing over the wet fabric of her underwear, dragging slow just once before pressing in harder.</p><p>Agatha let out a strangled gasp—sharp, high-pitched, completely unguarded.</p><p>Her hands shot up again, grabbing at anything—Rio’s shoulders, her hoodie, her hair—needing something to <em>ground her</em> before she shattered.</p><p>“Rio—” she breathed, voice wrecked, throat raw. “Please—”</p><p>But she didn’t know what she was begging for.</p><p>
<em>Stop.<br/>Don’t stop.<br/>Touch me harder.<br/>Make me forget.</em>
</p><p>And Rio didn’t ask.</p><p>She just pushed her hand inside her underwear.</p><p>Fingers sliding through slick heat like she already knew the way.</p><p>Like she’d never forgotten it.</p><p>Agatha’s whole body jolted, her knees almost giving out right there.</p><p>A groan ripped from Rio’s throat—low, guttural, <em>pained</em>.</p><p>It sounded like she hated how good it felt.</p><p>Agatha shuddered, hips snapping forward, chasing the friction like it was air.</p><p>Her hands fisted in Rio’s shirt—gripping, yanking, desperate for something to <em>hold her together</em> while everything else fell apart.</p><p>Her knees were buckling. Her lungs had stopped trying. And her chest—</p><p>Her chest ached like her heart had cracked open and started pouring out of her skin.</p><p>
<strong>Flash.</strong>
</p><p>Just long enough to catch Rio’s face.</p><p>Jaw tight. Lips parted.</p><p>Eyes glassy like she’d swallowed her own grief, and it was leaking out now, one breath at a time, against Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Then—dark again.</p><p>And Rio’s fingers <em>moved</em>.</p><p>Not tender. Not cruel.<br/>Just <em>deliberate</em>.</p><p>Sliding through her, down and<em> in</em> with a pressure so perfect, so maddeningly <em>known</em>, that Agatha’s whole body seized.</p><p>She let out a moan—choked, hoarse, high—</p><p>Not even pleasure yet. Just the shock of being touched like this.</p><p>“Fuck—<em>Rio</em>—” she gasped, barely getting the name out.</p><p>Still, Rio didn’t speak.</p><p>But she breathed against her neck—shallow, hitched. <em>Wrecked</em>.</p><p>And her hand—<em>god</em>, that hand—started moving with a pace that bordered on ruthless.</p><p>No easing in. No asking.<br/>Just taking.</p><p>Her other hand gripped Agatha’s hip, fingers digging in, holding her in place like she knew Agatha would try to run—or fall.</p><p>Agatha’s head dropped back again with a dull <em>thunk</em> against the dryer, hips canting forward in time with every stroke.</p><p>She was unravelling in Rio’s hands, and there was no slowing down.</p><p>She didn’t even realise she was crying until her lip trembled on a sharp inhale.</p><p>But she didn’t stop.</p><p>Couldn’t.</p><p>Because this wasn’t just about heat.</p><p>This was every word she never said.<br/>Every look she refused to hold.<br/>Every night she waited and <em>hoped</em>—and every night Rio didn’t knock.</p><p>All of it.<br/>All of it was in her now.</p><p>In the curl of fingers that knew where to press.<br/>In the silence between their gasps.<br/>In the way Rio didn’t pull away—even when it was too much.</p><p>Agatha fucked her hips into it—shameless, greedy, <em>gone</em>.</p><p>Each thrust was a confession.</p><p>Her mouth hung open, catching only fragments of breath.<br/>Her body rocked like it couldn’t decide between running and begging.</p><p>The room pulsed with red flashes, casting their shadows across the white walls in jagged, frantic motion.</p><p>She was gasping now—<em>broken sounds</em>, pulled from somewhere too deep to name.</p><p>Her thighs shook. Her jaw clenched.</p><p>And still she <em>moved</em>.</p><p>Matched her.<br/>Took her.<br/>Gave it all back.</p><p>Agatha’s moans got higher, shakier—torn straight from her chest, broken on the edges.</p><p>Her thighs trembled, desperate to spread wider, <em>give more</em>, but the denim caught around her knees held her open in that perfect, brutal trap.</p><p>“Rio—fuck—” she gasped, barely choking the name past her throat.</p><p>It was all she could say.</p><p>Because everything else had been ripped out of her.<br/>Her voice. Her control. Her goddamn spine.</p><p>The pressure was building fast. Too fast.</p><p>Her body wasn’t hers anymore, just tension and fire, strung tight around every ruthless curl of Rio’s fingers.</p><p>One more curl.<br/>One more thrust.</p><p>That’s all it took.</p><p>The release hit her like a fault line tearing open under her ribs.</p><p>Violent. Sudden. <em>Shattering.</em></p><p>Agatha cried out—loud, guttural, <em>helpless</em>—her whole body snapping tight as she clung to Rio like she might fall through the floor.</p><p>She dropped her face into the crook of her neck, muffling the worst of it against skin, but the sound still tore out of her.</p><p>A sob. A curse. A prayer.</p><p>And Rio <em>didn’t stop.</em></p><p>Her fingers kept moving—relentless and unflinching, dragging every last tremor out of Agatha’s body like she wasn’t letting her come down.</p><p>Wasn’t <em>letting her go</em>.</p><p>Her hand kept that rhythm—firm, certain, curling deep as if to <em>claim</em> every wave that tore through Agatha’s spine.</p><p>Agatha gasped, lips parting against Rio’s neck, hips jerking uncontrollably.</p><p>“God—Rio, please—”</p><p>It wasn’t a plea for mercy.<br/>It wasn’t <em>resistance</em>.</p><p>It was surrender.</p><p>Her hands fumbled blindly, fists curling in Rio’s shirt, nails dragging like she needed to <em>anchor</em> herself.</p><p>But her body kept chasing the rhythm even when her sob turned sharp.</p><p>Even when it stopped sounding like pleasure.</p><p>But Rio still held her.<br/>Still <em>fucked</em> her through it.<br/>Still gave her everything—<br/>Until finally—<br/>Finally—</p><p>Agatha broke.</p><p>One last wave crashed through her like a scream.</p><p>Her whole body jolted—hips snapping forward, thighs shaking so violently she nearly lost her footing.</p><p>She sunk her teeth into Rio’s shoulder, hard, just to muffle the sound that ripped up from somewhere too deep to name.</p><p>And then—collapse.</p><p>Her body went slack. Shaking.</p><p>Chest heaving.</p><p>Legs trembling between Rio’s and the cold, humming metal behind her.</p><p>The only thing keeping her upright was Rio.</p><p>The only thing keeping her <em>here</em>.</p><p>And only then—only when she had nothing left to give—did Rio slow.</p><p>Did her hand still.</p><p>But she didn’t pull away.</p><p>Rio didn’t speak.<br/>Didn’t move.</p><p>Agatha stayed where she was—folded into her, teeth no longer buried, just breath and sweat and skin pressed together like maybe if she stayed <em>still enough</em>, this wouldn't end.</p><p>Her forehead rested against Rio’s collarbone, the air between them heavy. Hot.</p><p>Too thick to breathe.</p><p>And that’s when the light came back.</p><p>It started as a low hum—like a warning.</p><p>Then a flicker.</p><p>Then <em>everything</em>.</p><p>Fluorescents flared to life overhead—too white, too sudden—burning through closed eyelids like a slap.</p><p>Agatha flinched, blinking against the sharp glare as sound rushed back in.</p><p>The machines stirred.<br/>The dryer behind her whirred up like nothing had happened.<br/>Like it hadn’t been the backdrop to her undoing.</p><p>And still, Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Her body was warm and solid and <em>there</em>.</p><p>Her hand was still between Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Fingers still inside her.</p><p>
<em>Still.</em>
</p><p>And Agatha couldn’t move.<br/>Could barely breathe.</p><p>She could feel it—her own body still pulsing around Rio’s fingers in slow, involuntary waves.</p><p>Like she hadn’t caught up.</p><p>Like some part of her was still coming.</p><p>She stared at the hollow of Rio’s throat, at the sweat shimmering under the brutal light, at the rise and fall of her chest.</p><p>At the hand that hadn’t withdrawn.</p><p>At the way Rio <em>held her in silence</em> like she hadn’t just torn her open.</p><p>No flickers now.<br/>No shadows to hide in.</p><p>Only this—</p><p>And the awful, tangled sound of their breathing.</p><p>And Rio’s silence.</p><p>Still deafening.</p><p>Rio moved first.</p><p>Her fingers pulled out in one slow, dragging retreat—slick and aching and <em>too much</em>—and Agatha’s whole body twitched.</p><p>She tried not to let it show.<br/>Failed.</p><p>Her breath caught. Her thighs trembled, still spread, still vulnerable.</p><p>Her pants hung low, twisted around her knees, underwear soaked and clinging.</p><p>Her heart pounded in her ears like her body hadn’t gotten the memo.</p><p>It’s over.</p><p>It’s over.</p><p>But it didn’t feel over.</p><p>Not when Rio’s hand brushed her thigh on the way out.</p><p>Not when it lingered—just a moment too long.</p><p>Then it was gone.</p><p>And Rio stepped back.</p><p>No eye contact. No softness.</p><p>Just silence and a breath that felt final.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach plummeted.</p><p>Her hands hovered in the air—useless, empty—before falling to her sides like she didn’t know what to do with them anymore.</p><p>She felt cold.<br/>Everywhere Rio hadn’t touched.</p><p>And <em>colder</em> where she had.</p><p>She blinked against the light, throat closing up.</p><p>Watched Rio wipe her hand on the front of her hoodie—absently, almost clinically.</p><p>Like it didn’t mean anything.</p><p>
<em>Don’t cry again.</em>
</p><p>Agatha reached down, hands shaking, dragging her pants up with jerky, clumsy movements.</p><p>The zipper caught.</p><p>She fumbled.</p><p>Didn’t look at Rio.</p><p>Couldn’t.</p><p>Her mouth opened. Closed.</p><p>Nothing came out.</p><p>Rio hadn’t moved far. Still facing the machines.</p><p>Shoulders stiff.</p><p>Spine straight.</p><p>Like she was bracing for impact. Or pretending she didn’t feel any.</p><p>Agatha pushed herself off the dryer, legs trembling like she’d just learned how to stand again.</p><p>She wobbled. Caught herself on the edge.</p><p>The metal was too warm.</p><p>Or maybe she was still burning.</p><p>“Rio—”</p><p>Her voice cracked like glass under a boot.</p><p>Barely a word. Barely breath.</p><p>And still—</p><p>Rio didn’t turn.</p><p>Didn’t flinch.</p><p>Just said, low and sharp and deadly clear:</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>The word hit like a slap.</p><p>Her chest squeezed.</p><p>Her eyes burned.</p><p>She felt everything she’d tried to swallow crawl right back up her throat.</p><p>She wanted to say nothing.</p><p><em>Knew</em> she should say nothing.</p><p>But the silence clawed at her. Pressed in around her throat like it wanted to choke her for what she'd let happen.</p><p>And something ugly—raw, defensive, cornered—spilled out anyway.</p><p>“Why are you acting like I cheated on you?” she snapped, voice sharper than she meant. “We weren’t anything.”</p><p>The words cracked across the room like a whip.</p><p>Louder than she expected.</p><p>Harsher.</p><p>Clumsier.</p><p>
<em>Weaponised in all the wrong directions.</em>
</p><p>The silence that followed was immediate.</p><p>Devastating.</p><p>The kind of silence that makes you wish you’d bitten your own tongue in half.</p><p>Rio didn’t turn.</p><p>But Agatha saw it—the change.</p><p>Her spine pulled tighter. Her jaw twitched. One shoulder rose, then stilled—like the sentence had physically struck her.</p><p>Because it <em>had</em>.</p><p>Of course it had.</p><p>And Agatha—god—she didn’t <em>mean it</em>.</p><p>Not like that.</p><p>Not the way it sounded.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The words were already in the air.</p><p>Already hanging there, sharp and echoing, impossible to take back.</p><p>Rio stood frozen, like if she focused hard enough, she could disappear.</p><p>Like maybe the machines would swallow her whole.</p><p>When she finally did speak, her voice was low. Brittle.</p><p>So quiet it barely cut through the buzz of the fluorescents.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said.</p><p>A beat.</p><p>Then—</p><p>“That’s the problem.”</p><p>She bent to grab her laundry bag without another word.</p><p>And walked out.</p><p>Not hurried. Not storming.</p><p>Just gone.</p><p>The door swung shut behind her like punctuation.</p><p>
<em>Bang.</em>
</p><p>Like a gunshot.</p><p>Like an ending.</p><p>Agatha didn’t think.</p><p>Her body moved before her mind caught up—off the dryer, out the door, every nerve in her skin screaming at her to do something. Say something. Fix this before it calcified into goodbye.</p><p>“Rio—” she called, breath sharp, voice ragged.</p><p>She caught sight of her halfway down the hallway—barefoot, laundry bag slung over one shoulder, walking like she hadn’t just gutted her in a basement.</p><p>Agatha’s feet slapped the tile. Loud. Sloppy. Desperate.</p><p>“Stop,” she said, louder. “Just—stop.”</p><p>Rio did.</p><p>But she didn’t turn.</p><p>Agatha closed the distance, heart pounding so hard it drowned out the buzz of the fluorescents above. She grabbed Rio’s wrist before she could think better of it.</p><p>Rio jerked out of her grip instantly.</p><p>“Don’t,” she snapped, the word a ricochet.</p><p>Agatha flinched. But didn’t back down.</p><p>“Just talk to me.”</p><p>Rio turned then—slow, controlled, eyes bright and wet and furious.</p><p>“You want to talk?” she said. “Now? After everything?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth. Shut it. Her throat was dry.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it,” she said. “What I said in there.”</p><p>Rio let out a laugh. One of those cold, flat, <em>fuck-you</em> laughs.</p><p>“Oh, cool. You didn’t <em>mean</em> it. Did you <em>mean</em> to fuck Ralph?”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned so fast she nearly choked on her own breath.</p><p>“That’s not—” she started.</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio snapped. “Don’t do that. Don’t stand here pretend that didn’t mean something.”</p><p>The hallway felt smaller than it should’ve. The lights above buzzed like insects. The air between them sizzled like it had teeth.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “I wasn’t trying to hurt you. I didn’t mea-”</p><p>Rio scoffed, interrupting. “You weren’t trying to do anything but forget me.”</p><p>That landed like a slap. Not because it wasn’t true—but because it was <em>too</em> true.</p><p>“You showed up,” Agatha said, voice rising. “You walked into my kitchen like nothing had changed. You disappeared for weeks and then showed up to steal my wine and made me feel like it was a joke to you.”</p><p>Rio stepped forward, eyes burning.</p><p>“Because I <em>missed</em> you,” she hissed. “Because I didn’t want to <em>push</em>. Because I was trying to give you <em>space </em>to figure your shit out without making it worse.”</p><p>Her hands clenched at her sides, shaking slightly. “And the second I came back—what did you do? You fucked the nearest warm body and <em>moaned loud enough for me to hear it</em>.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Agatha didn’t have an answer for that.</p><p>Because that was exactly what she’d done.</p><p>And they both knew it.</p><p>Her voice broke when she finally said, “I thought about you the whole time.”</p><p>The words hit the air like a confession and a curse.<br/>Bare.<br/>Unforgivable.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Her back went rigid, her fingers tightening around the laundry bag like she might throw it just to feel something.</p><p>Her face was unreadable, but her eyes weren’t. Her eyes were fire and grief and disbelief, all twisted into something Agatha couldn’t even name.</p><p>“Do you want me to thank you for that?” Rio asked, voice thin and deadly quiet. “Do you want a fucking<em> medal</em> because you couldn’t stop thinking about the person you were trying to erase?”</p><p>Agatha took a step forward before she knew she was moving. “I wasn’t trying to erase you—”</p><p>“You didn’t even call me!” Rio exploded, stepping into her space so fast Agatha actually flinched. “You didn’t text, you didn’t knock, you didn’t even <em>try</em>! And then I show up—and all I get is your back, and your wine, and the sound of you making someone else feel like he mattered!”</p><p>“I <em>couldn’t</em>—” Agatha’s voice cracked. “I didn’t know how to talk to you—”</p><p>“You didn’t want to.”</p><p>The words weren’t shouted.</p><p>They didn’t need to be.</p><p>Rio’s voice dropped into something bitter and exhausted.</p><p>“You didn’t want to talk,” she said. “Because talking means admitting it wasn’t just sex. And if it wasn’t just sex, then you’d have to face what that makes you. What that makes <em>us</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered in her chest.</p><p>Rio’s voice didn’t rise, but it trembled.</p><p>“And I’m not a fucking experiment,” she sounded exhausted. “I’m not your maybe. I’m not your midlife crisis or your exception or your fucking practice round. I wanted you. I <em>want</em> you. And you keep treating that like something dirty.”</p><p>Agatha felt like she might fall apart, right there in the hallway.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to—”</p><p>“But you <em>did</em>, Agatha!” Rio voice cracked sharp. “You meant <em>all of it</em>. Or none of it. And either way, I’m the one who has to live with it.”</p><p>The silence that followed stretched too long.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was barely a whisper when it came. “Then why did you just fuck me?”</p><p>Rio looked at her. Just looked.</p><p>“Because I’m an idiot,” she said quietly.</p><p>Then she turned.</p><p>And this time, Agatha let her go.</p><p>She didn’t chase her. Didn’t call her name.</p><p>Just stood there, skin flushed and damp, pants crooked, heart pounding like it hadn’t figured out she was alone again.</p><p>But this time, there was no one left to blame.</p><p>Just her.</p>

<strong>Agatha’s POV</strong>
</p><p>It had been two days.</p><p>Forty-eight hours since the hallway.</p><p>Since the dryer.</p><p>Since Rio’s voice cracked like it was holding back something fatal, and then—nothing. Just the sound of footsteps retreating and a door that didn’t close so much as <em>end</em>.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t gone to work.</p><p>She didn’t do that. She <em>never</em> did that.</p><p>Not for hangovers, not for breakups, not even for food poisoning that one time she’d passed out in the staff bathroom.</p><p>But this?</p><p>She couldn’t move.</p><p>Couldn’t fake a smile or return a client call or make herself get dressed like her entire body wasn’t still humming with the shape of someone else’s hands.</p><p>Someone who didn’t even want to look at her anymore.</p><p>She’d emailed in sick, then curled back into bed, still in the shirt she’d worn that night, and stared at the ceiling until the daylight changed colour.</p><p>Time had gotten weird.</p><p>She wasn’t eating. Wasn’t sleeping properly.</p><p>She kept thinking—<em>this is ridiculous.</em></p><p>It was just sex.</p><p>
<em>Twice.</em>
</p><p>Once while drunk. Once in a blackout.</p><p>That wasn’t supposed to <em>break</em> her.</p><p>And yet here she was, sitting on the closed toilet lid with a towel clutched to her chest like it might anchor her to the floor, the shower already running behind her and the steam curling up the mirror like it was trying to obscure her reflection.</p><p>She hadn’t looked herself in the eye since it happened.</p><p>She didn’t want to see the kind of person who fell to pieces over a girl. Over someone who was ten years younger.</p><p>Who touched her like she meant it—then walked away.</p><p>Who said <em>I want you</em> and still left.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know if she was heartbroken or just humiliated.</p><p>Maybe both.</p><p>Maybe she couldn’t tell the difference.</p><p>She kept thinking it should’ve been easy.</p><p>It was supposed to be fun. That’s what she told herself.</p><p>An experiment.</p><p>Dip a toe in. Get a story out of it.</p><p>But instead, it felt like she’d stepped off a cliff.</p><p>And Rio hadn’t caught her.</p><p>She wasn’t even looking.</p><p>Agatha ran a hand over her face. Her fingers were shaking. Her skin was clammy.</p><p>She felt pathetic.</p><p><em>You’re thirty-seven years old,</em> she thought. <em>Get it the fuck together.</em></p><p>She stood. Dropped the towel. Stepped into the shower.</p><p>The water hit her like a slap. Too hot.</p><p>She didn’t adjust it.</p><p>Just tilted her head back and let it run over her face as she held her breath until her ribs ached.</p><p>Maybe this would help.</p><p>Maybe it would strip something off.</p><p>The memory of her hands in Rio’s hoodie. The sound she made when she came. The way she couldn’t stop crying even as she moved against her like it was the only thing keeping her alive.</p><p>Maybe it would rinse away the shame. The guilt.</p><p>The truth.</p><p>That it hadn’t just been sex.</p><p>That it had felt like <em>more</em>—and that terrified her.</p><p>She scrubbed her hands over her face again.</p><p>Tried to breathe.</p><p>And that’s when she heard it.</p><p>The front door.</p><p>Opening.</p><p align="center">

<strong>Rio’s POV</strong>
</p><p>“You never should’ve touched her.”</p><p>That’s what Alice had said. Quiet. Firm. Not judgmental—but final.</p><p>“She’s not even gay, Rio. You were always gonna end up the punchline.”</p><p>Rio had laughed. Bitter and breathless and way too tipsy to fake indifference properly.</p><p>“Yeah, well. Joke’s on me, I guess.”</p><p>Alice had rolled her eyes. “You’re spiralling. Don’t do anything stupid. Just go home. Watch a movie. Block her for a week.”</p><p>Rio had promised.</p><p>Sworn up and down that she was done. That she was over it. That she didn’t even <em>want</em> answers anymore.</p><p>And then she’d gotten to her building.</p><p>Taken the stairs.</p><p>And stopped—of course—outside Agatha’s door.</p><p>She didn’t know why.</p><p>She just stood there. Swallowed by silence.</p><p>Two days, and the door hadn’t opened once. No music. No movement. Not a single shout or laugh or murder documentary echoing through the drywall.</p><p>It was just… still.</p><p>Like Agatha had vanished.</p><p>And Rio had convinced herself, in that foggy, wine-soft place in her brain, that maybe she really wasn’t home.</p><p>That maybe she’d gone away for a few days.</p><p>That maybe it would be fine to just… go in.</p><p>Just to leave something.</p><p>
<em>A note.</em>
</p><p>Something simple.</p><p>Something clever.</p><p>It used to be a joke between them—Rio slipping in through the front door like it was hers, grabbing wine, stealing snacks, leaving notes in the fruit bowl.</p><p>The key was still under the mat.</p><p>It always had been.</p><p>And Rio didn’t even think.</p><p>Her hand just moved—muscle memory.</p><p>Like this wasn’t a breach.</p><p>Like this wasn’t <em>different</em> now.</p><p>She slipped it free and let herself in.</p><p>The lights were low. The air inside warm. Familiar.</p><p>And it was <em>so quiet</em>.</p><p>That stupid voice in her head whispered again:</p><p>
<em>See? She’s not home.</em>
</p><p>But then—</p><p>The sound of the shower.</p><p>Soft. Steady. Real.</p><p>And Rio’s stomach <em>dropped</em>.</p><p>She froze. One foot inside, the other still hovering near the mat.</p><p>
<em>Fuck. She’s here.</em>
</p><p>And now Rio was trespassing. Drunk. Holding onto feelings she wasn’t allowed to have.</p><p>But she could still fix it.</p><p>Leave the note. Get out.</p><p>No harm, no face-to-face.</p><p>Rio drifted to the kitchen counter like her body was moving without permission. She opened the drawer, grabbed a pen, fished around until her fingers closed around an old receipt—crumpled, blank on the back.</p><p>She stared at it.</p><p>Stared through it.</p><p>What the fuck was she even trying to say?</p><p><em>“I miss you.”</em><br/>Too much.</p><p><em>“Still here, in case you forgot.”</em><br/>Too pathetic.</p><p><em>“I hate you.”</em><br/>Too honest.</p><p>None of it worked.<br/>None of it made sense.<br/>And all of it felt wrong.</p><p>She didn’t want to start a fight.</p><p>She didn’t want a conversation.</p><p>She just—</p><p>She just wanted <em>something</em>.</p><p>A reason. A thread.</p><p>Even if it was nothing like what she wanted, it would be better than this aching silence.</p><p>She hovered the pen over the receipt, hand shaking.</p><p>And then, without thinking too hard, she scrawled one word.</p><p>
<strong>
<em>Casual?</em>
</strong>
</p><p>It looked ridiculous the second she pulled her hand back.</p><p>Small. Weak. Stupid.</p><p>But it was honest.</p><p>Because if she couldn’t have the real thing—if she couldn’t be wanted the way she wanted Agatha—</p><p>Then maybe she’d take this.</p><p>A sliver. A shadow.</p><p>A version of her that didn’t hurt so much.</p><p>She could still get off and call it nothing.</p><p>She could pretend.</p><p>It was better than nothing.</p><p>And then—</p><p>The water stopped.</p><p>Everything in the apartment went dead still.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the pen.</p><p>She didn’t even have time to fold the note or set it down.</p><p>Because the bathroom door <em>slammed</em> open.</p><p>“What the FUCK—”</p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked through the hallway like a gunshot.</p><p>Rio turned just in time to see her—</p><p>Soaked. Furious.</p><p>Towel wrapped messily around her chest, hair dripping in wild tangles, eyes wide with full-on fight-or-flight panic.</p><p>One hand clutched a hairbrush raised high like she was about to bludgeon an intruder.</p><p>And when her eyes landed on Rio—</p><p>They didn’t soften.</p><p>They <em>widened</em>.</p><p>“Are you out of your <em>fucking mind?</em>” Agatha screamed. “What the hell are you doing in my apartment?!”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>Still holding the pen.</p><p>“I—”</p><p>Her mouth opened, but her brain hadn’t caught up yet.</p><p>Agatha was standing there like a Roman goddess mid-vengeance arc—dripping wet, wrapped in a towel that barely stayed up, hair clinging to her collarbone, breathing like she’d sprinted out of hell.</p><p>And Rio had broken in.</p><p>She had <em>actually broken in.</em></p><p>“I didn’t think you were home,” she blurted.</p><p>Agatha’s face contorted like that made it worse.</p><p>“Oh, so that makes it <em>fine?</em> Jesus, Rio—are you drunk?”</p><p>Rio flinched. “A little.”</p><p>“A <em>little</em>?”</p><p>The hairbrush was still raised.</p><p>“Put the brush down, Agatha—”</p><p>“Put the PEN down, you freak!”</p><p>Rio looked at the pen in her hand like she’d just noticed it was still there.</p><p>“I was gonna leave a note.”</p><p>“Are you <em>kidding</em> me?”</p><p>“Not like that,” Rio muttered, dropping the pen on the counter like it might defuse something. “I wasn’t—I wasn’t trying to…”</p><p>She trailed off.</p><p>Because what <em>was</em> she trying to do?</p><p>Her head was too warm. Her mouth too dry. Her pride barely hanging on by a thread.</p><p>“I was just…”</p><p>Agatha was glaring now. Still breathing hard. Still dripping all over the floor.</p><p>“You were just <em>what</em>?”</p><p>Rio looked at her. Really looked.</p><p>And it hit her all over again.</p><p>The curve of her throat. The sharp line of her collarbone. Her lips parted in outrage. Her chest rising with every furious breath.</p><p>Her towel had slipped a little. Not much. Just enough to drive Rio fucking insane.</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched.</p><p>
<em>This was not the time to be getting turned on.</em>
</p><p>Not with Agatha screaming.</p><p>Not when she was still dripping from the shower, red-faced and livid and shaking with the kind of rage that only came from feeling <em>hurt</em>.</p><p>But her body didn’t care.</p><p>Her body remembered.</p><p>The way Agatha had <em>sobbed</em> into her neck. The way she’d clung, gasped, begged—</p><p>And now she was standing there like a loaded weapon.</p><p>And Rio was too tired, too drunk, and too <em>fucking gone</em> to aim properly.</p><p>“I was just trying to leave a note,” she said finally, voice low, raw around the edges. “Okay? I wasn’t gonna talk to you. I wasn’t gonna do anything. I just—”</p><p>Her throat closed up for a second.</p><p>Agatha was already moving.</p><p>She surged forward—wet feet slapping on tile, one hand still clinging to the towel, the other reaching out like she <em>knew</em> something was waiting.</p><p>“No—Agatha—”</p><p>Rio’s hand darted out, trying to block her, but it was too late.</p><p>Agatha snatched the scrap receipt from the counter.</p><p>One word.</p><p>
<strong>
<em>Casual?</em>
</strong>
</p><p>Her eyes flicked down.</p><p>Read it.</p><p>And something in her face shifted.</p><p>Not rage.</p><p>Not confusion.</p><p>Just—</p><p>
<em>Hurt.</em>
</p><p>Quiet and precise and devastating.</p><p>Like the word had struck bone.</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped.</p><p>“I wasn’t—” she started, but the words choked off in her throat. “It was just—”</p><p>“Just what?” Agatha’s voice was barely a whisper now.</p><p>The note trembled between her fingers.</p><p>“You came into my apartment, drunk, to <em>offer me sex like it’s a favour?</em>”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly. “No, Agatha, that’s not—”</p><p>“You think I want that?” she said, voice rising. “After everything? You think that’s what I need?”</p><p>“I didn’t know what else to do,” Rio snapped. “You haven’t looked at me. You haven’t even <em>breathed</em> in my direction. And I missed you so much it made me <em>stupid</em>, okay?”</p><p>Agatha flinched like the words slapped her.</p><p>Rio raked a hand through her hair, heart pounding.</p><p>“It was pathetic,” she muttered. “Fine. You want the truth? That was me trying to have <em>something</em>, Agatha. Because I’d rather have the wrong version of you than nothing at all.”</p><p>The silence that followed was <em>loud</em>.</p><p>Not the cold kind.</p><p>The <em>humming</em>, heart-in-your-throat kind.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers slowly crumpled the note. Her chest rose and fell like she couldn’t decide whether to scream or cry.</p><p>“You’re such an idiot. You walked away from <em>me</em>,” she said, voice shaking.</p><p>Rio nodded, dead-eyed. “I know.”</p><p>Agatha dropped the note.</p><p>It fluttered to the floor between them.</p><p>It landed soft.</p><p>But Rio’s eyes snapped to it like it had screamed.</p><p>One little word, folded and crumpled. Still bleeding out between them.</p><p>
<strong>
<em>Casual?</em>
</strong>
</p><p>She didn’t look back at Agatha. Couldn’t. Her chest was tight, her skin hot with embarrassment, and everything in her wanted to run.</p><p>“Is that what you really want?”</p><p>Rio blinked, her eyes snapping up to meet Agatha’s.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, dripping water down her collarbone. “Casual.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, but it felt heavier than she meant it to. “I mean... I don't know. I just... I’d rather have something than nothing.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes searched her face like she was looking for a trick.</p><p>“So we would just... pretend it’s not what it is?”</p><p>“Hasn’t that been our thing from the beginning?”</p><p>That almost got a smile out of her. Not quite. But the corner of her mouth twitched like it <em>wanted</em> to.</p><p>“So what, we just hook up? No feelings?”</p><p>“Exactly. Feelings are banned. We’ll fine each other every time we accidentally care.”</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>“Twenty bucks a thought.”</p><p>“We’ll both be bankrupt in a week.”</p><p>“So we’re agreed.”</p><p>Another silence. This one... stupid.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms.<br/>The towel shifted.<br/>Rio’s eyes flicked down.<br/><em>Immediately</em>.<br/>Not subtle.</p><p>Agatha caught her. “Don’t look at me like that.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flew back up to Agatha’s eyes, caught. “Like what?”</p><p>“Like you’ve already mentally unwrapped me.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “You're in a towel. It's not that much of a mystery.”</p><p>“I swear to god—”</p><p>“You hate me, I know.” Rio’s mouth twitched. “But you’re still gonna come over.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “What makes you so sure?”</p><p>“I’m about to very responsibly prep,” Rio said slowly, turning toward the door. “With a very respectful strap-on.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened. “<em>That’s</em> your sales pitch?”</p><p>“Is it working?”</p><p>A pause. Long. Furious.</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio. Then at the door. Then down at her own towel like it had personally betrayed her.</p><p>“This is so fucking stupid,” she muttered.</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“<em>You’re</em> so fucking stupid.”</p><p>“<em>You’re</em> wet and yelling at me. It’s kind of working for me, not gonna lie.”</p><p>Agatha growled. “Shut the fuck up.”</p><p>“So, you coming over?”</p><p>She didn’t answer.</p><p>She just moved. Fast.</p><p>Straight to the door.<br/>Towel barely hanging on. Door swinging open. Feet pounding the hallway carpet. Mutters of <em>fuck fuck fuck</em> falling from her mouth like a spell she hated.</p><p>Rio barely had time to breathe before she started following her, closing the front door behind her.</p><p>“Oh my <em>goodness</em>!” A voice startled Rio into almost tripping.</p><p>Mrs. Bernstein.</p><p>Door cracked open across the hall, her cat peeking out between her ankles.</p><p>Agatha skidded slightly, tried to pull the towel tighter, but it was a lost cause—she was already halfway down the hall.</p><p>Rio nearly choked. “Shit—<em>Mrs. Bernstein!</em>”</p><p>The old woman gasped, hand fluttering to her chest like she'd just seen a crime.</p><p>“Don’t mind us!” Rio called back, jogging after Agatha. “Just… a plumbing emergency!”</p><p>“In a <em>towel?</em>”</p><p>“Yep! Serious leak. Very wet. Very urgent.”</p><p>Mrs. Bernstein’s mouth felt open.</p><p>Rio winced.</p><p>“Go back inside!” she hissed, pointing like she was warding off a vampire.</p><p>The old woman disappeared <em>so fast</em> you'd think she never existed.</p><p>Her cat meowed. Judgingly.</p><p>By the time Rio caught up, Agatha was already outside her door, glaring and red-faced and muttering something about <em>changing buildings entirely</em>.</p><p>“You’re banned from talking,” Agatha snapped, glaring.<br/>Rio snorted. “You say that every time.”<br/>“And every time, I regret not committing murder.”<br/>“Relax,” Rio said, unlocking the door. “You were already halfway to indecent exposure.”</p><p>Agatha shoved past her.</p><p>“Welcome,” Rio said sweetly, “to Casa de Bad Decisions.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look back.</p><p>She just walked into the dark like she knew exactly what she was doing.</p><p>Rio shut the door behind her.</p><p>And finally let herself grin.</p><p>
<em>She was so fucked.</em>

<strong>***</strong>
</p><p>The door clicked shut behind her.</p><p>Neither of them turned the lights on.</p><p>For a second, Rio just stood there in the dark, her hands braced on her front door.<br/>Breathing.<br/>Heart pounding like she hadn’t just sprinted across the hallway after a woman who’d already ruined her week. Twice.</p><p>Her coat was still on.<br/>Shoes too.<br/>She’d only just gotten home from drinks with Alice—a little buzzed, a little raw, still dressed like someone pretending she was fine.</p><p>She wasn’t.</p><p>She stripped off the coat and hung it up, kicked her boots off with two heavy thumps by the door.<br/>Then stood still, listening.</p><p>“Agatha?” she called softly.</p><p>She hated how small her voice sounded in the dark.</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>But there was a sound.<br/>A shift. A creak.<br/>Soft, barely there.</p><p>Farther in.</p><p>Rio followed it. Slowly. Barefoot, heart thudding, mouth dry.</p><p>Down the hall. Past the couch. Past the ghost of their first time.<br/>To the bedroom.</p><p>She pushed the door open, and her breath caught in the back of her throat.</p><p>Agatha was there.<br/>Sitting on the edge of the bed like she fucking owned it.<br/>Completely naked.</p><p>Towel discarded in a heap on the floor, like it had offended her.<br/>Her spine was straight, one leg crossed over the other, chin tilted just slightly like she’d been waiting.</p><p>Wet hair clung to her shoulders.<br/>Streetlight from outside sliced across her skin—cool and silver, catching the curve of her collarbone, the inside of her thigh, the sharp set of her jaw.</p><p>Rio’s heart stopped.<br/>Then started again—harder.</p><p>She didn’t know what she’d expected.<br/>But it wasn’t this.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look at her as she walked into the room, her gaze flitting around the dark room.</p><p>“Figured I’d skip the foreplay,” she said casually. “We’ve got a track record of fucking in places that make my back hurt.”</p><p>Rio stood in the doorway, suddenly unsure how to use her legs.</p><p>She took a deep breath and stepped inside.</p><p>The door swung partway closed behind her, soft and final. Closing away Rio’s doubts and letting her confidence come back to the surface.</p><p>“I’ll still make your back hurt,” she said. Her voice sounded steadier than it felt. “Just... in more <em>ergonomic</em> ways.”</p><p>She crossed to the bedside drawer.<br/>Didn’t look at Agatha. Couldn’t.</p><p>She opened it slowly.<br/>Saw it immediately.</p><p>Harness coiled tight.<br/>Strap next to it—clean, soft, waiting.</p><p>Like it had been waiting for <em>this.</em></p><p>She picked it up.<br/>The weight of it grounded her and made her breath catch all at once.</p><p>Turned back around.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were already on her.<br/>Fixed.<br/>Unblinking.</p><p>They dropped to the strap in Rio’s hand.<br/>And stayed there.</p><p>Didn’t look up.</p><p>And Rio—God—Rio felt it everywhere.<br/>Her stomach. Her throat. Her hips. Her hands.</p><p>She was buzzing with it.<br/>Need.<br/>Fear.<br/>Grief.</p><p>But she didn’t show any of it.</p><p>She straightened her spine. Tilted her chin.<br/>And let the smirk come.</p><p>Because if she let herself think too long—if she paused, even once—she’d remember what this wasn’t supposed to mean.<br/>What it <em>already</em> meant.</p><p>But Agatha was sitting there naked. Waiting.<br/>Like she didn’t care. Like she <em>could</em> do this.<br/>And if Agatha could, then Rio could too.</p><p>She tossed the strap onto the bed beside her like it was nothing.<br/>“Lie down.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Just like that?”</p><p>Rio stepped closer. “What, you want dinner first?”</p><p>“Maybe a drink? A contract signed in blood?”</p><p>Rio let out a low breath of a laugh, stepping closer.<br/>“You’re stalling.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked up—sharp, playful, dangerous.<br/>“I like to know what I’m getting into.”</p><p>Rio didn’t reply, her hands just went to the hem of her shirt, peeling it off slow, but not seductive.</p><p><em>Deliberate.</em><br/>Something about shedding the last layer of the night, of the lie she'd told herself at dinner, about being fine, made her feel <em>real</em> again.</p><p>The shirt hit the floor.<br/>The bra followed—black lace, barely doing anything anyway.<br/>Then her pants, inch by inch.<br/>Until she stood there, bare in the low light, skin warm, harness still untouched.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped. Lingered.<br/>She didn’t try to hide it.</p><p>Rio saw the way her throat moved when she swallowed.<br/>Saw the flex in her jaw, the sharp inhale, the way she tried to sit still and failed.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said softly. “You like this.”</p><p>“I like not being cold,” Agatha muttered. “Your place is freezing.”</p><p>Rio chose to ignore that remark, reaching forward and grabbing the harness from where she had dropped it on the bed.</p><p>She didn’t rush.</p><p>Stepped into the loops, one leg at a time, watching Agatha watch her.<br/>Pulled the straps tight. Adjusted the buckle.<br/>Ran a hand down the base—smooth, clean, steady.<br/>The silicone curved forward like a promise. Heavy. Solid.</p><p>Agatha stared at it. “I was begininig to think your smugness was gone.” She choked out, voice tight.</p><p>Rio smirked, her tongue poking into her cheek as she looked at Agatha.</p><p>She stepped in.</p><p>Close enough to feel the heat radiating off her skin.<br/>Close enough to make Agatha shift her weight, even if she tried not to show it.</p><p>She leaned down; one hand braced on the bed beside her thigh.</p><p>“You always this mouthy when someone else is in charge?”</p><p>“I’m not convinced you’re in charge.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said. “But you let me be.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.<br/>Didn’t deny it.</p><p>Rio smirked, fingers brushing lightly along the side of her thigh.<br/>She felt the shiver. The resistance. The tension held like a wire.</p><p>“Turn around,” she said, voice low. “Hands on the headboard.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You don’t give me much romance, do you?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched.<br/>Not quite a smile. Not quite not.</p><p>“There’s no romance in casual,” she said simply.</p><p>Then added, softer—meaner—</p><p>“And that’s what this is, right?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch.</p><p>But she didn’t answer either.</p><p>Just held her gaze for one long beat.<br/>Then turned.<br/>Faced the headboard.<br/>Hands planted.</p><p>She arched her back slowly, deliberately, like it was some kind of negotiation—like if she had to follow orders, she was at least going to make Rio lose her mind while doing it.</p><p>And it was working.</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched. Her hands itched.<br/>The harness was suddenly heavier, tighter against her hips.<br/>And Agatha was spread open in front of her like a challenge.</p><p>Not begging.<br/>Not soft.<br/>Just <em>daring</em> her.</p><p>Rio crawled onto the bed behind her.<br/>Ran her palms up the backs of Agatha’s thighs, over the curve of her ass, and then down again, slow and possessive.<br/>She spread her gently, thumbs parting her, and—</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She was soaked.</p><p>Already slick and warm and pulsing.<br/>Like she’d been ready for this since the door slammed behind them.</p><p>“You’re soaked,” Rio muttered.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, just let out a grown, pushing back into Rio.</p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose.<br/>Pressed her fingers in slow, knuckle deep, feeling how easily Agatha took her.</p><p>She still curled them slightly—just to hear the breath catch in Agatha’s throat.<br/>Just to remind her who was doing the fucking here.</p><p>“Just stretching you out,” she said, leaning in close, her breath hot against the small of Agatha’s back.</p><p>“Why?” Agatha gasped.</p><p>Rio smirked. “Because I’m not an asshole.”</p><p>A pause. Then, “Well. Not <em>that</em> kind.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a breath. “Debatable.”</p><p>But her voice was already changing—tight, breathy, like she didn’t know how long she could keep up the game.</p><p>Rio fucked her slowly with her fingers—two, then three—curling just right, building heat but never giving it fast enough.<br/>She wanted her <em>needy.</em><br/>She wanted her <em>wrecked.</em></p><p>She leaned in again, mouth brushing the space between Agatha’s shoulder blades.</p><p>“Rule one,” she murmured, Agatha clenching around her fingers. “No one else.”</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop.</p><p>She thrust deeper.</p><p>“You wanna be casual?” she said, breathless. “Fine. But if anyone else touches you—”</p><p>She fucked her harder, just once.<br/>Made Agatha’s hips jolt forward.</p><p>“—I’ll lose my fucking mind.”</p><p>The words spilled out before she could cage them.</p><p>And God, it felt <em>good</em>.</p><p>Agatha made a noise—something between a gasp and a laugh, wrecked and smug and teasing all at once.</p><p>“Jealousy’s not very casual of you,” she managed.</p><p>Rio pulled her fingers out—slow, wet, deliberate.<br/>Agatha shuddered.</p><p>“I’m not jealous,” Rio said, voice rough. “I’m possessive. Totally different.”</p><p>She grabbed the base of the strap.<br/>Pushed the head through Agatha’s folds wetting it before she lined herself up.<br/>Pressed it against Agatha’s entrance, not pushing in—<em>just there.</em><br/>Teasing.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, “I can feel you smirking,” she practically panted.</p><p>Rio didn’t reply, but she was definitely smirking as she pressed in.</p><p>Slow at first.</p><p>Agatha gasped—loud, involuntary, spine flexing as she tried to take it.<br/>She was already stretched, but the strap was thicker than Rio’s fingers, longer, heavier.</p><p>Rio held her hips.<br/>Steady. Strong.<br/>Felt the way Agatha trembled when she bottomed out.</p><p>“Still think I’m not in charge?” she asked, her palm flat against Agatha’s back, sliding up her spine until her hand curved over one shoulder. Holding.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.<br/>Didn’t have the air.</p><p>Rio smirked.</p><p>Then pulled back—slow, steady—until only the tip remained.</p><p>Agatha whined. <em>Whined.</em></p><p>“Rule two,” Rio said, voice like grit and gravel. “No kissing unless we’re fucking.”</p><p>She slammed in—deep, solid, single stroke. Her hand on Agatha’s shoulder pulling her back against her harder.</p><p>Agatha’s breath punched out of her like a sob.</p><p>Rio pulled back again.</p><p>“Rule three,” she breathed. “No sleepovers.”</p><p>Another thrust—harder.</p><p>Agatha’s hands scrambled for the headboard, bracing. Her back arched. Her knees slipped wider apart.</p><p>“God, Rio—”</p><p>“Rule four,” Rio bit, voice close to shaking. “We don’t talk about it the next day.”</p><p>She pulled back again.</p><p>Held. <em>Waited.</em></p><p>Agatha made a wrecked sound in her throat, hips twitching back like she could take it on her own. Like she’d <em>beg</em> if she had to.</p><p>But Rio didn’t move.</p><p>“Say you understand,” she demanded.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. “I—”</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>Another shallow thrust, just enough to tease the edge.</p><p>“Say you know what this is.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled tight around the wood. She turned her head just enough to speak, hair sticking to her cheek, mouth trembling.</p><p>“I get it,” she snapped. “No feelings. No sleepovers. No kissing unless I’m already too far gone to mean it. I <em>fucking get it.</em>”</p><p>She jerked back again—met Rio’s hips with a sharp slap of skin.<br/>“Now fuck me or <em>shut up</em>.”</p><p>That did it.</p><p>Rio snapped.</p><p>Her hands gripped Agatha’s hips so tight her knuckles went white.<br/>She pulled back, slammed in again—hard, unrelenting.<br/>Not teasing. Not testing.</p><p>Just <em>taking.</em></p><p>Agatha cried out—sharp, ragged, wrecked.<br/>Not pain. Not protest.<br/>Just the sound of <em>finally.</em></p><p>Rio’s breath was gone.</p><p>She moved like she had something to prove.<br/>Like if she fucked hard enough, deep enough, she could shove everything she was feeling <em>out of herself</em> and into Agatha’s spine.</p><p>“Don’t tell me to shut up,” she growled, thrusting again.<br/>Agatha moaned—loud, broken, gorgeous.<br/>“You don’t get to talk like that when you’re dripping all over me.”</p><p>Another thrust.<br/>Another hit.<br/>Another gasp.</p><p>The rhythm went brutal. Unforgiving.<br/>And still—Agatha pushed back into every stroke like she needed it <em>mean.</em></p><p>Like she needed to be ruined just to remember she was real.</p><p>Rio could barely breathe. Couldn’t think.<br/>Every snap of her hips was another vow she wouldn’t make out loud.<br/>Another crack in the armour she’d so carefully built.</p><p>Agatha’s thighs trembled beneath her.</p><p>“Fuck—” she gasped. “Harder—don’t—don’t stop—”</p><p>Rio didn’t.<br/>She couldn’t.</p><p>Her fingers dug in, teeth gritted, sweat slipping down her back.</p><p>The bed creaked. The headboard slammed once, twice, again.<br/>Agatha’s mouth dropped open in a soundless cry as her arms shook, muscles failing.</p><p>“Say it again,” Rio hissed.<br/>Another thrust.</p><p>Agatha moaned.</p><p>“Say you get it—say you fucking <em>get it</em>—”</p><p>“I get it—God, Rio—” Agatha choked. “I <em>get it</em>, I get it, I—<em>please—</em>”</p><p>The sound ripped right through Rio.</p><p>Because it wasn’t just begging.<br/>It wasn’t just want.<br/>It was <em>surrender.</em></p><p>And Rio was gone.</p><p>“Mine,” she snarled, fucking her so deep Agatha’s knees slipped.</p><p>Her hands fumbled, trying to stay upright, trying to stay <em>together</em>—but she was coming apart in real time, sobbing out breaths, crying out with every thrust like she couldn’t stop.</p><p>Rio reached up—fisted a hand in her damp hair.<br/>Yanked her back, not cruel, but <em>firm</em>, forcing Agatha’s spine into a deeper arch.</p><p>Agatha cried out, sharp and <em>obscene</em>, the sound punching straight into Rio’s chest.</p><p>“Say that too.”</p><p>“I—fuck—Rio—”</p><p>“Say you’re mine.”</p><p>Agatha choked on her own moan. “Yours—I’m yours—just don’t stop—don’t—”</p><p>Rio’s hand slid around.<br/>Down Agatha’s stomach.<br/>Lower.</p><p>And when her fingers found her clit, already soaked, already swollen and desperate—</p><p>Agatha <em>screamed.</em></p><p>No hiding it. No muffling.</p><p>A full-body, <em>wrecked</em> sound that echoed off the walls like a siren.</p><p>Rio growled behind her, hips snapping harder now, faster, fucking her through it while her fingers rubbed tight, fast circles, brutal and perfect and unrelenting.</p><p>“Come on,” she breathed. “Give it to me—fucking come for me—”</p><p>Agatha’s body jerked.<br/>Tensed.<br/>Then <em>broke.</em></p><p>She came hard—loud, shaking, breathless—hips thrashing, arms giving out, face buried in the mattress as the sound tore from her throat like it had claws.</p><p>Her body clamped down around the strap, slick and pulsing, and Rio adjusted her rhythm—deep, steady, dragging it out.</p><p>Letting her feel every inch.</p><p>Agatha sobbed into the sheets, twitching under her, thighs trembling as the orgasm rolled on—too much, too good, and nowhere near done.</p><p>Each slow thrust dragged a new sound from her mouth.<br/>Softer now.<br/>Wrecked.<br/>Raw.</p><p>Like she couldn’t tell where the pleasure ended, and the ache began.</p><p>Rio pressed a palm between her shoulder blades—steadying her, anchoring her—and rocked in once more, deep and slow.</p><p>Agatha whimpered.<br/>That high, breathless sound she only made when she couldn’t take any more but didn’t want it to stop.</p><p>Rio’s throat burned.</p><p>She should stop.<br/>She <em>should</em> stop.</p><p>But she didn’t. Not yet.</p><p>Not when Agatha was still shivering beneath her.<br/>Still open. Still gasping.</p><p>Rio leaned down—chest flush to her back, arm curling under to hold her against the mattress.</p><p>“Still with me?” she murmured against her ear.</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>Barely.<br/>A trembling little jerk of her chin, her cheek wet where it pressed into the pillow.</p><p>Rio kissed her temple before she could stop herself.</p><p>Not gentle. Not romantic.<br/>Just <em>reflex</em>.</p><p>And Agatha didn’t flinch.<br/>Didn’t push her off.</p><p>She just… lay there.<br/>Breathing hard.<br/>Shaking.</p><p>Rio stayed buried in her.</p><p>Chest against her back.<br/>Breath hot against her neck.<br/>Heart pounding like she’d just sprinted through traffic.</p><p>And still, Rio couldn’t pull away.<br/>Didn’t <em>want</em> to.</p><p>She just held her there.<br/>Anchored her.<br/>Tried to breathe through whatever the hell was happening to her chest.</p><p>Agatha mumbled something.</p><p>So soft it barely counted as sound.</p><p>Rio pulled her head back slightly. “What?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat against the pillow, voice hoarse, words slurred from the edge of aftershock.</p><p>“I think I saw God.”</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Agatha turned her head just enough to breathe, cheek still smashed against the mattress.</p><p>“Pretty sure she’s pissed at me.”</p><p>Rio let out a sound—half gasp, half laugh, all disbelief.</p><p>It cracked out of her like lightning—quick and sharp, like it caught her off guard.</p><p>Agatha made a noise that might’ve been smug if she wasn’t still trembling.<br/>Still twitching under Rio like her body hadn’t figured out it was over.</p><p>Which—<br/>It wasn’t.</p><p>Rio felt the twitch of her hips. The echo of need still pulsing through her.</p><p>“Fuck, I-,” she cut herself off with a chuckle, her head falling back against Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha made a humming sound, lips barely moving.</p><p>And then she shifted again.</p><p>That small, defiant rock of her hips.<br/>A challenge. A dare.</p><p>Rio felt it all the way down to her toes.</p><p>“You want more,” she stated. Not a question.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was wrecked, but smug, “Mm. Still casual.”</p><p>“You can barely breathe.”</p><p>“Didn’t say I wanted it easy.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched.</p><p>Her pulse <em>spiked.</em><br/>She pulled out.</p><p>Agatha whimpered. A real, broken, frustrated sound.</p><p>But before she could shift, Rio moved—fast and sure.<br/>She grabbed her by the hips, flipped her over, rolled her onto her back like she weighed nothing, like she was hers to move.</p><p>Agatha landed on the pillows with a soft gasp, blinking up at her, lips parted, dazed and shining in the low light.</p><p>Rio climbed over her slowly, gaze trailing across flushed skin and heaving breath. Beautiful. Wrecked.</p><p>She braced her knees between Agatha’s thighs, the harness pressing firm and hot against her own skin.</p><p>One hand slid up to catch Agatha’s wrist—pinning it gently into the sheets, not forceful, but final.</p><p>She leaned down, the strap dragging between them, heavy with intent.</p><p>No smile.</p><p>Just a voice, low and wrecked:</p><p>“Rule five.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “What now?”</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>“Safeword,” she said.</p><p>Agatha went still.</p><p>Completely still.</p><p>Rio’s voice didn’t waver. “I don’t care how casual this is. I don’t care how many rules we make. That one’s real. You don’t say it, I don’t stop.”</p><p>Agatha looked up at her, breath shallow, expression unreadable.</p><p>Then—softly, seriously:</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered. “Yeah. Okay.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched. “Pick one.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched—barely. “You won’t like it.”</p><p>“Try me.”</p><p>A beat.</p><p>Then Agatha whispered, “Mitsubishi.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Are you—”</p><p>Agatha nodded, eyes wide, serious as sin. “Mitsubishi.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “That’s—why is that—”</p><p>“Hard to say mid-orgasm. Makes it count.”</p><p>Rio dropped her head to her shoulder, shaking with laughter. “Mitsubishi,” she muttered. “Unbelievable.”</p><p>“You said I could pick.”</p><p>“You weaponised a <em>car brand.</em>”</p><p>Agatha smiled, smug and breathless.<br/>“Better than saying your name.”</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Just for a second.</p><p>Then pushed up onto her palms, pinning Agatha with a look.</p><p>“Oh,” she said, tone dropping, heat curling into her voice like smoke. “So that’s how we’re playing it. Don’t act like you weren’t just screaming it.”</p><p>Agatha blinked up at her, feigning innocence. “Still casual.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>She just shifted her hips—lining herself up with Agatha’s entrance again—one hand braced beside Agatha’s head, the other slipping down to guide the strap in.</p><p>She pressed in slow this time.</p><p>Agatha gasped—tight and high, thighs twitching around Rio’s hips as she stretched around her again.<br/>Still sensitive.<br/>Still soaked.</p><p>Still so fucking <em>perfect</em>.</p><p>“God,” Agatha hissed, throwing her head back.</p><p>“Nope,” Rio said, her voice barely holding together. “Just me.”</p><p>She sank in all the way—hips flush, chest almost pressed to Agatha’s.</p><p>And when she looked down—</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Eye contact.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were wide and dark, mouth parted, lips kiss-swollen, cheeks flushed pink from heat and friction and <em>everything they were pretending not to feel.</em></p><p>Rio swore under her breath.</p><p>Because suddenly she couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Suddenly her arms were shaking.<br/>Her thighs burned.<br/>The harness was pressing exactly right and if she didn’t pace herself—</p><p>“Are you seriously about to cum already?” Agatha whispered, wicked.</p><p>Rio growled. “Shut up.”</p><p>“Aw. Does eye contact make you emotional?”</p><p>Rio pulled almost all the way out.</p><p>Then slammed back in.</p><p>Agatha <em>moaned.</em></p><p>Loud. Raw. No more teasing—just sound, just wreckage.</p><p>Rio groaned through gritted teeth.<br/>“Keep looking at me.”</p><p>Agatha did.</p><p>And Rio saw everything.</p><p>Want. Need. The stupid aching <em>trust</em> of it.</p><p>She snapped her hips forward again, finding a rhythm that felt like <em>revenge</em> and <em>surrender</em> all at once.</p><p>Agatha met every thrust—legs wrapped tight around Rio’s waist, nails dragging across Rio’s back, voice falling apart.</p><p>“Harder,” she begged. “Right there—don’t stop—fuck—”</p><p>Rio kissed her.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>Mouth crashing into hers like she needed to muffle the sound of her own unravelling.</p><p>Tongues messy. Teeth clashing. Heat surging.</p><p>Still <em>not</em> casual.</p><p>Still <em>so fucking casual</em>.</p><p>And Rio was going to cum.</p><p>She could feel it coiling tight—deep and low, every movement making her hips jerk, her breath stutter.</p><p>She pulled back from the kiss, panting. “Don’t you dare say Mitsubishi.”</p><p>Agatha was laughing and gasping at the same time. “I wasn’t gonna—oh <em>God</em>—”</p><p>Rio dug her fingers into Agatha’s thigh, her other arm bracing herself against Agatha’s head.</p><p>Rio’s rhythm turned sloppy, desperate, <em>real.</em></p><p>She pressed their foreheads together, breath crashing into Agatha’s mouth like a confession she couldn’t say out loud, their eyes locked.<br/>Her hips stuttered. Her thighs trembling with the effort.<br/>The strap dragged deep, harder with every twitch of her body.</p><p>She was close. <em>Too</em> close.</p><p>“You’re gonna make me fucking—fuck, Agatha—”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha gasped, voice wrecked, back arching. “Do it.”<br/>And Rio didn’t need to be told twice.</p><p>It hit her like a brick through glass.<br/>Sudden. Sharp. Total.</p><p>Her whole body <em>snapped,</em> muscles locking, mouth falling open on a guttural groan as the harness pushed right where she needed it—deep, grinding, shaking her apart.</p><p>She didn’t close her eyes. Didn’t look away.</p><p>Couldn’t.</p><p>Because Agatha was staring up at her like she’d been waiting for this—like she needed to see her <em>break</em>.</p><p>And when Rio did—</p><p>Agatha shattered.</p><p>Just <em>watching her.</em></p><p>Her mouth dropped open, her legs locked tight around Rio’s hips and her back arching as she came with a gasp that wasn’t loud—but <em>felt</em> loud.</p><p>Tight. Desperate.<br/>So fast it shocked them both.</p><p>Eyes locked.</p><p>Breath tangled.</p><p>Rio still moving—small thrusts, almost unintentional, grinding through the mess of it, through both of them shaking.</p><p>Agatha moaned—high and sharp, and Rio could <em>feel</em> the way her body clenched again, aftershocks catching her off-guard.</p><p>Still—neither of them looked away.<br/>Agatha’s mouth trembled.<br/>Rio’s forehead pressed to hers, their breaths mingling—hot and uneven.<br/>Sweat clung between them. Skin flushed.<br/>Bodies shaking.<br/>Still joined. Still inside her.</p><p>For one second.<br/>Two.<br/>Three.</p><p>Then Agatha whispered, hoarse—<br/>“That… was not very casual.”</p><p>Rio let out a laugh that cracked apart halfway through—breathy, stunned, scraped raw from somewhere too deep to name.<br/>Too much.<br/>Too late.</p><p>She didn’t answer.<br/>Just leaned in and kissed her.</p><p>Mouth to mouth, humid and shaking.<br/>Lips parted, slow at first—seeking, tasting.<br/>Agatha gasped softly as Rio’s tongue slid against hers, and the sound melted into Rio’s mouth, swallowed whole.</p><p>One of Agatha’s hands found her neck—fingers curling tight, like she didn’t trust the world to hold her steady.<br/>The other gripped her waist, dragging her closer even though they were already flush, hips pressed tight, strap still buried deep.</p><p>The kiss deepened.<br/>Messy and open, their lips sliding together, soft sounds catching at the edges—little gasps, stifled moans, the occasional broken hum like neither of them knew what the hell they were doing anymore.</p><p>Rio’s head spun.<br/>Her pulse thudded between her legs.<br/>Agatha was still trembling beneath her—hips twitching, chest rising to meet every breath they shared.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, mouths slick, panting, foreheads touching again—<br/>Neither of them moved.<br/>Neither of them spoke.</p><p>They just held on.</p><p>Still connected.<br/>Still pretending.<br/>Still not fooling anyone.</p>

<strong>Agatha's POV</strong>
</p><p>There was a knock at the door.<br/>Not loud or panicked. Just... ominous. Like the universe itself was clearing its throat.</p><p>Agatha groaned from the depths of the sheets, dragging the pillow over her head. Everything ached—in the good way. Her thighs, her back, the soft hinge of her jaw. She was sweaty. Sticky. Still naked. And vaguely aware that the strap-on had migrated to somewhere beneath her calf.</p><p>The bed shifted beside her as Rio rolled out with a soft grunt.</p><p>“Time is it?” she muttered, scratching at her stomach.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She just curled into the warm spot Rio left behind and hoped the universe would knock later.</p><p>Another knock. Firmer now. Confident. Knowing.</p><p>Agatha blinked into the pillow.</p><p>“Is that… the devil?” she croaked.</p><p>Rio was already halfway to the hallway, hoodie half-zipped, no pants, hair sticking up like a warning sign. She paused by the door. Squinted through the peephole.</p><p>Then groaned. “Shit.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It's your coworker… Lilia?” It was whisper yelled across the apartment.</p><p>Agatha sat bolt upright, sheets tangling around her waist. “What?”</p><p>“She is smiling weird,” Rio added.</p><p>Agatha shoved her hands through her hair and hissed, “Don’t open it.”</p><p>Rio opened it.</p><p>“Hi,” she said flatly.</p><p>Lilia stood in the hallway like she had conjured herself there. Long colourful coat, perfect posture, eyes gleaming with secrets and the subtle satisfaction of being right.</p><p>“Morning,” she said, breezily. “Or, well, <em>almost</em> noon.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hear Rio respond.</p><p>“I was wondering if you’d seen Agatha,” Lilia continued, peering past her like she already knew exactly where Agatha was. “She hasn’t come in to work for two days, hasn’t answered her phone, and we all know she doesn’t <em>do</em> unannounced disappearances unless she’s either very sick or very, very gay.”</p><p>Rio choked.</p><p>Agatha appeared behind her just in time for that last part—wearing only Rio’s shirt, barely reaching her mid thighs, hair an utter catastrophe, and one sock.</p><p>“I’m not sick,” she muttered. “Just… indisposed.”</p><p>Lilia’s brows rose like a curtain.</p><p>“Mhm,” she said, eyes flicking over the state of them both. “You know, if you’d just let me cast a love rune on your fridge like I <em>offered</em>, we could’ve avoided all this shadow-dancing around your feelings.”</p><p>Agatha groaned into her hand. “Lilia, <em>please.”</em></p><p>“I’m just saying,” she added, folding her arms. “It’s only <em>mildly</em> unethical to interfere in a will-they-won’t-they if you’re certain it’s going to end in mutual pining and poor communication.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Are you… quoting your own tarot reading right now?”</p><p>Lilia smiled. “Who can say?”</p><p>Agatha made a strangled noise in her throat. “I swear to God, if you tell HR I’ve been kidnapped by my sex life—”</p><p>“Oh, I’ll tell them you’ve been <em>claimed by destiny</em>, darling,” Lilia said, already turning to go. “You’re safe for now. But if you disappear for a third day? I’m staging an intervention. Possibly with sage.”</p><p>She paused, glanced back at Rio with a wink. “Good morning, Rio.”</p><p>“...Uh.”</p><p>Then she was gone, coat trailing behind her like a curtain call.</p><p>The door clicked shut.</p><p>Agatha stared at it like it might reverse time if she glared hard enough.</p><p>Rio was still looking at the wood, head tilted, like she'd just received a divine prophecy delivered entirely through sarcasm and smugness.</p><p>“I hate you,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“Mm.” Rio didn’t look back. Just grnned. That infuriating gap-toothed smile full of bite and mischief. “You said that last night too.”</p><p>“Because it’s still true.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed both hands down her face, like she could erase the past five minutes with friction alone. Her skin was hot. Her ears were still ringing. She could <em>still feel</em> the way Lilia had looked at her, like she was ten steps ahead on a chessboard Agatha didn’t even know they were playing.</p><p>She let her hands fall and—</p><p>Rio was closer.</p><p>Arms crossed, hip cocked against the hallway wall, looking like she’d invented sin and got royalties every time someone broke a commandment. The sunlight caught on her cheekbone, on the hollow of her throat. The hoodie hung off her shoulder like it couldn’t bear to cling properly.</p><p>And her expression?</p><p>Smug. Dangerous. <em>Amused</em>.</p><p>“Wanna shower?” Rio asked casually, like she wasn’t a walking felony.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “What?”</p><p>“You look like you’re still trying to astral project out of your body.”</p><p>“Because I am.”</p><p>Rio grinned wider. “Well, consider this a grounding exercise. I have water. Soap. A very impressive detachable showerhead.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Is that supposed to be a seduction tactic?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said, already turning on her heel. “But if it works, I’m not gonna fight it.”</p><p>Agatha watched her go.</p><p>Watched her disappear around the corner with that stupid sway to her hips, like she <em>knew</em> Agatha was watching.</p><p>For one wild moment, Agatha considered running. Just sprinting back to her apartment. Maybe out of the building entirely. She could fake her death. Move to Canada. Start a podcast.</p><p>Instead, she sighed. Loud. Dramatic. Full body.</p><p>And followed.</p><p>The bathroom was already humid when she stepped inside, steam curling from the narrow window like the room had a pulse. Sunlight filtered through it in hazy beams, staining everything gold. The tiles, the walls, her skin. It felt like stepping into someone else’s dream.</p><p>Rio was standing at the sink. Naked. Brushing her teeth. Her back to her. Legs slightly apart. Head tilted to one side as she spat toothpaste into the basin.</p><p>Casual. Like they hadn’t just broken a rule in the first 12 hours of their casual agreement.<em> No sleepovers. </em></p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything. Didn’t trust her voice not to betray her.</p><p>Her mouth was dry. Her body ached in places she didn’t even know could ache. A low, delicious kind of ache. The kind that reminded you exactly who had touched you, and how.</p><p>She peeled Rio’s shirt off her own skin, undies and single sock following in a lazy trail to the floor and stepped into the shower.</p><p>The water was hot. Too hot. It stung her shoulders, slapped the back of her neck, dragged across her chest—but she didn’t adjust it.</p><p>She needed the burn. Needed something to drag her out of her head, where Lilia’s knowing smirk and Rio’s stupid, smug mouth were doing laps around her brain.</p><p>She tilted her head back, let the spray catch her lashes, and tried not to think about what she looked like stumbling out of Rio’s room, post-orgasm, still half asleep and half barefoot, into the view of a woman who had always seen right through her.</p><p>Tried not to think about Rio either—standing just a metre away, naked, bent over the basin, all spine and hips and the casual arrogance of someone who knew exactly what she’d done to you.</p><p>That was the worst part.</p><p>Rio <em>knew</em>.</p><p>She always had that look in her eye—like she’d figured Agatha out months ago and was just waiting for her to catch up.</p><p>“Need anything?” came a voice, too close.</p><p>Agatha opened one eye.</p><p>Rio was leaning against the glass frame, not fully inside. Just… there. Arms loose at her sides. Hair messy and curling around her collarbone. Mouth pink and swollen.</p><p>Trouble, in the flesh.</p><p>“Privacy?” Agatha said, deadpan.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio replied. “Fresh out.”</p><p>“Rio—”</p><p>But her eyes had already dropped.</p><p>Tracked the curve of Agatha’s spine. The way water slid down her shoulder blades. The subtle movement of her legs as she adjusted to the spray. And even though Rio didn’t say a word—Agatha could feel the shift.</p><p>That subtle hum beneath her skin.</p><p>A glance. A flicker. That quiet kind of hunger that needed no prelude. The look that said <em>again</em>. That said <em>please</em>. That said <em>you ruin me, and I’ll let you do it twice</em>.</p><p>“You look clean enough,” Rio murmured.</p><p>And then she stepped in behind Agatha.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>No ceremony. No smirk. No teasing.</p><p>Only the soft slide of the door behind her, the curtain of steam wrapping around them both like a trap.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Didn’t speak.</p><p>This was fine.</p><p>
<em>Totally fine.</em>
</p><p>She told herself not to flinch. Not to overthink it. Just stand still and let Rio get it out of her system.</p><p>Because that’s all this was meant to be, right?</p><p>A system. A pattern. A routine.</p><p>They had rules.</p><p>No sleepovers. <em>Which was already broken, but we don’t need to think about that.</em></p><p>No kissing unless they were already halfway gone.</p><p>No talking about what any of it meant.</p><p><em>This doesn’t mean anything,</em> she reminded herself.</p><p>Rio didn’t touch her right away.</p><p>Just stood behind her. Watching.</p><p>Close enough that Agatha could feel her breath on her shoulder, hear the faint catch in her throat. Her body was radiant—hot skin, damp hair, that familiar scent now made humid and heavy.</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek.</p><p>Don’t think.</p><p>Don’t name it.</p><p>Don’t let it settle in your chest where it might bloom into something you can’t cut out later.</p><p>Rio leaned in and kissed her shoulder. Slow. Soft. Once, then twice.</p><p>Her hands came next—curling around her waist, her ribs, almost reverent.</p><p>And that was the problem.</p><p>It wasn’t rough.</p><p>It wasn’t rushed.</p><p>It was <em>tender</em>.</p><p><em>Don’t do this,</em> Agatha thought, stomach flipping.</p><p>But she turned in Rio’s arms anyway.</p><p>Caught her mouth with hers.</p><p>Because her body was faster than her fear.</p><p>The kiss was open-mouthed and wet and <em>wrong</em>. Because it felt like something it wasn’t supposed to. Because it felt like a question. Like Rio was asking <em>Is this okay? Are we okay?</em></p><p>And Agatha kissed her back like she didn’t want to know the answer.</p><p>Steam curling around them, plastering Rio’s damp hair to her face. Agatha gripped the back of her neck. Pulled her closer. Closer still. Until there wasn’t an inch of space between them.</p><p><em>This is just a game,</em> she told herself.</p><p>Her hands found Rio’s waist.</p><p>Rio’s hands slipped lower.</p><p>Agatha gasped as fingers slid between her thighs between their bodies. Her hips jerked forward, her lips separating from Rio’s.</p><p>The sound that came out of her mouth was too close to a sob.</p><p>
<em>It’s just sex. It’s only sex. It’s fine.</em>
</p><p>She gritted her teeth. Tried to breathe.</p><p>But Rio’s touch was confident. Familiar. <em>Loving.</em></p><p>
<em>No. Not that.</em>
</p><p>She couldn’t do this again. Not like this. Not when it felt like Rio knew her. Not when it felt like Rio <em>wanted</em> her—not just her body, but all the mess behind it.</p><p>This wasn’t casual.</p><p>This was her unravelling.</p><p>And so she moved.</p><p>Grabbed Rio’s wrist. Pulled her hand away—not harshly, but firmly.</p><p>Rio blinked, startled. Mouth parted. Eyes wide.</p><p>Agatha didn’t explain.</p><p>Couldn’t.</p><p>Because if she said it out loud—if she admitted how much it was starting to hurt <em>already</em>—she might never stop.</p><p>So instead, she turned her.</p><p>Pressed her into the glass, breath shaky, heart pounding, <em>controlling it again</em>. She needed control.</p><p>“Don’t move,” she muttered. Her voice was hoarse. Barely hers.</p><p>
<em>This is fine.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This is casual.</em>
</p><p>She slid her hand down Rio’s spine, slow and deliberate. Bit the side of her neck—not hard, but enough to make Rio moan and arch back into her.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers found her wet.</p><p>Already.</p><p>Soaked.</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>“Fuck,” she whispered, not sure if it was praise or punishment.</p><p>And then—she pushed two fingers inside.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>The breath Rio let out fogged the glass in front of her. Her hands braced against it, her knees bending slightly as her whole body tensed.</p><p>Agatha didn’t let up.</p><p>Didn’t soften.</p><p>She curled her fingers, drove them deeper. Her other arm wrapped around Rio’s waist, pinning her in place. Containing her. Containing <em>herself</em>.</p><p>“You like this?” Agatha said low against her ear, trying to stay sharp. “Getting fucked without feeling?”</p><p>Rio groaned.</p><p>Her answer didn’t come in words.</p><p>Just the sound of her hips rocking back. Her body asking for more.</p><p>Agatha gave it.</p><p>Gave everything.</p><p>Because if she made Rio come like this—if she reduced her to nothing but need—then maybe <em>this</em> would mean nothing too.</p><p>Maybe she could rewrite the truth.</p><p>Not love. Not longing. Not the aching, terrifying weight of <em>I think I care about you.</em></p><p>Just <em>this.</em></p><p>Just the sound of Rio coming apart under her hand.</p><p>And when it happened—</p><p>When Rio’s whole body trembled and she came with a shuddering gasp—</p><p>Agatha held her tight.</p><p>Buried her face in her shoulder.</p><p>The water kept running. Their breath filled the space between them like mist, fragile and impossible to hold. Agatha didn’t move. Didn’t let go.</p><p>But Rio did.</p><p>She shifted—slow, liquid, like her bones had melted—and turned in Agatha’s arms.</p><p>Still panting. Still slick with steam.</p><p>She didn’t say anything.</p><p>Just grabbed her neck and leaned in, kissing her again.</p><p>Not hungry or desperate.</p><p>Just... close.</p><p>Soft lips, lingering pressure. Like she wanted to press the shape of her mouth into Agatha’s memory.</p><p>And Agatha almost let her.</p><p>Almost drowned in it again.</p><p>But she pulled back. Slowly. Reluctantly.</p><p>And didn’t quite meet her eyes.</p><p>“I should go,” she said quietly.</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>The water hit her back, gliding down her spine. She blinked at Agatha, lashes clumped from steam and sweat and something dangerously close to hope.</p><p>“Go?” she echoed.</p><p>Agatha reached for the tap. Turned it off. Listened to the last drops patter down the drain like an ending.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said, a little too brisk. A little too bright. “I have errands. Chores. Laundry. You know. <em>Life</em>.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head.</p><p>Agatha stepped out of the shower and grabbed a towel without looking.</p><p>“And I work tomorrow,” she added, voice muffled as she rubbed it over her face. “Which means I need clothes. And a shower that doesn’t end in—you know<em>. This</em>.”</p><p>She gestured vaguely at the fogged-up glass. The wrinkled fingers. The faint echo of her own moan still lodged in her throat.</p><p>Rio didn’t laugh.</p><p>Didn’t tease.</p><p>She just watched her.</p><p>And Agatha could feel it—that tiny, invisible string pulling between them. That tug of <em>don’t go</em> that neither of them said out loud.</p><p>Because they couldn’t.</p><p>Because that would make it real.</p><p>So Rio nodded.</p><p>Stepped out.</p><p>Grabbed a towel. Dried her hair like it wasn’t falling into her eyes just to give her something to do.</p><p>Agatha lingered. Wet, flushed, unsteady on her feet—and only now realising she didn’t have a single stitch of clothing of her own.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>She wrapped herself in the towel. Tucked the corner in tight. Stood there dripping on the tile like the ghost of a bad decision. Then looked around like a burglar casing a room she’d already been caught in.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked, voice muffled as she scrubbed her towel over her head.</p><p>“I don’t have clothes,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Rio peeked out from under the towel. One eyebrow raised. “You had a <em>towel</em>. Which is still in a heap by my bed.”</p><p>Agatha glared.</p><p>Rio smirked.</p><p>“Drawer’s open,” she said, gesturing toward her bedroom. “Help yourself.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. Mumbled something like, “You’re lucky I’m too tired to be proud,” and padded barefoot across the apartment to Rio’s bedroom.</p><p>She pulled open the drawer.</p><p>Stopped.</p><p>Because of course it was filled with tank tops. And boxer briefs. And one truly unhinged hoodie that said <em>SORRY I’M LATE I DIDN’T WANT TO COME</em>.</p><p>She grabbed the hoodie. Sniffed it. It smelled like Rio. Bad idea.</p><p>She took it anyway.</p><p>Boxers too. Because the alternative was going commando and she wasn’t about to risk that with Rio lurking in the hallway.</p><p>By the time she emerged from the bedroom, she was dressed in a hoodie that fell to mid-thigh and boxer briefs that barely covered anything.</p><p>Rio looked up. Paused. And blinked very, very slowly.</p><p>“Those are mine,” she said, which was technically true but felt entirely unhelpful.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “You said I could help myself.”</p><p>“Yeah, I just didn’t expect you to look better in them than I do.”</p><p>“Don’t be weird.”</p><p>Rio’s grin was infuriating. And hot. And infuriating.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. Tucked her towel from the night before under her arm like a battle flag.</p><p>“I’ll wash them and bring them back,” she muttered.</p><p>“You won’t.”</p><p>“I might.”</p><p>“You won’t,” Rio said again, softer this time. But not teasing. Not really.</p><p>Agatha paused in the doorway. Something in her chest went tight.</p><p>She adjusted the towel under her arm. Didn’t look back.</p><p>“I’ll see you,” she said.</p><p>Rio followed and leaned against the doorframe.</p><p>“Knock twice,” she said, and it almost sounded like a question.</p><p>“Right,” Agatha whispered, her eyes flicking to meet Rio’s briefly, “Twice.”</p><p>Then she stepped into the hallway, hoodie sleeves too long, her damp towel still under one arm like a ridiculous, soggy souvenir.</p><p>She didn’t say goodbye.</p><p>Didn’t turn around again.</p><p>Just walked back to her apartment barefoot, pretending her legs weren’t sore, pretending she didn’t want to stay, pretending she wasn’t biting the inside of her cheek just to keep from turning around and kissing her like it would mean something.</p><p>She let herself in.</p><p>Closed her door softly behind her.</p><p>And leaned back against it for a second eyes closed, heartbeat embarrassingly loud in her ears.</p><p><em>Just a hookup,</em> she told herself.</p><p>
<em>Nothing serious.</em>
</p><p>Then she looked down at Rio’s hoodie still hanging on her like it didn’t know it wasn’t supposed to fit this well.</p><p>And let out a very, very quiet “fuck.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Thirteen days.</p><p>That’s how long it had been.</p><p>Thirteen days of knocking twice. Of whispered jokes at midnight. Of sweat-slicked skin and no eye contact the morning after. Of rules they didn’t follow. Of lies they told with their hands and truths they buried under moans and teeth and touch.</p><p>And now?</p><p>Now they were tangled in her bed—again.</p><p>The sun was setting outside, painting the room in soft gold, and Rio’s arm was draped over her like it belonged there. Her breath tickled Agatha’s collarbone. She smelled like sex.</p><p>Agatha stared at the ceiling and tried to ignore the ache behind her ribs.<br/>
Flashbacks kept flying through her head. They always did, these days. They never let her rest. Not fully.</p><p>Even when her body was wrecked and wrung out—skin still tingling, thighs sore, jaw aching from where Rio had gripped it, made her moan around her fingers. Her mind just refused to shut off.</p><p>Because it wasn’t just sex.<br/>
Or maybe it was.<br/>
But it was also this—this after. This silence that buzzed like a bruise under her skin.</p><p>She closed her eyes. Let her mind wander. It always found the same loops.</p><p>-</p><p>
<em>It had been too late to cook. They both knew it. But they were starving—because they’d spent the last few hours fucking like sleep was optional, like water and food were optional, like the only thing their bodies knew how to crave anymore was each other. Every attempt to clean up or find clothes or breathe had turned into another kiss, another groan, another round on the nearest surface.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha had finally made it to the kitchen, phone in hand, scrolling lazily. Loose-limbed. Still damp from the shower. A thin tank clinging to her skin. No bra. Just underwear and the echo of Rio’s mouth on her thighs.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She wasn’t trying to look inviting.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But then Rio walked in with her hood down, hair wet, strap already back on like she'd never taken it off. Eyes blown wide, jaw tight, chest rising like she’d run here straight from the bedroom. And maybe she had.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha clocked the look. That twitch in Rio’s fingers. That low-slung hunger like she'd forgotten how to wait.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha didn’t move. Just raised an eyebrow. “We said food.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“We say a lot of things,” Rio replied.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha gave a half-hearted scoff, glancing back at her phone. “We’ve already... like, three times.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Four,” Rio corrected. Then took a step closer. “Bend.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha sighed. Poorly. Weak. The kind of protest you made when you already knew you’d give in. “We’re gonna die of dehydration.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Then die pretty.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>And Agatha bent.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Tank shoved up. Tits flat to cold granite. The slap of hips and heat and something deeper curling between her legs before Rio even touched her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She didn’t tease. Didn’t draw it out.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just shoved in—slow and full and deliberate—like every inch was a promise.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha gasped, her breath fogging the marble. Her knees buckled. One of Rio’s hands held her down, the other gripped her hip with the kind of pressure that said mine without ever saying it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And then she started moving.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Not soft. Not loving.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just a brutal rhythm. Claiming. Intentional. The kind of fucking that made Agatha forget her name and remember only how good this felt. How right this felt. How dangerous it was that it felt that way.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her moan came out cracked and filthy, swallowed by the countertop.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She didn’t care.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Not about the hour. Not about the neighbours. Not about anything except Rio.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her thoughts shattered.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This is better than every man I’ve ever been with. Put together.<br/>
By miles.<br/>
By fucking galaxies.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She clenched her jaw. Eyes shut tight.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t say that. Don’t you dare say that out loud.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She didn’t.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But she thought it again the next night.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And the night after that.</em>
</p><p>
<em>-</em>
</p><p>Or when they had run into each other coming home.</p><p>-</p><p>
<em>In work clothes. Both tired. Agatha had been holding groceries. Rio had earbuds in and a muscle in her jaw that only popped when she was stressed.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The elevator doors closed.</em>
</p><p>
<em>They didn’t speak. Just stood there, side by side.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And then Rio had looked at her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Something electric passed between them—stupid, cliché. Agatha felt it in her teeth. Her fingertips.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Then Rio pushed the emergency stop.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No words. No warning.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just her hand yanking Agatha by the waist, their mouths colliding, hands already unbuttoning—teeth clashing, breathing heavy. Agatha’s skirt shoved up, panties to the side.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was fast. Frantic.</em>
</p><p>
<em>One of Rio’s hands on her throat, the other inside her. Fingers slick and curling just right. Agatha’s back against the mirrored wall, legs shaking.</em>
</p><p>
<em>When she came, it was like a scream trapped in her chest.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And afterward?</em>
</p><p>
<em>They rode the rest of the way in silence.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Neither of them mentioned it again.</em>
</p><p>
<em>-</em>
</p><p>But then there were moments where it started to feel real. Started to make Agatha slightly hopeful.</p><p>They didn’t kiss outside of sex.</p><p>That was one of their rules. One of the few they hadn’t already shattered.</p><p>
<em>-</em>
</p><p>
<em>But one morning, Agatha had woken up first. She’d turned over carefully, just to look at her. Just to see her—sleep-tousled hair, bare shoulder, mouth slightly open against the pillow.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And Rio had opened her eyes.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just looked at her. Quiet. Unblinking. No teasing.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha hadn’t known what to do with that much softness. She was used to the fire, the chaos, the sweat. But this? This stillness?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio had reached up. Touched her cheek.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No words.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just a brush of fingers.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Then she’d leaned in. Their mouths barely touched—just the shape of a kiss, the idea of it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha whispered, “Don’t.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>And Rio had stilled. Pulled back.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Didn’t ask why.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But Agatha had seen the flicker in her eyes—the hurt she didn’t want to show.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She hadn’t been able to look at her for the rest of the day.</em>
</p><p>
<em>-</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s thighs clenched under the blanket.</p><p>She should feel satisfied. Sated.<br/>
But instead, she felt split open.</p><p>She didn’t mean to think about them like this.<br/>
Didn’t mean to relive it.<br/>
But her brain wouldn’t stop.</p><p>Wouldn’t even stop at what happened an hour ago.</p><p>The way Agatha rode Rio’s fingers. The rhythm was brutal. Grounded. Every motion precise and angry and real.</p><p>And then Rio started talking.</p><p>Started <em>saying things.</em></p><p>
<em>“You feel so good like this—fuck—like you were made for me—”</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s hand had snapped up, wrapped tight around her throat before the next word could land.</p><p>Rio gasped, hips jerking underneath her.</p><p>Agatha’s other hand braced against Rio’s ribs. She fucked herself on her fingers like she was trying to outrun the honesty pouring out of Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“Shut up,” she hissed, but there was no heat behind it. Only panic.</p><p>Only <em>want.</em></p><p>Rio’s mouth stayed open—but no more words came.</p><p>Just breath.</p><p>Just broken, shallow gasps as Agatha kept going, tightening her grip every time Rio’s voice hitched like she might try to say something else.</p><p>It had started happening more often lately, that move.</p><p>Agatha knew the pattern. Knew the way Rio started talking when she felt <em>too much.</em> When her hands weren’t enough to say it. When her lips tried to do what Agatha was too afraid to.</p><p>So Agatha choked her.</p><p>Never hard enough to hurt.</p><p>Just enough to feel in control again.</p><p>Agatha never wanted to hear those things.<br/>
But her body betrayed her every time.</p><p>Especially when Rio looked up at her like that.<br/>
Eyes glossy. Lips parted. Like she loved the way Agatha shook when she broke.</p><p>And now here she was.<br/>
Lying in bed.</p><p>Still shaking.</p><p>Still aching.</p><p>Still pretending this was normal.</p><p>That this wasn’t eating her alive from the inside out.</p><p>But it wasn’t normal.<br/>
It never had been.<br/>
And the thought slammed into her before she could stop it:</p><p>
<em>Why can’t this be real?</em>
</p><p>Her brain supplied every answer like it had been preparing the defense all week.</p><p>
<em>Because you’re too old for her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because she’ll wake up one day and wonder what the fuck she’s doing with a woman who’s been divorced, who has a skincare drawer almost older than her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because you’ve barely even told her about your past. Because your past is too heavy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because she’s supposed to be a phase.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because if it ends, it’ll break you.</em>
</p><p>Rio shifted beside her, breath warm against Agatha’s neck like punctuation to thoughts she hadn’t dared speak aloud. Her hand flexed once—faint, instinctive—against Agatha’s stomach, then stilled. Like even in sleep, she wanted to hold on.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move at first.</p><p>Then, slowly, she turned onto her side—away from the heat, away from the weight of that hand—and let her own arm fall uselessly across the sheets. Cold air hit her skin, but it was nothing compared to the guilt bubbling up, thick and acidic. It stuck in her throat like bile.</p><p>She didn’t want to say it.</p><p>Didn’t want to break the moment.</p><p>But it was already breaking. Already slipping through her fingers, thread by trembling thread.</p><p>Rio’s voice came soft. Barely awake. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha almost said yes. The word hovered on her tongue, flimsy and false, waiting to be swallowed.</p><p>But it tasted wrong.</p><p>Bitter. Thin. Useless.</p><p>Because she wasn’t okay.</p><p>She was unravelling. Every exhale against her shoulder, every heartbeat that didn’t belong to her, every warm, quiet second was another crack in the armour she’d been pretending still fit.</p><p>And the truth escaped before she could smother it.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said—sharper than she meant to. “I’m not. This—this isn’t working.”</p><p>The shift was immediate. Palpable. Like all the air had been sucked out of the room and replaced with ice.</p><p>Rio pushed up behind her, the mattress dipping under her weight. “What?”</p><p>Agatha’s spine went rigid. Her words hung in the silence like a blade. And everything else—the warmth, the comfort, the illusion—cracked around it.</p><p>She didn’t turn around.</p><p>She couldn’t.</p><p>Because if she looked at Rio—if she saw her eyes, her mouth, the confusion starting to bloom there—she might choke on the truth instead.</p><p>Rio sat up, the sheet pulling with her, tugging at Agatha’s bare back like a reminder. “What do you mean it’s not working?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, steady and tight. “Exactly what it sounds like.”</p><p>She heard Rio shift again, felt the weight of her stare like a spotlight on her shoulder blades.</p><p>“You waited until now?” Her voice was soft. Not angry yet. Just wounded. Disbelieving. “You waited until after—”</p><p>And then it landed.</p><p>“After we fucked?” Rio barked a laugh, bitter and broken. “Are you fucking kidding me?”</p><p>Agatha flinched.</p><p>“I—” She tried, but the words stuck. “It’s not a good idea. Okay? This whole thing was never—” Her throat closed. “It was never going to last.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, flat. Acidic. “Now you’re worried about longevity?”</p><p>“I’m being realistic.”</p><p>“No, you’re being a coward.”</p><p>Agatha turned, finally. Just slightly. “It’s not sustainable.”</p><p>Rio’s lip curled, incredulous. “What the hell are you talking about? You sound like you’re ending a lease, not a—” She stopped herself. Bit the word back.</p><p>But Agatha could hear it. The weight of it. <em>Relationship.</em></p><p>Rio shook her head. “You’re not pitching a fucking startup, Agatha. You’re talking about us.”</p><p>“There is no us,” Agatha snapped, too fast. Too loud. The words scraped her throat on the way out.</p><p>And that—<em>that</em>—was the moment she knew she’d gone too far.</p><p>She heard Rio suck in a sharp breath behind her, like she’d just been punched in the chest.</p><p>“Right,” Rio said, quiet now. Hollow. “Right. Of course there isn’t.”</p><p>Agatha shut her eyes.</p><p>She hadn’t meant it like that. Not exactly. But fear had a way of twisting her mouth into weapons.</p><p>How was she supposed to explain the panic clawing at her ribs? The way every second with Rio felt like standing too close to something she couldn’t keep?</p><p>She didn’t want to lose her.</p><p>So she pushed her away.</p><p>Because it was safer to detonate the bomb herself than wait for it to blow.</p><p>Because she was terrified.</p><p>She hadn’t been in a real relationship since her divorce.</p><p>Not really.</p><p>She’d dated, sure—kept things light, controlled, forgettable. She didn’t let people close. Didn’t let them see her tired. Unguarded. Soft. She hadn’t wanted to give anyone the opportunity to leave her when they saw the mess she really was underneath the mascara and sarcasm.</p><p>And now here was this woman—this <em>girl</em>—ten years younger, all sharp teeth and stupid tenderness, a chaos engine in boots with a crooked smile and a heart too big for her own good.</p><p>Agatha had <em>never</em> felt this much. Not even close.</p><p>And it was too much.</p><p>God, it was too much.</p><p>Because what if Rio figured it out? What if she woke up one day and realized Agatha wasn’t worth the mess?</p><p>What if she looked at her—<em>really</em> looked—and saw all the lines around her eyes, all the baggage she carried in silence, all the cracks that never quite healed right?</p><p>What if she wanted someone newer?</p><p>Someone easier?</p><p>Someone who didn’t freeze every time things got too soft?</p><p>Someone who wasn’t this scared?</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. Her eyes burned.</p><p>“I just…” She swallowed. “I need space.”</p><p>Rio blinked. Her voice rose, tight and raw. “You’ve <em>had</em> space. You built a fucking fortress out of it.”</p><p>Agatha sat up, snapping around to face her. “Well, maybe I like it in here.”</p><p>Rio laughed, but there was no humor in it. “Yeah. I can tell.”</p><p>“I’m <em>sorry</em>,” Agatha bit out. “I’m sorry if I don’t want to get dragged into something that’s bound to crash and burn.”</p><p>“Wow.” Rio stared at her like she’d never seen her before. “You really think that little of us?”</p><p>“I think I’m being realistic.”</p><p>“Realistic?” Rio repeated, like it tasted like poison in her mouth.</p><p>Agatha gestured, her voice sharp and shaking. “You’re twenty-seven, Rio.”</p><p>“And?” Her tone was defiant, but her hands were clenched at her sides.</p><p>“And I’m <em>not.</em> I’m not young, I’m not spontaneous, I’m not whatever the hell you think you want right now. I’m tired. I’m complicated. I come with warning labels.”</p><p>“This—” Agatha waved vaguely between them. “This was fun. But it was always going to implode.”</p><p>Rio’s expression cracked—something small and quiet behind her eyes shattering open. “You think I don’t <em>know</em> who you are?” Her voice trembled, just barely. “You think I haven’t seen all your messy, scared, infuriating parts? You think I didn’t <em>choose</em> you anyway?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. Her eyes dropped. She couldn’t hold Rio’s gaze. Couldn’t stand to see what she’d just done to it.</p><p>She didn’t answer.</p><p>Because what could she say?</p><p>She was terrified.</p><p>And terror had always made her mean.</p><p>Rio pressed a hand to her chest like she was holding herself together. Like if she didn’t, something inside her might spill out—messy and permanent.</p><p>“I never wanted casual,” she said, voice low. Flat.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed. “It was my idea, sure. <em>Because I didn’t know how else you’d let me have you.</em>”</p><p>That landed like a punch to the ribs.</p><p>“I thought if I gave you space—rules—you’d feel safer. You’d stay. I thought maybe if I waited long enough, you’d stop pretending this didn’t matter.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t speak. Couldn’t move. Could only sit there, spine rigid, heart kicking against her ribs like it was trying to escape.</p><p>“I’ve been trying,” Rio went on, eyes shining. “To meet you where you are. To make this work on your terms. But every time I think we’re getting somewhere, you run.”</p><p>“I’m not—” Agatha tried, but the words collapsed in her throat.</p><p>“Yes, you are.” Rio’s voice was sharp now. “You push me out. You <em>shut me out.</em> And I keep telling myself it’s okay, that you just need time, but—fuck, Agatha, I’m tired of talking to a locked door.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands. “I’m sorry,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio laughed bitterly. “You’re not. You’re <em>scared.</em> And instead of saying that, you just light a match and act surprised when it burns.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond.</p><p>Because she couldn’t deny it.</p><p>Rio stood suddenly, the air shifting. She dragged her shirt on like armour, her movements tight and fast. Like if she stayed still too long, she might break.</p><p>“You don’t get to play the victim in this,” she said, voice low and shaking. “<em>I</em> made the rules, yeah—but only because I didn’t think you’d stay without them.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean for it to get messy,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio looked at her then—really looked at her, and the crack in her expression was almost too much to bear. “It was <em>always</em> messy. You just didn’t want to admit it.”</p><p>Silence thickened between them.</p><p>Agatha stared at the floor, nails digging into her thighs. She couldn’t look up. Couldn’t risk seeing how much damage she’d done.</p><p>“I should go,” Rio murmured.</p><p>She stepped toward the door. Each movement soft, slow. Like she was waiting for something.</p><p>A word. A reason to stay.</p><p>Agatha stayed quiet.</p><p>But Rio didn’t leave.</p><p>She exhaled—sharp, frustrated. Her hand clenched at her side.<br/>
“You know what pisses me off the most?” she said, turning back. “It’s not that you’re ending it. It’s that you’re pretending it never mattered.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw locked.<br/>
“I never said that.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said, voice cracking. “But you’re acting like it. Like none of it meant anything. Like <em>I</em> didn’t.”</p><p>“That’s not—” Agatha stood, too fast, regretting it instantly. Now they were eye to eye. Close enough to hurt each other properly.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were glassy with fury she hadn’t bothered to swallow. “You think you’re being noble? Responsible? Fine. Good for you. But I <em>wanted</em> this. <em>You</em>. Even when you made it impossible. Even when you gave me nothing.”</p><p>“You don’t understand,” Agatha said, voice thinner than she meant.</p><p>“I understand <em>perfectly</em>,” Rio snapped. “You keep throwing my age in my face like it’s some kind of trap I walked into blind. Like I didn’t know what I was doing.” She stepped forward. “I <em>chose</em> you. Not because it was easy. Because it <em>wasn’t</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat burned.</p><p>“You think this was casual?” Rio’s laugh was hollow. “You think I kept showing up, kept letting you shut me out, kept trying, just for the sex?”</p><p>Agatha flinched.</p><p>Rio’s voice dropped to something raw, something almost broken. “I want you, Agatha. Not just in your bed. In your life. For real. And I’m so fucking tired of pretending I don’t.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Agatha’s lip trembled. She looked down. “I don’t know how to do this.”</p><p>Rio didn’t back away. “Then say that. Be fucking <em>honest</em>. Say you’re scared. Say you’re overwhelmed. But don’t rewrite what we had just because it hurts.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened. Nothing came out.</p><p>Rio shook her head once. Then:<br/>
“You want me to leave?” Her voice barely held. “Say it. Look at me and say it meant nothing. That I meant nothing. And I swear, I’ll walk out that door and never come back.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.<br/>
Her mouth opened—but nothing came out.</p><p>She looked at Rio. Really looked.<br/>
Hair a mess. Eyes glassy. Shoulders squared like she was trying to hold her own heart in place.</p><p>Say it.<br/>
Say it meant nothing.<br/>
Say it and be done with it.</p><p>Her jaw tightened. Her throat worked around the words. But they wouldn’t form.</p><p>Because they weren’t true.</p><p>And even if she wanted to lie—wanted to protect herself the way she always did—something in Rio’s face made it impossible.</p><p>“I can’t,” Agatha whispered, voice cracking.</p><p>Her body stilled in that awful, brittle way—like glass under pressure. One wrong breath and she’d crack down the middle.</p><p>Rio was still there. Not touching her. Not demanding anything. Just standing in it. In the mess. In the silence. In the wreckage of everything Agatha had tried to hold back.</p><p>And Agatha couldn’t look at her.<br/>
Because if she did, if she let her eyes meet Rio’s—she’d lose the last thread holding her upright. She could feel it already. The sting behind her eyes. The tremble in her ribs.</p><p>But Rio didn’t move away.<br/>
Didn’t leave.<br/>
Didn’t shout.</p><p>She stepped forward slowly. Steady. Deliberate.<br/>
And lifted her hand.</p><p>Agatha’s heart jumped. She flinched—just a flicker, not even a full motion—but Rio saw it. She always saw it. And still, her hand kept coming.</p><p>A soft, steady palm against her cheek. Barely there.</p><p>Agatha still didn’t look up.</p><p>Then—Rio’s thumb brushed under her eye.</p><p>That’s when Agatha felt it.<br/>
Wet.<br/>
Hot.</p><p>She hadn’t noticed. Hadn’t realised. But her cheeks were already damp.</p><p>She blinked. Another tear spilled.</p><p>Rio caught it.<br/>
Said nothing.</p><p>Just wiped it away like it wasn’t shocking. Like it wasn’t a crisis. Like she’d expected it—like she knew.</p><p>Agatha’s throat squeezed tight.<br/>
Her hands stayed clenched at her sides.</p><p>She was naked. Not just physically—though that hit her too. She was completely exposed. No excuses. No control. Just a raw, shivering thing standing in the middle of her own fears.</p><p>Then Rio’s other hand came up.<br/>
Joined the first.</p><p>She cupped Agatha’s face in both palms, like she was holding something breakable. Something holy.</p><p>Agatha still didn’t look at her.<br/>
Couldn’t.</p><p>The pressure in her chest built like a scream behind a locked door.</p><p>She didn’t know what this was—this tenderness. This quiet. This mercy in the face of rejection. But it was unbearable. It was cracking her open.</p><p>And Rio just held her.<br/>
Didn’t force her to speak.<br/>
Didn’t let her go.</p><p>The dam broke.</p><p>Agatha’s face crumpled.</p><p>It wasn’t a sob at first. Just a sound—small, torn from the back of her throat. Her shoulders curled in. Her whole body folded like she’d been struck.</p><p>Rio caught her.</p><p>Arms around her in an instant. One hand still on her cheek, the other behind her neck. Holding her steady. Holding her here.</p><p>Agatha pressed her face to Rio’s shoulder and finally let herself cry.</p><p>It was ugly. Shaking. Gasping. Like her body had forgotten how to fall apart properly. Years of tight-lipped control shredded in seconds—spilling onto bare skin and warm breath and the chest of the girl who refused to leave.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha choked against her neck, though she didn’t even know what for. “I’m sorry, I just—fuck—”</p><p>Rio didn’t hush her.<br/>
Didn’t say it was okay.<br/>
She just held her tighter. Let her shatter. Let her bleed it all out without flinching.</p><p>Like she wanted this.<br/>
Like she <em>needed</em> Agatha to stop pretending she didn’t feel it too.</p><p>And in that moment—that awful, silent, shaking moment—Agatha knew:<br/>
It was too late to go back.</p><p>Because this wasn’t casual.<br/>
Had never been casual.<br/>
Not for a second.</p><p>Her knees buckled. She didn’t even notice until Rio caught her. Again.</p><p>Like it was nothing.<br/>
Like she’d been ready.</p><p>She lowered them to the edge of the bed with terrifying gentleness. The kind that only made Agatha cry harder. The kind that made it real.</p><p>She couldn’t breathe. Not through the guilt. Not through the sobs. Her ribs stuttered, lungs collapsing like paper in the rain.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered again, barely there.</p><p>Rio didn’t speak.<br/>
Just pressed her forehead to Agatha’s temple. One hand splayed over her spine. The other still cupping her jaw like it was the only thing tethering her to the earth.</p><p>Agatha let herself be held.</p><p>Because she didn’t know how to ask for this. Not out loud.<br/>
Didn’t know how to say <em>please stay</em> without sounding desperate, or <em>I’m scared</em> without sounding ungrateful.<br/>
Didn’t know how to say <em>I want you</em> without feeling like a liar.</p><p>So she just curled in, raw and bare, until the sobs dulled. Until the storm passed.<br/>
Until all that remained was the soft, shuddering ache of aftermath—like she was a door someone had kicked in, hinges still swinging.</p><p>“I didn’t mean for it to be like this,” she said eventually, voice hoarse. “I didn’t mean to hurt you.”</p><p>Rio shifted. Just enough to look at her.</p><p>“Then why did you?” she asked. Not angry. Just... empty. Hollowed out and trying to understand. “Why do you keep pushing me away like I haven’t already seen the worst of you?”</p><p>Agatha’s throat clicked. She looked down.</p><p>“Because if I let myself want this,” she said quietly, “and it goes wrong…”</p><p>Rio waited.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “I don’t know if I’ll come back from it.”</p><p>There it was.<br/>
The truth, bleeding out of her like a wound that had waited years to open.</p><p>She met Rio’s eyes. Finally.</p><p>And hated what she saw.<br/>
Not pity. Not triumph.<br/>
Just that quiet, devastating look that said <em>me too</em>.</p><p>Rio reached up. Brushed the damp hair from Agatha’s forehead.</p><p>“I want this,” she said. Simple. Steady. Fierce. “I want <em>you</em>, Agatha. For real.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. A fresh tear slipped free.</p><p>“But if you keep pretending you don’t care…” Rio’s voice cracked. “I’ll start to believe you. And if that happens—I <em>will</em> walk away.”</p><p>It wasn’t a threat.<br/>
It was a truth.<br/>
A line drawn gently, but unmistakably, in the sand.</p><p>“I <em>do</em> care,” Agatha whispered. “I just… I don’t know how to do this.”</p><p>Rio exhaled—half a laugh, half a sigh. “Neither do I.”</p><p>Silence bloomed. Not empty. Heavy. Alive.</p><p>Agatha’s hand moved without thinking, fingers curling into the hem of Rio’s shirt like she needed something—<em>someone</em>—to hold onto.</p><p>Rio looked down at it. Then back at her.</p><p>“Can I stay?” she asked.<br/>
No games. No guard. Just truth.</p><p>Agatha hesitated.<br/>
Then nodded.<br/>
Once.<br/>
Shaky. Small. Real.</p><p>Rio exhaled like it was the first breath she hadn’t had to fight for.</p><p>She eased them both down into the bed, slow and careful, like she didn’t want to jostle the fragile peace between them. Her arms came around Agatha again, sure and steady. And Agatha let herself fall into them.</p><p>Not a kiss.<br/>
Not sex.<br/>
Just warmth. Skin. Breath. A closeness that felt almost unbearable in how much it asked for.</p><p>Agatha tucked her face in against Rio’s neck.</p><p>She stared at the place where Rio’s pulse beat steady beneath her skin.</p><p>She felt a kiss pressed to the top of her head.<br/>
Felt Rio’s arms tighten just slightly.</p><p>And in that quiet, Agatha breathed. Felt her body finally relax.</p><p>She was still scared.<br/>
Still unsure.</p><p>But she no longer felt alone.</p>

<p>Agatha blinked awake.</p><p>The room was dark—soft blue shadows pooling in the corners, a faint gold glow bleeding under the door from the hallway. Her limbs felt heavy. Her eyes gritty. Her body sore in a way that wasn’t exactly painful but still made her shift under the covers like she’d been wrung out and left to dry.</p><p>She didn’t know what time it was. Her phone was somewhere. Probably dead. Everything was quiet.</p><p>Too quiet.</p><p>And she was still naked. Still in her bed. But tucked in.</p><p>A sharp pulse of confusion went through her, quick and tight.</p><p>She didn’t remember falling asleep.</p><p>The last thing she remembered was—</p><p>Rio. Her hands. Her arms. Her voice, soft and close. <em>I’m not going anywhere.</em></p><p>Agatha sat up slowly, blanket slipping off her shoulder. Her skin was cool. Exposed. She pulled the sheet tighter around her chest and scanned the room.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>Her stomach dropped.</p><p>It wasn’t rational—she knew that—but the ache hit hard and fast anyway.</p><p>
<em>Rio was gone?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Of course she left. Of course. You fell asleep like a fucking idiot after sobbing all over her and now she’s done. She’s done. You pushed her too far. You always—</em>
</p><p>A crash broke the silence.</p><p>Metal on tile. A muffled curse.</p><p>Agatha startled so hard she nearly toppled off the bed. Then froze.</p><p>Because it was coming from the kitchen.</p><p>She held her breath.</p><p>Another sound—softer this time. A clink of something ceramic. A quiet hum. That voice.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Her heart squeezed so hard it felt like something inside her cracked.</p><p>She let out a breath. Pressed a hand to her chest.</p><p>Still here.</p><p>Still <em>here.</em></p><p>And the fear didn't go completely away—not really—but it changed shape. Melted into something smaller. Something that made her eyes sting and her ribs expand, and the thought <em>thank god</em> rattle loose in her head like a prayer she’d never admit to saying.</p><p>She gathered the blanket tighter around herself and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. Her knees cracked. Her body ached. Her hair was a crime.</p><p>But she stood.</p><p>Agatha paused at the doorway, glancing toward her dresser. A beat. Then another. Her eyes found the oversized shirt draped across the back of a chair in the corner—one of Rio’s, probably. Or maybe it was hers. Hard to tell anymore. It smelled like laundry detergent and something softer beneath it. Something lived-in. Like Rio.</p><p>She shrugged it on without thinking.</p><p>It hung off one shoulder, too big in the sleeves, loose around the waist. It didn’t quite cover everything, but it was enough to keep her from feeling completely bare. Her body still felt wrung out, like a wire that had finally gone slack, and part of her wanted to crawl back under the sheets and pretend she hadn’t panicked just now. But her feet were already moving.</p><p>The hallway was dim, but the kitchen glowed faintly ahead—soft, golden, like something out of a painting. She heard it again: the low hum of Rio’s voice. Not singing, exactly. More like murmuring to herself. And the clink of something being set down gently.</p><p>Agatha rounded the corner.</p><p>Silent as a ghost.</p><p>And Rio—barefoot bu the fridge, hoodie swallowing her frame, boxers slung low on her hips, face lit up like a painting in the fridge light—nearly jumped out of her skin when Agatha said, deadpan:</p><p>"This your version of a wake-up call?"</p><p>Rio yelped.</p><p>Actually yelped.</p><p>Then spun, hand to her chest like she’d just seen the devil. "Jesus Christ, Aggie!"</p><p>Agatha smirked, leaning against the doorframe. "Good morning to you too."</p><p>Rio recovered quickly, trying to cover the flinch with a scowl. "I was making you tea. And toast."</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. "You mean you were making noise and burning bread."</p><p>Rio gestured to the toaster. "I’ll have you know that my toast is perfectly edible. Probably."</p><p>A pause. Not awkward, just... full. Quiet buzz between them.</p><p>Agatha crossed the kitchen slowly, bare feet soft against the tile. She stopped beside the counter, glancing down at the mug Rio had abandoned.</p><p>Her fingers brushed the handle.</p><p> </p><p>“Chamomile?” she asked, voice lower now.</p><p>Rio nodded. “Didn’t know what else to do. Thought you might want something warm.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her. Really looked. And for once, didn’t try to look away.</p><p>“Why’d you stay?” she asked.</p><p>Rio leaned back against the counter. Shrugged one shoulder. “You were hurting. I didn’t want to leave you like that.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “You didn’t have to stay.”</p><p>“I wanted to,” Rio said simply. “Even if you’d kicked me out. I would've still made tea first.”</p><p>A beat.</p><p>“I keep fucking it up,” Agatha admitted.</p><p>Rio’s expression didn’t change. Just softened. “So do I.”</p><p>Agatha looked up. Surprised. “You?”</p><p>“I let you push me away too easily,” Rio said. “I pretended it didn’t hurt when it did. I pushed you too hard. I made rules so you wouldn’t run, but maybe I should’ve just... said how I felt. From the start.”</p><p>She paused.</p><p>“I should’ve told you I was falling.”</p><p>The words knocked the air out of Agatha’s lungs.</p><p>She blinked. “You were?”</p><p>Rio gave her a look. “Aggie. I <em>am.</em>”</p><p>Silence again. This one different. Stunned.</p><p>“I thought I was protecting myself,” Agatha whispered. “By staying in control. By keeping it simple. But I wasn’t.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer. “What were you doing?”</p><p>Agatha’s throat bobbed. “I was building a wall. And then wondering why it felt lonely inside it.”</p><p>Rio’s hand twitched, like she wanted to reach out but didn’t want to push.</p><p>Agatha saw it. Closed the gap herself, her hand wrapping around hers.</p><p>“I want to try,” she said. Voice trembling. “I don’t know what this is or where it could go. But I want to try.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes went soft, shiny at the edges. “Me too.”</p><p>They stood there for a breathless moment, nothing between them but air and everything they hadn’t said.</p><p>Then Rio tugged Agatha gently by the hand, pulling her in closer until their faces were only a breath away. Agatha’s breath caught, her eyes flicking down to Rio’s mouth before she closed the distance.</p><p>It was the softest kiss they’d ever shared. No smirk. No games. No pressure.<br/>Just lips. Just warmth. Just breath.</p><p>And it didn’t feel like breaking a rule.<br/>It felt like finally telling the truth.</p><p>Agatha’s hand found the front of Rio’s hoodie and curled into it without thinking. Not to pull her closer. Just to hold on. To anchor herself in the middle of the kitchen at what was probably 4AM, barefoot and bare-souled, wrapped in a shirt that wasn’t hers, kissing the girl who was.</p><p>Rio’s lips moved like she was memorising her. Careful. Slow. Like she was trying to carve this moment into her bones.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the smile that took over her face.<br/>A real one. Small. Unsteady.</p><p>The kiss broke, soft and natural, like a tide receding.<br/>And for a beat, their foreheads stayed pressed together.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught—then slipped out again in a quiet, breathy chuckle. Not sharp. Not mocking. Just full of something tired and tender and almost disbelieving.</p><p>Rio’s mouth tilted, the hint of a grin tugging at the corner. Her eyes fluttered open.</p><p>They were both smiling.</p><p>It wasn’t perfect. Wasn’t some movie-ending, fireworks-behind-the-eyes kind of moment. It was quiet. Fragile. Like if either of them breathed too hard, it might dissolve.</p><p>But it held.</p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to look at her properly. Her thumb brushed against the edge of Rio’s hoodie string, twisting it once. “You really made toast?”</p><p>Rio looked deeply offended. “You say that like it’s not a culinary achievement.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over her shoulder toward the toaster, where two very charred pieces of bread sat like tiny monuments to hubris. “You almost set off the smoke alarm again, didn’t you.”</p><p>Rio hesitated. “...I handled it.”</p><p>A soft snort escaped Agatha’s nose before she could stop it.</p><p>God. How long had it been since she’d felt like this?</p><p>Warm. Light. Like her chest wasn’t a war zone. Like she wasn’t two seconds away from bolting. Like maybe—<em>maybe</em>—this could be safe.</p><p>Rio scratched the back of her neck. “I panicked. You were sleeping. I didn’t want to leave, but I didn’t want to just sit there, and I thought maybe you’d want something when you woke up, and—yeah. Okay. I made the world’s worst breakfast.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers drifted to the edge of the counter. “I like that you tried.”</p><p>Rio looked at her for a long second. Then reached out and gently linked their pinkies together. Not a full handhold. Just that. Light. Careful. Like she didn’t want to startle her.</p><p>“You don’t have to say everything at once,” Rio murmured. “I know it’s a lot. I just… I need to know we’re on the same page. That you’re not going to pretend this doesn’t matter tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. Her voice was rough when it came. “It matters.”</p><p>“You matter,” Rio said, almost instantly. And then, quieter, like it slipped out: “You always did.”</p><p>Agatha blinked hard. Her throat felt thick again, but not from panic this time.</p><p>“I kept thinking,” she said, “that if I wanted this too much, it’d hurt more when it ended. So I tried to… ration it. Control it.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “How’s that working out for you?”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft, wry breath. “Terribly.”</p><p>A beat.</p><p>Then Rio stepped in closer. Their foreheads bumped lightly again.</p><p>“No more rules?” she asked.</p><p>“No more rules,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio grinned, relieved. “Even the no-sleepover one?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look. “Like we ever actually kept that one in the first place.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “True. I’ve basically lived here for a week. Should’ve started paying rent.”</p><p>“You contribute in your own way,” Agatha said, deadpan. “Mostly by taking up all the hot water and leaving your socks all over the apartment.”</p><p>Rio gasped, mock wounded. “Those socks are artistic statements. You’re just uncultured.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, the edge of a smirk tugging at her lips. “If by ‘artistic’ you mean mildly damp and hidden between the cushions on my lounge—”</p><p>“That happened once.”</p><p>“Twice.”</p><p>“Okay, but in my defense,” Rio murmured, stepping even closer, “you make it very hard to focus on laundry when you walk around in nothing but one of my shirts.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “So it’s <em>my</em> fault you’re a mess?”</p><p>“Completely,” Rio said, like it was obvious.</p><p>Their noses brushed. Agatha’s breath hitched, but her eyes stayed soft.</p><p>Then Rio kissed her again.</p><p>Not shy this time. Not tentative.</p><p>Just a slow, warm drag of lips. Familiar and new at once.</p><p>Agatha leaned into it with a small sound, her arms sliding up and around Rio’s neck. Her fingers found their way into her hair, curling there—soft but sure.</p><p>The kiss deepened for a moment. Then broke. Then started again, like a shared joke they didn’t want to end.</p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to whisper, “I can’t believe I almost ruined this.”</p><p>Rio shook her head gently. “You didn’t. You paused. We’re unpausing.”</p><p>Another kiss. Quick this time. A punctuation mark.</p><p>Agatha exhaled against her mouth. “God, you’re annoying.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “And yet. Still here.”</p><p>“You say that like it’s a flex.”</p><p>“It absolutely is.” She stole another kiss. “You’re not easy, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha hummed. “And you’re not subtle.”</p><p>Rio’s lips brushed her cheek. Her jaw. “You love it.”</p><p>“Unfortunately,” Agatha muttered, tilting her head to allow it. “Yeah. I think I do.”</p><p>They kept kissing—gentle, idle, stupid with affection. No agenda. Just the quiet thrill of <em>still here. Still yours.</em></p><p>Rio’s hand found Agatha’s waist under the hem of the shirt, fingers curling against bare skin.</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. Didn’t freeze.</p><p>She sighed. Relaxed into it. Smiled against Rio’s mouth.</p><p>And murmured, “You burn the toast again, I’m kicking you out.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Fair.”</p><p>Then kissed her again—longer this time. Slower. Like she had nowhere else to be.</p><p>Agatha's hands stayed tangled in her hair, thumb brushing lightly at the nape of her neck. She didn’t want to let go. Didn’t plan to.</p><p>Outside, the sky was shifting—dark blue fading to lavender, then pink. A soft bleed of morning creeping through the windows, filling the kitchen with light.</p><p>They didn’t notice it at first.</p><p>But Agatha looked over Rio’s shoulder. Watched the edges of the world begin to glow.</p><p>The sun was coming up.<br/>And for the first time in weeks, Agatha wasn’t afraid of the morning.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<strong>***</strong>
</p><p>Boxes were everywhere. Half-labelled, half-open, and mostly filled with things Agatha had forgotten she even owned.</p><p>Somewhere in the chaos was a toaster she hadn’t used since 2019. In another: three different mugs that said <em>World’s Best Boss,</em> none of which she remembered buying. Her back ached. Her knees crackled every time she crouched. Her hair was up in a clip that was hanging on for dear life and losing.</p><p>And Rio was singing off-key in the living room.</p><p>They were doing it.<br/>They were actually doing it.<br/><em>Moving in.</em><br/>Together.</p><p>Because what was the point of two rent payments when they were already inseparable? Agatha had spent the last four weeks waking up tangled in Rio’s sheets more often than her own. Her apartment had become a glorified laundry basket. Half her life had already migrated over—bras in the bathroom, snacks in the pantry, her favourite coffee mug showing up in Rio’s sink every morning like it had chosen a side.</p><p>It made sense.</p><p>What didn’t make sense was how they’d decided whose apartment to keep.</p><p>That had been a war.</p><p>Agatha had brought logic: more storage, better water pressure, glorious natural light.<br/>Rio had brought… other tactics.<br/>Tactics involving a “debate” that left Agatha flat on her back, gasping, thighs still trembling as Rio leaned over her and said smugly, “So. My place?”</p><p>Agatha had muttered, “This is emotional manipulation.”<br/>Rio had kissed her shoulder and replied, “No, it’s just really good sex.”</p><p>Agatha had grumbled. But she’d agreed.</p><p>On one condition.</p><p>“As soon as we can,” she’d said the next morning, tugging Rio’s hoodie over her head, “we move out of this complex. I’m tired of the neighbours giving us the ‘we-heard-you-last-night’ face every time we walk past.”</p><p>Rio—holding two coffees and exactly zero shame—had just said, “To be fair, they <em>did</em> hear us last night. We were loud.”</p><p><em>You were loud,</em> Agatha had corrected, snatching her mug.</p><p>Rio had winked. “You loved it.”</p><p>Agatha had not responded.</p><p>Now, a month later, their lives were spilling into the same drawers. One apartment. Two toothbrushes. Three kinds of oat milk because neither of them remembered which one they actually liked.</p><p>Agatha stood in the doorway, surrounded by the chaos of moving—boxes and stray socks and the unmistakable scent of takeout—and watched Rio crouch in front of a half-assembled bookshelf with the wrong screwdriver and an alarming amount of confidence.</p><p>It was meant to be a bookshelf.<br/>So far, it looked like a modern art piece titled <em>Lesbian Failure.</em></p><p>Agatha stepped over a box labelled <em>winter stuff?</em>—a lie; it contained one mitten and a tangled phone charger—and leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed.</p><p>“Wrong screwdriver,” she said, sipping lukewarm coffee from a chipped mug that neither of them could claim ownership of.</p><p>Rio didn’t look up. “No, it’s not.”</p><p>“It absolutely is.”</p><p>“I know what I’m doing.”</p><p>“You really don’t.”</p><p>“I’m building us a future,” Rio muttered.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Out of pine composite and blind optimism?”</p><p>“IKEA is a metaphor, Aggie. Let me work.”</p><p>Her lips twitched, but she didn’t quite smile. Not fully. Not yet. It still felt too new. Too fragile. This whole thing—boxes and keys and toothbrush holders. There was a shelf in the bathroom now with both their skincare. Side by side. Like it had always been that way.</p><p>Like this wasn’t something that could still shatter.</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>It was too quiet again, save for the occasional clink of tools and Rio’s soft curses. The apartment smelled like cardboard, clean sweat, and the vaguely citrusy detergent Rio used on her hoodies. Agatha had thrown one on this morning without thinking. The sleeves hung over her fingers, ridiculous and soft, and somehow that made her feel more exposed than being naked.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “If this shelf collapses and crushes your foot, I’m not taking you to the hospital.”</p><p>“Rude.”</p><p>“I’ll call you an Uber. That’s love.”</p><p>She froze.</p><p>
<em>Love.</em>
</p><p>The word snapped like a rubber band in the air between them. Too casual. Too dangerous. Too close to something she hadn’t dared name.</p><p>She felt it the second it left her mouth. The atmosphere shifted. Subtle. Sharp. Like a dropped plate that hadn’t shattered—yet.</p><p>Rio looked up.</p><p>Not startled. Not smug. Just… still.</p><p>Agatha didn’t dare meet her eyes.</p><p>
<em>Fuck. Fuck.</em>
</p><p>It didn’t count. It was a joke. A throwaway. People said <em>that’s love</em> all the time. It didn’t mean—</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said. Soft. No heat. Just her name, like it meant something.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat again, louder. “Don’t read into it.”</p><p>“I didn’t say anything.”</p><p>“You’re doing the face.”</p><p>“What face?”</p><p>“The one that means you’re thinking.”</p><p>“I’m always thinking.”</p><p>“Exactly. Stop.”</p><p>Rio leaned back on her heels. Her hoodie had a smear of something—grease? chocolate? glue?—and she looked like she hadn’t slept in two days.</p><p>She looked like home.</p><p>Agatha hated how badly she wanted to say it again.</p><p>Instead, she shrugged. “Shelf’s still broken.”</p><p>Rio didn’t blink. “You meant it, didn’t you?”</p><p>Silence settled in the spaces between boxes and tangled extension cords.</p><p>Agatha hesitated. Her skin prickled. She wished Rio would go back to fumbling screws or talking nonsense about symbolism. Anything but this.</p><p>She swallowed. “What if I did?”</p><p>It cracked something open. Quiet, trembling, real.</p><p>Rio didn’t smirk. Didn’t deflect.</p><p>Then, softly: “Then I guess you’re not the only one.”</p><p>Agatha finally looked at her.</p><p>And Rio was still there.</p><p>Kneeling in cardboard, surrounded by mess, ridiculous in every possible way—and still here.</p><p>The breath left Agatha’s lungs in a stuttering exhale.</p><p>Then she dropped to her knees beside her.</p><p>Not graceful. Her knee cracked loudly. A corner of a box stabbed her in the calf. She didn’t care.</p><p>She reached out and plucked the screwdriver from Rio’s hand.</p><p>“I’ve got it,” she said, voice low but steady. “Before you finish whatever crime against geometry you’ve started.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “I loosened one screw.”</p><p>“And tilted the entire shelf like it’s auditioning to be the Leaning Tower of Pisa.” Agatha squinted at the lopsided mess. “Honestly, I don’t even know how you managed to get that mirror on the wall across from the bed with this level of skill.”</p><p>Rio choked. “It’s secure!”</p><p>“It’s diagonal.”</p><p>“It’s <em>artful!</em>”</p><p>“It’s <em>horny.</em>”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Well, yeah.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, inspecting the mess in front of them. She lined up the screwdriver—too short, the wrong shape entirely—and sighed. “Unreal. I fall in love with a woman who strategically mounts sex mirrors like a pervert.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched.</p><p>Agatha noticed.<br/>Of course she noticed.</p><p>She didn’t look up. Just adjusted her grip and jammed the too-small screwdriver into the misaligned screw with the grim determination of someone who’d decided love meant improvising.</p><p>It groaned in protest. So did her wrist.</p><p>But the screw turned.</p><p>Agatha smirked, faint and fond. “This is the wrong tool, you know.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “It’s the only one we have.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha murmured, twisting it tighter. “So I’m making it work.”</p><p>She felt Rio still holding her breath beside her.</p><p>Then: “You said it again,” Rio said, voice quiet. Not teasing. Just... soft.</p><p>“Did I?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha twisted one more screw into place, steady now, even as her pulse picked up. She didn’t look away from the shelf. But her voice was gentler than it had been in days. “Well,” she muttered. “I do.”<br/>Then she looked at her. Met her eyes, fully and completely.<br/>“I love you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move. Then she scooched forward, cardboard creaking beneath her knees, until she was right there beside her—elbow to elbow. Shoulder to shoulder.</p><p>“You mean that?” she asked—not doubting, just confirming. Needing to hear it one more time.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah. I mean it.”</p><p>Her voice didn’t shake.</p><p>Her hands did.</p><p>Rio leaned in and kissed her.</p><p>No bells. No crescendo.</p><p>Just warm lips and the scent of home. The heat of skin and familiarity and the quiet knowledge that sometimes, after everything, you still get to choose someone.</p><p>Agatha sighed into it. Her fingers curled in the front of Rio’s hoodie like they were built to fit there.</p><p>When they pulled apart, foreheads rested together. Still close. Still breathing the same breath.</p><p>Rio’s voice was quiet. “I love you too, you know.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.<br/>Let the words settle into her bones. Let herself believe them.</p><p>She smiled—slow, unsteady. Like it snuck up on her.</p><p>Because this girl—this ridiculous, chaotic, barefoot girl in a hoodie and grease-stained boxers, surrounded by cardboard and half-built furniture—had wormed her way into Agatha’s life with bad jokes and stubborn warmth and a mouth that never knew when to quit.</p><p>And God help her.<br/>She was everything Agatha had said she didn’t want.<br/>Too young. Too loud. Too much.</p><p>And somehow…<br/>She was everything Agatha needed.</p><p>Her thumb brushed the edge of Rio’s jaw. Light. Thoughtless.</p><p>“Turns out,” she whispered, “you’re exactly my type.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curled into a grin. “Knew it.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, smiling anyway. “God, you’re annoying.”</p><p>Rio kissed her again—quick, smug, unbearable.</p><p>“And yet,” she murmured against her mouth, “you’re tragically in love with me.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t argue.<br/>Didn’t pull away.</p><p>She just let herself stay.</p><p>Because somehow in the middle of cardboard chaos and a bookshelf that still leaned a little too far left, this wasn’t a disaster waiting to happen.</p><p>This was home.</p>
