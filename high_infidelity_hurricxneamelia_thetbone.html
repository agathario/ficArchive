<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Disneyland. Chuck E. Cheese. Sky Zone. All cesspools crawling with pee and screaming children but all places Agatha was prepared to brave for Nicky when she’d asked him where he wanted to go during their (too-short, unfair, single) week of summer vacation together. </p><p>She should’ve known he wasn’t going to pick a normal place. Nicky wasn’t a normal six-year-old. Nicky was peculiar. Nicky was exceptional. And Nicky was… </p><p>Well, Nicky was sick. Cystic fibrosis. </p><p>Nicky’s being sick certainly wasn’t the reason for her divorce. They were mismatched from the beginning — Agatha was a “cold, selfish bitch” (Wanda’s words), and Wanda was an “insufferable, sanctimonious cunt” (Agatha’s) — but it had likely sped up the inevitable. </p><p>Nicky was also a trooper, weathering a nasty disease and an equally nasty custody battle without ever losing the smile that made Agatha’s entire world turn. That made her life worth living.  </p><p>And so because he had spent the vast majority of his life in waiting rooms and courtrooms, doctor’s offices and lawyer’s offices, Agatha had told him he could go anywhere he wanted. </p><p>Sicily. He’d picked Sicily. Apparently, he’d learned about it in some book Wanda had read him during one of their many weeks together. (Agatha only got Wednesdays and every other weekend — and she was apparently lucky for that considering her “checkered past,” as her lawyer had said. She didn’t feel very lucky. She felt like she wanted to stab someone in the throat. It only seemed fair. She felt like she was being stabbed in the heart every time she had to say goodbye to her son for any length of time.) </p><p>Agatha wasn’t wealthy — especially not after the outrageous pile of medical bills and mountain of lawyers’ fees — but she was resourceful. And smart. And she would do absolutely anything for her little boy.  </p><p>And so some light credit card fraud later, she found herself on a boat to a luxury resort surrounded by people who were decidedly not resourceful or smart — people who got everything handed to them on a silver fucking platter. Self-righteous people. The privileged elite who thought they were better than her. People like her ex-wife and her ex-wife's lawyer and her own lawyer and the judge and Nicky's pediatrician and the first specialist and the second specialist and— well, she could go on.</p><p>Agatha scans them, ever watchful and aware of her surroundings. It was a habit at this point, to assess risks and threats and marks and opportunities. It was always good to figure out the dynamics from the get-go — figure out who everyone was so she could strategize how she could play them. If this boat crashed on a deserted island, for example, who would be useful to align herself with, and who should she convince everyone to eat first? </p><p>Agatha wasn’t good with people, but she was good <em>at</em> people. She had to be to survive.</p><p>There’s a stylish bald woman dripping with wealth and her alternative…assistant? Girlfriend? Whatever. Agatha writes them both off almost immediately as irrelevant. They were too self-involved to be dangerous to Agatha but too skeptical to be advantageous — not to mention too irritating to tolerate. They wouldn’t try to take anything from Agatha, but Agatha wouldn’t be able to get anything from being in proximity to them either.</p><p>The pair is sitting next to a kooky woman adorned with ridiculous handmade jewelry she almost certainly paid way too much for and hair so big it made her look like Albert Einstein's much more gullible sister. Agatha files her away as a potential target. As easy money. She could get a couple thousand bucks at least by selling her bullshit shell necklaces or artisanal sea glass she claimed was a rare treasure of the ocean.</p><p>Then there’s a beefy, clean-shaven white man who looks remarkably like a thumb resting his hand on the thigh of a younger Latina woman. Trophy wife. She’s admittedly sexy — far out of his league, that’s for damn sure — but undoubtedly stupid as hell, a fact that’s further confirmed as she has the gall to give Agatha a pitiful smile. Because Nicky is using his PEP mask, most likely. Agatha scowls and pulls him closer to her side.</p><p>The woman blinks, face immediately falling. Serves her fucking right. Agatha hated these two on sight. If the quirky old woman was going to be easy to manipulate and the girlboss and her sidekick were neutral territory, these two were born at the top of the food chain and, in Agatha’s not-so-humble opinion, had no business being there.</p><p>Thankfully, the woman doesn’t have the nerve or audacity to look at her the rest of the ride, but Agatha watches her and her hideous, always-failing-up husband as Nicky loudly rattles off facts about Italy. It’s a little annoying, frankly, but it’s better than listening to the rich Black woman talking the Asian woman’s ear off about recycled lotion or organic beauty blenders or something equally, mind-numbingly stupid. </p><p>The Latina doesn’t say much — just turns down the champagne one of the employees offers her. </p><p>What a fucking square.</p><hr/><p>Rio isn’t sure what she did wrong. Rio’s never sure what she does wrong, but she seems to be doing it all the time. She’s not talking enough — she’s talking too much. She’s not drinking enough — she’s drinking too much. She’s not being friendly enough — she’s being too friendly. There are so many rules, and she can’t seem to follow them. Not to Thanos’ liking, at least, and apparently, not to this brunette woman’s either.</p><p>Somehow, Rio is always doing wrong. Somehow, Rio is always <em>feeling</em> wrong. And she has been since…since when? Since she said, ‘I do’? Since she said, ‘Yes,’ when he got down on one knee? Since she said, ‘Okay,’ when he asked her on a date? </p><p>She married him anyway (though he hurts her and always will no matter how many times he promises he won’t anymore). She fucks him anyway (though she’s not attracted to him and never has been). She came on this vacation anyway (though their getaways are always far from relaxing; though Rio has not relaxed since she met him). Maybe it’s not what love is supposed to be, but it’s what it is now.</p><p>Rio will grin and bear it, even as everyone whispers she’s with him for his money despite the fact she’s a lawyer. Despite the fact she used to make more than him until one of his investments paid out better than anyone could have ever anticipated. They were always well off — had first-class-ticket, chartering-a-yacht, luxury-hotel money — but now they had private-jet, buying-their-own-boat, owning-a-private-island money.</p><p>Rio doesn’t give a shit about any of that, but she will pretend to. She will make do. She has to if she wants to survive.</p><p>But she will also relish any second she can get away from him. She feels her shoulders relax the smallest bit as Thanos tells her to hang back as he gets their room key — feels herself breathe a little easier despite the fact she finds herself standing next to the hostile brunette woman.</p><p>Rio hates tension. Being with Thanos, Rio has had to get good at defusing it.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I offended you on the boat or something,” Rio tells her. “I’ve been told sometimes my facial expressions don’t come off right. I was just trying to say hi.”</p><p>“And you couldn’t manage it?” the woman dryly quips back, glancing at her with a raised brow. “You tried to say hi and found you were unable to do so?”</p><p>Rio grimaces. She’s demeaned in public all the time, but the embarrassment never fades. She’s not sure if it’s worse coming from her husband or a stranger. “Small talk isn’t usually my thing, but you seemed the least insufferable out of everyone on the boat. I was trying to non-verbally greet you.”</p><p>“Top 10%,” she coolly replies.</p><p>Rio furrows her brows. “What?”</p><p>“Of the most insufferable people on the boat. I found you to be in the top 10%.”</p><p>“Oh.” She sucks in a breath. “Any reason? I was minding my own business.”</p><p>“Is that what you call staring at my son like he’s some Make-a-Wish kid?”</p><p>“I wasn’t…staring. Or assuming anything about him,” she stutters. It’s not a lie, but her face flushes anyway.</p><p>“Bullshit. Everyone makes assumptions about everyone all the time. I, for instance, assume that oversized frat boy getting your room key is your husband?” The woman nods toward Thanos. “I assume he’s in tech or finance — the same industry his daddy works in. The same company, too. I assume he probably gave you the wedding of your dreams but never, ever an orgasm. Please, dear — do stop me if I have it wrong.”</p><p>Her cheeks grow hotter, some rage now mixed in with the humiliation. “Actually, his father fired him because he was so bad at his job — he’s only recently started making any real money. I paid for the wedding. I’m a lawyer — civil and human rights. And people do make assumptions. The assumption I made about you is that you weren’t a snobby rich person. I now realize I was wrong.” </p><p>Fuck, she’s said too much. She’s said far, far too much. Screw this woman for baiting her like that. For making her crack so easily. She has to get away. She has to get away <em>now</em>.</p><p>“I’ll see you around,” she says, ducking her head as she reluctantly goes to join Thanos at the concierge. He didn’t like it when she talked to people he didn’t know. He certainly didn’t like it when she aired their business. Made him out to be anything less than the perfect husband.</p><p>The woman steps in front of her, blocking her path. “So you assumed I was poor? That I don’t have enough money to be here? Is that it?”</p><p>“No, I just assumed you weren’t wealthy enough to be completely out of touch.”</p><p>She puts a hand to her heart and adopts a thick Southern accent. “Well, ain’t that just the sweetest backhanded compliment I ever heard.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “No one is calling you poor. I <em>am</em> calling you a presumptuous asshole, though.” She once again steps around her to join Thanos. He didn’t like it when she cursed either — felt it unladylike — but this woman was making her break all the rules. Become someone she wasn’t. Or at least, had never allowed herself to be.</p><p>The woman obnoxiously mirrors the movement, landing in front of her once again. “How do you figure? Sounds like everything I said was pretty spot-on. Unless he <em>has</em> made you cum..." She glances over her shoulder at him. "Though I sincerely doubt that."</p><p>Rio grits her teeth, lowering her voice now — anxious that Thanos might retaliate if he heard her talking to this infuriating woman. “You assumed I thought badly about your kid, which I didn’t," she hisses. "You assumed I was a gold digger, which I’m not. What’s your problem?”</p><p>“People like you,” she answers simply. </p><p>They’re interrupted by the sound of tiny footsteps running toward them from the bathroom. “Mama!” the little boy from the boat says. “Can we go to the pool now?” </p><p>The woman turns to him, leaning down to tenderly ruffle his hair as if she hadn’t just committed verbal warfare against Rio. “Of course, sweetheart. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>Rio feels like she might cry. <em>She’s</em> not the problem here, and what’s worse is that she has no one to tell about the interaction, much less complain about it to. Her husband would be upset — at both the woman and herself, no doubt — and she wasn’t about to put herself through that. She wouldn’t even want to put the woman through that, as obnoxious as she was. She wouldn’t wish Thanos’ rage on her worst enemy, which is exactly what that woman might very well become if she ever saw her again.</p><p>Contrary to what that woman seemed to think, Rio wasn’t born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She was raised by a single father in a small town in Puerto Rico — a loving father, yes, but one who couldn’t help her pay for college. One who certainly couldn't help her pay for law school. Rio busted her ass in high school to get a small scholarship and then busted her ass working multiple minimum wage jobs — retail, waitressing, nannying, you name it — to cover the rest. And that’s not even mentioning the ungodly amount of student loans she took out. </p><p>God, that woman was a bitch. An effortlessly beautiful bitch.</p><p>With the indulgence of one final sigh, Rio attempts to put her out of her mind as she straightens her shoulders and finally walks over to Thanos. “What do you want to do first?”</p><p>He flexes a bicep, room key now in hand. “I was thinking we could hit up the gym. I have to get my reps in — the grind never stops. Plus, I don’t want my lady getting chunky.” He slaps her ass before giving it a squeeze. “All those <em>Italiano</em> carbs.”</p><p>Rio grimaces, flinching away ever so slightly. She’s small — she’s always been small — but that doesn’t make her feel any less insecure when her husband constantly comments on her body. “Sounds good. Let’s head up to the room and change then?”</p><p>“Sure thing, babe.” He nods, shaggy blonde hair bouncing as they walk. He looks over at her with a conspiratorial grin. “I booked us the honeymoon suite.”</p><p>She wrinkles her brows. “But we aren’t on our honeymoon. And isn’t that more expensive?”</p><p>“I wanted to do something romantic for you. No need to thank me. Or, well, I can think of a different way you can thank me later.” He winks, poking the inside of his cheek with his tongue in a very unsubtle gesture. “And we’re loaded now, thanks to Stark Pharmaceuticals," he says with a laugh.</p><p>Rio hums as he opens the door. It’s…nice, admittedly. Rose petals on the bed. Giant balcony overlooking the ocean. Heart-shaped tub in the corner of the enormous space with towels folded into swans — something that’s overkill but somehow not as tacky as one might think. She’d rather be sharing it with just about anyone else, though.</p><p>“Loaded with what?” she asks, setting her purse down on the couch. The staff had already brought their suitcases up, assembled them neatly in the corner.</p><p>Thanos laughs. “Anything we want, babe. We’re richer than god now.”</p><p>“I think I’ll stick to my edibles,” she casually declares. She wouldn’t necessarily be opposed to trying something else — something a little harder — but she’s not going to do it with him. It’s awful, but she has this fear he might take advantage of her. It’s awful, but she knows it’s not an altogether irrational one. </p><p>“You’re so cute and clueless.” He shakes his head with a chuckle as he pulls off his shirt. “Stark Pharmaceuticals is the company I invested in. The reason we now have half a billion dollars to our name.”</p><p>Oh. Right. Rio knew that. She wishes she hadn’t known that — had tried to block it from her mind and apparently managed to succeed until this very moment — but she did know that. As much as she attempted to ignore his work, some information inevitably slipped through. As does her next comment of distaste, “They’re corrupt as hell.” </p><p>Thanos scoffs. “Tony’s not corrupt.”</p><p>“He is,” Rio argues, changing into a sports bra and leggings. “His clinical trials are always fishy, and he exploits substance abuse in the country by lying about the side effects of things.”</p><p>“Blah, blah, blah. He’s my fraternity brother, and he let me get in on a really sick deal. Plus, he did actually hook us up — a little coke, a little molly.”</p><p>She doesn’t even want to know how he got that shit through customs. Frankly, she’s a little disappointed he did. Didn’t get arrested at the airport. She turns to face him, putting her hair up. “Thanos…”</p><p>“It’s no biggie — everyone does drugs on vacation. And fucking while high is the best.”</p><p>“For you. Last time you kept going when I said I was done.”</p><p>“Because <em>I</em> wasn’t.” He slips on a pair of shorts, casual as can be as if that’s not a huge fucking problem. Rio’s not about to make it one. Things never end well when there’s a huge fucking problem.</p><p>She rolls her eyes. “I don’t want to talk about this anymore.”</p><p>“That’s new. All you women ever seem to want to do is talk.”</p><p>She doesn’t dignify that with a response, venturing to the gym without glancing back.</p><p>Unfortunately, he’s got about a foot on her, easily catching up to her even after taking the time to slip on his tennis shoes. He possessively takes her arm in his. To the naked eye, it’d look merely protective — romantic even. He was good at appearances. They both were. “You’re acting like an ungrateful little bitch," he whisper-hisses.</p><p>“I’m not ungrateful,” she replies, stiffening the slightest bit in his hold.</p><p>“Then why do you keep complaining about every little thing?”</p><p>“I’m not complaining.” She looks at him, some odd combination of challenge and repentance in her eyes. “What do you want me to do to make you see that I’m not complaining?”</p><p>“You could start by not whining about how I have sex with you or make my money.”</p><p>“You say that as if I’m not an autonomous person.” She’s not, of course, but she wants him to be forced to at least acknowledge that. How sick this all is.</p><p>He doesn’t, of course. He never does.</p><p>“I say that as someone who knows what a complaint sounds like,” he retorts. “I could have any piece of ass I want, but I chose yours, and sometimes, I don’t think you realize how lucky that makes you.”</p><p>Rio grits her teeth. “Stop treating me like I’m just a pretty girl on your arm. I make money and have a personality, you know.” She doesn’t know why she’s so riled up. This treatment was relatively tame, all things considered. The infuriating, attractive woman had completely thrown her off her game.</p><p>“Your salary’s a drop in the bucket now, and your personality fucking sucks at the moment.”</p><p>Rio sighs. She could not pick this battle. “Let’s just work out, okay?”</p><p>“I’m gonna hit the tread before I lift,” he says, letting go of her arm like nothing ever happened. And it didn't. Nothing ever happened to him.</p><p>Rio spends the next hour lifting weights. Thanos always told her to go easy on them — didn’t like his woman looking too muscular either — but she loved them. They made her feel strong. Powerful. More in control.  </p><p>By the time she leaves the gym, she’s sweating. She’s also alone once again, with Thanos announcing he wants to get extra reps in. His technique is god awful, and Rio finds herself hoping that bites him in the ass. Makes him sprain something. Break something. Even kill him, maybe.</p><p>She’s looking down at her phone, skipping a song on her playlist, when she nearly bumps into someone. She resists the urge to curse when she sees it’s the woman from earlier. Because of course it fucking is.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she says, taking her earbud out. Apologizing had become second nature. Habitual.</p><p>The woman lets out a deep sigh. “<em>Do</em> watch where you’re going, won’t you?”</p><p>“Yeah,” she mutters. “My bad.” </p><p>The combination of her tiff with Thanos and the workout has made her too tired to snark back, leaving her with no energy to match the woman’s. She’s also suddenly, annoyingly self-conscious of the way she looks. Thanos judges her, so surely this woman would, too. Any appetite she might have had from exercising disappears. She crosses her arms protectively across her chest.</p><p>The woman cocks a brow, raising her chin. “Where are you off to in such a rush anyway?”</p><p>“Just my room. I need to get away from him.” Fuck. She’s said too much again. Why did this woman have that effect on her?</p><p>The woman blinks, mask faltering for the briefest second before reappearing as if it’d never fallen at all. “The room you’re presumably sharing with him? That he has a key to? Seems an odd hiding place, hon.”</p><p>Rio’s already dug her hole, made her bed, done all of the cliche things that mean she’s screwed — she may as well dig it deeper, lie in it, etc. “He’ll be upset if I go anywhere else. Right now, he’s too busy staring at himself in the mirror while he lifts weights with poor form.”</p><p>“Hm.” The woman grunts in disapproval. “Think I’d do my best to avoid any and all reflective surfaces if I were him.”</p><p>Rio laughs — an awkward, unexpected sound but a genuine one nonetheless. She hasn’t laughed much lately. “I wish I could tell him that to his face.”</p><p>“I don’t see any reason why you couldn’t. You have a mouth; he has a face, ugly as it may be.”</p><p>Her laughter stops at that. This woman doesn’t understand. Nobody understood. “I— He wouldn’t like that. It wouldn’t be good.”</p><p>“Well, no — that’s precisely the fun of it. Believe me, pissing men off is much more fun than stroking their undersized penises and oversized egos.”</p><p>“He wouldn't react well. I'm not trying to make my life miserable."</p><p>“What’s miserable is feeling like you have to bite your tongue all the time.” A beat. “I can imagine. I’ve never actually experienced that instinct before.” The woman shrugs.</p><p>It is miserable, Rio thinks. But it’s her normal. Maybe it’s even her fault. She doesn’t know anymore. “Lucky you.”</p><p>The woman squares her shoulders. “I make my own luck.”</p><p>What must that be like, she wonders. “I’m Rio, by the way. I don’t think I ever said my name.”</p><p>The woman sticks out her hand. “Agatha. Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Rio hums and shakes it. For some reason, this woman — in all of her insufferable haughtiness — is magnetic. “That’s a pretty name. Powerful.”</p><p>“Mm, yes — the one and only thing my mother did right was choosing it.”</p><p>“I can understand that maybe.” Rio thinks of her own mother, gone shortly after her first birthday, never to return.</p><p>“Well, the harpy’s dust now.” Agatha waves her free hand. “Past is the past. I have more relevant feuds to foster."</p><p>“With whom?”</p><p>“Roughly 30% of New Jersey. Percentage doubles if we zero in on the town of Westview.”</p><p>Rio furrows her brow. “Why?”</p><p>“Precisely 0% your business.”</p><p>She holds her hands up in surrender. “Sorry.”</p><p>“My god, you apologize a lot. It’s excruciatingly boring.”</p><p>“Well, it tends to happen when your husband gaslights you until you don’t know left from right.” Again, there was the whole business with the already dug hole and the already made bed. And maybe crude honesty would shock Agatha into not being a raging asshole.</p><p>No dice, apparently. Agatha is unfazed. “Sounds like it’s time for a divorce. I would not recommend my attorney. Overpriced cunt.”</p><p>“Being an apathetic cunt isn’t cute either,” she hears herself retorting. “And if you remember — which you probably don't because you probably weren't actually listening — I’m a lawyer myself.”</p><p>“Ohh, aren’t we a feisty little thing?” Agatha asks, amused. “Believe it or not, dear, I was just trying to help, but I’ll nip that right in the bud — I’m not in the habit of helping people who are unwilling to help themselves. Be your own attorney then. Or don’t.” She shrugs. “It really has no bearing on my life.”</p><p>Rio sighs, running a hand down her face. This is really not her day. “Look, it’s more complicated than that. Today, he’s a dick, and I’m pissed at him. Tomorrow, he’ll be sweet, and I’ll feel bad for ever thinking that way. I know, objectively, it’s…not great, but I’m trying to get there.” She’s being honest with Agatha, and in the process, she’s being honest with herself — maybe for the first time in her life. She’s never said the quiet part out loud before.</p><p>“It doesn’t sound complicated. It sounds simple and incredibly fucking bleak to me.”</p><p>“That’s what everyone says. At least people who don’t understand what it’s like.” Which did, in fact, seem to be ‘everyone.’ Rio shakes her head. This was so stupid. <em>She</em> was so stupid. “I’ll see you,” she says, making a move to go around her.</p><p>Agatha easily steps in front of her once more — it was quickly becoming their little dance. Rio wants to shove her hard out of the way, forget about her. Rio wants her to do it again and again and again, see her every day for the rest of her life. </p><p>“You do that a lot, don’t you?” Agatha asks. “Start a conversation and then abruptly end it when you don’t like what you hear?”</p><p>“I end a conversation when I’m being disrespected,” she says firmly, her court voice coming out. “If you’re interested in actually learning about me and my situation, we can talk at a bar or something — not a hallway.”</p><p>“You’ll end a conversation but not a marriage. How peculiar.” Agatha tilts her head, squinting at her. “Okay, you can buy me a drink."</p><p>She thinks, 'Fuck no, you crazy bitch — I was obviously just calling your bluff.'</p><p>She says, “Tomorrow? After dinner?”</p><p>“Why not tonight?" Agatha replies. "After dinner?”</p><p>“I don’t want to deal with the drama of telling him I’ve made last-minute plans.” She’s never this blunt — not outside her job — but bluntness seems to work for Agatha.</p><p>“Oh.” She blinks. “I suppose it didn’t cross my mind that you were actually planning on telling him the truth. I forget people do that — the whole honesty thing.”</p><p>“Tomorrow,” Rio simply replies. “Hotel bar. 8pm.”</p><p>“8:30,” Agatha coolly corrects. “I put Nicky to bed at 8, and he makes me sing at least two songs before he’ll even shut his eyes.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio agrees, sidestepping her once again — successfully this time. “See you then.”</p><p>She doesn’t know what the fuck just came over her, what the fuck just possessed her to do that, who the fuck that person impersonating Rio was back there just now.</p><p>And she doesn’t know what the fuck this feeling in her stomach is either — some awful cocktail of anxiety and fear and regret. So much regret.</p><p>And she doesn’t know why the fuck she’s smiling. Why the fuck she feels giddy and alive and so much like herself for the first time in a long, long while.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Dinner with Thanos…well, it happens. Rio mostly dissociates through it — pretends she’s somewhere else. (Lying by the ocean, floating in the pool, already having drinks with Agatha.) The trend continues as he fucks her — pretends he’s someone else. (Penélope Cruz, that paralegal who works at her friend’s office, Agatha.)</p><p>He’s rough. Too rough. Rough in a way that’s not at all enjoyable for her, though she can’t imagine it’d be all that enjoyable for her if he was gentle either. It’s not the roughness that’s the problem. Still, she lets him do it without complaint, needing him in a good mood for when she turns out the light a little after midnight and says, “I’m meeting a friend for drinks tomorrow.”</p><p>“Friend?” he asks, voice laced with suspicion. “What friend?”</p><p>“I met her here.” Then, “She’s a mom. She and I talked about kids. Thought she could give me some advice.” She’s trying to play into the housewife of it all — his perfect, submissive fantasy.</p><p>It works like a charm. God, Thanos was so predictable — except when he wasn’t. “That’s great, babe. You know I want at least three, and you’re not getting any younger.” He puts a hand on her stomach. She resists the urge to squirm or slap it away.</p><p>“What do you mean ‘at least’? What’s your ideal number?”</p><p>“I dunno. Four? Five?” he says flippantly. “Does this mean you’re finally thinking about quitting that silly little job of yours?”</p><p>Rio frowns. “No. I like work.”</p><p>“Well, soon, you’ll be doing more important work — cooking our basketball team of kids…” He rubs her belly. “And then cooking <em>for</em> our basketball team of kids.” He laughs at his own joke.</p><p>“My job is important, too,” she mumbles, closing her eyes. “I wouldn’t be picking between them.”</p><p>He gives the skin of her stomach a squeeze. “Motherhood is the most important job a woman can have. It’s a biological fact.”</p><p>She clenches her jaw. “You’re conflating a biological purpose with a societally defined role.”</p><p>“You getting all academic is such a boner-killer,” he whines.</p><p>“Good,” she mutters, rolling onto her side. “I need to sleep,” </p><p>He removes his hand from her stomach. “God, what happened to you? You used to be fun — not this…this uptight feminazi.”</p><p>She doesn’t respond, curling into herself and willing sleep. She’s always been miserable, but talking to Agatha so candidly…it’s like it finally made her realize just <em>how</em> miserable.</p><p>Thanos huffs, put out, before shoving himself out of bed. “I’m going for a nightcap.”</p><hr/><p>Luckily for Rio, that nightcap must have turned into two or three or four, as Thanos is still dead asleep by the time she wakes up the next morning, meaning she can start her day with some too-rare, much coveted alone time. She skips breakfast and heads straight to the beach, sending him a text to let him know what cabana she’ll be in. </p><p>Reading and swimming take up most of the morning. At one point, the exhaustion of it — the inherent toll that living with him takes on her — hits, and she lies sprawled out on her chair, people-watching. A couple walking hand-in-hand. A child picking up shells. A group of teen girls giggling, huddling around a phone. They seem happy. She wonders if they really are. Rio probably seemed happy, too. Seemed like she lived a fairytale life.</p><p>A while into observing this carousel of people, she sees a little boy frantically looking around, no adult in sight. She sits up straighter and squints, recognizing him as Agatha’s son upon closer examination.</p><p>She gets up from the chair, walking toward him slower than usual so as not to frighten him. “Hey,” she says gently. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>He looks up at her, eyes wide and watery. “Can’t…” He sucks in a shaky breath, thumb going to his mouth — a nervous habit that, if Rio had to guess, he hadn’t indulged in for years now. “Find my Mama.”</p><p>“Do you want help?”</p><p>“Mm,” he lets out a little whine around his thumb, cowering away. “Not supposed to talk to strangers.”</p><p>She puts a hand to her chest. “I’m Rio. I met your mom the other night, and I promise I just want to help you. Can you tell me where you last saw her?”</p><p>“There.” He points up the beach closer to the resort. There’s a large group gathered taking painting lessons, another doing a cocktail-making class. “I saw a seagull — he was my friend — so I ran after him.”</p><p>Rio nods as if this is perfectly understandable. “Let’s walk up together and try to find your mom. Is that okay?”</p><p>He looks at her, brows furrowing. “Are you going to kidnap me?” </p><p>“Nope. You can even lead the way."</p><p>He continues staring at her suspiciously. “You pinky swear you won’t kidnap me?”</p><p>Rio crouches down to his level, holding her finger out. “Pinky swear. I know things like this can be scary.”</p><p>He nods again, a fresh round of tears bubbling up in his eyes as he locks his finger around hers. “Want my mama,” he admits, the confession causing them to spill over onto his cheeks.</p><p>“We’ll find her,” she assures him. “Come on — let’s look.” She stands up straight again, holding her arm out in invitation. “Do you want to hold my hand?” </p><p>He wordlessly clutches onto it with his much smaller one. “I’m Nicky,” he tells her shyly. “Or Nicholas if Mama’s angry.” He frowns. “She probably will be since I ran off. She doesn’t like when I do that.”</p><p>“Nicky is a good name. And she may be a little upset, but I bet mostly she’s just scared, too. I’m sure she’ll be very relieved to have you back.”</p><p>“Yeah,” he agrees, wiping his tears with his free fist as they begin to walk. “Do you have another name, too? That your mama uses? A longer one?”</p><p>“Nope, I’m just Rio. My dad never called me anything else.”</p><p>“Oh.” Nicky nods. “I don’t have a dad. I have two moms, but they don’t like each other anymore.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio gives his hand a tiny, sympathetic squeeze. “That sounds sad. I have a dad, but I don't really have a mom. She didn’t like my dad. It’s no fun.”</p><p>“No,” he agrees. “You can share my mom with me if you want.”</p><p>Rio stifles a laugh. She certainly wouldn’t mind having Agatha as...something. A very different kind of mommy maybe. She chastises herself for entertaining the thought as soon as it pops into her head. “That’s very sweet of you.”</p><p>Because he’s opened the door like this, it’s harmless — she tells herself — to do the smallest bit of prying. Try as she might, she can’t resist asking about Agatha. Nicky is presumably one of the people who knows her best, after all, even if he was a child. “What’s your mom like?”</p><p>“She’s silly,” he says, which surprises her more than it maybe should. She did have a wicked wit to her, but she sort of assumed she might be the stricter type when it came to her kid. “She makes up funny songs and takes me to the playground when I’m not feeling yucky.”</p><p>Her heart melts a little at that. “She sounds like a very good mom. What about pets? Do you have any of those?”</p><p>“Yeah.” He perks up a bit at that, some anxiety temporarily fading away. “A bunny rabbit named Señor Scratchy.”</p><p>“Señor Scratchy, huh? Do you happen to know Spanish, or was that just the perfect name no matter what?”</p><p>“<em>Un poco</em>,” he says proudly. “I watch Dora even though the kids at school say it’s just for girls.”</p><p>“It’s not just for girls,” Rio assures him. “And do you want to know something about me?”</p><p>He nods, peering up at her curiously.</p><p>“<em>Hablo español</em>,” she says, speaking clearly and a bit slower than normal so Nicky can process it.</p><p>His eyes widen in wonder. “No waaay. That’s so cooool.”</p><p>She chuckles. “Do you have any words you really want to know?”</p><p>“Bunny! And pool. And ice cream.” He frowns a little. “I guess that last one is two words.”</p><p>“Well, bunny is <em>conejito</em>, pool is <em>piscina</em>, and ice cream is <em>helado</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Conejito, piscina, helado. Conejito, piscina, helado. Conejito, piscina, helado</em>,” he repeats in a sing-song voice. “I know all my colors already. I’ll prove it. What’s your favorite?”</p><p>Rio hums with a playful smile, thinking. “Green,” she decides. “Forest green.”</p><p>He gasps. “That’s my favorite! <em>Verde</em>! Mama’s favorite is purple <em>morado</em>, and Mom’s is red <em>rojo</em>.”</p><p>“Great job,” she praises. “Those are all very good colors. Do you know how to say that your favorite color is green in Spanish?”</p><p>“Mm…” He narrows his eyes in focus. “<em>Mi color…favorito…es…verde</em>?” he tries.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s right,” she encourages, her smile growing. “Good job.” She wonders briefly if her own kids would be like this. If they could. If something that was half of Thanos could possibly be so sweet. If her love for and from them — her hypothetical children — could make up for the lack of it for and from him. </p><p>Nicky mirrors her expression, clearly proud of himself. She sees his tiny shoulders drop, some tension leaving them. “Rio?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“What’s your favorite food? And your favorite animal?”</p><p>She taps her chin. “Well, I really like sweet potatoes, and my favorite animal…would probably have to be a cloud leopard. What about you?”</p><p>“Ice cream,” he replies easily. “And bunnies. <em>Helado y conejuto</em>,” he says, pride growing that he’d remembered.</p><p>“Nice job.” She smiles again. “What grade are you in?”</p><p>He holds up a single finger. “First. I have to miss it sometimes to go see the doctors, but Mommy and Mama say that I’m so smart it makes up for it.”</p><p>“Well, you seem very smart.” She nods. “Do you like school?”</p><p>“Sometimes.” He shrugs, his smile faltering a little as he looks down at the ground.</p><p>She cranes down to look at him. “Sometimes?” she gently presses.</p><p>He shrugs again, face flushing with embarrassment.</p><p>“It’s okay,” she soothes, deciding not to push further. She understood better than anyone not wanting people to pry about certain things — press delicate subjects. “Sometimes, school isn’t great, for whatever reason. I didn’t like high school,” she offers, hoping perhaps this may make him feel less alone.</p><p>“You didn’t?” He looks up at her again. “How come?” His voice grows quieter. “Were the other kids mean to you?”</p><p>Rio hesitates for a split second before pursing her lips and nodding. “Yeah. Sometimes, kids can be cruel. It sucks.”</p><p>“Did they call you names because they thought you were weird?”</p><p>“A few of them did. They made fun of how I looked and how my dad talked.”</p><p>Nicky looks genuinely confused. “But you’re so pretty.”</p><p>Rio breathes out a little laugh. “Thank you — that’s very kind. A lot of times, people are just afraid of things that are a little different, and there weren’t a lot of other kids who looked like me.” They’d moved from Puerto Rico to Pennsylvania when Rio was 12. She could count the number of non-white students at her small Catholic school on one hand. “There weren’t a lot of other parents who talked like my dad either. He had an accent and didn’t speak a lot of English, so they couldn’t always figure out what he was saying.”</p><p>“Oh.” Nicky frowns.</p><p>“Yeah. But I think I turned out pretty okay, even if it hurt.”</p><p>Nicky bites the inside of his cheek. “They make fun of me because I have two moms,” he quietly admits. “And because I have to use an inhaler and wear a vest that shakes my chest sometimes.”</p><p>“Well, neither of those things are bad. Families come in all shapes and sizes.” She lowers her voice a little. “Do you wanna know a secret?”</p><p>He nods seriously. “I won’t tell anyone,” he promises with a whisper.</p><p>“I have something called POTS. It’s an acronym for a long word, but basically, my nervous system is deregulated, so sometimes I’d black out at school or have really intense reactions to things. People could be mean about it, which made me feel sad for a long time, but finally, I learned that my illness doesn’t make me bad.”</p><p>He nods again — slowly this time, trying to process it. Rio hopes it helps. Her dad would tell her every day that her health didn’t define her, but it took a cashier at the grocery store of all people — one who happened to have POTS as well — for it to finally click. A stranger who actually knew what it was like.</p><p>“Did you fight back and not let them push you around?” Nicky asks. “Or were you the bigger person?”</p><p>“Sometimes, I’d push back. Eventually, I learned to let it go most of the time. It was hard to do that, but I learned that no matter what you do, some people just don’t understand and are never going to try to.”</p><p>“Mm,” he hums, conflicted. “Mama says I should stand up for myself. But Mom says I shouldn’t pay attention to them. It’s…confusing.”</p><p>“I think it’s just two different people having two different responses,” she tenderly reasons. “Both can be valid and useful.”</p><p>“Yeah, but they fight about it. A lot. They fight about everything.”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I can imagine that’s really rough.”</p><p>“Yeah.” His shoulders hunch a bit. “I don’t like it when they yell.”</p><p>“It can be really overwhelming,” she agrees, mind flickering to Thanos.</p><p>She snaps out of it when she finally spots who they're looking for talking to a resort employee. “Agatha!” she calls.</p><p>Agatha briefly glances over. It's clear she could not give less of a fuck about Rio at the moment. “Not now,” she snaps, turning back to the poor, terrified employee. Rio doesn't read lips or anything, but Agatha's not exactly being quiet. She's pretty sure she can make out the words 'woefully incompetent' and 'fucking moron.'</p><p>Rio sighs. “Agatha!” she repeats. “I found Nicky!”</p><p>Her head whips back over to Rio at that — and then down a little.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha says, over at them in an instant. She kneels down and wraps Nick in a crushing hug. “My baby. My baby.” She rocks him back and forth, back and forth. “I was so worried.” </p><p>Nick lets her do it — for a few moments at least. “Mama…” he eventually whines. “You’re squeezing me.” </p><p>“I don’t care,” she says, voice devoid of any sympathy. She sniffles as she pulls back just enough to look at him, hands on his arms. “Don’t ever scare Mama like that again.” His head dips in shame, and she puts a hand under his chin, tilting it back up. “Do you understand me?” </p><p>“Yes,” he says, voice small. “I’m sorry, Mama.” Agatha takes a deep, shaky breath before pulling him close once more.</p><p>Rio stands there, awkwardly watching. The selfless part of her wants to reassure Agatha he was really all right. The selfish part of her just doesn’t want to go back to where she’s sure Thanos is sitting by now. Doesn’t want to leave Agatha. </p><p>She lets them have their moment before she clears her throat. “If it helps any, he was safe on the beach. Nothing bad happened. I saw him, and we started looking for you — that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha, ever suspicious, pulls back to look at Nick — scans his body for injuries before meeting his eyes again to confirm whether this is true. </p><p>“Rio took care of me, Mama,” Nick promises. “And she taught me Spanish.” </p><p>Agatha quirks a brow at him. “Did she now?” </p><p>“<em>El helado, el conejuto, la piscina</em>,” he recites. </p><p>The corner of Agatha’s mouth curves into the smallest of smiles. She plants a kiss on his temple. “That’s very good, darling.”</p><p>She looks at Rio and clears her throat, preparing to say two words that didn’t come easy for her. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Of course.” Rio shrugs. “Maybe you can repay me by buying me a drink,” she ventures.</p><p>Her nonchalant demeanor falls back into place. “We’ll see.”</p><hr/><p>Sure enough, Thanos is sitting on Rio’s chair once she wanders back. “Where the hell have you been?” he asks by way of greeting. “The strawberry daiquiri I got you is almost completely melted.”</p><p>“I was helping a little boy find his mom.” Surely, he couldn’t be pissed at that, right?</p><p>Wrong. “Of course.” He rolls his eyes. “You and your bleeding heart.”</p><p>Rio resists the urge to roll her own. “Weren’t you just talking about being parental last night?”</p><p>“With our kids — our own flesh and blood — not some snot-nosed little brat we don’t even know.”</p><p>“I didn’t want anything bad happening to him.”</p><p>“Something bad could happen to <em>you</em>. God, Rio — are you that stupid? Do you not see the Facebook posts my mom shares? Human traffickers use kids to lure women into sex slavery all the time. Are you dumb enough to become a sex slave?”</p><p>She’s used to his bullshit, but fuck, this was a new level she hadn’t previously known existed. <em>You already treat me like one</em>, she narrowly resists the urge to say. Instead, she simply shakes her head. “I’m going for a walk.”</p><p>“You just went for a fucking walk.”</p><p>“Well, I’m going for another.” She turns back toward the resort.</p><p>He grabs her wrist — firm but not enough to bruise or draw attention from the other people on the beach. “Sit down, Rio,” he quietly growls. “Drink your drink and stop embarrassing me.”</p><p>Rio stiffens, a chill running through her. “No one is paying attention to us.” It’s true. The couples are still on their romantic walks. The kids are still building their castles out of sand. The teenage girls are still laughing at their phones. The world keeps spinning and spinning and spinning. Her vision is beginning to do the same.</p><p>“Sit. The fuck. Down,” he repeats.</p><p>Rio is frozen. She’s frozen except for her head, which she manages to shake — a weak, ‘No.’</p><p>“Rio,” he warns. “You’re going to make a scene.”</p><p>“I won’t if you just let go,” she promises, voice squeaking ever so slightly with panic. She fucking hates it. She fucking hates it so much. And she hates the next word more, “Please.”</p><p>“Are you going to walk away from me?”</p><p>“I just want to have a minute,” she desperately explains.</p><p>“You can have a minute with me — you can have all the minutes you fucking want with me — but you’re not going anywhere.”</p><p>“Please, let me go.” She attempts to pull her arm away. His grip only tightens — hand twisting her wrist the slightest bit. Rio winces, pulling harder out of instinct. “Thanos. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p>His hold gets tighter, too. “Then sit. Down.”</p><p>Rio whimpers under her breath, her increasingly blurry vision leaving her with no choice but to comply. She lowers herself into the chair, unable to meet his gaze.</p><p>He holds on for another moment before finally releasing her, handing her the daiquiri like nothing ever happened. “That wasn’t so hard now, was it?”</p><p>Rio grits her teeth but takes a sip of the drink anyway. Alcohol probably wasn’t the best idea at the moment, but she needed something cold — something to shock her system out of the nightmarish daze he’d put her in.</p><p>“I asked you a question.”</p><p>“What the hell do you want me to say?” His treatment of her wasn’t new, but her reaction was. She was never this bold — put up this much of a fight. </p><p>“It’s a simple yes or no — isn’t it easier when you remember your place instead of forcing me to put you in it?”</p><p>Rio glares at him over her glass. “I’m supposed to be your equal.”</p><p>He laughs, dark and hollow. “Whatever gave you that ridiculous notion?”</p><p>“I don’t know — maybe the fact we live in the 21st century?”</p><p>“The fact that society has gone woke doesn’t change that men are the stronger, dominant sex — the head of the households.”</p><p>“That’s not true,” she argues. “That’s a pigheaded belief from colonialism.”</p><p>“I told you last night, it’s so not sexy when you talk like that.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t care. I’m not just here to be sexy for you.”</p><p>“That’s exactly what you’re here for — exactly what you signed up to do when you <em>said</em> ‘I do.’ You’re my trophy wife. Your entire purpose is to look pretty on my arm. It’s the easiest job in the fucking world, and you still can’t manage to do it.” He shakes his head, downing his gin and tonic. “Fucking pathetic.”</p><p>She half flinches, the fight quickly draining from her. The fire evaporating into smoke — dissipating in defeat. “But you know I have a job I love,” she says softly. “You said that was okay, and now suddenly, it isn’t.”</p><p>“Hobbies. You were allowed to have hobbies as long as you put me first and understood how this worked. But you haven’t been, and it seems you’ve forgotten the terms.”</p><p>“You didn’t say that.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t have to say it!” he snaps. A few people look over at them. He lowers his voice back to a harsh whisper. “I shouldn’t have to fucking spell it out for you.”</p><p>She ducks her head. “You said you didn’t mind me working,” she quietly reminds him. “That’s verbatim.”</p><p>“Until we had kids," he clarifies. "Which I’ve been wanting to start trying to have for years now, but you’ve been dragging your feet.”</p><p>“You fuck me all the time,” she can’t resist pointing out — the last spark of snark. “It’s not my fault it’s not taking.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re still secretly on the pill,” he retorts. “Lying, sneaky bitch you are.”</p><p>Fuck, she’s exhausted. This was exhausting. “Why do you feel the need to call me that?”</p><p>“Because you feel the need to act like that. Everything I do is the result of your own actions, Rio.”</p><p>Rio hates the power those words have. Hates the way they sting. Hates the way she believes them, deep down. She wants to crawl out of her skin, but she settles for picking up her phone and mindlessly scrolling for a few minutes.</p><p>Thanos flags one of the cabana boys to bring him another gin and tonic. “Who are you talking to on that thing?”</p><p>“Nobody. I’m on Instagram.”</p><p>He grabs the phone from her hand, looking through himself. “Who the fuck is this?” he asks, turning the screen so she can see what he’s referencing — a man she seems to be following.</p><p>“That’s a film director.” She holds her hand out. “Who’s married,” she adds. “We’ve seen his stuff, at least some of it. He did <em>Hush</em>.”</p><p>“Oh, right. I hated that piece of trash,” he says, clicking the unfollow button and scrolling further. “And him?” He turns the screen again.</p><p>“I don’t follow him,” she points to the top of the screen. “It’s just the algorithm. Give me my phone, please,” she says as calmly as possible — as if reasoning with a child.</p><p>He snatches his arm back, holding it out of her reach. “Why would your algorithm be showing you other dudes? It's based on your searches and interests."</p><p>“Probably because I follow actors who have been in movies with him. I’m not attracted to him.” <em>Or most men</em>, she resists the urge to say.</p><p>“I don’t care if he’s an actor or a milkman or the fucking president — I don’t want you looking at pictures of other guys.”</p><p>She sighs, doing the only thing she can — relent. “Fine. I’ll scroll past those posts. Can I have my phone now?”</p><p>He considers. “If I find out you’re lying, I’ll break your phone and then your hand,” he warns before reluctantly handing it back.</p><p>Rio nods, a shiver traveling down her spine. She knows he means it.</p>

<p>Agatha ultimately decides on a purple sundress for drinks, the thin straps showing off her slightly burned shoulders. The sun exposure has brought out a few freckles as well, lightly dotting her cheeks and the bridge of her nose. She’s not usually big on hair or makeup — not since Nicky, anyway; no time — but she swipes some mascara onto her lashes and actually runs a brush through her hair before she leaves the hotel room.</p><p>After she sings Nicky his promised two songs, that is. And makes sure the iPad is set up in the corner of his room. She finally figured out how to get it to livestream onto an app installed on her phone so she could check in on him periodically. It took a lot of YouTube tutorials and cursing at an IT guy over the phone to figure it out. She’s pretty sure she made him cry. She doesn’t want to talk about it. Her struggle with technology, that is. Making him cry had been therapeutic and fun.</p><p>Agatha never feels underdressed — never feels inadequate period — but she feels a little twinge of something close to insecurity in her gut as Rio struts over in a green velvet slip dress. That — and a big stir of desire at her core. Fuck, she was hot. Has she always been this hot? </p><p>“Got all dressed up just for me, did you, hot stuff?”</p><p>That’s all it takes to make Rio’s newly tanned cheeks flush. “You don’t look too bad yourself,” she says, sliding into the barstool next to her.</p><p>“Oh, this? It’s just something I threw on,” she lies with a dismissive wave of her hand. She’d spent far too long picking it out. Which is to say, window shopping and then stealing it from one of the local ritzy boutiques.</p><p>“Mhm.” Rio nods, eyes raking over Agatha. She knows then that going through the trouble of shoplifting had been worth it. “I usually drink a negroni.”</p><p>She scoffs. “Are you under the impression that I’m your bartender?”</p><p>“No, but I’m under the impression you’ll buy the lady a drink.”</p><p>“Actually, the original deal was that you buy me one. If you’ll recall.”</p><p>Rio’s lips jut into an adorable little pout. “But I was your knight in shining armor today.”</p><p>Agatha lifts her chin a little. It was hard to argue with that. “Then I suppose we’re even. Which means we can each pay for our own — or we can stay for at least two rounds, both get one.”</p><p>“I’ll cover the first,” Rio replies, glancing down at the menu despite already knowing what she’s going to order. People seemed to struggle with that — looking Agatha in the eyes for too long. “What do you drink?”</p><p>“Wine. And not the cheap shit.”</p><p>“I would never,” Rio promises. “Not for a woman like you.”</p><p>“What do you mean by that?” she baits. “A woman like me?”</p><p>“Beautiful,” she answers easily. “Self-assured.”</p><p>Agatha raises her brows a bit, amused and marginally surprised at the forwardness. “True.”</p><p>Rio gives her a little smirk before ordering their drinks, choosing a very respectable red for Agatha. “How’s Nicky doing after that scare today?”</p><p>“Better than ever,” she deadpans. “It was ‘Ms. Rio this’ and ‘Ms. Rio that’ all afternoon.” Her worst nightmare had seemed to be a highlight of the trip for him so far. Little shit. He was lucky she loved him so much.</p><p>“Oh?” Rio laughs. “What did he say?”</p><p>“What <em>didn’t</em> he? He was very talkative. And more bilingual than usual.”</p><p>“He seemed excited that I was fluent in Spanish.”</p><p>“Yes, he’s…a curious one.” Agatha takes her wine from the bartender. “A nerd, really.”</p><p>“It’s sweet, though. It’s nice to see a kid who wants to learn. You’ve done a good job parenting — it’s clear he loves you.”</p><p>“He’s easy.” She throws back a long sip of her wine. Nobody had ever said that to her before — that she was doing a good job parenting. The last few years seemed to be all about pointing out how fucking terrible she was at it. At everything.</p><p>“Still,” Rio presses. “He’s a good kid. You must be doing something right.”</p><p>“He’s the best,” Agatha agrees. “Very intelligent. Very chatty. I just hope it doesn’t evolve into mouthy during his teenage years.”</p><p>“Who knows.” Rio shrugs, taking a sip of her negroni. “I don’t have kids, and I don’t want to with him, so I can’t really speak on that.”</p><p>Agatha cocks a brow. “‘With him’ — you don’t want to ‘with him.’”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio glances down, swirling the cocktail around in her glass. “He wants them with me. He wants…well, think classic conservative nuclear family.”</p><p>“I’d rather blow my brains out.”</p><p>Rio nods, pursing her lips. “So would I,” she softly admits before falling quiet. “You know…” she says after a long moment. “You know, I lied to myself for years that I liked him.” She shakes her head a little, breathing out a humorless laugh. “That I like men. Talking so frankly to you yesterday made something click about how fucked up it all is. How fucked up <em>he</em> is.”</p><p>“You’re welcome?” Agatha says slowly. “Or…congratulations on finally seeing the very obvious blinding light? I clocked him the minute I laid eyes on him.” She takes another sip.</p><p>“You may have,” Rio relents, still staring at her drink. “But he was kind when I first met him, and he got along with my dad. He was the easy answer — what I thought I was supposed to want. Marrying him was what I thought I was supposed to do, you know?”</p><p>Agatha did not know. Agatha never thought about what she was supposed to do — what other people thought she should — much less cared. Still, she senses that this is a rhetorical question and makes the rare decision to stay quiet.</p><p>“And it was…okay, for a while,” Rio continues. “Not exciting or fulfilling but okay.” She takes a breath. “But then he started telling me I couldn’t do certain things or associate with certain people. I’d try to talk to him — try to reason with him — but he’d either wear me down or make me feel guilty. Gaslight me into thinking I was doing something wrong — that the way he was treating me was my fault.” Clearly uncomfortable at the admission, she downs half her drink in one go.</p><p>“I…suppose I can understand that,” Agatha says, running her finger around the rim of her wine glass. “To a degree.” Things were good when she first met Wanda, too. It had never gotten to that point, but it had certainly gotten ugly.</p><p>“It sucks because I’m a lawyer. Like, I’m not stupid, you know? I never thought this would happen to me…” Rio chews on the inside of her cheek. “But it’s not really about how smart you are. And he’s not stupid either. Not about this. He knows how to get in my head. He knows how to twist my words. He never leaves bruises anywhere people would see unless you can easily make an excuse about it. He acts like he loves me, but really, he just loves fucking me no matter how much I say no.”</p><p>Jesus, Agatha was in over her head. Luckily, she was very good at pretending she wasn’t. </p><p>“You know that’s against the law, right?” Agatha asks. “Being a lawyer and all? My feeling on most laws is that they’re meant to be broken, but ones concerning…” She makes a few circles with her hand. “…that? Well, let’s just say that if I were you, I’d break a few laws of my own.” Which wasn’t saying much, of course — she’d broken a lot more laws for a whole lot less.</p><p>Rio squirms in her seat. “I just don’t know how to get…untrapped from him.”</p><p>“Sometimes, escaping a trap requires gnawing your own leg off,” Agatha says, finishing her wine in one last gulp. Another thing she’s learned about survival was that it was often an ugly, painful thing — sometimes uglier and more painful than death might be. Still, it was worth it. To Agatha, it was always worth it.</p><p>“I have to do it right,” Rio whispers. “If I don’t, I’m afraid he might kill me.”</p><p>“Not if you kill him first,” Agatha says, tone making it unclear how much she’s joking — if at all.</p><p>“Mm…” Rio hums, no more clarity in her own voice. “That could be self-defense, I suppose. Maybe righteous justice.”</p><p>Agatha flags the bartender down, motioning him to get them another round. “And presumably very satisfying."</p><p>“I’m not sure I’d feel satisfied. I’d probably just be…relieved.”</p><p>“Relief is still a hell of a lot better than misery, no?”</p><p>Rio tilts her head in tentative agreement, thinking. “The way he fucked me up, I’m not sure I'd have many prospects after.”</p><p>Agatha snorts, indulging in another scan of her body. “Oh pul-lease. Look at you.”</p><p>Rio looks up at her then. “What does that mean?” she coyly inquires.</p><p>She doesn’t take the bait — won’t make it that easy for her. “You know damn well what it means.”</p><p>“You could still humor me. Or…show me what you mean?” she ventures, taking a sip of her second negroni.</p><p>“Show you?” Agatha lifts her brows, pretends to ponder. “Well, that’s an interesting idea. Though I’m not sure you’re prepared for all that.”</p><p>“Don’t underestimate me. I can handle myself.”</p><p>“You sure about that?” she asks, testing the waters by gently running the top of her sandaled foot up Rio’s bare leg, watching her for any microreaction.</p><p>Rio bites her bottom lip, glancing around a little before taking Agatha’s hand and setting it on her thigh. “I’m sure. Are you sure <em>you</em> can handle <em>me</em>?”</p><p>“Easy, tiger,” Agatha says, moving her hand back down to settle on Rio’s knee — though she notably slides it under the hem of her dress. She leans forward, whispering in her ear. “But I’m absolutely positive I can handle you in ways you’ve never been handled before.”</p><p>Agatha sees the little hairs stand up on her neck. “I hope you can live up to all of these promises. I’m getting excited.”</p><p>“Mm, I’m sure you are.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah?” Rio asks, leaning back enough to look at her. “What exactly do you think is happening here?”</p><p>It’s a weird, almost awkward thing to ask — because it’s very fucking obvious what’s happening here. So obvious that it’s not even a cute, flirty question at this point. Maybe Rio got off on hearing her say it — ‘I’m going to fuck you. I’m going to give you your first orgasm. You’re not going to be able to speak or stand or breathe after, and you’re going to beg me to do it all over again.’ — but probably Rio is terrified. Probably Rio has never done anything like this. Probably Rio needs someone a lot more sensitive and sweet than Agatha, and probably she needs a lot of therapy instead of an affair.</p><p>But Agatha did not back down from a challenge, especially when the challenge was as intoxicating as Rio. It was going to be weird not approaching it with blunt force like she did with so many other things, but Agatha was nothing if not creative. If not adaptable and an excellent problem solver.</p><p>She licks her lips. Her thumb traces circles on Rio’s knee. “What do you want to happen, Rio?” she asks, voice uncharacteristically gentle.</p><p>Rio freezes, silent for a long time. “I’m not sure what the right answer is,” she finally admits, unsure and embarrassed.</p><p>“There is no right answer, angel,” Agatha assures her, uncharacteristically patient as well. “And there are no wrong ones either.”</p><p>Rio drops her gaze, staring at her lap. “I’m sorry. No one’s…ever really asked me that, and I…you…”</p><p>“Spit it out, darling.”</p><p>“You don’t make me feel like a piece of meat.”</p><p>Agatha sets her wine glass on the bar top in order to cup her cheek. “Look at me,” she beckons.</p><p>Rio slowly drags her eyes up to obey, panic glimmering in her pupils.</p><p>“You’re not a piece of meat,” she says firmly. “You’re one of the most beautiful fucking creatures I’ve ever laid eyes on.”</p><p>Rio swallows hard, brain seemingly on a desperate hunt for words. “You…flatter me,” is what she finally comes up with. God, she’s odd. Strangely pure and inherently dangerous all at once. It’s an addictive combination.</p><p>“I know. You’re blushing.” She strokes her cheek. “And trembling a bit.”</p><p>“No one’s ever been this…this way with me before.”</p><p>“Then they’re all idiots.”</p><p>“And you’re fucking amazing.”</p><p>“True,” she says simply — one hand still on her knee, the other on her face.</p><p>Rio cautiously leans into her touch. “You asked me what I want?” she whispers. “I want you.”</p><p>She brushes her thumb against her bottom lip. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes,” she manages, breathless.</p><p>She presses her thumb past Rio’s lip, grazing and parting her teeth the smallest bit — the action bold and testing. Rio lets out a little whine, eyes closing and mouth opening as she allows it in and begins to suck.</p><p>Agatha purses her lips, eyes dilating with desire. This was hot. This was extremely fucking hot.</p><p>After a moment, Rio opens her eyes again, looking at her as she lightly bites down.</p><p>A small moan escapes Agatha’s throat. “You have some fire in you after all.”</p><p>Rio pulls back. “I have plenty.”</p><p>She lets her hand fall as Rio moves away. She wouldn’t push. “Well, I like it.”</p><p>Rio smiles a little — bashful. “I like how bold you are. I assume it translates.”</p><p>“Oh, in every area, darling,” Agatha coolly confirms, taking a sip of her second glass.</p><p>“Tell me more,” Rio urges with a wholesome earnestness despite the decidedly unwholesome situation.</p><p>“Now what’s the fun in that?”</p><p>“To give me more to anticipate.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha shakes her head. “No, I keep my tricks firmly up my sleeves so the only way to enjoy them is to take my shirt off.”</p><p>Rio finishes most of her drink with almost comical speed, plopping the empty glass onto the table with a thump. “Then let’s go back to your room.”</p><p>Agatha sips her wine slow, amused. “Someone’s eager."</p><p>“Are you really going to make me wait?” she asks, almost petulant.</p><p>“Oh, you love it,” Agatha says, voice low in volume and register alike. She didn’t want to rush. She wanted to take her time with Rio — savor every second of her. She knows that’s what Rio wants deep down, too. “I can tell.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>“Tell me I’m wrong,” she challenges, swirling her wine once more.</p><p>Rio says nothing.</p><p>“You’ll have to be quiet,” Agatha warns. “Nicky’s a heavy sleeper, but still — he needs his rest, and I don’t want to risk waking him.”</p><p>“I can do that,” Rio promises with what Agatha thinks is almost insulting overconfidence.</p><p>“You say that now.”</p><p>“You can gag me if I get too loud,” she suggests, imbued with a sudden, flippant boldness. She was a Russian doll of surprises — a tough nut to smash.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll gag you regardless.”</p><p>“And tie me up?” Her voice makes it clear she’d be all too pleased for her to do just that. Who the actual fuck was this woman? </p><p>“Sure, with all the ropes I packed to come to this five-star resort.”</p><p>“Get creative.”</p><p>And who the actual fuck did she think she was? “You think you’re allowed to give orders?”</p><p>She shrugs. “I can try.”</p><p>“Mm, yes — that you certainly can."</p><p>Rio finishes the last swallow of her negroni, nails tapping the table impatiently.</p><p>“Didn’t even think to offer me a taste, hm?”</p><p>“You can taste me if you want,” she smoothly offers. “As an apology.”</p><p>“One thing you’ll come to learn about me is that I don’t choose.” Agatha hooks her foot around the leg of Rio’s barstool, pulling the chair close and leaning in so their faces are inches apart in a single, swift movement. She can feel Rio’s breaths, shallow and apprehensive and oh-so-needy. “I get everything I want,” she whispers before closing the short distance between them.</p><p>Rio tastes like gin and mint, and her dark lipstick clings to the chapstick on Agatha’s own lips. She gets a whiff of what is no doubt highly expensive perfume and suddenly regrets not shoplifting some of that as well, sure she smells primarily like sunscreen and resort shampoo.</p><p>Rio, however, doesn’t seem to mind, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s neck — wrapping a leg around her as well. It’s a risky move considering the short length of her dress, but Rio either isn’t cognizant of that or doesn’t seem to care. Agatha can’t honestly say she gives a fuck either.</p><p>She uses the opportunity to bring one hand to Rio’s ass, giving it a squeeze. She places the other on her lower back before gliding it up, up, up along her spine, finally landing to tangle in her hair.</p><p>Rio inadvertently opens her mouth as a small moan escapes her lips, and Agatha takes advantage of it, too, deftly sliding her tongue in. It’s very talented, her tongue, though that’s even more evident when it’s elsewhere.</p><p>Rio lets out another louder noise, starting to subtly grind against her.</p><p>“I’m starting to think you were lying about being able to keep the volume down,” Agatha accuses.</p><p>“I'm starting to think you were lying about being able to make me,” Rio tempts.</p><p>Agatha shifts the hand playing with her hair to cup the back of her head and yank it closer, deepening the kiss. Rio gasps into her mouth. Even through all the layers between them, Agatha can feel a damp patch starting to form as Rio grinds against her.</p><p>“Messy girl,” Agatha scolds. There’s wetness blooming between her own legs, too, but it’s easier to hide. “And to think I haven’t even touched you yet.”</p><p>Rio lets out a frustrated little sound. Agatha’s driving her up the walls — which is, of course, exactly what she set out to do. “You should.”</p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p>“Because I need you.”</p><p>“So it’s all about you, hm?”</p><p>A beat. “I’d like that,” Rio ventures. “At least for now.”</p><p>Her bashful straightforwardness touches Agatha somehow — touches her somewhere deep. Stirs something in her. “All right,” she says gently, sliding her hand down her arm to take her hand. She stands and lightly tugs her off the barstool. “Let’s go then.”</p>

<p>Agatha can’t help the small smirk the corner of her mouth curves into as she drags Rio to her room. “Those shoes aren’t very sensible, darling,” she tells her as she feels her attempt to carefully navigate the cobblestone with her heels — admittedly doing a halfway decent job keeping up.</p><p>“I know,” Rio admits. “But they’re my favorite, and I don’t get the chance to wear them much. Thanos doesn’t like them.”</p><p>There was something annoying about her bringing him up, but there was something sort of sexy about it, too. Illicit and deliciously dirty. “They’re nice,” she agrees. “Just quite impractical for the terrain. Do they hurt your feet?”</p><p>“A bit,” she confesses. “But they’re not terrible. I wear heels a lot. Lawyer, remember?”</p><p>“Right.” Without warning or stopping, Agatha gracefully lifts her off the ground, eliciting a surprised squeal from Rio that turns into a giggle. “Still wouldn’t want to risk a twisted ankle,” she says, carrying her bridal style. </p><p>Rio happily wraps her arms around Agatha’s neck, holding on more out of want than need. “Aren’t you a gentlewoman.”</p><p>“Only in the streets,” Agatha flippantly replies.</p><p>“So in the sheets, you’re…”</p><p>“What’s the opposite of gentle?”</p><p>“Perfect.” Rio grins. "Take me away, Your Highness.”</p><p>Agatha wrinkles her nose. “That name’s gonna need some work.”</p><p>“What would you like to be called then?”</p><p>Agatha has a long, long list, but she’s more curious to see what Rio will propose. That’s how you really learn about people — not by asking them about themselves but by having them talk about someone else. “Keep throwing out ideas. I want to see what your fancy lawyer brain comes up with."</p><p>“Making me work for it? Shame on you.” Rio rolls her ankle in the air, considering. “Well, you have the traditional ‘Mommy’ or ‘Mistress,’ of course. Then there’s ‘Daddy’ or ‘Sir’ if you prefer something more masculine.”</p><p>Agatha feels a flutter at her core.</p><p>“Let’s get one thing straight — I’m one-of-a-fucking-kind.” A beat. “That said, there’s nothing wrong with a classic, and the fact ‘Mommy’ is the first thing that popped into your filthy little head…well, perhaps we should indulge your instincts, hm?”</p><p>Rio purses her lips to suppress a smile. “Yes, Mommy." She squirms a little — or as much as she can in Agatha’s arms. "What am I, then?”</p><p>“A desperate slut?” Agatha guesses. “A needy whore?” She narrows her eyes. “Mm, no — the way you’re egging it on, you must be a cheeky little brat.”</p><p>“All of the above?” Rio proposes. “A girl likes to be a slutty little whore sometimes, too.”</p><p>“And evidently a greedy one if you want the whole trio.”</p><p>“Is that so bad?”</p><p>Agatha senses the slightest hint of sincerity in the inquiry. <em>Is this so bad? Am I so bad?</em> “No,” Agatha assures her — a bit more firmly than she normally would. “It’s not even a little bit bad. As I said, I get everything I want — I like a woman who’s hellbent on doing the same.”</p><p>The doubt seems to dissipate at that, Rio’s boldness returning. “And I like a woman who knows how to manhandle me.”</p><p>“You’re about as subtle as a sledgehammer, aren’t you, dear?"</p><p>“I’m autistic.”</p><p>This is unsurprising to Agatha. And unimportant. ”Is that the reason you’re horny as a bitch in heat, too?”</p><p>“No. That’s because I’m a bitch in heat.” She grins, teeth coyly grazing her bottom lip.</p><p>“Got it. Thank you for the distinction,” Agatha says as they get to her door. “Be a doll and grab the room key from my bra.”</p><p>Rio happily slips a hand down Agatha’s shirt, giving her tit a light squeeze before fishing out the key and handing it to her. It takes Agatha maybe three seconds to unlock it, but my god, it’s three seconds too long.</p><p>It’s evidently too long for Rio, too, as she begins to rub her thighs together as Agatha maneuvers the door open. “Need you,” she whispers in her ear.</p><p>“Huh-uh,” Agatha chastises at the action, tiptoeing through the common area to her room. “Patience.”</p><p>Rio pouts, continuing the motion as if daring Agatha to react.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t play games — she runs them. Creates them. “Okay.” She shrugs. “You want to take care of yourself down there, that’s fine — but then I better not hear you beg Mommy to do it for you.”</p><p>Rio caves immediately, growing still and looking at her with pleading, repentant eyes. Agatha is satisfied at the compliance, of course, but part of her hopes not everything will be quite so easy. She liked the fight. Liked the action of putting people in their place and the struggle of keeping them pinned there.</p><p>“That’s better,” Agatha says as she finally — finally — gets to her bedroom, promptly locking the door and tossing Rio on the bed before spreading the woman's legs and crawling between them. She puts a hand on either side of Rio's body, face hovering directly above hers. Her hair falls down in wavy curtains, lightly tickling the woman’s flushed cheeks.</p><p>Rio leans up in an attempt to kiss her, but Agatha immediately puts a stop to that, pressing on her arms. “Down, girl.” Then, when Rio whines, “You’re going to learn patience one way or another.”</p><p>“Not fair,” Rio pouts.</p><p>“Not fair?” Agatha scoffs. “How is it not fair? Come on — if you’re a lawyer, you better have evidence to back up such claims.”</p><p>“I want you. Now.”</p><p>“Not sure how well that’d hold up in court, hot stuff.”</p><p>“I don’t care,” Rio moans, frustratedly turning her head into the pillow. “This isn’t court.”</p><p>“Your skills can still translate, darling. Make your case and persuade me,” Agatha teases, her knee traveling further up her leg — close to her center.</p><p>“Well, you’re hot, and I haven’t had an orgasm in forever,” Rio tries.</p><p>“I think you just call that flattery, darling.” A beat. “Which luckily works wonders on me.” She lets go of her arms in order to tap her thigh. “Lift.”</p><p>Rio obediently raises her ass, back arching in the air. Agatha slides the thin straps of her dress off her shoulders before shimmying the whole thing down her body.</p><p>Rio smiles, though there’s something forced about it as Agatha exposes her — every freckle and scar and bruise. So many bruises littered all over in various stages of heal — a dark purple on her thigh, a sickly yellow on her rib. They’re…concerning. Disturbing, even. But it’s not like Agatha has the emotional intelligence to do anything about that. </p><p>So she doesn’t. Instead, she cups her hands on Rio’s breasts. “No bra? Naughty girl.”</p><p>Rio relaxes a bit at that — at her willingness to ignore it. “You saw the dress, Mommy. No room for one.”</p><p>Agatha gives her tits a squeeze. “Uh-huh.” </p><p>“You’re complaining?”</p><p>“No, no — that’s your thing, it seems. ‘But I want it now, Mommy,’” she says in what's clearly an over-exaggerated (though she thinks pretty impressive) imitation.</p><p>“I don’t sound like that,” Rio huffs. “And I’ve been good.”</p><p>“Our definitions of ‘good’ are evidently very different.” Agatha moves her hands down to her waist. “But lucky for you, I find ‘good’ extremely overrated.” She quickly replaces her palms with her mouth, tongue circling her nipple.</p><p>Rio whimpers, one hand going to grip Agatha’s shoulder. “Fuck!”</p><p>“Volume and <em>language</em>, dear,” she says, lightly biting down.</p><p>“I’m being quiet,” she hisses.</p><p>“Then I suppose we have different definitions of that, too,” Agatha quips, sucking faint marks on her chest — ones that would disappear by the time they were done. It was a pity, really. Agatha liked inflicting the kind of hickeys that lasted for days, but that’s not an option at the moment.</p><p>“Then fucking gag me like you threatened to.”</p><p>“More like you begged me to,” she corrects. “Your panties or mine?”</p><p>“Take your pick.”</p><p>“No, I want to hear you say it.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “Why?”</p><p>She stops tending to her breast to look up at her. “Because it’s fucking humiliating for you — having to choose whose underwear you’re going to choke on. Isn’t it, sweetheart?”</p><p>Rio’s face flushes at syrupy sweet degradation, shifting beneath her. “Yours, then,” she replies. “But if you gag me, you can’t expect me to answer any of your seemingly endless questions.”</p><p>“Your eyes will tell me everything I need to know. Blink hard three times if you need me to stop,” she says casually. Agatha was irresponsible at best, but wasn’t a fucking monster — she’d give her a safe word. Safe…action. </p><p>Agatha readjusts herself so she’s sitting back now, resting on her elbows. “But before that, take them off for me — slowly.”</p><p>Rio smirks. “Make me.”</p><p>She agilely snatches Rio’s ankle and yanks, sliding her across the duvet until the top of her is within reach. Once it is, she grabs her chin. Rio gasps a little, attempting to recover from the whiplash of the action, but her eyes are petulant as ever as they make contact with Agatha’s.</p><p>She presses her nails to Rio’s face, teasing the skin. “Mind your manners now, baby.”</p><p>“Maybe you should teach me some manners to mind.”</p><p>Agatha digs her nails in, stamping crescent moons into her cheeks. “Are you learning yet?”</p><p>Rio squirms but holds firm. “Spell it out.”</p><p>She lets go of her chin in order to land a slap to her face — sharp through relatively light. She immediately puts her hand to the cheek and makes intentional eye contact — a silent, ‘Is that okay?’</p><p>Rio blinks in surprise, almost seeming to buffer for a moment. After a beat, she gives Agatha a small nod.</p><p>With this permission, Agatha does it again — harder. “Spelled out enough for you yet?”</p><p>Rio lets out a little whine. “Yes, Mommy.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha lies back once again. “Now do as you’re told.”</p><p>Rio ducks her head down, beginning to kiss up Agatha’s thighs, getting closer and closer to her core. Agatha lets out a moan, chin tilting up toward the ceiling. There was something so deeply, scandalously hot about Rio diving under her skirt — her hidden little secret.</p><p>Rio takes her time — and thank fucking god for that — but eventually, she slides her underwear off of her legs and pops her head back up. Her hair is slightly mussed from the effort, something Agatha finds incredibly endearing.</p><p>“Now present them to me,” Agatha orders. “And tell me what you want me to do with them.”</p><p>“Gag me,” she requests as she holds them out, flustered again though valiantly attempting to pretend otherwise. “Please, Mommy."</p><p>Agatha curls her fingers. “Then come here.”</p><p>With a grin, Rio crawls — slinks, really — a few paces forward to hand them to her.</p><p>Agatha takes them. “Open.”</p><p>“Make me,” she dares once again. </p><p>Agatha unceremoniously pinches her nose closed, cocking a challenging brow. Rio glares, holding out for a few seconds before the lack of air becomes uncomfortable. As soon as she relents, Agatha shoves the underwear in — hard and deep enough to make Rio gag a bit — before unplugging her nostrils.</p><p>As Rio adjusts to the fabric’s texture, its bittersweet taste, Agatha nudges her so she’s lying back against the pillows again before swinging her legs over the bed, pushing herself up and going to the closet.</p><p>She rummages, grabbing the tie from her robe as well as a thin belt. She cocks her head, considering, before deciding the shoelaces from her sneakers would have to do to round things out. </p><p>She goes back over to the bed, taking one of Rio’s wrists and securing it to a bedpost with the robe rope. “You told me to tie you up and get creative. Are you regretting that yet?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head no, mustering up another eye-roll — a lot of bravado for someone currently sitting in a puddle of their own wetness.</p><p>“You will,” Agatha says, voice cool and confident and completely unconcerned. She pulls the knot tighter, leaving no wiggle room, before climbing over her to the other side and using the belt to do the same.</p><p>Once that’s done, she moves down to the end of the bed, yanking Rio’s legs — unsubtly pressed up against one another — apart. “What did I fucking say about squeezing these together?” She ties a shoelace around her ankle, fastening it to the bottom bedpost. It’s not ideal, but she only had so much to work with.</p><p>Rio watches all the while, keeping her limbs lax. Agatha hopes the lack of tension is a good sign. Despite the roughness of the scene, she is trying to be somewhat gentle for their first time. (<em>Their only time. Only time. Only time</em>, Agatha has to repeat to herself.)</p><p>She quickly does the other foot to match and kneels on the bed, looking down and admiring her handiwork, before glancing up at Rio’s face. “How are you feeling, baby?”</p><p>Rio nods, though she can’t help squirming against the restraints — and at the open air, cool from the air conditioning, hitting her drenched cunt.</p><p>Agatha grins, deciding to exploit that further. “Let’s see what’s under these, shall we?” she asks, hooking her fingers in the waistband of her panties — the thin fabric the only thing keeping her from being completely naked. She holds them there a moment, hands on her hips, building the anticipation.</p><p>Rio bucks her hips up impatiently.</p><p>“Hold still. Or I’ll find a way to tie your waist down, too,” she warns as she slowly slides her underwear down to her knees. Rio obeys as best she can, and Agatha rewards her by lightly running her fingers over her folds. “Oh, honey — you’re soaked.”</p><p>Rio nods, letting out a desperate moan.</p><p>“Aww, someone’s suddenly compliant.” She continues to gently circle the area, giving her the smallest taste. Rio instinctively arches at the light touch. She likely can’t help it, Agatha knows — but that’s not her problem. “Every time you move, I prolong this part,” she tells her, continuing to tease.</p><p>“Please, Mommy,” Rio pleads — something that sounds completely ridiculous around the gag. It’s music to Agatha’s ears. “Please.”</p><p>“Mm, no,” Agatha decides, continuing her too-gentle strokes and getting as close to her clit as possible without actually touching it. “Not until your eyes are leaking as much as your cunt. Until you’re a mess everywhere.”</p><p>Rio’s breaths shudder, on the verge of crying or cumming or both. Agatha hopes it’s both. </p><p>“You’re always so buttoned up, aren’t you?” she coos. “And yet you’re coming undone in my hand." She brushes the thumb of her free hand across her cheek. "Go on — let me see those pretty tears, pretty girl.”</p><p>It’s like she just needed the command — the permission. Rio’s eyes well from frustration as she clenches her palms, no doubt aching from hanging onto the edge for dear life.</p><p>“Oh, you poor thing.” Agatha catches her tear, swiping it away. With the other hand, she slowly slides the tip of her index finger into her pussy.</p><p>Rio lets out a muffled scream, nails digging deeper into her hand. Her eyes clench shut as she valiantly fights every effort to move her hips.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful like this, angel,” Agatha whispers. She feels Rio instinctively contracting around her fingertip and begins to slowly pump it in and out, in and out. “And so responsive.”</p><p>“More,” she begs.</p><p>She continues her unhurried, one-fingered rhythm. “You’ll take whatever I give you, and you’ll be grateful for it.” She forgoes two fingers or even three, shoving four in without warning. Rio accepts them easily, but it’s a rapid change in stimulation, and she wants the reaction.</p><p>Rio jolts against the sudden fullness before beginning to shake, her body seemingly at a loss for how to respond to such a sensation. She cries out around the soaked fabric in her mouth, the sound one of pain and so much pleasure she doesn’t know what to do with all of it.</p><p>“Shh,” she soothes, maneuvering the hand that was on her cheek down to her waist, gently pinning her. “Let go.” Of the ounce of control she was still clinging to. Of the emotions she had to hold in for Thanos. Of everything. “Let go. It's okay. I got you.”</p><p>It does the trick. She feels Rio palpably release as she goes slack beneath her, succumbing to the feeling — letting it crash over her like a wave. She cries out again, it tinged with a strange sort of relief. Though she’s physically tied to the bed, Agatha knows the emotional string holding her down — holding her back — has snapped. </p><p>She doesn’t stop the motion of her hand, though she does begin to place soft kisses on her cheeks. She occasionally pokes out her tongue to lick the tears away. They taste salty like the ocean just outside the door, though it felt worlds away at the moment. Everything but Rio did.</p><p>“You’re doing so good, baby,” she mutters between kisses. “Taking me so well. Being such a good girl.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio hums, dazed but delighted by the praise.</p><p>After a few more minutes of making Rio writhe around her fingers, Agatha glides them out, pulling the gag out as well. She gives her a moment to adjust to the sudden emptiness, flex her jaw, before filling her mouth up again with her dripping fingers. “Clean me off, won’t you, honey?”</p><p>Rio happily takes them, staring up at her as she sucks.</p><p>“How do you taste?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Sweet,” she breathes around her fingers. “Bitter.”</p><p>“Mind if I try?” The question is coy but sincere. She’d just fucked her rather intensely.</p><p>But Rio not only seems down for more but insistent upon it. “Please, Mommy,” she begs with a fervent nod. “Please.”</p><p>God, she was insatiable. Agatha can relate. More often than not, she was starving, too.</p><p>“Say ‘purple’ if you need me to stop — red is for self-righteous bitches.”</p><p>Agatha shifts down the bed, placing a hand on each of her inner thighs. She takes a few moments to simply rub and caress the smooth skin before digging her nails in, anchoring herself there as she ducks her head between her legs and begins to explore her folds with her tongue.</p><p>“Are you enjoying this?” Agatha asks, though she knows damn well she is. Every inhale of Rio’s is a gasp, every exhale a sigh.</p><p>“Magic,” Rio whimpers out.</p><p>She keeps licking for a few moments, enjoying the sound of Rio’s pants. But she wants more — she wants everything. She wants to give Rio more — wants to give Rio everything. She ups the intensity, beginning to suck and occasionally nip at her cunt.</p><p>“Mommy!” she yelps out.</p><p>“What, darling?” she asks, faux innocent.</p><p>She thinks Rio might ask her to slow down — to take it easier. But Rio rarely does what Agatha expects, which is a rare thing, too. Agatha was good at predicting people, after all. “Need you,” Rio breathes.</p><p>“You’re getting me, greedy girl.”</p><p>“Feels good,” she replies, words lazy and slurred from her headspace.</p><p>“You feel good? Prove it. Show me how good and cum for me.”</p><p>That’s all she needs — a little encouragement — and suddenly, she’s coming apart in Agatha’s hands once again.</p><p>Agatha helps her through her orgasm before removing her claws from Rio’s thighs, massaging the area instead as she laps up her climax. Rio trembles as she comes down, still struggling to get the proper amount of air into her lungs. </p><p>Agatha glances up from between her legs. “Do you want me to untie you now, dear?”</p><p>Rio nods, a fresh round of tears pooling in her eyes. “Please.” The poor thing is overwhelmed — that much is clear. Agatha tended to have that effect on people.</p><p>“Okay, baby,” she soothes. “Okay.” She kisses up her stomach and arms on the way to untie her wrists before doing the same down her torso and legs to unfasten her ankles.</p><p>Rio immediately turns on her side, still working hard to catch her breath. Agatha crawls up to lie beside her, a hand going to stroke her hair.</p><p>Normally, she would tell her to leave. Agatha wasn’t in the habit of letting people stick around — too intimate. Much more intimate than the sex itself. But there’s something about Rio that makes her mind that a little less for some reason.</p><p>Plus, she’s crying again. And not just silent tears this time either. No, these are heaving sobs — ones that wrack her whole body.</p><p>Normally, Agatha also enjoyed making people cry — women during sex, of course, but also incompetent nurses and obnoxious PTA moms and even children who dared to make fun of her son. But this was post-sex and Rio wasn’t a nurse nor a PTA mom and had made Nicky laugh and feel safe. </p><p>Agatha blinks, freaked the fuck out. She prided herself on being good at just about everything, but emotions? Those were her Achilles’ heel.</p><p>Rio seems just as surprised by this advancement — humiliated by it, too — though she’s unable to stop it. It’s clear she’s trying to get her shit together, to self-soothe by curling into herself. It’s also clear this is far from the first time she’s found herself in this position.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha curses under her breath, pulling her hand away from Rio’s hair in order to scrape it through her own as she sits up. “Fuck, fuck, fuck.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio mutters, wiping a hand across her face and starting to sit up. “I’ll leave.”</p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “Back to your husband? Looking like that and smelling like sex?”</p><p>“Well, where else am I supposed to go?” she asks, a pinch of bitterness to her tone.</p><p>“I don’t know — to the bar or the ocean or fucking Antarctica? Anywhere but there,” Agatha says, snapping back reflexively at the undercurrent of irritation in Rio's voice.</p><p>Rio moves to grab her dress from its puddle on the floor. “Sorry about this.”</p><p>“And stop fucking apologizing. It’s grating my last nerve.”</p><p>Rio freezes. And flinches. And seems to brace for impact.</p><p>Agatha freezes, too. She was usually unburdened by feelings of guilt or self-loathing, but there’s something unpleasant stirring in her stomach that she suspects might be in that ballpark. She doesn’t like it. Not one bit. </p><p>She stands from the bed, grabbing an oversized t-shirt from her closet. She almost tosses it at Rio but thinks better of it at the last minute, gingerly setting it next to her on the pillow instead.  </p><p>“Just...stay here for now,” Agatha says, voice softer but leaving no room for argument before she disappears into the connected bathroom.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha takes a moment to get her own shit together — peeing, splashing some water on her face, brushing her teeth — before filling a glass of water and dampening a washcloth. </p><p>“Here,” she says as she returns to the bedroom, finding Rio balled up on the bed. “Drink this,” she orders. </p><p>Thankfully, Rio doesn’t fight her, pushing herself up into a seated position. Agatha nearly begins cleaning her but ultimately decides against it. Lunging straight at her vagina while she was in this condition didn’t seem the smartest move. “Do you want to wash yourself up down there?” she offers instead.</p><p>Rio nods, taking the washcloth from her and wiping between her thighs before exchanging it for the glass. She takes a small sip. “Thanks,” she whispers, staring down at the liquid.</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms and bites the inside of her cheek, standing off to the side of the bed as she watches her. She’s still trembling like some kind of wounded animal. Which…she kind of is. Agatha saw the bruises. Agatha gave her more. And it wasn’t the same — Rio had let her, had asked her, had begged her — but it certainly made things more…complicated. Blurry. Messy.  </p><p>Agatha was addicted to mess, but fucking a woman in an abusive marriage with her son in the next room and the husband on the next floor might be the equivalent of an overdose. </p><p>“I’m not going to hit you, you know,” she finally says. She means for it to be comforting, but there’s a good chance it comes out crass. That happened a lot. “I’m not even going to touch you if you don’t want.”</p><p>Rio glances up. “I— Logically, I don’t think you will. I’m just used to…him. If I don’t make him feel good enough during sex, he gets angry, so I’m used to just dissociating through it. But I was…present with you. I felt…good with you.” She looks back down at her cup. “But then, I felt like I did something wrong. And now I’m not certain.”</p><p>“If I felt wronged by you, you’d be certain. I’d make it very clear. You wouldn’t be in my bed wearing my clothes, that’s for damn sure.”</p><p>Rio nods a little, finger toying with the rim of the glass.</p><p>Agatha taps her fingers against her arm, trying to figure out what the fuck to do. “I could turn the TV on,” she suggests. “Or open the window. Run a bath. Order room service.” She’s throwing out random shit, desperately hoping something sticks.</p><p>“C-can you just hold me?” Rio asks, voice barely a whisper. “And maybe run me a bath?” </p><p>She’s not sure she can oblige the first request — Agatha was allergic to cuddling — so she does what she does best and ignores it. “I’ll start the water,” she says, going to fill the tub.</p><p>Maybe it’s a shitty move to stay in there until the water fills up, but she doesn’t know how to be around Rio like this. She doesn’t do this — the after-sex thing, the gentle thing, the…feelings thing. Because she does have feelings. She just…has no idea what those feelings are. All she knows is that they’re foreign and don’t feel like they fit inside her body.</p><p>She stays in the bathroom until the last possible second — until the water is nearly overflowing out of the biggest tub she’s ever seen in her life. It was fucking humiliating, being this lost. Feeling this…inept.  </p><p>The last thing Agatha Harkness is is incompetent, and part of her resents Rio for reducing her to it. For getting under her skin like this. But the part that didn’t resent her — the part that wants to...protect? Her? — was larger and more powerful. </p><p>So she walks back into the bedroom yet again. She was in some fucked-up Groundhog Day, wasn’t she? A twisted, never-ending cycle? </p><p>“Bath’s ready,” she announces.</p><p>Rio nods, slowly crawling from the bed and stripping her shirt off before following Agatha in.</p><p>Agatha leans against the sink as she passes, awkwardly clearing her throat. “Do you want me to stay?” she feels herself offer. “Or get in with you?” she half-jokes.</p><p>Rio stares at her for a long, long second. “Get in,” she says. “And turn the lights off.”</p><p>Agatha definitely doesn’t think about the way the order sends yet another unfamiliar feeling through her body. Agatha was not submissive. Agatha was firmly in control — always. </p><p>She flicks the switch off, the overheard from the bedroom spilling in enough that she can still see. That, consequently, Rio can see her as she pulls her sundress over her head and lets it pool on the floor. Sees her fully naked for the first time. She walks over to the tub, slowly lowering herself into the water.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” Rio whispers before climbing in after her. Agatha hears her take her first deep breath in god knows how long as the woman hesitantly leans back against her. </p><p>She shifts as Rio initiates contact, spreading her legs to allow her to sit between them — Rio’s back to her front. Maybe it’s okay to hold her if she’s technically between her thighs, if she’s not facing her, if they were in a bath, if, if if. Agatha was good at excuses. At lying — even to herself. She lightly rubs the top of her hand over Rio’s arm.</p><p>She feels Rio’s body relax against her a bit at that — a relief considering how fucking tense she seemed — and runs her hand the opposite direction. She hears Rio take another deep breath, though it comes out shaky like she might start crying again.</p><p>“Shh,” Agatha urges, moving her hands to Rio’s shoulders and gently kneading them out. “I need you to calm down,” she tells her. For Rio’s sake. For her own.</p><p>“I’m trying,” she whispers. “It’s all just— I never feel safe anymore,” she admits. “I never feel safe, but I felt it for a second with you, and it’s all so— so exhausting to realize that I’m constantly terrified.” Her breath quivers again. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Rio.” She sighs at yet another apology.</p><p>Agatha can tell she wants to apologize again. Can feel her hold her breath as if that would stop the tears threatening to break free.</p><p>“Rio,” she repeats, more firmly this time. “Breathe.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head.</p><p>“I would rather you cry than suffocate in my bathtub. Or apologize again, for that matter. <em>Breathe</em>.”</p><p>That’s all it takes for Rio to start sobbing.</p><p>Agatha swallows hard, the display of emotion…uncomfortable at best. She was so fucking out of her depth with this. For lack of a better idea, she wordlessly cups a small pool of water in her hands, wetting Rio’s hair — sweaty and tangled — before squeezing some shampoo onto her palm and beginning to lather it in.</p><p>Rio leans into her touch, the sobs turning into sniffles and her body going from uncontrollable jerks to light shivers as Agatha works. As she threads her fingers through, deftly working out the knots. </p><p>“Did you mean what you said?” Agatha asks, well into conditioning at this point.</p><p>Rio sucks in a short breath, voice thick when she replies, “About what?”</p><p>“About feeling safe around me. Nobody’s…” She clears her throat. “Nobody’s ever said that to me before,” she says as casually as she can manage.</p><p>Rio gives a small, almost shy nod of confirmation.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“It— I—” She stops, trying to get herself more under control. “I don’t think you’d hurt me.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Agatha agrees. “Physically,” she clarifies. “Unless you…you know…want me to.”</p><p>“Please just don’t get in my head like he does,” she whispers.</p><p>“I’m not going to <em>try</em> to,” she says — something she has not even considered promising anyone before. “But I’m told I have a talent for it.”</p><p>That triggers something in Rio. She swivels her head around to face her, eyes wild with panic. “Please don’t. He messes with my mind. Makes me feel like I’m crazy. Like everything’s my fault — and I believe it half of the time. Please.”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha maneuvers her around by her shoulders so she’s facing her full-on. Some water lazily splashes out the side of the bath. “Look at me. Listen to me. Take. A deep. Breath. I do not want. You hyperventilating. In my tub. Okay?”</p><p>Rio whimpers, eyes squeezing shut. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” she repeats like a mantra.</p><p>“Rio,” she repeats for the millionth time, running a hand over her face. “Stop with the sorrys, for fuck’s sake.”</p><p>“I—” Rio stops, sucking in another sharp breath. “I feel like I have to. I don’t mean to annoy you.”</p><p>“Well, I’m telling you that you don’t.”</p><p>Rio nods, focusing on getting her breaths on track yet again before she opens her eyes. “Can you just hold me?”</p><p>Agatha rubs another hand over her face. This was a bad idea. This was a really bad fucking idea. This— </p><p>“All right. Yes. Fine. As long as you start breathing and stop apologizing.”</p><p>Agatha takes Rio’s silence as acceptance of their terms and turns her around once again so she’s facing forward, pulling her to her chest.</p><p>She desperately wishes she hadn’t left her phone in the bedroom. Desperately wishes she could put on some music, some background noise. Agatha didn’t like silence — was always tempted to fill it — but she finds herself, for one of the first times in her life, at a loss for words. For the right ones at least.</p><p>She needs something to do with her fucking hands, and she can’t very well wash Rio’s hair a second time. So she does the next best thing, reaching behind her to grab Nicky's brush from the counter and beginning to work her way through it. It seems to do the trick, Rio’s body relaxing against her. </p><p>Agatha’s not sure how long has passed before Rio speaks again, but it’s after she’s combed her hair smooth and started to twist a loose but rather intricate braid.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio says softly.</p><p>“Mhm,” she hums in response, continuing her task. “I worked a short stint as a salon receptionist. Picked up a few tricks.”</p><p>“I’m awful with my hair, much to Thanos’ dismay. It’s usually just down or half up.”</p><p>“Nicky likes to wear his long. You’d be surprised how much that offends people — how comfortable they feel to comment on it.”</p><p>“Which is asinine.” Rio shakes her head — as much as she can with Agatha’s hands in her hair, that is. “Gender roles are completely made up. He should do what makes him happy.”</p><p>“Yes, well, most people are very stupid and unhappy themselves."</p><p>“I know that firsthand. Thanos is that former; I’m the latter.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “Happiness isn’t meant for everyone. You have to find what you can manage to get out of life and go after that instead." That’s what Agatha’s done, after all. If she can’t have joy, she’ll take power. If she can’t have friends, she’ll take victims. If she can’t have love, she’ll take this — fucking someone’s wife at a luxury resort.</p><p>“I think everyone can be happy,” Rio disagrees. “It takes time, though.” Her gaze drops to the water. “I have to believe that.”</p><p>“Makes sense. You’re young. My ex was the same way.” The thought of Wanda pisses her off, and she accidentally tugs on Rio's hair a bit too hard.</p><p>Rio lets out a small whine. “Sorry.”</p><p>For once, Agatha doesn’t chastise her for the excessive apologizing. For once, she…actually feels like she should apologize herself. “Shit. No. That’s...that wasn’t in response to anything you said.” She continues braiding — being extra careful now.</p><p>There’s a beat of silence before Rio tentatively speaks up. “Bad ex?”</p><p>“Nicky’s other mother,” she says simply. “Self-righteous bitch.”</p><p>“Yikes.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a humorless laugh. “Yeah.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Agatha,” Rio says — voice soft and sincere. “That your marriage didn’t work out.”</p><p>“Sorry yours doesn’t seem to be either,” she instinctively retorts. It’s undeniably a dig, but there’s something genuine underneath it.</p><p>Rio shrugs a little, not particularly affronted. “I married him because it was convenient.”</p><p>“It doesn’t seem all that convenient.”</p><p>“It was straight out of law school. He was…nice. Until he wasn’t.” Rio sighs. “My dad loves him, and my mom isn’t around, so he really latched onto having someone else in the family. I can’t bring myself to tell him what’s become of it all. Even then, he’s not always bad. He can still be…loving. And giving. Before he turns again.”</p><p>“Then he’s not loving and giving — he’s a con artist.” She should know.</p><p>“I know that, logically,” Rio slowly confesses. “But it feels so…incongruent with my emotions.”</p><p>“He’s a piece of shit,” Agatha bluntly declares. “And so is your dad, for that matter, if he’s buddy-buddy with him.”</p><p>“Oh, he doesn’t know. If my dad ever knew, he’d kick his ass.”</p><p>“Well, in that case, you should tell him.”</p><p>“You don’t think he’d resent me for it?”</p><p>Agatha sighs, still weaving her hair. “I don’t know him, so I can’t say. But I’d want Nicky to tell me."</p><p>Rio considers this for a moment. “I suppose so,” she replies, not fully convinced. “Right now, I just want a quick way out.”</p><p>“Arsenic works pretty quickly.”</p><p>“Without becoming a felon,” Rio clarifies. “Even if it’s justified. The self-defense laws in cases of domestic violence are severely lacking because they don’t perceive or reckon with the emotional depth and complexity of abuse and intimate partner violence. If I used arsenic now, despite the ostensible threat to my wellbeing should he snap, I’d get hit with murder.”</p><p>Agatha promptly ignores all the legal jargon. “Not if you don’t get caught.”</p><p>“I’m not a straight white man, Agatha.”</p><p>“But you’re also not stupid. You’d just need a foolproof plan. And the guts.”</p><p>“How would you suggest murdering him then?” Rio presses. </p><p>Once again, Agatha can’t tell whether she’s genuinely entertaining it. The fact she’s not immediately and firmly writing it off as a joke, however, piques her curiosity. “Are you asking me to be your accomplice?”</p><p>“You’re the one who suggested it.”</p><p>“And you’re the one who seems to be taking it seriously,” Agatha counters. “Giving it some actual thought.”</p><p>“Autism, remember?” Rio deadpans.</p><p>“Okay, well are you autistic and legitimately considering homicide or…?”</p><p>Rio purses her lips. “Sort of,” she replies, noncommittal. “I’m sort of considering.”</p><p>“All right.” Agatha gives a nonchalant shrug. “Mull it over and get back to me.”</p><p>“How serious are you?” Rio asks.</p><p>“That’s not how this works, honey. I’m not answering that question until you do, so make sure you take some time to think about it and really mean whatever you tell me.”</p><p>Rio switches to chewing on the inside of her cheek. “How do I know you wouldn’t rat me out if I said I were serious?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “You think I’m a narc?”</p><p>“I never said that, but how would I know for sure?”</p><p>“I suppose you wouldn’t,” Agatha admits. “I suppose you’d just have to trust me.”</p><p>Rio glances back to look at her. “That’s a tall order for someone in my situation.”</p><p>“I’m sure it is. I probably wouldn’t if I were you.”</p><p>Rio faces forward again. “Well, that’s encouraging,” she says dryly.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry — would you prefer that I lie to you? Because I can do that. I’m very good at it.”</p><p>“No,” Rio says. “I prefer honesty.”</p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t trust me if I were you,” Agatha repeats. There’s a long, long beat as she finally ties off the braid. “But you do trust me. Don’t you?”</p><p>There’s another pause — maybe even longer this time — before Rio hesitantly nods.</p><p>Agatha runs her hand over the braid, admiring her handiwork. “We should get out. The water’s getting cold.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio says, voice suddenly quiet again. “Can I stay?”</p><p>“In the tub? I suppose so, but you’ll have to move so I can get out.”</p><p>“No, I— With you, I mean.”</p><p>“Like…in my bed?” Agatha clarifies. “To sleep? Until morning?”</p><p>Rio bites her lip. “Is that okay?”</p><p>Agatha considers. Then, before she can talk herself out of it, “Okay. But you need to be out before Nicky wakes up, and he’s an early riser.”</p><p>“I can do that.”</p><p>Agatha nudges her. “Then get off and dry off.”</p><p>Rio gets to sleep quickly, her slumber hard and deep as she curls up next to Agatha, braid fanned out behind her. </p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, hardly sleeps at all. She hasn’t shared a bed with anyone but Nicky or Wanda just to rest since…well, she’s not actually sure she’s ever done that. It’s odd but not altogether bad. </p><p>And that scares the shit out of her.</p>

<p>As promised, Rio sneaks out early — and so quietly Agatha, who eventually fell into some sort of slumber, doesn’t even stir. She leaves her phone number on the small notepad lying on the hotel desk along with her underwear — the evidence — before throwing her green dress back on and slipping into her room, waiting for Thanos in a chair by the bed.</p><p>He wakes up on the wrong side of it — literally and figuratively. Without Rio there, he’s rolled over to her space. Without Rio there, he’s evidently done that thing you weren’t supposed to do and went to sleep angry — very angry. The first words he says once he opens his eyes and sees her aren’t ‘Thank god you’re back’ or ‘Are you okay?’ or even ‘Good morning’ or ‘Hello’ — it’s, “Did you get fucking lost?”</p><p>Rio bites the inside of her cheek, trying to defuse the situation before it could get out of hand like it so often did. “No, I just had too much to drink and crashed on Agatha’s couch. I’m sorry I forgot to text.”</p><p>He sits up and turns so he’s facing her, their knees touching. “You’re <em>sorry</em>? You’re fucking <em>sorry</em>? I called you dozens of times.”</p><p>“My phone died.” She holds it up as evidence. “And I was drunk. I fell asleep as soon as she helped me back to her room.”</p><p>He grabs it from her hand and throws it against the wall. Rio hopes to god it hasn’t broken beyond a small crack or two. “Then you fucking charge it,” he growls. “Then you fucking tell her to help you back to your own room. We’re staying at the same fucking resort for Christ’s sake.”</p><p>“I was about to pass out!” Rio explains. “You know sometimes I have episodes where it’s hard to speak. It’s really not that big of a deal.”</p><p>“Always so fucking dramatic. Why did you get that drunk anyway, huh? I thought you were all about boundaries and limits,” he mocks.</p><p>She flinches. “I’m on vacation,” she defends. “I know how I handle alcohol. I was safe.”</p><p>“Safe? You let some random woman you’ve known for less than two days lure her to her room! Use your fucking head!”</p><p>It’s so fucking ironic that she would laugh if she wasn’t so scared. He’s uttered, ‘I’m not with you for your brain,’ more times than she can count. Rio rubs her face, standing from the chair. “You make it sound so insidious, and it’s not like that.” Not in the way he’s thinking, at least. “I’m here now, okay?”</p><p>Thanos grabs her wrist, yanking her down to the bed. “And you’re lucky for that. You could’ve been kidnapped. Or raped. Or killed. Is that what you fucking want, Rio?”</p><p>“Let go of me,” she hisses. “Now.”</p><p>“Answer my goddamn question.”</p><p>“What fucking question?” she snaps, struggling against him.</p><p>He squeezes her wrist harder — not difficult considering his strength and size. “Do you want to be kidnapped? Or raped? Or killed?” he asks, slow and menacing.</p><p>She’s not sure where the sudden rush of boldness comes from, but as soon as the words leave her mouth, she knows she’ll regret it. “You’ve already got the second one covered.”</p><p>In one swift motion, he’s above her, pinning her to the mattress by her wrists. “I’m getting really tired of the smart-ass mouth. And the lies. And the playing victim. You’re my fucking wife," he spits.</p><p>Rio whimpers, squeezing her eyes shut. “It’s true,” she presses despite most of her instincts telling her to give up and give in like she always did. But Agatha had awoken another instinct, powerful and long dormant, that tells her it doesn’t have to be like this. “When I say I don’t want it, you don’t care.”</p><p>“And when I say I <em> do </em> want it, you don’t care!" he counters. "I shouldn’t have to force my own wife to have sex with me! It’s emasculating. Humiliating. I wouldn’t have to take what’s mine so often if you’d stop being a little cocktease and <em> give </em> every once in a while.”</p><p>“I can’t have sex with you every day at your beck and call! I have my own life. I have my own needs.” She needs him off. She needs him gone. She needs…she needs…</p><p>She needs Agatha.</p><p>“My life is your life now, babe.” He digs his thumb into her forearm. “My needs are your needs.” </p><p>She whimpers. “You’re being too rough.”</p><p>He lowers his face closer to hers, a grin on his face and a glint in his eye. “Who are you fooling? We both know that’s how you like it.”</p><p>“That’s not how it works,” she argues, voice strangled as she continues fighting him to no avail. “Please stop,” she pleads. “Please.”</p><p>“If you want me to stop, then you better start cooperating.” He presses himself against her, already hard. “You have a lot of making up to do after staying out all night. You want to act like a whore, then I’ll treat you like one.”</p><p>This was happening. The realization that this was happening one way or another — with her permission or not — leaves her panicked and numbed all at once. She closes her eyes, the trapped tears burning them, but nods. “Okay,” she whispers. “Okay. What do you want me to do?”</p><p>He lets go of her wrists, sitting up and dropping his pajama pants. “Get to work.”</p><hr/><p>He doesn’t last long — he never lasts long — collapsing next to her on the bed once he’s satisfied. Once he sees himself on her face and makes her swallow him down. </p><p>She wants to burn off her tongue. She wants to throw up. She wants to empty herself out completely so there’s no trace of him, and then she wants to do it again just to be sure.</p><p>He reaches over, harshly patting her cheek. “See how much easier things are when you stop struggling?”</p><p>Rio thinks of the time she was four when she stuck her finger in an electric socket. Felt the shock flow through her body. It feels like that again, somehow. Searing pain all over.</p><p>Thanos pats her again — on the thigh this time — as he swings his legs over the bed. “Get up. I’m not wasting the day because you decided to get a fucking hangover.”</p><p>She stares up at the ceiling — at the fan spinning around and around and around. “What are we doing?” she hears herself ask, voice dull and flat and almost like it doesn’t belong to her.</p><p>He either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care. Probably both. “Breakfast. Wine tasting. And then massages — which I booked because I thought you would like it even though it sounds gay as fuck.”</p><p>“Okay. I’ll get dressed,” she promises, though she doesn’t move to get up. She can’t. Not yet.</p><p>He scoffs. “Not even a ‘thank you’? Ungrateful slut.”</p><p>She flinches a little. “Thanks,” she manages to force out before he can do more than just call her names.</p><p>“You could at least pretend like you mean it.”</p><p>“I do.” She even musters a tiny smile as proof as she pushes herself off the bed to put her phone — miraculously unscathed — on the charger and head to the bathroom.</p><p>“Don’t skimp on the overpriced makeup crap,” he orders. “You’re looking puffy from all the alcohol.”</p><p>She doesn’t say anything back. She doesn’t trust herself to. Isn’t positive that, if she opened her mouth, a sob or a scream wouldn’t come out instead. </p><p>She can barely fucking look at herself in the mirror. She hates the way he touches her body and therefore hates the body he touches. She approaches the matter of concealing the fresh bruises with an almost sterile, surgical precision before donning a halter-neck top and a pair of linen pants.</p><p>He, too, is dressed when she finally makes her way back out, opting for a blue polo and khaki shorts that, frankly, make him look like an idiot. “Took you long enough,” he says, looking up from his iPad. “Much better, though.”</p><p>Rio hums in response. “Let’s go to breakfast,” she says, picking up her phone and wallet.</p><p>“Why are you bringing those?” he snarks. “You don’t pay for anything or keep the phone charged.”</p><p>“Because my phone has battery now and my wallet has my ID,” she coolly replies as she leaves the room.</p><p>“Hate to break it to you, but nobody’s going to be carding you, babe,” he says, following her out. “You’re not in your twenties anymore.”</p><p>She sure wasn’t. She had wasted almost all of those with him. Nearly all of her thirties, too. If she thinks about it too hard, she’ll cry, so she makes sure she doesn’t. </p><p>She downs several mimosas at breakfast and several glasses of wine at the tasting. She has a pleasant more-than-buzz going on when she feels a buzz in her pocket, sliding her phone out to see a text from an unknown number she can only assume — and hope — is Agatha.</p><p>Her stomach, as well as the area right below her stomach, flutters a little at the two words, though she’s not quite sure what to make of them: <em> Save me. </em></p><p>Rio sends her three question marks in response.</p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:08pm]: <em> Nicky dragged me to some boring ass talk about marine biology and nature conservation. </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:08pm]: <em> Apparently, the whales are endangered and the water is filled with garbage and oil and the ice caps are melting.  </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:09pm]: <em> Big fucking whoop. </em> </p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:09pm]: <em> Anyway — hey, hot stuff. You left something in my room. </em></p><p>Rio suppresses a smile, grateful that Thanos seemed highly engaged in a conversation with another businessman that was almost certainly more boring and less important than the environment.</p><p>RIO VIDAL [1:10pm]: <em> I know. He couldn’t see the evidence. Plus, I thought you would enjoy it. </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:10pm]: <em> You thought I would enjoy doing your laundry? </em></p><p>RIO VIDAL [1:10pm]: <em> Having a souvenir. </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:10pm]: <em> Souvenir? </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:11pm]: <em> That makes me sound like a tourist. </em> </p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:11pm]: <em> Or a serial killer. </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:11pm]: <em> I’m not sure which is worse.  </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:11pm]: <em> Tourist, probably. </em></p><p>Rio bites her lip, considering how far to venture. She ultimately decides to go for it. Once you left your panties in a woman’s room, there was really no going back.</p><p>RIO VIDAL [1:14pm]: <em> Both are hot. At least with you in mind. </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:15pm]: <em> Makes sense. </em></p><p>RIO VIDAL [1:15pm]:<em> You’re sexy. What can I say? </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:16pm]: <em> Exactly what you’re saying now is perfect, darling. </em></p><p>RIO VIDAL [1:16pm]: <em> Is that so? What else do you want to hear? </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:16pm]: <em> Your moaning was rather nice last night. </em></p><p>Rio starts typing. Stops. Starts typing. Stops. It was sort of humiliating, knowing Agatha was seeing those three dots appear and disappear, appear and disappear.</p><p>She shouldn’t. She can’t. </p><p>But she does.</p><p>RIO VIDAL [1:21pm]: <em> That can be arranged. </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:22pm]: <em> 8:30. Hotel restaurant. You owe me dinner this time. </em></p><p>RIO VIDAL [1:22pm]: <em> I owe you? Well, you owe me the sex of my life after. </em></p><p>AGATHA HARKNESS [1:22pm]: 👍</p><p>A thumbs up. She gives her a thumbs fucking up when Rio asks her to rail her into oblivion. She is the worst. And Rio might be falling in love with her.</p><p>The thought makes her down another glass of wine.</p><p>Rio makes sure to follow Thanos’ long list of rules for the rest of the day. She holds his hand. She kisses his cheek. She thanks him as profusely and genuinely as she can manage for the massage. (The masseuse comments on the amount of tension in her shoulders three times. Mercifully, she makes no mention of the bruises.)</p><p>Rio breaks the news to him at exactly 8:24, after she’s showered and changed into a light green button-down dress. She hopes the fact that she’s been on her best behavior and that he’s relaxed from the massage will work in her favor. “My friend Agatha invited me out to dinner again,” she tells him.</p><p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa — is this the same bitch that kept you out all night?”</p><p>She gives him a small, apologetic smile as she puts the back of her earring on. “She knows where the room is now, just in case.”</p><p>“Just in case?” He scoffs.</p><p>“Yes, so I can make it back.”</p><p>“There’s not going to be a ‘just in case,’ Rio. You’re not going.”</p><p>Maybe it’s the alcohol she’s been steadily consuming all day, or maybe she’s drunk on the mere thought of seeing Agatha again, but Rio is not thinking clearly. It’s obvious she’s not because she does something so simple and so insane. </p><p>She looks him dead in the eye. She says, “Yes, I am.” And she ducks out of the room before he can reply.</p><p>He’s fuming. She knows he’s fuming. But she also knows the hallway is too crowded for him to take care of this the way he wants to without making a scene. </p><p>Still, he catches up to her easily. “You’re on thin fucking ice,” he warns in a low whisper.</p><p>Rio nods, continuing to stride toward the dining room. </p><p>“We’ll deal with this when you’re back,” he says — not a threat but a promise. “But first, I’m meeting her. You know why?”</p><p>Fuck it. The ice was going to crack one way or another. “I’m sure you’ll tell me,” she snarks.</p><p>He can’t deal with that comment the way he wants to at the moment either, but she has no doubt that he adds it to the ever-growing list of offenses he planned on addressing later — addressing without mercy. </p><p>“I don’t think it’s a ‘her’ at all,” he replies. “I think it’s another man. Are you fucking another man, Rio? Or maybe it’s more than one. That wouldn’t surprise me considering you’re such a cheap, filthy whore. Maybe you’re letting them take turns with you. Hell, maybe you’re letting them screw you at the same time. Am I right, Rio? I’m right, aren’t I. If I find out I’m right…”</p><p>For once, she lets his words wash over her — nothing but a fleeting, inconsequential wave in the ocean. She rolls her eyes. “My whole life doesn’t revolve around sex or men.” </p><p>“Don’t worry — you’ve made that obnoxiously clear with your incessant bitching and moaning and holding out on me.”</p><p>“Do you realize how insolent you sound?”</p><p>“Oh, that’s rich coming from you.”</p><p>Rio sighs. He was relentless. That’s what it always came down to. He was terrifying, but more than that, he was exhausting. “Can you just calm down?”</p><p>“Also rich. You hate it when I tell you to calm down. You’re such a fucking hypocrite it makes me sick.”</p><p>“If you don’t calm down, they’ll see the bruises and question you,” she says, attempting to appeal to his nonexistent reasoning skills.</p><p>“Not when you tell them you’re clumsy — a real stupid klutz who’s always hurting herself by accident. And who’s ‘they,’ huh? Nobody here gives a shit about you. Nobody anywhere gives a shit about you — except me. I’m all you have, Rio. I’m all you’ll ever have. The only one who will ever love you.”</p><p>That’s enough to make her stop. Enough to make her blood freeze in her veins. She thinks of Agatha’s words: ‘I’d want Nicky to tell me.’ “I’m going to tell my dad about what you do,” she threatens, voice more serious than it’s ever been.</p><p>Thanos is unfazed. “You’re threatening me with crying to daddy? Your dirt poor daddy who couldn’t even afford to pay your college tuition?”</p><p>Her blood turns to a boil. Because it was one thing to insult her, but bringing her father into things? “Shut up,” she hisses. Don’t talk about him like that.”</p><p>“What are you gonna do, hm?” Thanos asks. It’s weird having the roles reversed like this. While Rio was getting riled, Thanos’ voice was even — dangerously so. “What is he gonna do? Money is power, and I have a whole lot more of it than either of you. I can make people believe your bruises are from an accident. I can make people believe a lot of things are just an accident.”</p><p>Rio feels nauseous again. “Did you just threaten to kill me?”</p><p>Thanos looks at her — gaze ominous in how calm it is. How cold it is, too. “Now you’re just talking crazy. You should be thrown into the looney bin. Locked up. I’m sure that could be arranged, too — for your own safety, of course.”</p><p>“The world doesn’t work like that anymore,” she spits.</p><p>“My world does.” </p><p>And the scary thing is, he’s right. With the money he has now, the network of people he can access…</p><p>“That’s so fucked up,” is all Rio can manage, trying to keep the shakiness from her voice.</p><p>“Well, it’s the truth. If you don’t believe me, feel free to keep testing me and see what becomes of you.”</p><p>“I’m going to have dinner,” she announces before turning on her heel and beelining to Agatha’s table. She can feel Thanos trailing close behind.</p><p>“I respect the commitment to being fashionably late, dear,” Agatha starts, scanning her menu as Rio slides into her seat. “But I don’t like to be kept waiti—”</p><p>She glances up, removing her reading glasses. Her eyes travel from Rio to Thanos and back to Rio again. “Oh. You have company.”</p>

<p>Thanos helps himself to a nearby chair, pulling it to the side of the table between Agatha and Rio. He plops down into it like he owns the place — because, in his mind, he probably does — ignoring the odd looks from the occupied table he took it from. </p><p>“Don’t be rude, honey,” Thanos chastises Rio, reaching his hand under the table and placing it — rough and territorial — on her thigh. He sticks the other out to Agatha. “I’m Thanos. Rio’s husband.” </p><p>“Agatha,” she replies simply, taking his sweaty and fishlike palm. She shoots Rio a glance like, ‘How do you want me to play this?’ Deferring. Not something she does often. Not something she does ever. But this is a delicate situation, and she doesn’t want to make things worse for Rio. She…cares…about her.</p><p>“We’re having dinner, Thanos,” Rio says curtly. “I promise our conversation isn’t going to be very interesting to you. Why don’t you go on that boating trip you mentioned?”</p><p>“They only do boat rides during the day, and I want to get to know your friend.” He turns to Agatha. “She’s hardly told me anything about you,” he says like it's some biting dig. Agatha resists the urge to laugh in his hideous face. He picks up the menu and begins to peruse. “I’ll at least stay for a drink. What’s good?”</p><p>“Maybe all three of us can have dinner tomorrow,” Rio suggests, desperately attempting to divert his attention elsewhere — at least for the time being. “Besides, didn’t you promise the guy we met at wine tasting you’d grab a beer with him tonight?”</p><p>His fingers dig into her thigh under the table. Above it, however, he seems calm — to the untrained eye, at least. The untrained ear that couldn’t pick up the danger underlying it when he says, “What’s the rush, babe?” with a seemingly harmless laugh. “Trying to get rid of me?”</p><p>“That’s all right, Rio — you can tell him the truth,” Agatha steps in, turning to Thanos as if letting him in on a secret. “She’s trying to keep me from making a terrible first impression,” she says bashfully, adopting a persona akin to a mother in a 1950s sitcom.  </p><p>“I told this one that I’m positively <em>desperate</em> for some more girl time,” she continues, nodding over at Rio. “We had a hoot last night, and between my son and husband, it’s all testosterone in my house all the time. Even our rabbit is a boy — Señor Scratchy!” She throws her head back and laughs.  </p><p>She then grows more serious, leaning in closer and lowering her voice — even managing to conjure a slight blush into her cheeks. She really was an excellent performer — a talented liar. “And I’m a little embarrassed to admit it, but my marriage with my dear Ralph could use some…spicing up if you know what I mean. Rio went on and on last night about how <em>wonderful</em> her relationship with you is, and I was hoping she could give me some advice, lady to lady.”</p><p>Thanos narrows his eyes, a little skeptical — but only a little. Agatha was very convincing, and he was very stupid. “You didn’t have time to cover that last night? She was out until morning.” </p><p>“Oh.” Agatha covers her face, faking embarrassment. “I am <em>so</em> sorry about that. I was having so much fun that I just didn’t want the night to end. I kept ordering more and more drinks, and Rio was too polite to decline. Naughty of me, I know! But I assure you it <em>will not</em> happen again.”</p><p>“See?” Rio says with a grateful smile. “It’ll be fine. You should go enjoy yourself.”</p><p>Thanos looks between them. “You’ll make sure she’s back at a reasonable hour this time?” </p><p>“Of <em>course</em>,” Agatha promises, putting a hand on her chest. Cross her heart and hope he fucking dies. “Yes, sir.” </p><p>There’s another beat before he somewhat reluctantly stands up. “All right. I’ll see you later.” He gives Rio a look, a subtle warning, before turning to Agatha. “Nice to meet you.” </p><p>“The pleasure is all mine,” Agatha assures him, plastering on a huge grin as he walks away.</p><p>After he’s out of eye- and earshot, it immediately falls. She rolls her eyes, putting her reading glasses on again — seamlessly snapping back into herself. “Dumb fuck,” she mutters, picking up her menu. “What are you getting to drink?” she casually asks.</p><p>“God, anything that’ll help me forget that I live with that. Double vodka on the rocks, maybe.”</p><p>“Easy, tiger — I met you two days ago and already know you’re a lightweight.”</p><p>Rio scoffs. “I’m not that much of a lightweight. Plus, after my day, I need it.”</p><p>“Texting me was so terrible it’s driven you to the bottle?”</p><p>“No, that was the highlight of the day. Him forcing me to suck him off is what’s driving that.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand balls into a subtle fist under the table. She would love nothing more than to slam Thanos’ head into the stupid fucking chair he swiped, but she could not get too involved. Not in this. Not with Rio. “Has that moved the needle at all on what we discussed last night?”</p><p>“A bit, yes. Though I’m a little afraid he might beat me to the punch.”</p><p>“That’s why you’d hypothetically want to act fast.”</p><p>“Hypothetically, I’m seriously considering it.”</p><p>“Well, we probably shouldn’t talk business around all these witnesses, darling,” Agatha cautions. She was a criminal but not a careless one. “Best to stick to pleasure right now.”</p><p>Rio raises a brow. “Is that so.”</p><p>“Unless you’d like to talk about the weather or, god forbid, a sports team,” Agatha says dryly as a lanky waiter with curly brown hair finally approaches their table.</p><p>“Good evening. My name’s Bil—”</p><p>“Took you long enough,” Agatha cuts him off before he can get through his spiel. Why everyone thought she gave a shit about their name was a mystery to her. “Two vodkas — doubles — on the rocks.”</p><p>Rio gives the waiter a small look of thanks before turning back to Agatha. “Pleasure is perfectly fine with me.”</p><p>“All right.” Agatha nods. Then, without missing a beat, “What color underwear do you plan on leaving in my room tonight?”</p><p>Rio adorably chokes on her water, though she recovers impressively quickly. “Well, I’m not currently wearing any, so…”</p><p>“Pity.” Agatha sips her own water. “The pair I have might get lonely.”</p><p>“We have a few nights left — a few more chances for you to amass a collection.”</p><p>“Not nearly enough.” Ew. What the fuck. She sounds desperate. And Agatha Harkness is not <em>desperate</em>.</p><p>“Who says this has to be the end of it?” Rio asks with a mischievous little smile.</p><p>Agatha gives her one in return, though hers is bittersweet and uncharacteristically gentle. “This isn’t real life. We both know that.”</p><p>“We could make it real life,” she suggests before raising her palms. “Just seeing each other casually. Nothing fancy.”</p><p>Agatha likes the thought of it, but Agatha likes the thought of a lot of things. Thoughts were just that — ideas, dreams, fantasies. Thoughts weren’t practical or tangible, and even when you managed to make them a reality, they rarely lived up to what you’d hoped. Were rarely worth plucking from your head at all. </p><p>“It’s already complicated enough here, Rio. In paradise. Without the stress of jobs or doctors’ appointments or traveling. I mean, where do you even live?”</p><p>“I’ll be moving after I’m done with him, so I don’t know.” She shrugs. Agatha can sense the smallest bit of stubbornness in the motion.</p><p>Agatha immediately grabs the vodka as soon as the server sets it on the table and downs half of it in one large gulp. She gives him a dirty look as he keeps standing there, his pen poised above his pad to take their orders. “A minute, please?” Agatha snaps at him. He blushes and scurries away. </p><p>She finishes the rest of her drink, sighing as she looks at Rio. “Are you sure you’re really done with him?” she asks, lowering her voice. “Because women say that to me all the time — that they’re going to leave their husbands. They rarely do. The only one who did was…” She trails off, pursing her lips. <em>Was Wanda.</em></p><p>Rio stares at her own vodka for a moment before she downs it just as quickly as Agatha had. “He raped me this morning. Gave me new bruises. Threatened to kill me or have me committed. That’s too far, even for the part of me that still thinks it’s all my fault.”</p><p>Her hand balls up again, her jaw clenching. She wants him to rot in a place worse than hell, and she wants to protect Rio, but she wants to protect herself more. And she needs to protect Nicky most of all. </p><p>“But there is still a part of you,” Agatha counters. “And that part of you has won out for…how many years have you been with him?”</p><p>“That part hasn’t necessarily won out,” Rio argues. “Compulsive heterosexuality plus my frequent dissociation has. But when I met you, despite how rude you were, you were so blunt that it just sort of…hit me. What the reality of it all was.”</p><p>Agatha shifts uncomfortably in her seat. Agatha loves to be adored. She loves to be the mastermind. She loves to be in control. But she does not love to be in charge. It’s a frequently confused and blurred distinction, but it’s different — it couldn’t be more different. Save for Nicky, Agatha is committed to no one but herself. Depended on no one but herself and had no one depend on her. </p><p>“This isn’t a fairytale, Rio. I’m not a knight in shining armor riding in on a horse coming to rescue you from the beast or ogre or however the fuck the analogy would go.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio says. “I don’t want that. I know well and good I have shit to sort out, but it just so happens the way you phrased something resonated with me, regardless of…” She gestures between the two of them. “…this. Us.” She tucks a piece of hair behind her ear. “When I suggested seeing you, it was under no pretense of rescue. I know, in the end, no one is coming to save me.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha replies simply — maybe a little shortly. “Because they’re not.” She looks down at the menu again. “I’m getting a steak,” she announces.</p><p>“I’m getting the parmesan chicken. He loves to control what I eat — always tells me to watch my figure — and maybe it sounds stupid, but this feels like the first step of breaking away from that, you know? Going against his wishes and indulging in something I want just for me. In feeling free.” She pauses, embarrassed. “Sorry. I’m rambling. It’s just been a while since anyone’s wanted to listen.”</p><p>“Who said I wanted to listen?” It's instinct. A defense mechanism. The more terrified Agatha is, the bitchier she becomes. But she doesn’t know how to change it. Doesn’t know how to stop.</p><p>Rio flinches, eyes dropping down to the menu. “Sorry,” she says softly.</p><p>She gives her a look. The constant apologies were enough to drive her crazy. “Let’s not start all <em>that</em> back up again.”</p><p>Rio gives her a little nod, face flushing red. Maybe it’s just the reflection of the candle, but Agatha thinks she can see her eyes get glassy with unshed tears.</p><p>Fuck. <em>Fuck</em>. She’s traumatized the woman. Usually, Agatha loves doing that — takes pride in that — but Rio…well, it sort of felt like kicking a dog who was down. She doesn’t open her mouth. She’s not sure what would come out of it. That happens a lot, her saying shit without thinking. Where’s the fucking waiter when you needed him? </p><p>“Did you know that one blue whale can weigh as much as 24 elephants?” Agatha finds herself blurting to fill the silence — a stupid ocean fact she learned during that dreadful lecture with Nicky.</p><p>Rio purses her lips, gives her another tiny nod. </p><p>Agatha clears her throat a little, continuing to look at the menu despite knowing — and announcing — what she was going to get. “You probably knew that already. Nicky did.”</p><p>Rio hesitantly peers up. “I don’t know a lot about whales, actually,” Rio says, voice quiet and careful as if she’s afraid that one wrong word would make Agatha bite her head off. Agatha can’t exactly blame her. “I’m better versed in sharks.”</p><p>Considering her husband, Agatha’s sure she is. She somehow smartly avoids commenting on this — the shark-infested waters. “They don’t have bones. And their skin feels like sandpaper,” she continues, going to take a swig of her vodka and realizing she’s out. Goddamn it. “Or so I’ve heard.”</p><p>“Sharks? Yeah. They also have electroreceptors on their foreheads, which—” Rio abruptly stops herself, looking down again and sipping her water. </p><p>She raises a brow. “Which what?” she prompts. “Don’t keep me hanging, hot stuff.”</p><p>“Which allows them to sense the electromagnetic fields of other creatures,” Rio finishes, chewing on the inside of her cheek for a moment. “Are you playing mental games with me?”</p><p>”Pardon?”</p><p>“You acted like you didn’t want to listen, and now you’re having me ramble about sharks. I’m…confused.”</p><p>Agatha sure as fuck is, too. About Rio. About herself. About everything. “Not intentionally.” <em>For once.</em></p><p>Rio furrows her brows. “So?”</p><p>“So...what?”</p><p>“You want to listen to me?”</p><p>A beat. “I just don’t like people assuming what I want.” Agatha looks down at her lap, smoothing the napkin on it.</p><p>“And that’s…fair, but you didn’t answer my question.”</p><p>Another beat. “Yes. I want to listen.”</p><p>“Okayyy,” she says slowly before letting yet another excruciating few seconds of silence overtake them. “I just don’t want to bother you.”</p><p>“I’d get up and leave if you were bothering me. I’d have no problem doing that.”</p><p>Rio nods a little, movement just as slow as her previous words.</p><p>The waiter comes back then, which Agatha is supremely grateful for despite the fact the boy seems supremely stupid. “Another round for both of us. A filet mignon for me, medium rare. And upgrade those mashed potatoes to truffle fries,” she says, handing him the menu without looking at him. Sharon Davis, her latest credit card fraud victim, was buying, after all.</p><p>“Um…” Rio clears her throat nervously. “House salad. Dressing on the side. Thanks,” she says, giving him her menu as well.</p><p>“What happened to the chicken parm?” Agatha asks as the waiter begins to walk away.</p><p>“I got too…anxious to order it,” Rio says, shaking her head in embarrassment. “It’s stupid, I know.”</p><p>“Why does chicken make you anxious?”</p><p>“It’s not the chicken — it’s everything else on it. The, um…calories. The fat. You know.”</p><p>Agatha gives her a look. “Fuck that.” She turns around and snaps her fingers. “Benny!” she calls. </p><p>Their waiter turns around, eyes wide and terrified as he slowly approaches their table again. “Billy?” he corrects — it sounding more like a question. </p><p>“Whatever. Add a chicken parm.” </p><p>“Do you…want that…instead of the steak or—”</p><p>“In addition. In addition to the steak. How fucking hard is that?” </p><p>Billy nods frantically. “I’ll put it in right away.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head as he walks away, pursing her lips to hide a smile. “You’re crazy."</p><p>“So I've been told."</p><p>“Well, I hope you know I mean it as a compliment. I can be loud and commanding when I need to, but that’s usually at work. Otherwise, it’s been beaten out of me.” </p><p>Agatha knows how literally Rio probably means that. She knows because she’s experienced it herself. Not that she's about to air out her mommy issues at the dinner table. She'd rather gouge her eye out with the steak knife.</p><p>“People have certainly tried,” Agatha says with a flippant wave of her hand. “Turns out I’m unbeatable.”</p><p>“Which is admirable. Like I said, I’m one hell of a lawyer, but it’s been a while since I’ve felt powerful outside of the courtroom.”</p><p>There’s a long, long moment of silence as Agatha contemplates. She was a fucking control freak, which is why she doesn’t usually do this. She was a fucking control freak, which is why it felt exhilarating to occasionally do this. </p><p>And then there was that split-second moment of authority — of command — in Rio’s voice last night that sent a pleasant heat through her core. </p><p>“How would you feel about experimenting with having power in the bedroom then?” she asks.</p><p>Rio chews on the inside of her cheek, taken aback by the suggestion. “I— I don’t know. Maybe?” She thinks for a moment longer before deciding, “I think I’d be open to trying it once I know you a bit better.”</p><p>She shrugs. “It might be good for you is all — help you find your voice, your confidence.”</p><p>“I’d be willing to give it a shot. I just want to know you better before I let myself possibly look incredibly stupid.” She breathes out a laugh.</p><p>“What is it, exactly, that you’re dying to know?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Anything, really. I just want to learn more about the enigmatic Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“Well, that spoils the mystery, doesn’t it?” Agatha challenges. “I tell you all my secrets, then I'll no longer be an enigma."</p><p>“I have a feeling I’ll like the woman underneath the enigma, too.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. That certainly hadn’t been her experience. She was an acquired flavor, and most people had terrible taste. “First time for everything, I suppose.”</p><p>“Well, go ahead,” Rio urges. “Tell me something about yourself. Whatever you want to say.”</p><p>She doesn’t know. For the first time in Agatha Harkness’ life, she’s speechless. Lying to Rio felt oddly cruel, but the truth was simply too awful. Too depressing.</p><p>Rio tilts her head at the uncharacteristic silence. “It doesn’t have to be anything special,” she assures her. “I just want to know you.”</p><p>She stirs her water around in her glass. “Nicky has a wonderful voice. He learned to sing before he learned to speak.” It’s cheating, really — giving her information about her son instead of her. Agatha did that a lot.</p><p>Thankfully, Rio doesn’t seem to notice. Or at least doesn’t seem to mind. Her mouth curves into a soft smile. “That’s sweet. What kind of music does he like best?”</p><p>“None of that inane kiddy crap, that’s for damn sure.” Agatha scoffs. That shit drove her nuts. “I make sure he’s exposed to real music."</p><p>Rio breathes out a laugh. “Fair enough. What kind of music do <em>you</em> like then?”</p><p>Oh, she was good — redirecting the conversation back to her. Asking a leading question. She really was a lawyer.</p><p>“I grew up in the ‘80s, so a lot of Joan Jett, Stevie Nicks, Pat Benatar,” Agatha replies. “Anything my mother hated, really.” She started listening to them because it pissed Evanora off, made her clutch her pearls. She kept listening to them because it resonated with her — sounds of anger. And of longing, too, for something else.</p><p>“Stevie Nicks is great.” Rio nods. “I also really love Gloria Estefan.”</p><p>Good taste. “Did your father introduce you to her?”</p><p>“Yeah, but I also listened to her on the radio. I’m an early '90s kid — she was still popular then.”</p><p>“Right. She would’ve been,” she agrees.  </p><p>The waiter is taking approximately eight thousand fucking years to bring them another round of drinks — so much for five-star service — so she fishes around in her purse for a cigarette.</p><p>Rio watches her all the while, taking a sip of her drink. She still had some. Lucky bitch. “You really are beautiful, you know,” she observes.</p><p>“Well aware.” Agatha flicks a lighter on, holding the cigarette to it. “But that’s kind of you, nonetheless.”</p><p>“I was just noticing,” Rio muses, her gaze somehow intense and vaguely dreamlike. “Your jawline is so nice, and your hair is so perfect.”</p><p>“I’m not actually sure I own a brush for myself. I used Nicky's to do mine yesterday. And yours last night,” Agatha admits, taking a long drag. The nicotine makes her brain feel pleasantly fuzzy. After she blows it out, she reaches across the table, offering it to Rio.</p><p>Rio plucks it from her fingers, inhaling as well. “Well, your hair is perfect. And the way you did mine was, too.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “Like I said, I’ve had practice.”  </p><p>Their waiter — Billy, was it? — picks now to approach the table. “Excuse me, but you can’t be smoking here.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to tell him off, but Rio surprisingly beats her to the punch. “Other guests are.” She nods to a few businessmen a couple of tables away. “Why are we the only ones you’re policing?”</p><p>“They’re not in my section,” he says apologetically. </p><p>“For fuck’s sake — we’re outdoors,” Agatha points out. “In <em>Sicily</em>.”</p><p>“And I’ve read your policies,” Rio adds. “None of them say you can’t smoke outside.”</p><p>The waiter anxiously bites his lip. “It’s only my first week—“</p><p>“That much was evident,” Agatha cuts in. </p><p>“—and my boss was really, really strict about it during training.”</p><p>“Is your boss out here?” Agatha interrogates. “Or are you planning on being a little narc?”</p><p>“She’s in the back. Watching me like a hawk,” Billy says, growing more panicked. He’s still focused on Rio, no doubt because she seemed the nicer, more understanding of the two.</p><p>“If she comes out here, I’ll tell her what I told you,” Rio assures him, voice kind but firm.</p><p>The stupid kid bites his lip. “Please. I really need this job,” he begs, on the verge of bursting into tears.</p><p>“Can you get your manager?” Rio asks, tone softening. “I’d like to have a word with her.”</p><p>“If I cause problems already and show her I can’t enforce the rules, she’s going to fire me.”</p><p>“Sounds like a you problem,” Agatha replies, unsympathetic.</p><p>Billy looks like he's on the urge of combusting, desperately racking his brain for a solution. It makes him look sort of constipated. Not exactly the view you want at the dinner table. “If you put it out, I’ll give you free dessert!” he desperately blurts. </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, considering. “I’m listening.”</p><p>“I’ll tell them it’s your birthday or…or anniversary or something!” </p><p>Anniversary. The thought of an anniversary with Rio was…well, it was something. Gives her a feeling she’s not sure how to name. So she doesn’t try. </p><p>“Two free desserts,” Agatha expertly negotiates. “I’d like to take one back to my kid. And a bottle of champagne — not the cheap shit. If it’s our anniversary and all.” </p><p>The waiter purses his lips. That was a tall order. </p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “Or you can get the manager, and I’ll tell her I saw you spit in our drinks. Unemployed with legal fees?” She clicks her tongue. “Not a great combo.” </p><p>“Okay!” he quickly agrees. “Okay, okay — two desserts and champagne. Just, please — the…” He looks over at the cigarette. </p><p>Agatha snatches it from Rio’s hand and stomps it out on the ground. She and the waiter have a short staring contest before it becomes clear she would not be picking it up. </p><p>“Thank you,” Billy mumbles, crouching down to grab it before scurrying away. Another piece of evidence gone, just like that.</p>

<p>Rio chuckles despite herself. “You terrified the poor kid.”</p><p>“So did you, Ms. ‘I’ve Read Your Policies,’” Agatha replies with an amused sip of water. Because she still didn’t have any more fucking vodka. Shitty ass waiter. “And threatening to pull a Karen with the manager?”</p><p>“Actually, I was planning to tell the manager off for being an asshole.”</p><p>“Noble.”</p><p>“That boy was probably 18. The manager likely got off on scaring him. It irked me.”</p><p>“I sort of got off on scaring him,” Agatha admits with another unashamed gulp of her drink. “Does that irk you, too?”</p><p>Rio considers for a moment. “I don’t approve,” she slowly notes. “But I would approve of you scaring me.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “You’re very forward about what you want but very bad at actually taking it. It’s peculiar.” Agatha was the opposite. Secretive but unafraid to grab whatever she liked. </p><p>The waiter finally — <em>finally</em> — returns with their second round of drinks as well as the promised bottle of champagne. “You’re much too polite,” Agatha informs her as he pops the cork and pours their glasses. “Just like nobody is going to save you, nobody is going to give you any power. You have to steal it for yourself.”</p><p>“I don’t think I have to steal it. I think I have to earn it or…bargain for it."</p><p>“It is steal,” Agatha disagrees as Billy disappears, clearly wanting to spend as little time at this table as possible. “Power, whether you want to admit it or not, is a finite resource — one most people don’t easily part with. And it should always be your first priority. It’s survival. It’s everything.”</p><p>“You can maintain power more easily when it’s not stolen,” Rio argues.</p><p>Agatha feels her jaw clench. What a privileged, righteous view of things. “Well, not all of us have that luxury.”</p><p>“Maybe we try and see if we can find that luxury together sometime,” Rio proposes, so innocent and optimistic it makes Agatha feel simultaneously tender and sick.</p><p>She lifts her palms. “I was trying to offer you some friendly advice, but if you’d rather continue being delusional and naive, that’s just fine.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask for advice, Agatha. Why is it so hard for you to imagine a world where you don’t always feel like you have to fight everyone for everything?”</p><p>Agatha ignores her question in order to pose a few of her own. “Is that a prerequisite? You’ll only want to be in my life if I ask very nicely for what I’m fucking owed? If I stand by like a church mouse while the most undeserving people continue to stay at the top? Because, if so, you should probably just save yourself the time and leave now. That is not who the woman under the enigma is.”</p><p>“I don’t mind you being brash at all,” Rio replies, annoyingly calm. “In fact, I quite like it. What I’m saying is there are smarter, more efficient ways to use that brashness. And that I can help.”</p><p>Agatha bristles at that. “Sweetheart, I’m plenty smart. I’ve got things handled just fine all on my own,” she curtly declares.</p><p>“I know you do,” Rio says, annoyingly patient, too. “You’re very capable. But that doesn’t mean I can’t add anything valuable to the equation.”</p><p>“I work alone.”</p><p>“Well, I’d like to change that,” she challenges, meeting her eyes with an intense gaze.</p><p>Agatha is unfazed. “Not interested. Thanks, though,” she says, tone not particularly sincere.</p><p>“Well, I am,” Rio pushes, adding annoyingly persistent to the list. “And I think you’re only uninterested because you’re terrified of what that would mean for you.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a laugh that’s devoid of humor and full of surprise. The fucking audacity. “Oh, is that so? And what exactly do you think it would mean for me, hm? Let’s hear it.”</p><p>“You would have to admit you’ve become attached again,” Rio accuses, bold and unflinching. “And that terrifies you because of what happened.”</p><p>“And what exactly do you think happened?”</p><p>“You hinted at a bad divorce.”</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, adjusts her cardigan. “Yeah? So?”</p><p>“Being attached again is scary after something like that.”</p><p>“I’m not scared.” She scoffs. “I’m annoyed. I’m perturbed. I’m pissed the fuck off — and rightfully so. But I am not <em>scared</em>.” She shrugs, taking a casual sip of her vodka. “It was rather vindicating, really. Proved that I’m better as a solo act. Everyone else merely holds me back.”</p><p>“It was proof <em> she </em> holds you back. I wouldn’t.”</p><p>“You’re holding <em>yourself</em> back by being with that neanderthal,” Agatha retorts.</p><p>“And so are you by not being open to being with anyone.”</p><p>“No,” she says definitively. “I’m not.” </p><p>Just then, the waiter brings their food. Agatha stabs her steak the minute he sets it down, narrowly avoiding slicing into his hand. “Let’s eat, shall we?”</p><p>Rio looks up at her as she cuts into her chicken. “You can’t be wrong, I see.”</p><p>“Mm, correct — I’m physically incapable,” Agatha quips.</p><p>“So you’d like to think.”</p><p>“So I do take pleasure in <em>knowing</em>. Believe me, hon — this is not a battle you want to fight.” She takes a bite of steak.</p><p>Rio’s mouth curves into a smug little smirk. “I’d fight and win.”</p><p>“That why you became a lawyer? A love of arguing?”</p><p>“That—” Rio nods. “—and I want to help people.”</p><p>“As a lawyer?” Agatha snorts. “That’s like saying you want to help animals as a butcher.”</p><p>Rio shrugs. “I know the system is shitty, but you have to work it to change it.”</p><p>“No, you have to <em>fight</em> the system to change it." Agatha points her knife at her. "You have to <em>game</em> the system to get what you want out of it. You <em>work</em> the system so you can pat yourself on the back for being such a good person — so <em>brave</em> and <em>different</em> from everyone <em>else</em> who works the system without recognizing how awful it is despite still reaping all the benefits of being a cog in the machine.”</p><p>Rio scowls, an irritated passion ignited in her. “Puerto Rico, my home country, is occupied territory by the US. You know, imperialism? I specifically chose to work in human and civil rights so I can eventually be the lawmaker and tear down all of the awful shit they built in that place brick by brick.”</p><p>Rio has never been so annoying or so attractive to Agatha. “Yes, I know <em> imperialism </em> — contrary to apparently popular belief, I’m not a fucking moron. I also know that you’re not going to get what you want by being nice and following the rules.” She cuts another piece of steak. “Or maybe you will. Maybe you’ll be the first person in the history of the world.”</p><p>“Who says I follow all the rules? The good thing about being a lawyer is that you know all the rules have loopholes.”</p><p>“So you’re a corrupt lawyer,” Agatha deadpans. “Which is redundant.”</p><p>“We both know you have no real issues with corruption.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha agrees. “Authority, on the other hand…”</p><p>“I'm not an authority. I’m just a girl who knows how to wield her knowledge.”</p><p>“Keep telling yourself that, hon.” She gestures to her plate. “And eat your chicken before it gets cold.”</p><p>Rio obliges on that second statement, starting to pick at the dish in front of her. After a second, she speaks again. “I’m really <em>not</em> an authority. I work for a human rights nonprofit. The government would gladly see my downfall.”</p><p>“Same.” Agatha pops a truffle fry into her mouth. “The downfall part — not the nonprofit part. I would never waste my time doing something that doesn’t make a profit.”</p><p>Rio gives her a look. “You know I <em> do </em> actually make money from it, Agatha. I think you fundamentally misunderstand how nonprofits work.”</p><p>“I think you fundamentally misunderstand how much I deeply don’t care. Charity, philanthropy, helping people — it’s all aggressively uninteresting to me.”</p><p>“Because you think you’re above it.”</p><p>“Mm, yes — precisely,” Agatha says, taking a sip of her drink without a stitch of shame. “It’s all bullshit — people pretending they care. Everyone is only out for themselves and their own self-interests, but only a rare few are courageous enough to admit it.”</p><p>Rio frowns. “I don’t think so. Sure, a lot of people are selfish assholes, but I think there are people out there who do genuinely care.”</p><p>“Okay. Sure. I’ll give you that. There are a few sorry suckers who actually give a shit. The ones who drown trying to rescue some idiotic show-off who doesn’t know how to swim—" She nods out at the ocean, the tide high. “—or die in a fire after running into a burning building to save a kitten.”</p><p>“And I think those people have won,” Rio counters. “They didn’t let this shitty world take away their kindness.”</p><p>“Those people are <em>dead</em>, Rio. They stupidly valued self-righteousness over self-preservation and paid the price. That’s all there is to it. Suffering is not some honorable thing like you seem to believe.”</p><p>“Hope isn’t suffering, Agatha. It’s more freeing than cynicism and misanthropy.”</p><p>“‘The best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he's in prison.’ Dostoevsky. I’m well-read. You’ve lived on a diet of kindness Kool-Aid for so long you don’t even see how it’s poisoning you.”</p><p>Rio grits her teeth, face flushing the lightest shade of red. “‘The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.’ Audre Lorde. The system you’re clearly so angry at relies on people like you becoming angry and bitter in order to uphold capitalist ideals and white supremacist society that makes people struggle for basic needs and an ounce of joy. ‘Without community, there is no liberation.’ Also Audre Lorde. Being kind is stronger than being cold and bitter in a world that tries to beat it out of you.”</p><p>“As I’ve said, no one’s beat anything out of me, sweetheart,” Agatha replies, voice cool and bordering on bored. “I was born this way. Grab a Ouija board and ask the ghost of my dead mother if you don’t believe me.”</p><p>“You’re just too prideful to admit it,” Rio accuses. “The implication that your mother beat you is quite literally evidence of my point.”</p><p>She scoffs. “Cool it with the ‘evidence’ talk, counselor — we’re not in court. I am prideful, and she did beat me, though that’s actually not what I was implying with that statement.”</p><p>Rio softens a little. “I'm sorry. That she did that.”</p><p>Agatha polishes off her second glass. She’s getting pleasantly drunk, and in turn, her tongue is getting abnormally loose. Agatha is always saying some shit, but that shit rarely included true things about herself — things that went beyond the surface, at least. “It is what it is. I’m not some sad sack who blames everything on their childhood, though god knows my stupid fucking court-ordered therapists sure wanted me to try.”</p><p>“It can actually be good to blame certain things on your childhood,” Rio points out. “It helps you process shit. Make you less miserable.”</p><p>“‘Process.’ Everybody always wants me to ‘process.’ What am I, cheap lunch meat? And I am <em>not</em> miserable. I’m eating steak and drinking free champagne with the prettiest woman at a five-star resort and the greatest kid in the world just inside. I’m living the fucking dream, baby.” She is on the surface. So what if it’s all nightmares underneath?</p><p>“So you say.”</p><p>“I’m pretty insulted you blatantly ignored that very nice compliment I slipped in there about you. I don’t do that kind of thing for everyone you know — group them in with free champagne and my kid like that.”</p><p>The corner of Rio’s mouth curves into a mischievous little smirk. “I noticed. I filed it away for when I decide how good I’m going to be for you later.”</p><p>Well, this is an abrupt change in conversation. Agatha’s certainly not complaining. This was a hell of a lot more fun than the equivalent of a verbal root canal she just endured. “There will be no need for more shoelace bondage or underwear gags then?”</p><p>“Gags, no,” Rio confirms. “Can’t promise on bondage, though. I enjoy being tied up.”</p><p>“But surely you don’t just want a rerun of last night’s show.” Agatha’s almost offended. She had many talents, and she liked getting the chance to demonstrate all of them.</p><p>“No, but I liked elements of it. Maybe tonight, you could get me high and whisk me away.” Rio pulls out a small pouch from her purse and raises a brow.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, you naughty girl.” Agatha clicks her tongue. “He threw a hissy fit over the cigarette — he’s going to have a downright conniption if we light a joint out here.” She throws her head back, letting out a cackle.</p><p>Rio laughs, too. “Well, lucky for him, they’re edibles.”</p><p>“Ah.” Agatha’s chuckles dry up. “Well, that’s not nearly as much fun.”</p><p>Rio shrugs. “Still fun for you when you fuck me, though.”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head. “How do you figure?”</p><p>Rio pops a gummy. “Whisking me away and fucking me while I’m high is a fucking fantasy. Ever heard of CNC?”</p><p>Agatha blinks slowly. Russian fucking doll. “Yes,” she says slowly. “But if you’re high, then you’re not actually able to consent. Or...consensually not…consent.”</p><p>“That’s why you negotiate before,” Rio says with striking nonchalance. “You trust the dominant person to take care of you.”</p><p>“Hm,” Agatha hums, considering. “I’m not opposed, but maybe this is one of those ‘after we get to know each other’ things.”</p><p>Rio shakes the container. “We could both take one tonight?” she suggests.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t turn down free weed. “Fork one over,” she demands, holding out her palm.</p><p>Rio plops one into her hand. “Cheers.”</p><p>“Cheers,” she replies, chasing it with a swig of her vodka. </p><p>Agatha sets down her glass, tracing the rim with her pointer. The curiosity — and concern — eventually get the better of her. “This CNC thing — would this be a fantasy for me or for you?”</p><p>Rio lifts a shoulder. “Could be both. I don’t dare bring it up with him because he actually…does…rape me, but CNC makes sense. You talk about boundaries and rules before, and aftercare is a thing that actually happens. It can be hot for both people.”</p><p>“As I said, I’m <em> not </em> not into it,” she replies. The kind of power she would feel — it would be…intoxicating. Irresistible. Like nothing she’s ever felt before. “You just…shouldn’t feel like you have to pretend you want or like something you don’t on my behalf. That’s all. I get off on making you feel good.”</p><p>“I’m not pretending to like it,” Rio assures her, the smallest defensive edge creeping into her tone. “I do like it. I always have, but I haven’t been able to have that experience safely.”</p><p>She raises her palms. “I’m not doubting you, sweetheart — just for future reference.” </p><p>What the hell was she even talking about? Their future would be, what, four more days? At most? Because that’s what she wanted. Wasn’t it? Maybe not wanted. That’s what she <em>needed</em>. Agatha Harkness didn’t do commitment.</p><p>Rio smirks again. Stupid sexy smirk. “Good to know, love.”</p><p>Agatha cocks a brow. “‘Love’?”</p><p>“Pet name.”</p><p>“Hm,” she hums again. It was too close for comfort, this use of the ‘L’ word.</p><p>Rio’s face drops at that. She picks up her vodka — her second glass of it, and her…tenth? Glass of total alcohol today — and downs it.</p><p>Agatha raises her brow again — higher this time — cutting her last bit of steak without looking at her plate.</p><p>“What?” Rio asks.</p><p>“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’re on the verge of self-destructing.”</p><p>Rio wrinkles her brows. “What makes you say that?”</p><p>“Downing a vodka immediately after taking an edible?” Agatha says dryly. “Either you’re spiraling or I’m atrocious company, and I know <em>that's</em> not the case."</p><p>Rio shifts in her seat. “Self-destruction is the default for me.”</p><p>“Unsurprising. But what’s driven you to it in this particular instance? I like to take notes — hone my technique for driving people mad.”</p><p>Rio stares down at her plate, silent for a moment as she considers — no doubt fighting through all the substances keeping her brain pleasantly numb. </p><p>“I feel like I’m fucking it up,” she finally answers. “I feel like I’m saying the wrong thing and that you think I’m stupid. He always says I am, and maybe he’s right.”</p><p>Agatha looks down, too, swirling her drink around in her glass as she mulls this over for a long moment. Mulls over her response for an even longer one. “I don’t think you’re stupid. I think you’re…” She searches for the word. “Good,” she settles on. “And, yes, usually those two words are synonymous, but there are the rare exceptions. My Nicky — he’s a rare exception.”</p><p>“And you think I am, too?” Rio asks softly.</p><p>“Yes. I think you’re…unlike anyone I’ve ever met.” Agatha hates that she sounds like she’s in some cheesy romcom — talking about her like she’s some manic pixie not like other dream girls — but it's true.</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“Whenever I think I have you pinned down, you do something that surprises me. Say something I’m not expecting. You’re full of contradictions — more than you even realize. It’s fascinating. Usually, I find people very simple and predictable, but not you. You’re this high-powered lawyer who fights for strangers, yet you’re in a marriage where you have no power — refuse to fight for yourself. You have this blunt honesty thing going on, but your whole marriage — your whole life — is a lie. You talk about hope and light when you clearly crave danger — have this sort of…darkness in you,” she says, not unkindly. Almost clinical in her assessment.</p><p>Rio looks up, squinting at her. “What kind of darkness do you mean?”</p><p>“Your taste, your desires — they’re a bit twisted is all.” Agatha shrugs, casually polishing off her steak and popping the last fry into her mouth.</p><p>“I’ve been through fucked-up shit. I think it makes sense that I like fucked-up shit — the kind I’m ultimately in control of.”</p><p>“Oh, you don’t need to defend yourself to me, hon. Only making an observation. You asked.”</p><p>“It was less a defense and more an explanation,” Rio says, chewing on the inside of her cheek. “But as for what you said about my marriage…I did try to fight back for a while. Meeting you makes me want to again.”</p><p>“You have to want to do it for yourself, Rio,” Agatha says seriously. “It can’t be because of me.”</p><p>“I’ve always wanted to fight it. You’re not the reason — just…a reminder that I actually can.”</p><p>“How?" Agatha takes a sip of free champagne. "How do I remind you of that?”</p><p>“I don’t agree with everything you say, but you fight. You literally refuse to admit when you’re wrong.”</p><p>“I don’t refuse to admit when I’m wrong — I’m just not wrong,” Agatha stubbornly declares.</p><p>Rio sighs, ignoring this childish retort. “Point is, seeing you fight reminded me I could, too.”</p><p>A beat as Agatha swirls her champagne. “Well, if you’re going to fight that bastard, you’d better make damn sure you can win.”</p><p>“Hence why I’m biding my time.”</p><p>“Yes, but you also need to make sure you don’t run out of time to bide, darling.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio nods. “I know. It’s all just…overwhelming.”</p><p>“Life is always overwhelming. It’s one big, shitty wave after another crashing over you until you have no choice but to suck it up and learn to fucking swim.”</p><p>“I know how to swim, Agatha. I’m treading water while I catch my breath at the moment.”</p><p>Agatha peers out at the beach, feeling spontaneous. “Prove it."</p><p>The crease between Rio’s brows creases. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Let’s go for a swim.”</p><p>“Now?”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Rio breathes out a laugh. “What about that dessert you made him promise us?”</p><p>Agatha waves a dismissive hand. “We’ll make him box it up — take it to go.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio slowly nods. “I assume we’ll be skinny-dipping.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t want your clothes getting wetter than they already are.”</p><p>“You assume I’m wet?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not assuming anything.” Agatha drains the last of her champagne.</p><p>Rio fixes her with a look, some combination of testing and amused. “You’re not?”</p><p>“Tell me I’m wrong,” she challenges.</p><p>Rio purses her lips and says nothing.</p><p>Agatha smirks. “That’s what I thought — nay, <em>knew</em>. Nobody who’s lucky enough to have dinner with me leaves it dry as a bone.”</p><p>“You’re so confident in that.”</p><p>She shrugs again. “I’ve seen myself. And eaten a lot of dinners. And pussy.”</p><p>“Prove it,” Rio teases, stealing her dare.</p><p>Agatha holds a hand to her chest, pretending to gasp. “<em>Another</em> free dessert?”</p><p>Rio grins. “You know it.”</p><p>The waiter skittishly approaches their table again. “Check,” Agatha demands without even looking at him — eyes fixed firmly on Rio. “And our two free desserts to go.”</p>

<p>Agatha and Rio are walking on the beach approximately seven minutes later.</p><p>“This spot looks fairly deserted,” Rio says as they approach an area a little ways from the resort.</p><p>“Not an exhibitionist I take it?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“I’m not <em>not</em>, but I don’t want to get kicked off this island.”</p><p>“It’s <em> Europe </em> — isn’t every beach a nude beach to some extent?”</p><p>Rio gives her a look, though she begins to unbutton her dress. “There could be children around, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha blows a raspberry. “It’s past 10 — they’re all in bed.”</p><p>“Would you stop arguing with me? It’s not like I need to be further convinced. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m <em> actively </em> taking my clothes off.”</p><p>“As opposed to <em> in</em>actively?” Agatha quips, dropping their boxed desserts in the sand and beginning to strip her shirt off as well.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “You know what I mean.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry — have you not realized by now that my favorite foreplay is seeing how much I can annoy you?"</p><p>An even bigger eye roll. “That’s one of your favorite things point blank.”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “True,” she concedes. “But you don’t like me in spite of my being difficult — you like me because of it. I can tell. You find it hot.”</p><p>“You find <em> me </em> hot,” Rio retorts.</p><p>“Everybody finds you hot,” Agatha flippantly replies, sliding her pants off now. </p><p>Rio pauses with her buttons in order to raise a brow at her. “You really think so?”</p><p>“Again, I don’t think things, Rio — I know them,” Agatha reiterates. She looks at Rio’s face, which seems genuinely clueless. That just couldn’t be true, could it? Impossible. She scoffs. “You must know how you look. How people look at you.”</p><p>Rio shrugs, going back to taking off her dress. “I’m not as aware as you might think.”</p><p>“Work on that.”</p><p>“Hm,” Rio hums. A beat. “Tell me more. About how everyone is attracted to me.”</p><p>“Oh, Jesus. Just because we’re near an ocean doesn’t mean I want to be fished for compliments.”</p><p>Rio undoes the final button of her dress, slowly pushing it over her shoulders to reveal nothing underneath. “Show me then?” she asks coyly.</p><p>Agatha knows what she means, but as she already established, she wasn't going to be taking any bait.</p><p>So she decides to have a little fun with it. Take her words as literally as possible instead.</p><p>“You want me to <em>show you</em> that everyone thinks you’re hot?” The beach is mostly empty, but she can make out two figures in the distance she recognizes from the boat — the tall Black woman and her Asian maybe-girlfriend-maybe-assistant-maybe-both. “I could invite them over here.”</p><p>Rio takes her bottom lip between her teeth, considering, before giving Agatha a little nod. “I think you should,” she says before hanging herself around Agatha’s neck, burying her face in her hair.</p><p>It’s a very dumb idea. They’re playing with fire already, being out in public like this, and inviting more witnesses? Supremely stupid. But they’re drunk on vodka and desire, high on edibles and each other, and Agatha loves an audience too much to pass it up. Loves performing. Putting on a show. </p><p>She puts her pointer and thumb in her mouth, letting out a loud whistle. She still can’t make out their faces with this little light and this much space between them, but Agatha can faintly see both of the women turn their heads in their direction.</p><p>After a moment, they look away again, ducking their heads together to continue their conversation. </p><p>“Ugh,” Agatha huffs. She hates being ignored. She whistles again — even louder this time — and accompanies it with a broad beckoning motion.</p><p>That does the trick, the duo looking up again, contemplating for a moment before slowly making their way over. </p><p>Agatha recognizes the taller one now as some beauty scammer she’d read about in the news. Janine Lettuce? Jackie Arugula? No, <em>Kale</em>. Jennifer Kale. Worst vegetable and most basic bitch name. That was it.</p><p>“Hi,” basic vegetable greets with a tight smile. Her skin is admittedly perfect. Not only that, but her posture is pristine, her steps graceful — like a ballerina or a supermodel. “Is there a reason you’re whistling like a camp counselor? Or a…dog trainer?”</p><p>“I was trying to get your attention.”</p><p>Jen cocks a brow, scanning Agatha — who’s now in her bra and underwear — up and down. “By stripping and splitting my eardrums?” </p><p>Agatha scoffs. “The stripping wasn’t for you — don’t flatter yourself. And it was effective, wasn’t it?” </p><p>Another scan as she crosses her arms. “Well, you have it now. What can I do for you?” </p><p>“We saw you two from across the bar and really dug your vibe,” Agatha drolls. </p><p>Jen blinks. “I’m sorry, what?”</p><p>Jen’s petite little maybe-girlfriend-maybe-assistant-maybe-both sighs. “She thinks we’re attractive,” she interprets.</p><p>“Oh.” A beat. Jen clears her throat, smooths a non-existent wrinkle from her shirt. “I mean, we are.”  </p><p>“You clearly like what you see, too,” Agatha says. </p><p>“Do I,” Jen coolly responds.</p><p>“You’re staring at my tits right now.” </p><p>Agatha just knows she’s blushing. God, she was easy to rile up. “<em>No</em>, I am most certainly <em>not</em>.” </p><p>“So what is it you wanted?” girlfriend-assistant speaks up. “To just…hear you’re hot?”</p><p>“Actually, I wanted to hear that <em> she’s </em> hot.” Agatha nods at Rio.  </p><p>Jen narrows her eyes. She doesn’t even look in Rio’s direction, still studying Agatha closely. “Are you on drugs?” </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha deadpans. “But that has nothing to do with anything.”</p><p>“Are you…looking for an audience?” girlfriend-assistant inquires. “I get the vibe this isn’t just a…naked walk on the beach.”</p><p>“Well, would you be interested in free admission?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Are you, like…sex workers?” Jen asks. </p><p>“Do we <em> look </em> like sex workers?” </p><p>Jen sucks on the inside of her cheek, no doubt racking her brain for what the most politically correct way to answer that would be. Which was Agatha’s whole point in asking, after all. There was no winning. ‘No’ would be to imply she thought there was something wrong with sex work — which she didn’t, of course — but ‘yes’ felt…vaguely insulting somehow. She was probably paranoid that someone was recording this interaction. Jen had a lot of enemies, after all, and Kale Kare did not need another scandal. The thought fills Agatha with glee.</p><p>Rio taking pity and coming to Jen’s rescue, however? Less glee. “No,” Rio informs her. “We aren’t. Just kinky.”</p><p>“Okayyy,” Jen slowly replies.</p><p>“So, yes or no?” Agatha presses. “We’re still waiting.”</p><p>Jen licks her lips, considering. <em>They’re absolute freaks,</em> Agatha can practically hear her think. <em>But they’re <u>hot</u> absolute freaks.</em> Agatha knows that the second part could convince almost anyone to do almost anything.</p><p>“You’re not going to, like, leak this to the press? Or expect me to pay you money?” Jen checks. </p><p>“Jesus Christ — do you want us to sign an NDA before we fuck?”</p><p>A beat. “Alice, do you have any NDAs on you?” Jen asks with 100% seriousness.</p><p>Girlfriend-assistant — Alice — sighs. “Jen, we came to the beach to get <em> away </em> from work.”</p><p>“I’m a lawyer,” Rio speaks up. “And my husband threatened to kill me tonight. Trust me — I don’t need this leaked either.”</p><p><em>Oh</em> <em>wow,</em> Agatha thinks. <em>Wow</em>. Honesty was always a crazy choice, but choosing it in this instance might take the cake.</p><p>Jen blinks at her. “Did you just say <em>threatened to kill you</em>?” She raises her hands. “Yeah, no. I think I’m good on…whatever this is, but thanks.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes yet again. “Oh, relax. I wouldn’t rat you out.”</p><p>“But is there a chance he’s going to find out anyway?” </p><p>“Life is full of calculated risks, isn’t it Jenny?” Agatha asks. “You didn’t get where you are by playing it safe.” </p><p>“How do you know my name?” she snaps. </p><p>“Saw you in the news this morning. Hiding away from those class action lawsuits?” She shakes her head, clicking her tongue. “I didn’t realize you were allowed to leave the country when you were involved in something like that.” </p><p>Jen clenches her jaw. “I’m just laying low until it all blows over. The accusations are bullshit anyway.” </p><p>“Oh? Maybe we should ask the lawyer here—"</p><p>“Shut up. Just shut. Up. Say one more word about those bogus claims — or call me Jenny again — and I’ll drown you in the ocean,” she hisses.</p><p>Rio pinches the bridge of her nose. “No leaking, nothing illegal,” she promises. “I don’t care about your phony-ass brand or lawsuits.”</p><p>“Okay, well it’s not <em>phony</em>…” Jen side-eyes Alice, silently asking what the hell she wanted to do. Alice gives her a little shrug in return.</p><p>Agatha sighs impatiently. She's getting bored. “The offer’s about to expire, ladies.” </p><p>“Oh, so we’re being timed?” Jen snarks. “Do you have a stopwatch or something? You could also be a coach with that annoying whistle. Track and—" </p><p>“Ten,” Agatha starts. “Nine.”  </p><p>“You are not seriously counting down right now.” </p><p>“Eight. Seven.” </p><p>“We’re not children.”  </p><p>“Six. Five.”</p><p>“Who the fuck raised you? This isn’t how normal people act in, like, society.” </p><p>“Four. Three.” </p><p>“This isn’t going to work.”  </p><p>“Twooo—"</p><p>“Okay, fine! Fine!" Jen throws her hands up. "Fuck it. We’re in. But you still haven’t told us what exactly you want us to do.” </p><p>“Just watch,” Agatha says, ridding herself of her bra and underwear before taking Rio’s hand and pulling her the couple of feet to the water. “Commentate. Diddle yourselves. Diddle each other. Whatever tickles your fancy.” </p><p>“Diddle?” Jen repeats under her breath.</p><p>Rio lets out a giggle, which is so fucking cute. Then she kisses Agatha hard, which is so fucking hot. “Taking control, are we?” Agatha asks once she pulls back to catch her breath, raising a brow.</p><p>“Just kissing you,” Rio clarifies with a crooked little smile.</p><p>“Good to know.” Agatha kisses her now, hands slowly traveling down to her waist. </p><p>She enjoys the feeling of Rio pressed to her — her perky breasts, her smooth skin. She’s warm, too. Hot to the touch from the rays of the sun, flushed from the vodka and champagne. Her stomach, though still thin, is the slightest bit more rounded from their meal — soft and full. Agatha loves it. “You’re so fucking perfect,” she whispers.</p><p>“Says you. The most perfect woman in the world.”</p><p>“Perfect is perfect — there’s no ‘more’ or ‘less.’ I thought lawyers were supposed to be good at English.”</p><p>“You make me a little dumb.”</p><p>Agatha snorts — because, fuck, that’s charming — before reaching behind her to grab her ass. Rio lets out a little squeal, taking the opportunity to grind up against her.</p><p>Agatha kneads her cheeks, occasionally using her nails to lightly scrape. “I didn’t get a chance to play with these last night with you on your back.”</p><p>“You like?” Rio breathes.</p><p>“Mm,” she hums in confirmation. “I can see that you do, too.” Her right hand wanders lower, dipping a teasing finger into a fold from behind.</p><p>A sharp whine sneaks past Rio’s lips. “Mommy, please.”</p><p>Agatha responds by moving her hands the smallest bit, pressing her fingertips into her ass and lifting her off the ground. Rio immediately wraps her legs around her, kissing down her neck.</p><p>A little moan escapes Agatha’s throat at that, and she tilts her chin up in order to give Rio easier access. She steps closer to the ocean — just enough for the water to tickle her toes every time a wave comes in — and lets Rio’s lips travel up and down, up and down.</p><p>It doesn’t take long for Agatha to realize that she has prime access to Rio’s tits in this position. Doesn’t take long for her to take full advantage of that, beginning to suck on them.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio whispers, legs squeezing more tightly around Agatha. “Fuck.”</p><p>“Turn clockwise,” Jen says from the beach chair. Her voice comes as something of a surprise — Agatha had almost forgotten she and Alice were there. </p><p>“Pardon?” she obnoxiously asks. Despite forgetting her presence, Agatha had heard her loud and clear. She liked giving the audience what they wanted, but she enjoyed teasing them, too. Edging their eyes. </p><p>“Clockwise,” Jen repeats, irritation creeping in. </p><p>“She wants to see your pretty face,” Agatha whispers to Rio.</p><p>Rio lets out a pleasured little whimper and nods her permission.</p><p>Agatha shifts a little so she’s fully facing the water, Rio facing the two other women. She keeps one hand under her for support, reaching the other up to tangle in her hair and tug her head back. Give them the best view.</p><p>Jen shifts in her chair, no doubt feeling a stir in her stomach — a wetness between her legs. It’s hard to look away, but she manages to pull her gaze from Rio to glance at Alice. Check if this was affecting her.</p><p>Alice is staring raptly, clearly not <em> not </em> intrigued, and Jen hesitates for only a moment before reaching over to rest a hand on Alice’s knee — a fairly innocuous place, all things considered, but undoubtedly a question and invitation all in one.</p><p>Alice glances over, her turn to give a little nod.</p><p>“We’re definitely going to have to disclose this to HR,” Jen whispers, letting her hand travel up to Alice’s inner thigh.</p><p>“We never do.”</p><p>“Because we’ve been discreet up until now.”</p><p>“I don’t mind telling them,” Alice clarifies. “I just don’t want to lose you.”</p><p>Jen adjusts so she’s straddling Alice, grinning down at her. “Luckily, I’m the boss.” </p><p>“Not officially together but not purely professional is what I’m gathering,” Agatha tells Rio between kissing her breasts.</p><p>“I knew something had to be going on between them,” Rio says, nails desperately digging into Agatha’s back. “I saw them on the boat.”</p><p>“Yes, it was just a question of exactly how far Jennifer Kale’s hypocrisy went.”</p><p>“I don’t even really know who she is,” Rio admits.</p><p>“She makes skincare out of gasoline, slaps an ‘organic’ label on it, and charges seven billion dollars an ounce. I’d respect the grift if she wasn’t such a pretentious cunt about it. Do you want to go in the water?”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio hums the affirmative. “That’d be nice.”</p><p>“And do you want to make Mommy feel good?”</p><p>“So good,” she breathily confirms.</p><p>Agatha moves a little further in — so the water’s up to her knees — and helps Rio down onto hers. “You’ll have to hold on tight while you eat me out so you don’t float away.” She puts her hands on Rio’s shoulders to help with balance as well, gently massaging her fingers into them.</p><p>Rio grasps Agatha’s legs before looking up expectantly, awaiting permission.</p><p>Agatha peers down and gives her a little nod. “Make a feast of me, baby.”</p><p>Rio wastes no time doing just that, eagerly kissing up her thighs. Agatha’s fingers tighten around Rio’s shoulders instinctively, her pussy already pulsating in anticipation. The motion spurs Rio into further action, tongue creeping higher and tentatively dipping into Agatha’s wet folds.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. “Keep going.”</p><p>Agatha can practically see Rio’s mischievous little smile, the demand making her slow to agonizing speeds.</p><p>Agatha grits her teeth. Little brat. “Didn’t anyone ever teach you it’s not nice to tease, darling?”</p><p>Her tongue continues exploring at the same frustrating pace.</p><p>“Dangerous game, doll,” Agatha warns, digging her nails into Rio’s shoulder blades. She shifts her pelvis forward and down in an attempt to increase the pressure.</p><p>Rio yelps a bit in surprise, but it seems to do the trick, as she finally begins to suck on Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“Good girl,” she encourages, moving one hand to gently cup the back of Rio’s head, fingers playing with her hair as she does. She can’t seem to stop touching it — so dark brown it’s almost black, so smooth it feels like silk against her palm. Somehow, it reminds Agatha of a midnight sky dotted with a full moon.</p><p>With the added incentive of Agatha playing with her hair, Rio works harder, grazing her teeth over her most sensitive spot. </p><p>Agatha lets her head roll back, letting out another soft moan. She hears someone have a reaction on the beach chair — a quiet, ‘Oh, god. Oh, fuck’ — and lets out another louder sound. It’s slightly exaggerated for the benefit of the performance, for her voyeurs, but it’s not just for show. Agatha doesn’t do anything for show during sex. She makes whoever she’s with earn every expression, every noise, every reaction. Tries to hold them back, even, to make them work harder for her. To make them their best.</p><p>“Don’t stop,” Agatha commands. “But look up at me. It’s my turn to see your pretty face.”</p><p>Rio complies, continuing to swirl her tongue as she peers up through her thick lashes — the same color as her hair. Agatha immediately has to shut her eyes. Rio may be midnight, but looking at her is like staring directly at the sun.  </p><p>“Have you ever done this before?” Agatha whispers.</p><p>Rio nods. “Couple times. In college.”</p><p>“I can tell. You’re very good at it.”</p><p>Rio looks down again, bashful, and begins eating her cunt like she’s positively fucking starving. Like their dinner hadn’t happened at all.</p><p>Agatha breathes out another whimper of pleasure, toes curling in the sand — the tiny grains digging into her feet. </p><p>She glances over at the beach chair — sees their audience. Feels the power she has to have gotten them like this. Abandoning all logic to give themselves over to her and each other. She glances back down — sees Rio. Feels the power she has to have gotten her like this. On her knees and focused entirely on her and her pleasure. </p><p>“Close,” Agatha manages.</p><p>She rolls her hips, seemingly in time to the small waves that flutter in — one with the ocean, with the earth, with Rio. Agatha lets it build and build and build in her core until she’s helpless to stop it. </p><p>A wave of ecstasy rolls through her body at the same time a literal one crashes against it. She holds onto Rio — so hard her knuckles are white as the crest of the wave — grounding herself against the orgasm and current alike.</p><p>Rio dutifully takes it all, bracing herself against the sea and Agatha, the salt from both mixing in her mouth. Agatha can’t help but notice how delicate she is — and how strong, too. Rio stays sturdy until Agatha has fully ridden out her pleasure, her legs going weak with it. She eventually gives into the boneless feeling, dropping down to her knees so she’s level with Rio, panting hard.</p><p>Rio stares at her, eyes wide and lungs heaving. Neither of them can fucking breathe, but that doesn’t stop Agatha from grabbing Rio’s face and kissing her. She needs her more than she needs air. Needs to taste herself on Rio’s lips, her teeth, her tongue.</p><p>Rio moans into Agatha’s mouth, kissing back just as hard. Needing her, evidently, just as much.</p><p>Without breaking contact, Agatha pulls them up and guides them further out into the water — until it’s up to just below their shoulders. “Lie back,” she whispers.</p><p>Rio hesitates, but she ultimately complies, floating face-up.</p><p>Lust pools in Agatha’s eyes as she feels a rush of power once more. Rio’s trust in her was exhilarating — the best drug. “Close your eyes.”</p><p>Another beat of hesitation, some anxiety shining in Rio’s pupils. “You got me?” she whispers.</p><p>“I got you, angel,” she quietly confirms.</p><p>After a long moment, Rio’s eyes flutter shut. </p><p>Agatha starts by placing soft kisses on her shoulder, slowly working her way up to her neck as Rio gently bobs up and down. She can feel Rio’s pulse — hard and fast — in her throat beneath her mouth. “Are you afraid?”</p><p>Rio considers. Her heart beats nine times before she answers. “No.”</p><p>Rio probably should be afraid of her. Agatha Harkness is a criminal — and an unrepentant one at that. She’s been in bar fights, legal fights, pretty much every kind of fight imaginable, and she has the scars to prove it. She makes grown men cry for sport, and she will do anything for power. </p><p>But Agatha Harkness also once found a week-old rabbit alone and on the verge of death in the snowy New Jersey woods. She scooped him up with impossible care, burrowed him in her coat, and brought him home. There, she stayed up until dawn, nursing him back to health and — when it looked like he might not make it — crying over his tiny, shivering body.  </p><p>But the rabbit, by some miracle, did make it, and from that day forth, he was Agatha’s and Agatha’s alone.  </p><p>Rio inexplicably reminds her of him — the rabbit in the woods. Small and resilient and bringing out her capacity for gentleness.  </p><p>Agatha traces a finger — feather-light — down Rio’s torso. “You want to be mine. Only mine.”</p><p>Her heart beats 16 times before she gives a nearly imperceptible nod. “Only yours.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to have to be still,” Agatha warns as her finger gets to Rio’s belly button. “Without any restraints. If you thrash around too much, I’ll have to stop so you don’t drown yourself.”</p><p>“If I drown, so be it,” Rio breathes, body practically vibrating with need as she floats on her back.</p><p>Agatha chuckles lightly, her hand continuing to travel down. “You can make as much noise as you want this time, though. I want to hear you. I want them to hear you, too.”</p><p>“Yes, Mommy.” Rio nods as vehemently as the water will allow. “I’m gonna be so good.”</p><p>Her free hand goes to Rio’s forehead, stopping her movement. “Still,” she reminds her. “Completely still. Relax. Just let Mommy work.”</p><p>Rio whimpers at Agatha’s palm, cool against her flushed face, but she doesn’t fight.</p><p>“Good girl,” she praises, stroking her thumb over Rio's forehead before running a hand through her hair — fanned out like a crown in the water above her. “You’re so beautiful like this, you know that?”</p><p>It’s more wholesome and romantic than Agatha usually goes. It’s clearly more wholesome and romantic than Rio’s used to hearing, too. She sucks in a little gasp. “Oh.”</p><p>Agatha’s other hand finally lands at her center, though it doesn't reach between her legs just yet — and with Rio's eyes closed, she wouldn't know exactly when it would. “You seem like someone who would know who the goddess of water is.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio hums in confirmation.</p><p>“I know you get a little dumb around me, but think,” Agatha affectionately insists, surpassing her cunt to rub at her inner thighs for a moment. “Who is it?”</p><p>Rio shudders at the touch. “Amphitrite.”</p><p>“Amphitrite,” Agatha repeats. “You’re my Amphitrite.”</p><p>There’s the briefest pause before Rio responds, “Thank you, Mommy.”</p><p>Agatha can sense it — that she’s holding something back. She’s not sure what or why, but she’s curious to find out. “Use your words, baby,” she encourages. “I know you remember more than that, even when I do make your brain all mushy. I said I wanted to hear you, remember?”</p><p>“You’re Gaea then,” Rio elaborates. Agatha can feel her get warmer under her hand, suddenly bashful. “They don’t interact much in mythos, but there’s something about you that’s so…grounding.”</p><p>She’s so undeniably strange. And, to Agatha, so undeniably charming. She snakes her hand up, beginning to brush a finger over one of her folds. “Tell me more about her. About myself.”</p><p>“You’re—” Rio lets out a soft moan. “You’re warm, but you have the capacity for coldness.”</p><p>It’s subtle but meaningful — the order in which Rio lists her temperatures. That Rio saw her as inherently warm with the ability to be cold instead of the other way around…well, it hits Agatha harder than she might expect. She inhales a bit sharper than usual. “And how is that like Gaea?”</p><p>“She’s the goddess of Earth, which means she’s nurturing and vibrant but can be harsh and cruel, too.”</p><p>This was feeding her ego in the weirdest, most delicious way. Being compared to a goddess like this is almost enough to make her cum again.  </p><p>Agatha adds another finger, still lightly swirling around the surface of her cunt. “What else?”</p><p>“I—” A louder, more desperate moan. “Please.”</p><p>“What else?” she repeats, her agonizing rhythm holding steady.</p><p>Rio squeezes her eyes shut more firmly in a frantic attempt to focus. “Beautiful. Powerful. Strong,” she quickly lists.</p><p>“If I’m the Earth, that must mean I’m the world then. The whole world. <em>Your</em> whole world,” Agatha reasons.</p><p>“Please,” Rio begs, her shaking intensifying. “Please. I need you.”</p><p>Agatha continues teasing — grazing her entrance here and there. She’s pushing her to her limits, she knows — physically, psychologically. “If you want me to use my fingers, you’re going to have to use your vocabulary, darling,” she challenges.</p><p>“I need your fingers,” she tries.</p><p>“Aww, you can do better than that," Agatha coos. "Like you really mean it, baby — and throw in some SAT words. Tell Mommy how exceptional she is.”</p><p>“I told you,” she insists, a tear managing to escape past her tightly closed lid.</p><p>“Now, now — don’t get all worked up,” she says, voice almost cruelly calm even as she drives Rio insane with want. “If you can’t calm down and behave yourself, I’ll stop. Do you understand?”</p><p>A strangled whine escapes Rio’s throat. “But I’ve been so good."</p><p>“I don’t want you good. I want you great. I want you at your best.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“I suggest you stop throwing a tantrum and talk pretty to me, dear.”</p><p>Rio clenches her hands into fists, nails digging into her flesh. “I can’t.”</p><p>“Yes, you can.” Agatha touches her clit now, though it’s out of warning — not reward — as she pinches it between her fingers. “Focus. Your cunt’s not going to be satisfied until I am.”</p><p>Rio snaps her eyes open, her gaze wide and pleading — her pupils so blown so they’re almost fully black. “Agatha—”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“<em>Mommy</em>—” she corrects through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Eyes closed, remember?” she says, patient but firm. She reaches her free hand up to close her lids — lets her readjust to the darkness for a beat. Then, “I want you to describe me like a poet would.”</p><p>“But I’m not a poet.”</p><p>“Don’t you ever like pretending to be someone you're not?"</p><p>Rio hesitates. “I’ve— I’ve never tried.”</p><p>“That’s not true. You’re pretending to be all mine right now. You’re pretending you’re not going to someone else’s bed after this. You’re pretending that you don’t have a whole lot of shit to figure out once we leave this ocean.”</p><p>“I’m just ignoring it,” Rio whispers. “I want to be yours. All yours. Just yours.”</p><p>“Then tell me why,” Agatha coaxes. “Tell me what it is about me. Don't leave anything out.”</p><p>It’s an ego thing. Of course, it’s an ego thing. But maybe it’s a curiosity thing, too. A lot of people wanted to fuck Agatha. A lot of people wanted to fuck Agatha over. Very few people wanted anything in between. Wanted what Rio seemed to want. </p><p>Very few people like Rio wanted anything to do with Agatha at all.</p><p>“You’re magnetic,” Rio says softly. “You’re safe.”</p><p>Safe. There's that word again. It's an odd one, making Agatha feel deeply touched and deeply nervous all at once. </p><p>Agatha was not dangerous in the way that Thanos was, but she was not what any rational person would call safe either. Rio, however, doesn’t seem particularly rational about much. </p><p>The vast majority of people are scared of Agatha, and that’s by design. She likes it that way. That’s what makes <em> her </em> feel safe. She knows what it is to be feared and adored but not <em>seen</em>. Rio seems to be able to see her. See the parts she’s camouflaged and forced dormant for so long. It's...fucking exhilarating. It's fucking petrifying, too.</p><p>She can’t think about this now. </p><p>So instead, she finally slides two fingers into Rio as the water gently rocks them.</p><p>Rio lets out a whine, bucking her hips. Agatha immediately puts a hand to her chest. “Hold still. Don’t try to take more than I give you.”</p><p>“But I <em>want</em> more."</p><p>“And if I’m feeling generous, I’ll give it to you. But I’m in control of that — not you.” She slowly pumps her fingers in and out. “You like it when I’m in charge, don’t you?”</p><p>Rio lets out a small moan of agreement. Gives her an equally small nod.</p><p>The feeling of Rio constricting around her is exquisite. “My Amphitrite,” Agatha whispers, resting her thumb on her clit and beginning to rub small circles as she gently scissors her fingers — spreading and stretching and savoring each pulse of her pussy. “It’s like you’re trying to swallow me whole.”</p><p>“Because I need you.”</p><p>“And you’re having me. Are you not?”</p><p>“More. Please, Mommy. Please.”</p><p>“Someone’s finally learning their manners.” Agatha adds a third digit and tries not to think of the irony. While she was currently wearing Rio’s cunt on her finger, Rio was wearing a wedding ring on hers.</p><p>Rio mewls, hips beginning to grind up against her hand. Agatha gives her cheek a light slap. “Stop moving. Just melt into the water — into my touch.”</p><p>“Trying,” Rio practically slurs, though she obediently lowers her hips and keeps them there.</p><p>“Try harder, or this is about to be the worst fucking edge of your life.”</p><p>Rio’s breaths get shallower and shallower as Agatha expertly builds the pleasure in her. Challenges her to keep it contained there. She knows she’s getting close — reaching her limit.</p><p>“Ten seconds,” Agatha finally says. “If you can stay still for ten seconds, I’ll let you cum.”</p><p>Rio desperately nods, agreeing to the terms. Though at this point, she’d probably agree to give Agatha her firstborn if it meant an orgasm.</p><p>“Count for me, baby,” Agatha directs.</p><p>“Out loud?”</p><p>“Out loud,” she confirms.</p><p>Rio groans but complies. “One.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t plan on making it easy for her. What’s the fun in that? She curls her fingers inside her as she forces out, “Two!”</p><p>Rio gets to five before Agatha feels her leg twitch. She freezes her hand and makes a big show of frowning despite Rio’s eyes not being open to see it. “Mm, that won’t do. Better start over.”</p><p>“Mommy, <em>please</em>.”</p><p>“Start. Over. No cheating.” <em>No cheating</em>. How fucking ironic.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio frantically agrees. “Okay, okay, okay.”</p><p>Agatha starts her motion again. “Ooone,” she prompts.</p><p>“Two,” Rio manages to add.</p><p>“Keep going,” Agatha encourages, curling her fingers yet again — right up against her g-spot.</p><p>“Three,” Rio squeaks.</p><p>The corner of Agatha’s mouth quirks into a smile. “Little mouse,” she accuses, though there’s undeniable affection laced through her tone.</p><p>Rio purses her lips, oddly endeared by the nickname — so endeared she nearly forgets to say the next two numbers, though she coughs them out in the nick of time. “Four. Five.”</p><p>“I thought you were going to make us start all over again,” Agatha teases. “And on the same number, too. Halfway there.”</p><p>“Six,” she gasps.</p><p>“Lucky seven,” Agatha follows, taking the smallest bit of mercy by helping her — with her words, at least. Her actions are anything but. She knows Rio is close now. Too close for comfort, probably.</p><p>“Eight,” Rio squeals.</p><p>“Nine. Last one.”</p><p>“Ten,” Rio manages. “Ten, ten, ten.”</p><p>Agatha is tempted to tell her the next three numbers in the sequence are actually eleven, twelve, and thirteen, but she figures she’d already tortured her long enough. “Cum for me,” she says instead.</p><p>Rio does just that the millisecond she gets permission, letting out a guttural scream.</p><p>Jen flinches on top of Alice on the beach chair. “Jesus, that scared me,” she mumbles. “Is she being fucked or murdered?” </p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha purrs, putting a hand beneath Rio's back, ready to help her stay afloat if need be. “Such a good girl. You can move now. And open your eyes.”</p><p>Rio manages to flip herself so she’s vertical, immediately wrapping her arms around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Agatha immediately does the same, her hold much firmer — steadier. She lightly presses her forehead to Rio’s, slowly beginning to walk them back to shallower waters.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio says once she’s caught her breath enough to speak.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Can you hold me for a while?”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips. “We should get you dried off.”</p><p>“But I want to be close.”</p><p>“Well, do you want to freeze your ass off, too? It gets chilly at night, and you’re sopping wet.”</p><p>“You can keep me warm,” Rio proposes.</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha hums, stroking her wet hair. “I have to go check on my son,” she says — which is the truth. A very convenient truth. She’d already broken her rule to herself by holding Rio in the bath last night. She couldn’t let it become a habit.</p><p>“Please, Agatha,” she whispers. “Just until my hair is dry so he doesn’t notice.”</p><p>She sighs, considering for a long moment. “You can come back to my room with me,” she decides. “We can watch TV in my bed.” That seemed a very fair compromise.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Just until your hair is dry.”</p><p>Agatha could offer a blowdryer, of course. But then again, Rio could have asked for a blowdryer, too. Neither of them wants to rush this — that much is clear.</p><p>“Have a good night, ladies,” Agatha tells Jen and Alice as she picks up their desserts and passes them with a smirk. “I’d say I hope you enjoyed yourselves, but I already know you did.”</p><p>"God," Jen mutters to Alice once they're out of earshot. "She's fucking insufferable."</p>

<p>“I’ll just be a minute,” Agatha whispers once they make it back to her room. “Put this in the fridge and fetch us some water, won't you, doll?”</p><p>Rio nods, putting their desserts into the small refrigerator and going to fill two glasses.</p><p>Agatha cracks Nicky’s door as slowly and quietly as possible — though she curses herself for not being even slower and quieter when he stirs. “Mama?” he mumbles. </p><p>“Hi, baby,” she greets. “I’m just checking on you.” </p><p>“Mm." He rubs his eyes and looks at her. “Why’s your hair wet?” </p><p>Agatha sort of regrets not waiting to talk to him until her hair was dry, too. “Mama went for a little swim,” she explains. </p><p>He frowns, sitting up straighter. “Without me? But swimming’s my favorite.” </p><p>She has to stifle a smile. “I know. I’m sorry. I’ll take you tomorrow — I promise.” </p><p>“Okay…” he says slowly. His brows are furrowed, still clearly a little upset — and confused. “Who’s in here?” </p><p>Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. She decides to try and play dumb. “What do you mean, buddy? <em>I’m</em> in here.” </p><p>He looks at her like she’s an idiot. And she is for trying to pull one over on him. He’d inherited her curiosity, unfortunately. And her inability to tolerate bullshit. “Who else? I hear more feet.” </p><p>Agatha valiantly resists the urge to cringe. “The woman I went swimming with.”</p><p>“Do I know her?” </p><p><em>Fuck</em>. Fuck, fuck, <em>fuck</em>. Saying no could make him uncomfortable, freak him out — make him call Wanda and have <em> her </em> all uncomfortable and freaked out, which is the last thing she needs. But telling the truth…well, that would open up several cans of worms. Agatha usually has no issue lying, but when it comes to her son? </p><p>“Yes,” she admits.  </p><p>He looks at her as if to say, ‘Go on.’ But Agatha doesn’t owe him any more than that. Agatha doesn’t owe him anything but clothes on his back and food in his stomach. <em> She’s </em> the mother, and he’s only six, for god’s sake. She’s— </p><p>She’s sounding like her own mother. Oh god. She’s sounding like Evanora, and that just won’t do. </p><p>“Rio,” she elaborates. “It’s Ms. Rio.” </p><p>Nicky gasps, practically jumping up. “I want to see her!” </p><p>“No, Nicky,” she says firmly. “It’s far past your bedtime—“ </p><p>“That’s not fair! I didn’t even get to go swimming with her, and she’s <em> my </em> friend, too,” he pouts. </p><p>Agatha rubs a hand over her face. He’s inherited her stubbornness as well. “You can say hi to her.” Nicky grins. “But that’s <em>it</em>, Nicky. I mean it. Then it’s back to bed.” </p><p>“Yaaay!” He moves to step onto the floor. </p><p>Agatha puts a palm up. “Uh-uh. Stay here. She’ll come to you.” </p><p>He obediently lies back down, and Agatha sighs, going back out to the main area. “So, he’s awake right now,” she announces.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio says, awkwardly holding two water glasses in her hands. “Uh, do you want me to leave?”</p><p>“No, no,” she says quickly. “He, um…well, he’s demanding to see you.”</p><p>Rio blinks, a little taken aback. “I’m happy to. If you’re okay with that.”</p><p>Agatha puts her palms up. “Oh, I very much don’t have a choice in the matter,” she says, though the way the corner of her mouth curves into a tiny smile tells her it’s fine by her.</p><p>Rio gives a small smile in response before setting the water down and entering the room. “Hey, Nicky.”</p><p>“Ms. Rio!” He beams. “I missed you.”</p><p>“I missed you, too, friend.” She goes to sit on the edge of his bed. “How have you been?”</p><p>“Good. I ate ice cream today — two scoops — and saw my seagull again. But I didn’t chase him this time.”</p><p>“Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun.”</p><p>“How do you say seagull in Spanish?”</p><p>“<em>Gaviota</em>.”</p><p>“What about bird?”</p><p>“<em>Pájaro</em>. Do you want to know how to say ‘I love birds’?”</p><p>“Love is <em>amor</em>!” Nicky proudly exclaims.</p><p>“Mhm, that’s right, but that’s a slightly different kind of love. In Spanish, we say ‘<em>amor</em>’ when we love a person. Usually, when we’re talking about this sort of thing, we use '<em>encantar</em>' — ‘<em>me encanta los pájaros</em>.’ But if you wanted to tell your mom you love her, it’s ‘<em>amor</em>.’ You’d say, ‘<em>Te amo</em>.’”</p><p>“Ms. Rio?"</p><p>"Hm?</p><p>"Do you <em>amor</em> my mom?”</p><p>Rio blinks again — even more taken aback than before. She desperately hopes it doesn’t show on her face. “It’s…a little more complicated than that,” she carefully decides. “The kind of love you have for your mom is familial, and the kind you’re asking me about is romantic, which is hard for me sometimes.”</p><p>He tilts his head. “Why?”</p><p>“Well, because your mom and I both have a lot of things going on.”</p><p>“<em>I</em> have a lot going on, too,” he insists.</p><p>“I know,” Rio says seriously. “Which is why you should rest.”</p><p>He lies back down — a little sulkily — and pulls the covers to his chin. “I can’t sleep unless somebody sings to me.”</p><p>“Oh.” She purses her lips. “Do you want me to get your mom back in here? Or…I mean I could do it. If you wanted.”</p><p>“Mm…” He considers for a moment. “You can,” he decides. “Can you do it in Spanish?”</p><p>She gives him a soft smile. “Of course.”</p><p>Nicky is back out in minutes thanks to the musical stylings of Gloria Estefan, his breathing heavy and calm and content.</p><p>Agatha’s been waiting by the door, listening to the whole thing. “I hope you know that’s not typical,” she says once Rio has closed it behind her.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“That kid does not just go to sleep like that without a fight.”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Rio shrugs. “I just…talked with him and then sang to him. He said it helps him sleep.”</p><p>“It does,” Agatha confirms with a nod. “But it’s usually a much longer process to even get there.”</p><p>Rio shrugs again, breathing out a laugh. “I don’t…really know what to say.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. “Well, you could start by sharing your secret. That would be appreciated.” She grabs the water, leading her into the master bedroom. “Are you a witch?" she teases. "Did you cast some sort of spell on him? Do I need to learn magic, hm?”</p><p>“No,” Rio chuckles again. “At least, not that I’m aware of.”</p><p>“Mm,” she hums. “Well, you’re very sweet to him.”</p><p>“I have no reason not to be.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes as she pushes her door open. “You’d be surprised how many grown adults don’t agree.”</p><p>Rio grimaces a bit. “I’m not sure I would. I’ve met plenty of assholes. People can be shitty, even to kids.”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha hums again. “At least it makes it all the more satisfying when I steal their wallets or frame them for money laundering,” she says, voice teasing though her words are sincere.</p><p>Another breathed-out laugh as Rio immediately goes to lie down on the bed. “Fair enough.”</p><p>Agatha gives her a faux sympathetic pout, setting their glasses on the nightstand. “Aww, did I wear you out, sweetheart?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio admits with a pout.</p><p>“Such a baby.” Agatha flops onto the bed next to her, running a hand through Rio’s hair. “You’re an only child, I presume?”</p><p>Rio immediately cuddles close to her, nodding into her chest. “Mhm.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t judge, I suppose. I am, too.”</p><p>“Yeah. I mean, maybe I have a sibling somewhere. I wouldn’t really know.”</p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “Your dad’s the type to spread his seed like that?”</p><p>Rio lifts her face to shoot her a horrified look. “First of all, that’s a gross fucking way to word it,” she says, giving her arm a light slap. “And second of all, I meant my mom. I have no idea if she ever remarried or had more kids. She could have a whole second family for all I know.”</p><p>“You’re not even Facebook friends or something?”</p><p>“No. I figured she’d never want to see me again. I mean, she left me when I was still a baby.”</p><p>“What if she sent you a request?” Agatha asks. “Would you accept it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Maybe,” Rio quietly says. It’s clear her mom is still a sore subject — even after all these years. “Yeah, I think maybe I would,” she decides after a moment. “Just to ask her why.”</p><p>“God." Agatha scoffs. “You really are a masochist.”</p><p>Rio's brow wrinkles. "What do you mean?”</p><p>“Why do you want to know why? I mean, is there any world in which her answer to that isn’t going to cause you some flavor of emotional turmoil?” Agatha reaches over to her bedside table, pulling a handful of chips from a bag and casually stuffing them in her mouth. “If my mother sent me a Facebook request from beyond the grave, I’d accept it, too — but only so I could tell her she was a cunt and a half one last time.”</p><p>Rio shrugs. It’s taking her longer to respond to Agatha’s prying questions than usual in her post-sex, substance-ridden haze. “I think…I think I just want closure, even if it hurts. I mean, I’ve wondered my whole life. My dad is such a good parent, and I love him — so much — but he won’t talk about her or why she left. He never has.” She chews on the inside of her cheek. “Once, he said I sort of look like her. I still don’t know how I feel about that.”</p><p>Agatha stares up at the ceiling fan, the blades almost mesmerizing in her state. “Sounds like she’s a sexy piece of shit if she looks like you.” She pops another chip into her mouth, chews thoughtfully. “My mother loved to tell me why my father left.”</p><p>“Your mom also sounds like a piece of shit from the few things I know about her,” Rio mumbles.</p><p>“Well, yes. Obviously. But are you not interested to know why he pulled a disappearing act?” Agatha presses.</p><p>A beat. “I suppose.”</p><p>“It was because of me,” she says with an eye-roll and breathed-out laugh that sounds a lot less authentic than she means it to. Than she wants it to.</p><p>Rio frowns. “That’s awful. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Well, these things are bound to happen when you’re born evil, you see?” Her voice comes out with less bravado than she’d prefer, too.</p><p>Rio pulls away enough to look at her head-on now, concern etched in her features. “That’s ridiculous. No one is born evil, and that includes you.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “I mean, obviously.” She averts her gaze, picks at a hangnail. “I always found her logic quite strange and stupid. It was easy for her to believe I was born evil but not a lesbian with a freakishly high libido. That, evidently, was a choice."</p><p>Rio laughs despite herself, nestling back into Agatha’s side. “My dad was always cool with me being bisexual. That’s what I said — that’s what I thought — I was for a long time.”</p><p>"But you still felt pressured into marrying an ogre?"</p><p>"In a way. I didn't date much in high school, so it was all pretty hypothetical back then. Deep down, I always worried that he secretly hoped I'd end up with a man — or at least envisioned me in a more traditional relationship. I didn't want to complicate things. Give him any reason not to be proud of me, you know?"</p><p>Agatha doesn't know. She'd never made her mother proud. Learned very early not to even bother attempting such an impossible task. But she doesn't say any of this, of course. “Honestly, I think I’ll be most disappointed if Nicky turns out to be straight,” she deadpans instead. A beat. “But frankly, I don’t think I have to worry about that.”</p><p>“I’m certainly glad I don’t suffer from that condition,” Rio teases.</p><p>“I’m glad, too, hot stuff.”</p><p>Rio shifts her head on Agatha’s chest. “You’re very comfy,” she notes.</p><p>“Yes, it’s all me. It has nothing to do with the pillow top mattress and six million thread count sheets you’re lying on. I really appreciate you giving credit where it’s due.”</p><p>“It’s, like, 70% you,” Rio insists. “The sheets are soft, and the blanket is nice, but you’re extremely cozy.”</p><p>“Is it my pillowy tits or the fact I always run refreshingly cold?”</p><p>“Your tits are a big plus.”</p><p>“Pun intended?”</p><p>Rio smirks. “Maybe,” she confesses.</p><p>Agatha snorts. “You’re such a cheeseball.”</p><p>“You like it.”</p><p>“It’s occasionally endearing.”</p><p>Rio scoffs, offended. “More than occasionally,” she says, reaching up to play with a strand of Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Somewhat frequently,” Agatha amends, teasing now. She holds a chip to Rio’s mouth, inviting her to eat it. She breathes out a laugh as she watches her take it in her mouth and chew. “I’m a little offended.”</p><p>Rio furrows her brows. “Why?”</p><p>“Because you’re making the same face eating that chip as you do when I make you cum.”</p><p>“Well, you making me cum is 10 times better, but I’m <em> really </em> hungry right now.”</p><p>Agatha laughs again. “Fair enough.”</p><p>“Can I have another?”</p><p>Agatha plucks another from the bag, placing it in her palm this time.</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio shoves the chip in her mouth and drapes a leg over Agatha. “I wish I could stay here,” she muses.</p><p>“In Sicily?”</p><p>“With you.”</p><p>Her lips become a thin, straight line. Maybe a part of Agatha wishes that, too. “But you won’t,” she tells her, running the back of her hand down Rio’s leg.</p><p>“Not tonight, but after he’s…dealt with I’d like to.”</p><p>“And you’ve decided? How you’re going to…deal with him?”</p><p>“Not yet,” Rio admits. “All I know is I’m working on it.”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha hums, continuing to rub her hand up and down her thigh. A beat. “How’s that going for you?”</p><p>“I’m laying low tomorrow so I can get a chance to call my dad. Then I’m changing my plane ticket home to…somewhere else.”</p><p>“Back to your dad’s?” Agatha asks. She can’t help but feel a little disappointed despite the fact that was an absolutely insane emotion right now. It’s not like she could offer her room and fucking board in New Jersey.</p><p>“No idea. Like I said at dinner, I’d like to…try with you after this. For real. It’s just a matter of me getting my shit together and being safe enough to do so.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha awkwardly starts. “Trip’s only half over, and you have my number.”</p><p>“That’s a good start. I’ll be using it.”</p><p>“To put me on telemarking lists?” Agatha teases with a smirk. “I do that to my ex-wife. Eventually, she got so annoyed she changed her number, but joke’s on her — we share custody, so I got her new one as well.”</p><p>Yet another laugh Rio is clearly trying to hold in. “Mm, no. I’ll be texting you. Preferably like we did today.” She suggestively wiggles her brows.</p><p>“All right, that's fine. Though I do get a thrill out of yelling at customer service workers.”</p><p>Rio’s brows wrinkle in confusion. “What does that have to do with anything?”</p><p>“If you put my number on a bunch of shitty lists, I would have more of them to yell at.”</p><p>“I guess that’s true…” Rio relents. “But not my plan.”</p><p>“It might be a good idea, Rio,” she says, voice more serious but gentler, too. “To get a more concrete plan.”</p><p>“I’m trying. I— I’ve started to slowly pack my stuff back up and disentangle my accounts from his. I worked on some of that today while we were wine tasting.”</p><p>“You’ve changed your mind before, haven’t you?” Agatha asks, voice uncharacteristically free of judgment. “You’ve started this process only to be sucked back in? When you’re in it this long, there’s a cycle. A pattern.”</p><p>“No, actually. I’ve never gotten this far. Never even got past the self-blame part before this. Your support…has been helpful.”</p><p>“Oh,” she says with a little frown. “That’s interesting. I—” She shakes her head. “Never mind.”</p><p>The space between Rio’s brows creases. “What?” </p><p>“No, nothing. It’s silly. Unimportant.” Agatha shakes her head, suddenly feeling very vulnerable and embarrassed despite not having said anything at all.</p><p>Rio tilts her head. “It’s probably not,” she says, so earnest Agatha can’t deny her.</p><p>She sighs. “I…read an article. Many articles, actually. At that boring as fuck talk Nicky dragged me to.”</p><p>“What type of article?”</p><p>“About…your situation.” It’s a humiliating thing to admit, maybe because it shows that she doesn’t know everything, or maybe because it shows that she does care, or maybe a little bit of both. The cause is unclear, but one thing that isn’t is that it’s humiliating.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio says slowly. “And?”</p><p>“And I learned that it often takes people more than one try. That they chicken out or ultimately go back. You can’t do that, Rio. It…I…” She doesn’t know what the hell to say, so she repeats, “You can’t do that.”</p><p>Rio sits up straighter, looking at her more seriously. “I don’t want to, Agatha. I mean, he threatened to kill me. He’s never done that before. And I know if I don’t do this right, he will. I have one chance at this — I just…” She lets out a breath, looks down at her lap. “Please don’t give up on me while I’m getting everything ready,” she softly pleads.</p><p>Agatha cups her face, beckoning her to back up — not speaking until she makes eye contact. “I’m no quitter.”</p><p>Once Rio nods, Agatha switches to stroking her hair — still wet but drying. Drying too fast, time slipping away. “You shouldn’t be alone when you tell him.”</p><p>“I don’t want to be,” Rio whispers. Then, somehow even quieter, “I’m so scared.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha replies, which she supposes is her way of volunteering to be present without having to outright do it. “Nicky, however, will be kept far, far away from all of this.”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio agrees — maybe a little offended Agatha even felt like she had to say it. “He doesn’t need to know how awful humans can be.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure he’s well aware of that by now,” Agatha admits. “But still — I’d do anything to protect my boy.”</p><p>“He deserves the world,” Rio gently muses. “I think most kids do.”</p><p>“‘Most.’” Agatha snorts a little despite the seriousness of the conversation. “Are you beefing with a six-year-old somewhere?”</p><p>“No,” Rio says, grinning as she shoves her. “I don’t know — some kids just already have it all.”</p><p>“True. Snot-nosed little brats.”</p><p>“Even so, I don’t wish <em> ill </em> upon them. Maybe just… some perspective.”</p><p>“Then you’re a better woman than I.”</p><p>Rio scoffs. “They’re kids, Agatha. I’m not wishing ill on a child.”</p><p>“Well, when children make fun of <em>my</em> child for <em>actually</em> being ill, I’d like them to get a taste of their own medicine,” she says, a protective edge in her voice now — a sore subject. “Literally,” she flippantly adds — a bad joke to lighten the mood.</p><p>Rio hums, thinking for a moment. “I do understand the instinct,” she confesses. “I think my dad probably thought the same thing when kids bullied me.”</p><p>“My mother preferred to join in,” Agatha says, offhand and without really thinking.</p><p>Rio blinks, unaccustomed to this particular brand of nonchalant trauma dumping. “That’s incredibly fucked up.”</p><p>She shrugs. “I gave it to her right back.”</p><p>“It’s still fucked up. I’m glad she was told how shitty she was, though.”</p><p>Another shrug. “Someone had to do it, and I thoroughly enjoyed every time that someone was me. Everyone always goes on and on about therapy, but I find that calling people cunts has a similar effect.”</p><p>“Both are good. Both is always an answer.”</p><p>“Not always,” Agatha disagrees. “Not for me.”</p><p>“Yes, for you,” Rio says, another stern, stubborn look coming out. “You just have to find the right therapist and figure out the right people to call cunts.”</p><p>“The number of therapists who are right for me is zero, and the number of people who deserve to be called cunts is limitless,” Agatha defiantly insists. “Ironically, a lot of therapists are cunts. Most of them, in fact.” The one at conversion therapy when she was 12. And the school counselor when she was 14. And the court-ordered specialist when she was 21 and 36 and 40 and—</p><p>“I strongly disagree there. There are plenty that are, but a lot of them really want to help.”</p><p>“Not in my experience,” Agatha says curtly, running a hand through Rio’s hair. “Just about dry,” she notes, desperate to change the topic.</p><p>Rio mercifully drops the subject, sighing and curling in closer again. “I hate that.”</p><p>“You could always splash some more water on it.”</p><p>“I suppose. Though I don’t want him to snap tonight. To get out all the way, I have to play his game for a few more days.”</p><p>“The moment you start playing someone else’s game, you’ve already lost,” Agatha declares. “You have to make your own — always.”</p><p>“I know, but this is part of mine in a way. He keeps my passport with his on trips. No matter what, I have to get that back, and I’d prefer to do it without incurring serious bodily harm in the process.”</p><p>“I could pretend to be a housekeeper. Steal it from your room when you’re not there.”</p><p>“That’s not a bad idea.”</p><p>“I was kidding…” Agatha says, though the fact Rio is taking it seriously inspires her to do so as well. “Although, that does sound rather fun. I quite enjoy costumes and improv.”</p><p>“It probably wouldn’t be hard to pull it off. I can give you my key — make sure he’s distracted tomorrow.”</p><p>“All right,” Agatha relents. Because why not, at this point? Why the hell not? “Do that, and text me when you’re out.”</p><p>“I will. He keeps the passports in the outside pocket of his suitcase. The obnoxious bright blue one.”</p><p>“The <em> outside </em> pocket? He really is a fucking moron.”</p><p>Rio groans. “I know.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “Okay. Well, I usually like more of a challenge — getting to crack a safe or something — but I can manage that.”</p><p>“No safes this time. Sorry.”</p><p>“Disappointing. I’ll just have to impress you with my heist skills another time, I suppose.”</p><p>“I don’t need to see them to know you have them.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha smirks a little. “How so? Is it because I’m so excellent with my fingers?” She wiggles her brows.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “Now who’s the cheeseball?”</p><p>She runs said talented fingers through Rio’s hair again. “Dry,” she notes. She moves it down to her inner thigh — close to her center. “Unlike this,” she teases.</p><p>Rio halfheartedly whines at the touch. “Don’t tease me like that when you know I can’t stay for another round.”</p><p>Agatha inches the smallest bit closer. “Don’t act like you don’t love it.”</p><p>“I do,” Rio admits. “It’s very nice. Though, I just enjoy being around you point blank.”</p><p>Agatha can count the number of times she’s heard that on one…finger. “Well.” She clears her throat. “I’ve had worse company than you, too.”</p><p>“Will you walk me back? So we can have a few extra minutes?”</p><p>“You’re asking me to leave my warm bed and bag of chips so you can be in my presence mere seconds longer?"</p><p>Rio pouts.</p><p>“That little puppy dog eyes thing doesn’t work on me. Just ask Nicky.”</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>She reaches into the chip bag next to her, coming up empty. “Fine. But only if we go down to the lobby first — get me more snacks.”</p><p>Agatha pushes herself from the bed and puts a finger to her lips. “We don’t want to wake him again. I can’t deal with another interrogation.”</p><p>Rio holds up her hands in silent surrender, impressively managing to retrieve her shoes without a sound.</p><p>Despite how careful they’re being, Nicky’s door inches open right before they can open the main one. “Mama?” </p><p>Agatha cringes before turning to face him. “What, baby? You’re supposed to be in bed, remember?” </p><p>“Are you going swimming again?” </p><p>“I’m just walking Ms. Rio back to her room.” </p><p>“I wanna come.” </p><p>“Nicky.” Agatha rubs her temples. “I’ll be right back. You need sleep, or else you’ll be cranky tomorrow.” </p><p>“Nuh-uh.” </p><p>“<em>Yes</em>-uh.” </p><p>“Nuh-<em>uh</em>.” </p><p>“Nicholas.” </p><p>He cowers a little — clearly more from the embarrassment of being chastised in front of his new friend than out of fear. Full name meant she was serious.</p><p>Rio turns to face him. “Get some sleep for me, okay?” she softly requests. “It sounds like you’re having a really good time here, and you’ll have a less good time if you’re tired.”</p><p>“Will you play with me tomorrow?” Nicky pleads. “My mom can throw rings in the pool, and we can dive for them. Or— or we can build a sandcastle! I have a bucket. And a shovel. We can share them.” </p><p>Agatha cuts in. “Nicky, you can’t just—”</p><p>“Will you?”</p><p>“I’d love to,” Rio says. “But it does depend on a couple of things.”</p><p>“What does it depend on?” </p><p>“Nicky…” Agatha warns again. </p><p>He promptly ignores her. “Is it your…your…” He racks his brain, trying to think of what disease she’d told him she had. “Your pans?” he tries. “Is it hurting you? You can have some of my medicine.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth quirks into a small smile. “Close — POTS. And thanks, bud, but I have my own medicine I can take. It’s…a little more complicated than that.”</p><p>“Complicated like how?”</p><p>“<em>Nicky</em>.”</p><p>“Something scary,” Rio vaguely admits. </p><p>His eyes widen. “Like a ghost?” he whispers.</p><p>“Not quite like a ghost,” Rio patiently replies. “But it’s something that scares me like ghosts scare you. If your mom wants to explain more, she can, okay?”</p><p>Nick looks at Agatha. “M—”</p><p>“Not now, Nicky.” </p><p>“But—“ </p><p>“Maybe tomorrow. If you go back to bed right now.” A beat. “And stay there,” she adds. He liked to argue technicalities just as much as she did. </p><p>He turns to slowly go back to his room, head craning back longingly. “Goodnight, Mama. Goodnight, Ms. Rio.”</p><p>“Goodnight,” they both reply in sync. As if they’re one. As if they're meant to be.</p><hr/><p>Rio misses Agatha the second her door shuts to her and Thanos’ room. The second she’s not in view. Especially when the view she gets instead is Thanos sprawled on the bed, shirtless and playing games on his phone. </p><p>“Back as promised,” she announces. “I’m going to hop in the shower.” She supposes it’s ironic — intentionally getting her hair wet after she had waited all that time for it to dry.</p><p>She braces herself for an interrogation — she had been subconsciously preparing excuses all night, really; practicing her pleading skills — but he doesn’t question her. Nor does he yell or even look up from his screen when he says, “Okay.”</p><p>It’s off. It’s so fucking off. She should be grateful for it, but it’s almost scarier, the fact he seemed to be ignoring all of her indiscretions. </p><p>She stalls in the shower. Turns the water up so high her skin scalds and vomits up her chicken parm, watches the awful chunks swirl down the drain. She has the disgusting thought that she wishes she could follow the bile — sink down, down, down so she would never have to face him.</p><p>Eventually, she does have to get out. Has to brush her teeth and put her pajamas on and lie down in bed next to him.</p><p>“Did you have a good time with your friend?” he asks, still looking at his screen.</p><p>“Yeah,” she says, a hand under her pillow as she faces away from him. “We ended up sitting by the water for a bit since the weather was nice.”</p><p>“Good. Glad to hear it.”</p><p>She purses her lips. “I’m tired — I think I’m gonna go to sleep.” </p><p>She prepares herself for a fight, but again, none comes. “Sounds good.”</p><p>What the fuck? What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck? “I hope you had a good night,” she lies. That’s part of the game, too.</p><p>“Thank you — it was productive. Sleep well,” he says, running a hand through her hair. His voice is calm, his touch soft, but there’s an undeniable eeriness to it.</p><p>A week ago she’d be calling herself crazy. A week ago, she’d convince herself it was all in her head. But this trip had snapped her out of that delusion — <em>Agatha</em> had snapped her out of that delusion — which means she’s more terrified than ever as she falls asleep.</p>

<p>Rio wakes up to a light kiss on her nose. “Morning, sleepyhead.”</p><p>“Hm?” she groans, Thanos’ face coming into view as she blinks awake.</p><p>He laughs lightly. “I just said good morning. It’s after nine. You never sleep after nine.”</p><p>“Guess vacation is draining me,” she says with a small yawn, forcing a smile. It seems he’s still in his strangely good mood, and as ominous as it is, she wants to keep it that way as long as possible. It’s better than the alternative, after all.</p><p>“I made you some tea,” he says, handing her a mug.</p><p>“Oh.” She blinks in surprise. He’s never made her tea. He’s never made her anything. “Thanks.”</p><p>“You’re welcome. You deserve it.”</p><p>She leans down to blow on and discreetly sniff it. It’s mint, which is not her favorite — she preferred something floral like lavender or jasmine — but she drinks it anyway to appease him. Plus, she was thirsty. She had consumed a lot of alcohol yesterday.</p><p>Maybe that’s why she feels like absolute shit — a feeling that seems to get worse by the second. Her head is pounding as she answers a few work emails, her stomach churning as she slowly gets dressed, the room spinning as she brushes her hair. </p><p>Rio can usually suck it up. Rio always sucked it up — showed up to work on time dressed in a suit and a smile no matter what horrors Thanos had inflicted on her the night prior — but this is next-level bad.</p><p>“I’m not feeling so great,” she admits. She hates to do it — hates to feel any weaker than she already does around him — but she doesn’t feel like she has much of a choice. She’s not particularly confident she could walk in anything resembling a straight line at the moment. Was she still drunk? Or high? Or cross-faded? Was it the combination of everything she’d ingested last night? “Why don’t you go ahead to breakfast, and I’ll catch up. I think maybe I just need to lie down for a few minutes.”</p><p>Thanos shakes his head in faux sympathy. “No can do. You need some food in you. But first, you need some me in you. That’ll be the cure — for all of it,” he says, shoving her onto the bed. It doesn’t take much to knock her down, and he has a strange, chilling look in his eyes that Rio’s never really seen before. It’s like he knows she won’t fight him. Not hard, at least. It’s like he knows she <em>can’t</em> fight him. Not right now.</p><p>“I love you like this,” he whispers as he climbs on top of her, beginning to take what he wants. The sick thing is, he means it. “I wish you could be like this all the time.”</p><p>Rio’s blood runs cold as her mind slowly puts the pieces together. It’s not the champagne or the weed or anything she did last night. It’s the tea. He drugged the motherfucking tea he gave her this morning, and she drank it. She drank every last drop like the stupid bitch she was.</p><p>“What did you do?” she asks anyway, voice weak but full of more terror than it’s ever been. Her mind is moving slow, but her body is moving ten times slower, her limbs heavy and movements uncoordinated. “Thanos, what did you do?” she repeats, desperately attempting to fight through the haze and get him off, get him off, get him <em>off</em>.</p><p>He pins her easily. “Can’t a husband just make a nice cup of tea for his wife?”</p><p>She squeezes her eyes shut, tears immediately burning them. “Please stop,” she whispers.</p><p>“You stop,” he tells her, voice quiet and low as he continues to thrust into her. “Just relax and enjoy it.”</p><p>“I don’t want it, Thanos. Please,” she begs.</p><p>“Shh,” he hushes her — voice still so soft it’s somehow more condescending than usual. “You probably won’t even remember it later.”</p><p>A sob escapes at that. How fucking violating it would be to not be able to remember being violated at all. “That’s not okay,” she insists. She doesn’t know why. He won’t care. He never cares.</p><p>“What’s not okay is the way you behaved last night. Stomping around, sneaking around, making insane accusations and being a mouthy bitch. Did you really think there wouldn’t be consequences? Did you really think I’d just let that slide? I’m in charge — always. You got that? You’re mine, and without me, you’re nothing. You’re fucking nothing, Rio.”</p><p>“Please, Thanos. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p>“Just shut up, Rio. Or I’ll have to make you, and I have a feeling you’re not going to like how.”</p><p>Her pleading isn’t working, so she switches to demanding. Deep down, she knows it’ll be no use, but perhaps it might make it slightly easier on her pride. Make it slightly easier to live with herself. “Let me go!”</p><p>“Shut. Up,” he repeats, a dangerous glint forming in his eye.</p><p>“No!” She wriggles and squirms and thrashes and yells and does everything she can. She does everything she can, and it’s still not enough. It’s never enough.</p><p>He covers her mouth with one hand. “I said be quiet," he hisses. "Now stop fighting, or this will take even longer, and I have all day.”</p><p>It’s not a conscious decision to have her body go limp, but that’s what it eventually does. Her body goes slack beneath him, and her mind floats above it all, watching. Despite the growing panic, whatever he put in her drink is making it hard to stay awake.</p><p>“Good,” he says as she goes loose. “It’s so much easier when you’re good from the start, but you never seem to learn.”</p><p>He finishes fast — just like he always does — rolling off of her. He pants, catching his breath for a few moments, before swinging his legs over the mattress. “Put your shoes on. After I take a piss, we’re going to eat,” he announces.</p><p>Rio gives him a faint nod as she stumbles up to retrieve her shoes and sits back down on the edge of her bed. Her hand shakes as she attempts to put them on, her movements somehow robotic despite the fact the simple task is requiring an intense amount of concentration at the moment.</p><p>He returns from the bathroom momentarily, sighing impatiently as he sees her still fiddling with the strap of her sandal. “Hurry up — buffet’s only ‘til 10.”</p><p>Rio gives him another numb nod as she finally manages to secure the clasp. “Okay.”</p><p>He holds his hand out to help her up. “Take it,” he demands before she can reject it. “You’re not going to be able to balance otherwise.”</p><p>With a weak whimper, she does as she’s told. She doesn’t have a choice. She never does.</p><hr/><p>Thanos loads up at the buffet, getting truly ungodly amounts of eggs, bacon, and pancakes. Sex always makes him hungry.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, doesn’t have an appetite at all. Maybe it’s all in her head — a side effect of whatever the hell he gave her — but she swears she can feel people staring at her in the hallway on the way down, whispering about her as she fills up a glass of water, shooting each other concerned looks as she forces herself to get something from the waffle station.</p><p>She’s snapped out of her paranoid daze when a tiny voice exclaims, “Ms. Rio!”</p><p>Another form of panic sets in as she looks over to see Nicky loading up his own waffle with whipped cream, chocolate chips, and sprinkles. She has to try to act normal in front of this kid. This sweet, innocent kid. She forces her mouth into another smile. “Hey, Nicky. Did you sleep well?”</p><p>His mouth drops into a small frown at the question. “A little bit. But then I woke up and coughed a lot, so Mama had to come pat my back and give me my inhaler.”</p><p>“Well, I’m very glad she was there to take care of you. Are you feeling better this morning? It looks like you’re hungry.” She nods to the waffle. The small movement is enough to make her head spin.</p><p>His mouth quirks back up, his smile more bashful this time. “Mama said I could put all the toppings I wanted since I was a brave boy as long as I didn’t tell Mom she let me eat it all. Mama told me that you were brave last night, so you can probably have sprinkles if you want, too.”</p><p>Her heart is breaking and melting all at once. How could it be that people like this kid existed on the same planet as people like her husband? “All right, I will definitely keep that in mind. I’m proud of you for being brave.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Nicky says sheepishly. “Do you want to sit with us? You can see my seagull friend from our table.”</p><p>Rio has never wanted anything more in her life. “I can’t right now — I still have to be brave for a little bit. You promise you’ll show me your seagull friend later?”</p><p>“You maybe could see him from your table,” Nicky suggests. “I’ll come sit with you and point at him.”</p><p>Rio has never wanted anything less in her life — than to have someone like this kid forced to interact with someone like her husband. She purses her lips. “Nicky, can I ask what your mom said about my situation?”</p><p>Nicky shuffles a little, looking down at the ground. “She said…she said that you live with someone like Grandma. Mama didn’t like Grandma. She said she did mean things.”</p><p>“Mhm, that’s right. I’m going to try and not live with him soon, but because he’s mean, I don’t want you to have to meet him. So do you think you could show me your seagull friend later?”</p><p>“What about in five minutes,” he attempts to negotiate.</p><p>“It’ll have to be a little longer than that.” The look on Nicky’s face makes it clear he’s highly displeased with this answer. “It’s for your safety,” Rio explains.</p><p>“What’s for his safety?” Thanos asks, stepping behind Rio — no doubt already up to get seconds. He places his free hand on her back, giving Nicky a forced smile.</p><p>For the second time today, Rio’s blood runs cold. She gives Nicky a look, silently begging him to play along. Silently begging the universe to give Nicky the skills to interpret her expression. “I told him he doesn’t need to chase after another seagull.”</p><p>“I have one seagull friend already,” Nicky informs him. Rio would breathe a sigh of relief, but she knows they’re not out of the woods yet. That they’re not in the clear. </p><p>“You can’t be friends with birds, bud,” Thanos replies, grabbing a piece of bacon straight from the serving tray and popping it into his mouth.</p><p>Nicky frowns. “Yes, I can. Mama said so.” </p><p>“It sounds like your mama is too soft on you. Wants to keep you from living in the real world.” </p><p>Nicky wrinkles his brows, opening his mouth to speak. Instead, a cough comes out. Then another. And another. Watery and thick. </p><p>Thanos backs away in disgust. “Ew. Cover your mouth, you diseased little freak.” </p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha asks, swooping in and scooping Nicky up in one fluid motion. It happens so fast that Rio’s not exactly sure where she materialized from. </p><p>Agatha pats Nicky’s back while looking at Thanos. “What the fuck did you just say to my child?” </p><p>It takes a moment before it registers on Thanos’ face. “You’re my wife’s friend from last night.”  </p><p>“And I’m about to become your problem today if you don’t give my kid a fucking apology, you son of a bitch.” </p><p>“Wow, great example you’re setting for him, cursing at me like that.” He turns to Rio. “And you took parenting advice from her?”</p><p>“You were a jerk to her kid, Thanos,” she says. It’s a bold move — one that will surely get her ass kicked, make this morning look like a picnic — but she has to. He’s not going after her now — he’s going after Nicky and Agatha.</p><p>“He was getting snot all over the place,” Thanos defends. “Is that what you want at breakfast? Do you want mucus on your waffle, Rio? It's not sanitary." </p><p>“He’s six, and he has cystic fibrosis, you ignorant prick. I wish he’d coughed directly into your mouth,” Agatha retorts, voice as sharp as her touch is gentle as she continues patting Nicky’s back. </p><p>“So <em>I</em> could get sick?” </p><p>“It’s not contagious,” Agatha replies. “Jesus Christ — didn’t you just invest in a pharmaceutical company? No wonder the American healthcare system's in the toilet.” </p><p>“What happened to the nice lady I met at dinner?” Thanos asks. </p><p>“I killed her,” Agatha growls.</p><p>“Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive Mendelian trait,” Rio points out. “You quite literally cannot catch it.”</p><p>Thanos rolls his eyes. “God, you’re such a know-it-all. It’s so unattractive.” </p><p>“Better than being a know-a-nothing,” Agatha quips. </p><p>“Why are you still standing here by the waffle bar?” Thanos questions.</p><p>“Why are you still standing here on this planet?” she snaps back. </p><p>“Mama,” Nicky softly whines. “I hurt.” </p><p>Agatha purses her lips. She clearly does not want to back down from this fight. But she was fighting for Nicky, and he needed her to be a nurturing mama bear right now instead of a feral one. </p><p>“I hurt, Mama,” Nicky repeats, soft cries beginning to rack his body — something he really did not need along with the coughs. </p><p>“Shh,” Agatha soothes, gently bouncing him as if he’s a baby again. “It’s okay, honey. I have your PEP mask in my purse,” she says, giving Thanos one last glare before going back to her table. </p><p>Thanos turns to Rio. “Don’t ever fucking embarrass me like that again. Taking that whore’s side over mine? Have you lost your fucking mind?”</p><p>“No, I haven’t,” Rio replies. But the truth is, maybe she has. And maybe that’s not the worst thing. The drugs and adrenaline are making her bolder and less anxious and completely unlike herself, and maybe that’s not so bad. “You embarrassed yourself. It’s also not very smart to call women you don’t like ‘whores.’ It makes it seem like you don’t know the definition of the word.”</p><p>“Oh, I know the definition. And that she talked very openly about her sex life within five seconds of meeting me last night. I thought maybe she was just a little weird, but now I see she's truly fucking crazy. You’re not allowed to talk to her anymore.”</p><p>Rio realizes that she would rather fucking die than never talk to Agatha again.</p><p>Rio might end up doing just that. Dying.</p><p>“No.” She shakes her head. “No, you don’t get to do that anymore. You don’t get to do that anymore because…” Fuck it. Fuck it all. “Because I’m leaving you, Thanos.”</p><p>“Leaving me?” he asks, voice serious and mouth a thin line before he bursts into mocking laughter. “Leaving me? <em> You </em> leave <em> me </em> — oh, you’re <em>funny</em>, Rio.”</p><p>“No, I am,” she says, tone as serious and decisive as it’s ever been. It’s not what she envisioned for this moment, but things were rarely what Rio envisioned. Maybe it was always going to be like this — not some big, planned-out speech but a spontaneous blurt by a waffle bar. Maybe that’s the only way she’d ever get the courage. “I’m fucking leaving you. You hit me, and you rape me, and you fucking drugged me.” There’s a strange power in laying it all out like this — accusing him in public, even if there weren’t any immediate witnesses listening in.</p><p>Thanos rolls his eyes. “Oh, for fuck’s sake — it was some Xanax and molly. I didn’t inject you with fucking heroine. And for the millionth time — I fuck you exactly how I know you like it. Which I’m allowed to do because you’re my wife. That’s all.”</p><p>“No, I don’t like it,” Rio says, gaze fiery and voice firm. “Listen to me: I hate it. I hate it, and I hate you. This is over.”</p><p>“Fine.” Thanos scoffs. “Go. You’ll come crawling back by sundown — I know you will.”</p><p>Rio won’t. Rio can’t.</p><p>So instead, she’ll crawl to Agatha and hope to god she hasn’t just made the biggest mistake of her life.</p>

<p>“Can we talk?” Rio asks, approaching Agatha’s table. She’s still feeling shaky, though whether it’s from the drugs or the adrenaline of what she’s just done, she’s not entirely sure. Maybe some combination of both.</p><p>“I’m a little preoccupied,” Agatha replies without looking at her, rubbing Nicky’s back. </p><p>Nicky moves his PEP mask away from his face. “I’m okay now, Mama,” he insists. </p><p>Agatha immediately places it back over his nose and mouth. “You keep that on, young man.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t want to intrude — she really doesn’t — but it’s not like she has much of a choice right now. She’s high as fuck, and she’s just blown up her entire life. “It’s— It’s urgent. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth, no doubt to snap at her, but she stops short when she sees her face. And Nicky’s face. And she must decide she can’t. Not now.</p><p>So instead, she sighs and purses her lips before opening her mouth again. “You mean in private, I presume?”</p><p>That would be ideal, but Rio knows there’s no way in hell Agatha is walking even the shortest distance away from Nicky for even the shortest amount of time right now — nor would Rio ever ask her to. So instead, she pulls out her phone and opens her notes app, attempting to type in spite of her blurry vision. She manages a mostly cohesive message: <em>Drugged me. Scaared. Told him Iwas leavng</em>.</p><p>Agatha blinks, head dipping back the smallest bit in surprise. She looks into Rio’s glassy eyes for a few seconds before decisively standing from the table. “Nicky, sweetheart, let’s go back to our room.” </p><p>“But I didn’t get to eat my waf—"</p><p>“We’ll order you an ice cream sundae through room service. All the same stuff on top.” </p><p>He perks up at that. “For breakfast?” </p><p>“For breakfast,” Agatha confirms, already nudging him up. “Come on.”</p><p>Rio stays put, unsure of what to do. She doesn’t want to be presumptuous, after all. She wraps her arms around herself, suddenly feeling so…small. She certainly doesn’t want to be a burden. Doesn’t want to be an imposition or—</p><p>Agatha waves a beckoning, almost impatient hand at her. “You too. Let’s go.”</p><p>Rio nods, squaring her shoulders as best she can before walking to the building with them.</p><p>“Want me to hold your hand?” Nicky asks, peering up at her.</p><p>It’s weak and stupid, but she doesn’t really want to be touched — doesn’t really feel <em> safe </em> to be touched by anyone but Agatha. It was insane, too. Nicky was sweet — the sweetest — and he was a child. He was a literal child who wouldn’t, who couldn’t, hurt her. So she pushes down her irrational feelings and hopes he doesn’t notice the hesitation before she offers it to him.</p><p>Agatha must sense it somehow — this ridiculous conflict she’s having — and intercepts the hand Rio holds out before Nicky can. She shuffles Nicky to the other side of her, taking his hand as well. “I’m going to hold both of your hands,” she asserts.</p><p>Rio could cry at the kindness of the gesture, but she settles for giving Agatha’s hand a light, grateful squeeze instead.</p><p>“When we get back, you both are going to be very good patients for me, yes?” Agatha asks. </p><p>“Ms. Rio’s sick?” Nicky inquires, brows pinched in concern. </p><p>“Yes, she…ate something bad,” Agatha explains — not technically a lie. “So the two of you need to rest for a while.” </p><p>“And eat ice cream?” </p><p>“And eat ice cream,” Agatha confirms.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio whispers to her.</p><p>Agatha simply nods, keeping her gaze forward. Rio can practically feel the adrenaline simmering in Agatha's palm — the rage flowing through her veins — from how Thanos spoke to Nicky and perhaps what he’d done to her. Rio can practically see the wheels turning in her head — telling herself to channel this in a way that doesn’t come as naturally for her. Not violence towards him but softness towards her son. And perhaps toward her, too.</p><p>“Please don’t pass out in front of my kid,” she tells Rio, voice low.</p><p>“Won’t,” Rio promises. It’s a struggle to utter every word. Every syllable.</p><p>“Do you want to watch <em> Dora </em> with me, Ms. Rio?” Nicky asks. “And hug Señor Scratchy? My stuffed one — not my real one. My real one’s at home with Mom because Mama said he couldn’t come on the plane.”</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath, preparing to rip more words from herself. “You’re really sweet to offer all of that, Nicky. I think right now I just need some quiet time, though. Like your mom said, I ate something that made me feel really bad.”</p><p>“Oh.” He frowns, disappointment written all over his face. “Okay.”</p><p>It breaks her heart to break his heart. “Maybe we could do a hug if you wanted?” she suggests — an awkward compromise, maybe, but she can’t think of anything better right now.</p><p>He tilts his head. “My bunny? Or me?”</p><p>“Whichever you’d like.”</p><p>“Hm.” He ponders this very seriously as they reach their hall. “Well, maybe I could hold bunny, and then you could hug us at the same time. Or is that cheating?"</p><p>“I can do that.” Rio nods. "Promise me you’ll get some rest, too?”</p><p>“Grown-ups are always making me rest,” Nicky complains with a stomp of his tiny foot. </p><p>“Stop the whining, or you can have cabbage and raisins for breakfast,” Agatha cuts in. “And instead of <em>Dora</em>, I’ll put on the news.” Rio knows it’s more than likely an empty threat, but it shuts him up fast.</p><p>“I have to rest, too, if it makes you feel any better,” Rio offers with a small smile. “Sometimes, grown-ups have to, too.”</p><p>“Okaaay,” he reluctantly agrees. “Maybe after you’re done with your quiet time, we can do something fun while we still rest,” he proposes as Agatha unlocks their door.</p><p>“We’ll see — okay, bud?” Rio asks, sliding her sandals off in the entryway so as not to track sand in.</p><p>“Nicky, why don’t you call your mom? I bet she’s missing you,” Agatha suggests — something Rio knows she absolutely does not do. She’s said more than once how much she hates that woman. But she’s also said more than once that Wanda and Nicky could yap for hours, and they do need him distracted from the shit show that was Rio’s current state and predicament. Rio tries not to think about what that means — Agatha taking one for the team like this. Taking one for her.</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky says, seeming to brighten a bit at that. “Can I tell her that I held my breath underwater for three whole seconds? And that I made a seagull friend? And that I built a sandcastle almost as tall as me?” </p><p>“You can,” Agatha permits. Rio sees her quickly change the name in her phone from GINGER BITCH to simply WANDA before going to hand it to him. Before she does, she holds up a finger. “Just no mention of—”</p><p>“Ice cream for breakfast or Ms. Rio,” Nicky recites. “I know, Mama.” </p><p>Agatha nods. “Ms. Rio and I are going to rest in my room. I’ll order your ice cream, but no opening the door when they knock — I’ll come out here and get it. And no running around. Plant your butt on the couch and keep it there. If you’re feeling better later, maybe — <em>maybe</em> — we can go to the pool, all right?” </p><p>“Okay, Mama.” </p><p>“Good boy.” She ruffles his hair and gives him a kiss on the top of the head before handing him the phone.</p><p>“Do you still want to hug bunny and me first, Ms. Rio?” Nicky asks, grabbing his stuffed rabbit.</p><p>“I would be happy to.” She gives him a smile — small but sincere — as she crouches down to wrap her arms around him. She tries to keep herself from wincing at the change in position. Tries to keep the nausea rising up in her chest at bay.</p><p>“You’re a good hugger,” Nicky notes.</p><p>“Thanks, bud,” she whispers before standing back up. “You go rest now, okay?”</p><p>“Ms. Rio?”</p><p>“Nicky…” Agatha warns, albeit gently. </p><p>“I just have one more question. I pinky promise.” </p><p>Rio imagines he was always saying that. One more question, one more song, one more glass of water or trip to the bathroom. Still, Agatha indulges him. “Okay. Ask it.” </p><p>“Ms. Rio, are you going to be my mom, too?” </p><p><em>Oh</em>. Oh, Rio really wishes Agatha had not indulged him. </p><p>“I— Well— That’s…that’s a complicated question,” Rio stammers out. She feels her face grow hot and knows it must be some combination of the inquiry and the drugs in her system. A recipe for disaster.</p><p>He frowns. “You say a lot of things are complicated.”</p><p>“I know,” she sympathizes. “Because they are. I wish they weren’t.”</p><p>“Mm.” His frown deepens. “Well, I would be happy,” he says. “If you were.”</p><p>Rio is speechless. Rio is on the verge of bursting into tears. Rio is…</p><p>Rio is feeling like her world is spinning out of control. Rio is attempting to keep the bile from spilling out of her mouth. Rio is running to Agatha’s bathroom to vomit up the few contents left in her stomach.</p><p>“Ms. Rio!” Nicky calls, attempting to dart after her. </p><p>Agatha catches him by his shirt. “Give her a minute, Nicky.” </p><p>“But— But—" Tears well up in his eyes. </p><p>“Shh,” Agatha soothes as she crouches in front of him, putting a hand on both his shoulders. “It’s okay, Nicky. She’s okay.” </p><p>“She’s not,” he insists, lip wobbling. </p><p>“She will be,” Agatha promises. “You know how I take care of you when you’re feeling bad?” </p><p>He nods, sniffling. </p><p>“Mama is going to do the same thing for her, okay?” she says, thumbing away his tears. “Can you try to be brave and take some deep breaths for me?” </p><p>He nods again, inhaling a few shaky times, followed by a few coughs — not great but not necessarily cause for concern on their own. </p><p>“Good,” Agatha praises. “Good boy. Do you think you can relax out here for a little bit while I make sure she’s all right?” </p><p>Another nod. </p><p>She gives his shoulders a squeeze. “Okay,” she says softly. “I love you, baby.” </p><p>“I— love you, too, Mama.” </p><p>Agatha places another kiss to his temple before heading into her bathroom. </p><p>Once inside, she immediately crouches down next to Rio. “I’m going to tell you what I just told my six-year-old: breathe.”</p><p>Rio gives her a small nod despite the fact that more bile rises up in her throat — another retch wracks her body. “I’m— I’m sorry,” she heaves.</p><p>“Less talk, more breathe.”</p><p>Rio attempts to suck in another breath — this time through her teeth — which seems to do the trick. She manages to take a small gulp of air. Then another. And another. Finally, she feels her body go limp, the top half of her slumping down onto the toilet bowl. It was unsanitary. Disgusting, really. And yet, Rio can’t bring herself to care.</p><p>“Do you feel like you're going to hurl again?” Agatha checks.</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “I’m just tired,” she says, the admission followed by a sob she hadn’t felt coming. It’s vaguely mortifying — not only the action itself but being so caught off guard by it. She wants to crawl into a hole, but she settles for curling up on the floor instead.</p><p>“No, Rio,” Agatha says, gentle yet firm. “We’re not doing that yet, all right? First order of business is getting you to a bed.”</p><p>She’s right. Rio knows she’s right. As much as she doesn’t want to move, she forces herself to unfurl herself from her little ball and grab onto the sink in an attempt to pull herself up. She feels like a baby giraffe, clumsy and unbalanced. </p><p>Agatha grimaces, sucking some air through her own teeth now before putting her arms out in Rio’s direction. “Jesus, Rio — take it easy, would you? I don’t want to touch you without your permission, but I also don’t want you cracking your head open on the side of my tub.”</p><p>Rio drops back down to the floor and looks at her, considering. She can practically feel how red her eyes are — from the drugs and the tears. Can practically feel the dark, exhausted circles forming beneath them. “Go ahead,” she tells her, throat raw and voice ragged.</p><p>Agatha seems a little relieved by this. “It’s like 10 steps,” she assures her, taking her arm and helping her up. “15 tops if only because this bathroom is fucking enormous.”</p><p>She can’t help but let out another small whimper as Agatha leads her to the bed. It feels like fucking miles instead of mere feet, and by the time she collapses onto the mattress, she’s winded. She’s about to go back to the relative safety of her curled-up position, but it’s like Agatha’s a mind reader or a fortune teller, butting in before she can.</p><p>“No, Rio. Still not yet.” She disappears into the bathroom briefly before turning with a glass of water and a damp washcloth. “Sit up and drink this. Come on.”</p><p>The thought of anything going into her stomach sort of made Rio want to kill herself — drinking water sounded about as appealing as eating glass at the moment — but she sits up just enough to let Agatha hold the cup to her lips. After she’s sipped about three-quarters of it down, she pulls back and looks at Agatha for approval.</p><p>She shakes her head, tapping the bottom of the glass with her nail. “Whole thing.”</p><p>Rio whines, a half-hearted and petulant sound that Agatha seemed to enjoy hearing in a much different, more fun context.</p><p>“Stop whining, or I’ll feed you cabbage and raisins, too.” </p><p>Any other time, Rio would tell her to get some new material — that what worked on her six-year-old son was not going to work on her. </p><p>But this isn’t any other time. </p><p>Instead, she wordlessly finishes the rest. </p><p>“You can lie down now,” Agatha permits, putting the empty glass on the nightstand.</p><p><em>Thank fucking god</em>, Rio thinks. She lies back, immediately squeezing her eyes shut. But instead of blocking out the memories, calming the feelings of forced intoxication, lessening the horror of feeling so…violated, her eyelids are like a dark, blank canvas for it all to be displayed. Heightened. Made worse.</p><p>The feeling of Agatha gently placing the wet washcloth on her forehead helps a little, serving to ground and soothe her. Rio knows she should probably be lying on her side instead — less risk of choking on your own vomit that way — but it was fine. Well, as fine as it could be, which is to say, not very fine at all.</p><p>She tries to focus on her breathing again — sucking in little puffs through her teeth. She thinks she has it under control, but when she opens her mouth to say something — "sorry," probably — only a strained, incoherent sound comes out. And maybe that’s for the best.</p><p>“If you apologize for being drugged, I will intentionally go slam my head against the bathtub,” Agatha threatens. “And then make you pay for any and all medical attention it requires.”</p><p>Rio knows that, just like the cabbages and raisins, it’s not really a threat, but she can’t help but flinch at the violent image anyway.</p><p>She hears Agatha walk over to the hotel phone. “I’m ordering you food — avocado toast and a green smoothie,” she announces. “Obnoxious, I know, but you need magnesium when you come down from this shit.”</p><p>Rio nods, heaving in another breath. “Want to shower,” she manages to force out.</p><p>“Later. After you’ve eaten. You can barely stand up right now.”</p><p>A strange panic blooms in her chest at that. Suddenly, this request feels urgent. Now that she’d noticed it, she couldn’t <em>un</em>notice it. She opens her eyes, then, looking at the other woman intensely. “Agatha, I— I feel him. On me. All over.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, pausing mid-dial to consider. “I can let you sit in the bath,” she compromises. “Or get you another cloth to wash off with.”</p><p>“Bath.” Rio nods.</p><p>“I’ll run it after I order breakfast,” she says, punching the rest of the numbers for room service. “You’d think a luxury resort wouldn’t still have a goddamn corded phone, but alas.”</p><p>The smallest ghost of a smile flicks on Rio’s face at that. It feels foreign and wrong. Like a shape her mouth shouldn’t be able to make.</p><p>After Agatha has ordered — from the same waiter from the previous night, Rio’s pretty sure, from the voice she can make out on the other end of the line and Agatha’s generally shitty attitude toward them — she disappears into the bathroom to fill the tub.</p><p>“Try and drink another cup,” she orders as she returns with another glass of water. “Hydration is important right now. Believe me, I’ve done a lot of drugs in my day.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t even bother arguing this time. She doesn’t have the energy. Plus, it’s…sort of nice — feeling cared for like this. Strange and uncomfortable but nice, too. </p><p>Agatha stands near the bed, arms crossed over her chest, finger tapping the one on top. “Do you have any idea what the son of a bitch gave you?”</p><p>Rio nods. “Molly,” she says, voice even hoarser than before. “A benzo.”</p><p>“Psychopath,” Agatha mumbles, blowing out a breath. “Though I’ve ingested plenty of both, and I’m all right. I’m sure you will be, too.”</p><p>Rio looks down at the glass in her hand. “I’m scared,” she finds herself confessing in a whisper. Maybe she’s baiting her. Maybe she wanted Agatha to cradle her. To tell her everything was going to be all right. To feed her comforting lies. </p><p>“I’m telling you that you don’t need to be. I’ve taken a lot harder, and the best thing you can do is wait it out, get some food and water in you, and try to relax. Panicking about it is only going to make you feel worse. Just try and...ride the high as much as you can.” </p><p>Rio gives her a look, and Agatha holds up her palms. “Maybe that sounds fucked up, all things considered,” she admits. “But...in my experience, that's what works."</p><p>Rio nods. She continues to look at her, but her gaze turns pleading now. Agatha had given her verbal reassurance, but she was still craving the physical. Everything was starting to feel so…far away. Almost like it wasn’t real. She finds herself floating to that space she so often does with him — the one slightly above reality. The one where she’s detached from her body, looking down at it.</p><p>Usually, with him, it’s something of a comfort. But without an immediate threat, the beginning stages of the dissociation freaks her out. She doesn’t want to drift. She wants to stay here with Agatha where it’s safe, and she can't hang on unless she has something to grip. Unless she has Agatha within reach.</p><p>Agatha sighs softly, doing her weird mind-reading trick again. “I can’t now, Rio. We can’t. Nicky’s wide awake and right outside — plus, the bath’s almost ready.”</p><p>“The bath isn’t running yet,” Rio stutters out, her anxiety rapidly increasing along with the cadence of her breaths and her frustration at Agatha’s stupid fucking made-up rules for herself. Rio needed her. Can’t Agatha see that she needed her? She didn’t want to have <em> sex </em> right now, for fuck’s sake. She just wanted Agatha to put her arms around her — hold her together so she wouldn’t fall apart. Why couldn’t she see that? Why could no one ever see that?</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrow, a small frown appearing on her face. “The bath <em> is </em> running, sweetheart,” she slowly reminds her. “I turned it on after I called for the food.”</p><p>Rio blinks, trying to focus. Everything suddenly feels too bright, and the sounds. Oh god — the sounds. There are so many of them, and they’re all happening at once. So jumbled and noisy she can’t separate one from the other. Can’t tell them apart let alone process what the hell they are.</p><p>Rio covers her ears, hoping that’ll get the strange static to stop at least. Hoping that’ll help this all feel not so fucking unbearable. She’s not sure if it’s a panic attack or a sensory meltdown or some combination of the two — all she knows is it’s hell. All she knows is that she’s in hell, and she’s all alone there.</p><p>All she knows is she’s always in hell. </p><p>And she’ll always be alone there.</p>

<p>Agatha doesn’t know what the hell is going on. Rio seems to be having some sort of…seizure. Or psychotic break maybe. She doesn’t fucking know — all she knows is she’s clearly not well. Agatha was usually the ‘jump into action’ type, but she finds herself oddly frozen, helplessly watching. God, she hated feeling helpless. “Rio…?” she asks. “What’s happening?”</p><p>“I’m overstimulated,” Rio snaps through gritted teeth, body beginning to shake as she continues to cover her ears. “I need you to hold me. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p>The seriousness of her tone is weirdly disarming. “Okay,” Agatha says, quickly climbing onto the mattress beside her. Maybe the tub would overflow, flood the bathroom. And so what if it did? Let it. Let it trickle into this room and drown them. </p><p>“All right,” Agatha says, wrapping her arms around her. Something — though she’s not sure what — tells her that, despite her sensitive state, she will want her grip to be tight. “Okay,” she repeats. “All right.”</p><p>Agatha feels Rio trembling against her and once again thinks of her rabbit — the way he used to quiver until she tucked him into her arms, stroked his silky ears.</p><p>“Again, breathe,” Agatha orders, though her tone is gentle.</p><p>Rio takes one hand off her ear, dutifully hitting her sternum with her fist as if the action will help.</p><p>“Not—" She grabs her hand before it can come down again. “—like that. Look at me.” This was mercifully in Agatha’s wheelhouse, with Nicky having a respiratory condition and all. </p><p>Rio does as she’s told once more, craning her head back to look at Agatha.</p><p>She places Rio’s hand on her chest. “Feel what I’m doing and follow it.” She takes a deep inhale through her nose, an equally deep exhale through her mouth.</p><p>It takes Rio several long tries before she can even manage to suck in half a breath. Agatha can tell by the way the space between her brows pinches that she’s frustrated. Can tell by the clench of her jaw that she’s getting discouraged.</p><p>“It’s fine, Rio,” she assures her. “You’re fine. Just keep going. Focus on me — nothing else.”</p><p>After another small eternity, Rio takes a deep breath in, a few more tears coming out with the exhale. She’s still not well by any means, but she seems sufficiently calm at least. That was something, Agatha supposed.</p><p>“The bath should be ready now,” she tells her.</p><p>Rio nods. She seems to be cognizant of the water now, which was another something. Still, even the tiny movement of her head is sluggish — exhausted and not quite right.</p><p>Agatha purses her lips. “Not to sound totally infantilizing, but would it be okay if I carried you?”</p><p>Rio nods again, a silent plea in her eyes.</p><p>“All right,” she says softly, shifting so she can pick her up. Agatha was much more comfortable with this part of caretaking — when she had a clear task and purpose and it was primarily physical instead of emotional. </p><p>When they get back into the bathroom, she gingerly sets Rio on the edge of the dangerously full tub. “Would it be okay if I helped you take your clothes off?”</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>“All right,” she repeats once more. She takes the hem of Rio’s shirt and lifts it over her head before going to unhook her bra. “It’s okay if you don’t want to talk,” she assures her, another mysterious voice or feeling or whatever telling her that maybe it’s what Rio needs to hear. “Or if you…can’t…talk. I understood you just fine with a gag in your mouth,” she reminds her, moving down to slip her pants down her legs.</p><p>Rio takes a deep, forced breath — something Agatha appreciates.</p><p>“You’re doing so well,” she praises, which was pretty true, all things considered. And also something Rio seemed to like to hear, albeit in a much different and more fun context than this.</p><p>Agatha hooks her fingers into the waistband of her underwear, though she stops and looks at her face before she moves them. “Still okay?”</p><p>One, two, three more forced breaths before another tiny nod.</p><p>“We can keep them on if you’d prefer,” Agatha adds at the hesitation. “It’s really not a big deal either way. Do you want to leave them?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “I want my whole body clean from him,” she manages to say.</p><p>“Okay,” she agrees. “That’s okay, too.” She shifts them down past her knees and over her ankles before placing her hands on her waist and slowly helping her into the tub. “There you go.”</p><p>Rio grabs a washcloth, immediately squeezing on some body wash and scrubbing away at her skin. Agatha stands there for a moment, feeling uncharacteristically awkward and weirdly out of place despite the fact she was paying for this bathroom, for fuck’s sake.</p><p>After a beat, she lowers herself to sit on the edge of the tub. “Would it be okay if I washed your hair again?” It really was mostly for her own benefit. She needs another physical task, and she still probably had a few minutes before the food would be there and she could go get it.</p><p>Rio nods without ceasing, shoulders seeming to relax the smallest bit at the inquiry. It had calmed her the other night, after all. </p><p>Agatha knows she should probably chide her for scrubbing so damn hard, but it’s not like she doesn’t understand the instinct — to crawl out of your skin or do the next best thing and peel it off layer by layer — and nothing is bleeding, at least. Instead, she makes sure her own touch is exceptionally gentle as she cups some water to pour onto her head and begins to massage in some shampoo.</p><p>“I didn’t…put the pieces together,” Agatha says a few moments into lathering her hair.</p><p>Rio’s brow wrinkles the smallest bit as she looks back at her. She manages a strained, “Hm?” </p><p>“The reactions you had. The…autism you mentioned,” she says, voice matter-of-fact. “I didn’t grow up with any of that stuff. My mother was an adamant denier that it even existed.”</p><p>Rio gives a half nod, clearly trying not to disturb Agatha’s hands — thinking of everyone else, even in this movement. She finally puts the washcloth down, busying herself with picking at a hangnail instead. “It’s okay,” she says after a long moment. “I’m weird.”</p><p>“You are,” Agatha confirms. “But not because of that. The doctors said Nicky might be, too.”</p><p>“Makes sense.” Another long pause. “You probably are, too, then. Genetics.”</p><p>“Mm. Autism is usually inherited from the father,” Agatha points out.</p><p>“Not always.”</p><p>“Believe it or not, that’s why I said ‘usually.’ Why are you so certain I’m the culprit, hm?”</p><p>“Ask me later.”</p><p>Agatha should respect her wishes in her condition, but two of her most dominant characteristics are curiosity and impatience. “Oh, come on,” she baits. “You can’t leave me hanging like that. Give me the short of it, at least. The bullet points.”</p><p>Rio gathers a deep breath. “Rigidity,” she finally says. “Black-and-white thinking. Low emotional intelligence. Bluntness.”</p><p>She had a point with the emotions. And the bluntness. The other two, however… “I think I’m extremely flexible,” Agatha counters. “And that everything about me is grey.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head, though it’s clear she doesn’t have the energy to elaborate. Agatha puts a pin in it for later and simply gives a little hum in response.</p><p>Just then, there’s a knock on the door. </p><p>“The food,” Agatha muses. “I have to go get that — I don’t want Nicky answering it.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispers with a little nod.</p><p>“I’ll be back,” she promises. “Don’t drown.”</p><p>“Mama,” Nicky says the moment Agatha opens the door from her bedroom. He wisely stays on the couch just as she’d instructed. </p><p>“Hi, sweetheart. Did you talk to your mom?” </p><p>“Yeah. She says she misses me.” </p><p>Agatha is glad he doesn’t elaborate about the bitch on the other end of the line. She also feels a little smug about the fact Wanda had to settle for the occasional phone call right now. That was usually what she had to do. “I’ll bet.” </p><p>She opens the door to get their cart of food, making sure not to tip once she sees it’s the waiter from the previous night delivering it.  </p><p>“How are you feeling?” Agatha asks once the door is relocked. She’s confident she could take Thanos if he were to get in, but still. She’d prefer to do the ambushing, not be the one ambushed. Plus, Nicky was in the room, and she'd be damned if he got near him again. </p><p>“Good,” Nicky says. “Better.” </p><p>“I’m glad to hear that.” Agatha goes to hand him the ice cream, keeping her fingers around the bowl as he reaches for it. “Are you just saying that because you want to go to the pool later?” She looks him in the eyes. </p><p>“No.” A small cough. </p><p>She raises a brow. “No?” </p><p>“That wasn’t a real cough!” he insists. “I promise!” </p><p>“Mhm.” She lets go of the bowl. “Will you be all right if I go check on Ms. Rio again?” </p><p>“Is she okay?” Nicky asks, concern pooling in his pupils. Her sweet, sweet boy.</p><p>“She’s fine. Just taking a bath. I was helping her wash her hair.” </p><p>“You’re good at that,” Nicky muses with a serious nod. Agatha breathes out a small, almost touched laugh. “I’ll be fine, Mama. I’m six now,” he insists.</p><p>“All right, all right — I forgot you were all grown up.” She lifts her palms and goes to retrieve Rio’s toast and smoothie.</p><p>“You’re eating at least half of this,” she announces without room for argument as she strides back into the bathroom. “And drinking the entire thing.”</p><p>“Drink first,” Rio replies in a reluctant mumble.</p><p>Agatha places the cup on the side of the tub, positioning the straw to her lips before cutting the avocado toast into smaller pieces. It was maybe vaguely disgusting to be eating in a bathroom, but housekeeping came every day, and they did a damn good job.</p><p>“Be careful,” she orders as she brings the plate over. “The thought of you bathing in soggy breadcrumbs makes me want to puke. Although knowing this ritzy ass place, that’s probably one of the bizarre fucking spa treatments they offer."</p><p>The corner of Rio’s mouth quirks into a tiny smile as she picks up a piece of the toast. </p><p>“The dumb fucking waiter dropped it off,” Agatha continues. “You should’ve seen his face — I think he almost pissed himself when he realized it was me.”</p><p>She’s upgraded from a small smile to a brief, hollow huff of laughter.</p><p>“Tough crowd,” Agatha muses.</p><p>“I’m tired,” Rio defends.</p><p>“And I’m funny.”</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio replies, noncommittal.</p><p>“I’m <em> very </em> funny,” she reiterates.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. She's trying to stall the inevitable, but Rio’s clearly not in the mood. She imagines she’ll be even less in the mood for what she asks next, but she has to rip the bandaid sometime. </p><p>“What’s the plan here, Rio? I don’t mean to overwhelm you even more than you are, but it is…more urgent than it was, all things considered.”</p><p>Rio swallows the bite of toast she’s chewing and takes a sip of smoothie before she responds. “I’m gonna go get my stuff today, then…I’ll figure it out from there.”</p><p>“You’re going to get your stuff and you’re going to put it…where exactly?”</p><p>Rio looks at her. “Here?” she asks, voice so quiet it’s barely audible. “Please?”</p><p>Agatha takes a breath, considering. “Does he know where my room is?”</p><p>Rio gives her head a vehement shake. “No.”</p><p>“You’re absolutely positive? I can’t have Nicky in danger, Rio. I won’t.”</p><p>“I never told him,” Rio promises. “I never would.”</p><p>Another deep breath. “All right. Here, then. For tonight, at least. Just in case — with the drugs and all.” Is it an excuse to keep Rio close? Maybe, partially, it is. Does Agatha care? Maybe, partially, she doesn’t.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio replies, shoulders relaxing down another inch. She finishes her smoothie, holding the empty cup up as if presenting evidence. “Can I rest now?”</p><p>Agatha raises a brow, looking at the still nearly full plate. “That’s not half the toast. I definitely said half the toast.”</p><p>“It's a third.”</p><p>“Which is very much not what I said.”</p><p>Rio sticks her bottom lip out, pouting, but Agatha holds firm. “I told you that look doesn’t work on me. Come on.” She gestures toward the plate.</p><p>Rio grumbles a few choice words under her breath before reluctantly complying.</p><p>“Good girl.” Agatha pats her head, her tone some mix of playful condescension and affection.</p><p>It’s slightly less than half if they’re getting all technical, but Agatha lets it slide once she takes a few more bites. “Give me the rest,” she orders, opening her own mouth. In all the chaos, she hadn’t thought to order anything for herself (which was a first), and it was approximately $30, which was fucking outrageous. Thanks again, Sharon Davis, for footing the bill.</p><p>Rio obliges, holding up a piece. Agatha leans forward, taking a large bite.</p><p>“Mm,” she says as she chews. “I feel like Cleopatra.”</p><p>“You’re pretty like her,” Rio muses.</p><p>“That’s why you said I was like Gaea, too.”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“I feel objectified."</p><p>Rio pouts once more.</p><p>“Don’t you know the definition of insanity?” Agatha asks.</p><p>Rio continues to pout, though she raises her hand out of the water in order to flash her a middle finger. </p><p>“Aww, there you go — that’s something new. Something that might actually get you a different result.”</p><p>Rio raises an expectant eyebrow, causing Agatha to blink in surprise. Did she really want to…do something? Right now? Would it even be responsible for Agatha to indulge it with Rio in her state and Nicky awake and right outside the door?</p><p>“What kind of reaction did you <em>want</em> that to get you?” Agatha asks. It’s…a strategic question at the moment.</p><p>Rio thinks for a long, long beat. “I just want to rest,” she finally admits.</p><p>Agatha softens. “Okay, sweetheart — you can rest now. Do you want to borrow some more comfortable clothes?”</p><p>Rio rapidly nods as if the thought of putting on anything he’d touched — anything he’d even seen her in — was too much to bear. “Please.”</p><p>“Give me a minute,” Agatha says before disappearing to her closet. She returns a few moments later with some fleece shorts, a t-shirt with a design Rio can’t yet see, and a faintly mischievous smirk on her face.</p><p>“What’s that look for?” Rio asks as she towels off.</p><p>“I’ve brought you the best of the best,” she says, turning the shirt to reveal a truly ridiculous design: BOHNER FAMILY REUNION — it reads in red-and-green letters around a campsite design — PITCH A TENT!</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio says, managing a full laugh this time. “What’s the story?”</p><p>“Stupid-ass ex’s stupid-ass brother made us all go camping. Do I look like a person who enjoys fucking camping?” she asks, tossing her the clothes.</p><p>Rio shakes her head, a small smile still on her face as she pulls it over her head.</p><p>Agatha leads her back to the bed more slowly than what’s probably strictly necessary — she really does not want her slipping and cracking her head on that damn tub — and slides in beside her so they’re lying face-to-face.</p><p>Rio scoots close the second she does, immediately burying her face in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>They’re interrupted by a shy little knock on the door. “Shit,” Agatha mutters under her breath. Then, louder, “What is it, bud?” </p><p>“Can I open the door?” Nicky asks meekly. </p><p>Agatha sighs. “Are you okay if he comes in?” she whispers.</p><p>Rio nods against her chest before pulling her head back slightly to look at the doorway.</p><p>“You can open it,” Agatha announces. Nicky turns the handle slowly and creaks it even slower. “What’s wrong, my love?”</p><p>“Tummy hurts.”  </p><p>“Did you eat the ice cream too fast?” He looks down at his feet. “Nicky..." she warns. "We talked about this.”</p><p>“I’m sorryyy.” He gives her a pathetic little look. “Can I have a sandwich?” </p><p>“You <em> just </em> said your stomach hurts.” </p><p>“Not the eat kind. The lie-down kind.” And by that, he means he wants to lie all cozy between them. Wanda had coined the term. Dumb bitch. “I’ll be quiet and not bother you even at all,” he promises.</p><p>Agatha looks at Rio. “Are you okay if he rests with us if he’s <em>very calm and quiet</em>?” she interprets, emphasizing the last words.</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio nods again. “Of course.”</p><p>“Come on, then,” Agatha tells Nicky, pulling the blankets back in invitation. </p><p>The little boy quickly pads over to the bed, climbing in from the end and squeezing himself in the middle of them.</p><p>Rio manages a smile — weak but sincere — before she closes her eyes again. Nicky follows suit shortly after, naturally snuggling into Rio in his slumber. </p><p>Agatha feels her heart ache as she looks at them both, picturing a future that almost certainly could never come to fruition.</p>

<p>Rio drifts off immediately and sleeps hard — the kind of slumber that only comes from pure, bone-deep exhaustion.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, doesn’t sleep at all, staying awake for the next...hour? Two? Three? She’s not entirely sure, the whole situation blurring into a haze. All she knows is it’s well into the afternoon when Rio finally opens her eyes again and groggily mumbles, “Agatha?”</p><p>“That’s my name — don’t wear it out.” A beat. “Scratch that. I like the way it sounds when you say it. How are you feeling?"</p><p>Rio presses the heels of her hands into her eyes. “Good. I’m still tired, but I feel…better.”</p><p>“I’m glad. The little human heating pad probably helped a bit.” She lightly scratches her nails on a still-sleeping Nicky’s scalp.</p><p>“Probably. How is he?”</p><p>“Oh, he’s fine. He’ll be fine.” Agatha nods, now running a hand through his locks.</p><p>“That’s good. I’m glad."</p><p>She takes a deep breath. “Okay, I think we’ve pretty much exhausted our small talk, sweetheart."</p><p>Rio looks down at the blankets, picking at a loose thread dangling off the sheets. “What do you want to talk about?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes briefly flicker down at Nicky — a silent warning to be careful what she said just in case he awoke. “When do you want to get your things?”</p><p>She shrugs a shoulder. “I can go now if you want.”</p><p>“I don’t <em> want </em> you to do it at all, but you seem to think a passport is important.”</p><p>“Well, I <em> do </em> need to reenter the United States, Agatha.”</p><p>“Shithole country,” Agatha mutters. “And there are very much ways to do that without a passport — they just require some creativity.”</p><p>Rio gives her a look. “I don’t think I have the energy for creativity right now.”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips. “Do you have a tracking app on his phone?”</p><p>“No.” She glances down again, wrapping the thread around her finger so tight the tip goes pale. “He was too stupid to figure out how that worked. Double-edged sword, obviously.” </p><p>“So you don’t know if he’ll be there,” Agatha muses, chewing on the inside of her cheek. “I don’t want you confronting him alone, Rio. That’s a supremely stupid idea.”</p><p>“I know it is.” She glances at the clock on the nightstand. “Though, I think he was supposed to be on some dumb yacht right now.”</p><p>“I don’t care. I don’t want you to risk it.”</p><p>Rio sighs. “I have to go get my stuff.”</p><p>“I’ll go with you,” Agatha offers. Any other time, she’d be positively humiliated at how desperate she sounds. At how…frightened she is, deep down. “I just don’t want to wake Nicky or have him wake up and freak out because I’m not here.”</p><p>“It’s okay, Agatha,” Rio assures her. “You stay. It’ll only take a minute, and I’ll have you on speed dial in case anything happens.”</p><p>There’s a long, long beat. It’s not right. Agatha can’t explain it, but something about this is not right. It made all the logical sense in the world, and yet. And yet. And yet.</p><p>“I don’t feel good about this, Rio,” Agatha admits, voice uncharacteristically soft.</p><p>“It’ll be all right.” She untangles herself from Nicky, swinging her legs over the side of the bed. “I’ll be back before you know it.”</p><p>“Rio—” Agatha sighs, running a hand over her face. Part of her is willing Nicky to wake up if only so there would be an interruption to distract Rio from this suicide mission she seemed hellbent on going on, but he doesn’t stir. He doesn't make a peep. He gets the sleep he needs. “Just…just wait for me, for fuck’s sake. Please. For my own sanity.”</p><p>Rio looks at her, eyes pleading. “I just want to get this over with,” she whispers. “I just want to be done with him.”</p><p>“You can be done with him when I can go with you.” Agatha does not beg. Agatha does not pray. In this moment, Agatha does both.</p><p>“He’ll be back by four,” Rio says, glancing at the clock again. “It’s 3:30 now. Trust me, Agatha — please, I need you to trust me now.”</p><p>She purses her lips, considering. Rio was playing dirty, and they were running out of time. She considers waking Nicky herself, but he’d almost certainly have questions and need reassurance — eat up more precious seconds from this rare window. </p><p>“If you’re not back here by 3:55, I’m going to your room and busting the goddamn door down,” Agatha warns. “Be fast and be careful.”</p><p>“I will.” Rio nods, slipping on her sandals. “I promise.”</p><p>Agatha is not going to say ‘I love you,’ even if they’re the first words that pop into her brain for some fucking reason. She’s not going to say ‘I love you,’ even if she’s starting to think it may be true. Because that was crazy. She’d known her for less than a week.  </p><p>She’s not going to say ‘I love you.’ She’s just fucking not. </p><p>“Hurry,” she reiterates instead.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispers. “Okay.”</p><hr><p>Rio does three things on the walk back to her room. She clutches her phone tight in her hand, Agatha’s contact pulled up — her own better version of her keys slotted between her knuckles. She walks with her shoulders squared and her head held high — the posture she always adopts to enter a courtroom. And she tells herself that he will not be there — that he will be on the boat like he’s supposed to be.</p><p>But despite this — and despite her reassurances to Agatha — the short journey feels like a death march.</p><p>She is surprised but also not when she opens the door to see him sitting on the bed, an X-rated movie playing on the TV, a laptop perched in his lap, and at least a dozen alcohol bottles littering the side table, residual white powder amongst it. “I told you you’d be back,” he says with a dark chuckle. “You barely even lasted five hours. Fucking pathetic.”</p><p>“I’m just getting my stuff,” she says, forcing herself to not even spare him a glance — a power move but also an efficient one. She grabs her passport from the pocket of his suitcase before sliding it into her own, along with some clothes she manages to haphazardly stuff into it. She’s not even sure why she’s packing them — they didn’t fucking matter, in the grand scheme of things — but she’s already here, and it’s sort of the principal of it. He didn’t get to enjoy any trace of her. “I told you: I don’t want you,” she says, shutting the bag with a definitive zip.</p><p>She goes through a mental checklist in her head: passport, clothes, computer…computer…where had she put her computer? It wasn’t on the desk where she thought she left it, but it wasn’t in her laptop bag either…</p><p>"Because you're a filthy fucking dyke?” he asks. “That's the only explanation. Oh, and I have evidence. You love evidence, don't you, counselor?" </p><p>She doesn’t find her computer because it’s on his lap, her iMessages pulled up. “‘Hey, hot stuff,’” he reads. “‘You left something in my room.’ ‘I know. He couldn’t see the evidence. Plus, I thought you would enjoy it.’”</p><p>Rio’s blood runs cold — an old instinct, an old reaction. She freezes. She had been caught. She had been caught, and that was fucking terrifying. This was the worst thing that could happen.</p><p>Rio’s blood runs cold, and then it runs very, very hot — a newer instinct but an even older one, too. One she had before Thanos had happened to her. One that had reappeared after Agatha did.</p><p>She fumes. She had been caught. And so what? And so fucking what? Agatha was the best thing to ever come into her life.</p><p>She glares at him with the intensity of a thousand burning suns. “Give me my shit.”</p><p>“Actually, it’s <em>my</em> shit — I fucking paid for it,” he argues before going back to reading. “‘Both are hot. At least with you in mind.’ ‘Makes sense.’ ‘You’re hot. What can I say?’”</p><p>He’s trying to embarrass her. She will not let it embarrass her. She will not let him take this from her, too. He could have her and her dignity and her body, but he could not have Agatha.</p><p>“No, actually, you didn’t — I paid for that laptop before we were married, you stupid fucking asshole.”</p><p>“Well, I paid for the fucking room it’s currently in. And considering you’re standing in it, I guess that means I own you, too.”  </p><p>“You’re <em> renting </em> the room. Your analogy is as dumb as you are.”</p><p>Thanos ignores her. He takes a swig of gin and tonic, looking at the screen once more. “‘What else do you want to hear?’ ‘Your moaning was rather nice last night.’ ‘We can arrange that again.’” He tilts his head thoughtfully, wagging a finger at the laptop. “See, I always knew you were a cheating little bitch, but the <em> carpet muncher </em> thing...”</p><p>Rio doesn’t justify that with a verbal response. Instead, she swiftly grabs the computer off his lap and snaps it shut.</p><p>With her still feeling some effects of being drugged against her will and him drunk and drugged very much by choice, they’re on a slightly more level playing field than usual, though he is still much bigger and stronger. His reflexes are sloppy, but he does manage to snatch the laptop back and throw it across the room, it smashing into the sliding door to the balcony, before doing the same with her phone.</p><p>She flinches at the noise, but unlike the glass, she doesn’t break. “You’re such an asshole,” she mumbles. It was annoying, to be sure — she had a lot of shit on that computer and phone — but she could buy new ones. She turns on her heel, freedom so close she can taste it. It tasted like ocean air and all the chicken parmesan she could eat and Agatha.</p><p>He manages to get to her suitcase before she does, immediately fishing out the passport in a rare display of intelligence and holding it above his head. With his other, he reaches for her neck, though instead of grabbing her throat, he rips the necklace she’s wearing — a relatively inexpensive but sentimental piece her father had gotten her for her quinceañera — easily breaking the chain and holding it in his fist. “Cheap piece of shit. You <em> and </em> the fucking necklace.”</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Rio snarls, hand instinctively going to her now bare neck. She won’t cry. She can’t cry. After a moment of shock, she snaps back into action, grabbing at the arm holding her passport and twisting it with all her might. She’d never really understood that phrase before — seeing red — but her vision is all crimson now.</p><p>He throws her off of him easily, sending her flying backward against the tub in the corner of the room, before grabbing a lighter next to the heart-shaped candle on the ledge and holding the corner of her passport to it.</p><p>Adrenaline pumps hard and loud through her veins, masking some of the pain she’s sure she’d feel otherwise. It’s enough to help push herself back up and bring her knee as hard as she can into his groin.</p><p>“Ow! Jesus <em>fuck</em>,” he hisses, dropping the lighter and passport to the ground. </p><p>Thankfully, the lighter flips off, not setting the room ablaze. Even more thankfully, she manages to snatch the passport up and shove it deep into the pocket of her shorts.</p><p>“Help!” she yells as she begins to run to the door. “Fire!” </p><p>“Always so dramatic,” Thanos grumbles as he stands, grabbing the collar of her Bohner Family Reunion shirt and yanking her back hard. “Where the fuck do you think you’re going?”</p><p>Rio answers by screaming at the top of her lungs and hoping to god the walls are thinner than she thinks. She kicks back frantically, eventually finding a kneecap, though it only makes him tighten his grip on the fabric. It starts to rip in the struggle, but he manages to make her lose her balance in the process, sending her to the ground once more. He drops to his knees, pinning her to the floor.</p><p>“Not so tough now, are you?” he asks, breathing out another menacing laugh.</p><p>Rio absolutely refuses to go out like this — by his hand and in a shirt that says Bohner on it. She desperately reaches out to her side, managing to grab the lighter before flicking it on and holding it to his neck.</p><p>“Ow!” He cries out again, holding a palm to the burn. She uses his recoil as a chance to scramble up and away once again. “You stupid fucking cunt.” He pushes himself up, grabbing at the closest thing — the lamp from the side table — and chucking it as hard as he can at her retreating figure.</p><p>It hits her calf — enough to make her stumble, enough for her to feel a rush of sticky blood burst from it — though thankfully, her brain is working overtime, allowing her to then reach down and grab it as an impromptu weapon.</p><p>He throws the alarm clock as well. A vase with a bouquet of roses. Another candle. Anything he can get his hands on, charging toward her all the while.</p><p>The clock and vase she can avoid, but she makes the mistake of briefly turning to see what she’s up against, causing the candle to hit her square in the gut. She winces, folding over a little and faltering just enough to let him reach her.</p><p>He drags her back into the room by her hair before shoving her against the wall. He sneers as his hand does wrap around her throat now, squeezing hard. “If I can’t have you, nobody can.”</p><p>This is it. This can’t be it. This has to be it.</p><p>Rio thrashes, hitting and kicking and fighting like she never has before — giving it all she has. <em>Finally</em>, she thinks to herself, <em>all of those stupid hours in the gym are paying off.</em></p><p>God, her head hurts. Her throat hurts. Everything hurts. </p><p>Maybe it’s two seconds after he begins choking her, or maybe it’s two minutes or two hours or two days. Maybe she’s blinded by rage and the drugs that he fed her, or maybe this is as clear as she’s ever been. Maybe it was never supposed to end like this, or maybe it always was. She doesn’t know.</p><p>All she knows is she swings up with the bottom of the lamp as hard as she can. All she knows is she hears a dull thud and then a sharp crack as it makes contact with the back of his skull. All she knows is she will never forget that sound as long as she lives.</p><p>His grip suddenly gets loose, his eyes growing wide and panicked for a moment as he looks at her with…fear. That’s what this feeling is. He inflicted it often, experienced it never, but something is wrong. Something is very wrong. “What did you do?” he whispers before sinking to the ground. “Rio, what did you do?”</p><p>It’s almost cartoonish, the way he drops to the floor — propped against the ridiculous heart-shaped tub.</p><p>Rio collapses a moment later, beginning to cry like she never has before. She goes to clutch the necklace her dad gave her, crying harder when she realizes it’s not there.</p><p>She can barely crawl over to her now-cracked phone and dial the emergency number, the way her hands are shaking. The people on the other end of the line can barely understand her, the way she’s sobbing. She did this so she could live, but right now, she wants to die.</p><p>She sends Agatha a text — three words. Not the three words she wanted to say to Agatha but three words nonetheless: <em>You were right. </em></p>

<span>AGATHA HARKNESS [3:46pm] </span>
<em>
<span>What do you mean I was right? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>AGATHA HARKNESS [3:46pm] </span>
<em>
<span>Hello? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>AGATHA HARKNESS [3:47pm] </span>
<em>
<span>Rio? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>AGATHA HARKNESS [3:47pm] </span>
<em>
<span>Rio, answer me. Now. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>AGATHA HARKNESS [3:48pm] </span>
<em>
<span>What happened?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>At 3:49, Agatha calls her. So what if it’s only been three minutes since the first text? So what if it’s still six minutes from when she threatened to let herself in? A lot could happen in three minutes. A lot more could happen in six. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pick up,” Agatha mutters as she holds the phone to her ear. She’s pacing around the living room now, leaving Nicky to slumber away in blissful ignorance — the way it should be. The only thing going right at the moment. “Pick up, goddamn it. <em>Pick up</em>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio answers on the third ring. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thank fucking god. She’d breathe a sigh of relief if Rio sounded even marginally coherent at the moment. But she doesn’t. She sounds like she’s just been hit by a bus and then run over by a train and then lit on fire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha responds as calmly and evenly as possible — trying to balance out her decidedly uncalm energy. “I need you to tell me what the hell is going on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There are a few desperate, shaky breaths. “Dead,” she finally manages.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sucks in a sharp inhale — some may even call it a gasp — but recovers quickly. “Did you—?” ‘Kill him’ goes unspoken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had to!” Rio defends. “He— he— he attacked me! That’s what— that’s what I told them!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay — calm down.” Rio seems to forget that Agatha didn’t actually give a fuck about this man. In fact, she hopes it was a slow and painful process. “Who do you mean by ‘them’? You called the cops?” That’s the thing she was really judging her for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not—” she hiccups “—getting arrested for murder, Agatha,” she winces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, she sure the fuck hoped not, but she didn’t trust the police. She rubs a hand over her face. “What exactly did you tell them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That he attacked me. That it was self-defense. There are witnesses to corroborate my story. You and— and the people at breakfast. They must have seen something,” she desperately lists. “And physical evidence. If they examine me. The drugs and— and— and the…the way he....even though I took a bath, I think…” She can’t finish her sentence, but Agatha doesn’t need her to. Some things are just too awful to speak aloud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha really wishes Rio was thinking like a lawyer right now. Thanos’ lawyer, to be more exact. That man was rich and powerful, and he would remain rich and powerful even in death. They would bring up the fact that she was Latina, that she was queer, that she was cheating — cheating with a criminal like Agatha — and they would twist it. That’s how they operated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha really wishes Rio would have just called her first. They could’ve thought of a lie together. A story to better protect her. He made a bad investment and jumped off the balcony. He caught wind that was being investigated for fraud and fled Sicily to god knows where. He went for a swim and got lost at sea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But that’s not where they were. Rio’s fatal flaw — her inclination to be honest — had reared its ugly head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be right there,” Agatha quietly assures her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After waking Nicky and doing a lot of soothing and apologizing — she promises that Ms. Rio is going to be just fine and that the two of them will go to the pool later and get even more ice cream for dessert — she makes her way to Rio’s room, her heart pounding to the rhythm of her quick footsteps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stops short of Rio’s door, the kooky, curly-haired woman she recognizes from their boat ride to the resort in front of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I help you?” Agatha snaps at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard her screaming. Do you know what happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t see how that’s any of your business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The old woman scoffs, crossing her arms. “She was yelling for help! I’m worried for her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, go be worried from a distance, you nosy bitch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus Christ.” The woman rolls her eyes. “Do at least keep me updated,” she requests, going back into her room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can watch the news like everybody else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door is locked, of course — automatic for the resort — meaning Agatha has to knock. “Rio,” she says, knuckles tapping the wood. “It’s me. Let me in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It takes Rio a few moments, considering she literally crawls to the entrance — evident by the fact she’s on her knees as she slowly turns the handle and pushes it open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It feels like some kind of twisted game show. Right behind door #1 is…the woman you might love battered within an inch of her life — a dark bruise around her neck, a bloody gash on her calf. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t feel guilt, but she’s flooded with it right now. Agatha doesn’t take responsibility, but it’s all her fault. It’s all her fucking fault. She wasn’t there. She should’ve been there. She had a bad feeling. Agatha doesn’t apologize, but— </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” she whispers, unable to stop her voice from shaking with sadness and shame alike. “I’m so sorry, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio whimpers as she glances up, a fresh round of tears welling in her eyes. She raises a weak arm, beckoning Agatha to hold her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For once, Agatha doesn’t argue. Doesn’t let herself think about what this kind of innocent intimacy might mean. She just steps inside and lets the door close behind her before dropping down to the floor and pulling her close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio buries her face against her, still shaking as shock courses through her body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay,” Agatha soothes. “It’s okay,” she lies. It wasn’t okay. Not one tiny fucking part of this was okay. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes drift over to Thanos. To his lifeless body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had been in the room with a corpse before — her mother’s corpse. It made her feel so light and so heavy all at once. So relieved and haunted at the same time. There are some things you just don’t forget. The sound of someone hitting the ground, taking their last breaths. The smell of blood in the air. The look of vacant eyes. No matter how much they deserved it, it stayed with you. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay,” she repeats for her own sake as much as Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Scared,” Rio mutters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to be scared anymore,” she comforts, running a hand through her hair. “He’s gone, okay? It’s over. It’s over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t…I don’t know what to do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s not sure if she means that in a literal short-term sense or a longer existential one. Considering she can only answer the former, that’s exactly what she does. “They’ll probably come take your statement. Get you some medical treatment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know the drill.” Rio nods against her. “Statement. Rape kit. Tox screen. Preventative antibiotics. Fluids. I’ve seen it before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too. I loved watching </span>
<em>
<span>SVU</span>
</em>
<span> marathons when I was pregnant with Nicky,” Agatha says, attempting a little dark humor, though it </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> the truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio either doesn’t find it funny or doesn’t have the energy to laugh. Maybe both. “Before I did human rights specifically, I did stuff like this. It got to be too much, so I switched. It’s—” Rio takes a deep breath. Speaking was a currently large mountain she was valiantly attempting to climb. “I told you — I have witnesses to the drugging, to the way he pulled me around. Defensive wounds that multiple professionals can attest to. I screamed for help, so someone could have heard me—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your temporary neighbor,” Agatha confirms. “She was listening outside the door like a fucking freak.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raises her head to give her a chastising look. “Don’t be so harsh on her. I doubt she literally had her ear up to the door. I spoke to her a few times, and she seemed sweet — a little strange, maybe, but nice. Plus, it’s good for me — for someone to attest to the fact that I was screaming bloody—” She stops herself from saying it. ‘Bloody murder.’ A bit too on the nose. “—that I was screaming as loudly as I could,” she amends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” Agatha says, easily dismissing all of this logic. “I thought she was a crackpot even before she played bouncer outside your room. She looks like the type to own a different crystal ball for each day of the week and howl at the moon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe not howl at the moon because she’s…you know…a human being? Not a wild animal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, but woo woo people like that are so in touch with nature or whatever the fuck that the lines get blurred.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s frowns. “Now you’re just being mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m always just being mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not to me,” Rio argues. “I want soft Agatha right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re getting her. Your batty neighbor’s the one getting bitch Agatha. I can multitask.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grumbles, shifting in her arms. “Then hold me tighter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Forgive me for trying to be gentle at your husband’s crime scene.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat as Rio’s mouth becomes a thin line. “He’s not that anymore. He’s dead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s…true,” Agatha relents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another beat. “And it was horrifying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am sorry about that,” Agatha says, voice growing softer and more sincere again. “It should’ve happened on your timeline. On your terms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods a little. “I wish it had.” She takes a deep breath — something Agatha is eternally grateful for. Her track record with that — with oxygen — wasn’t exactly stellar. “I’m tired. It’s all so much. Too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s about to be more, but Agatha doesn’t have the heart to tell her that. Death was devastating when you loved someone, but it was complicated when you didn’t. Especially when everyone expected you to be devastated. Expected you to love them. Blamed you for protecting yourself. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But she was still your mother, Agatha — she gave birth to you, raised you. You knew she was fragile; why did you have to argue with her? But he was still your husband, Rio — he married you, provided for you. You knew he was jealous; why did you have to push his buttons?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She snapped out of her thoughts by a wince. “My body hurts,” Rio admits. “I didn’t really feel it until now. Did he…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did he what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio purses her lips. “I don’t want to look,” she whispers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“<em>I</em> will look. What are you asking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How…how badly did he hurt me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs. “Your calf is cut — I’m not sure if it’ll need stitches. Your neck is bruised, though I’m not sure there’s a whole lot they can do about that besides some painkillers. That’s all I could see with your clothes on. If you want me to look under them, I’m happy to.” For once, there’s no suggestion or innuendo in the comment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Rio shakes her head. “That’s okay. The doctors will have to. Will you stay with me while they do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All right,” she finds herself agreeing. “I’m not sure if they’ll want to do that or take your statement first. And I’m not sure they’ll let me be there for that part.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay. I’m just anxious." Rio chews on the inside of her cheek. “I hate that I'm so anxious,” she quietly admits.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean…this is presumably your first homicide, no?” she rationalizes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, and technically legally speaking it wasn’t a homicide because it was self-defense,” Rio clarifies. As if Agatha gives a shit. As if Agatha wasn’t the one who suggested she kill him in cold blood multiple times. She should save it for the cops.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just meant that…the first time for anything can be scary — killing someone included. Maybe even especially.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just so…” Rio pauses, searching for the words. “I heard his body hit the ground, and I can’t…stop…hearing it. I keep hearing it, and I keep feeling his hands on me — feeling what he did — but it’s all so past tense and removed that it doesn’t feel like me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think that’s probably your brain’s sort of fucked-up way of protecting you,” Agatha reasons. She sounds like her dumbass court-ordered therapist, and she hates it. But Rio doesn’t seem to, and she supposes that’s all that matters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess,” Rio concedes. “I just…I hate it all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re free from the immediate physical threat of them. That’s one thing to not hate, hopefully.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she agrees. “I’m just…I don’t know…nervous,” she repeats.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs. She had very little patience for circles. They were inefficient and ineffective. She wanted to cut right through the middle of them — get to the core. “What, exactly, are you afraid of?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nuh-uh.” Agatha shakes her head. “Specifics.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thinks for a moment. “The nightmares,” she finally says. “The flashbacks. Him haunting me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well…” Agatha struggles for an answer. “You believe in therapy, so…you could try that. And I bet your weird-ass neighbor has some sage to help keep the evil spirits away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods. “But I’m also afraid of the uncertainty — of not knowing where I’m supposed to go from here.” She looks down. “I’m scared…I’m scared that you might decide I’m not worth it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha purses her lips, quiet for a few long moments. She can’t imagine a future where she’ll ever decide that — Rio not being worth it. But she can’t imagine a future where she doesn’t fuck it up either — do something to make Rio realize it’s Agatha who's never been worth it at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m still here, aren’t I?” she finally says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glances up at her. “Yeah,” she replies. “Yeah, you’re still here.” She looks back down, takes another breath. “I never asked, where do you live?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jersey. Westview. I mentioned it during our…second conversation.” Agatha was incredibly good at that — filing the little details away. She’s had to be. “You never did tell me where you do, though. Just that you’re originally from Puerto Rico.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Brooklyn,” Rio answers. “So not that far, but…I don't know. I might move after this. I sure as hell don’t want to live in that apartment anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slowly nods. “Brooklyn’s overpriced as fuck, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio meets her gaze again. “Do you think maybe I could…stay with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opens her mouth to respond despite not knowing what the fuck is going to come out of it. But before she can find out, the universe (merciful, for once) intervenes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A team of cops and medical personnel burst into the room, erupting it into chaos — mirroring exactly how Agatha feels on the inside.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha should go back to Nicky, even though — according to the live stream she has set up on her phone — he’s perfectly fine, obliviously watching <em> Dora the Explorer </em>with his stuffed rabbit perched beside him.  </p><p>Agatha <em> wants </em> to go back to Nicky. Her perfect Nicky. She wants to see his sweet little face, hug his tiny little body, hear his beautiful little voice. No matter what Agatha was going through, Nicky always made it…maybe not okay but worth it. He made life worth living. </p><p>Agatha can’t go back to Nicky. Not like this. Not in the state she's currently in. She doesn’t want him to see her like this — all…all…triggered, some dumbass therapist Agatha very much did not believe in would say. Traumatized. They loved those stupid fucking buzzwords that meant jack shit. </p><p>So instead, she smokes in the hallway. Paces Rio’s floor. The environment is almost ominously normal despite the fact it's a crime scene. Despite the fact there’d been a death in it not an hour prior. The resort was obviously trying to keep it hush-hush. Death was bad for business, after all.  </p><p>She smokes and she paces and then, when the weirdo fucking neighbor’s door opens, she curses into the air. “Didn’t I tell you to just watch the news?”</p><p>“Oh, you can fuck right off,” the woman retorts. “How’s the young woman doing? Not well, from the looks of it. You’re out here stress smoking — looking brittle as a twig.”</p><p>“You’re one to talk, you frail-ass, old-ass bag of bones.”</p><p>The old, curly-haired woman shakes her head. “I see right through the act, you know. You’re pretending to be tough, but you’re a feral animal — lashing out because you’re afraid. Now answer my goddamn question.”</p><p>Agatha is most certainly not about to give her <em> that </em> satisfaction — especially after the feral animal callout that felt a little too accurate. “What kind of animal?” she inquires, blowing out a stream of smoke. Her hand was shaking a bit, which was annoying as fuck. “Like what species?”</p><p>“Answer my question, or I will find the girl myself.” The woman crosses her arms, face contorting in a smug expression. “Very well could distress her, and we wouldn’t want that, hm?”</p><p>“She’s in an ambulance,” Agatha snaps. “You know, being checked out by medical professionals?” She scoffs, taking another puff as she scans her patterned muumuu, her chunky handmade jewelry. “You probably don’t. You look like the kind of person who doesn’t believe in vaccines.”</p><p>“Oh, shut your big, overcompensating mouth — you know what they say about assumptions. Medical science and spirituality can and do coexist, not that it’s any of your business.”</p><p>“Okay, so wait — let me just get this straight: <em>your</em> view on vaccines is none of <em>my</em> business, but what happened to the woman next door <em>is</em> yours?” Agatha narrows her eyes, pointing her cigarette at the woman. “Hmm...I’m not quite sure I’m following that particular line of logic.”</p><p>The woman promptly ignores her. “I see the crime scene tape. I can draw certain conclusions—”</p><p>“I thought you didn’t like those. I thought drawing conclusions made you an ass.”</p><p>She’s stalling, of course. She doesn’t want to tell her about Rio. Doesn’t want to tell her about any of the emotions that Rio — that Rio’s situation — stirred up in her. The memories and feelings she’d long buried that it unearthed. </p><p>“What’s an old woman like you doing here anyway?” Agatha asks. “Nursing home excursion?”</p><p>“I’m connecting to my heritage.”</p><p>Agatha quirks a brow. “You’re Sicilian?”</p><p>“Yes, and you’re deflecting.”</p><p>She huffs, eyes scanning the hall — kids in water wings and influencers in sunglasses leisurely strolling down it. She’s not airing Rio’s business out here. </p><p>Agatha pushes past the woman, inviting herself into her hotel room and walking straight to her mini bar.</p><p>“It’s mostly empty,” the woman warns, shockingly unfazed. “All that’s left is cheap wine.”</p><p>Agatha opens the tiny fridge door, nose wrinkling as she confirms the woman’s words. “Gross.”  She promptly shuts it once more and puts her cigarette out in the ashtray before taking another from her purse. Not the first time this trip she was left wanting for alcohol and resorting to nicotine instead.</p><p>“Those are horseshit,” the woman says, digging around her tote before tossing her a different pack. “I’m Lilia. Now tell me what the fuck is going on.”</p><p>She blinks but manages to catch the box of Platinum Kols. Agatha much preferred Marlboro Reds, but after a beat of consideration, she drops her own pack back into her purse and fishes one out from the container the woman — Lilia, apparently — had tossed to her. Agatha wasn’t in the habit of turning down free stuff. </p><p>“Her husband was an abusive piece of shit,” Agatha says, flicking her lighter on and holding the cigarette to it. “He is no longer a piece of shit because he is also no longer breathing.”</p><p>“Huh.” Lilia softens a bit. “Well, I’m glad to hear that — men like him deserve worse than what he probably got. How do you know her?”</p><p>She shrugs. “Met her here a few days ago.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>Agatha gives her a look. “What do you mean ‘and’? That’s the full answer to the question.”</p><p>“I’m not stupid. You’re attached, or you wouldn’t be so mean and defensive.”</p><p>“Patently false. I’m always mean and defensive. It’s, like, my whole thing.”</p><p>“Not with her.” Lilia shakes her head. “I saw you two at dinner the other night.”</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms, feeling uncharacteristically vulnerable. “What are you, a spy? Are you <em> his </em> fucking spy?”</p><p>Lilia scoffs. “Paranoid much?”</p><p>“Well, can you blame me for being a little paranoid right now?” she snaps.</p><p>Lilia throws up her hands. “About what? From the sounds of it, he was your run-of-the-mill man. Barbaric? Yes. Smart enough for espionage? No.”</p><p>“You don’t have to be smart to be dangerous. And you don’t have to be a man either,” Agatha spits. She immediately wishes she hadn’t. That was a whole can of worms she’d just cracked open — given the chance to crawl out.</p><p>Lilia softens once more. “I know.” There’s a beat as she scans Agatha up and down. “Shit mom?”</p><p>Agatha considers for a moment before plopping down onto Lilia’s couch, her legs beginning to feel as shaky as her hands. “No,” she says. At least her voice was staying even — for now, at least. “No mom. She’s also no longer breathing.”</p><p>“But she was awful,” she notes. A statement — not a question.</p><p>“So fucking what?” she replies. She hates this. Hates the way the mommy issues radiate off her. Hates that the bitch is still haunting her in death. “That has nothing to do with anything.”</p><p>“It has everything to do with your reaction.” Lilia sighs, sitting on the chair across from her. “I’m curious about you and that woman because it was clear — even before I got confirmation — that he wasn’t good to her. I could see it in her body language. Now, I don’t know her well, but she seemed sweet, and the idea of her being with someone who doesn’t care for her doesn’t sit well with me.”</p><p>Agatha looks down at her lap — cracks her knuckles between her knees. “She’s not <em>with</em> me — we’re not <em>together</em> — but obviously, I…care about her. Or I wouldn’t be here.”</p><p>“Do you want to be with her?”</p><p>“It’s really not that simple.”</p><p>“That question is. Do you want to be with her?”</p><p>Agatha glances up at her then. “It is really. Not. That simple,” she repeats through gritted teeth.</p><p>It usually <em> was </em> that simple. Usually, Agatha went after whatever the hell she wanted. Usually, she acted on whatever the hell she felt. Usually, she was selfish and impulsive. </p><p>But usually, Agatha didn’t hold her hookups while they cried. Usually, she didn’t let them sleep over. Usually, she didn’t let them meet her child. Nothing about this — about Rio — was usual.</p><p>“Why is it not?” Lilia presses.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know — maybe because she just killed her husband? And I killed my mother? And frequently want to kill my ex-wife and a large percentage of the population?”</p><p>“Okay. But do you want to be with her?” she repeats.</p><p>God, she was relentless. She was effortlessly typing in the nuclear codes to make Agatha explode. “It doesn’t fucking matter — I’m not the kind of person she needs.”</p><p>Lilia tilts her head, calm as can be. Infuriating bitch. “And what do you mean by that?</p><p>“Fucking hell, lady — how dense can you be? I’m not a good person!” she blurts. “I’m not good enough for her!”</p><p>“Good and bad aren’t black and white,” Lilia counters. “Nor are they set in stone. Be better with her. Be better <em> for </em> her. And regardless of your opinion, she may want you.”</p><p>“Wow.” Agatha breathes out a humorless laugh. “You know, you’re even more delusional than I initially thought, and that’s <em> really </em> saying something.”</p><p>“Have you even asked her what she wants? Have you even tried not being someone you so clearly despise deep down under this phony exterior?”</p><p>“Of course, I’ve tried,” she hisses. “I’m not capable. I’ve never been capable.”</p><p>“You are,” Lilia argues, voice even but firm. “And I don’t say this to give you false hope — because I don’t do that shit. People who can’t change don’t even think about it. They don’t hate that they can’t. They don’t loathe themselves underneath their bravado. They don’t have a bravado — that’s just who they are. Yours? Yours is bravado.”</p><p>Agatha shoots daggers at her. She hates this woman. She hates how persistent and obnoxious and presumptuous and optimistic and…right…she is. About the bravado, at least. About the loathing. Agatha hates that this woman can see her. Agatha did not give this woman permission to see her. </p><p>“You don’t know me,” she accuses anyway. Because that much was true. Agatha was still a fundamentally bad person, and there was no fixing that. Nobody had ever been able to pray or beat or starve the badness out of her, no matter how hard they tried. “And I don’t know who the hell you think you are.”</p><p>Lilia scoffs, lifting her chin. “I’m pretty damn smart is what I am. Like I said, you’re a wounded animal lashing out. But that cage you’re trapped in? You put it there yourself. You need to woman up, find the key, and break out so you can be the person that girl deserves.”</p><p>“I can’t be the fucking person she deserves! Just like I couldn’t be the fucking daughter my mother hoped for! Or the fucking wife my ex wanted! Or the fucking mom my son needs!” </p><p>Agatha’s pretty sure she can physically feel fire coming out of her eyes in the intense glare she gives Lilia, but then she realizes that — fuck — those are tears. Those are tears because she’s about to cry. </p><p>She’s sure as shit not about to cry in here, though.</p><p>She pushes herself up and charges toward the sliding glass door, ripping it open and stepping onto the balcony. She grasps at the ledge overlooking the beach, gasping in the fresh sea air.</p><p>Lilia follows behind a few seconds later. “You tell yourself all of that now, but the fact that you’re so worried about it tells me everything I need to know about who you are deep down — about who you have the potential to be.”</p><p>“Jesus, take a hint,” Agatha growls. “I clearly want to be alone, and it’s not like I’m about to fucking jump.”</p><p>“You’re ashamed that you’re crying.”</p><p>“I’m not crying. Get your eyes checked, old lady.”</p><p>“I’m very right, and you’re very upset. Touch your own face, you dumb bitch — you’ll find tears.”</p><p>Agatha does touch her face, harshly swiping it in an attempt to clear it of any tears. She is a dumb bitch. And she is very upset because of it. “I let her go there alone,” she whimpers, voice finally cracking.</p><p>“But she survived,” Lilia says more gently than before. “She’s still here, and she needs you now.”</p><p>“It’s all my fault,” Agatha whispers, taking a shuddering breath. “It’s all my fucking fault.”</p><p>“How could that be true, hm?”</p><p>“I should have come with her. I should have protected her.”</p><p>A tiny wince escapes Agatha’s throat as she squeezes her eyes shut, thinking of Nicky — how tiny he was when he was born. How wrong it looked, seeing him hooked up to all those machines. Wailing all alone in that hospital room as the doctors ran tests, Agatha helpless on the other side of the window. She couldn’t even hold him. Agatha could never protect anyone.</p><p>“You have a chance to do that now,” Lilia reasons. “The active threat, so to speak, may be neutralized, but she’s still got a long road ahead of her.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “I’ll only make it worse.”</p><p>“You don’t know that. And only <em> she </em> can decide that. Would you rather not try and hurt her more by running off?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha hisses, looking over at her again. “Yes, because it will hurt her less in the long run.”</p><p>“You don’t know that. Again, you need to stop with these asinine assumptions.”</p><p>“There’s fucking heaps of evidence to suggest this.”</p><p>“Evidence isn’t always damning,” Lilia counters.</p><p>“No, but you’d be an idiot not to see the pattern and draw the conclusions I have.”</p><p>“Either way, she deserves support,” Lilia rationalizes. “And she clearly wants it from you if she called you right after it happened.”</p><p>“That <em> phone call </em> is not the piece of damning evidence <em> you </em> think it is — she doesn’t know anyone else on this fucking island.”</p><p>“She could have called reception.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes at her. Is silent for a beat. “It’s weird that you never asked how.”</p><p>“How what?”</p><p>“How I killed my mother. People usually ask for the gory details, but you didn’t flinch. You didn’t even bat an eye.”</p><p>Lilia shrugs. “It’s in the past. It clearly haunts you. No need for me to press for details.”</p><p>“You’re not curious? You don’t want to know if it was on purpose? If it was justified?”</p><p>Another shrug. “Honestly, I’m more concerned with making sure you get your head out of your ass.”</p><p>She crosses her arms, chews on the inside of her cheek, uncomfortable with this…lack of prying. Of judgment. Of…fear. “It was a heart attack.”</p><p>Lilia blinks. “Okay. Now can we talk about how you’re going to stop being a coward?”</p><p>“I was 17,” Agatha continues. She wants to make her stop. She wants to scare her away. She wants to make her understand that she is not meant to have someone like Rio. “Just days away from being able to leave her fucking house and never go back. I tried to run away at least once a month from the time I could walk. In all honesty, I probably tried before that — attempted to crawl away. She caught me sleeping with another girl — she was one of those religious types, you know — and raged so hard she dropped dead right there. Right on my bedroom floor.”</p><p>Lilia blinks again, maybe slightly more distributed this time. “Well, that’s horrible. But it’s still not relevant to this situation.”</p><p>“I pissed her off on purpose,” she keeps going. She’s not sure she’s ever said this aloud. She’s not entirely sure why she’s saying it now. “Constantly. Raged at her right back. Screamed at her until she fell and kept screaming as she convulsed there. I’m not even the one who called the ambulance — the girl I was fucking did. The whole world told me I should feel sorry. I didn’t feel sorry. I <em> don’t </em> feel sorry. I’m not a good person, Lilia.”</p><p>She has the fleeting thought that Lilia might try to hug her. She’s not sure what she would do. If she’d push her off the balcony or if she’d let it happen. If she’d like it a little more than she’d hate it.</p><p>Lilia doesn’t hug her, but she does place a gentle hand on her forearm. “You couldn’t control the fact that her body gave out. Couldn’t control the way she treated you.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t lean into the touch, but she doesn’t shrug her hand off either. Instead, she simply looks down at it as if it’s foreign. Because it is. It’s quite foreign to Agatha.  </p><p>“I couldn’t control it,” she softly agrees. She feels herself take a shaky breath, feels the snot blocking her nose. “I couldn’t control it,” she repeats. Nobody ever trusted that. That it wasn’t on purpose. That it was a weight off her shoulders, but it wasn’t on purpose.</p><p>“I know. I believe you.”</p><p>More tears. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. “Okay.”</p><p>Lilia’s thumb rubs gentle circles on her skin. “What you <em> can </em> control is what happens now. You can choose how you behave going forward.”</p><p>Another sniffle. “Talking about my behavior. What are you, my mother?” she halfheartedly snarks. But she’s not. She’s shown more compassion for Agatha in 18 minutes than Evanora did in 18 years.</p><p>Lilia snorts. “I’m just trying to drive some sense into your thick skull.”</p><p>“My skull is perfect just like the rest of me,” Agatha replies, finally looking up at her. “I don’t know how long all this will take. I can’t just leave my son alone.”</p><p>“I’ll check on him,” Lilia offers. “Or he can stay with one of the paramedics — I’m sure they’d watch him.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha shakes her head. “No, he doesn’t like doctors, and I want to keep him as far away from all this as possible.” </p><p>Agatha purses her lips, looking at Lilia closely. She was a stranger — and a weird one at that — but Agatha…trusts…her for some reason. Innately trusts her like Rio seems to trust Agatha. </p><p>“Would you just…would you sit with him in the room?” Agatha asks. “Maybe take him to the pool. I…promised him he could go. If he starts coughing, you just need to pat his back, put on his PEP mask. It’s not complicated, and he knows how to use it. Just don’t let him take it off too early. Or overexert himself. Or—“</p><p>“I will,” Lilia cuts her off. “But do tell me your name first. And his.”</p><p>She takes a deep inhale, lets out something like a sigh. “I’m Agatha."</p><p>Lilia nods. "Agatha."</p><p>"His name is Nicky — he’s six. If he gets so much as a scratch in your care, I’ll make you wish you were Rio’s husband.”</p><p>“I take care of my great-niece often. He’ll be okay.”</p><p>Agatha takes her bottom lip between her teeth, considering for another moment. “My room is just downstairs — I’ll introduce you.”</p><p>“All right.” Lilia nods. “Lead the way.”</p>

<p>Nicky practically leaps up from the couch when Agatha opens the door. “Mama,” he says, his little legs running to greet her. He stops short when he sees the strange woman with her. “You’re not Ms. Rio.”</p><p>“Nicky, don’t be rude,” Agatha chastises. She doesn’t know why she does. For show, maybe. She doesn’t actually give a shit, and she was about a million times ruder herself. “This is Ms. Lilia.” </p><p>“I don’t care.” The space between his brows wrinkles, and his eyes grow watery — some combination of pissed off and panicked. “Where’s Ms. Rio? I want Ms. Rio.”</p><p>Lilia crouches down so she’s at his eye level, and Nicky responds by shyly stepping to hide behind Agatha. If Lilia wasn’t doing her an enormous favor right now, Agatha would make some dig about how she better have life alert handy if she’s going to drop down to the floor like that at her ancient age. <em>Help — I’ve fallen and I can’t get up.</em></p><p>“It’s good to meet you, son,” Lilia tells him. “Ms. Rio will be back soon. She’s a little hurt right now, and your mom is going to go make sure she’s okay.”</p><p>Nicky grips onto Agatha’s pant leg and looks up at her. “I want to make sure she’s okay, too.” </p><p>Agatha sighs. “Not right now, buddy. I need you to be brave for just a little longer and stay here with Ms. Lilia, okay?” </p><p>“No,” he stubbornly insists. “I don’t want to.” </p><p>“Well, I’m very sorry to hear that, but that’s what’s happening.” </p><p>Nicky peers at Lilia. “But I don’t know her. Who even <em> is </em> she?” </p><p>Agatha does not appreciate this attitude when it’s directed at her, but it <em> is </em> sort of a valid question. “She’s…” Agatha runs a hand over her face. “She’s my friend,” she forces out, resisting the urge to throw up as she does. </p><p>Nicky gives her an odd look. “You don’t have any friends at home,” he points out.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Here, you have two.” </p><p>“I know.” </p><p>“That’s weird.”  </p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Lilia steps in, effectively ending the childish exchange. “I’m sure you can see her when she’s feeling a little better,” she reassures him. “You know how sometimes you get a paper cut on your finger or fall and skin your knee so you need a bandaid?”</p><p>Nicky nods a bit. </p><p>“Ms. Rio needs a little more than that, but it’s the same idea. The grown-ups just need some space in order to take care of her.”</p><p>“But why?” he asks earnestly. “I can help. I’m a good helper.”</p><p>“I’m sure you are,” Lilia agrees. “But she needs help from people who went to school for a long, long time.”</p><p>“I’m in first grade,” he mumbles — because that seemed like a pretty long time to him. “I did preschool <em> and </em> kindergarten <em> and </em> got all A’s.”</p><p>“And that’s wonderful, but these people have gone to medical school.”</p><p>“What grade is that?”</p><p>Lilia tilts her head a bit, considering. “Well, it’s complicated, but I suppose you could call it around 20th grade, if not higher.”</p><p>“Oh,” he says, not quite convinced but beginning to warm up to the idea. 20 <em> was </em> a pretty big number. “Do you speak Spanish, Ms. Lilia?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I don’t — but I do know Sicilian and a lot of other things. What are you interested in?”</p><p>“Mm…” he ponders. “Animals — especially bunnies and the ones in the sea. And music. And books.”</p><p>“Well, you’re in luck because I <em> also </em> happen to love animals. Do you want to go sit on the couch and tell me about your favorites?”</p><p>Nicky’s grip on Agatha’s pant leg loosens the slightest bit as she looks up at her. </p><p>“Go on,” Agatha says, giving his back a gentle nudge of permission. </p><p>His lips purse in contemplation. “Wait here. Don’t leave yet,” he orders. </p><p>Agatha lifts her palms. “All right.” </p><p>Nicky runs the few steps over to the couch, returning momentarily with his raggedy stuffed rabbit.</p><p>“Scratchy?” Agatha questions. </p><p>“For Ms. Rio,” he explains. “In case she gets scared with the doctors, too.” </p><p>Agatha softens, her heart aching in a way that’s not altogether bad. “Are you sure, buddy?” </p><p>He gives her a confident nod. “I’m sure.” </p><p>Agatha feels her eyes burn again. That just won’t do. She clears her throat, leaning down to ruffle his hair and place a lingering kiss on his forehead. “I’ll be back soon, okay? I love you,” she murmurs. </p><p>“I love you, too, Mama.”</p><p>Agatha stands, and with one last look at Lilia — some combination of gratitude and warning — she goes out to the front of the resort where the ambulance is parked.</p><hr/><p>A paramedic breathes a sigh of relief when they see Agatha approach. “Ms. Harkness? Hi. Ms. Vidal requested you ride with her to the hospital. It’s a short trip, and we said you could meet us there, but she insisted. Wouldn’t get in the ambulance without you.”</p><p>“All right.” Agatha gives them a look, her defensive mask snapped firmly back on. “Don’t get your panties in a fucking wad.”</p><p>“Um, okay…” they mumble, turning on their heel and leading Agatha to where Rio’s sitting. She’s curled up on a bench, eyes vacant and far away.</p><p>Agatha reaches down, lightly touching the top of her head. “Hi, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio blinks at the contact — nearly flinching — but once she looks up and sees who the hand belongs to, she relaxes once more, sinking into it. “Agatha,” she manages to mumble after a second. “Missed you.”</p><p>She’s not going to say she missed her, too, even if it's the truth. “I was gone for less than an hour,” she says instead. That was a truth, too.</p><p>“Missed you,” Rio repeats anyway as the bureaucracy around her begins wrapping things up. Quite literally, in fact, as they wheel out a black body bag. With a whimper, she turns her face.</p><p>Agatha sighs and strokes Rio’s hair before shooting the people wheeling Thanos out the dirtiest look she can conjure. “You couldn’t fucking wait until she was gone to do that? Bunch of fucking morons. <em>Sei un idiota</em>,” she translates in Italian — one of five phrases she learned before coming here.</p><p>Agatha looks back down at Rio, fingertips softly brushing over her bruised neck — noticeably bare. “Did the paramedics take your necklace?"</p><p>She doesn’t know the story behind it. All she knows is that it’s significantly cheaper than all of Rio’s other jewelry and that she fidgeted with it in a way she never did with her wedding ring or tennis bracelet. That it must be valuable for a non-financial reason.</p><p>This is further confirmed when Rio shakes her head, a few tears starting to fall. </p><p>“You lost it?” Agatha asks. “When did you last see it? Maybe it’s in my room.”</p><p>“He— he broke it,” she manages through heaving breaths.</p><p>“Rio, look at me.” Agatha takes her chin. “I can be pretty handy. I’m a lesbian, for fuck’s sake. Do you have it?”</p><p>Rio nods, reaching a shaky hand down to her pocket and producing the pieces.</p><p>“Oh, that’s not so bad,” she soothes as she examines it. “It’s really just the clasp. Is the chain important, too? Or just the pendant?”</p><p>“I don’t— I don’t want it to change. I’ve had it for over 20 years.”</p><p>“All right.” Agatha nods. “That’s fine. I’ll figure it out, okay?” It would take much more time and effort than simply replacing the chain, but she would figure it out. For Rio, she would. “But right now, we need to get to the hospital.”</p><p>“I know.” With no small amount of effort, she manages to push herself up and begin to walk the few steps to the ambulance. “Agatha?” She looks over her shoulder. “Come with me.”</p><p>“I’m right behind you,” she assures her. “I’m right here.”</p><p>“Promise?” </p><p>Agatha sighs. “I’m not leaving you again,” she says softly. Not now. She won’t make that mistake again.</p><p>“Please don’t.”</p><p>“Rio. I’m not,” she slowly but firmly repeats. “You trust me, remember?” And she probably shouldn’t. She definitely shouldn’t. But Rio had said that she did, and she needs to use that to her advantage right now — to calm her down.</p><p>Rio gives her a slow nod before stepping into the ambulance, forgoing the bed in the middle of it to sit on the small bench to the side instead. She scoots over, leaving space for Agatha — a spot she occupies without hesitation.</p><p>Agatha pats her leg. “Lie down on my lap. Come on.” </p><p>“That’s not really what we'd recom—" a paramedic starts.  </p><p>“It’s better than fucking nothing, isn’t it?” she snaps.</p><p>The paramedics look at each other as if to say, ‘This bitch is crazy,’ but don’t argue.</p><p>Rio adjusts herself so her head is resting on Agatha’s legs. She absentmindedly reaches up to play with one of Agatha’s hands — an action that seems to relax her. “Sorry if I’m gross. I know I need a shower."</p><p>“You’re fine, Rio,” Agatha replies, resisting the urge to scold her for the completely insane and unnecessary apology. “I should have brought you one of those little things Nicky likes to fidget with,” she muses, stroking her hair with her free hand.</p><p>“Is he okay?” Rio asks, a little guilt laced through her tone as she traces the ridge of Agatha’s knuckle.</p><p>“He’s fine. He’s…with a babysitter.”</p><p>Agatha sure as fuck doesn’t want to get into all of that right now, and luckily, Rio doesn’t press for details. After a second, she speaks again, voice even softer than before. “I'm so fucking scared, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath. "Well, actually, you're in luck. Nicky was worried you might be, so…” Agatha reaches into her purse and pulls out the stuffed rabbit. “He wanted you to borrow this to help you feel less afraid. And believe me, Rio, that’s a big fucking deal — he doesn’t go anywhere without him.”</p><p>Rio removes her hand from Agatha’s, going to fiddle with the rabbit instead. “That was sweet of him.”</p><p>“He’s basically Nicky’s version of your necklace.”</p><p>“I used to have a weighted stuffed animal,” Rio muses as she runs the rabbit’s ear through her fingers.</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>“Mhm. A shark. He thought it was stupid, so it’s been in a box in my closet for a couple of years.”</p><p>“Well, you can free him now.”</p><p>Rio looks up at her. “You don’t think it’s dumb?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “Not particularly. People do all kinds of weird shit to comfort themselves.” Agatha preferred sex, alcohol, and the occasional hard drug as a treat, but different strokes for different folks.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio replies after a moment, curling in closer. “You’re comfy.”</p><p>“So you’ve said.”</p><p>“Because it’s true.”</p><p>“You repeat yourself a lot,” she notes. “I hate repeating myself. Everyone should listen to me the first time.”</p><p>“Sometimes people are hard of hearing,” Rio counters. "Or have auditory processing issues.”</p><p>“I don’t mean them.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio blinks. “Sorry.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs again, unfazed. “It’s fine. I am a bitch in most situations, so.”</p><p>“I like you, though.”</p><p>Agatha breathes out a laugh. “That doesn’t mean I'm not a bitch.”</p><p>Rio bites her bottom lip. Agatha can practically see the wheels turning in her head, debating whether to open her mouth before she finally comes out with an, “Agatha?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Can you hold me tighter?” she requests, tone bordering on embarrassment. “I realized we’ll probably be there soon, and…yeah…” she trails off. She doesn’t need to say any more than that.</p><p>Agatha obliges. “You’ll be okay. You said you’re no stranger to doctors, right? And I’m not either. I won’t let you take any shit from them.”</p><p>“Doctors aren’t usually performing a rape kit on me,” Rio quietly admits. “That’s what I’m nervous about.”</p><p>“I can take you for ice cream after,” Agatha offers. “Would that help? That’s how I bribe Nicky.”</p><p>Rio gives her a tiny smile. “I think I just need someone to be there for me so my mind doesn’t go…places I don’t want it to.”</p><p>“Do you think I’m coming with you for the delicious hospital food, Rio?”</p><p>Her small smile grows the tiniest bit before disappearing completely, some color draining from her face. “I’m fine with cardiologists, endocrinologists, you name it, but I really, really hate OBGYNs.”</p><p>“Why is that?” Agatha asks, voice uncharacteristically soft. “I mean, besides the obvious.”</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath, looking down at the rabbit. “It was fine until we were married. Then he insisted he had to come with me. He’d make inappropriate remarks, and…touch me. When the doctor wasn’t there.”</p><p>The confession is so vile, Agatha actually feels like she might throw up. “Jesus fucking Christ, Rio.”</p><p>She blinks up at her, innocent. “What?”</p><p>“That’s supervillain shit.”</p><p>Her eyes drop back down to her hands. “Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips. “Well, I’m obviously not going to do that.”</p><p>Rio nods. “I know. Still. Scary.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replies, softly repeating her words.</p><p>Rio chews on the inside of her cheek. “Will they think it’s stupid? If I cry?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “First of all, who gives a fuck? Second of all, I think crying during a literal rape kit is probably pretty standard.”</p><p>“I guess so.” Rio pauses for a second. “What if—” She shakes her head. “No. Never mind.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “Rio, don’t do that. Come on. What were you going to say?”</p><p>After a moment of deliberation, she finishes in a small voice. “What if my birth control didn’t work?”</p><p>Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. If Agatha thought she was out of her depth before, she was <em> really </em> out of it now. She was in a leaky submarine in the deepest part of the fucking ocean out of her depth with this. “Well…you’d have options,” she says, attempting to stay as calm and logical as she can.</p><p>“I know. I wouldn’t want it. It’s just…it’s my worst nightmare.”</p><p>“Having an abortion?”</p><p>“No, being pregnant with his…thing.”</p><p>Agatha stupidly thinks back to those <em> Law &amp; Order: SVU </em> marathons. “They’ll check during the kit. And give you a morning after pill if you want it.”</p><p>“I do,” Rio says quickly. Another beat. “I hope it works.”</p><p>“It should. We’ll keep an eye on it,” Agatha slips. Because that would mean implying there would be a future off this island for them.</p><p>Rio nods and forces herself to take a deep breath. “All of the worst possibilities are flashing through my mind right now.”</p><p>“You lived through the worst for a long time, Rio,” Agatha reasons. “You can do it again.”</p><p>There’s a long, long stretch of silence before Rio replies, voice so quiet it’s barely audible, “I’m already so tired, Agatha.”</p><p>“So you rest. So you recover. So you keep going because you have to,” she says, voice firm and adamant. “He doesn’t get the satisfaction of making you give up.”</p><p>“I know,” she confirms, voice just as soft as before.</p><p>Agatha is almost grateful when they pull up to the hospital. There’s not a whole lot of time to talk there — not about anything other than her physical health, that is. Agatha knew how to handle that. A lot better than emotions, at least.</p>

<p>Between getting her blood drawn, fluids pumped into her, and her leg stitched up, Agatha is fairly certain Rio has bruised her hand from squeezing it so hard. Not that she particularly cares. She’s ready to bruise anybody a hell of a lot harder in a place a hell of a lot more painful than their hand if they so much as look at her wrong.</p><p>After all of that, as well as countless swabs — of the side of her cheek and under her nails and between her legs — and just as many silent tears from Rio, they’re finally cleared to leave the hospital. </p><p>“Is the fact that it happened here going to make things more complicated?” Agatha asks in the taxi on the way back to the resort. The driver seems to speak only Italian, which was probably a good thing — he’d make a shitty witness to their conversation. <em>Paranoid</em>, she can hear Lilia’s voice in her head. How fucking obnoxious. “International law and whatnot?”</p><p>“Possibly,” Rio admits. “But the fact we were both American citizens should make things a little simpler.”</p><p>“That’s good.” Agatha purses her lips, racking her paranoid brain. If only Rio hadn’t called the fucking cops. “Did he have family?”</p><p>Rio nods. “A mom. She’s divorced from his dad. His father wouldn’t talk to him anymore.”</p><p>“Well, his mom also won’t talk to him anymore unless she holds a seance,” Agatha mumbles. “Is she one of those godawful boy moms?” Agatha, too, could be potentially characterized as such, though she would shank anyone who dared to suggest as much. Her boy was different. Nicky could <em> actually </em> do no wrong. “You think she’ll try and fight you in court? Or…smear you in the press?”</p><p>“Press? No.” Rio shakes her head. “Court…maybe? She’s not…particularly invested in public appearances because of said messy divorce, nor does she have the money to pay for a halfway decent lawyer. She might show up and harass me, though.”</p><p>“No. She won't,” Agatha replies, voice cool and confident. She’ll make sure of that. “And she might not have the money for a half-decent lawyer now, but he was loaded. Will his money still go to you, or...?"</p><p>“I’m next of kin, so despite everything, it probably will. Plus, chances are Stark won’t want his reputation tarnished with this scandal, so he won’t dig his nose into it. He hated Thanos anyway. Only let him invest out of pity.”</p><p>“Hm.” Agatha considers. “Tony Stark having a brain cell. How unexpected.”</p><p>“Not a brain cell. An ego,” Rio corrects. </p><p>“Ah.” Agatha nods. “Yeah. Makes more sense. Arrogant bastard.”</p><p>Rio shrugs a bit. “Works in my favor now.” She’s being…oddly nonchalant about this whole thing. Agatha wonders if that’s a defense mechanism — her way of coping. Agatha doesn’t <em> not </em> relate.</p><p>“We’ll take it.” A beat. “Is there anyone else that’s likely to cause you trouble — legally, publicly, or otherwise?”</p><p>“Mm…” Rio hums, considering. “Maybe his brother?” She shakes her head. “I’m not sure. I could never figure out how Eros actually felt about anything. But he seemed…nice the few times I met him.”</p><p>“Nice like how?” she asks, suspicious. “That’s his only sibling?”</p><p>“Yeah, just the two of them. I don’t know — once, he told Thanos he shouldn’t yell at me. They almost got into a fist fight because of it.”</p><p>“You think it’s a brain cell thing or ego thing?”</p><p>“Brain cell, most likely. He’s sort of a loser but not in an incel way. He seemed…vaguely self-aware.”</p><p>“Okay, well that’s…potentially promising.” Agatha still doesn’t completely trust him or his intentions, but she hardly ever did. “Have you thought about calling your dad?” she asks more gently.</p><p>Rio purses her lips, an odd, conflicted expression crossing her face — as if she wants nothing more than to talk to him right now. As if she wants nothing less. “Maybe tomorrow.”</p><p>“Why not tonight?” Agatha presses.</p><p>“Talking’s hard. I can’t wait to stop.”</p><p>“That’s…” Concerning. A relatively unreasonable request, all things considered. “…fair enough.” </p><p>The car pulls up in front of the building, and Agatha hurries out, wordlessly going to the other side of the car to open Rio’s door and help her out. She gives her an arm for her to balance with as they walk into the building, her calf rendering mobility attainable but more difficult than normal.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio says softly, voice so touched and eyes so wide and earnest that Agatha can’t bear it.</p><p>So she doesn’t, quickly moving onto a less-than-savory but probably necessary topic.</p><p>“Oh, um — I should probably tell you. Nicky’s babysitter is…” Agatha clears her throat. “It’s your weird next-door neighbor.”</p><p>“Okaaay…” Rio flashes her an odd look but thankfully doesn’t make her relay the whole humiliating series of events that led up to it happening. “So you changed your mind about her?”</p><p>“No, but I vetted her, and she seemed a passable babysitter in a pinch,” Agatha clarifies. “She <em> is </em> also extremely annoying, though. And nosy. She knows your name now.”</p><p>“That’s okay. She’s nice.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “She’s <em>fine</em>.”</p><p>Rio shoots her another look — more scolding this time. “She’s nice. You’re not going to explode if you admit that someone’s nice.”</p><p>“I might,” Agatha argues. “You really want to take that risk?”</p><p>“Yeah, because I’m <em> that </em> confident you won’t.”</p><p>“You’re gonna feel really bad if I spontaneously combust. Leave a poor, sweet child without a mother.” It wasn’t even true — Nicky would still have Wanda if Agatha died. But ginger bitch didn’t count.</p><p>“Just fucking admit it,” Rio goads. “Your ego will be fine.”</p><p>“She was…she was…she was ni—" Agatha makes dramatic explosion noises and gestures with her free hand, causing a few people to give them odd looks as they make their way through the halls.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says, unamused.</p><p>She promptly ignores her, continuing the explosion theatrics.</p><p>Rio sighs now, running a hand across her face. “<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>“Oh, come on.” She gives her a light nudge. “You know you want to laugh. Or at the very least crack a smile.”</p><p>“And yet here I am, not laughing or smiling.”</p><p>Agatha’s bottom lip juts into a pout. “You’re gonna hurt my feelings.”</p><p>Rio stops walking and turns to Agatha, wrapping her arms around her. “Compromise.”</p><p>Agatha immediately hugs her back. She has the sneaking suspicion this was far more about Rio’s needs than her own, but at the moment, she’s happy to oblige under whatever guise Rio wanted. “Not as good for my ego, but I’ll take it.”</p><p>Rio leans against her for a long moment, melting into her touch.</p><p>“Cozying up to me after all that talk about desperately needing a shower,” Agatha notes. “Charming.”</p><p>“Just to get rid of him,” Rio clarifies, voice muffled as she buries her face into Agatha.</p><p>“I know. I know,” she assures her, running a hand through her hair. “I was just teasing.”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha feels her tense up a bit — her skin flush out of embarrassment. “Sorry.”</p><p>“It’s all right,” she assures her. “Jokes are my default in this situation.” A beat. “Most situations. Not all of them are good. I mean, <em> most </em> of them are, but occasionally, I miss.” Another beat. “That was another joke, in case that wasn’t clear.”</p><p>“Good joke or not, I’m probably gonna miss it,” Rio notes — her own attempt at humor.</p><p>Agatha pulls back to give her a small smile. “Good thing you’re pretty,” she quips.</p><p>“Am I?”</p><p>“Rio, I got two strangers on the beach to tell you that you were last night.” Last night. Jesus, had that all only been yesterday? It seems like a lifetime ago.</p><p>“But it’s your opinion I care about,” Rio insists.</p><p>“You think I’d fuck someone ugly?” Agatha scoffs. “I’m a little insulted.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio groans. “Please?”</p><p>“Please what?”</p><p>“Just be forthright for once in your life.”</p><p>“I think you’re beautiful, Rio,” Agatha says. “I think you’re on another plane of existence from most of the world.”</p><p>The corner of Rio’s mouth curves into a small smile. “It’s nice when a pretty woman thinks I’m pretty.”</p><p>“It is, isn’t it?” Agatha says, giving her a light kiss on the nose — an oddly tender action. “Are you ready to face the shitstorm that is my six-year-old and his six-hundred-year-old babysitter?” She nods toward her door.</p><p>Rio stares at it for a long moment, seemingly overwhelmed at the mere sight. “I guess so.”</p><p>“He <em> should </em> be in bed by now, but Lilia seems like a fucking pushover, and he’s been worrying about you nonstop.”</p><p>Rio shifts her gaze from the door to look at Agatha. “He was worried?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs at the understatement of the century. “He was practically inconsolable.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio blinks as if the thought of someone worrying about her — besides her father, maybe — somehow never occurred to her. “That’s sweet of him.”</p><p>“That kid adores you, Rio. I don’t think you realize how much.”</p><p>“I…appreciate it. But I don’t get why.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “You know Spanish and like his rabbit. He’s not a particularly harsh critic, really.”</p><p>“I suppose so.” Her brows furrow once more. “I just never figured kids would really like me.”</p><p>Agatha really has to stop doing that — making jokes Rio doesn’t pick up on. Especially right now. But it’s just how Agatha is wired.  </p><p>She decides not to draw attention to the missed quip. “Why? You’re great with them, and you have vaguely kindergarten teacher energy — at least in the streets.” A beat. “A very <em> sexy </em> kindergarten teacher, but still."</p><p>“Thank…you?” Rio says slowly. “I don’t know how to interpret that. Kids didn’t really like me when I was a kid, so I figured that probably wouldn’t change as an adult.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, don’t take it personally — most kids are freaks,” she replies, unlocking her hotel room. She hears Rio take a deep breath beside her — sees her attempt to plaster on a more convincing smile.</p><p>“Mama! Ms. Rio!” Nicky exclaims immediately — just as Agatha knew he would. </p><p>Agatha steps in front of Rio to intercept him if necessary. “Calm, Nicky. Be calm.”</p><p>Lilia raises an eyebrow from her place on the couch. “Nicky, I told you to what?” </p><p>He freezes before slowly — almost comically — walking backwards. “To rest quietly. Sorry, Ms. Lilia.” </p><p>Agatha blinks in surprise. How the hell had she gotten him to listen like that? Was she…was she actually a <em> good </em> babysitter?</p><p>She scoops him up, walking him back to the couch. “What did my favorite boy do today?” </p><p>“Ms. Lilia took me to the pool,” Nicky tells her. “I held my breath a long, long, long, long, <em> long </em> time.” </p><p>“Wow, that sounds fun — you’ll have to show me next time. What else?” Agatha glances over at Lilia.</p><p>“I also made sure he got some dinner in him, and we watched Animal Planet,” Lilia offers. “He told me many fish facts.”</p><p>“Daddy seahorses are the ones that have the babies,” Nicky shares. “You can tell how old a goldfish is by looking at the rings on its scales — like a tree. Dolphins sleep with one eye open.”</p><p>“So smart,” Agatha absentmindedly praises despite giving approximately zero fucks about marine life. She lowers herself onto the couch and sets him on her lap, brushing his hair away from his face. “What did you eat?” </p><p>“Spaghetti. She only let me have ice cream after I finished 10 whole bites.”</p><p>“Because it’s important to get nutrients,” Lilia explains.</p><p>“That’s true. I want you to grow big and strong. But not <em> too </em> big or <em> too </em> strong, young man.” Agatha pokes his stomach. “You take your time growing up, understand?” </p><p>“Yeah.” Nicky gives her a tiny smile, turning his head to look at Rio still standing silently in the doorway. The beautiful elephant in the room. He turns his head again — this time to whisper in Agatha’s ear. “Can she sit by me?” </p><p>Agatha cups her hand around her mouth, whispering back. “You can ask her. But be gentle, okay? She’s still feeling a little yucky.” </p><p>Nicky dutifully nods. “Ms. Rio? Do you want to come sit by me?”</p><p>“Sure,” Rio says with another smile — only half-forced. Nobody could resist Nicky. “For a little bit. But then I need to rest.”</p><p>“That’s okay. Me too,” he assures her. He frowns as she walks toward him, noticing her condition. “What happened to your leg? And your neck?” </p><p>“Nicky.” Agatha runs a hand over her face. She really should’ve specified no prying questions either. Rookie mistake. </p><p>“I thought it was her tummy that hurt.” Fuck, he was smart. Too smart. How impressive and infuriating.</p><p>“Well…” Rio gives Agatha a glance before attempting to answer the question. “I got hurt. And it was scary, but I’m safe now.”</p><p>“How?” </p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha warns.</p><p>“Did you fall down?” he presses.</p><p>Rio purses her lips — as if even the vague discussion of it is physically painful. “Someone hurt me. Please, leave it at that,” she gently but firmly pleads.</p><p>“Oh.” Nicky’s eyes grow wide and concerned. “Are they in time-out?” he whispers. </p><p>“In a way,” Agatha answers for her. “They won’t be hurting her again.” </p><p>He nods, marginally reassured by this answer. "Did…did my bunny help? At the doctor’s?”</p><p>Rio nods. “He was very soft.”</p><p>“He’s a good bunny,” Nicky agrees, his fingers fidgeting in his lap. Agatha can tell he’s anxious — that he wants him back now. </p><p>“Lilia, would you mind grabbing him out of my purse?” she requests.</p><p>Lilia wordlessly nods and goes over to the table, reaching into Agatha’s purse and retrieving the bunny — along with a crumpled-up $20 bill, which she deftly slips underneath her bangles. Frankly, Agatha would respect the hustle if she went for something bigger — a few 100s at least.</p><p>“I’ll leave you all be,” Lilia says as she walks back to the couch to hand it off. “It was nice to meet you, son.”</p><p>“You, too, Ms. Lilia,” Nicky politely replies, though Agatha can tell he means it.</p><p>Agatha takes the stuffed animal, simultaneously reaching under Lilia’s bracelets to snatch her money back, too. "Goodbye, Lilia."</p><p>Lilia scowls, “accidentally” hitting Agatha in the face with her own purse as she turns toward the door. “See you around.”</p><p>Agatha itches the side of her head with her middle finger, casually flipping her off. “Bitch,” she mutters under breath.  </p><p>“What, Mama?” </p><p>“Nothing, baby.”</p><p>The ambient sound of Animal Planet playing in the background is interrupted by the buzz of Rio’s phone — the notification she receives nothing good from the way the color drains from her face, the way tears begin to bubble in her eyes again as she types back a shaky response.</p><p>Nicky clocks it immediately. “What’s wrong, Ms. Rio?” </p><p>“Hey.” Agatha reaches out to lightly touch her leg. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio wordlessly turns the screen just enough for Agatha to see a short text exchange. The contact at the top says Papá, and it reads: <em>Mija, saw the news about a violent death in Sicily. Have you heard anything about that? Are you all right? Love and miss you. Xx</em></p><p><em>Yes, actually</em>, Rio has typed back. <em>I was involved</em>. She really wasn't one to beat around the bush.</p><p>“Shit,” Agatha mutters. “Do you need to call him?” </p><p>As if on cue, her phone rings, her father no doubt beating her to the punch. Rio lets out a nearly imperceptible whimper, unable to bring herself to answer it.</p><p>Agatha sighs, taking the phone from her hand and declining the call. She sends a text to her father: <em>I’m okay. Call you in a few.</em> </p><p>“Bedtime, Nicky,” she announces. </p><p>“But Mama—"</p><p>“No whining. You’re already way past.” </p><p>Nicky looks at Rio, eyes wide and scared. “Are you really okay?” he whispers.</p><p>Rio purses her lips, considering. She clearly doesn’t want to lie, but the truth was too awful for anyone to bear, much less a six-year-old. “I will be,” she responds after a second, voice just as quiet.</p><p>“Can I give you a hug?”</p><p>Rio nods a little. “Yes.”</p><p>“Gentle, Nicky,” Agatha cautions.</p><p>Nicky shifts, wrapping his arms around her as lightly as he can, Señor Scratchy clutched in his hand. “<em>Te amo</em>,” he tells her.</p><p>One of the tears in Rio’s eyes falls onto her cheek. She squeezes her eyes shut, presumably in the hopes of stopping any more. “<em>Y tu</em>.” </p>

<p>Agatha returns to the living room approximately three and a half lullabies later. She’s being more indulgent with Nicky than usual, feeling the slightest bit of guilt about leaving him all evening with a stranger. He’d been a trooper. He always was.</p><p>“He’s asleep,” Agatha announces. “Lilia wore him out, I think.”</p><p>It takes Rio a moment to answer. To speak. That was hard for her sometimes, Agatha had learned. “That’s good,” she finally manages.</p><p>She could try to force some more small talk, but what would be the point? Band-aids were meant for ripping. “Let’s go into my bedroom — call your dad.”</p><p>Rio looks at her, eyes wide and shining with panic. “He’ll be worried. And I don’t want him to— but I can’t— or else he—”</p><p>Agatha raises her palms. “I can do most of the talking,” she promises. “But I’m sure he’s going to want to hear your voice as proof of life.”</p><p>She sighs, looking down and squeezing her eyes shut. “Okay,” she agrees after a moment, voice barely audible.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha repeats, holding out her hand. “Come on.”</p><p>It's another beat before Rio opens her eyes, but once she does, she takes it and allows herself to be pulled up and led into the room. </p><p>“Hardest parts are over,” Agatha reassures her once they settle on the bed. “From what you told me, he’s just going to want to make sure you’re okay.”</p><p>Rio nods, which Agatha takes as permission to press the contact for her father. It doesn’t even get through an entire ring before he answers, frantic. “<em>Hija, ¿qué pasa? ¿Qué pasó? ¿Estás bien?</em>” </p><p>“Mr. Vidal,” Agatha says. It feels strange to call him that — vaguely childlike — but she realizes she doesn’t know his first name. “It’s Agatha.” </p><p>“Agatha? Who the hell is Agatha? Where’s my daughter? I need to speak to Rio. <em>Quiero hablar con mi hija</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Estoy aquí</em>,” Rio speaks up, voice small. “<em>Agatha es…una persona que yo conocí en Sicily. Ella cudia a mí mas mejor que Thanos. El es muerto. Y...por muchos años el abusó de mí. No dije nada porque estaba avergonzada. Lo siento. Thanos trató de matarme. No tengo la energía hablar ahora mucho. Lo siento. Lo siento, Papa</em>.” She manages almost in one quick breath before the tears start to fall.</p><p>Agatha can’t make all or even most of it out, but there are certain words she picks up on — a combination of the rare high school Spanish class she didn’t skip and being in the room when Nicky watched his cartoons. She knows “person” and “dead” and “I’m sorry” — she can infer “abusó” and “energía.” </p><p>Her father is quiet for a long, long moment — Agatha can’t say she blames him. “¿<em>Mi niña</em>?” he responds, so quiet and broken that Agatha feels it deep in her chest. “He was hurting you? And you didn’t feel you could—” A soft sob.</p><p>“I wanted to,” Rio chokes out, pinching her arm until blood begins to bead — no doubt in an attempt to hold back more shuddering sobs.</p><p>Agatha opens the bedside drawer, grabbing a balled-up pair of socks from it. She wordlessly removes Rio’s hand from her forearm and puts it in her palm instead. “Mr. Vidal—”</p><p>“Santos,” he says. “You can call me Santos.” </p><p>“Santos.” Agatha nods. “It’s been a long, long…long day. Perhaps Rio could rest for a bit, call you again tomorrow once she has a clearer head so you can discuss…logistics.”</p><p>“I can be on a plane in an hour,” he responds. “I can be there in…how far is it? 12 hours?”</p><p>“It’s okay, Papa,” Rio whispers. “I’m okay.”</p><p>“I don’t want you alone, <em>mija</em>. In a strange country after all that has happened…”</p><p>“I have Agatha.”</p><p>“Who is this Agatha person?” Santos asks, a bit of suspicion creeping into his voice. “Does she work at the resort?”</p><p>“No, she’s…she’s someone I met.”</p><p>“<em>Mija</em>…” he says, voice almost scolding at the vagueness.</p><p>Rio gives Agatha a look that says she’s not picking a label. Agatha stares right back. She’s not going to either, and she can play this game all day. </p><p>“Rio?” Santos speaks up. “Are you still there?” </p><p>Rio hits mute on the phone. “Agatha.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha shakes her head. “No fucking way. He’s <em>your</em> dad — <em>you</em> decide what to tell him.” She unmutes the phone.</p><p>Rio mutes it again. “Just tell me what to say.”</p><p>“No. You’re not living like that anymore — with someone putting words in your mouth.” Unmute.</p><p>Rio glares at her, gritting her teeth. “She’s— she’s my…something. She’s taking care of me.”</p><p>“She is your nurse, then? Your doctor?”</p><p>“My—? No.” Rio massages her temples. “Please, can we talk later? I promise I’m safe for tonight.”</p><p>Another long, long beat of silence. “You will call me when you wake up tomorrow? Or if you need me before then for any reason? I meant what I said — I will get on a plane, no questions asked.”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio weakly manages, nodding for…well, Agatha’s not sure whose benefit.</p><p>“Take care of my girl, Agatha,” Santos says firmly. “Whoever you are. If you hurt her more…”  </p><p>“You’ll get on a plane to chop my limbs off one by one and leave them scattered around Sicily like a bloody scavenger hunt.” </p><p>“That is…not exactly what I was going to say,” Santos says slowly, a bit taken aback. “But the sentiment, yes.” </p><p>“I figured.” Agatha would do the same for Nicky. And she’s no stranger to violent threats — unfazed at this point. </p><p>“<em>Te quiero, mija</em>,” Santos softly tells Rio.</p><p>“<em>Te quiero</em>.”</p><p>Agatha hangs up and looks at her. “See? That wasn’t so bad.” Rio shakes her head in disagreement, a fresh round of tears starting to fall. It breaks Agatha’s fucking heart every time. “What was so bad about it, hm?” she asks, cupping her face.</p><p>Rio doesn’t verbally respond, only shaking her head harder — the tears speeding up.</p><p>“Rio.” She sighs. “I get that this is hard, but I need you to at least try and communicate with me, or else I’m just going to be talking to myself. And as much as I find conversations with me highly stimulating, it’s not going to help much in this case. I know you don’t always like the verbal thing. Write it down if you’d prefer.” Agatha grabs the pad of paper and hotel pen from the side table, dropping them in front of her. Rio’s phone number is still on the top page from when she’d jotted it down next to the underwear she'd left a few nights ago.</p><p><em>Cares too much</em>, Rio writes.</p><p>“Take it from me — he can’t help how much he cares. And in my never-humble opinion, he cares exactly how much a parent should.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrows for a second before she clarifies. <em>Worries too much.</em></p><p>“Worrying is synonymous with parenting — that’s the job,” Agatha flippantly retorts. She’d learned that hard and fast with Nicky and his plethora of health problems since the moment he was born. Before it, even.</p><p>The space between Rio’s brow creases further. <em>Not about me. I’m glad he’s dead. That’s bad. I’m bad. I shouldn’t be glad someone’s dead. Even him.</em></p><p>“You’re not bad for that, do you understand me? Not in the slightest,” Agatha says firmly. She’s a hypocrite, maybe — considering everything she told Lilia about her feelings surrounding her mother’s death. But it was different. <em>Rio</em> was different. “You survived. You’re alive. You deserve to throw a fucking party right now.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head once more. <em>Everything hurts</em>.</p><p>“I didn’t mean a literal party,” Agatha clarifies. A beat. “Unless you want, I suppose. I’m sure I could bully the stupid waiter kid into more free desserts — maybe some confetti and a few balloons.”  </p><p>She’s joking again despite the fact none of her humor had seemed to land all day. She’s joking again because that’s all she knows. She’s joking again because, if she doesn’t, she might break down once more, and she wouldn’t do that in front of Rio. She couldn’t.</p><p>Rio gives her a timid shrug, setting the notepad aside before curling up and lying her head on Agatha’s lap.</p><p>She reaches down to stroke her hair. “What do you want, Rio?” she whispers. “What do you need?”</p><p>Rio closes her eyes, silent for a moment. “Just hold me,” she finally mumbles.</p><p>“Okay.” A beat. “Do you want to…do...anything else?”</p><p>Another head shake.</p><p>“You don’t want me to—” Agatha shakes her own head. Like a hypocrite. “No. Never mind. Of course, you wouldn’t right now.”</p><p>Rio turns her head to look up at her, confusion etched into her features.</p><p>“Forget it. I’m…” <em>Ashamed and humiliated for even thinking it</em>. “Please, let’s just pretend I didn’t say anything, okay?”</p><p>Rio shrinks into herself. “I'm sorry,” she mutters.</p><p>“No, don’t. Don’t be sorry. I’m…” She sighs. She’s <em>embarrassed</em> — this is <em>embarrassing</em> — but she has to explain at least a little, or Rio would continue to spiral. To blame herself. “I…tend to solve a lot of problems with sex is all. Try to, anyway.” She clears her throat. 'Hypersexuality,' one of her stupid court-ordered therapists had said, 'from childhood trauma.' Fucking idiot. She liked to fuck because it felt good — not because her mommy didn’t love her.</p><p>Rio pushes herself up a bit, reaching for the notepad again. <em>You don’t understand intimacy when it’s not rough and sexual because you didn’t experience any from a caregiver when your brain was still developing.</em></p><p>Agatha scowls — something Rio is already addressing with her next sentence. </p><p>
<em> Sorry to be clinical or whatever, but when I shut down, logic works, and that’s about it. I don’t want to have sex, but I’m not mad at you for your instinct to suggest it.  </em>
</p><p>She bristles at the words Rio writes — at the psychoanalyzing. It was vulnerable and deeply uncomfortable and she absolutely did not want to talk about it further. So she doesn’t. “We don’t have to fuck. Obviously. I would never force you. It was just…it was a dumb idea. Which is rare for me.”</p><p>
<em> Not dumb. A reaction that makes a lot of sense. Even if I don’t want to do that, I still want to be around you. </em>
</p><p>“Well, you don’t really have a choice. Your room is a crime scene at the moment.” Rio gives her a look. “What?” she questions with an innocent shrug, though she knows damn well it wasn’t the right thing to say before she even said it. The problem was, Agatha didn’t <em>know</em> the right thing to say.</p><p>
<em> Deflecting makes it obvious you’re nervous.  </em>
</p><p>“I’m not <em>nervous</em>. I’m not nervous — I’m just…well, maybe I’m not always great at staying still,” she admits. It feels like glass in her throat, admitting to not being excellent at something.</p><p><em>You’re <u>nervous</u></em>, she writes again, punctuating it with an underline and a knowing look. <em>And you can play with my hair or do whatever you need to do to stay grounded.</em></p><p>Agatha glares at her, though her fingers do begin mindlessly braiding a small section of her dark locks. Rio lets out a contented sigh, leaning back against her. That’s a good sign, Agatha thinks — her muscles relaxing.</p><p>“Did you grow up playing with dolls?” Agatha asks.</p><p>Rio makes a so-so motion with her hand. </p><p>“Hm,” she hums. “Nicky does, too. I didn’t. I ran around and made potions with shit in the backyard, much to my mother’s dismay. She used to call me a witch, and she wasn’t joking. Ironic considering I grew up in Salem of all places — somewhere those kinds of accusations got famously dicey.”</p><p>Rio nods a little, having a silent debate with herself — did movement or speech feel like the lesser of two evils right now? The latter seems to win out. “Did the potion thing, too. And everything else.”</p><p>“Meaning what? Dinosaurs? Sharks? Trains? Well, I already know it’s a yes on the sharks.”</p><p>“Yeah,” she confirms. “Dinosaurs, too.”</p><p>“But no trains,” Agatha muses. “Not big into transport, huh?”</p><p>Rio cracks a small smile — the first in a long while — and shakes her head no.</p><p>Encouraged by the grin, however minuscule, she continues on that line of questioning. “No? Not planes or boats or, I don’t know, skateboards either?”</p><p>Another head shake — and an eye-roll at the ridiculousness.</p><p>“You ever been on a motorcycle?”</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio hums, reaching for her phone. She was clearly over talking and writing by hand, so she opens her notes app and types, <em>My dad has one.</em></p><p>“Oh,” Agatha says, a little surprised and a lot impressed. She smirks, wiggling her brows. “You know, if I swung that way, I’d probably find that sexy.”</p><p>Her smile grows a bit, though she finds the energy to slap Agatha on the arm. <em>I can ride one — just never got my actual license.</em></p><p>“I can, too. And licenses are for suckers.”</p><p>
<em> And people who don’t want to get arrested.  </em>
</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “I’m not scared of the pigs.”</p><p><em>Felon disenfranchisement is a real thing</em>, Rio types, expression serious.</p><p>“I can’t believe <em>you’re</em> the one who killed someone today, and yet <em>I’m</em> the one getting lectured about the law.”</p><p>
<em> In self-defense. </em>
</p><p>“I know, angel,” Agatha relents, carding her hair through Rio’s hair. “I’m sorry. Dark humor is my default, remember?”</p><p>
<em> I know. I’m just tired. </em>
</p><p>“So sleep.”</p><p>
<em> Need to shower. </em>
</p><p>“You took a bath right before it all happened,” Agatha points out. “And you have a big ‘ole bandage on your leg that’s going to be a pain in the ass to work around. Maybe we just wait until tomorrow.”</p><p><em>I’ll change it</em>, Rio pushes back. <em>And be careful.</em></p><p>Agatha sighs. Rio was her match, stubbornness-wise. So fucking annoying. “Well, at least let me help. I actually need a shower, too, you know. And that lecture Nicky dragged me to? They went on and on about water waste. Maybe we could…conserve?” She looks at her out of the corner of her eye, gauging her comfortability with the idea.</p><p>Rio doesn’t seem bothered, simply typing, <em>Will you wash my hair?</em> </p><p>“Have I ever <em>not</em> washed your hair when you’ve bathed in this hotel room?”</p><p>Rio purses her lips, a silent, ‘No.’</p><p>“That’s what I thought.” She shifts Rio off of her in order to stand from the bed. “Come on, then.”</p><p>Once they’ve effectively waterproofed the wound, Agatha strips down immediately and without shame. She’s never been one to be shy about her body.</p><p>Rio follows suit, though her movements are slower. Much slower. More tired and self-conscious and obviously sore. There was no way she couldn’t be, after everything she’d been through.</p><p>Agatha flips the water on as Rio carefully sheds her clothes, turning the handle until steam begins to rise. She steps in first, taking Rio’s hand to help her in right after. </p><p>Their first few seconds under the water, Agatha can’t help but stare at her, watching her hair go from dark brown to fully black as the hot water drips down onto it, begins to roll down her face.</p><p>Rio tilts her head. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing." She shakes her own a little. "You’re just really beautiful,” she says softly.</p><p>“Oh.” Rio’s cheeks tinge pink, and Agatha knows it’s not from the water temperature. “Thank you,” she mutters. </p><p>“I know you don’t want to have sex, but would you be opposed to me kissing you?”</p><p>“No.” Rio shakes her head a little, managing a small but sincere smile of encouragement. “I wouldn’t.”</p><p>She lifts Rio’s chin, careful not to touch her bruised neck, and leans forward to plant a rather chaste kiss on her lips. Rio happily holds it for a long moment before burying her face in Agatha’s collarbone.</p><p>It’s a little awkward, trying to wash Rio’s hair with her resting in the crook of her neck, but not — as it turns out — actually the worst angle to work from.</p><p>“I’m definitely going to be stealing this shampoo,” Agatha says as she lathers it into Rio’s hair. “And the seasell shoaps.” She blinks. “The sheshell— <em>Fuck</em>. The sea-shell soaps,” she says slowly, pronouncing each syllable. “Jesus Christ — I feel like I just had a stroke. Try and say <em>that</em> five times fast.”</p><p>She purses her lips as Rio does not, in fact, try to say it five times fast. Agatha didn’t like silence, nor did she like heaviness, which is why she constantly tried to fill and lighten it. Rio made it challenging to do either. She couldn’t blame her, of course — especially right now — but it was…uncomfortable. It was all deeply uncomfortable.</p><p>So she just…stands there. She doesn’t like just standing there — it makes her feel…anxious and…vaguely useless — but that’s all there is to do. That’s all she can do.</p><p>After a beat, Rio pulls away and reaches up to absentmindedly play with a few strands of Agatha’s hair.</p><p>She quirks a brow. “Switching it up, hm?”</p><p>“It’s soft,” Rio notes.</p><p>“Because I don’t use any products or tools on it, including a hairbrush.”</p><p>“Let me brush it,” she requests. “I’ll be gentle.”</p><p>Agatha snorts a little. “You’re going to have your work cut out for you.”</p><p>“I know. That’s okay.”</p><p>“I’m still giving you a chance to back out.” Rio shakes her head, and Agatha shrugs. “All right — suit yourself. There may be a few rats living in there, though. Maybe even a bat or two.”</p><p>“I like rats,” Rio says, voice endearingly earnest.</p><p>She breathes out a laugh. “Of course you do. You like the things nobody else does.”</p><p>“They’re smart, clean, and sweet. No reason not to.”</p><p>Agatha was alluding to herself — to Rio liking her when few others did — but that sounded like a pathetic thing to admit. To explain aloud. “Didn’t they spread the bubonic plague?”</p><p>“Not really. They carried it, but that’s because infected fleas would bite them. They were victims, too.”</p><p>“I see.” Agatha nods. “So we should blame the fleas instead.”</p><p>“Mhm.” </p><p>“Fuck the fleas.”</p><p>“Fuck the fleas,” Rio agrees.</p><p>“What’s your position on flea circuses?”</p><p>Rio crinkles her brows. “On what?”</p><p>“You’ve never heard of flea circuses?” Agatha scoffs. “And here I thought you were an endless well of useless knowledge…”</p><p>“What the hell are they?”</p><p>She shrugs. “Exactly what they sound like. Sideshow attraction where fleas perform tricks.”</p><p>The crease between Rio’s brow deepens, unable to wrap her head around this. “Fleas are tiny, though.”</p><p>“That’s the point,” Agatha explains. “They’re attached to mini carts and canons and stuff in a confined space.”</p><p>Rio considers this for another moment. “Huh.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you didn’t know about this. I’ll show you a video of it when we get out."</p><p>Rio nods a little before leaning against Agatha one more, face pressed against her skin.</p><p>“Why do you do that?” Agatha inquires, voice free of judgment. “Act like you want to crawl inside me?”</p><p>The inside of her, Agatha knows, is rotten. Is an ugly place. She’s glad that Rio can’t actually see it, or she’d be running. If she knew what was good for her, she’d be gone.</p><p>“I just want to be close to you,” Rio whispers. </p><p>Agatha swallows back everything she’s tempted to say. “We should get out — get you some sleep.”</p><p>Rio tilts her chin just enough to peer up at her. “You’ll still be here when I wake up?”</p><p>“It is <em>my</em> room, Rio,” she says dryly.</p><p>“You know what I mean,” she grumbles.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha confirms after a beat. “I’ll still be here.” It’s a rare promise she intends to keep.</p>

<p>Rio sleeps until she doesn’t. Sleeps until she screams. And gasps for air. And desperately scrapes her throat. </p><p>Rio screams, and then Nicky screams, and, god, does it make Agatha want to scream as she’s pulled from the restless rest she’s fallen into. </p><p>She’s still groggy, but she manages to reflexively take a firm hold of Rio’s hands. Clawing at your neck was already not great, but the fact Rio’s was already bruised to shit by the attempted choking out? It was fucking dangerous. “Stop,” she says sternly. “Stop that.”</p><p>Rio tries to shrink away from Agatha’s touch, but it’s clear that — even as she manages to quit yelling her lungs out — she’s not completely lucid, attempting to rip her arms from Agatha’s grasp in a panicked daze.</p><p>“Rio, look at me,” she says, her hands still holding her wrists. “I need you to look at me.”</p><p>It takes a long, long moment for Rio to finally meet Agatha’s eyes, though once she does, something seems to click. She stops struggling, falling into her instead as she collapses into sobs. “I’m sorry,” she mutters. “It was a nightmare. I— he—”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha reassures her. “It’s okay. I have to calm Nicky down. I’ll be right back, but I need you to not hurt yourself while I’m gone, do you understand?”</p><p>Rio looks up at her, eyes frantic but serious. “I don’t want him to see me like this, Agatha. Even if he wants to talk to me—”</p><p>“That’s all right.” She understands, of course. She understands better than anyone. Avoiding Nicky for his own protection was how she got roped into a heart-to-fucking-heart with Lilia. “I’ll keep him away.” Rio nods, pulling her knees to her chest in an attempt to stop shaking. “Deep breaths, okay?” Agatha reminds her.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispers, forcing some oxygen into her lungs.</p><p>“Okay.” She pats her wrist, the action strangely tender. “I’ll just be a minute.”</p><p>Nicky is in much the same position when she comes into his room — curled up and struggling to breathe. He flinches when the door opens, burrowing further under his blankets. “It’s just me, baby,” she soothes, going to sit on the edge of his bed. “It’s just Mama.” </p><p>“Heard a— a scream. Like a scary monster attack,” he whimpers. </p><p>“I know.” She rubs his leg over the covers. “It was just Ms. Rio. She thought there was a monster, but it was all in her head.” This time, at least. The monster had been real mere hours ago — still a living, breathing thing. </p><p>Nicky peeks his head out of the blankets. “Her head?” </p><p>“Yeah. She had a nightmare. You know how sometimes you get those bad dreams? And even though they’re pretend, they feel really, really real?” </p><p>“Mhm.” He nods. “Like when I thought bunny got sucked down the bathtub drain.” </p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha confirms. “And you woke up, and bunny was perfectly fine. But it still had you a little shaken up, remember? So you came and slept in bed with me to feel better.” </p><p>“Yeah.” Nicky nods again. </p><p>“Would it be okay if I go and sleep with Ms. Rio to make her feel better?” </p><p>“Can I come?” </p><p>“I think for tonight she just needs another grown-up.” She strokes his hair. </p><p>Nicky frowns, considering, but miraculously ends up not fighting her. “Okay,” he finally agrees. </p><p>“Are you sure?” Agatha checks. “I know you’re a little scared, too. And I won’t leave you if you want me to stay.” That much was true. As much as she cared about Rio, Nicky would always, always come first. </p><p>“No.” He shakes his head. “No, it’s okay. I’m a big boy. And Ms. Rio is scareder.” </p><p>She leans down to kiss his forehead. “I’m very proud of you for being so brave. Try and get some sleep, okay?” </p><p>“Okay.” He hugs his stuffed animal close to his chest, nestling his head into the pillow once more.</p><p>Rio has mostly managed to stop shaking by the time Agatha returns after briefly disappearing into the master bathroom and coming out with a glass of water and Nicky’s hairbrush. She knows Rio’s not going to be able to go back to sleep right after that — not going to want to even try, as much as Agatha might encourage it — so she doesn’t bother. </p><p>“Here,” Agatha says, handing her both before going to sit cross-legged in front of her. “You never did brush my hair. And believe me, you want to do it while it’s still damp.”</p><p>Rio nods, clearly grateful for the distraction as she slowly pushes herself to sit up on her knees and begin combing through her tangled locks. It’s strangely nice — and strangely intimate. Agatha finds her head lolling back, her eyelids falling shut. The repetition, the promised gentleness — it’s soothing in some strange way. “Did your father used to do your hair?”</p><p>“Mhm. He learned how to for me.”</p><p>“That’s sweet." Agatha absentmindedly fiddles with the comforter. "The dads at Nicky’s school…let’s just say I’m unimpressed by their handiwork.”</p><p>“It was a little rough to start, but he got better over the years.”</p><p>“My mother had no patience for mine,” Agatha informs her. “She’d just yank the brush through as fast as she could. Hurt like shit. ‘How can someone be so hardheaded and tenderheaded at the same time? You defy everything — including logic,’” she quotes.</p><p>“What a bitch.”</p><p>“A bitch with some of the flattest, dullest hair anyone's ever seen, mind you. Thank god Nicky didn't inherit it."</p><p>The space between Rio’s brows creases. “Her hair?”</p><p>“Yeah. Sometimes those things skip a generation, and I’d kill myself if he looked anything like my mother.”</p><p>“That’s…fair.”</p><p>Agatha turns her head as if she wants to look back at her. “You think so? I sort of thought you’d say suicide wasn’t the answer to giving birth to your mother’s clone.”</p><p>“Well, it’s not, but I understand the feeling,” Rio says, sucking on the inside of her cheek.</p><p>A heavy silence hangs in the air. “The doctors didn’t see anything on the scan, Rio,” she gently assures her. “And they gave you the morning-after pill. You should be fine.”</p><p>“Doctors can be wrong,” she replies, tone stiff.</p><p>“Oh, I’m well aware of that. But they can, on occasion, be right.”</p><p>“I hope this is one of those times.”</p><p>“Yes, me too,” Agatha says, tensing the smallest bit as Rio brushes over a particularly tricky tangle. “You find any mice or fleas yet?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Pity. I’m sure Nicky would like another pet. He’s so bonded with Scratchy.”</p><p>“What’s he like?” Rio asks. “Your rabbit?”</p><p>“You’ve already met the stuffed version. Not so different, really.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“He’s soft,” Agatha explains. “Cuddly. I found him when he was smaller than my palm.”</p><p>“Well, I can’t wait to meet him.”</p><p>When does Rio expect that to be, she wonders. They still hadn’t really talked about it — where Rio would go after this. What would happen with the two of them. Rio’s question of whether she could live with Agatha in Westview had gone unanswered when the authorities and medics had busted in, and it’s hung in the air ever since.</p><p>As if on cue, she follows up. “You never answered me when I asked if I could stay with you,” Rio reminds her. As if she'd forgotten. As if she ever could.</p><p>“You are staying with me,” Agatha points out. “Right now.”</p><p>Agatha can hear the eye-roll in her voice. “You know what I mean. <em> After </em> this.” She shifts uncomfortably, cursing the fact that she was currently in Rio’s grasp — her hair in her hands. “Agatha,” Rio presses.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Answer me. We need to have this conversation.”</p><p>“At—" She glances at the clock. “—3:48 in the morning?”</p><p>“Yes, because you’re procrastinating.”</p><p>“Procrastinating?” Agatha scoffs. “It’s not a fucking English essay.”</p><p>“Fine, you don’t like that word? I’ll use another. You’re delaying. You’re stalling. You’re putting it off.”</p><p>“‘Putting it off’ is three words.”</p><p>Rio ignores the childish snark. “Let’s talk.”</p><p>Agatha presses the heel of her hands into her eyes. “Pass.”</p><p>Rio sighs. “Agatha, we have to.”</p><p>“Hear me out — what if we don’t?”</p><p>“But we <em>do</em>.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t want it to,” she rather petulantly insists. “So…that’s that.”</p><p>“It’s not about want.” Rio puts the brush down, scooting so she’s sitting in front of Agatha — looking her in the eyes. “I’m serious."</p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “I’m serious, too.”</p><p>“This isn’t an optional thing. I have to know what to tell my dad.”</p><p>“And I have to know what to tell my ex,” she counters. “Got any bright fucking ideas for that one?”</p><p>Rio shrugs a shoulder. “Tell her the truth — that you met someone you’re interested in. You can mention my complicated past if necessary, but keeping it simple is probably better.”</p><p>“It’s <em> obviously </em> going to be necessary, Rio. And she’s <em> obviously </em> going to run off and tell the state of New Jersey the second she hears — do everything she can to make my home seem like an unsafe place for a child. For <em> my </em> fucking child.”</p><p>“With what evidence? That I was abused? That I was a victim?”</p><p>“Yes, Rio. With that evidence,” Agatha finds herself snapping. Her optimism could be sweet, but it could be irritating, too. “Do you think the justice system gave a fuck when I told them I was abused by my mother, hm? That I was a victim? Spoiler alert: They didn’t. They blamed me. They blamed me for fighting back — labeled me a difficult, problematic child — and they sent me back to live with her in that hellhole over. And over. And over.”</p><p>She feels her face grow hot, her eyes grow hot, her blood grow hot. She fucking hated talking about this. She fucking hated everything about this. “No, I’m not a fancy human rights lawyer like you, and yes, I have a criminal record and a shit ton of enemies, but we are not different in their minds. You need to wake up and realize they are going to paint you as a villain anyway. A crazy, lying, cheating bitch. That’s what they <em> always </em> paint us as.” She gets up from the bed to pace and rub at her chest, trying to make the air enter her fucking lungs, goddamn it.</p><p>“I know how to win cases like this, Agatha,” Rio evenly assures her. “With the mountain of evidence that’s stacked in my favor? I’m confident I can win it. Besides, they would have to talk to Nicky before doing any of that, and he adores you and seems to at least like me. That’s not nothing.”</p><p>“Are you listening? I just told you they don’t listen to kids and what they want,” Agatha retorts. “And let’s just say you’re right and they investigate first. You know what they do in the meantime? While they’re doing that? They rip him the fuck away from me.” She presses her palm harder to her sternum, unable to catch her breath. “<em>Fuck</em>.”</p><p>“They don’t take him away unless there are any red flags in your initial evaluation,” Rio calmly explains. “I know those signs. I can teach you how to play the role of a model reformed parent. Plus, I know a judge in Jersey who usually sides with kids — an old classmate of mine. I can pull some strings to get him to preside over your case, but Agatha, you have to breathe.”</p><p>She crouches over and puts her hands on her knees. That’s what the girls on the softball team used to do when they were winded. And the track team. And the soccer team. Agatha didn’t play, of course, but she liked to watch them while smoking weed under the bleachers. “I can’t…just fucking breathe…when it comes to my kid.”</p><p>“Yes, you can,” Rio encourages. “You have to.”</p><p>“I <em>can’t</em>,” she says through gritted teeth, glaring over at her. “The thought of losing him…makes me feel…like my lungs are going to fucking explode.”</p><p>“Then you won’t lose him.”</p><p>“You don’t…fucking…know that.” She wants to continue glaring, but the pain of not being able to get proper oxygen makes her look away, squeeze her eyes shut. God, this was humiliating.</p><p>“I may be a lawyer, but I can play fucking dirty,” Rio insists.</p><p>“I wish…you’d played dirtier yesterday,” Agatha admits. “We wouldn’t…be in this situation.” With a wince and a huff, she stands up straight and goes to the bathroom to splash some water on her face.</p><p>Rio follows close behind. “We would,” she argues. “The injuries he gave me, no matter what I did, would arouse suspicion. Believe me — it’s legally safer for both of us this way.” Rio leans on the counter. “They also don’t know we’re romantically involved. You can tell your ex and the court that the relationship didn’t start until after he died.”</p><p>She glances up in order to shoot her a look in the mirror. “I’m all for some light perjury, but there are witnesses. Jen and her assistant?”</p><p>“Neither of them wants to touch this. She kept going on and on about the NDA, remember?”</p><p>“Okay, but our texts, Rio? That would never hold up.”</p><p>“The texts happened over international lines,” Rio reasons. “If both of us close them on our phones, they can’t be easily traced.”</p><p>“You don’t think that’d look extremely fucking suspicious?”</p><p>“Not if I explain I had one to communicate with my dad and you say you had one for Nicky to stay in contact with your ex. Once we’re back in the States, there would be no reason to keep them open.”</p><p>Agatha splashes another handful of water onto her face — manages to take something resembling a deep breath. She turns to face her. “You’re sure?” she pushes. “You’re absolutely fucking positive?”</p><p>“Yes. I know how these things work.” Rio stares back at her, gaze just as serious. “But to pull this off, you have to play by the rules I give you.”</p><p>Agatha bristles, the idea of going by the book downright repulsive. “I don’t play by anyone’s rules, sweetheart.”</p><p>“Well, that’s going to have to change. Do you want to win this? Or do you want to lose your son?”</p><p>Agatha clenches her jaw, eyes darkening. “Don’t fucking do that, Rio,” she practically growls. “Threaten me with him.”</p><p>Rio remains impressively calm. “It’s not a threat — it’s a legitimate question, to which I know the answer is no. So swallow your fucking pride and let me tell you what to do.”</p><p>She squares her shoulders, lifts her chin to conjure some sense of strength, of bravado, of the upper hand. As much as people loved to wax poetic about collaborating and being a team, someone always had the upper hand. Agatha always made sure it was her.</p><p>Rio raises a prompting brow. “Do we have a deal? I need a promise you won’t go rogue.”</p><p>“Then I need a promise from you that you will play as dirty as it takes,” Agatha counters. “I’m not fucking kidding, Rio. If you need to kill again for my son — hell, if you need to die for him — I expect you to do it. He is the most important person to me, and he always will be.”</p><p>The smallest flicker of hurt flashes in Rio’s eyes, though she recovers quickly. “That won’t be necessary, but sure. It’s not like I have much to live for at the moment.”</p><p>Agatha runs a hand over her face. “Well, don’t say <em> that </em> — Jesus, Rio.”</p><p>“Well, it’s true. Now, listen up—”</p><p>“It’s not true." Agatha crosses her arms. "And I’m not listening to shit until you take it back.”</p><p>“That is not how this works.”</p><p>“It is, actually, how it’s going to work right now,” she insists. “Try me.”</p><p>Rio massages her temples. “Agatha, do you care more about being stubborn or making a plan to save everyone in this hotel room’s ass?”</p><p>She moves her hand in a so-so motion. “It’s pretty even, honestly.”</p><p>“Stop being a petulant brat for once in your life. You can worry about my self-esteem later.”</p><p>“No, I can’t. It’s important to me now.”</p><p>Rio huffs. “I’ll let you pester me after this conversation, okay?” she tries.</p><p>“I’d like to pester you before it.”</p><p>“Too bad.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “Then I guess I’m not going to listen to you.”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flare. “Fine. I love myself, and I’m so happy to be alive,” she deadpans. “There. Now moving on—”</p><p>Agatha snorts. “You’re not winning any Oscars for that, sweetheart. Say it like you mean it.” </p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>She puts her hands over her ears. “Say it like you mean it, or I’m going to start humming really loudly to tune you out.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio sighs, her patience wearing thin. “I mean it. If you don’t stop acting like a chi—”</p><p>Agatha follows through on her promise, beginning to hum a song she and Nicky had made up on a walk one day. Rio throws her hands up in response, turning on her heel and walking out of the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha finds herself oddly stunned and…strangely hurt by the sudden abandonment. Many people had left Agatha over the years, but the fact it's Rio? It feels…different somehow. Cuts deeper.</p><p>Even more so because of the reason she’d gone. She had left not because Agatha hated her — because she had intentionally driven her away — but rather because Agatha cared about her. Cared that she felt like she was worth something in this world. Sure, she <em> was </em> being a petulant brat about it, but that was the reason she refused to move on from the conversation. It stings. And it pisses her off. So, like always, she leans into the latter.</p><p><em>Well, fine</em>, she tells herself. If Rio wants to play that game, she has no problem playing it. She wins it every time, after all.</p><p>Agatha grabs two towels — the first to ball up and use as a pillow, the second to act as a blanket — before curling up on the bathroom floor.</p><p>God, this was bullshit.</p><p>Usually, people in the doghouse at least got to sleep on the couch.</p>

<p>It’s probably fucked up for Agatha to feel like she’s won when she hears Rio’s footsteps come back into the bathroom, but there is a jolt of smug victory that runs through her. After a few beats of heavy silence, Rio finally speaks — just one word. One syllable. “Why?” </p><p>Still, the smugness doesn’t erase the bitterness. Agatha is exceptional at grudges. “Why what?” she asks. She’s on her side facing away from the door, and she makes no move to turn to face her.</p><p>“Why do you act like a child when I’m trying to help you? Why do you make it a point to remind me, in the cruelest way possible, that the most important person to you is your son? Why do you hum and lie on the bathroom floor instead of just talking to me? It’s confusing. I’m <em>confused</em>.”</p><p>“That makes two of us,” Agatha mumbles. </p><p>Rio sighs. “You hurt my feelings, Agatha. You have to start communicating — actually communicating — because it makes no sense why you would dismiss my situation, my fears, and then turn around and insist that I’m worth something.”</p><p>Agatha picks at a loose string on the towel-blanket, considering. “How did I dismiss your situation and fears?”</p><p>“Hours ago, I was almost murdered. Hours ago, I endured one of the most exhausting, terrifying things in my life. I asked if I could stay with you, and you immediately made it all about you. Did it ever occur to you that I don’t <em>want</em> to go back to the apartment I lived in with him? That I <em> can’t </em> move back in with my dad because of the location of my job? That I only asked because I thought you cared? I like to think I’m a pretty logical person. It's not like I was expecting you to move mountains for me, but you left no room for me and my feelings whatsoever.”</p><p>Another jolt runs through her — one of guilt this time. The bitterness melts into something more shameful. “I didn’t…I didn’t mean to do that,” she says softly. “I—" She rolls to look at her now. “I would help you find a new apartment. Go into your old place and pack up all your shit. Obviously, I would help you figure something out. You were never going to have to do any of it alone.”</p><p>Rio shrugs a little before crossing her arms over her chest. “Well, you didn’t make that clear. All you did was turn on me about, ‘Well, what do I say to my ex?’ Then, when I tried to reassure you, you lashed out. It was uncalled for.”</p><p>Her tongue pokes the inside of her cheek, contemplating once more. That was rare for her — thinking before she spoke. “It might be hard to believe, but I’m not exactly great at accepting help. I don’t trust my ex. I don’t trust anyone, including…” Her eyes drop back down to the floor. “…including you,” she admits.</p><p>Agatha can sense the slightest bit of hurt simmering under Rio's surface, though her tone is impressively neutral when she asks, “Why not?” </p><p>Agatha sighs. “This is going to sound like a break-up scene from an inane rom-com from 2003, but it’s not you — it’s me. I can count on half a hand the number of people I’ve truly trusted in my life. Each time, it’s backfired spectacularly."</p><p>Rio purses her lips. “I’m not going to stand here and promise I’ll never make a mistake. But what I will promise is that I would never do anything to intentionally harm you or your son.”</p><p>“Say that’s true. My life is…” Agatha shakes her head, picking at the pristine tile on the ground. “It’s extremely fucking complicated, Rio. It’s eggshells, or a house of cards, or whatever fragile analogy you want to use. I know you’re smart, and I know you’re capable, but trusting you to be able to handle all that? For you to…” She takes a deep breath. “…take the lead?”</p><p>“My life is eggshells, too,” Rio points out, going to carefully lower herself to the ground so she’s sitting across from Agatha. She manages it with only a small wince due to her slashed calf. “You don’t have to do it all at once,” she continues. “But I know how to work the system, and I know how to get things to pull in your favor.”</p><p>“The system has never once worked in my favor. No matter what way I pulled it.”</p><p>“Because you come at things with a brash, rough-and-tumble approach,” Rio notes. “Of course, it didn’t work. That never works in these situations.”</p><p>Agatha clenches her jaw. “I don’t want to be a doormat — all meek and polite.”</p><p>“Well, you have to,” Rio bluntly counters. “I need you to tone it down. No yelling, no accusations, no threats of violence. They have to see that you’re the ideal mother — that Wanda was wrong to ever question you in the first place. And if she sees you on your best behavior, surely, it’ll rile her up, which will, in turn, make her look like a bitter ex who’s upset that you moved on.”</p><p>Agatha squints. She’d never said her name. She never spoke that bitch’s name aloud. “You stalked me online.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, immediately clocking the accusation. “No, I didn’t. I saw you change the contact from ‘Ginger Bitch’ so Nicky could call. The rest of it is inferences.”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha’s mouth curves into a small, disappointed frown. “I was actually sort of flattered thinking about you sleuthing like some 15-year-old with a crush.”</p><p>“I did briefly look at your Facebook,” Rio admits. “But we can talk about that later.”</p><p>Agatha cocks a brow. “You sure you don’t want to talk about it now? Because I gotta say, I think I’d <em>really</em> love to talk about it now.”</p><p>“I’m serious,” Rio reiterates, unamused. “You have to play the ideal mother for the courts. Calm. Polite. Reformed.”</p><p>She rubs her hands over her face, already feeling a headache coming on. “Those are not words anybody has ever used to describe me.”</p><p>“Then pretend. I know what they’re going to ask. I can coach you on your answers, but you absolutely cannot tell anyone I’m doing that. You also can’t mention that I’m the one who helped find a judge who’d take the case. If they find the texts, we tell them it was flirting, fantasy — nothing real until he was gone. We end the international lines and won’t mention them unless they're brought up. They’re most likely going to ask Nicky if he feels safe with me and interrogate me if that conversation raises any red flags. We can paint your ex as vengeful — vindictive, even — to get sympathy.” Rio closes her eyes, massaging her temples. “I also need the names of both your lawyers. You should call around — chat with others in the area about the case so if she tries to switch counsel, they’ll have a conflict of interest.”</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath and lets it out slow. “Hers is Matt Murdock; mine’s Jen Walters.”</p><p>Rio nods. “Matt is good. Jen is better, though. Call her first thing when we get back to tell her about this development.”</p><p>Agatha bites the inside of her cheek so hard she tastes blood. She usually loved danger, but when it came to Nicky? All she wanted to do was keep him safe and protected and with her.</p><p>Rio opens her eyes, lifting a brow. “Agatha,” she prompts. “Are you with me?”</p><p>“It doesn’t sound like I have much of a choice.”</p><p>“Not really,” she admits. “We can do it your way, and it can all fall apart, or we can do it my way and more than likely avoid any major disasters.”</p><p>“‘More than likely’ isn’t good enough — I need certainty.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio sighs. “There are no one hundred percent guarantees, but the way I see it, these are the odds: We do it your way, and there’s about a 70% chance you lose your son and I lose my job. We do it my way, and there’s about a 90% chance everything will go off without a hitch. But in order for that 90% to <em> really be </em> 90%, you have to listen to me. Play the game.”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head. “How did you come to those numbers?” she asks, genuinely curious.</p><p>Rio shrugs. “It’s not an exact math, but I know the statistics and the complications that come up in cases like these. I also know you.”</p><p>Agatha shifts a little at that declaration — at Rio's insistence that she <em>knew her</em>. Squirms a little at the fact that it might just be the truth. "Fascinating, the way your brain works.”</p><p>“Is it?” Rio shakes her head a little before Agatha can elaborate. “We can ponder that later.”</p><p>“You love to delay my gratification, don’t you, baby?” she purrs.</p><p>“It’s healthy for the brain.” Despite the seriousness of it all, the corner of Rio’s mouth quirks into a tiny smile. “You on board?”</p><p>“If you agree that, at the very least, this gives you something to live for.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “Yes. Fine.”</p><p>“That’s a Daytime Emmy performance at best.”</p><p>“Which is better than before."</p><p>“True,” Agatha relents. “You only got a nomination, though — you didn’t win.”</p><p>“And that’s a-okay.”</p><p>“Hope you don’t take that attitude into the courtroom.”</p><p>“Oh, trust me — I don’t.”</p><p>“Bedroom either.” Agatha wiggles her brows. “When you’re ready,” she clarifies.</p><p>“Mhm.” Rio rolls her eyes once more before getting off the floor. “Speaking of the bedroom, let's get back to it. Come on — up.”</p><p>“This floor’s not so bad, actually,” Agatha says, nestling into the towel under her head. “It’s heated and everything.”</p><p>“Please? I’m injured.”</p><p>“What does that have to do with me sleeping in the bathroom?”</p><p>Rio’s bottom lip juts into a tiny pout. “The bed is comfy, and I want you to cuddle me.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “Name three things you have to live for first.”</p><p>She lets out an exasperated huff, running a hand over her face. “Agatha, I’m not doing this with you again.”</p><p>“Three things.”</p><p>She glares at her from between her fingers. “Adopting a hypothetical cat, keeping Nicky happy, and um…weed.”</p><p>Agatha thinks. “Marginally offended I didn’t make the list, but good enough.” She pushes herself up to stand.</p><p>“You were on there,” Rio confesses, suddenly self-conscious. “But I didn’t know if you’d want to be included.”</p><p>Agatha momentarily freezes, though she recovers quickly. That was…fair enough, all things considered. She clears her throat. “I want to be included,” she admits, oddly vulnerable.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>A small, nearly imperceptible nod. “Yes,” she says quietly.</p><p>“Well, rest assured, you are,” Rio says, sticking out her hand. </p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “You want to hold hands as we walk the eight steps back to bed?”</p><p>“Stop being a bitch,” she orders, grabbing her hand and yanking her back toward the bedroom.</p><p>“Bossy girl," Agatha accuses without any irritation behind her words, allowing herself to be led back. “Though I guess it makes sense considering you <em>are</em> the boss now, hm?” She sighs. “How the fuck did that happen?”</p><p>“I’m a lawyer,” Rio reasons.</p><p>“So? No lawyer has ever been the boss of me. Just ask Jen Walters.”</p><p>Rio pouts at her again. “Well, there’s a first time for everything.”</p><p>“Maybe so, but that little puppy dog face? Not really living up to the title.”</p><p>Rio shrugs. “I’m multi-faceted.”</p><p>“Ain’t that the truth,” Agatha agrees as she crawls back into bed.</p><p>“You mean that in a good way?” Rio checks as she slides under the covers, face inches from Agatha's.</p><p>She reaches out to absentmindedly tuck a stray hair, still the slightest bit damp, behind her ear. “Do I seem like someone who likes simple people, Rio?” she deadpans.</p><p>“I suppose not.”</p><p>“Exactly. You answered your own question.”</p><p>Rio nestles closer to her. “Cuddle me.”</p><p>“Ah, okay — so bossiness is back out now."</p><p>“Agatha,” she whines.</p><p>“Pouty again. You oscillate fast. It’s really quite impressive.”</p><p>“Agatha, I’m serious,” Rio says, voice growing more earnest — pleading almost — as she looks up at her. “Can you just hold me?”</p><p>“Yes," Agatha agrees as she pulls her close, relenting more easily than usual. "Yes, I’ll hold you."</p><p>She tries not to think about what that might mean.</p>

<p>
<span>Thankfully, the next time Rio stirs, the sun has finally peeked over the horizon. She briefly opens her eyes before squeezing them closed again, letting out a soft wince of pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You awake?” Agatha asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do I have to be?” Rio groans, eyes still shut.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat. “Before you ask, it wasn’t a dream,” she says quietly. “I don’t know if that’s cause for anxiety or relief.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio takes a deep breath. “Both,” she decides. “I just…don’t think I know how to keep going.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You just do, Rio. You take it hour by hour, minute by minute, second by second.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know. Logically, I know.” She sighs. “I’m just still so exhausted,” she quietly confesses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha purses her lips. She’d been saying that a lot. Too much. “What’s it going to take to get you <em>un</em>exhausted, hm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Downtime, comfort food…” Rio lists, hesitating before adding, “You.”</span>
</p><p>
<span><em>There’s time to go down on me — let me be your comfort food</em>, Agatha is tempted to say, though that’d probably be entirely inappropriate at the moment. For some reason, she cares about that right now with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she clears her throat. “Well, I’m sure we can accomplish that. We’re still at a luxury resort, after all.” She reaches over her to grab the room service menu from the bedside table. “Peruse,” she orders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally reopens her eyes, albeit with some reluctance, before scanning the menu with an equal amount of resistance. Agatha knows she didn’t necessarily mean she wanted comfort food right at this moment — knows she probably doesn’t want to eat at all — though thankfully, it’s a battle she doesn’t pick. “Waffle,” she chooses. “With fresh strawberries.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good girl.” Agatha takes the menu from her, handing her the remote now. “Peruse,” she orders again. “While I call this in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio does as she’s told once more, scanning through a few channels as Agatha dials the number. “One strawberry waffle,” she tells them, the menu fanned out in front of her. “One blueberry waffle. One with chocolate chips. And put a rush on it — there’s a </span>
<em>
<span>very special guest</span>
</em>
<span> who requires food with her medication. I will not hesitate to sue the fuck out of you if she’s not able to do so in a timely manner because of your incompetence — something you’re lucky I’m not doing already considering everything that happened on your property yesterday,” she threatens, hanging up before they have a chance to respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raises a brow when she looks up at the TV screen, seeing that Rio has settled on some movie channel playing a horror film. “Fascinating choice of comfort content, doll.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs. “I hate rom-coms, and reality TV grates on my nerves. Usually, the characters in these have even more fucked-up lives than I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That tracks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks over at her. “It does?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm,” she hums in the affirmative. “You told me that you like fucked-up shit because you’d been through fucked-up shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right.” Rio nods, shifting to curl up once more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nuh-uh,” Agatha chastises. “None of that. Food’ll be here soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can lie down until they get here,” she insists.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha doesn’t want her to fall back asleep. It’s selfish considering she could surely use some more rest. It’s even easier, frankly, not having her awake to talk about things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she doesn’t want her to fall back asleep because…well, maybe because she doesn’t want to be awake on her own. The fiercely independent Agatha afraid of being alone. Hell must be frozen the fuck over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you hate rom-coms?” Agatha asks, attempting to subtly bait her into a conversation to keep her from drifting off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I usually find them unrealistic. Cheesy. Too straight 90% of the time and too horny in the most boring ways.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As opposed to horny in an interesting way — like me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suppose so.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs. “Well, that’s not particularly reassuring. A little more enthusiasm for my sex drive would be appreciated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The corner of Rio’s mouth curves into a grin as she peers over at her. “It’s a very nice sex drive,” she admits.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks, relieved that she’d gotten Rio to crack a smile. “Well, it’s ready and waiting for you whenever you’d like to take it out of the garage again."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Soon,” Rio promises. “When my neck isn’t bruised to hell and breathing is easier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can be gentle with you, too, you know,” she says — informative but not pressuring. “I know you like me rough, but I don’t always have to be that way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, and I’ll probably need that for a while.” Rio’s face flushes with embarrassment. “It’s so stupid that I need that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not wanting to die while I’m fucking you isn’t stupid.” A beat. “I mean, it admittedly would be a pretty fucking baller way to go out, but still — nothing dumb about self-preservation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Logically, I know that, too. But it still feels…weak.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, chewing on the inside of her cheek. She could understand that. “What makes you feel strong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My job,” she replies immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Predictable but not super helpful at the moment. “What else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio considers for a few seconds. “I don’t know,” she finally admits.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on — that enormous brain is stuffed full of legal jargon and shark facts. Surely, it has more than one answer to that, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sometimes…weightlifting, I guess?” Rio says. “But that’s a no-go right now in my condition.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about when you were a child, then? Before gyms and cross-examinations?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another beat of silence. “I’m not really sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs and purses her lips. “I’m trying to help you here, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know. I know.” Rio puts a hand on her forehead, massaging her temples. “I’ve just spent the majority of my life feeling sort of…aimless. Hollow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>If they couldn’t look to the past, perhaps the answer lay in the future. “Well…is there anything you’ve always wanted to do that might help?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bites her lip, worried, maybe, that Agatha might think it’s stupid. “I’ve always wanted to swim with sharks,” she confesses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Also predictable. But also more helpful. Agatha tilts her head. “We could do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We could?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shrugs. “Why not? Nicky would lose his shit, combining two of his favorite things — sharks and swimming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bites her lip as if she doesn’t know how to react — how to act — when she gets something she wants. “I probably can’t do it today with the injuries. Maybe tomorrow, if the doctors think it would be okay.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tomorrow, then.” Agatha nods. “Pending doctoral approval.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe we could go to the aquarium today,” Rio suggests. “Get Nicky extra excited about some of the creatures he’s going to see while he’s in the water tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All right,” Agatha agrees. “But before you do anything, you need to call your father back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groans, covering her face with her hands. “Do I have to?” she whines.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Rio — you do. That poor man is in hell. If it were Nicky in your position, I’d have paddled a canoe across the fucking Atlantic last night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do I tell him you are? Friend? Girlfriend?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just…” She shakes her head, uncharacteristically flustered. “Tell him that I’m Agatha and that I bullied you in the lobby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio uncovers her eyes to give her a look. “That’s not going to fly. He’s an inquisitive man. Would you prefer I tell him the details?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“'The details' meaning that I’m drop-dead gorgeous and great in bed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re deflecting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs. “Well, what details are you referring to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That what we have is deep and real and…complicated…and messy. That I have feelings for you, and you have them for me, but that I’m scared, and you’re scared. That I trust you but can’t name exactly who you are to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lifts her chin, squares her shoulders. “Well, don’t tell him I’m scared. I wouldn’t want you to <em>lie</em> to the guy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are,” Rio insists. “Despite your posturing, despite your denial, you’re fucking terrified. Do you want me to tell him that, or do you want me to say something else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She huffs, contemplating. “Friends,” she decides. “Just say we’re friends. We’re going with the slow-burn story, aren’t we? Pretending we didn’t fuck on night two?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, yeah.” Rio nods, running a hand over her face. “That’s a good idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know me — I’m full of them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mhm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raises a brow. “That little ‘mhm’ makes me think you believe I’m full of something else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolls her eyes. “Yes, that </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> what I was implying.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you just wanted to say it then,” she deadpans. “That I’m full of shit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mhm,” Rio hums again. Infuriating little brat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrows her eyes. “Someone woke up on the wrong side of the California King.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No?” Her brow lifts again. “Because I’m sensing a bit of a ‘tude.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’m really struggling with the whole ‘wanting to be alive’ thing, so can you blame me?” Rio mumbles, deciding this is the moment she wants to busy herself with grabbing her phone and scrolling to her father’s contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinks as her head jerks back a little, surprised at the bluntness — her teasing tone promptly dropped. “Don’t even think about it, Rio,” she says firmly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio must sense this — that it was too far, too dark, too honest. She peers up from her phone, nervously attempting to backtrack. “I don’t actually want to. Or…you know, however they phrase it — I have no plans, no method. I just…I wish it a little bit is all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t care,” she says — voice serious as it’s ever been. “You’re not allowed. I’m not fucking kidding. I don’t want you even entertaining the smallest thought, do you understand?” Rio swallows hard, giving her a little nod. It’s not good enough. It’s not good enough at all. “Tell me that you understand,” Agatha demands. “Out loud.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I understand,” she mumbles, dropping her gaze back to the phone in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Agatha puts a hand under her chin, her touch gentle but insistent, and immediately tilts it back up so she’s forced to look her in the eyes. “Try again. Not even Daytime Emmy nomination worthy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>get</span>
</em>
<span> it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again. You know I can sit here all day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she pleads.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she says sternly. “I’m not playing around this time. This isn’t a game. I will not lose you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to do anything,” she insists, her voice quiet but seemingly sincere. “I can’t exactly control the thought aspect of it all — they’re called ‘intrusive’ for a reason — but I don’t plan to act on them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stares at her for a long moment before sucking her teeth and dropping Rio’s chin. “Fine,” she relents. “You better not. Nicky would never recover.” Neither would she, for that matter, but it was easier to use her son as a shield. And more effective to weaponize a child’s feelings. She nods down at the phone in Rio’s hand. “Call your father.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you stay here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to check on Nicky and get our food. Plus, I’m sure he wants to chat with you alone.” Rio gives her a look that makes it clear she’s not too keen on this idea, and Agatha sighs. “Sweetheart, trust me — I get this is a lot, but he’s going to want to talk to you by yourself. You don’t want him to resent me for playing guard dog before we even tell him our…situation, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio says nothing, but she does press the contact and hold the phone to her ear, which Agatha takes as reluctant permission to leave the room.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>He answers on the first ring, as if he’d been waiting for her to call back since the second they’d hung up. Maybe he had. “<em>Mija</em>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio takes a deep breath. “Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What— Did— How are you doing?” he settles on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m tired,” she admits, unsure how much to elaborate. Unsure how honest to really be. It hadn’t worked so great with Agatha. Had clearly concerned her quite a lot. “Really tired. But I did manage some sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s good. You need it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> rest?” she counters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat. “Yes. Yes, I managed to get a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighs. Her father is not a particularly good liar. “No, you didn’t. I promise I’m okay, but you </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> to sleep after we get off the phone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His turn to sigh. “I will try my best. I promise you that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good. Like you said, rest is important.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But my last few days haven’t been as eventful as yours, <em>mija</em>,” he gently points out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” she says, some almost teenagery irritation creeping into her tone as if he’s nagging her to clean her room or do her homework. “And I’m taking it easy — I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where? Not at that resort still I hope?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, at the resort,” she slowly admits. “I still have time off from work, and it’s not like everyone here is plotting my demise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Santos clicks his tongue in disapproval. “You should be home, <em>mija</em>. So I can look after you. Take care of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m okay. I promise,” she insists again. “I’m trying to salvage the trip as much as I can so all my PTO days aren’t wasted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio.” He breathes out a humorless laugh. “This is not healthy. Continuing to go on vacation after something like this? You need to come back. You need to heal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which I’m working on doing here. I deserve at least part of this trip not to be marred with trauma.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not saying you don’t, but don’t you think this particular trip has been marred with enough trauma already?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have two more days to make it a little better,” she stubbornly reasons. “Which I will be doing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why don’t you want to come home?” he asks, clearly trying hard to keep the hurt from his voice. “You didn’t tell me, and now you don’t want to see me — I…did I do something wrong? Am I doing something wrong? Please, just tell me if I am so I can fix it. I only want to be there for you. I only want you to be okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart can’t help but ache at that. “You didn’t do anything,” she gently reassures him. “I promise. I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want to seem weak. I didn’t want to admit that something was wrong. I didn’t want to admit that…that something was wrong with <em>me</em>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“<em>Mi niña</em>, you don’t have a weak bone in your body,” Santos whispers, though his voice is emphatic. “You’re perfect. You’ve always been just perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolls her eyes. They burn with a few tears. “You’re biased because you’re my dad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I’m </span>
<em>
<span>sure</span>
</em>
<span> because I’m your dad. Because I know you better than anyone in this world. You are much too hard on yourself. You always have been. You…you are more than I ever could have hoped for, Rio. More than I ever dreamed. And the fact he couldn’t see that — how special you were, how you deserved to be treated…” His voice cracks a bit, and he stops before it can do so again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sucks in a sharp breath. “I hate him. I really do. He tried to get me to quit my job. He controlled who I saw and who I was friends with, what I wore, what I talked about. I married him because it felt like I had to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But why did you feel you had to? You could have lived with me as long as you wanted. You could have married the garbage man. Neither would have made me think less of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bites the inside of her cheek. This is so strange, telling him all these things she’s kept bottled up for so long. All these parts of herself she’d kept secret and hidden. “I’m gay,” she admits, ripping another band-aid before she can lose her nerve. “Like…like a lesbian. I…couldn’t accept that, and I thought, if I married a man, I could pretend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It takes her father a moment to process — to wrap his head around it. “That’s okay, <em>mija</em>,” he says after a beat. “That’s perfectly all right. I love you no matter what. Did you think that I wouldn’t?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she says quickly. Was that entirely true? “Yes?” she tries, though that doesn’t feel completely right either. “I don’t know,” she admits. “I was just scared.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I understand,” he slowly admits. “The world can be unkind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm,” Rio hums in agreement. “Very.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a small beat before Santos takes a deep breath. “So this Agatha woman…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio picks at the comforter, some anxiety creeping up at the prospect of this interrogation. “What about her?” she asks as casually as possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is kind? She treats you well?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is,” Rio confirms. It was true — she was…in her own strange way. “And she does.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You met her there?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where is she from? What does she do for a living?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s from New Jersey. Mostly stays at home with her six-year-old son.” Rio is not keen on telling him that her main source of income seemed to be fraud and theft, so she grasps at the offhand comment she made about a brief stint at a hair salon. “Occasionally temps, mostly as a receptionist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Santos seems to buy it, ignoring the career portion of the answer entirely to muse, “I remember you at six.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Nicky’s a sweet kid,” Rio replies. She hopes maybe that will be the end of this particular discussion, but alas.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is all very fast, Rio. You only met her days ago…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So? We became fast friends. We have a lot in common.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Santos flatly responds, almost insulted. “Come on. I’m your father — and I was not born yesterday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you talking about?” Rio blushes, wrapping a loose string from the bedsheets around her finger. “I’m telling the truth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Half-truth,” Santos corrects. “You are not just friends. You don’t talk about her like a friend.” A beat. “You didn’t even use to talk about him like that,” he says softly. Rio can practically read his thoughts: <em>I should’ve known. How could I not have known?</em></span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t…talk about the details of it all right now,” Rio replies, getting flustered for a multitude of reasons. “It’s not you. It has to do with something on her end — something with her ex and the custody battle of it all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I understand,” he says. Rio’s sure he does. Her mother…well, she was a piece of work. “You’re positive she has good intentions?” he checks. “You have money, Rio, and you’re in a vulnerable position. This isn’t about me not trusting you — I want to be clear — it’s about me not trusting everyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m positive,” she asserts. “Truthfully, she can be kind of…” Rio searches for the nicest, cleanest word. “...brash,” she settles on. “But the way she’s helped me? I know she wouldn’t just pretend to care.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is apparently a decent justification for Santos. “All right,” he agrees — albeit a little reluctantly. “If that changes, you know you are not stuck with her, yes? That you can always leave any situation at any time and come to me. Papa will take care of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio softens once more. “I know. She’s…she’s not like him, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She better not be,” he mumbles, protectiveness flaring up once more. “When are you coming home?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“First, I’m going back to Brooklyn to get some more of my stuff — figure out my situation,” she says, dread spreading through every vein like spilled ink — a dark, consuming thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“On the same flight you had booked? Two days from now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she says slowly. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll pick you up at the airport.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to do th—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to. I’m going to,” he asserts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighs. She loves him so much. He loves her so much. And that’s why facing him was going to be…a lot. “What about work?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not the only one with vacation days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not very many. And requesting it with this short of notice? Well, his bosses weren’t going to be happy. “Dad, are you sure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m positive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He’s already made up his mind, Rio knows. There was no use arguing with him, so she doesn’t. “I’ll be okay,” she reassures him once again instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But it’s okay if you’re not right now, <em>mjia</em>. You know that, yes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She picks at the thread once more. “I…I guess so.” She doesn’t even believe herself as the words leave her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish you’d believe me.” His voice is so…sad. She hates to disappoint him, even when it comes to something like this. Hates to worry him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know I’m bad at this sort of thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I also know you can do whatever you set your mind to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mind is the enemy here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then let your heart be the hero.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio can’t help but scoff. “That’s super cheesy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Santos remains completely unfazed. “I’m your father — that’s my prerogative.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, yes,” he replies, voice solemn. “It’s in the handbook and everything. Ask your Agatha if you don’t believe me — I'm sure it’s in the mother one, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A ghost of a laugh passes her lips despite herself. “You’re so sure about that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am. I am very sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a beat of silence, which gives the seed of guilt in Rio’s chest time to blossom into a prickly, nagging thing. “How have you been, Dad?” she asks, voice soft. “Really? Are you okay? I know this is…a lot for you, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry about your old man, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I always will,” she insists. It’s the truth — they had always only had each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Worry about taking care of yourself right now. That’s the best thing you can do for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you didn’t answer,” Rio presses. “Are you doing all right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine. It’s the same old, same old here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not the full truth, but what could Rio do even if he was honest? There was no taking back what had happened — what she had divulged. “I love you,” she tells him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you, Rio. You be safe, and you call me if you need anything. Call me even if you don’t need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> call you, Dad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But can always call me more,” he says — his primary paternal grumble. “But I know you are very busy working that important job of yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fiddles with the thread again, her mind drifting to Agatha’s comment in the ambulance. Maybe a little item for her to fidget with wouldn’t be the worst investment in the world. There were a lot of things Thanos didn’t allow that might not be the worst idea. “I was thinking I might get a cat,” she says. “Might help with that work-life balance thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That could be good for you,” he agrees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are plenty in shelters that need loving homes,” she reasons, as if trying to justify it to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’d be happy to go with you while I’m visiting. If you’re ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe. If not, you’ll at least get pictures,” she vows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Send me pictures of your vacation, too, yes?” he requests. “And this Agatha woman.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vacation, yes. Agatha, no — unless she agrees.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s basically a stranger in a strange country. Please, Rio. For my sanity.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not without her consent.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He sighs. She hears a light sweeping sound as if he’s rubbing his temples. “Then at least give me her last name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio contemplates. She wants to ease his nerves, and revealing her last name doesn’t feel like a total violation of her trust. “Harkness.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And she’s from where?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you, New Jersey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More specifically. I’m sure she’s not the only Agatha Harkness in the state.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groans, decidedly not comforted by where this line of questioning is going. She’d given him an inch hoping that would be enough, but he’s clearly interested in taking a whole mile. “Don’t stalk her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to </span>
<em>
<span>stalk</span>
</em>
<span> her, Rio,” he defends. “I just want basic information in case something — in case something <em>else </em></span>
<span>— happens. It’s just a safety precaution. If you want your old man to rest…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He’s playing dirty, employing that light, paternal emotional manipulation, but Rio holds firm. “She hasn’t agreed to any of this. Pictures or information...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And if she doesn’t, that seems rather suspicious to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me remind you, she has a complicated thing going on with her ex. She’s trying to figure out what to say and what all of this means for her. She deserves that privacy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Privacy? Sure. Anonymity? Concerning. A city and a photo are both extremely reasonable asks, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re going to freak her out,” Rio argues. “Listen, I know you mean well, and I love you so much, but you have to back off this and trust me on her.” She feels her throat get unexpectedly thick, eyes burning with the first sign of tears. She just needs him to believe her. She just needs to be believed. “Please, Dad,” she whispers out a plead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a long, long beat of silence. “Okay,” he finally finds himself saying — obviously against his better judgment. “Okay. Just be careful. I’ll see you in a couple of days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a breath of relief. “I’ll see you then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you, Rio. <em>Te veo</em>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“<em>Te veo</em>, Papa.”</span>

<p>Agatha and Nicky are at the suite’s small breakfast nook cutting into their waffles — blueberry for the former, chocolate chip for the latter — when Rio limps in, wincing every few seconds. The two look up, almost creepily synchronized, when they register her presence.</p><p>“Good morning, Ms. Rio,” Nicky politely greets. Agatha is grateful that he seems to have heeded her warning to be calm and quiet around her.</p><p>“Morning,” she whispers, her forced smile not particularly convincing.</p><p>Nicky frowns, looking at Agatha in concern. Maybe it’s a little fucked up and gaslighty, but she decides the best course of action is to pretend everything is normal despite the fact that approximately zero percent of it is. “How’d it go?” she asks.</p><p>“Mm.” Rio shrugs a little as she grabs some orange juice. “Fine.”</p><p>“How did what go?” Nicky asks.</p><p>“She talked to her dad on the phone,” Agatha says. </p><p>“Oh.” He pauses for a second, racking his brain. “He's nice, isn't he?"</p><p>“He is.” Rio nods. “He’s a very good dad.”</p><p>“Was he sad that you got an ouchie?”</p><p>“Yes, very worried.”</p><p>His frown deepens, looking up at her neck before craning his head down to peer at her leg. He doesn’t notice the way Rio shuffles, no doubt feeling exposed. An injured bug under a microscope. “I’m worried, too.” </p><p>“I’ll be okay.” Rio reaches down to give his hair a reassuring ruffle before taking a seat in the chair next to him. “I’ve survived this long.”</p><p>“You’re not old, though,” Nicky argues. “Not as old as Mama, at least.” </p><p>“Hey.” Agatha thumps his shoulder. “Watch it, kid.”</p><p>“I’m only a little younger than your mom,” Rio explains. “Couple years.”</p><p><em>That’s generous</em>, Agatha thinks. She had roughly a decade on her.</p><p>Nicky, on the other hand, is about as ungenerous as they come. “One of them,” he corrects. “My other mom is younger than you, I think.” </p><p>Agatha runs a hand over her face, desperate to change the subject from her age and bitch ass ex. “Rio, why don’t you tell Nicky what we were planning to do today, hm?” she encourages.</p><p>“There’s an aquarium nearby. You want to go?” </p><p>Nicky gasps, bouncing in his chair. “Yes! Can Ms. Lilia come?” </p><p>“Can—” Agatha scowls. “What? Why do you want <em> her </em> there?” </p><p>“Because.” He shrugs. “She’s nice, and she liked it when I told her about the fish on TV.”</p><p>Agatha’s hoping Rio might intervene, say she doesn’t want extra company, but she doesn’t. She just sits there. Picking at her food. Like a traitor.</p><p>“Plus, you’re lonely—“ Nicky accuses. </p><p>“I am not,” Agatha defends. </p><p>“—and <em> she’s </em> lonely, and it’s nice to invite people to play or eat lunch when they’re all by themselves.”</p><p>Rio gives Nicky a little thumbs up at the kindness. Yup. Fucking traitor.</p><p>She gets out her phone, changing the contact from HIPPIE BITCH to LILIA before handing it to Nicky. “Call and invite her if that’s important to you.”</p><p>“Who is this person again?” Rio asks. </p><p>“Your nosy neighbor,” Agatha deadpans with a grumble. </p><p>“Oh? How did she get involved?”</p><p>Agatha gives her a funny look, opening her mouth to respond before closing it again and pursing her lips. She glances over at Nicky, who seems to be oblivious to the exchange — too busy navigating the screen. “Nicky, go call her in your bedroom, okay?” </p><p>For once, he mercifully doesn’t argue or interrogate, hopping down from his chair and putting the phone to his ear as he patters into his room. “Hi, Ms. Lilia. Yes, I slept — just like you said I should because rest is important.”</p><p>“She babysat him yesterday when I was with you at the hospital,” Agatha tells Rio, tone hushed even with Nicky in another room. “She was here when we got back. Do you…not remember?”</p><p>Rio blinks before tapping her hand to her head. “Wait, yes. Of course. Sorry. All of yesterday is just a huge blur.”</p><p>Agatha looks at her intently, eyes narrowing. “Yeah? You’re sure? It’s not — I don’t know — amnesia or something?”</p><p>“I mean, if it is, it’s the dissociative type. Neurologically, I checked out.”</p><p>She crosses her arms. “Is that supposed to make me feel better?”</p><p>Rio shrugs. “Dissociative amnesia is a lot less problematic than other types.”</p><p>She chews on the inside of her cheek. “Maybe we should have them do more scans. Those doctors yesterday were fucking idiots — they hardly did any scans.”</p><p>“I’m okay,” Rio promises, laying a hand on her arm. “Aside from my neck being bruised and the giant gash on my leg, I’m physically fine. I’ve dissociated most of my marriage — this is normal for me.”</p><p>“But it’s not <em> normal </em> in general. It shouldn’t be fucking normal.”</p><p>“Well…” Rio replies. “I don’t know what to tell you.”</p><p>Agatha tastes a little blood in her mouth, so she reluctantly removes her teeth from her cheek. “How are we going to change that, hm?”</p><p>“For starters, I’ll probably find a new therapist. One he didn’t pick.”</p><p>“He picked your—” Agatha stops herself. “Never mind. Never mind. Of course he did. More supervillain shit.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio says, much too casual for Agatha’s likening. “I mean, that’s his gig. Or was.”</p><p>“Well aware.” She peers into Nicky’s bedroom. He still seems to be talking Lilia’s ear off, which means now’s as good a time as any to broach another subject they didn’t want discussed around prying ears. “So, how’d the convo with dad actually go, hm?”</p><p>“It went okay. It was…a lot. He was obsessive about figuring out who you are.”</p><p>“And you told him what exactly?”</p><p>“Your name. State. He begged for a picture and city, and I said I wouldn’t without your consent.”</p><p>Agatha nods slowly. “How annoying. And flattering. I can’t really say I blame him.” She considers for a moment before tossing her hair over her shoulder. “Send him a picture of me if you’d like. Just make sure I look good in it.”</p><p>“You always look good.”</p><p>“True,” she agrees. “Every side is my good side.”</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>“Just <em>think</em>?” Agatha scoffs. “Wow. Okay.”</p><p>“Oh, shut up, Agatha. I’m <em> agreeing </em> with you.”</p><p>She raises her chin. “Agree with me with more confidence.”</p><p>“That was my version of confidence.”</p><p>“Well, I’m gonna need you to work on that because it’s a little pathetic.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “Okay, sure. Whatever.”</p><p>“No need for the ‘tude.”</p><p>Rio gives her a tight smile. “It’s funny how you shorten words like that. Very suburban mom of you.”</p><p>Agatha puts a hand to her chest. “That’s quite literally the meanest thing you’ve ever said to me.”</p><p>“Is it?”</p><p>“Jesus, yes. Suburban mom? Just fucking kill me.” It’s probably not the right thing to say in the moment, all things considered, but Agatha isn’t used to filtering herself for sensitivity’s sake.</p><p>“Mm, well, it’s true. And lucky for you, it’s hot.”</p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “It is? Do say more. I want the deets, baby.” She internally curses at herself. </p><p>Rio gives her a look. “You just proved my p—”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah — I realized I fucked up as soon as it left my mouth.” Agatha waves her off. “Doesn’t mean I don’t still want deets.”</p><p>“Well, that’s too bad. You can wait.”</p><p>“Until when?”</p><p>“Wait and see.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “You’re such a tease.”</p><p>“So are you,” Rio counters.</p><p>“Yes, but unlike me, you’re not going to do anything about it.” Agatha drags her pointer down Rio’s chest — gentle and testing. They hadn’t been…intimate like that since the whole shitshow went down.</p><p>“Maybe I will,” Rio replies. “Who knows?” </p><p>It’s noncommittal, but it’s not a total shutdown of the idea, which is deeply intriguing to Agatha. “Oh?” Her brow arches higher. “Well, I’d love to see you try.”</p><p>“Later,” she says. “Maybe.” Her gaze lands back down at the table, and she lets out a groan.</p><p>“What’s the moaning for?” Agatha asks. “The unsexy kind.” It wasn’t unsexy, really — nothing Rio does ever is — but still.</p><p>Rio gestures to the nearly untouched waffle on her plate.</p><p>“Oh. Yeah. You are going to have to take care of that. I’m not going to have you swept away by the wind.”</p><p>“Missing one meal would not turn me into a plastic bag,” Rio argues. </p><p>Agatha blinks. “Did you…did you just reference Katy fucking Perry at me?”</p><p>Rio promptly ignores her, staring back at the daunting plate once more. “I think I’m just going to eat a big lunch,” she decides.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha agrees. Rio seems to relax before she says, “After you eat breakfast.”</p><p>“Agatha, why are you so hellbent on me eating this one meal?” she whines.</p><p>“Because it’s not one meal — it’s a pattern. And because you clearly have food issues that stem from his psychotic vendetta against women enjoying chicken and cheese.”</p><p>Rio sucks on her cheek before stuffing a rather large bite of waffle into her mouth — maybe so she doesn’t have to admit Agatha is right.</p><p>“Well, you don’t have to scarf it,” Agatha says. “I don’t want you to choke.” A beat. She peers into Nicky’s bedroom — sees him still obliviously chattering away on the phone. “I want to be the only one to make you do that,” she declares, voice low. </p><p>Rio grimaces a little. “Maybe not now.”</p><p>“Well, no. Definitely not now,” she agrees. Rio’s neck was still bruised to shit, a dark ring around her throat.</p><p>“I’m not sure if…ever?” Rio admits after a second, voice so nervous it comes out like a question. “I liked it before, but I really thought I was going to die yesterday,” she whispers.</p><p>“That’s all right,” she easily assures her. “Plenty of other places I can squeeze — plenty of other things we can do instead. I don’t mind getting creative.”</p><p>Shock flickers across her face for a moment before she’s aware enough to try and hide it, looking back down at her plate. “Thanks.”</p><p>“It’s quite literally the barest minimum.”</p><p>“I suppose.”</p><p>“It is, Rio,” she insists. “You’re allowed to not want your airways blocked, for fuck’s sake."</p><p>She doesn’t look up. “He didn’t…care about that. What I wanted. It still takes me by surprise that you do.”</p><p>“Well…get used to it,” she says awkwardly.</p><p>“It’s just new. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Rio, please.” Agatha runs a hand over her face. “You know how I feel about the unnecessary apologies.”</p><p>Rio hunches a little, sinking down into her seat as if to make herself smaller. “It felt necessary.”</p><p>“Well, it wasn’t. Okay? It isn’t.”</p><p>Rio continues to stare down at the table, which makes Agatha feel like shit. And confused as to how they’d gotten here. Again. How did she always manage to fuck things up to such an extreme degree?</p><p>“I don’t— I’m just— I’m not trying to <em> scold </em> you,” Agatha clarifies. “I’m trying to be…reassuring.”</p><p>“Which is appreciated, but your tone was…a little harsh.”</p><p>“It wasn’t harsh — it was…serious. Certain. Sure. Whatever else you’d find in the fucking thesaurus.”</p><p>Rio finally looks up at her. “Well, it came off harsh. I’m not mad at you, but I need you to understand that your tone is not coming off the way you think it is right now.”</p><p>She bristles, clenching her jaw. Rio might not be mad at Agatha, but suddenly, Agatha found herself a little angry with her. “Don’t police my tone,” she snaps. “My whole life, people have been policing my tone. God forbid anyone give me the benefit of the fucking doubt for once.”</p><p>“Well, god forbid I want some gentleness the day after someone tried to take my life,” Rio counters with a mumble. </p><p>Agatha sucks on the inside of her cheek. Maybe mad. Perhaps hurt. Likely a bit of both. “I’m trying my best. And I’m well aware that’s never enough for anyone ever, but that’s the truth.”</p><p>Rio softens a little. “I know you’re trying. All I was saying was that your impact was not matching your intention. That’s okay — that happens sometimes — but the only way to get better at it is to get feedback.”</p><p>Agatha is very used to criticism — nobody ever had a problem telling her exactly everything that was wrong with her — but it was rarely for constructive reasons and never in a kind way. “Okay. Noted. Let’s just…move on.”</p><p>“No.” Rio tilts her head. “You’re upset. I know this probably isn’t your favorite thing to hear, but I’m telling you because I care about you and want you to get better at communication.”</p><p>“Got it. Thanks.” In a supremely immature move she knows will effectively end the conversation, she looks into Nicky’s bedroom. “Nicky, enough yapping — breakfast’s getting cold!”</p><p>Rio gives Agatha a look that sits somewhere between chastisement and disbelief. “Not everyone who corrects you wants to hurt you,” she says, tone something worse than irritated. It’s flat. Disappointed. Resigned. “I’ll be in the bedroom,” she evenly declares, walking into the master and shutting the door behind her.</p><p>Agatha absolutely loved to run away from problems and give people the silent treatment, but she very much doesn’t love being on the receiving end of it. “God fucking damn it,” she mutters, shoving her plate away. Suddenly, she's not hungry anymore. </p><p>“What’s wrong, Mama?” Nicky asks as he comes back into the kitchen, hung-up cell phone in hand. </p><p>“Nothing. It’s fine. Everything’s fine. Is Lilia coming on the excursion?”</p><p>“She said she would if you paid for her ticket.” </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “I’m pretty sure seniors get free admission, so sure. I’ll let her think that.” </p><p>Nicky frowns. “Where’s Ms. Rio?” She nods toward her bedroom, picking at the napkin. “Are you in a fight?” </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “Why would you assume that?” </p><p>“Because you look like you do when you and Mommy fight.” </p><p>“We’re having a…disagreement,” she says as diplomatically as possible. </p><p>Nicky looks at Rio’s plate. “She didn’t finish eating. She has to finish eating, or else she can’t go to the aquarium,” he states. Agatha doesn’t have the heart to tell him that rule applied only to him, not extending to her sort-of girlfriend she was sort-of mad at. “I’m gonna take it to her,” he decides, picking it up. </p><p>“Nicky, don’t—”</p><p>“I’ll finish mine after,” he promises.</p><p>Agatha clenches her jaw, but she can’t bring herself to stop him. She was too prideful to face Rio right now. Too prideful and too…scared. That she might let her guard down and say something she’ll regret. Not something cruel but something true — about the kind of person she is. About the kind of things she’s done. About the kind of things she’s feeling.</p><p>The kind of things she’s feeling for Rio.</p>

<p>Rio doesn’t register the door opening. She’s lying down and absentmindedly scrolling on her phone, retaining approximately nothing until she hears a little voice say, “Ms. Rio?”</p><p>She glances up. “Hey, bud.”</p><p>“I brought you the rest of your waffles,” Nicky says, holding out the plate. “I think you have to take more bites if you want to come see the fishes with me.”</p><p>“Thank you,” she says, forcing herself to sit up and take it from him. “That was very kind.”</p><p>He pushes himself up onto the bed, sitting cross-legged facing her. “My mom says that Mama is a hothead. And a lot of people think that she’s mean because sometimes, she uses her outside voice at them, even when she’s inside.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head. God, kids were observant. It was a little frightening, really. She doesn’t let her face betray her as she asks, “What do you think?”</p><p>“Mm…” He considers for a moment — deep in concentration, evident by his pinched brows. “I think…I think maybe she just forgets that she doesn’t have to use her outside voice — like sometimes how I forget to be calm around you when you’re feeling icky. Mama spent a lot of time outside when she was a kid like me.”</p><p>Rio shudders to think about just how true — how literal — that proclamation might be. Had Agatha’s mother kicked her out, left her to fend for herself on a cold winter’s night? Almost certainly, she had — when she wasn’t locking her in small, dark spaces instead.</p><p>It’s too awful to ponder, so Rio tries to push it from her mind as she nods. “I think you’re probably right. You’re very smart, you know that?” His mouth curves into a bashful smile, and he gives her a sheepish shrug. “What do you want to be when you grow up?”</p><p>“Mm…” He thinks very hard again. “An animal doctor. Or a singer. Or both.”</p><p>“Maybe you could be a vet and sing to your animal patients to keep them calm,” Rio suggests.</p><p>“Yeah.” Nicky grins. “Scratchy really likes it when I sing to him. One time, I had to hold him while Mama got a splinter out of his paw.”</p><p>“See? You’re already on your way.”</p><p>Nicky’s smile fades into a more nervous expression. “Ms. Rio?” he asks, voice uncharacteristically hesitant.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Are we gonna be friends forever and ever?”</p><p>She should just say ‘yes’ — ease his obvious anxieties — but she can’t bring herself to lie to him. “That’s a complicated question,” she confesses, which seems to confirm his suspicion that this was something to potentially fear.</p><p>“Why?” He frowns. “You don’t want to be my friend forever?”</p><p>“That’s not it at all,” she reassures him. “I love spending time with you. But there are more factors at play than just what you or I want.”</p><p>“Like what my mom wants,” he says, looking down at the blanket.</p><p>Rio nods slowly. “That’s one of them.”</p><p>“I have one friend at school named Sophie, but she thinks Mama is scary, so she doesn’t like to come over unless I’m at Mom’s house. And my other friend Emily isn’t allowed to talk to me anymore because Mama got into a fight with her mom in the parking lot. She hit the back of our car in the pick-up line, and then they yelled at each other, and the principal had to come out, and they got in trouble, and now Emily isn’t supposed to be my friend.”</p><p><em>Jesus fucking Christ, Agatha</em>, Rio thinks. “That’s…unfortunate,” she admits. “But sometimes, things just need time to blow over. Maybe Sophie and Emily’s mom will come around.”</p><p>“Maybe,” he says, clearly lacking confidence in this possibility. He looks back up at her. “Don’t be scared of her, okay, Ms. Rio? Or not talk to her even if you get in a fight.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio promises, putting out her little finger. “Pinky swear.”</p><p>Nicky links his tiny one with hers, seeming to relax a little. “Good. Because Mama likes you. A lot. A <em> lot </em> a lot."</p><p>“You think so?” </p><p>“Uh-huh. Like sometimes, she gets all red around you and messes up her words.”</p><p>“And how do you feel about that?”</p><p>He giggles, covering his mouth with his hand. “It’s funny a little bit.”</p><p>The corner of Rio’s mouth quirks into the ghost of a smile. “It is,” she agrees.</p><p>“It’s because she has a <em> crush </em> on you,” he loudly whispers, voice conspiratorial.</p><p>“I know she does.”</p><p>“And you have a crush back.” He giggles again.</p><p>“You’re very observant,” Rio muses, amused.</p><p>He nods. “I know.”</p><p>“Did you finish your food?”</p><p>“No.” He shakes his head. “I’m going to, but I wanted to give you yours first. And make sure you weren’t going to leave.”</p><p>“I won’t leave,” Rio assures him. “Your mama just said something that hurt my feelings, and I need a little space to process that.”</p><p>He frowns a little, brows crinkling. “That’s not how it works.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“You put yourself in time-out because Mama hurt you. <em> Mama </em> should be the one in time-out — so she can think about her words and actions,” he recites.</p><p>Rio can’t really argue with that logic, so she doesn’t try. “It’s okay,” she lamely replies with an equally lame shrug. “I’m just decompressing at the moment.”</p><p>“If I bring my bunny in here so you can eat with him, would that make you feel better?”</p><p>Rio reaches out to squeeze his shoulder. “That’s very sweet of you, but I think I’ll be okay. I just needed to step away for a second.”</p><p>“But you’re still gonna come to the aquarium, right? Because I really, really, really, really…<em>really</em> want you to come.”</p><p>"I’ll be there,” she promises.</p><p>He nods, her vow of attendance seeming to relax him even more. “I’m gonna go eat my waffle now,” he declares. “Or else I won’t be able to go.”</p><p>“Make sure you also drink plenty of juice and water so you’re hydrated,” Rio finds herself saying. She’s not even sure where it comes from — the maternal suggestion — and she tries not to think about it too hard. It seemed like a whole can of worms she doesn’t currently have the bandwidth to open.</p><p>“I want coffee.”</p><p>“Well, coffee dehydrates you, which could make you feel gross at the aquarium.”</p><p>“Nuh-uh. It makes me want to jump around. Mama let me have it two times even though it made Mom really mad.”</p><p>Rio doesn't point out that Agatha had likely let him have it <em> because </em> it made Wanda really mad. “And it dehydrates you,” Rio explains. “It’s also not good for someone who’s chronically sick. I can’t drink it much with my POTS.”</p><p>“Oh.” He chews on the inside of his cheek, considering. “Then I’ll abstain with you,” he decides. “Ms. Lilia taught me that word.”</p><p>“That’s very sweet of you,” Rio encourages. “And a great word to know.”</p><p>“Grown-ups tell me I have a rich vocabulary,” he states — mostly factually, though maybe a little proud, too. He was Agatha’s son, after all. Some arrogance was bound to have rubbed off on him.</p><p>“That’s a wonderful skill to have. I’m sure it’ll be very helpful as you work your way through veterinary school.”</p><p>He gives her another bashful smile before hopping off the bed to finish his breakfast. </p><hr/><p>A few minutes later, Agatha comes into the bedroom, wordlessly sitting on the chair in the corner. She glances over at the plate on the nightstand and, despite still being sort of pissed at Rio, is admittedly pleased to see she’s taken a couple more bites of her waffle. </p><p>There are a few beats of awkward silence, neither wanting to be the first to talk. Agatha crosses her arms and sucks on the inside of her cheek for a moment before, in an uncharacteristic move, caving first. “My six-year-old son just put me in time-out,” she says.</p><p>“Did he,” Rio coolly replies.</p><p>“Yes. He did.” She looks out at the window — at the waves rolling onto the shore. “If I had ever tried to send <em> my </em> mother to time-out…” She shakes her head, breathes out a humorless laugh. There would have been yelling, definitely. Bruises, probably.</p><p>“You aren’t her,” Rio assures her, some gentleness slipping into her tone despite herself.</p><p>“Mm,” she hums in tentative agreement. Rio doesn’t say anything else, so after a long, stubborn moment, Agatha sighs. “It’s just the way I talk,” she explains-slash-defends. “I thought you’d been around me long enough by now to realize that.”</p><p>“That may be true, but it’s not unheard of that a person would learn how to modulate their tone to match what’s appropriate for the situation.”</p><p>“Well, it’s not unheard of that a person struggles with that either, is it?” Agatha snaps. “I mean, <em> you’re </em> the one who accused me of…” She can’t bring herself to say it. She doesn’t know why she can’t bring herself to say it, but she can’t. </p><p>“Being autistic,” Rio finishes for her, which Agatha is both grateful for and irritated by. “There’s nothing wrong with that.”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips, shaking her head and looking out the window once more. “Whatever. It doesn’t matter. I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry. That’s what you want me to say, isn’t it?” It’s a pretty shitty apology — one Agatha knows, deep down, Rio’s right not to accept. Not even acknowledge.</p><p>“It’s okay to struggle, Agatha. What’s not okay is acting like every single person is out to get you all the time.” She’s tempted to disagree with that, as most people seem to be out to get her at most times, but for once, she bites her tongue and allows Rio to continue. “What’s not okay is making yourself the victim and being an asshole when someone tells you how they feel.”</p><p>“At no point this morning was I trying to be an asshole. Believe it or not, I’ve actually been trying to be really nice, which is why it’s so confusing that we ended up here.” Agatha clenches her jaw, more out of frustration than fury. “At no point this morning have I tried to make myself the victim either. Trust me, I’m well aware I’m not a victim. That I fucking deserve every shitty thing that’s ever happened to me.” That part is factual — not looking for pity.</p><p>Rio gives her some anyway, voice softening a bit. “I don't believe that. Nor do I believe you were trying to hurt me. But like I was trying to say earlier, your intention doesn’t outweigh your impact. For example, I may intend to…” She searches for an analogy. “...help someone carry something down a flight of stairs from a place of kindness, but on the way down, I could accidentally trip them — cause them to drop the thing or injure themselves. My intentions never changed, but the tangible impact I’ve made outweighs that.”</p><p>Agatha’s quiet for a long beat, considering. “I’ve never thought of it like that, I suppose,” she quietly admits. “Nobody’s ever explained it in that way. Given me an example.”</p><p>“Do you get it now? Why I was upset? And how that’s different from being upset <em>with you</em>?”</p><p>She nods a little, dropping her gaze from the window down to her lap. “I’m sorry,” she mumbles. “I’m saying that because it’s what you want to hear but also…because…it’s true. I am.” She was fucking terrible at apologies, but the fact she had gotten herself to say a genuine one at all was no small feat.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio says. “I appreciate it.”</p><p>Agatha shifts in her seat. It was ironic, the fact she’d come in here to appease Nicky’s time-out badgering, as the whole thing does make her feel rather like a punished child. “So what now? You hurt me back, and we call it even?”</p><p>Rio blinks, taken aback. “No? That’s not how that works — like, at all. We just…move on and try to do better.”</p><p>She looks back up at her, expression sharp. “Okay, well I don’t fucking know,” she says, defensive to mask the embarrassment. “You can hurt me if you want. I’m a big girl — I can handle it.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t want to,” Rio replies, the space between her brows creasing. “I’m not out for revenge because you made a mistake.”</p><p>“I hurt you first. It’d be justice or consequence — not revenge.” ‘Justice’ was the word courts liked to hold against her. ‘Consequence’ was her mother’s preference. Her justification for her methods of attempting to keep her in line.</p><p>“It would be neither of those things,” Rio argues. “Your consequence is feeling bad for hurting me, and true justice isn’t supposed to cause anyone harm.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck.” Agatha rubs a hand over her face. “Please don’t get all lawyer mode on me.”</p><p>“That’s not a lawyer thing — it’s just the truth.”</p><p>“Okay, fine. Whatever. Are we…good…now, or…?”</p><p>Rio slowly nods. “We are.”</p><p>“Okay,” she repeats, squirming in the chair once again. “Great. Hunky-dory.”</p><p>Rio looks at her for a long moment. “It’s okay to be honest with me, you know. About how uncomfortable this is for you. I’m well aware conflict resolution in your life has not been fruitful or painless.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat gets sore, unexpected tears rising up at that. At being seen, maybe. Or hearing someone say it so starkly.  </p><p>No, it has not been fruitful. Her mother died as the two were screaming about how much they fucking hated each other, and she and Wanda had one of the nastiest divorces her lawyer had ever seen. There was no closure in that. No growth. No point. </p><p>It certainly has not been painless, either. Conflict ended only after getting the shit beat out of her physically, verbally, legally — sometimes all three at once. And even so, it didn’t really end. Conflict was a constant hum in the background of her life. A thing that Agatha had learned to stoke because then at least she was in control of it. Agatha had made friends with conflict to survive. </p><p>She swallows hard. “No, it’s all right,” she replies, voice hoarse and thick. “As long as we’re good, I’m good.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curve into a small frown. “That’s clearly not true,” she gently pushes. “It’s okay to feel what you need to feel, Agatha. I’m not going to judge you.”</p><p>“You say that now. Everyone says that at the beginning until they realize my feelings are not palatable things. That they’re loud and violent and ugly.”</p><p>“But they’re valid,” Rio says. “Especially with everything you’ve been through. I promise you, bottling them up isn’t helping.”</p><p>“Nicky will never see inside that bottle. He <em>can’t</em>.” Agatha shakes her head vehemently, rocking back and forth a bit as she chews on her thumbnail. She hears Lilia’s voice in her head, ‘<em>Feral animal</em>.’ “I don’t…I don’t want you to see it either,” she admits, voice so quiet it’s barely audible — gaze fixed firmly on the wall.</p><p>“But I want to see."</p><p>She continues shaking her head. “It’s like a shaken-up soda bottle filled with fucking poison. I’m not letting it burst open and contaminate you.”</p><p>“I can handle myself,” Rio insists. “I want to be there with you and for you, Agatha.”</p><p>“You’ll change your mind,” she says softly. “People always do. I’ve gotten dropped by therapists, Rio. Plural. Ones the state literally assigned to me.”</p><p>“I won’t change my mind. Also, if a therapist isn’t qualified to see you, it’s not about you — it’s that they don’t want to do you a disservice. I’m going to look for someone who’s trauma-informed. People who are equipped to handle shit like ours.”</p><p>Agatha bristles, baring her teeth as her head snaps over to look at Rio. “Well, <em> I’m </em> not changing <em> my </em> mind about voluntarily seeing a fucking therapist, so don’t bother wasting your time.”</p><p>Rio gives her a look, somehow both patient and disapproving of her mini tantrum. “I meant for me.”</p><p>“Oh.” A beat as she comes down from her rush of irritation. She feels fucking stupid. Again. “I thought you were going to try and force me to…as a…condition or whatever.”</p><p>“I’m not going to force you to see a counselor,” she promises. “I just want you to let me in.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze drops to the floor once more. “My outside is much better than my inside, Rio. Believe me. Much sexier.”</p><p>“Not everything has to be sexy. I want to know you — every part.”</p><p>“You know what happened when Pandora opened the box, don’t you? You Greek mythology nerd? Bad shit happened.”</p><p>“Yes, but it was inevitable. And bad or not, those things are part of being alive. Of human nature and existence.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “You’re completely missing the point.”</p><p>“No, I’m not,” Rio argues. “You think you’re too toxic and dangerous for me to know the real you underneath the facade, but you aren’t. You’re not bad. You’re not evil. I want to know you, Agatha.”</p><p>She stares at Rio for a long, long moment — the space between her brows pinched. Like she’s speaking a language Agatha is even less familiar with than Spanish. “I don’t know,” she finally responds.</p><p>“You don’t know what?”</p><p>“I don’t know if I want to do that,” Agatha admits. “I don’t know if I can. I don’t know. About any of it.”</p><p>“Well, I believe in you. What part are you having trouble with?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Fucking all of it?”</p><p>“Elaborate.”</p><p>Agatha huffs out a breath. “I like what we have right now. Don’t you?”</p><p>“Yes, but I want more. I want a real relationship. What are you so scared of?”</p><p>“That you’re going to break my fucking heart, Rio!” she blurts before she knows she’s saying it. She blinks, having startled even herself, her shock intensifying when she feels the bottom of her left eye grow wet. “Fuck,” she whimpers, turning her head and biting her knuckles. “<em>Fuck</em>.”</p><p>Rio sighs before stepping out of bed and going to kneel in front of Agatha, her calf be damned. She gently takes the hand that Agatha’s biting in her own. “I can’t promise that whatever we have will last forever because I don’t know,” she admits. “But I <em>can</em> promise I’m going to try my hardest to make it work. That I’ll never hurt you on purpose.”</p><p>“Weren’t you the one who just said that intention doesn’t equal impact?” Agatha tries to ask dryly, though the crack in her voice betrays her.</p><p>“I know it doesn’t. But fear like that is something you have to surrender to if you’re going to try your hardest to make it work, too.”</p><p>She shakes her head. “I always survive,” she whispers. “But I wouldn’t survive that.”</p><p>“Yes, you would,” Rio encourages, thumb rubbing soothing circles on her hand. “I need you to try for me.”</p><p>There’s a knock on the door then. Lilia, probably. Lilia, hopefully. Agatha never thought she’d think that, but the alternative — the Italian police or something — seemed far worse. “I have to get that,” she says, wiping her eyes and standing from the chair.</p><p>“Nicky can answer it.” Rio sighs, managing to push herself up off the floor with a surprising amount of speed to block Agatha’s path. “You can’t avoid this forever, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha glares at her. “I am not letting my six-year-old son answer the fucking hotel door when I'm not 100% certain who is behind it,” she says, voice just as serious. “Move, Rio.”</p><p>Rio clenches her jaw before reluctantly stepping aside. “Fine. Keep running.”</p><p>Agatha charges a few steps before something makes her stop in the doorway. She balls her hands into fists before letting out a long exhale and turning to face her. “I shed a tear in front of you, Rio,” she points out. “I admitted that I was afraid of something. That is more than most people ever get from me.”</p><p>“And still, I would like more,” Rio says simply.</p><p>She bites her tongue to keep herself from making some snarky comment about that being greedy. Instead, she scrapes a hand through her hair. “Can we put a pin in this? For now? Please?”</p><p>“Details, yes.” Rio nods. “But I need a promise from you that you’re going to try.”</p><p>Agatha looks down, toeing the ground. “I wouldn’t be doing any of this if I wasn’t, Rio.”</p><p>“You mean it?”</p><p>Her eyes flicker up to meet hers. “Yes. For fuck’s sake, yes,” she says, more exasperated than anything. The knocking at the door intensifies. “Don’t be angry,” she finds herself pleading. Another bizarre statement to leave her mouth. She usually didn’t give a fuck. Usually pissed people off on purpose. “Or disappointed or upset or any of that. Just…just be patient with me, okay?”</p><p>“I’m none of those things,” Rio promises. “I’m just doing my best.”</p><p>“I am, too,” she says sincerely.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>She pokes her tongue against the inside of her cheek. “So we’re still good?” she checks. She fucking hates it. How needy she sounds. How insecure. But maybe this is what Rio wants.</p><p>“We’re good,” Rio assures her.</p><p>Agatha purses her lips and nods as another round of knocks can be heard. She rolls her eyes, turning on her heel. “I’m coming!” she snaps, striding over to the door.</p>

<p>Agatha rips the door open, revealing Lilia on the other side. “Someone’s panties are in a wad.”</p><p>Lilia lifts her chin. “It’s rude to keep someone waiting after you’ve invited them somewhere.” </p><p>“Oh, <em> I </em> did nothing of the sort — that was all Nicky.” Agatha looks her over. She’s wearing another weirdly patterned muumuu, more chunky jewelry. “Well, come in, then,” she orders, stepping to the side to reluctantly allow her to enter.</p><p>“You weren’t supposed to come out until I said,” Nicky says sternly as Agatha shuts the door behind them, pointing at the clock on the microwave. “See how that says 9, 3, 7? I wasn’t going to say until it said 9, 4, 0.”</p><p>“What do you mean, Nicky?” Lilia asks, setting her purse on the table.</p><p>“She was in time-out because she was mean to Ms. Rio.” </p><p>“I wasn’t actually—" Agatha scoffs. “I was <em>humoring</em> him, obviously,” she explains.</p><p>“Mm.” Lilia nods, her expression giving very little away. Agatha hated that — when people were unreadable. It didn’t happen often.</p><p>“Look, I said I was sorry,” Agatha says, feeling strangely chastised. Why the fuck she feels the need to defend herself to her six-year-old and some elderly wacko she doesn’t even know, she’s not sure. </p><p>“Did you <em> mean </em> it?” Nicky presses.</p><p>“Yes.” She runs a hand over her face. “I meant it.”</p><p>Lilia finally snorts a little, which pisses Agatha off to no end. “Are you excited for the aquarium?” she asks, her dumbass bangles clanging together as she turns to Nicky.</p><p>“Yes! We’re gonna see catfish, and clownfish, and angelfish, and swordfish, and eels.”</p><p>“And dolphins.”</p><p>He gasps. “<em>Dolphins</em>,” he whispers.</p><p>“Yup.” She nods, grey curls bouncing. “I saw on the pamphlet in the lobby that there are three of them.”</p><p>“I’m gonna name them Nicky, Mama, and Ms. Rio,” Nicky declares. </p><p>“Mm,” Agatha hums. “Looks like you didn’t make the cut,” she tells Lilia, more pleased by this than she should be.</p><p>“You can be a rainbow fish, Ms. Lilia,” Nicky assures her. “Because of all your colorful outfits.” Agatha wrinkles her nose. Fucking traitor.</p><p>Lilia gives him a smile. “Rainbow fish are very pretty.”</p><p>“So are you, Ms. Lilia,” he says earnestly. </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “Suck-up,” she accuses under her breath.</p><p>“Thank you, son,” Lilia says, ignoring Agatha as per usual. “What are you most excited to see?”</p><p>“Mm,” he considers before finally deciding on, “All of them."</p><p>“Do you like seahorses?” Lilia asks. “They’re my favorites. I remember yesterday you told me the males carried the offspring, and I thought that was very interesting.”</p><p>“Mhm.” He nods vigorously. “They’re also the slowest-moving fish. But that’s okay because of the tortoise and the hare story. You can be slow and steady and still win the race. Except Señor Scratchy would never, ever get beat by a turtle. I like the green ones most. What about you?”</p><p>“I’m quite fond of the gold and yellow ones, so green’s cousin, I suppose.”</p><p>Nicky tilts his head. “Cousin?”</p><p>“That’s the child of your aunt or uncle,” Lilia explains.</p><p>“Oh.” He wrinkles his brows. “But I only have one — Uncle P. — and he doesn’t have any kids.”</p><p>“And thank god for that,” Agatha mutters.</p><p>Lilia once again pays her no mind. “Well, family is more than blood. You can also adopt people you’re close to as your cousins if you’d like.”</p><p>Nicky contemplates this for a moment before declaring, very seriously, “Then I’d like to adopt you as my cousin, Ms. Lilia.”</p><p>She breathes out a chuckle. “Well, that’s very sweet of you. Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “And mathematically impossible. She can be your adoptive great-great cousin.”</p><p>Nicky nods earnestly. “I <em> do </em> think she’s great.” </p><p>“No, that’s not—“ Agatha sighs, massaging her temples. “I need an Advil.”</p><p>“I’m sure you do,” Lilia smugly muses.</p><p>Agatha glares at her. This bitch is enjoying this. Agatha doesn’t want Lilia enjoying anything, but it’s particularly annoying considering it’s at her expense. It must end. Immediately. “I’d ask you to grab me one from my purse, but you tried to rob me last time I requested that favor of you.”  </p><p>Nicky frowns. “You shouldn’t steal, Ms. Lilia.” </p><p>“Tell her, Nicky,” Agatha encourages, the corner of her mouth curving into a small smirk. “Maybe she needs a time-out, too.”</p><p>Lilia coolly smooths out her kaftan. “Well, perhaps your mother should also hear that lesson. I saw the name on her credit card yesterday, and it wasn’t Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk falls, and she sucks her teeth. Well-played, she had to admit. And infuriating. “I think Ms. Lilia should really try wearing her glasses.”</p><p>“20/20 vision, darling,” Lilia retorts, raising a brow as if to propose a ceasefire.</p><p>Considering Agatha doesn’t particularly want to have to explain Sharon Davis to Nicky, she rolls her eyes. “I’m going to check on Rio.”</p><hr/><p>From the looks of it, the woman hasn’t found the energy to do much since Agatha left. She’s still wearing her pajamas when she makes it back, zoned out as she stares at her bruised neck in the full-length mirror.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha greets, giving the doorframe a few light taps to alert Rio of her presence. The last thing she wanted to do was surprise her right now. “Lilia’s here.”</p><p>“I figured,” Rio muses, only half present. “I’m glad she and Nicky get along.”</p><p>Agatha is not actually sure she herself is glad about that, so she doesn’t offer a response. Instead, she asks, “Are you about ready to go? Nicky’s getting antsy, and Lilia’s pissing me off."</p><p>“I guess,” she says, gaze firmly fixed on the sickly purple handprints around her throat.</p><p>Agatha purses her lips before walking to her closet and fishing out a shirt. “You should wear this,” she tells her, holding out a lavender tank top with a mock turtleneck. “If you want,” she thinks to add in a rare moment of emotional intelligence. “Not, you know…a requirement. Obviously.” Though it isn’t obvious at all, Agatha knows. It’s not even the norm for Rio. “I just…I think you’d look sexy in it,” she says to try and make it better, though she’s probably making it a lot worse. “Or...not sexy. Well, I mean, <em>yes</em>, sexy, but that’s not— I don’t— I…um…I want you to be…comfortable. So. If it might make you comfortable, you may wear it,” she says, somehow veering into overly formal territory.</p><p>Rio glances at the shirt, then at Agatha. Back at the shirt. At Agatha again. Instead of verbally responding, she simply wraps her arms around her.</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha blinks, buffering for a second before hugging her back. “Okay.” Rio responds by burying her face into her neck. “Okay,” she repeats, softer now. “It’s okay.”</p><p>“I just— He never gave me a choice like that,” Rio whimpers. Agatha can feel tears wetting her collarbone. “I always had to do what he said.”</p><p>“I figured.” </p><p>“I don’t know how it happened,” Rio insists. “It wasn’t like that at first. And by the time I realized how bad it was, I didn’t see a way out.”</p><p>“Boiling frog,” Agatha muses.</p><p>Rio sniffles. “What?”</p><p>“You don’t know that metaphor? If you put a frog in boiling water, it’ll jump out immediately. But if you put a frog in room temperature water and slowly increase it to boiling, it won’t even realize what’s happening. Will stay there until it’s too late.” Agatha smooths Rio's hair. “I think I’m an anomaly — a frog that jumps out no matter the temperature.”</p><p>Rio clutches onto her more tightly. “Don’t jump out this time,” she pleads in a whisper.</p><p>Agatha purses her lips. “I’m not,” she promises after a beat. “I may be…drowning a little, but I’m still in the pot.”</p><p>She feels Rio relax against her a bit. “Good.”</p><p>It didn’t really <em>feel</em> very good, barely treading water. It was so much easier to not be in the pot at all.</p><p>There are a few moments of silence before Rio speaks, voice quiet and self-conscious. “People will stare at me."</p><p>“Because you’re so magnetic and beautiful, maybe,” Agatha tries.</p><p>Rio doesn't take the bait. “No, because there’s a bruise on my neck that even a turtleneck won’t cover.”</p><p>“It’ll hide a lot of it, and your calf could’ve happened in a number of ways," Agatha rationalizes. "You’re also well aware I have zero problem with confrontation. I’ll happily cuss and/or knock someone out in the middle of a Sicilian aquarium. Give the <em>fish</em> something interesting to observe for a change.”</p><p>“Which I appreciate, but I still hate being stared at.” </p><p dir="ltr">“It’ll be fine,” Agatha promises. “You have me, a precocious six-year-old, and an elderly nutjob on your side. We’re like the Weird Avengers.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Rio replies. Agatha can hear the eye-roll in her voice, but she can hear a small smile, too. </p><p>Encouraged, she continues. “You want me to make Lilia wear a cape, hm? Maybe some tights and spandex?” A beat. “Just kidding — nobody wants to see that.”</p><p>“I want to keep being held.” She can hear the pout in her tone now.</p><p>“While we walk around the aquarium? I’m afraid I didn’t pack Nicky’s old BabyBjörn.”</p><p>Rio pulls away just enough to glare at her. “Shut up.” She chews on the inside of her cheek for a moment before reluctantly admitting, “I should get dressed.”</p><p>“Would you like assistance?” Agatha asks, tracing a featherlight finger down her sternum.</p><p>“I would <em> like </em> to not change at all — to lie back down and sleep the rest of the day.”</p><p>“Rio.” She sighs. “I get it’s scary and exhausting, but you have to face the world. Those thoughts you’re having about offing yourself? They’re going to be a hell of a lot worse if you lock yourself away and hide from everything.”</p><p>“I know, but I hate looking this way,” she whines.</p><p>“I’m telling you — people are not going to care as much as you think. Haven’t you ever heard of the bystander effect? This world is full of meek fucking cowards who mind their business even when they should intervene,” she reasons. “Plus, aquariums are pretty dark, and everyone is addicted to their fucking phones anyway. I’m sure most of the tourists are going to be too busy taking blurry selfies by the octopuses to worry about you.”</p><p>“They don’t have to worry in order to stare and gawk.”</p><p>Another sigh. “Who gives a shit, Rio? Why do you care what a bunch of irrelevant strangers do?”</p><p>“Because I feel weak and stupid for letting this happen. Because I don’t want the world to see me that way,” she finally admits, voice unwittingly cracking.</p><p>Agatha feels herself soften. “Rio,” she tsks, voice gentle but stern as she cups her face. “You didn’t <em> let </em> anything happen.”</p><p>“I should have seen the signs,” she insists, attempting to turn away from Agatha’s grasp. It proves fruitless, Agatha holding firm. “Been more aware.”</p><p>“He camouflaged those signs beyond recognition — distorted any sense of awareness you had.”</p><p>“But I’m educated. I’m educated <em>in this</em>. I worked with women in this very position every day for years.”</p><p>“And I bet you’d never say this shit to them,” Agatha challenges. “Or to me. If it were anyone else in this situation, you would never be talking this way, would you?” she asks. A rhetorical question, of course, designed to make her realize her own hypocrisy. “You’re compassionate to a fucking fault — why does that extend to everyone but yourself?”</p><p>Rio sniffles, unable to come up with a good answer for any of that. “Why does it feel like this?” she whispers.</p><p>“Because you were with him for a long time." Agatha thumbs the tears from her cheeks. “Internalizing all of his bullshit. He’s dead, but his fucked-up narrative is still alive in your head.”</p><p>“I want to kill it,” Rio asserts, lip wobbling ever so slightly. “His voice. But it’s like it’s screaming at me.”</p><p>Agatha leans in to whisper in her ear, “I can be louder than he is. I can drown out his lies by telling you the truth. That you’re strong.” She kisses her jaw. “And brilliant.” Her shoulder. “And beautiful.” She moves to press her lips between her breasts. “Let me make you feel good,” she quietly pleads. “Just for a minute.”</p><p>Rio’s head tilts back. She sucks in a deep breath, lets it out slowly. "Don’t go too low,” she says, voice soft and deep. “I don’t want that yet.”</p><p>“Okay,” she agrees. “Can I help you undress?”</p><p>It takes another long minute before Rio nods. “Be gentle.”</p><p>“Okay,” she promises again, hand going to the bottom of her t-shirt and slowly lifting.</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath. Then another. And another. Agatha can practically read her mind: <em>It’s her — not him.</em></p><p>Agatha holds the baggy shirt below Rio’s breasts for a moment so she could drop it if she panicked, felt too uncomfortable or exposed. She lightly runs her fingertips down her now bare stomach, then the curve of her waist. “So perfect,” she praises.</p><p>Rio shakes her head, her eyes shut in a seemingly equal mix of anxiety and pleasure. “I’m not.”</p><p>“Yes, you are,” she argues — voice soft but emphatic. “I don’t appreciate being told I’m wrong. Lift your arms whenever you’re ready.” </p><p>Rio’s mouth curves into a frown of disagreement, though a second later she complies by tentatively stretching her fingertips toward the ceiling. Agatha deftly lifts the shirt over her head before tossing it to the side and cupping her breasts, gently massaging them with her thumbs. “I’ve seen enough tits to know when I’m looking at perfect ones.”</p><p>She promptly ignores Rio’s hum of dissent, leaning down to kiss one of them. “You’re like some ancient goddess,” she continues, recalling their conversation in the ocean. “Amphitrite,” she says, tongue brushing her nipple. “My Amphitrite.”</p><p>Rio hums again, though it’s definitely not in dissent this time. “I don’t think so,” she still manages to breathe out.</p><p>“Stop arguing with me about this,” Agatha says, voice low as her entire mouth encircles it now, kiss deepening but still tender. Rio whines, head dropping back further at Agatha’s ministrations. “Good girl,” she coos as she continues exploring it with her lips, her tongue, even her teeth very lightly as her hands explore the rest of her, taking their time traveling from under her armpits to just above her hips.</p><p>She feels Rio start to relax, but she can tell there’s a part of her still fighting it. Agatha feels the tension somehow — the tightness of her muscles underneath the skin of her stomach. “Let go, Rio,” she urges. “It’s okay," she tells her again. "You’re okay.”</p><p>“I’m trying,” Rio mutters, a line forming between her brows as if deep in concentration.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha assures her, lowering herself onto her knees so she can kiss down each rib. “And you’re doing so well. I'm just reminding you."</p><p>“Do you really think I’m—” Rio sucks in a breath. “—good enough?” She breathes out.</p><p>“No. I think you’re something far better than that.” She tilts her chin up slightly, peering at her through her lashes. “I think you’re more than I’ve ever dreamed of.”</p><p>Rio rights her head, opening her eyes to look down at her. “Really?” </p><p>Agatha nods a little before dropping her gaze to Rio’s stomach. She feels strangely small and vulnerable, kneeling before her and admitting these big things.</p><p>Rio reaches down to rest her hand on top of Agatha’s head, fingers gently massaging the curls. “Thank you,” she whispers.</p><p>She’s tempted to let her own eyes fall shut — allow Rio to scratch her scalp — but that seemed too intimate in the light of day. Instead, she shifts her hands so she’s holding the elastic of Rio’s pajama pants. “I’m going to take these off,” she tells her. “I’ll be careful not to touch.”</p><p>Rio nods. “Be extra careful around my stitches.”</p><p>It felt like some fucked-up game of Operation — trying to accomplish the task without touching Rio’s skin, disrupting the wound — but as Agatha had said in a much different context, she did have very talented fingers. Once they’re pooled around Rio's ankles, she looks up at her once more. “Done.”</p><p>Rio nods again, hand going to Agatha’s shoulder for balance as she lifts her foot. She scowls as she peers down, catching sight of the injury.</p><p>“Don’t look at that,” Agatha tells her. “Look at me.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Don’t look at what he did to you,” she clarifies. “Look at me telling you that it makes no difference to me. It makes things more complicated for us, but it makes no difference to how I think about you. How I...feel about you.”</p><p>Rio purses her lips, though her eyes travel up from the gash to meet Agatha’s gaze. “How does it not? I feel like trash.”</p><p>“You know what they say — one person’s trash is another person’s treasure,” she half-teases as she pushes herself off the ground, though the sentiment is remarkably sincere.</p><p>“You really don’t think I’m too fucked up?”</p><p><em>If <u>you</u> were too fucked up, </em>she's tempted to say, <em>then what the hell would that make <u>me</u>?</em></p><p>But she doesn't. For once, Agatha bites her tongue and leans in so their foreheads are touching. “You’re my fucking treasure, Rio,” she reiterates, finger lightly tracing up her spine.</p><p>Rio lets out a deep breath — the first one in a while. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “For what?”</p><p>“Being…like this.”</p><p>“Hot? Smart? Exceedingly patient? Still failing to see the reason for the apology.”</p><p>“Scared,” Rio bluntly corrects. “And weak.”</p><p>“For the millionth time, you’re not weak. And being scared is…it’s fine,” she says — the sentence tasting strange on her tongue; she’s spent her whole life desperately masking any kind of fear. “It’s normal. It doesn’t mean you’re not also brave.”</p><p>“I suppose,” she mumbles, noncommittal. “It’s just…exhausting.”</p><p>“We’ll get some coffee at the aquarium’s cafe,” Agatha promises despite knowing, of course, that’s not the kind of tiredness Rio is alluding to. She tilts her head to whisper in her ear. “I also may or may not have a flask we can use to give said coffee a little kick."</p><p>“Mm,” Rio hums in consideration. “Do you have tequila?”</p><p>“I’m sure the mini bar does. I’ll grab some while you finish getting dressed,” she says, pulling away. “I can’t wait to see you in an article of my clothing that doesn’t say 'Bohner' on it.” She smirks.</p><p>Rio manages a little smile at that. “Maybe it’ll be nice to look a little less disgusting than I feel.”</p><p>“You’ll look breathtaking,” Agatha assures her with uncharacteristic earnestness. “Like you always do.” </p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, the four of them are walking into the aquarium, spiked coffees in hand for Agatha and Rio. Agatha would have offered Lilia one, but, well…she was petty and didn't much care for the woman.</p><p>Nicky immediately goes up to a tank of tropical fish, his nose and palms pressed against the glass — eyes wide and mesmerized. He jumps excitedly without lifting his feet off the ground, essentially bouncing in place. “That’s you, Mama,” he states, looking up at Agatha as he points to a bright violet one.</p><p>“She <em> is </em> very beautiful,” Agatha agrees, placing a hand on top of his head.  </p><p>“And purple,” he states. </p><p>“And purple,” she agrees.</p><p>“That’s me,” he informs them, pointing out a tiny green one. “And that’s Ms. Rio.” His finger settles on a larger, darker olive-colored fish. </p><p>“I thought the three of us were going to be dolphins,” Agatha says. </p><p>“We’re <em>both</em>,” Nicky replies, as if this is a rather silly thing to point out.</p><p>“Got it.” Agatha gives him a serious nod. “Of course. What was I thinking?” </p><p>“Ms. Liliaaaa,” he says, eyes shifting to a multicolored one. “You.”</p><p>“Oh.” Lilia puts a hand to her chest, seemingly genuinely flattered. “Thank you, young man. That’s a lovely fish.” She points to a shimmery one a little behind the small school they’re observing. “What do you think of that one?”</p><p>“It has mirror scales!” Nicky practically squeals in delight.</p><p>“It does.”</p><p>Ironically enough, a pair of familiar faces appear behind them in the reflection of the glass. “Fuck,” Agatha mutters under her breath. Jennifer fucking Kale and...what the hell was the other one’s name? Amy? Annie? Ava?</p><p>Rio must spot the duo at the same time. “Jen?” she asks, turning to face them. “Alice?”</p><p><em>Alice</em>. That’s right. </p><p>“Heyyy,” Jen says awkwardly, panic shining in her eyes. “What, uh…what are you two doing here?”</p><p>“What are <em> we </em> doing here?” Agatha scoffs. “We’re here with my six-year-old — what are <em> you </em> doing here?”</p><p>Nicky looks back and cocks his head. “Who are you?”</p><p>“They’re people your mom and I met one night at dinner,” Rio answers before anyone else can. She shoots Jen and Alice a look warning them to corroborate this slightly warped version of events.</p><p>He crinkles his brow before looking up at Agatha. “More friends?” </p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far,” Agatha mumbles, shooting Jen a pointed look.</p><p>“Wait, so you have a kid,” Jen slowly states, blinking in disbelief. </p><p>“And you have an ugly purse,” Agatha snaps. “Are we done just listing facts now?”</p><p>“Woah, okay,” Alice says, stepping in figuratively and literally. She raises her palms, putting herself between Agatha and Jen. “What’s with the hostility?”</p><p>“There was judgment in her tone,” Agatha defends. “I heard it.”</p><p>“Mama,” Nicky warns. “That wasn’t nice. You’re gonna have to go to time-out again.”  </p><p>“<em>Again</em>?” Jen asks.  </p><p>“Oh, Jesus Christ — it’s too early for this.” Agatha takes a long sip of her spiked coffee.</p><p>“She wasn’t judging,” Alice promises.</p><p>“I was judging a little,” Jen admits under her breath. </p><p>“See?” Agatha says, throwing her hand out in Jen’s direction.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio says, lowering herself to Nicky’s height as best she can with her injured calf. “Do you want to come with me to find the sharks while your mom works this out?”</p><p>“You are not fucking leaving me alone with this,” Agatha mutters. “Lilia, go take him to the seahorses or whatever.”</p><p>Lilia rolls her eyes but complies, holding out her hand to the boy. “Come on, son. Your mother and Ms. Rio will catch up.” </p><p>Nicky looks marginally torn, but Agatha’s small smile and nod of encouragement — combined with the fact she knew he went fucking nuts over seahorses — quickly win out, allowing Lilia to lead him further into the building.</p><p>Once they’re out of earshot, Rio gives Agatha a look. “This has got to stop. Your kindergartener—”</p><p>“First grader,” Agatha corrects. Rio’s look becomes even more unimpressed, which Agatha thinks is a little unfair. “What?” she defends, throwing up her hands. “He skipped a year. I can’t help that he’s brilliant.”</p><p>“—your <em>first grader</em>,” she corrects through gritted teeth, “is behaving more maturely than you are.” </p><p>Alice gives Jen a similarly chastising look. “And you may not like Agatha, but I don’t think it’s fair to judge her for being a parent after knowing her for all of 30 minutes.”</p><p>“It’s just surprising considering—”</p><p>“Considering what?” Agatha hisses. “I thought you were all about NDAing, cone-of-silencing that shit.” </p><p>Jen purses her lips, eyes darting around. The aquarium is fairly empty, and nobody seems to be listening in. She lowers her voice anyway. “I saw the news, you know. It wasn’t that hard to put the pieces together.”</p><p>The color drains from part of Rio’s face, though other parts turn red — as if her body can’t decide whether she’s terrified or furious. “What pieces?” she asks, though she knows. Agatha knows. Everyone, evidently, knows.</p><p>“You told us your husband was homicidal,” Jen whisper-hisses. “And then, basically right after, a murder happens at this very resort? What the literal fuck did you guys do?”</p><p>“<em>We</em> did nothing,” Rio insists, her jaw clenched. “I told him I was leaving him, and when I went to get my stuff, he tried to murder me. I fought back.” She pulls down the turtleneck, exposing the bruises.</p><p>“Jesus…” Jen flinches at the sight, Alice grimacing next to her.</p><p>“You asked, and you found out,” Rio deadpans, pulling the fabric back up to hide the evidence.</p><p>“I believe the phrase is ‘<em>fucked</em> around and found out,’” Agatha unhelpfully adds. A beat. “Which you quite literally did on the beach,” she tacks on, even more unhelpfully. </p><p>“Well, <em>nobody</em> is finding out about <em>that</em>,” Jen says through gritted teeth. “Right? I cannot be pulled into this.” </p><p>“Thought you’d be used to dicey legal situations by now. The courtroom is your second home, after all, no?” Agatha tilts her head in faux innocence. </p><p>Jen glares at her. “There is about to be a second murder at this resort.”</p><p>Alice rubs her temples. “Okay, calm down. You two snapping at each other is helping no one.”</p><p>“Um, it might help us not get wrapped up in a literal murder trial, babe.” </p><p>“‘Babe’ already?” Agatha notes. “Wow, you two move quick.” </p><p>“Coming from you?!” Jen throws back, exasperated.</p><p>“First of all, the mere fact that you’re speaking to us wouldn’t get you implicated in a trial, especially considering you were nowhere near the scene,” Rio informs her. “Second of all, there’s a plethora of evidence — overwhelming amounts that should prove beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt — that what I did was self-defense, so I sincerely doubt there’s even going to be a trial at all. And third of all, I don’t have any plans to mention either of your names in any sort of official statement, so cool it.”</p><p>Jen blinks, head dipping back in surprise. She’s quiet for a beat, letting everything Rio said sink in. “I think that’s the most I’ve heard you talk,” she finally notes before glancing at Agatha. “You should shut the fuck up more often.”</p><p>“I only talk when I have something to say,” Rio tells her.</p><p>“Well, maybe you should consider having something to say more frequently.” Jen crosses her arms, clearly impressed but reluctant to admit it. </p><p>Agatha lifts her chin, proud and strangely grateful to Jen for inadvertently reiterating what she had been trying to drill into Rio. “I can’t believe I’m agreeing with this certified cunt, but she has a point. You’re one of the rare people roaming this earth who isn’t completely stupid.”</p><p>“Well, regardless, can you chill on the whole ‘murder’ thing?” Rio asks.</p><p>“Can I ‘chill’ on the whole ‘murder’ thing,” Jen slowly repeats. “I can’t even ‘chill’ on the whole ‘what I’m going to eat for lunch’ thing, so no, actually.” She glances around again, the aquarium getting marginally busier. “Look, we still need to align on what we’re going to say, and we need to do it somewhere that’s not here.”</p><p>Rio rubs her face. “Okay, fine. Let’s go to the sensory room. It should be quiet in there — more private. If anyone questions it, I’ll tell them I’m autistic and that you all came to keep me company, make sure I was okay.”</p><p>“Are you capable of ‘quiet’?” Jen asks Agatha as they begin to walk there. </p><p>“Are you capable of not being an insufferable twat?” Agatha quips back. </p><p>“Wow, a British insult. Mixing it up.”  </p><p>“I’m worldly,” Agatha deadpans.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Alice grumbles. She hadn’t stopped massaging her temples.</p><p>“Your little girlfriend-boss started it,” Agatha points out, voice obnoxiously loud. </p><p>“Shut. Up,” Jen seethes. </p><p>“Ohh, I forgot — you haven't disclosed to HR or the board or whatever corporate nonsense you're so afraid of.” Jen promptly yanks Agatha into the mercifully empty sensory room. Agatha just as promptly yanks her arm away. “<em>Get</em> your overly lotioned hands <em>off</em> me.”</p><p>Rio sucks her teeth, closing the door behind her. “We didn’t come in here for you two to continue ripping each other apart.”</p><p>Jen sighs, crossing her arms. “She’s right,” she reluctantly admits. “Alice, guard the entrance — make sure nobody comes in or tries to eavesdrop.”</p><p>Alice rolls her eyes. “Nobody is eavesdropping, Jen.” Still, she obeys, standing in front of it. “Plus, a sensory room’s door by nature is thick as hell to block outside sound, so as long as you’re not yelling, you should be fine.”</p><p>“Will you be able to manage that, Jenny?” Agatha asks, tone as if she’s talking to a baby. </p><p>“Second. Murder,” Jen threatens. </p><p>Agatha looks at Alice. “I hope she pays you a pretty penny for putting up with this shit.”</p><p>“I need both of you to be quiet for two seconds,” Rio says before Alice can reply.</p><p><em>One</em>, Agatha mouths to Jen, holding up her pointer. <em>Two</em>. Her middle finger goes to join it.</p><p>Rio glares, unamused at the antics. “Enough. When we get this figured out, I’ll leave you to brawl it out next to the stingrays, but right now, you need to put this weird beef aside.”</p><p>Agatha looks down at the ground, toeing it with her shoe. “Sorry,” she mumbles, sufficiently chastised. </p><p>“Yeah, sorry,” Jen follows suit in much the same manner.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio takes a deep breath, gathering her thoughts. “Agatha and I agreed to say that we hadn’t officially started a relationship when we saw you on the beach, so if anyone happens to ask for some reason, you can just say that we all talked for a few minutes. Agatha harassed you about your lawsuits, you got annoyed and went back to your room, end of story.”</p><p>“You said something about dinner to the kid,” Jen points out, running a hand over her face. “God, I knew that night was a bad idea. You’re already not keeping these stories straight.” </p><p>“If you want a straight story,” Agatha starts, “you should ask some straight lad—"</p><p>“What’s your point?” Rio asks Jen, effectively cutting her off. “We didn’t do anything there, and sharing a meal isn’t damning.”</p><p>“Yes, but you told him you <em> met </em> us at dinner. You’re saying now we should admit we saw you on the beach if we’re questioned. So which is it? Both?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio sighs. “We briefly met at the restaurant and then ran into each other on the beach again. But it’s pretty simple — if you don’t want to be questioned, just stay away from us.”</p><p>“Well, unfortunately, you two seem to be fucking everywhere.” </p><p>Agatha can’t help a small smirk, a small snort as she thinks of Rio’s panties soaking wet for her at the bar, Rio going down on her in the ocean, fingering her in the water and tying her up in her bedroom. </p><p>“Literally,” Agatha says under her breath, unable to help herself despite knowing it was likely to rile Rio. (Maybe even <em> because </em> she knew it was likely to rile Rio.) Part of her is fantasizing about Rio kicking these two out and fucking her senseless in the sensory room. Or giving them a sequel and doing it in front of them. She didn’t particularly care. It’d be reckless and dumb in a way that felt safe — that felt like some tiny piece of control she could cling to.</p><p>But Rio doesn’t take the bait, ignoring Agatha to focus on Jen. “Then don’t interact with us. No one asked you to come make a scene at this aquarium.”</p><p>“I’m just trying to cover my ass here,” Jen defends, irritation laced through her tone.</p><p>“Aw, but Jen, your ass isn’t that bad,” Agatha pipes up. “If I were you, I’d be more concerned about covering my face.”</p><p>Jen looks at Alice. “Are you prepared to help me hide a body? Because, I swear, you are about to spend the rest of this trip helping me hide a body.” </p><p>“Bit counterintuitive to worry so much about being implicated in a murder while constantly making homicidal threats, no?” Agatha asks. </p><p>Jen rubs her forehead, taking a calming breath she probably learned in some overpriced hot yoga class. “What did we talk about? At dinner? If anyone asks?”</p><p>“Your lawsuits. On the beach, she started hounding you about them again, so you left,” Rio spits. “Now, I think we’re done here, so <em> I </em> am going to leave, because I <em> cannot </em> keep being the most put-together person in this room, considering <em> I’m </em> the one who was almost <em> actually </em> killed yesterday.”</p><p>Alice gives her a sympathetic look before stepping aside to let her out.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck. </p><p>This was not good.</p><p>This was not good at all.</p><p>As tempted as Agatha is to reach out and stop Rio, touching her seemed like a supremely stupid idea at the moment. She knows this even through the panicked haze that unexpectedly creeps up and seizes her chest.</p><p>Déjà fucking vu. </p><p>She hadn’t meant for this to happen. Agatha never meant for it to happen, and yet, it still kept happening. Her fucking up was as predictable as the sun rising in the morning, as setting at night.</p><p>Rio had walked away from her in the bathroom last night. She’d walked away from her in the kitchen this morning. If she walked away here…would that be the third strike? Would she be out of Agatha’s life forever? Abandoned right after Agatha admitted to wanting her? After showing that she needed her? After realizing, deep down, that she probably even loved her?</p><p>
<em> I always survive, but I wouldn’t survive that. </em>
</p><p>“Rio, please,” she pleads, voice cracking with a desperation that’s almost primal — that’s jarring enough to make Jen freeze, give her an odd but uncharacteristically concerned look. <em>Feral animal</em>. “Please. Please. Don’t leave.”</p><p>“I just need a minute to—”</p><p>“I can be good," she insists without thinking. Without even being fully conscious she's saying it. It's like she's possessed by some ghost that sounds a hell of a lot like she did four decades ago. A ghost that shares a voice with her six-year-old self. "I swear, I can be good.”</p><p>Rio purses her lips, eyes filled with pity. Agatha’s pretty sure she hates it. But she’s also pretty sure she’d do anything to keep seeing her eyes right now, no matter what they were looking at Agatha with. </p><p>“Agatha, I promise I’ll be right outside,” Rio gently assures her. “Just let me catch my breath, okay? I’ll come right back for you."</p><p>Agatha rubs her chest, realizing she can’t seem to do that breathing thing either. She wants to see Rio — needs to see Rio — but she can’t bear the thought of following her out. Of letting anyone see her like this: so vulnerable and weak and fucking pathetic. </p><p>So she sinks down onto a chair in the relative safety of this room. Not really by choice, if she’s being honest — her shaky legs not giving her much of an option. </p><p>“I’m gonna— We’re—“ Jen starts, extremely out of her depth here. “Um. So. Yeah…” She takes Alice’s hand, lightly tugging her out of the room. “Good talk. See you around. Or…hopefully not.”</p>

<p>Agatha has no idea how long she stays in the sensory room alone — all alone — with nothing but the voices in her head to keep her company. (Her mother’s voice, mostly. Reminding her that she’s evil, that she’s worthless, that she’s unlovable.) </p><p>She has no idea how long it is until the door opens. Has no idea how long before she looks up, hoping and praying it’s Rio, and instead scowling and baring her teeth when it turns out to be none other than the waiter kid. Barry, she thinks. Or Benny. Something that starts with ‘B’ and has double letters somewhere in it. </p><p>“Get. Out,” she snarls. </p><p>“Yup.” He raises his hands immediately, allowing the door to slowly fall shut once more. “Sorry.”</p><p>She hears the door open back up a second later. “I <em> just </em> said—” she snaps before realizing it is Rio this time. “Sorry,” she rushes to say, heart sinking lower in her chest. “I’m sorry. I thought you were somebody else.”</p><p>Rio lets out a noise between a hum and a groan, acknowledging her without actually saying anything — without actually forming words. She takes a seat on the bench next to Agatha, leaving a couple of feet of space between them.</p><p>Agatha chews on the inside of her cheek. “It was funny on the beach,” she weakly explains. “Me talking to her like that. It was foreplay.”</p><p>Rio takes a few deep, intentional breaths, gently rocking herself back and forth. “Different scenarios with different stakes,” she manages to explain.</p><p>“I see that now,” she quietly admits. The sad truth is, she didn’t a few minutes ago. The sadder truth is, even if she had, she had a very limited amount of tools to work with — humor, violence, sex — and none of them were what Rio would have deemed appropriate for the situation.</p><p>“I’m just overwhelmed,” Rio reassures her, reaching up to tap on her sternum — some kind of self-regulation technique, most likely. Agatha has no idea how anything like that works. “Not mad.”</p><p>“It’d be fine if you were,” she mumbles. Agatha was mad, after all. Which wasn’t all that surprising — she was usually mad at something or another — but she’s angry at herself this time. Livid. She rests her elbows on her knees, pressing the heel of her hands into her eyes. “I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me.”</p><p>“You went through a lot of shit, and now you don’t know how to process emotions,” Rio reasons.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, pushing harder — seeing stars. “I’ve always been like this.”</p><p>“It’s called developmental trauma — it creates those behavioral responses really early on.”</p><p>“I mean before that. The moment I was born. Hell, the moment I was fucking conceived.”</p><p>Rio stops rocking, stops tapping, stops everything in order to look at Agatha, then. To focus her full attention. “No. That’s not true.”</p><p>Agatha drops her hands from her face to meet her gaze. “You’re sweet, Rio. You don’t know what you’re talking about, but you’re very sweet.”</p><p>“Yes, I do, Agatha,” she firmly declares. “You’d rather think you’re cursed or inherently bad or <em> whatever </em> because it’s easier to believe that bullshit than it is to accept that your upbringing fucked you up in ways that permeate the fabric of your being.”</p><p>“I’m not denying the fact that my mother being a grade-A cunt exacerbated the situation, but you can’t entirely blame nurture or a lack thereof when there’s also nature to consider.”</p><p>“Nature is completely and inextricably linked with nurture, and they interact with one another,” Rio argues. “Genes may be activated or deactivated based upon your environment, and this whole ‘predisposition’ thing people love to talk about isn’t really as big a deal as everybody seems to think. It amounts to genetic priming that usually requires environmental influence for the gene to behaviorally ‘do’ anything. Your psychological nature is pretty well blank when you’re born.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to ask why the actual fuck she could just pull a collegiate-level science lecture out of her ass like that, but Rio answers — as if reading her mind — before she can form the words, “I got a biology degree in undergrad.”</p><p>Agatha closes her mouth. Then wrinkles her brows and opens it again. “That’s super weird.”</p><p>“Well, it’s true. There are a lot of misconceptions about the role genetics plays in—”</p><p>“Why did you major in <em> biology </em> and then go on to do law?”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio shrugs. “I don’t know. Because I could.”</p><p>What a strange girl. What a strange reason. Agatha robbed convenience stores because she could. Got blackout drunk on stolen vodka because she could. Went to a bar to drink more and fucked multiple women in the bathroom because she could.</p><p>“It’s been a while,” Rio continues, “but I remember those behavioral genetics classes well. I always found them interesting.”</p><p>“Well, they’re irrelevant in this particular scenario, but you know, gold star, A+, etcetera.”</p><p>“They’re very relevant. Your brain and DNA are made up of the exact same things as everyone else's. You are the way you are because of things you had to survive within your environment.”</p><p>“Still talking science to me, hot stuff? Is this your way of saying you want to do some professor-student roleplay? Because I could be into that.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t take the bait. “No, Agatha. I’m telling you that you aren’t an exception. That you aren’t some special case of fucked up.”</p><p>“Accusing me of normality? I’m wounded.” </p><p>Even now, Agatha can’t seem to stop herself. She wants so desperately to be able to stop herself, but somehow, the words keep leaving her mouth anyway.</p><p>She doesn’t like that Rio doesn’t immediately say anything back, but she is grateful she doesn’t walk away again. She finds herself…twitching in her chair. A restless, nervous buzz humming through her body. It feels like some strange, hellish combination of alcohol withdrawal and childhood. She crosses her arms over her chest, trying to squeeze herself still. </p><p>Rio sighs. “Look, I’m not going to engage in a conversation that isn’t sincere and genuine. I know humor is your defense mechanism, but you have to stop making jokes and seriously communicate with me.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know,” Agatha snaps through gritted teeth — more out of overwhelm than anything. Frustration, yes, but mainly at herself. She sucks in a deep, shaky breath and looks up at the fluorescents on the ceiling. “Can you—” she starts, voice stilted and unnatural. “Will you just—“ She’s trying, she’s trying, she’s <em> trying </em> to express her needs — the real and vulnerable kind — but fighting against every instinct she’s ever acquired is proving hard mentally, emotionally, physically.</p><p>“What, Agatha?” Rio prompts, voice gentle but firm. “I need you to tell me.”</p><p>“Will you…hold me? Or…hit me?” she awkwardly requests, cheeks burning red at how deeply ashamed the plea makes her feel. “I don’t particularly care which. Just…touch me. Put me back in my body.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio softly agrees, that same pity that Agatha saw in her eyes making its way into her voice now. Or maybe it's compassion. Agatha's not sure. She can't seem to be sure about anything these days. “Okay.” She slides down the bench, closing the distance between them and pulling her in.</p><p>Agatha grimaces, sucking air in through her teeth as she turns her head away from Rio — chin resting on her opposite shoulder. Her body’s shivering like she’s outside in the middle of a Salem winter without a coat. (She knows what that’s like.) </p><p>“You chose the first one,” she finally observes. Her voice is impressively even, but it is thick as if there are tears caught in her throat.</p><p>“I don’t want to <em> hit </em> you. Even if I am frustrated.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because that would be wrong, Agatha.” Her tone is patient, as if talking to a child, but somehow, it doesn’t feel condescending.</p><p>It also doesn’t really answer Agatha’s question. People wanted to do wrong things all the time. People <em> did </em> do wrong things all the time. Agatha, for instance — all she ever seemed to be able to do was the wrong thing. </p><p>She doesn’t bother pointing this out. The answer, probably, was just that Rio was good. Was the kind of person who wanted to do the right thing and even usually managed to pull it off. </p><p>“Please talk,” Agatha requests, eyes still fixed on the wall opposite Rio — on a faded, peeling jellyfish sticker. “It doesn’t matter what you say. But if you don’t talk, I’ll talk, and everything that comes out of my mouth always makes it all worse.” <em>Always makes you leave.</em></p><p>“I need a little break from talking,” Rio admits, unhooking one arm from Agatha in order to take her phone from her pocket and put on some music. “Here.” </p><p>Agatha’s sure it’s calming for Rio — the whole world quiet except for the music — but it’s fucking agony for her. It’s fucking hell. It’s quiet enough that she can hear her heartbeat, quick and loud. Her breaths, shaky and wet. Her thoughts, the ones that have her mother’s voice. She feels restless and trapped and so like that caged, feral animal Lilia had accused her of being.</p><p>It’s three and a half songs before her body can’t bear it. The stress or the shame or whatever the fuck that feeling was swirling in her stomach, spoiling in her gut.  </p><p>Rio’s arms are suddenly too tight — too hot — and she untangles herself from them without looking at her, pushing herself off the bench with trembling arms. Her head, she’s suddenly realizing, is fucking pounding. Her head is fucking floating. Her body is lead. Her body is weightless.</p><p>Rio breaks from her haze at the sudden movement, shooting her a concerned look. She’s probably either very, very pale or very, very red. She’s not exactly sure which. “Agatha?</p><p>Agatha never had a problem mouthing off to her mother, despite the fact that it never really ended well for her. Nor sassing judges despite her lawyer’s advice — her lawyer’s pleas, really — to refrain. But in this moment, Agatha finds the prospect of opening her mouth downright terrifying. Surely, she’s bound to say something insensitive and inappropriate to make Rio walk away again — walk away and never come back. Or perhaps, in this…this fucking <em> state </em> she found herself again, she’d find herself admitting to it all. The awful things she’s done in the past and what she deeply desired for her future despite the fact she doesn’t deserve it. </p><p>What actually happens when she opens her mouth is…possibly a blessing or possibly worse than either, as she doesn’t manage to get a single word out. Instead, Agatha throws up a blueberry waffle in the fucking sensory room of a Sicilian aquarium.</p><p>Rio must see it coming, as she manages to kick the small trash can in her direction just in time for it to catch the vast majority of the vomit. She uses one hand to guide Agatha back down to the bench, the other to gather her hair away from her face.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t cry, but on the off chance the waterworks do manage to possess her body, she most certainly doesn’t cry <em>in public</em>. Even when Nicky was in the hospital — when it looked like he might not make it all those endless weeks — she waited until she was in the car. </p><p>Agatha cries now, though. Sobs, really — harder than she has since she was a baby. Maybe not even then. Evanora didn’t have much patience for that. Maybe it’s from feeling downright fucking mortified, or maybe it’s from feeling Rio’s hands in her hair — so, so gentle — or maybe it’s some combination of both.</p><p>“Shh,” Rio soothes, rubbing her back. It’s clear from the hesitation in her voice — the stiffness in her movements — that she feels out of her depth. It’s clear from the warmth in her voice — the tenderness in her touch — that she’s a natural at it anyway. “It’s okay.”</p><p>That makes her cry harder, somehow — something she wasn’t actually convinced was possible. “You shouldn’t—“ she chokes out. “—be doing this.”</p><p>“Hush,” Rio murmurs. “I should.”</p><p>“No,” she argues, voice strangled but stern and somehow more sure than she’s ever sounded about anything. “You shouldn’t.”</p><p>“I should,” Rio replies with equal certainty. “I can. And I will."</p><p>“Why? Tell me why. There are eight…billion…people on the planet,” she says, sounding choppy and borderline hysterical. “Why…do you insist on choosing…the worst ones…every fucking time?”</p><p>“There’s a difference,” Rio calmly replies, “between the scum of the earth and flawed people who try.”</p><p>“And what happens when I try…and I try…and I try…and I’m <em> still </em> the scum of the fucking earth?”</p><p>“You’re not, Agatha. But if you feel like you are, then you keep trying. People who want to change usually can.”</p><p>‘Usually’ is not always, and Agatha is not ‘usual’ by any definition of the word. </p><p>She pulls away from Rio’s touch, more reluctant than she wants to admit, and turns to face her. She must look an absolute mess — face puffy and splotched, the little mascara she bothered to swipe on running down her cheeks — but it’s necessary. </p><p>“I need to know…why you’re doing this for me. When you were…almost killed yesterday. When you <em> killed </em> yesterday. What do you see, Rio?” she demands. “What do you see? When you look at me? Right now?”</p><p>Rio purses her lips, carefully considering her words. “I see someone who’s hurting,” she finally says. “Someone who’s overwhelmed and doesn’t know why she’s being given grace and comfort. I see someone who’s funny. Someone who cares so much about me. Despite her struggle to admit it, I know she cares.” The corner of her mouth twitches into a frown, head tilting in sympathy. “I see someone who hates herself. Someone who thinks she’s irredeemable even though she isn’t.”</p><p>Agatha squeezes her eyes shut, unable to look at the sincerity in Rio’s. Unable to look at her as she whimpers. </p><p>It takes a few shuddering, violent breaths before she can get any words out — ask a crucial question. “Do you want <em>me</em>?” she whispers. “Or do you just want to fix me? Do you like <em>me</em>? Or do you just like the idea of what you think I could be?”</p><p>“I want you, Agatha,” she assures her. “I like you. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.”</p><p>That heals something in Agatha. No one had ever wanted her just as she was — not her mother, not her ex, not the world. </p><p>But it breaks something in her, too. Shatters her. </p><p>She lets out another sob and collapses into Rio, silently hoping that she’ll pick up the pieces. Silently <em> trusting </em> her to.</p><p>Rio wraps an arm around her, reaching for a tissue with her free hand and wiping the excess vomit off Agatha’s chin. Once that’s done, she wraps the other arm around her, too.</p><p>Agatha takes that as an invitation to bury her face into Rio’s chest, tears immediately soaking the shirt she’d let her borrow that morning — no doubt staining it with makeup, too — but Rio doesn’t flinch. She doesn’t move. She doesn’t do anything but stroke her hair with one hand, trace soothing circles on her back with the other.</p><p>It’s the most unnatural, uncomfortable, hardest thing Agatha’s ever done — letting herself be held.</p><p>It’s the most innate, calming, easiest thing in the world — being in Rio’s arms. </p><p>“This is it,” Agatha quietly notes. “The inside of that bottle I told you about.”</p><p>“And that’s okay,” Rio promises. “I’m not running away, am I?”</p><p>No, she’s not — even if she definitely should be. No, she’s not — even if she probably will eventually. Right now, she’s not — and right now, that’s enough.</p><p>Right now, for the first time in her life, maybe Agatha is enough, too.</p>

<p>Time moves strangely in the sensory room. Just as Agatha had no idea how long it was before Rio returned, she has no idea how long she’s in her arms before the door opens again. </p><p>She would hate for a stranger to see her like this. </p><p>She would <em> despise </em>for the stupid waiter kid or stupid Jen or Alice to see her like this. </p><p>But, fuck, she would take any of those options in a heartbeat over who actually opens the door and sees her like this. </p><p>“Ms. Rio! Mama!” Nicky greets excitedly as ever, though the enthusiasm quickly dissipates as he takes in his mom’s condition. The sight of his mother crying is so jarring, so unsettling, so frightening that it makes tears immediately spring to his own eyes. “Mama?”</p><p>“Hey, kiddo,” Rio greets. “Everything’s okay. Your mom’s just got a really bad tummy ache."</p><p>It’s an admittedly good cover — made even better by the fact it wasn’t a total lie and something Nicky could relate to as someone who was often sick — but it doesn’t completely reassure him. It doesn’t even seem like he completely believes it. He was smart, sometimes inconveniently so, and unluckily for Agatha, he’d inherited her tendency to sniff out bullshit.</p><p>But if he senses her bluff, he doesn’t call it, instead yanking his hand from Lilia’s hold and darting across the room. “Mama,” he repeats, throwing his arms around her. </p><p>Agatha adjusts quickly, her son’s well-being, as always, taking immediate priority. She shifts out of Rio’s embrace completely in order to wrap her arms around him. “It’s okay, baby,” she soothes, throat sore from vomiting, from crying, from the whole fucking fiasco. “I’m okay.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Rio says, placing a hand on the little boy’s shoulder, “will you stay here while I go get your mom a water bottle?”</p><p>“Yes.” He sniffles, clinging to Agatha as tightly as he can. “But not a plastic one. They’re bad for the turtles.”  </p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha mumbles under her breath. She never should’ve taken him to that boring-ass environmentalism lecture.</p><p>“That might be all they have,” Rio regretfully informs him. “But we’ll recycle it, okay?”</p><p>“Okaaaay,” he reluctantly agrees.</p><p>Rio nods and silently exits the room, no doubt attempting to regulate her own breathing, her own brain on the walk to the vending machine. Agatha can't help but feel a bit guilty, but she shoves it — along with the rest of her feelings — back into the bottle. Just because she’d let Rio peek inside didn’t mean Nicky was going to do the same. That she would never let happen.</p><p>“So,” Agatha awkwardly starts, carding her hand through Nicky’s hair — keeping her eyes fixed on it, too. Looking at Lilia felt…risky considering her sensitive state and how obnoxiously, freakishly well the old bitch seemed to be able to read her. “What did you two get up to? See the seahorses?”</p><p>“And we caught the end of the sea lion show,” Lilia confirms. Agatha can feel her eyes studying her intently. “Want to tell your mom about that, son?”</p><p>“They balanced balls on their noses. And barked, kinda like a dog. And jumped up and caught fish in the air.” He tilts his chin just enough to look up at Agatha without breaking from her hold. “It was a little sad, because I liked the fish, too, but that’s just the circle of life,” he gravely explains.</p><p>“Tell her the special part about where we were sitting,” Lilia encourages.</p><p>“Oh, yeah. We sat in the front row, so we saw the trainers get ready. And we got splashed!” </p><p>“Is that why your hair’s wet,” Agatha muses, continuing to run her hand through his locks.</p><p>Rio steps back in then, a bottle of water in her hands. “Here you go,” she says as she passes it to Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you,” she says as she takes it, arms still around Nicky as she avoids Rio’s eyes as well. The aftermath of her breakdown was too…awkward. Too vulnerable. Like this was the morning after some intense one-night stand but for her emotions instead of sex. </p><p>She curses the way her hands shake as she tries to twist the cap off. Fucking hates herself for not being able to complete such a simple task. She tries not to think of the irony of struggling to open bottles of both the physical and metaphorical sort today and how humiliating both experiences had ultimately proved themselves to be.</p><p>Rio sees her battle and wordlessly reaches over to open it.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha mumbles again, holding it to her lips. </p><p>“Why did the waffle make you sick, Mama?” Nicky asks. “It didn’t make me sick. Or Ms. Rio. And why did you cry? You never, ever cry.”</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, opening her mouth without quite knowing how she’s going to answer that. But before she’s forced to find out, Rio jumps in again.</p><p>“Well, everyone’s body is a little different,” she says. “You know how sometimes you cough, and my heart has some issues? Your mom’s body just had a bad reaction, and there could be a lot of reasons for that.”</p><p>“Oh.” He nods against Agatha’s stomach. “I…guess that makes sense.” There’s the smallest undercurrent of skepticism, like deep down he knows this isn’t quite the full story, but it seems to be a good enough answer for now.</p><p>Agatha risks eye contact with Rio for a brief moment to mouth, “Thank you,” again. That and ‘I’m sorry,’ two phrases she almost never uttered previously, seem to be the only things leaving her mouth today. Other than vomit, that is.</p><p>Rio nods a little, slumping down into one of the beanbag chairs.</p><p>Fuck, Agatha is not in any position to take charge and make decisions right now. Nor, it seems, is Rio. Agatha makes eye contact again — this time with, ugh, Lilia — shooting her a look like, ‘Fucking do something, old woman. Can’t you see we need help?’</p><p>Lilia breathes out a scoff from her place near the doorway. Her crossed arms seem to say, 'Don't look at me.'</p><p>Agatha’s expression turns more desperate but also more pissed off — a pleading snarl. 'Don't make me grovel...not in front of these two...'</p><p>She gets a defensive shrug in return. 'I really don't know what you expect me to do, you bossy bitch.'</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, throwing her head back. Absolutely useless. </p><p>“Nicky, what do you want to do next, hm?” she murmurs. Her six-year-old. Her six-year-old son was going to have to lead here. </p><p>“Can we see the dolphins now?” </p><p>“All right.” Agatha nods, making a move to set him down on the ground. </p><p>“No,” he says, his grip tightening around her neck. “Carry.” </p><p>Agatha bites the inside of her cheek. She was probably not in the state to be carrying a 45-pound child around, but she wasn’t about to deny him. Not when he so clearly needed to be close to her. Not when she so badly needed to be close to him, too. “Okay,” she agrees, knees wobbling the slightest bit as she stands from the bench.</p><p>Rio reaches a hand out to steady her, and she feels a jolt run through her at her touch. Just moments ago, she had let herself feel so safe in it, which means it’s infinitely more dangerous now. Rio had dismantled part of her wall. And it was nice in some way — there was more light now, more air coming in — but she was also left exposed. Left vulnerable. </p><p>“You expecting a tip or something?” Agatha mumbles to Lilia as she walks past her holding the door, a relatively stupid dig but a necessary one for her to feel more like herself again.</p><p>Lilia’s lack of a sassy retort only serves to make her feel more pitiful. As does the appearance of the stupid fucking waiter kid right outside the doorway again. He does look downright terrified of Agatha, though, which is somewhat comforting.</p><p>“Sorry,” he immediately blurts. “Sorry. I didn’t realize you were still—“ His nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air. “Did someone puke in there?” </p><p>“Why?” Agatha snaps. “You gonna have to clean it? You work here, too?”</p><p>“Yes,” he surprises her by saying. “I’m…literally wearing the uniform.” He gestures at a navy polo with the name <em> BILLY </em> embroidered in cursive above the aquarium logo and a pair of khaki shorts. </p><p>“Oh. I thought you just dressed like a dork.”</p><p>“Sorry for the mess,” Rio apologizes, giving him a tight smile as she ushers Agatha away from the potential conflict.</p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha informs him over her shoulder.</p><p>Rio shoots Billy a pleading, ‘Please, don’t poke the bear’ look, and he lifts his palms innocently, shaken and confused by Agatha’s general demeanor.</p><p>Rio breathes out a sigh of relief as they make it to the dolphin area without any more bloodshed. “I’m going to grab something to drink while you guys watch the show.”</p><p>“No.” Nicky shakes his head. “No more plastic. And you have to see them with us. I named one of them after you.”</p><p>“He’s right,” Agatha agrees, unable to look at her even as she tries to convey, through those two syllables, ‘Please, don’t leave me. Please, I need you.'</p><p>Rio rubs her forehead. “I’ll use a paper cup, Nicky. And I’ll just be five minutes — I’ll make it for the end.”</p><p>“You promise you’ll come?” he presses. “In time to see them?” </p><p>Agatha glances at her then, silently asking the same. ‘You’ll promise you’ll come? That this isn’t too much? That <em> I’m </em> not too much?’</p><p>“I’ll be there,” she vows. “I just need a second.”</p><p>“Go ahead,” Agatha replies, looking away once again. “You don’t need my permission.”</p><p>She mostly means it to be reassuring — that she wasn’t going to control her like Thanos used to. That she could go where she wanted, do as she pleased. </p><p>But the slightest bit of hurt creeps its way in — the slightest bit of snark to try and mask it. Rio hadn’t seemed to need this much space before Agatha had admitted to needing <em>her</em>. Before she had cracked the lid of the bottle Rio had begged and begged to see inside. That’s always how it seemed to go.</p><p>To her credit, Rio is only gone for about five minutes — three hundred agonizing seconds that tick down slowly as Agatha attempts to pay attention to Nicky’s seemingly endless well of dolphin facts. As soon as she takes her seat, she reaches over and clasps Agatha’s hand in either a subtle act of comfort or a silent plea to receive it. Perhaps a bit of both. </p><p>Agatha glances down at it, then up at Rio’s face, then down at her hand again. Wordlessly, she shifts her fingers so she’s holding it back. </p><p>“You’re breathing funny, Ms. Rio,” Nicky astutely points out from his place on Agatha’s lap, brows pinched in concern. “Do you need my PEP mask?”</p><p>“I’ll be alright,” she assures him. “Sometimes, I just feel a bit overwhelmed, but I’m working on getting back to normal.”</p><p>“Mama says normal is overrated.”</p><p>The ghost of a smile appears on Rio’s face. “It is,” she agrees. “But I’m trying to calm down so I can focus on enjoying all of the animals.”</p><p>“Do you know which one of the dolphins is you?” he asks, pointing out at the large tank. Then, before she even has a chance to reply, “Guess.”</p><p>“Hm.” Rio narrows her eyes, surveying the three dipping in and out of the water. “I’m not sure.”</p><p>“You have to <em>guess</em>,” he reiterates.</p><p>Agatha lightly squeezes Rio’s hand with just her pinky. “The one on the left,” she says, catching on.</p><p>“Yes!” Nicky squeals, clapping in delight. “How’d you know?!”</p><p>“Must've just gotten lucky.” She shrugs.</p><p>“You should buy a lottery ticket,” he replies, so casually it catches Agatha off guard and makes her laugh — hard and genuinely for the first time in a while. </p><p>“<em>What</em>, babe?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“That’s what Ms. Lilia told me yesterday,” Nicky explains, confused as to what’s funny. “A ladybug landed on me, and she said it was a lucky omen and that I should buy a lottery ticket.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio hums, mouth twitching into another small smile. “But we aren’t in America right now.”</p><p>“Sicily has its own lottery, and anyone of age can play it,” Agatha points out. </p><p>“How do you even <em>know</em> that?”</p><p>Nicky quickly deems the grown-up conversation irrelevant, checking out of it and turning to Lilia to inundate her with even more dolphin trivia. Which was fine by Agatha. She was about dolphined out, and she relished the chance to speak to Rio a bit more freely while still keeping him close.</p><p>“I could ask you the same about so many topics,” Agatha replies. “But I read about it when I was researching local casinos in case the activities at this place turned out to be boring as shit.”</p><p>“Ah.” Rio nods. "I’m not really a gambling person.”</p><p>“Or maybe you’re just not very good at it,” Agatha counters. “I’m an exceptional gambler. Blackjack, craps, poker — there’s nothing like the rush of beating a table full of arrogant pricks at poker.”</p><p>“Statistically, it’s very hard to be good at gambling without cheating.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure it is.” Which is exactly why she always did.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. She knows this, of course. “You’re good at it for a reason.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs in faux offense. “I’m not sure what you’re implying, Ms. Vidal. Fortune simply smiles upon me. After all, I won the genetic lottery way back in the womb considering I came out looking like this.” She was cursed as fuck in every other manner, genetically speaking, what with the fact of her mother. But to point that out would be to dilute her argument.</p><p>Rio’s small smile grows. “Your hair is very nice,” she agrees. “So is your smile.”</p><p>“Oh, you flatter me, dear.” The corner of her own mouth curves into a smirk. “Please, do go on.”</p><p>“Maybe later,” Rio says, giving her a gentle nudge. “But I do mean it.”</p><p>“My perfect eyes, tits, and ass are impatient and offended to be left out of the conversation." A beat as she lifts her chin. "But thank you.”</p><p>It scares her, how easy it is to fall back into this banter with Rio. This rhythm. This…relative peace. It’s reassuring, in a way, that even after she’d fallen apart, they could have this. But it’s dangerous, too. It ran the risk of tempting her to let her guard down again — let it down further than before. She had played with fire, and while it had made her feel warm in the moment, she was bound to get burned. And Agatha Harkness was too smart to get burned.</p><p>“Look!” Nicky points at the tank. “Ms. Rio dolphin and Mama dolphin are cuddling."</p><p>Rio chuckles a little bit, looking out at the two dolphins swimming beside each other. “Why is that one your mom?”</p><p>“Because its skin’s a little purple,” he explains. “And it has marks on its back, too.” </p><p>Ah. There it was. The stark, swift reminder that peace was something Agatha didn’t get — didn’t deserve.</p><p>She can’t help but flinch a little, taken aback by the mention of the light scars that line down her spine. Agatha was more than confident in most of her skin, but she couldn’t help but loathe that particular patch of it.</p><p>Nicky tilts his chin, looking up at her from his place on her lap. “I saw them when you were in your swimsuit,” he casually informs her, thinking nothing of it. Why would he? Nicky had never suffered at his mothers’ hands like she did. Never knew one could be so cruel. </p><p>“Mm.” Agatha simply nods a little, the nauseous feeling swirling in her gut once more.</p><p>“And marks or not,” Rio gently butts in as she takes in Agatha’s nearly paralyzed response, “I know you love your mom a lot.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” he proudly confirms with a grin, face still tilted up. “I do.” </p><p>His smile drops when Agatha doesn’t return it. Doesn’t reassure him that she loves him back like she always does, her gaze distracted and far away. “Mama?” he asks, his post-sensory room concern for her flaring up again tenfold. “Mama, are you sick again? Mama, did— did I say something bad?”</p><p>Rio looks between the two, inhaling a hesitant, grounding breath. “Hey, Nicky — can you look at me?” </p><p>He shrinks into himself but turns his face to her as requested. </p><p>“You’re all right. And she’s all right. You didn’t do anything wrong. But those marks you mentioned? They're probably really hard for her to think about.”</p><p>“But why?” he asks, voice small. “They’re like stripes on a tiger.”</p><p>“Well, because there are bad memories associated with them.”</p><p>“Bad memories like how?” </p><p>“Like nothing,” Agatha responds, snapping out of her haze and running a shaky hand through his hair. “Like nothing, baby. Mama just got distracted by the dolphins for a minute.” She shoots Rio a look, equal parts grateful and warning: ‘Thank you, but don’t you dare say another word on this.’</p><p>Nicky looks up at her, face panicked but also…betrayed. “You’re lying.”</p><p>Agatha’s head jerks back slightly. She’d never seen that look in his eyes before. Never heard that tone in his voice. Most certainly never directed at her. “I’m not lying. I—" </p><p>“Yes, you are. You’re lying.” He tears up, fear and frustration alike bubbling up. “Why are you lying?" </p><p>Agatha blinks. “Nicky—" </p><p>“Why do you lie?!”</p><p>A few people turn around to look at them. Agatha tries not to think of the irony. Rio had been so worried people would stare at her, yet here <em>she</em> was, the one on display — more than the fucking dolphins even.</p><p>“Why do you lie?!” he repeats, shoving her stomach. </p><p>“Nicky!” she says, more out of shock than chastisement. </p><p>“<em>Why</em>?” The tears stream down his face now — red and pinched — as he continues shoving his tiny hands against her. “Why? Why? Why?” </p><p>“Stop, Nicky,” she practically pleads, pulling him tight against her. “Please, stop," she whispers. Her voice cracks. Her heart cracks with it. </p><p>He struggles in her grasp for a few moments before giving up, his body going lax against her as he cries, face smushed against her shirt. </p><p>“Shh,” she soothes, hugging him close. She feels the urge to fucking wail, too — for the…third time that day? Honestly, she’d lost count at this point. “It’s okay,” she lies again. “It’s okay.”</p><p>The moment is interrupted by an unfamiliar voice coming from a face that looks…vaguely more familiar than Agatha would like. She’s seen some of these features on another man’s face before, minus the thick head of brown hair that looked straight out of a boy band. “Rio?” he says.</p><p>“Who the hell is that?” Agatha asks Rio under her breath, still rubbing Nicky’s back.</p><p>Rio’s eyes go wide, jaw dropping in shock. “Eros,” she says by way of greeting, indirectly answering Agatha’s question in the process. One of them, at least.</p><p>“Who the fuck is Eros?”</p><p>He speaks before Rio can. “Her brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“<em>Former</em> brother-in-law,” Rio whispers. “Please. Thanos is—” She evidently can’t bring herself to say ‘dead,’ but Eros doesn’t need her to.</p><p>“Right.” He grimaces, swiping a hand through his hair. “I only found out…well, hours ago. Still adjusting.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Her fingers fidget in her lap. “How— What do you know? I mean, do you— questions? Do you have questions? Should we go talk?”</p><p>“We’ll all go talk,” Agatha cuts in, giving Eros a steely glare. </p><p>Eros wrinkles his brow. “Sorry, who the hell are you?” </p><p>“Agatha,” she coldly replies. “Harkness.” </p><p>“Relation to Rio? I thought that’s what we were sharing here.” </p><p>“Her bodyguard,” she snaps. “Against your fucked-up family.” </p><p>She goes to stand and shift Nicky onto Lilia’s lap, but the little boy grips on tight. “No. I’m coming with you.” </p><p>“Nicky, this is a grown-up conversation, sweetheart.” </p><p>“No! No, you can’t leave,” he cries. “You can’t go.” He squeezes her middle even more tightly.</p><p>Agatha sighs, torn between the two threats currently facing her: to leave Rio alone with this man she didn't trust or to have her son distrust her even more than he evidently already did.</p><p>“I'll be okay,” Rio quietly assures her.</p><p>She looks her straight in the eye. “I let you go alone last time,” she reminds her, voice deeply serious and steady apart from the tiny hint of regret that creeps in. Last time, Thanos had left bruises on her neck. Last time, he'd slashed her calf. Last time, she almost didn’t come back. “I will not make that mistake again.”</p><p>Rio bites her bottom lip, a combination of relief and guilt pooling in her eyes as she briefly glances at Nicky. “If you’re sure…”</p><p>“Oh, I’m extremely fucking positive.” Agatha flicks another venomous glance at Eros before turning her head to whisper in Nicky’s hair. “Baby, why don’t you go back to the room with Ms. Lilia and have a nap?” </p><p>“I don’t—“ He sniffles against her, still clutching on. “—want to nap. I want—“ Another. “—to…to stay with you.” </p><p>“I know, I know. But you’re clearly tired.” <em>And stressed out. And confused. And it’s all my fault.</em> “I bet you I’ll be back by the time you wake up, and we can order ice cream, and we can have a talk, okay? Any scoops, any toppings, any…” She hesitates for a beat before reluctantly using the only piece of leverage she has. “…any questions you want me to answer.” </p><p>Nicky moves his head back just enough to look up at her, eyes red and puffy and narrowed and skeptical. “I want four.” </p><p>She's deeply impressed and annoyed that he's inherited her ruthless negotiation skills. She nods, though half will likely go uneaten. “Okay.”</p><p>“And I want whipped cream and sprinkles.” </p><p>She nods, though it will likely make him sick. “Okay.” </p><p>“And I don’t want you to lie.” </p><p>She nods slowly, though the prospect of telling him the truth about her back, about the past, about what was in her bottle and why she was so adamant about keeping it sealed shut is the most awful, painful thing she can think of. “Okay,” she agrees more quietly.</p><p>He looks at her for another second before letting out another whimper, burying himself against her once more. </p><p>Agatha purses her lips, risking another pleading glance at Lilia. The woman gives her a stern look in response — one that makes it clear she expects Agatha to make good on her promise — but nods in agreement.</p><p>She can’t help but scowl. God, couldn’t the old bat cut her some slack? It was bad enough that Agatha had opened up to her. It was even worse that she had opened up to Rio. Opening up to Nicky — to her sweet, innocent little boy she wanted to protect more than anything, who she wanted to be strong for — was fucking unthinkable. </p><p>It’s certainly unthinkable now, when she had so much else to think about with the Eros of it all.</p><p>She plants a lingering kiss on the top of Nicky’s head before taking his face in her hands, leaning forward so their noses are touching. “I love you,” she whispers. “More than anything in this whole wide world.”</p><p>His lip trembles. “I’m sorry I yelled. And pushed you. That was mean. I’ll go to timeout. I was— I just—"</p><p>“I know.” She thumbs a few tears from his cheeks. “I know. I understand." She understood better than anyone — his temper and his big, big feelings that came uncontrollably exploding out of him. "Just go have a rest with Ms. Lilia for me, okay?” He nods, and she kisses his forehead before setting him down.</p><p>“Come on, son,” Lilia says, offering her hand. “You want to hold it while we walk?”</p><p>He nods a little, shyly reaching out and taking it. His free hand goes to his mouth, sucking on his thumb for the first time in years.</p><p>Agatha sighs — another thing to deal with later — before turning to Rio. “Back to the quiet place?”</p><p>“Maybe the food court, considering the vomit of it all.”</p><p>“I’m sure the stupid waiter kid has cleaned it up by now, and the smell of Italian aquarium cuisine mixed with the look of this guy’s face might make me do it again.” Agatha nods toward Eros.</p><p>“Why'd you hurl the first time?” Eros asks. </p><p>“None of your beeswax.”</p><p>Rio rubs a hand over her face. "Then I don’t care.”</p><p>Agatha is too on guard to feel guilty about stressing her out. Rio had said he was the nicer of the brothers, but Rio tended to see too much good in people. See good when there was none. Thanos was proof (and maybe so was Agatha). </p><p>“All right,” Agatha says, making an executive decision. “Quiet place it is. More private that way.” She takes Rio’s hand — because she seemed to like it when she did that — and leads the charge as a show of dominance to Eros. </p><p>“We need the room,” she barks to the waiter kid, who is vacuuming the floor when they arrive. </p><p>He looks up, confused and petrified. “Wha—"</p><p>She promptly yanks the cord out of the wall. “We need the room. Leave.” </p><p>“But my boss said—“ One seething glare makes him gulp and skedaddle, nearly tripping on the cord in the process.</p><p>Agatha slams the door shut behind him before transitioning the glare to Eros once again. “So. Why the fuck are you here?”</p><p>“Well,” he starts, voice diplomatic, “my brother is dead.”</p><p>“Yeah, no shit, Sherlock — we’ve established that already. But he’d be dead if you were still in whatever hole you crawled out of, too.” </p><p>“The authorities wouldn’t tell us much apart from that. The resort either. Said it was technically still an ‘ongoing investigation.’” </p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Ab-fucking-surd. There’s nothing <em> to </em> investigate.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio gives her a warning look. “You can play guard dog, but please, let me talk.” </p><p>Agatha lifts her hands innocently before moving one to rest on Rio’s back as she takes the floor.</p><p>Rio looks to Eros. “You know how he treated me. Or snippets of it, at least. The control, the verbal abuse…”</p><p>“Yes,” he quietly confirms with a small, uncomfortable nod.</p><p>“Well, it…went beyond that. Far beyond that. He hit me. He—” She clears her throat, voice softer when she continues. “He did things to me that no human being should have to experience. I finally decided that I was going to leave him, and when I came to get my things, he tried to kill me.” Rio pulls the turtleneck down so her bruised throat is on full display, hand marks clearly visible.</p><p>“Shit, Rio,” Eros says, scraping a hand through his hair. “Shit.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She lets go of the shirt, the collar concealing the injury again. “He also threw a lamp at me.” She gestures to her bandaged leg, a bit of blood starting to leak through.</p><p>“So you fought back,” he reasons. “And you…you…” He can’t seem to bring himself to say it either.</p><p>“It was him or me, and he made it clear that if he couldn't have me, he'd make sure no one else could either."</p><p>Eros sighs, massaging his temples. “How did we get here? I mean, obviously, he was always kind of an asshole, but I never thought…” He trails off. </p><p>“You people never do,” Agatha can’t help but mumble, unable to bite her tongue entirely.</p><p>“‘Kind of an asshole’ is a gross underexaggeration,” Rio corrects, the space between her brows creasing in the first flickers of frustration. “Eros, he beat me — frequently. He raped me the day before, and that morning, he did it again, except that time he drugged me beforehand too as a nasty little cherry on top.”</p><p>“I had…I had no idea,” he says softly. “Why didn’t you tell me all this earlier? Why didn’t you make sure someone was there when you told him? Why didn’t—"</p><p>“Wrong fucking questions,” Agatha snaps. “Why didn’t <em> you </em> rub your two brain cells together and figure it out?” she interrogates, pointer finger on the hand not resting on Rio’s back harshly poking the middle of his chest. “Why didn’t <em> you </em> make sure to protect her?” Poke. “Why didn’t <em> you </em> hold the ugly fucking thumb accountable?” Poke.</p><p>“I— I didn’t know!” he defends. </p><p>“Bullshit. You grew up with the son of a bitch. You witnessed things when you saw them together. You were suspicious, but you were too much of a <em> coward </em> to actually <em>do</em> anything about it.”</p><p>Rio’s quiet for a long moment before she speaks again. “You don’t understand what it was like, Eros. Every time he hurt me, he’d gaslight me until I calmed down and forgave him. He isolated me — made me feel crazy. The only reason I got the courage to leave was because of a conversation I had with Agatha.”</p><p>He purses his lips, looking from Rio to Agatha and back to Rio again. “I…I believe you,” he says. “I do. I…he was always a bully. As kids, he’d give me wedgies and swirlies and noogies—“ </p><p>“Was he a villain in a John Hughes movie?” Agatha mutters under her breath. </p><p>“—but he’d always manage to get away with it.”</p><p>“Typical.” Rio rolls her eyes. “White man privilege.”</p><p>“More like 'mom’s favorite' privilege in this case.” Eros grimaces. “Speaking of which…”</p><p>Rio fixes her gaze on him again. “What?” she prompts, though it’s hesitant — like she’s not sure she really wants to know.</p><p>“My mother is…well…she’s not happy, to put it mildly. That her favorite son is gone.”</p><p>She crosses her arms. “Yeah, figures.”</p><p>“No, Rio…” he says slowly. “I don’t think you understand. She’s out for blood. <em>Your</em> blood.”</p><p>“With what money? Last time I heard, she didn’t get anything in the divorce.”</p><p>“With this money.” Eros sighs, pulling out his phone and turning his screen to show her a GoFundMe page titled JUSTICE FOR THANOS 🕊️ that’s already raised $34,025. “She made this yesterday. Got some women from her church group to share it on Facebook. Apparently, one of them has a cousin who’s a semi-big podcaster?” He shakes his head. “It’s not a lot right now — of money or buzz — but it’s only been a day, and it’s likely only going to snowball from here.”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flare, fearful and furious. “Well, how do you suggest we stop it? Can’t you get her to quit?”</p><p>He gives her a look. “You’ve met my mother. She doesn’t listen to me. She doesn’t listen to anyone. The only one she ever listened to was…well, my brother.”</p><p>“And the dumb fucker is dead,” Rio mumbles, massaging her temples. “Any chance she’d go to a cheap psychic I could bribe to say Thanos is at peace?”</p><p>“Lilia would do it for twenty bucks and a pack of smokes,” Agatha offers. </p><p>“No.” Eros shakes her head. “She’s super religious now. She even thinks <em>Harry Potter</em> is satanic.” </p><p>“<em>Harry Potter </em> <u> is</u> satanic,” Agatha counters. “Just not for the reason she thinks.”</p><p>“Of course she’s super religious now.” Rio shakes her head.</p><p>“Yeah. It’s…not my favorite advancement either,” Eros sympathizes.</p><p>“God, now I have to deal with an ultra-religious <em> and </em> racist boy mom.” Rio huffs. “I wish she’d shove a crucifix up her pale ass.”</p><p>Agatha blinks at the surprisingly vulgar comment — one that was much more likely to leave her own mouth — but runs a soothing hand up and down Rio’s back. “<em>We</em> will deal with a racist, ultra-religious boy mom,” she corrects. “Lucky for you, I’m well-qualified in this department.” And had just as much to lose from this monster-in-law’s smear campaign. If this bitch contributed to her losing custody… </p><p>“That so?” Eros asks, the question seemingly posed out of genuine curiosity. </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes at him but answers, “My own mother was a bible-beating bigot who said I acted like a boy," she explains. </p><p>The mere mention of Evanora — the reminder of the conversation she was soon going to need to have with Nicky — makes another wave of nausea crest over her.</p><p>Rio leans back into Agatha’s touch, looking at Eros. “How long can you hold her off?”</p><p>“I don’t…think I can put that genie back in the bottle,” he regrettably admits. “It’s already out there on the internet. I’m already here at her urging..."</p><p>She scoffs. “To do what? Revenge kill me?”</p><p>“Over my dead fucking body,” Agatha darkly mutters, a bit ironically. </p><p>“I mean, not literally,” Eros says. “Not physically. But kill your chances at freedom — or, at the very least, any chance at having a life free of harassment again? — that’s…the gist, I’m afraid.”</p><p>“Mm, well, she’s going to be sorely disappointed.” Rio raises her chin. “I know what evidence I have against him.”</p><p>“That doesn’t…always matter. Especially when it comes to powerful men,” Eros says. “I was old enough to remember my parents’ divorce — the way my dad dragged my mom’s name through the mud, painted her out to be some whore even though he was the one who constantly cheated on her. Sure, the fact that he was loaded and had an airtight prenup helped, but it didn’t do her any favors when it came time for the settlement. Even after that, we had to keep moving because people kept finding our house.”</p><p>Agatha bites the inside of her cheek. “I loathe to admit it, but he’s right.”</p><p>“A divorce settlement is vastly different from any case where expert witnesses like doctors and forensic psychologists testify about injuries and defensive wounds,” Rio reasons. “There’s very little arguing with biological evidence.”</p><p>“A real court might care about that, but the court of public opinion?” Agatha counters. “When there are rabid fucking Facebook moms involved? They don’t tend to care about facts or truth — that’s why they’re so easy to scam.” </p><p>“Easy to what?” Eros asks. </p><p>Agatha waves him off. “I don't have time for your dumb questions.”</p><p>Rio covers her face. “I hate all of this,” she grumbles. “It would’ve been easier if he’d just killed me.”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha says sternly, her gaze snapping over to her. “Look at me.” She waits to continue until Rio reluctantly drops her hands and makes eye contact. “Don’t say that. Don’t you ever say that. We are going. To figure. It out. Do you hear me?”</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath. “I guess,” she whispers. “I’m just so fucking tired.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, taking to tracing soothing circles on her spine. “I know, honey.” </p><p>Eros squints, pointing between them. “So, are you two, like…?” </p><p>Agatha whips her head to face him once again. “Choose your next words very fucking carefully.”</p><p>Eros lifts his palms. “No judgment. I roll with the LGBT.” </p><p>“What?” Agatha snaps, disgusted. “Don’t ever say that again. And don’t you <em> dare </em> say anything to your QAnon procreator. She’d have a fucking field day leveraging that.” </p><p>“Wasn’t planning on it. Though I don’t know what the hell I <em>am</em> supposed to report back..."</p><p>“Nothing?” Rio proposes, a hint of judgment seeping into her tone. “You’re a grown man.”</p><p>“She’s already called five times and sent thirty-one texts asking for updates since I’ve been here. She’s…persistent.” He swallows hard, pulling at his shirt collar. “And a little scary.”</p><p>“I repeat,” Rio says dryly, “you’re a grown man.”</p><p>“Eh, honestly, I’m not convinced.” Agatha examines the nails on her free hand with performative nonchalance. </p><p>He scoffs. “What’s that supposed to mean?” </p><p>“That I’d call you a little boy, but I don’t want to insult my six-year-old son like that.”</p><p>“Please.” Rio takes to rubbing her forehead again. “I can’t take another fight today.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha apologizes, half meaning it. Which was still more than she usually meant it.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll tell her that I haven’t been able to find you yet,” Eros muses. “Buy me some time. Or I could tell her I <em> did </em> find you and that you were in bad shape — mention your neck and your calf…though, I’m sure she’d probably find a way to spin it or claim you were faking it somehow…”</p><p>“It’s up to you,” Rio replies, voice heavy with exhaustion. “I’m so over today."</p><p>Agatha sighs. Just because she was over it did not mean it was going to go away. In fact, it was likely to get worse — a lot worse. </p><p>“Say you haven’t found her,” Agatha tells Eros. “She’ll think about it and text you later what, exactly, she wants you to say.” She turns to Rio. “Giving up any kind of control here because you’re overwhelmed is a mistake," she says, voice gentle.</p><p>Rio shoots her a desperate look. “I'm trying, Agatha,” she promises. “But I don’t know how much more I can handle right now.”</p><p>“Which is why you’re going to take a break and then get back to him,” she asserts. She looks at Eros. “And he isn’t going to say a goddamn thing before you do.”</p><p>“I can…reasonably hold her off for a few more hours,” he agrees. “The area’s big enough it wouldn’t be a stretch. Plus, she thinks I’m a little stupid.” </p><p>“Well, broken clock’s right twice a day,” Agatha mumbles. “Why did she send you, anyway? Instead of coming herself?” </p><p>“Oh, she’s terrified of dying in a plane crash.” </p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “But she doesn’t care if <em> you </em> die in a plane crash?” </p><p>Eros shrugs with a small, sad smile. “Pretty much.” </p><p>Agatha can’t help but feel the tiniest bit of tenderness toward him. Evanora, too, would’ve happily stuck her on a doomed aircraft.</p><p>Rio gives him a sympathetic look. “I’m sorry. I’m not exactly happy you’re here for…well, obvious reasons, but you deserve better than her.”</p><p>“Thanks, Rio,” he says softly. “You…you deserved better than him, too.”</p><p>She chews on the inside of her cheek. “I wish I’d been smart enough to realize that years ago.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to argue, but Eros cuts her off before she can. “You aced law school," he reminds her. "I don’t think it’s about smart. If it is, the rest of us are screwed.”</p><p>“Once again, I have to agree with the floppy-haired bastard,” Agatha says, though there’s a noticeable lack of vitriol in her tone now.</p><p>“It still <em> feels </em> like I’m stupid,” Rio admits. “Like I’m having the biggest, meanest joke in the world played on me.”</p><p>“Well, I’m not laughing,” Eros promises. “And I’m not…blaming you either. I…I want to help.”</p><p>“Then leave her alone,” Agatha answers. Normally, she’d be reluctant to do that — answer on her behalf, especially in a way that could be perceived as isolating her like Thanos so often did — but she’s trying to help her, too. Solve some of her decision paralysis. She looks to Rio, checking that this was okay. “For now, at least. Yeah?”</p><p>Rio gives a little nod in response, and Eros purses his lips, considering. “Okay,” he relents after a moment. “Text me later.” </p><p>“She will,” Agatha promises. “I’ll make sure of it.” </p><p>“Maybe we could have breakfast tomorrow or something?” Eros suggests.</p><p>“Don’t push your luck. You’re still on the thinnest of ice.” </p><p>“But I haven’t fallen through yet,” he points out. </p><p>A beat. “No,” Agatha admits. “No, I suppose you’re right.”</p><p>He rubs the back of his neck. “I’ll see you later, Rio. It was nice to meet you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “No, it wasn’t.” </p><p>“No,” he agrees, the tiniest ghost of a smile on his face. “I suppose you’re right,” he echoes her words. </p><p>Once he leaves, Agatha turns to Rio. “You ready to get out of this cursed-ass aquarium?”</p><p>Rio nods vehemently, letting out a breath of relief at the mere thought. “Please.”</p><p>“All right,” she says, shifting the hand on her back to wrap around her for support instead and walking them out of the room. </p><p>The waiter kid’s eyes get big as he nearly runs into them. Third time, he senses, is not the charm today. </p><p>“Don’t worry,” Agatha says gruffly. “We’re leaving.”</p><p>He nods, relaxed — something that doesn’t last long when she calls over her shoulder, “And we’re giving you one star on Yelp!”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head as she opens the main door, the sunlight mercifully hitting them once again — getting them out of the seemingly warped space where she felt she lived a hundred lives. “Worst fucking aquarium I’ve ever been to.”</p>

<p>The pit in Agatha’s stomach seems to get larger with each slow step she and Rio walk back to the resort. She tells herself she’s taking her time because Rio is under duress and needs some air. She knows, deep down, it’s because she’s delaying the inevitable. </p><p>“I know you’re not a betting woman,” she starts, trying to keep her voice light as she unlocks the door to her room and quietly pushes it open. Nicky is not in any of the common areas, which means he’s probably still napping in his bedroom. Small miracles. “But what are the odds my kid’s forgotten about our little deal?”</p><p>“Probably around zero?” Rio admits as they make their way into the master suite.</p><p>“Yeah,” she agrees as she shuts the door behind them, unable to keep up the nonchalant facade. “Yeah, you’re probably right.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio says, giving her arm an encouraging squeeze. “You can do it.” She immediately strips the borrowed turtleneck off, breathing an audible sigh of relief as she slips her oversized pajama shirt back on.</p><p>“How, Rio?” Agatha asks, breathing out a humorless laugh as she flops back onto the bed, covering her face with her hands. “How am I supposed to do this?”</p><p>“You just do, Agatha,” she says gently. “You just tell him."</p><p>“But I don’t want to scare him. I don’t want him picturing his mother—" Her voice cracks on the word. She can’t even bring herself to say it now. How the hell was she going to tell her sweet little boy? To tell him of her scars would almost certainly scar him in the process.</p><p>“You don’t have to go into the gory details,” Rio reasons. “There’s a balance between sharing every little thing and completely shutting him out from your past.”</p><p>Agatha has never been good at balance, living only in extremes. She attempts to clear the emotion from her throat, it only half-working. “He can’t think that I’m weak,” she quietly insists. “He needs to know I’m strong — that I can protect him.”</p><p>“Admitting that something happened to you doesn’t make you weak. Does he think I’m weak because of what Thanos did to me? No. Now apply that logic to yourself.”</p><p>“It’s not the same. I’m his mom. I’ve spent my entire life shielding him from that — from her.” She purses her lips, looking at Rio. “Knowing will hurt him. And <em>she</em> does <em>not</em> get to hurt him.”</p><p>“She won’t, Agatha. She <em>can’t</em>. She’s dead. What <em>will</em> hurt him is you icing him out. You owe him the truth — at least enough of it so he understands.”</p><p>She takes a deep breath, pushing herself up so she’s sitting against the headboard. “He is the best thing in my life, Rio. The best thing that’s ever happened to me. And he is kind, and he is pure, and he is <em>good</em>.”</p><p>“Yes, and he deserves your honesty.”</p><p>“Well, honestly, I’m scared, all right?” she snaps before turning her head toward the window in shame — at admitting that, at letting it explode out of her.</p><p>“And that makes sense,” Rio replies, her voice as calm as Agatha’s is heightened. “It’s a valid, normal response, but you need to face that fear.”</p><p>Agatha takes another breath — shakier this time — eyes burning as they stare out at the sea. “What if he looks at me differently?” she whispers, so quietly that Rio likely has to strain to hear. She somehow feels much too far away, even though she’s only standing on the other side of the bed. She wants her to come snuggle up against her, to wrap an arm around her belly, to rest her head in the crook of her neck.</p><p>But despite their moment at the aquarium, Agatha still doesn’t know how to ask for any of those things, and besides, Rio doesn’t seem keen on giving them to her even if she did.</p><p>She runs a hand over her face. “Well, that happens sometimes. But even if it does, I don’t think it’ll be negative. He’ll probably think you’re brave.”</p><p>Agatha looks back at her and nods slowly, detecting a bit of impatience. Resentment maybe. God, she feels stupid. She feels so fucking stupid. And more than that, she feels her walls slowly creeping back up.</p><p>“You know, if you’re tired of listening to me, Rio, you can just say that,” she says, voice impressively restrained from all the…the <em>feelings</em> she’s feeling. “I get you’re exhausted — and understandably so — but believe it or not, I am actually baring my fucking soul here because I thought that’s what <em>you</em> wanted. I thought that’s what <em>you</em> meant by the whole ‘communication' thing. But if you’d rather I shut up and suck it up, believe me, I am more than happy to comply. Makes it much easier for me.” She slaps her hands down on her legs before swinging them over the bed. “Why don’t you take a nap while I do this, hm?”</p><p>It's a shitty, passive-aggressive thing to say, but Rio lets it go. She sighs again, her voice stopping Agatha from leaving the room. “I appreciate that you’re communicating with me — I do. I’m grateful you trust me enough to open up,” she promises. “That said, I <em>am</em> tired. I’m burnt out from doing damage control all day, and the quality of my reassurance isn’t what you deserve. That doesn’t mean I don't still want to listen.”</p><p>Any kind of reassurance is more than Agatha’s ever really gotten. More than she’s ever really allowed anyone to give. More than she probably deserves as well. </p><p>“Okay," Agatha says slowly. She crosses her arms protectively over her chest, feeling untethered and unsure. She loathes both. “I don’t— What do you want to do then? I— What do you want me to do?”</p><p>“I want you to keep opening up. I want to know you, even the hard, ugly parts. I want you to keep talking so I can listen, but I may not be able to verbally respond. That doesn’t mean I hate you — it just means I don’t have the words.”</p><p>Agatha chews on the inside of her cheek, immediately apprehensive at the thought. “I don’t…I don’t think I can do that,” she admits. “It’ll feel too much like the silent treatment. I…” She swallows hard. She might as well practice saying this shit, she supposes, considering Nicky is still up next. “She used to love that punishment, too.” She digs her thumb into her arm in a desperate attempt to ground herself. “Are you— I mean…is it okay? If I don’t want to do that?”</p><p>“That’s okay.” Rio nods. “That’s perfectly okay. If you want, you can lie down with me for a while, and we can just be.”</p><p>Agatha blinks. Was she capable of that? Of just being? She’s not totally sure. If the brief time she attempted it in the aquarium directly before vomiting was any indication, she wasn’t, though she supposes she could try again. </p><p>She should probably wake Nicky — she did promise him they’d talk right when she got back — but she can’t bring herself to do so just yet. As much as Rio had tried to soothe her anxieties, she knows that this conversation will change things between them in some irrevocable way. She wants to preserve his blissful ignorance on the subject for as long as she possibly can, even if that’s just hours now. Just minutes or seconds, even. </p><p>“All right,” she whispers, lowering herself back onto the mattress and patting the space next to her. “Come on, then. Just be with me.”</p><p>Rio does. She snuggles up against her, wraps an arm around her belly, and rests her head in the crook of her neck without Agatha even having to ask.</p><hr/><p>Agatha doesn’t manage to fall asleep in the next couple of hours, though she doesn’t throw up again either, which she supposes is some kind of bare-minimum progress. The sound of Rio breathing beside her does admittedly lull her into a slightly calmer state.</p><p>Eventually, there’s a light knock on the door — one that unmistakably belongs to her son. Rio sits up a bit as Agatha takes a deep breath, buying herself a few more seconds of that sweet ‘before’ until she’s forced to say, “Come in.” </p><p>Nicky slowly pushes the door open, his rabbit clutched in one hand, the other hovering near his mouth. Right. The thumb-sucking had made its return. “Ms. Lilia said she had to leave to meet someone for dinner.” </p><p>Agatha raises a brow, looking at the clock: 4:08. “Early bird special, huh? Checks out.”</p><p>“No, not a bird…” He wrinkles his brows, confused. “She said it was with a dashing gentlewoman she met playing shuffleboard.” </p><p>Agatha’s other brow lifts now, too. She hadn’t necessarily pinned the old broad as a fellow fruit. “Huh. Interesting.”</p><p>Nicky stares at her blankly, and she takes another deep breath, opening her arms. “Come here, baby.”</p><p>Nicky wastes no time padding over, leaping on the bed and nestling into her arms. Agatha shoots Rio a vaguely panicked look as he settles in and hopes to whatever higher power probably wasn’t out there that the few hours of rest had given her a bit more energy. That she would be able to support her through this somehow. It’s terrifying how much she needs her in this moment. How much she seems to need her in general now.</p><p>Rio responds by reaching over and rubbing her arm, which gives Agatha the courage to clear her throat and run a hand through Nicky’s hair — the action as much to ground herself as to comfort him. “I told you that you could ask me anything you wanted, so…” </p><p>“Why do you have lines on your back?” he wastes no time asking, the Harkness bluntness winning out. Usually, she’d be thrilled they seemed to be kicking the Maximoff influence’s ass, but now… </p><p>“Well, they’re…scars. Kind of like that little line you have on your chest from when you got surgery as a baby.” She touches her finger to his sternum. </p><p>He tilts his head. “So you got surgery? Are— are you sick?” His eyes well with tears. “Are you gonna die? Like Sienna’s mom from my class? She had cancer.” </p><p>“No, honey — nothing like that.” She <em>was</em> sick, probably. In the head and in the soul. But that’s not what he’s asking. “Someone…someone gave me them — a long time ago — to hurt me.” </p><p>His mouth curves into a deep frown. “But why?” he asks softly, eyes so wide and earnest and innocent. “Why would someone do that?” </p><p>She feels a sob threaten to creep up her throat and desperately swallows it down. She couldn’t answer that, not just because she didn’t want to but because she didn’t know. She didn’t fucking know.</p><p>“Because some people aren’t very nice,” Rio jumps in to explain. “That's why being kind is so important. It helps make up for the people who aren’t.”</p><p>“Like that scary man you were with at breakfast?” Nicky asks.</p><p>Agatha sees Rio clench her jaw and swallow hard. “Mhm.”</p><p>Nicky looks back at Agatha. “Did <em>he</em> give you the marks?” </p><p>“No.” She shakes her head. “No, it wasn’t him.” </p><p>“Then who?” </p><p>She closes her eyes for a moment, tilting her head toward the ceiling. God, this was killing her. Telling him about how she got the scars was proving almost as painful as getting them in the first place. Was like reopening the wounds once again. </p><p>“Do you remember what I told you about your grandmother? When you asked why she couldn’t come to grandparents’ day at school?” </p><p>He nods. “You said that she was dead like Mom’s parents, but that I shouldn’t feel sad about her because she was mean anyway.”</p><p>“Yes.” She opens her eyes again, forcing herself to look at him. “She did it when I got in trouble. Way, way back when I was still little like you.” </p><p>His eyes pool with confusion and distress in equal measure. “But…you and Mom don’t do that.” </p><p>“No,” Agatha vehemently agrees. “And we never, ever, <em>ever</em> would,” she promises. “You don’t have to worry about that. Not ever, do you understand? No matter what you do, nobody will ever raise a hand or anything else to you." </p><p>He nods a little, relieved by this, though concern is still etched into his features. “Why wouldn’t she just send you to timeout?” he asks, voice small. </p><p>Agatha shrugs a shoulder and gives him a sad smile. “I guess she thought I was really, really bad,” she says quietly.</p><p>“But she wasn’t,” Rio firmly cuts in. “<em>Her</em> mom was the one who was really, really bad. <em>Your</em> mom was just a kid — she didn’t deserve it. No one does.”</p><p>Nicky nods in fervent agreement, a few tears shaking loose. “You’re not bad, Mama.”</p><p>Agatha can’t manage to swallow down this sob, it leaving her throat without her consent. She covers her mouth as if that’ll change anything. </p><p>“You’re not bad,” Nicky says again, shifting so he’s hugging her tight. </p><p>“Okay,” she whispers, carding her fingers through his locks. </p><p>“You’re not,” he insists. </p><p>“Yes, I heard you.” </p><p>“But you don’t believe me.” </p><p>To disagree would be to lie, and that’s how they ended up here in the first place. So she tells him a truth instead. “I want to, honey. I want to."</p><p>Rio moves her hand up to Agatha’s shoulder, giving it a comforting squeeze.</p><p>Agatha takes another shuddering inhale, giving her a nod of thanks. “Do you have any more questions right now?” she asks Nicky. </p><p><em>Please say no, please say no, please say—</em></p><p>“Yes.” </p><p><em>Fuck.</em> </p><p>“All right. What is it?” </p><p>He pulls his head away from her stomach, tilting his chin to look up at her. “How do I make you not hurt anymore?” </p><p>Her heart simultaneously aches and feels like it’s going to burst from her chest. “You want to know a secret, my love?” she whispers. He nods, eyes wide and curious. “You already do. Just by being my baby. Just by being you. Every single day.” She places a kiss on his nose. </p><p>“You promise?” </p><p>“I promise. I don’t want you to worry about me, okay?” She pokes his chest gently. “It’s my job to take care of you — not the other way around.” </p><p>“But someone should take care of you, too, since your mama didn’t.”</p><p>“That’s why your mom has other adults in her life who can help,” Rio explains.</p><p>“Like you?” Nicky asks.</p><p>Rio opens her mouth. Shuts it. Then opens it again. “That’s up to her,” she admits, avoiding eye contact with Agatha. “I can’t make her pick anyone, including me. She has to want that.”</p><p>“She wants that,” he assures her before looking back at his mother. “Right, Mama?” </p><p>Agatha purses her lips before giving a small nod, avoiding eye contact as well. “Right,” she quietly confirms.</p><p>Rio responds by giving Agatha’s shoulder another squeeze before lying back down.</p><p>“You’re going to sleep?” Nicky frowns. </p><p>“She’s had a long day,” Agatha tells him. </p><p>“So did I, but I’m not tired anymore. And I already took a long, long nap just like you said.” </p><p>“You did,” she agrees with a nod. “Tell you what, why don’t the two of us go get some dinner and that ice cream I promised you and let Ms. Rio rest by herself for a bit?” </p><p>“Four scoops <em>and</em> whipped cream <em>and</em> sprinkles?” </p><p>“That is what I agreed to.”</p><p>“Okay.” </p><p>Agatha turns to Rio. “What do you want us to bring you back? And, no, I will not take ‘nothing’ for an answer.”</p><p>Rio chews on her lip for a moment, ultimately deciding she’s too tired to fight her on the subject. “Pasta? And some garlic bread?”</p><p>“You got it,” she promises. Chicken parm, she decides. She’d get her chicken parm on a bed of spaghetti noodles. She’d seemed to enjoy that the other night. </p><p>Agatha stands up and helps lower Nicky to the ground, awkwardly hovering by the bed for a moment before leaning down and planting a light, uncharacteristically domestic kiss on Rio’s cheek. “Back soon,” she vows, turning and walking out the door before she can react.</p><p>The sun is setting by the time the two of them return. The first hour is spent at dinner, the second getting ice cream and eating it on the beach, and the third indulging Nicky with a dip in the hotel pool despite the fact that he had not only <em>not</em> waited the recommended 30 minutes after eating to swim but had shoved a truly impressive-slash-ludicrous amount of dessert into his tiny body. </p><p>The fourth hour is spent doing…well, a notably less enjoyable activity — one Rio gets informed of immediately upon their return, Agatha's mouth flattened into a thin, agitated line as she holds her phone out to her. </p><p>“My ex called,” she tells her. “She’s demanding to speak with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” Rio blinks, a little taken aback. This is…not what she expected, but then again, no part of this vacation had been. No part of her life, really, has been what she anticipated for herself growing up, for better (Agatha) and for far, far worse (Thanos). “Okay.”</p><p>“I’m sorry — I tried.” Agatha sighs as Rio takes the phone from her. “<em>Trust me</em>, I tried. The bitch insisted.” </p><p>“I can still <em>hear you</em>!” Wanda yells from the other end of the line. </p><p>Agatha leans forward so her mouth is closer to the receiver. “<em>Good</em>!”</p><p>“It’s okay, Agatha,” Rio reassures her, though she’s not entirely sure that it is. She’s startled and woefully unprepared for this conversation, but she can’t handle witnessing another argument right now.</p><p>“I’m Wanda,” the woman greets once the phone is to Rio’s ear. “Agatha’s ex-wife. Which I’m sure you’ve figured out, but it felt rude not to say. Could you do me a favor and tell her not to eavesdrop? She’s not going to listen to me if I ask, and I want to have an actual conversation with you without her butting in every two seconds with some snarky commentary.”</p><p>She’d really rather not do this alone, but Wanda admittedly does make a decent point — she can’t imagine a world in which this talk is even remotely productive with Agatha involved. Rio gives a little nod, feeling stupid when she realizes Wanda obviously can’t see it, and glances up. “Could you not listen in?”</p><p>Agatha immediately opens her mouth to argue, but Rio cuts her off before she can with a firm, “Agatha. Please. I got this.”</p><p>Agatha closes her mouth and contemplates for a long moment. “Fine,” she reluctantly relents. “<em>Fine</em>. I’ll be in the living room with Nicky, no doubt being roped into watching some boring nature documentary, if you need me.” She leans in closer to the phone. “You better not act like a psychotic bitch!” she warns. </p><p>“Don’t worry — those are both <em>your</em> specialties!” Wanda yells back. </p><p>“Ginger cunt!” </p><p>“I went blonde, like, two years ago!”</p><p>Agatha bares her teeth and hisses before rapidly switching gears to give Rio a sympathetic look and leaving the room. </p><p>“Sorry you had to hear that,” Wanda apologizes. “I’d say I must be making a terrible first impression, but I’m sure Agatha already took care of that — painted quite the picture of me.”</p><p>“She…has,” Rio confesses, unable to think of a good reason to come up with a lie that Wanda almost certainly wouldn’t believe anyway. “But I take things like that with a grain of salt.”</p><p>“That’s…refreshing,” she admits, a trace of surprise evident in her tone. “Agatha’s a very good talker. She has a talent for making people fall under her spell when she wants to.”</p><p>“I’m sure.” And she is. Rio has absolutely no doubt about that. It had happened to her, after all. But it wasn’t that simple. Agatha — she wasn’t that simple. “I feel like I can see through her, though,” she adds.</p><p>“Hm,” Wanda hums, clearly skeptical, though she quickly moves on, evidently not wanting to risk detonating that particular bomb of a topic at the moment. “You’re probably wondering how I even know about you.”</p><p>“News reports combined with Nicky?” Rio guesses.</p><p>“Facebook post, actually,” Wanda corrects. Rio can practically hear the suspicious narrowing of her eyes across the telephone line. “You and Agatha in a blurry photo attached to some fundraiser someone forwarded me. Nicky didn’t say a word until I whipped out my mom voice today and forced it out of him, which I’m really <em>not</em> thrilled about. She shouldn’t be encouraging him to keep secrets from me.”</p><p>“I agree with that much,” Rio concedes, “but I’ve been a little preoccupied with almost being murdered.” She can’t help the smallest bit of frustration that creeps out. Had everyone forgotten what she’d been through? Had it not absolved her from being unable to perfectly solve everyone else’s more trivial problems?</p><p>Wanda’s tone prickles to match hers as she retorts, “And murder<em>ing</em>?” </p><p>It’s not the first time someone had thrown that word around — reacted like that — but it punches Rio in the gut all the same. She wonders if blaming, minimizing comments like that will always sting this badly or if she will eventually grow numb to them like she did with Thanos over the course of all those hellish years. </p><p>Wanda speaks again before she can respond. “I’m sorry.” She sighs. “That was uncalled for.”</p><p>Yes, it sure the fuck was. And despite the apology, Rio isn’t ready to let it go that easily. Rio is tired of letting shit go so easily.</p><p>“It was also inaccurate,” she points out. “I’m a lawyer, and legally, what I did was acting in self-defense.”</p><p>“I’m not arguing that it wasn’t.”</p><p>“Really? Because it kind of sounds like that’s exactly what you were doing.”</p><p>“No,” Wanda says, and Rio thinks she can detect some genuine shame and remorse in her voice. “Agatha filled me in, and it...seemed like she was being honest for once in her life. So I get why you did it. It must have been horrifying, going through all that. Truly.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio blinks again, caught off guard by Wanda for the second time in the span of five minutes. “Sorry. I’m…getting used to people not believing me.”</p><p>“Well, that’s awful.”</p><p><em>That’s putting it pretty fucking mildly</em>, she thinks. “It is,” she says.</p><p>Wanda clears her throat. “My son…my son has also been through a lot of awful.”</p><p>Rio has a pretty good idea of where this is headed, so she stays quiet, waiting for her to continue.</p><p>“Between hospital visits and the divorce, things haven't been…easy for him, you know? He’s endured so much — far more than a child his age should have had to — and the last thing I would want is to introduce more stress and confusion and chaos into his life.”</p><p>Yup. There it was.</p><p>“I can assure you that’s not my intention,” Rio promises as patiently as she can manage. “I have nothing but empathy for what he’s been through.”</p><p>“And I appreciate that.” Wanda pauses, seemingly choosing her words carefully. “But things don’t always go according to plan. All the empathy in the world won’t keep him from being exposed to this — by being affected. Can you understand where I’m coming from?”</p><p>Rio can’t help but soften a little at that. Of course, she could understand wanting to protect Nicky. She’d been doing just that since the first time she met him, when he was a scared, lost boy wandering the beach without his mother. </p><p>“I do,” Rio confirms. “But no one has said anything beyond what a six- or seven-year-old should know or comprehend.”</p><p>“Six,” Wanda says. “You had it right the first time — he’s only six.” </p><p>It’s undeniably a bit petty, but Rio decides to let it go this time. “Basically, he knows that someone hurt me and that I fought back. That’s all.”</p><p>Rio hears Wanda scrape a hand through her hair. “What happens when he starts having nightmares about some monster hurting <em>him</em>? What happens when one of the kids at school gets wind of this fundraiser or sees something on the news and starts asking him questions that <em>aren’t</em> age-appropriate? What happens when he gets called to testify as a witness in your case?”</p><p>Rio rubs a hand across her face, choosing not to risk revealing that the first one of her concerns had already come to fruition. “Kids will be kids no matter what,” she says instead. “All I can control is what I tell him, which, again, I can assure you has never crossed any kind of line and never will. As I said, I’m a lawyer, and the chances of him being subpoenaed are low.”</p><p>“Low is not the same as impossible, especially in a case this high-profile,” Wanda counters. “And I don’t want him dragged into a media circus that, frankly, feels a bit inevitable.”</p><p>Rio sighs, already exhausted by the circle they seemed to be starting to go in. “I don’t have all the answers,” she admits. “I wish I did. I wish more than anything that this weren’t happening. I care about your son, and the last thing I would ever want to do is hurt him."</p><p>“Well…I’m glad we can agree on that.” She takes a deep breath. “Look, I’m not dumb enough to try to threaten you and Agatha into ending things. God knows nobody tells Agatha what to do, least of all me.”</p><p>Rio forces herself to refrain from breathing a sigh of relief. There was always another shoe somewhere just waiting to drop. “That’s true.”</p><p>“Plus, telling her she can’t do something all but guarantees she’s going to. She's fueled by spite.”</p><p>“I can tell.”</p><p>Wanda’s voice gets that narrowed-eye quality to it again. “But you’re still drawn to her,” she observes.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says simply, once again seeing no reason to deny something fairly obvious.</p><p>There’s a long, long beat of silence before Wanda speaks again. “Do you love her?”</p><p>There’s an even longer beat before Rio replies. “I don’t know,” she lies. “I think so,” she tries again. Yeah. Yeah, that feels more truthful. That feels more honest than she’s ever been about something, and she’s surprised by just how much it hurts — how raw it makes her feel. “I care about her a lot, but that’s too big a question for me to answer at the moment. To answer so soon.”</p><p>It’s a ‘yes’ with more fear and hesitation — more words and technicalities — and they both know it. </p><p>Wanda grows quiet once more before she speaks again. “I loved her, too,” she admits, voice tinged with sadness. With her own exhaustion. “Which is why I need you to promise you’ll be careful. I know she seems very exciting, but you’re very…fragile right now. And I don’t say that to infantilize you — you’re clearly a strong, intelligent woman — I…” She takes a deep breath. “I know what it’s like is all. When Agatha Harkness swoops in when you’re at your most vulnerable and sucks you into her orbit. When she turns your entire world upside down before you even realize it’s happening.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio says softly. She knows what that’s like in the most extreme, terrible sense with Thanos — knows the signs now, even if it took nearly dying to develop that hindsight. “I’m sorry things ended so poorly between you.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Wanda says, her tone sincere. “You think I’d be used to things falling apart by now — my parents died when I was young, then I miscarried twins with my high school sweetheart before he died, too — but…” She breathes out a small, humorless laugh. “God. Sorry. I don’t know what on earth possessed me to tell you that. This whole situation is…odd.”</p><p>“It’s all right — I don’t mind.” And she doesn’t. She’s even a little grateful for the more complete picture Wanda is offering her. The gaps Agatha had left that she’s filling in. Rio has always valued information, found comfort in knowledge and figuring out the rules of people. “I’m sorry you went through all of that.”</p><p>“Thanks,” she repeats, voice thicker with emotion now. “I could never…get her to do that with me, you know? Open up? Sometimes, I felt like I caught glimpses of her, but I don’t think I ever saw the whole thing.” Wanda sniffles. “It’s not like I’m so great at it either, but I tried with her. I tried really hard for a really long time.”</p><p>“I can imagine,” Rio sympathizes. “She’s a tough nut to crack, not to mention chock-full of self-loathing and bravado.”</p><p>“‘Tough nut to smash,’” Wanda quotes. “She insisted that’s what the phrase was — I’m fairly certain just to piss me off. Not even close to the stupidest thing we ever argued about, mind you. I think she <em>enjoyed</em> it,” she bitterly recalls. “Got off on it in some twisted way.” She sighs again before continuing. “And yeah, I know, ‘When you're born in a burning house, you think the whole world is on fire,’ but I tried so many times to hand her a hose, only for her to turn it on full blast and spray me in the face with it. It’s almost like she <em>wanted</em> the flames to consume her.”</p><p>“I think part of that is the self-loathing,” Rio reasons. “That doesn’t excuse how she hurt you, but I know people like her. She’s so scared of what it means to heal and make peace with her trauma that she indulges in self-harming behavior — the kind where she yells and screams and pushes people away.”</p><p>“I <em>know</em> that. I do,” Wanda responds, the slightest bit defensive. “I was with her for years — I know that better than anyone.” The small edge in her tone dissipates, leaving nothing but sad surrender in its wake. “I just…I had hope that eventually, not everything would end in a fight. That eventually — after bending over backwards time and time again to earn her trust — she would lean into me instead. That eventually, I would be enough for her.”</p><p>Perhaps it’s strange, but Rio finds herself feeling some sort of compassion for her girlfriend’s (was Agatha even technically, officially her girlfriend?) ex-wife. Finds herself saying “I’m sorry” and meaning it.</p><p>“It is what it is,” Wanda replies with another small sniffle. “Anyway, I just wanted you to know I’m not a monster. I’m a mother, and I would do absolutely anything for my son, including unpleasant things like suing my ex-wife for custody when she’s unable to properly care for him and vetting the random women she allows to sleep next to him without so much as consulting or even informing me.”</p><p>The comment hits her in the stomach again, though this time, it’s more from worry than annoyance, her face growing hot with nerves and a smidge of shame. <em>She</em> probably <em>did</em> look like something of a monster from Wanda’s perspective. The first things she learned about Rio, after all, were that she was sneaking around with her ex-wife and son and that she had ended someone’s life. “I’m sorry,” she repeats. “I never meant to hurt anyone.”</p><p>Her voice must be dripping with anxiety, as Wanda softens. “Hey,” she says. “It’s okay. My frustration lies with Agatha and her increasingly selfish, irresponsible choices — not with you.” A beat. “Are <em>you</em> okay?” she asks more gently still. "As I said, I know these circumstances are strange and that Agatha is not a particularly easy person, and that's without all the other...complications you're dealing with."</p><p>Rio’s not sure what compels her to be so forthcoming, but she finds herself telling the truth again. “I’m so fucking tired,” she confesses, breathing out a humorless laugh. “I don’t think I can do this much longer.”</p><p>“Do…what exactly? Be with Agatha? Because if that’s the case, you should cut it off now before you’re in too deep with her. And before Nicky is in too deep with you. I don’t want him getting…attached if you don’t plan on sticking around.”</p><p>The burning in her face turns from apprehension to irritation. “For fuck’s sake, no," she snaps. "It’s not about Agatha. It’s not about Nicky. It’s about my fucking life. Agatha would kill me for this, but I just want to die. I just want this all to go away. I think maybe everyone would be better off if I were dead. I know it’d sure as hell be easier for me.”</p><p>There’s another long, long beat of silence — long enough for Rio to start catching her breath again after her unexpected rant and grow increasingly mortified for baring her soul to this stranger. One who was already primed to hate her. </p><p>How could she be so fucking stupid? Agatha was terrified that Wanda was going to try to use the situation to take Nicky from her. By spilling the fact that she was suicidal, she’d offered her ammunition on a silver fucking platter. She has the ironic urge to slam her head into the bedpost.</p><p>But Wanda surprises her for a third time when she finally speaks again. “Got it,” she says, voice soft. “I apologize. I misunderstood.” </p><p>There’s yet another stretch of quiet, then — longer still — before she continues. “I made…an attempt once,” Wanda admits. It’s clear from her voice that this is a subject she doesn’t talk about much. Doesn’t talk about <em>ever</em>, maybe. “After the miscarriage and my husband…” she trails off before clearing her throat. “So I won’t pretend to know exactly how you feel, but I know how <em>that</em> feels. That emptiness. That loneliness. That…endless nothingness. It’s like being crushed under a mountain.” </p><p>Wanda takes a deep breath. “For what it’s worth — which may not be much considering I don’t really know you, and you don’t really know me — I don’t think anyone would be better off. I already know two people certainly wouldn’t. Nicky seems to adore you, and I’ve…I’ve never heard Agatha talk about someone the way she talked about you.” There’s a bittersweetness to the revelation that makes Rio ache in a way she can’t quite comprehend.</p><p>Rio sucks in sharply, tears pricking at her eyes. For once, someone hadn’t told her to stop. Hadn’t berated her for the urge. Had tried to understand. </p><p>“I don’t know if I ever actually could,” Rio admits. “Even outside of Agatha and Nicky, I know my dad would be devastated. I’m just—” She pauses, taking another shaky inhale. “Everything feels so hard. I’m having to relearn how to live because I let some fucker abuse me for almost a decade. Everything hurts.”</p><p>“Abuse isn’t something that someone invites or allows,“ Wanda gently points out. “And as someone who’s had to relearn how to live four times — and that’s a conservative estimate — it <em>is</em> hard. And it <em>does</em> hurt. Some days, it might hurt even worse than it does right now,” she confesses. “But you know what? Some days, it’ll hurt a little less. And some rare, fleeting, tiny moments, it won’t even hurt at all. You have to live for those. You have to <em>keep</em> living for those,” she says, voice almost soothing. “You know?”</p><p>“I’m scared that he’s broken me,” Rio finds herself whispering.</p><p>“He may have broken parts,” Wanda concedes. “But they’re not beyond repair. You can always figure out how to piece yourself back together.”</p><p>Rio purses her lips. “I want to try,” she promises. “But like I said, I’m so tired.” A pause. “Does that part get better?”</p><p>“In my experience — which I know is not exactly your experience — yes, it does. Eventually, the exhaustion won’t feel so bone-deep and persistent — so all-consuming. But there’s only one way to find out, right?”</p><p>“I suppose so,” Rio relents. She’s not quite sold, but maybe she’s getting there. Perhaps she will be able to get there. “Right now, it’s all just so heavy.”</p><p>“Listen, why don’t you…take my number?” Wanda suggests, a little awkward but sincere. “Maybe I can help you…learn to carry it. Somehow. If you’d want that. It’d probably be smart for you to have it anyway if you’re going to be spending time with Agatha and Nicky.”</p><p>“Yeah. Yeah, okay.” Rio nods despite once again knowing Wanda can’t see. The action is just for her — a motion to help her process all of this. She was still learning how to do that — things for her own sake and no one else’s. “I think that would be…nice.”</p><p>“Please use it, all right? If you feel like you want to give up and you don’t feel like you can talk to anyone else...” she trails off again. “Just promise that you’ll use it if you need, okay? I wish…I wish someone had told me the same back then.”</p><p>“Thank you,” she responds after a moment. “I…I really appreciate that.”</p><p>“Be good to Nicky,” Wanda says, voice serious but not exactly threatening.</p><p>“I will.” </p><p>“And Rio?” she adds, tone softening considerably. “Make Agatha be good to you.”</p><p>“I will,” she repeats, quieter this time. “I will.”</p>

<p>Nicky falls asleep within five minutes of the nature documentary, so he either finds it as dull as Agatha does or is as tired as Rio is. Agatha conveniently decides to take this as a sign from the universe, concocting a plan to eavesdrop as she carries him to bed. Considering Rio and Ginger Bitch took precautions to avoid this, the solution she comes up with is, unfortunately, imperfect. Which is to say she’s standing with her ear to the door like she’s in some ridiculous sitcom. </p><p>Wanda used to love those stupid shows. She still loves those stupid shows, probably, not that Agatha gives a shit. She’d indulged her by watching them with her on occasion, during that sliver of time when they were still something resembling happy together, even though the inane laugh tracks and caring parents and cheerful children pissed Agatha off. The Disney movies Evanora would put on for her on the rare, rare occasion she was in a halfway decent mood — the ones about talking animals and fairy godmothers — seemed to her less far-fetched.</p><p>The door’s thickness does not make it easy — or frequently possible — to hear the actual words Rio is saying to Wanda, but she can tell when she’s talking, as well as when she stops. She wants to swing it open the millisecond that happens, but she forces herself to have the smallest bit of restraint. It would frighten Rio, probably — her barging in like that. Plus, it would make her seem anxious about the prospect of her ex-wife and current…Rio having a conversation.</p><p>Which she is. Obviously. It sort of makes her want to throw up. Again.</p><p>But Agatha had admitted to far too much fear already today — so much so that her body seemed to be literally, physically rejecting that, too. Agatha could pound back round after round of shots like it was nothing, put every drug in the world into her body and be, more or less, fine. But the moment an emotion entered her system? The second she had to, even worse, <em>talk</em> about said feeling? Oh, it made her feel positively terminal.</p><p>So Agatha knocks, and Rio responds with a “Hm?” which she takes as an invitation to push the door open. </p><p>“Did she act like an uptight, holier-than-thou, morally superior twat?”</p><p>“No.” Rio shakes her head. “She was…” Ever the attorney, she searches for the perfect word. “Respectful.”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha blinks, flooded with surprise and relief and…something else she can’t quite name but that doesn’t feel very pleasant. Feels like a wound, either to her pride or her heart or both. “Well. Good, then.”</p><p>“Yeah. She was…kind, actually,” Rio adds. Agatha’s sure it’s meant to reassure her, but it feels like she’s pouring salt in.</p><p>“You don’t already like her better than me, do you?” she jokes, hoping the real, underlying insecurity to it is undetectable. Everyone tended to like Wanda better. She had all this natural power over people, and she didn’t even have to work at it. Didn’t even have to try. Barely even used it for anything worthwhile. It all came so easily to her in a way Agatha could never comprehend. It was fascinating and infuriating and intoxicating and fucking bullshit.</p><p>“I’m not comparing you two. I see no reason to do that.” And Agatha’s sure this is meant to reassure her, too, but it feels like she’s kneading the salt in further.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t want to settle for being on the same level as Wanda. She wants to be better. She wants to be the best. She wants to be… </p><p>She wants to be good. Good enough for Rio to choose her confidently and without hesitation. </p><p>But she doesn’t know how to voice any of that without sounding pathetic or bitter or both. Without making herself sick or accidentally starting another argument or forcing Rio into giving her more undeserved reassurance when she had made it pretty clear she was in no position to do any more of that today. </p><p>So she doesn’t, simply nodding and crossing her arms protectively over her chest. “Good, then,” she repeats.</p><p>Rio raises a brow, looking at her for a long, long moment. “I like you, Agatha,” she finally says. “I want <em>you</em> — in ways I don’t like or want her or anybody else.”</p><p>Agatha’s sure it’s meant to reassure her, and it does. But it’s also…disconcerting — the way Rio is able to read her.</p><p>Then again, Rio had used that power not to hurt her but to help her — to tell her what she needed to hear. That realization sort of makes Agatha want to cry, but that would probably be pathetic, too, and besides, she doesn’t think she has any tears left after today, so she doesn’t do that either. </p><p>Instead, she clears her throat and walks the rest of the way into the room. “You need to eat,” she says, handing her the takeout box of chicken parmesan. “There’s some ice cream in the freezer, too. If you want. That’s optional, but this isn’t — at least half of it.”</p><p>Rio takes the box without breaking her gaze, which is intent and lawyerly. “You can’t avoid what I’m saying. Avoidance builds resentment.”</p><p>“And you can’t avoid food,” she counters. “That brand of avoidance builds starvation.”</p><p>“You’re using nutrition as a deflection tactic.”</p><p>Agatha lowers herself next to her on the bed. Though part of her is tempted to snap back with a petty comment — she’s very, very good at going in this circle, at playing this game — she had to admit it was a…relatively fair assumption, even if it was an inaccurate one.</p><p>“For once, I’m honestly not, sweetheart,” she promises. “Or I’m not trying to, at least.” </p><p>“Then what are you trying to do?” Rio presses, skepticism still shining in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha sighs, reaching out to gently tuck a piece of Rio’s hair — a little wild from lying in bed all evening — behind her ear. “I’m trying to…process the fact you two talked and resist the urge to interrogate you about it. I don’t want to police you like he would,” she confesses.</p><p>This communication thing objectively fucking sucks, but at least it seems to be working, as the suspicion seems to disappear from Rio’s face, giving way to something softer.</p><p>It’s enough to encourage Agatha to continue. “I’m trying to trust that you would tell me anything I would need to know if it jeopardized my custody of Nicky.” Her thumb strokes Rio’s cheek. “And I’m trying to take care of you, even though it’s pretty obvious that’s not my strong suit,” she whispers. “But I’m not trying to deflect.”</p><p>Rio slowly nods, finally dropping her gaze. She opens the container and seems to contemplate, though whether she’s debating whether she can force herself to scarf any of it down or thinking about what to say back is unclear. “She wasn’t angry with you, if that helps,” Rio offers. “She was more concerned for me than anything.”</p><p>Wanda was very much mad at Agatha — Agatha knows this because Wanda had told her, “I’m so fucking mad at you,” approximately two dozen times in the hour they were on the phone — but she’s glad that she seemed to have at least heeded Agatha’s warnings to “calm her fucking tits” before she had passed the phone to Rio. </p><p>The fact that Wanda had expressed concern for Rio is extremely annoying. Part of Agatha is convinced that she did it just to spite her — to prove how nauseatingly <em>nice</em> and <em>selfless</em> and <em>mature</em> she is. But another part of her — a smaller part but one that shocks her quite a lot — feels almost tender. Almost…proud, even though it doesn’t really make sense. Yes, Rio was…hers. Sort of. And yes, she deserved every ounce of everyone’s compassion and adoration.</p><p>Rio looks up at her again. “I do appreciate that you’re making an effort,” she says softly. “To trust me. And to take care of me.”</p><p>She <em>does</em> deflect that, because she has zero clue how the hell to process something so sincere. “Maybe you could show me how much you appreciate it by taking a bite of that,” she says, gesturing back down to the container. <em>Or taking me to bed</em>, she narrowly avoids adding. Not because she doesn’t want that — she wants that very, very badly, especially after a day as long and emotionally loaded as this — but because she doesn’t want Rio to feel pressured. Doesn’t want her to pretend to want it too for Agatha’s sake. It was so strange how Rio’s desires had begun to eclipse her own more and more.</p><p>Rio sighs, but she does take a small bite. And another. And another, bigger and less reluctant each time. “It’s good,” she admits.</p><p>“For the waiter kid and kitchen staff’s sake, I’m glad to hear it.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t blame them if it wasn’t.”</p><p>“And I wouldn’t hesitate to stomp down there to demand a full refund and more free champagne.” Agatha shrugs, lighthearted but meaning it — a fact Rio is all too aware of.</p><p>She gives her a look. “Not everything has to go to that extreme. It’s just one meal.”</p><p>Agatha shoots her a look right back, more serious than this particular situation calls for, maybe, but it was symbolic of a much larger issue. “You deserve the best, Rio. And you should demand it — always.”</p><p>“But it’s okay to compromise or let things go sometimes. I’m not crying over bad chicken.”</p><p>Compromising and letting things go were not Agatha’s strong suits. Or even…regular suits. They were not skills Agatha possessed at all. Agatha would also not cry over bad chicken — she would yell over it. Threaten over it. Make a scene over it. </p><p>But to point out either of those distinctions would be to get trapped in that circle Agatha was actively trying to avoid for a change. And in order to keep avoiding the cycle, she needed to change the subject. Fast. </p><p>She looks down at the pasta, and her mind inexplicably goes to those infrequent childhood films — ones she barely even cared for, truthfully. She only liked them because she associated them with…not even pleasure, really. A reprieve from pain. </p><p>She plucks a spaghetti noodle from the container, letting it dangle from her smirking lips. “Come here.” She beckons Rio closer with her pointer, the motion hopefully silly and seductive at once. “Be the lady to my tramp.” Agatha wasn’t good at cutesy acts of affection, but she <em>was</em> very good at the strictly physical aspects of intimacy, and so perhaps it could balance out, and she could make this work. </p><p>Wishful thinking. It…does not work. At all. Rio does not seem endeared or turned on or anything but confused, her brows knitting. “What?”</p><p>“You don’t know—" She lets the noodle drop from her mouth. “<em>Lady and the Tramp</em>! Where the dogs share the spaghetti! Oh, <em>Rio</em>.” She shakes her head. “I know it was before your time.” She holds up her finger. “It was before mine, too, so we're clear. But come on now! It’s a classic!”</p><p>“I never saw it as a kid,” Rio admits, a hint of embarrassment creeping into her tone. It was almost sweet — that <em>she</em> was blushing when it was Agatha who had just humiliated herself with a failed gesture. “I would just obsessively fixate on one movie for months. I never got around to that one, apparently.”</p><p>Despite everything, she can’t help but breathe out an affectionate laugh at the thought of Rio sitting too close to the TV screen, wearing down her beloved VHS tapes. “Well, which ones did you watch? Early ‘90s, that was…what?”</p><p>“I mean, I loved <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, <em>Mulan</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>...”</p><p>“All right, then let me try putting this into terms that are less fitting but that you’ll understand,” she says, putting another noodle in her mouth. “Be the beauty to my beast—”</p><p>“You’re not a beast, Agatha,” Rio firmly cuts her off. “Or a tramp, for that matter.”</p><p>The comment jars her enough to make her drop the spaghetti again. She hadn’t expected Rio to read anything into that, though, of course, she probably should have. She was both very literal and highly attuned to Agatha’s subtle self-deprecation.</p><p>“It was just a joke, Rio,” Agatha reassures her with a half-lie. She may not have consciously meant it, but she is objectively both things. Has even <em>embraced</em> her status as a monster and a whore.</p><p>“Well, it wasn’t funny,” Rio says, mouth a thin line. “I don’t like hearing you talk about yourself like that. Don’t do it again.”</p><p>Agatha chews on the inside of her cheek. She’s not sure if it’s the slight rush of pleasant heat that flows through her every time Rio gets more authoritative or the fact that she doesn’t want to upset her even more than she already has today, but she finds herself nodding in agreement. “Okay. Understood.”</p><p>“Good.” Rio nods, too, relaxing. “Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha, probably stupidly, picks up another noodle. She feels like she has to see this through at this point — discover if the third time will finally be the charm. “Now, do you want to be the beauty to my…also beauty by sucking on the other side of this until we meet in the middle?”</p><p>“Suuure,” Rio says slowly, tilting her head to take the other end in her mouth and slurping until they lock lips.</p><p>Agatha enjoys the kiss very much. She does not, however, enjoy the way Rio is looking at her like she’s off her fucking rocker for the whole thing once she pulls away. </p><p>She purses her lips. “Okay, see, I <em>really</em> think you need to watch the movie to understand how adorable and romantic I was being just now,” she bluntly insists, frantically digging herself a deeper hole as she grabs the remote from the side table and logs into the streaming service she’s been mooching from some kid’s family Nicky had a playdate with once. “It does <em>not</em> happen often, and such a momentous occasion needs to be fully and thoroughly appreciated.”</p><p>“Can I shower first?”</p><p>Agatha considers cheekily saying no — telling her that getting her reference was far more important than cleanliness — but the look in Rio’s eyes stops her. It’s not, she realizes, a rhetorical question.</p><p>“You never have to ask permission to perform basic hygiene,” Agatha informs her as casually as she can manage. As if she doesn’t want to learn witchcraft for the sole purpose of resurrecting Thanos’ body just so <em>she</em> can kill him this time, much more slowly and painfully than the death Rio had gifted him. “Not with me.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio blinks away the flicker of puzzlement and mortification that crosses her face. “Right. Okay. I’ll be back in 10.”</p><p>“You can even make it 12 if you really want. I’ll start missing you too much after 15, though,” she says with a small smile, desperately still trying to lighten things after the hellish day they’ve both had. It’s still undeniably a coping mechanism for her own comfort — the joking — but she hopes perhaps this kind will put Rio at ease as well.</p><p>Rio splits the difference and is back in 11 minutes, hair damp and eyes heavy despite sleeping a good portion of the day away. She ends up falling asleep before the iconic spaghetti scene even happens, but Agatha can’t find it in her heart to wake her — not when she's cuddled up against her like she is, looking so peaceful.</p><p>Agatha can count on one hand the number of nights she’s fallen asleep to the sound of Rio’s soft snores, but she’s not sure how she ever managed to drift off without them. Not sure how she would ever manage it — or anything again, if she was being honest (Agatha did not especially like being honest) — without Rio by her side.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>While Agatha falls asleep to the feeling of Rio's breath against her face, she wakes up the next morning to the feeling of her lips pressed against her cheek and — after she stirs — the sound of a whispered, “Sorry.”</p><p>She cracks an eyelid open. “You should be,” she says, voice faintly gravelly in that freshly awake way. “I was having the most fabulous dream where I was being kissed awake by a hot little minx."</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Rio replies, her mouth curved into a small smirk, the faintest blush in her cheeks.</p><p>Agatha opens her other eye, taking her all in. Fuck, she’s beautiful — even first thing in the morning like this, with her hair a mess and flecks of crust in the corner of her eye. And fuck, she wants to feel her mouth again — feel it everywhere. She’s woken up with whatever the vaginal equivalent of morning wood is, no doubt partially fueled by the tiny moment of dominance Rio showed last night. She can’t stop thinking about it — <em>feeling</em> about it — wet and needy and horny as hell. It was uncomfortable, having an itch that only Rio could scratch. </p><p>She takes her bottom lip between her teeth, stopping herself from doing something stupid. Patient. Agatha had to be patient.</p><p>Rio, of course, is either oblivious or trying to torture her (probably the former — Rio was, as they’d established, much nicer and more eager to please than Agatha in many ways), as she snuggles closer and drapes a leg over her. “You’re comfortable.”</p><p>Agatha bites down harder, eyes fluttering closed once more. “And you’re gonna be the death of me,” she softly counters, voice huskier still.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Yup, confirmed oblivious.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head and opens her eyes. “Nothing.”</p><p>The space between Rio’s brow creases in concern. “You sure?”</p><p>“Yes.” She feels a little bad lying to her. And that’s bizarre — Agatha has never had a problem lying to anyone about anything ever. “No,” she tries, though the truth feels sort of bad, too. Makes her feel a little guilty. And that’s just as strange. </p><p>Agatha covers her face with her hands. “Fuck.” Her voice is still a little groggy, and she decides to blame her uncharacteristic awkwardness on the fact that she’d just woken up and not the fact that she was emotionally inept. “I don’t— I don’t know.”</p><p>“Okaaay,” Rio slowly replies.</p><p>She blows out a breath, uncovering her face. She’s sure her pupils are noticeably blown just by a kiss on the cheek and having Rio pressed up against her fully clothed, which was honestly pretty pathetic. She was craving release — a particular kind of release from a particular person — but, of course, it wasn’t that simple. </p><p>“I want you,” she whispers, face flushing at the vaguely humiliating confession. “So badly. But I don’t…want to rush you. Or hurt you.” Another deep breath, desire and nerves alike pooling in her core as she licks her lips. “I want it to be on your terms. I want you to take exactly what you want from me, do exactly what you want to me.” <em>For both our sakes. For both our enjoyment.</em></p><p>Rio purses her lips, silent for a long moment as she considers. “No sex,” she finally decides. “Not now.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha thinks she does a pretty good job of not sounding disappointed.</p><p>“But…other things,” Rio proposes. “I’d be happy to do other things.”</p><p>“Yes.” She nods vehemently. She knows she does a pretty terrible job of not sounding elated. “Please. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p>“You’ll be okay to stop when I need to?”</p><p>“Whatever you want to take,” Agatha repeats. “Whatever you want to do. No more, no less.” She puts her hand under Rio’s chin — which is a little counterintuitive, maybe, considering she’s volunteering for a more submissive role at the moment. But this transcended that. This was important. This was something she needed Rio to hear and really believe. “You. Are in. Control. Okay?"</p><p>Rio bites the inside of her cheek, hesitating for another beat. “Just promise you’ll be okay if I stop things at any point. I need to hear that before I can continue.”</p><p>“I pinky swear, blood oath, cross my heart and hope to die that I’ll be okay.”</p><p>Rio nods, taking a deep breath before going for it. She practically lunges at Agatha, lips crashing into hers. Agatha immediately lets out a small moan into her mouth.</p><p>It’s clear Rio’s not used to it — the rush of power. Clear she’s fighting the urge to pull back, not because she’s not enjoying it, but because she’s enjoying it too much. Pleasure — real pleasure — seems to scare her, evident by the fact she broke down in Agatha’s bed, Agatha’s bathtub, Agatha’s arms the first time they’d had sex.</p><p>“You can pull on it,” Agatha breathes out as Rio breaks away and runs a hand through her hair. “If you want.” </p><p>Agatha wants. She wants Rio hard, and she wants Rio soft. She wants Rio rough, and she wants Rio gentle. She wants Rio every way that Rio will allow.</p><p>Rio gives it a light, uncertain tug before going back to something more familiar, threading her fingers through it once more. It’s sweet, Agatha thinks, the way Rio is scared she’s going to hurt her. And a little sad, too — the way Rio is obviously scared Agatha is going to hurt her in return.</p><p>She gives Rio a small smile as her hand cards through her curls, turning her cheek into her touch. “I’m not going to make fun of you,” she softly vows, uncharacteristically earnest. “I know you’re afraid you'll look stupid — you told me as much at dinner that second night — but I won’t think that. I could never think that. I want you to...feel safe. To…try things.”</p><p>Rio blinks, a dozen emotions seeming to cycle through her face — exposed and touched and embarrassed and encouraged. After a moment, she nods, grabbing onto Agatha’s hair more harshly and pulling her into another deep kiss.</p><p>Agatha lets out a whine of pleasure. It’s not so much that she’s playing it up to validate Rio as she is not forcing herself to hold back like she normally does. As she is allowing herself to let loose on this side of things. It’s as much an experiment for her.</p><p>“You’re doing so well,” Agatha praises in the little moments Rio comes up for air. “I like this so much. Maybe you could tell me where to put my hands.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t verbally respond, but she manages to find them without breaking the kiss, guiding them to rest on her waist. Agatha gives it a small squeeze of approval.</p><p>She’s been wearing a tank top to bed — Sicily was so damn hot, and the air conditioning was so damn lacking — a fact she appreciates now as Rio’s hand trails up to rest on the bare skin of her bicep. Her touch is warm, but it sends a shiver through her anyway.</p><p>After a moment, Rio sits back enough to look at her. She absentmindedly drums her fingers against Agatha’s shoulder, dotted with more freckles than usual from the sun. “Sit up,” she finally says.</p><p>Agatha scoots up against the headboard, though probably less than Rio’s requesting — very lightly pushing to test how she’ll react.</p><p>“More,” Rio half demands, half whines.</p><p>She’s tempted to go full brat — Agatha was very, very good at going full brat, and she very, very much enjoyed it — but she realizes Rio probably isn’t ready for that. Even the most experienced people weren’t. So instead, she complies, the corner of her mouth curving into a small smirk. Whether it’s in delight at the command or the hint of desperation or some combination of both, she’s not entirely sure.</p><p>The smirk doesn’t last long, though — not when Rio straddles her, taking her face in her hands and shoving her tongue into her mouth. Agatha’s lips eagerly part, her head naturally tilting back and lightly knocking against the headboard as the kiss deepens.</p><p>Rio must feel safe right now, if she was doing this.</p><p>Agatha feels safe, too — so safe it almost wraps around to being scary again. Agatha Harkness — the most selfish, independent person in the world — would do anything Rio asked her to right now.</p><p>But Rio doesn’t ask anything of her. Rio continues grinding on her lap and making out with her like they’re in high school. Except this…it doesn’t feel childish at all. It’s deeply intimate somehow, and deeply vulnerable, too. Agatha had never associated those two things with pleasure — with anything but pure terror and disgust — but she can’t pretend she isn’t thoroughly enjoying this. The liberation that comes with letting go and trusting that someone will catch her. There are chemicals flooding her brain that have never so much as floated there before.</p><p>After…who the hell knows how long — two minutes? Ten? Thirty? Time seemed unimportant and perhaps even nonexistent — Rio sits back on her heels, taking a finger and lightly tracing it over Agatha’s chest, her arm, her stomach.</p><p>She’s a little embarrassed at the goosebumps that immediately prick up on her skin, and she hopes Rio will mistake the slight blush in her cheeks for a sunburn. Was she really this touch-starved? Or was it just that she had never been touched like this? Never <em>allowed</em> anyone to touch her like this? </p><p>Or perhaps it was she, her very body, that was different. Perhaps yesterday — perhaps this entire vacation, from the moment she'd laid eyes on Rio — she had been shedding a layer, exposing something rawer and infinitely more sensitive underneath.</p><p>Rio leans forward again, placing a couple of gentle kisses on her jaw. “You’re so beautiful.”</p><p>She swallows hard and prays Rio also won’t be able to feel the way her pulse is racing as her mouth gets dangerously close to her neck. She knows she’s pretty, of course, but it sure felt nice to hear. Especially from the lips that had been driving her wild all morning.</p><p>“Thank you,” she manages to whisper.</p><p>“Seriously, Agatha. You’re gorgeous.”</p><p>Another swallow. Another whispered, desperate, “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio shifts to kiss her hard for another long moment and nips at her bottom lip — the delicious, stingy surprise of it eliciting a tiny whimper from Agatha — before she dismounts from her lap, flopping down beside her.</p><p>Agatha’s panting like she’s just run a marathon — sweating like she has, too. “Fuck, sweetheart,” she mutters. “Fuck.” She’s blissed out but also insatiable as always, hungry and needy in a way that’s almost primal. She digs her nails into her thighs, missing the weight and warmth of Rio on top of them. “Could I— I mean— Would you mind if I—" she stutters out, frazzled.</p><p>Rio rolls over to face her, brows wrinkling with an earnest innocence. She had no idea the power she possessed. No fucking idea. How fascinating and tragic. “What?” </p><p>She takes a deep breath. “Touch myself,” she says, it sounding like a confession as she continues to claw her leg with one hand — the other reaching up to cover her red face.</p><p>She can hear Rio take a sharp inhale before exhaling out an, “Oh.”</p><p>“I know you don’t want to have sex — and that is absolutely fine — but you…you got me all worked up. And you can say no if it’s crossing a line or even too close to it. You can say no, and I won’t be mad at all.” She peeks out between her fingers. “But if it might make you feel good — just to give permission, just to watch, just to see the effect you have on me…”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen a bit, though it seems to be more out of awe than discomfort. She chews on her lip for a second. “Go ahead,” she allows. “But I think watching might be one step too far for me today.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha breathes out, relief flooding through her at the fact that Rio wasn’t going to inadvertently edge her. “That’s okay.” A beat. “Do you want me to…go to the bathroom, or—”</p><p>“You can do it here,” Rio responds rather quickly. “I don’t mind.”</p><p>“You sure?”</p><p>“Positive.” Rio nods, the corner of her mouth curving into a reassuring and faintly mischievous smile. “Do <em>not</em> get out of this bed until you orgasm. Understand?”</p><p>Oh, <em>fuck</em>. Her voice is light and teasing, but still. <em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says. “God, yes.” She takes one hand from her thigh to pull the sheet up higher — it seemed the courteous thing to do — while the other wastes no time dipping under the waistband of her shorts, fingering her already slick folds.</p><p>Though Rio had said she didn’t mind, Agatha still tries to be relatively quiet out of respect. The added challenge is a bit of a thrill, in all honesty, increasing the enjoyment that much more. It doesn’t take long to come in her state, with one risked glance over at Rio sitting beside her — the woman’s eyes closed as she leans back against the headboard — pushing her over the edge.</p><p>Agatha squeezes her eyes shut again in order to ride out the wave that crests over her, keeps them that way as she starts coming down from it all, though a wince jars her enough to snap them open again. She looks over to see Rio feeling around her throat, still inflamed and bruised.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha says, pulling her hand from her underwear, though she has the sense to reach over with her clean one to pull Rio’s arm down. “Don’t do that — you’ll agitate it.”</p><p>Rio frowns, reluctantly letting Agatha guide her hand away from the injury. “It hurts.”</p><p>“And you think pressing on it is going to make it hurt <em>less</em>?” Agatha quips, exasperated, though she rubs soothing circles on the tender skin below the underside of the wrist she’s still holding.</p><p>“It’s not that.” Rio grimaces. “I just…”</p><p>“Just what?” she presses.</p><p>“The pain makes me feel…real,” she admits. “Otherwise, I’m…disconnected.”</p><p>“So you…want it to hurt.” Agatha squints, trying to process this. “Because you’re trying to be…present?” Her voice gets quieter, a realization making her heart twinge. “With me?”</p><p>“Yes. And it’s so fucking hard. I feel like I’m not here.”</p><p>“But you <em>are</em> here.” Agatha places a light kiss to the soft skin of her arm now. “And I’m here.” Another kiss. “And I’m not…I’m not going anywhere.” Another as she tries not to think about how terrifying the promise she just made is.</p><p>“I know that. My brain does, at least. But the rest of me, my body…</p><p>Agatha contemplates for a moment. “I could give you a massage,” she suggests. “I briefly worked at a spa after I got fired from the hair salon. It wouldn’t hurt per se, but it would be…pressure. Would that help? Or me touching you like that…is that a no-go?”</p><p>Rio bites the inside of her cheek. “Could— Could you do my shoulders?” she meekly requests.</p><p>Agatha spreads her legs and pats the space on the mattress between them, suddenly realizing her sticky fingers might be an issue. “One of my hands is a little…”</p><p>Rio waves her off. “I don’t care. Just lick it off or something.”</p><p>The command threatens to make her wet again — this was a rapid turn of events, and Agatha hadn’t exactly had time to get back to baseline after all of…that. But she valiantly tries to shove any dirty thought she may have to the far side of her brain, taking her fingers in her mouth and cleaning off her own climax as clinically as possible as Rio settles in front of her.</p><p>“Any particular spot you want me to work?” she asks.</p><p>Rio shrugs. “Everything sort of aches today.”</p><p>She puts her hands on her shoulders, beginning to gently knead. “By that logic, shouldn’t you feel more grounded, then? Not less?”</p><p>“It’s not really like that. The pain doesn’t tether me so much as it makes me aware that I’m being pulled under.”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha hums, nodding even though she doesn’t completely understand. Her pain was gasoline on a fire, whereas Rio’s seemed to be a weight in the ocean. Which reminds her… “Do you still want to try swimming with the sharks today? I can’t imagine that’d make you feel anything less than alive.”</p><p>“We can call the doctor, but I don’t know if I can with my calf.”</p><p>“I know. That’s why I said ‘try.’” She increases the pressure a little, trying to alleviate some of the evident tension in her muscles. “You’ll also remember I said ‘do you still <em>want</em> to’ — a question you never answered. Is that something you would <em>like</em> to do today if given a green light?”</p><p>Rio sucks in a deep breath and blows it out slowly. “In theory, yes. A very big part of me does. But the other is still so…exhausted. Bone-deep — that’s how Wanda described it.”</p><p>Agatha tries to forget the mention of Ginger-Oh-Wait-Sorry-Blonde-Now-Actually Bitch. “It is our last full day here,” she reminds her, a gentle nudge. “So if there was ever a time to carpe diem…”</p><p>“But what if I hurt myself more? Or get a flesh-eating bacterial infection?”</p><p>“As I said, we’ll double-check with the doctor. I’ve made it pretty clear I’m not going to allow you to hurt yourself more, have I not?” She leans forward, biting Rio’s shoulder as lightly as possible — like how she used to pretend to eat Nicky’s fingers when he was a baby. “Plus, I’m the only one allowed to eat your flesh,” she purrs. “I’ll tell those bacteria that I’m the jealous type and that I don’t fucking share.”</p><p>When Rio snorts out something resembling a laugh, Agatha goes back to rubbing her shoulders. “We’ll waterproof the shit out of your leg, okay? It will be borderline comically bandaged. And if you’re afraid of sticking out, we can even wrap my leg to match — I don’t give a fuck about drawing attention. Nicky either. He’d probably love it, actually. The kid could never be swaddled tightly enough. It was a little freaky, actually.”</p><p>“If you say so,” Rio replies, only half listening and a quarter convinced. She takes another breath. “I…I want to try to find a gift shop, too. He never let me— And I was just thinking maybe I could— It could—”</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha encourages, brushing over her thinly veiled internal crisis. “Whatever you want.” She wasn’t necessarily into buying cheap-ass souvenirs, but it was no skin off her back to either shoplift a few or put them on Sharon Davis’ credit card.</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “I know it’s stupid.”</p><p>“‘Stupid’ is joining ‘sorry’ on the list of s-words I don’t want to hear you say anymore.”</p><p>She turns her head to face her. “But it does <em>feel</em> like that,” she explains. “And I don’t want you to think poorly of me.”</p><p>“Please. If anything, I’m flattered you want a tacky little memento of the place we met.”</p><p>Rio’s obviously not sold, but she gives her a nod anyway before her gaze drops to her lap.</p><p>Agatha can tell, of course — immediately. “Hey.” She takes one hand off Rio’s shoulder, turning her chin around enough to face her again. “Don’t do that. Don’t just cave to appease me. I can go back-and-forth with you all day, baby — I’m relentless that way. Convincing, too. Give me a chance to actually persuade you for real.”</p><p>She groans, rubbing a hand over her face. “It’s fine.”</p><p>“It’s not fine with me,” she seriously insists. “It sort of…makes me feel like shit, honestly.”</p><p>Rio drops her hand then, brows crinkling. “Why?”</p><p>“Because it tells me you don’t trust me not to hurt you the way he did.” She lets go of Rio’s chin, the eye contact now too vulnerable for her. She stares at Rio’s back, beginning to massage her shoulders again. “And I know — I know — it’s a…fawning…trauma…response,” she says. The therapy speak she’d read about during her crash course internet spiral about domestic abuse tastes new and strange and <em>wrong</em> on her tongue, but she presses on. “But it makes me feel like I’m…I don’t know…bullying you into compliance. Which I obviously have no problem doing to most people most of the time, but I’m actively trying not to do that with you. I’m trying to openly and honestly communicate, even though I find it deeply annoying and unpleasant. So I need you to do the same.”</p><p>Rio’s hand drifts up to rub at her bruised neck again. “I’m sorry. That’s not my intention. I just…I don’t want you to think I’m dumb or tacky or immature.”</p><p>She resists the urge to chew her out for yet another unnecessary apology. “I don’t tolerate idiots, much less let them in my bed,” she reminds her, gently but firmly moving Rio’s hand away again. She holds it as she rests her chin on her shoulder. “I think you’re brilliant, Rio. And sophisticated. And frankly, if anything, I think you’re a little too mature sometimes — to fully appreciate my crass but hilarious jokes.”</p><p>“But how?” Rio whispers. “How do you not think I’m weak and stupid?”</p><p>“Because you know how to handle me,” she says bluntly. “Weak, stupid people can’t keep up or <em>put</em> up with me — that’s god’s honest truth. I either destroy them, or they leave. But you’re still here. You. Are still. Here,” she reiterates, pressing her lips to her shoulder.</p><p>Rio takes a shuddery breath. “I feel out of my depth,” she admits, voice cracking the smallest bit. “Not because of you,” she quickly clarifies. “At all. You’re the only thing in my life that feels okay right now. But everything else is like…is like waves knocking me down over and over again.”</p><p>There’s something touching and deeply scary about that — about being the only okay thing in someone’s life. “I’m not gonna let you drown.”</p><p>“I’m clinging on with everything I have.” </p><p>There’s something even more terrifying about that. But there’s some relief in it, too — in the promise that she wasn’t going to let this sea take her. Wasn’t going to fill her pockets with rocks to help it along.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha says. “Good.” </p>

<p>The doctors give Rio the go-ahead for the shark outing with the caveat that she is to be carefully bandaged before submerging her leg and extremely cautious during the whole activity. Which, no shit. Agatha makes sure to thank them with more than a little sarcasm for their brilliant expertise.</p><p>She plans to call and reserve a slot a little after lunch while Rio gets ready, but she finds herself phoning someone else first. </p><p>“Lilia,” she greets once she hears the woman pick up.</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t my least favorite criminal,” Lilia replies.</p><p>“Aww, you’re gonna make me blush. I’d say you’re my least favorite centenarian, but I think you’re the only one I know — not many people are lucky enough to live into their hundreds,” she shoots back. She smirks as she hears the undeniable sound of clinking plates and scraping forks in the background. “How was your dinner date with your ‘dashing gentlewoman’? Are you still on it? Have you been at the restaurant with her <em>all night</em>? Oh, <em>Lilia</em> — you absolute <em>trollop</em>.”</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>She’s half-tempted to press about the mysterious shuffleboard woman, but she doesn’t want Lilia to get the impression she actually cares. (Because she doesn’t. Obviously.) </p><p>Just like she obviously doesn’t actually care about Lilia’s approval when she tells her, “I talked to Nicky last night. About Mommy Dearest. Like I said I would. Just so you know.”</p><p>“Oh?” Lilia says, surprise evident even in the single syllable. “Good for you.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, vaguely offended. “You thought I wouldn’t do it.”</p><p>“Yes,” she bluntly responds. “You’re a notorious coward in the emotions department.”</p><p>“Well, I talked to Rio, too,” she adds. She sounds petulant, which she hates, but she’s telling Lilia how wrong she is, which she loves. “Last night and this morning. About my stupid feelings. So put that in your pipe and smoke it."</p><p>“I don't feel ashamed for voicing my opinion of you,” Lilia retorts, tone almost bored. “Especially when it’s right on the money.”</p><p>“Um, <em>no</em>? I’m proving how <em>incorrect</em> your perception of me is with a plethora of extremely compelling evidence. Exhibits A, B, and fucking C. Rio would back me — and she’s a lawyer.”</p><p>“You sound like a child,” Lilia dryly points out.</p><p>“Everyone sounds like a child when you’re ancient,” she snaps back in a rather lame retort. It was difficult to truly rile Lilia up — to engage in a satisfying argument with her — a fact that got under Agatha’s skin in a uniquely irritating way.</p><p>“I assume you didn’t call me just to tell me you spoke to your son.”</p><p>She…sort of did, though that felt like too complicated a thing to explain.</p><p>Or maybe it wasn’t. Maybe it was just your run-of-the-mill raging mommy issues. A subconscious craving to demonstrate to herself that yes, actually, she <em>was</em> capable of not being a total fucking disappointment and yes, actually, she <em>could</em> make someone like that proud.</p><p>Maybe it was actually extremely fucking simple to explain, but it was definitely far too mortifying a thing to admit to, so Agatha does what she does best and lies. “Nicky wants to see how you fare in shark-infested waters.”</p><p>“No, thank you,” Lilia politely and firmly declines.</p><p>“It's not optional."</p><p>“I’ll babysit or go to an aquarium all day, but I will not be getting in the water with sharks.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “You’re being a baby. My six-year-old is doing it. So is Rio, and she has a bruised neck and a fucked-up leg.”</p><p>“All right,” Lilia replies, unfazed. “If that’s all, I have a spa appointment to get to.”</p><p>“You’re really going to break my little boy’s heart?” she asks, laying the guilt on as thick as she can.</p><p>“For a deep tissue massage?” Lilia deadpans. “Yes. I’ll see you later.”</p><p>“Lilia,” she says, forcing her name out through gritted teeth before she can hang up. God, she was really going to make her say it, wasn’t she? “Please.” <em>Ew</em>. “I…would also…like you to come.” <em>Disgusting</em>.</p><p>There’s a long beat of silence. “Oh?” Lilia repeats, voice somehow even more shocked than before.</p><p>“Are you calling me a liar?” she snaps. Then, before she can answer, “Don’t answer that. Yes. Okay? <em>Yes</em>.” She needs a buffer. And a babysitter. She wasn't confident she could properly handle both Rio and Nicky's needs on her own, and it’s not like she had a plethora of suitable options.</p><p>There’s a slightly shorter pause as she considers. “I’ll come along,” she finally agrees. “But I’m not getting in the water.”</p><p>“Afraid you’ll melt?” Agatha quips. “Wicked Witch style?”</p><p>“Goodbye, Agatha.”</p><p>The call with the shark swimming people takes a little longer than expected. She has to…persuade them to shuffle some other appointments around to accommodate a chronically ill little boy and a woman who had just suffered a horrific accident before they left the next day.</p><p>The bathroom door opens at the same time the bedroom one does, Rio and Nicky both stepping into the room. Agatha throws up her hands. “I’m being flanked! I’m being ambushed! You’ll never take me alive!”</p><p>Nicky giggles, running in and jumping into her arms. Agatha catches him, dramatically falling back onto the bed.</p><p>Rio smiles, though Agatha can sense an undercurrent of apprehension as she glances over at her. “Rio, you want to tell Nicky what we’re doing today?”</p><p>She blinks, snapping out of that dissociative daze she often seemed to fall into. “What?”</p><p>“What are we doing today, Ms. Rio?” Nicky helps.</p><p>“Oh.” She shakes her head a little as if trying to clear it. “Swimming with sharks.”</p><p>Nicky gasps and sits up straight, his face lighting up as he looks at his mother to confirm.</p><p>Agatha nods, a small smile playing on her own face. His enthusiasm was contagious. “It was Ms. Rio’s idea.”</p><p>He leaps off the bed, going to tackle her in a hug now.</p><p>Rio lets out a little ‘oof’ as Nicky barrels into her, tensing for a millisecond before wrapping her arms around him. “You’re excited, then?”</p><p>“Really, really, <em>really</em> excited." He bounces on the balls of his feet. "I love, love, <em>love</em> sharks.”</p><p>“And we are all so, so, so glad,” Agatha playfully ribs.</p><p>The corner of Rio’s mouth curves into a tiny smile. “I happen to love sharks, too.”</p><p>“Because you’re like me!” Nicky proclaims, stepping back from her embrace to look up at her. “Are we going right now?”</p><p>“Food first,” Agatha informs him. “And I have to wrap Ms. Rio’s leg.”</p><p>“Can you wrap mine, too?” Nicky asks.</p><p>Agatha gives Rio a look like, ‘See? Told you so.’ “Sure. You can be my guinea pig.”</p><p>“I want to be a rabbit instead.”</p><p>“All right.” Agatha nods. “My test bunny. Hopefully, PETA hasn’t bugged this room, or we’re in a world of trouble.”</p><p>“I’ll go clean mine off while you do that,” Rio says, nodding toward the bathroom.</p><p>“I’ll help,” Agatha offers as she sits up on the bed, voice casual but leaving no real room to turn her down. </p><p>“And I’ll hold your hand,” Nicky volunteers. “So it’ll hurt less.”</p><p>Rio forces her mouth into another smile, though this one doesn’t quite reach her eyes. “That’s sweet of you both, but I’ll be okay.”</p><p>Nicky frowns. “Do you want to hold my bunny? Like you did at the hospital?"</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “I’m all right. Promise.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flit between them a few times. “Nicky, why don’t you go get dressed, brush your teeth, call your—“ Ugh, she hates that she was suggesting this. Again. “—mom while I help Ms. Rio.” </p><p>“I already did my teeth,” Nicky insists, eyes drifting to the left. </p><p>Agatha narrows her own in response, reaching forward and grabbing his chin. “Breathe,” she orders. </p><p>He sucks in an inhale through his nose. </p><p>“<em>Out</em>,” she sternly clarifies. “Through your mouth.” </p><p>He reluctantly does so, and Agatha sniffs before wrinkling her nose and letting go of his face. “Liar. Brush.”</p><p>“But the toothpaste is yucky,” he whines. </p><p>“Trust me, your breath is yuckier. <em>Go</em>.” </p><p>Nicky’s shoulders slump, but he sulkily heads to his bathroom.</p><p>Rio raises her brows, shooting Agatha a questioning look. Agatha’s lift to match. “What?” she asks. “I’m not allowed to want to do some PG-rated doctor-patient roleplay with you?”</p><p>Rio drops her gaze to her shuffling feet. “It’s not that,” she quietly admits. “I’m just…still worried about it all.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. The teasing was, once again, not working, so the bluntly honest truth would have to do. “Yes, I know. And <em>I’m</em> worried about <em>you</em>. I don’t trust you not to give your calf the same treatment as your neck, and it'd be a shame to have to amputate such a beautiful leg."</p><p>“I'm trying, Agatha. I really am."</p><p>“I <em>know</em> you’re trying. <em>I’m</em> trying, too — to help you. Aren’t <em>you</em> the one who’s always telling me there’s no shame in accepting it?” She wishes it felt more cathartic, throwing Rio’s own words back in her face, but mostly, she just feels mortifyingly incompetent. She must be doing something wrong for Rio to reject her assistance.</p><p>“It’s not that I don’t want to,” Rio swears, risking a glance up at her. “There’s just this…nagging feeling that I don’t deserve your help, and it’s making me push back. But I don’t mean to push <em>you</em>.”</p><p>There’s a beat as Agatha searches Rio’s face, finding nothing but sincerity there. So much sincerity, in fact, that it gets to be too much for <em>her</em> now. She looks down at her hands, picking at a hangnail. “I get that,” she quietly confesses. “I mean, obviously, you know firsthand just how much I get that.”</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath. “What if we compromise?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flick back up. “Go on…”</p><p>“I’ll wrap my own leg, but you can sit in there with me and make sure it all goes okay.”</p><p>Agatha slowly nods, the pieces falling into place. “You don’t want to be touched,” she says. A statement — not a question. “Do you.”</p><p>Rio purses her lips. “Not right now.”</p><p>That awful, gnawing feeling — the one that told Agatha she was a failure — intensifies tenfold. “Then you can <em>tell</em> me that, Rio,” she vows, undercurrents of desperation and exasperation both simmering under her words. “I need you to know that you can just <em>tell</em> me that, point-blank. I know that I’m pushy and bossy and horny, but I’m never going to do that unless you want me to — whether that means fingering you to your fifth orgasm in a row or just holding your fucking hand."</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispers, biting her lip now. “I’m sorry. I’m just…conditioned to people being upset when I say what I want.”</p><p>“I know.” She pinches the bridge of her nose. “But I need <em>you</em> to know that I’m not going to do that. And I really, <em>really</em> need you to stop apologizing for this shit — because <em>that</em> actually <em>does</em> upset me.” She looks at her sternly. “Do not respond to that with another apology.”</p><p>Rio sucks in an inhale but miraculously resists the urge to ask forgiveness once more. “Logically, I think I do. But every time I try to advocate for myself, my stomach drops about 10 feet to my ass.”</p><p>She squints, scanning her up and down. “Your stomach to your ass is only, like, a foot and a half. You're short."</p><p>The comment earns her an eye roll. “It’s called hyperbole. I’m attempting to make a point.”</p><p>“I’m aware. <em>I’m</em> attempting to lighten the mood.” Agatha reaches out to take Rio’s hands instinctively, abruptly dropping them back to her sides. “Sorry. No touching.”</p><p>“Hand is okay,” Rio permits. “Just nothing else.”</p><p>She nods and reaches up again, gently clasping one in her own. “What if you compromise with me now?”</p><p>The space between Rio’s brow creases. “How do you mean?”</p><p>“What’s the stupidest, silliest, most outrageous word you can think of?”</p><p>The line on her forehead deepens. “I’m not sure…”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “It’s not a test, Rio. There’s no wrong answer. Just tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. I, for instance, might say ‘flaccid.’"</p><p>“Um…” Rio blinks a few times. “Squamous,” she settles on.</p><p>“I don’t know what the hell that means.”</p><p>“It’s a biology term that has to do with—”</p><p>Agatha waves her off. “Doesn’t matter. It’s perfect. Every time you want to say ‘sorry,’ you’re going to say ‘squamous’ instead.”</p><p>The crease between her brows grows deeper still. “Why?”</p><p>“Because I know you can’t quit serial apologizing cold turkey, but you can replace it with something else. Think of it as a verbal nicotine patch.” Agatha didn't believe in those and wouldn’t give up her beloved cigarettes even if she did, but that was beside the point. “Still scratches enough of that itch while weaning yourself off the habit. The fact that the word is humorous to you should make it feel less serious — lower stakes.”</p><p>The look on Rio’s face is vaguely <em>Lady and the Tramp</em> situation-esque, which is really not Agatha’s favorite, but at least she verbally replies with lukewarm agreement in the form of, “I’ll…try, I suppose.”</p><p>“If you mess up, you have to say one nice thing about yourself,” she adds. A beat. “And one nice thing about me, just because.”</p><p>Rio cringes at the mere thought. “I don’t know about that.”</p><p>“Okay, fine — forget the part about me. You can just affirm yourself.”</p><p>“Let’s just start with the word thing, okay?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. "You need to recognize something you like about yourself if you forget to do that, though. I guess saying something you hate about him instead could also work…but there needs to be some kind of productive association to help change the behavior.” </p><p>Rio gives her a skeptical look. “I thought you didn’t believe in therapy.”</p><p>She holds up her palms. “Oh, god — I <em>don’t</em>,” she defends. “But I <em>have</em> been forced to go to a few shrinks in my day. And while I think most of what they say is a crock of shit, I do know the power of both vanity and spite.”</p><p>Rio’s suspicious expression morphs into something more vulnerable and pleading. “I can’t change everything overnight.”</p><p>Agatha huffs out a breath. “Have I not made it clear that I don’t expect you to?” She seemed to be hitting a wall. And while she was doing her damnedest to fucking scale it — to not just knock it over like she normally would — it doesn’t particularly feel like Rio’s eager to throw her any rope to help her up the stupid thing.</p><p>Because she doesn’t trust her? Probably, that was at least somewhat true, even if it was unconscious on Rio’s part. And probably, she was smart not to, as loath as Agatha was to admit it.</p><p>Had she given Wanda rope on the phone last night? Was she already higher on the wall than her despite only beginning the climb hours ago?</p><p>The thought makes her feel inadequate and demoralized enough to continue explaining — to try to salvage a conversation it feels like she’s somehow already tanked despite her greatest efforts. “I’m trying to give you small, actionable steps.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio recognizes. “But these are patterns that I’ve spent years of my life adhering to.”</p><p>“Right. Yes.” She’s trying so hard not to let any of the frustration — aimed mostly at herself, of course, though Rio almost surely wouldn’t read it that way — seep through. “And I’m trying to help you break them.”</p><p>“All the little behavior changes in the world won’t truly fix anything until I actually heal.”</p><p>“But the two things go <em>together</em> and are meant to <em>help</em> you heal by—" <em>Shut up, Agatha</em>, a voice in her head stops her — one that sounds dangerously similar to the one she’d heard during her breakdown in the aquarium. <em>Just shut the fuck up and walk away from the wall. What the hell do you know about healing anyway? About helping? About anything like this? You’re only embarrassing yourself here. You’re only making it worse. Like you always do. </em>“Okay,” she relents. “Okay, fine. Let’s just…wrap your leg.”</p><p>“I <em>do</em> appreciate what you’re doing.”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips, nods her head — any encouragement falling on deaf ears as Rio’s voice is drowned out by the one in her brain. “Okay.”</p><p>“And I appreciate how much you care.”</p><p>“Good.” </p><p>“I think it’s just…too much pressure right now. I need to take things slower.”</p><p>“I get it,” she mumbles. And just like last night, she’s positive that Rio is trying to help her, but it hurts in a way she despises. Agatha was always too fast, too aggressive, too <em>much</em> — and somehow, it all added up to never being enough. </p><p>She desperately needs a distraction — an action to help her pretend that wasn't the case — and takes Rio's hand again, tugging her toward the bathroom. “Leg.”</p>

<p>The leg wrapping is a fine (albeit quiet) affair, with Agatha still far more in her head than she’d like to be. Her head is not a particularly fun place to live most of the time, which is why she preferred to be in her body — preferred to smoke, to drink, to touch and be touched.</p><p>She supervises Rio’s very necessary bandage application before doing Nicky’s frivolous one, too — an activity he enjoys as much as opening birthday gifts and getting extra dessert after dinner. Little weirdo.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t have time to do her own, seeing as their shark swimming appointment is soon approaching and she needs to feed Nicky (and Rio, as much as she might resist it) before they go.</p><p>It must be peak brunch hour, as the buffet is packed — so packed, in fact, that she spots Eros sharing a table with Jen and Alice near the front, presumably unable to find a free place to sit. (Jen does not look thrilled by this.)</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t The Three Musketeers,” Agatha greets as she approaches.</p><p>"What?” Jen scowls.</p><p>"Three Stooges?" Agatha pitches instead. "Three Amigos? Alice and the Chipmunks?"</p><p>"At least she remembered my name this time," Alice mutters under her breath.</p><p>“We're not a <em>trio</em>," Jen spits. "I literally don't even <em>know</em> this man.”</p><p>Eros stands. “Rio,” he says, voice somehow both frantic and relieved.</p><p>“Hi,” she replies, weariness already evident in the single syllable. “What do you need?”</p><p>“You never texted me last night — about what you wanted me to tell my mom.” He looks at Agatha. “You said you’d make sure she remembered."</p><p>“Oh. Yeah.” Agatha grimaces over-dramatically, performatively sucking in some air through her teeth. “I guess, um…” She rubs the back of her neck. “I guess maybe I lied.”</p><p>Jen gives Eros a look. “Rookie move. I could’ve told you she was gonna do that.” </p><p>Eros furrows his brows. “I thought you said you barely knew her.”</p><p>“I did,” Jen deadpans. “And I <em>still</em> could’ve told you she was gonna do that.”</p><p>Rio sighs, running a hand over her face. “Shut up, Jen.”</p><p>Jen puts up her palms. “<em>You</em> people dragged <em>me</em> into this — I was trying to eat my kale salad in peace.”</p><p>“Kale salad.” Agatha snorts. “My god, that is so ridiculously on the nose.”</p><p>Rio promptly ignores them both. “Eros, you’re a grown man. Why couldn’t you handle that?”</p><p>He throws his hands up. “Because <em>she</em>—" He gestures at Agatha. “—told me to wait until <em>you</em> told me what you wanted me to say, remember?”</p><p>Nicky tugs on Agatha’s hand. “Mama, what’s he talking about?”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips, looking down at him before glancing up at the table once more. “Do you mind watching him for a sec?”</p><p>“Um, <em>yes</em>?” Jen replies, looking at her like she’s fucking insane. “Yes, I very much <em>mind</em>. I thought we agreed we weren’t even going to speak again on this trip. Or ever again, for that matter.”</p><p>Agatha looks at Alice now — the bigger pushover of the two. “Just for a quick, adults-only sidebar.” She pinches one of Nicky’s cheeks. “How could you say no to this precious little face?”</p><p>Before Alice can respond, Rio steps in. “Okay, I don’t have the patience for this again, so here’s what’s going to happen. Agatha, you’re going to find a place to sit with Nicky. Eros, we’re going to talk over there.” She gestures to the back corner of the dining room. “Jen and Alice…” She refocuses her attention on the table. “Well, I don’t actually care what you do.”</p><p>“Why am I even part of this?” Jen mumbles. “How do I <em>always</em> somehow become part of this?”</p><p>Agatha reaches out to put a hand on Rio’s back before dropping it abruptly. She doesn’t want to be touched. She doesn’t want….Agatha? At all? Maybe?</p><p>It’s a horrible thought. And leaving Rio alone with Eros — however cordial he seemed — felt like a horrible idea, what with his inevitable communication to the WASPy Witch of the West.</p><p>Fuck, this was bad. Bad enough that she suddenly very much wishes they had already met up with Lilia so she could help.</p><p>Fuck, if <em>that</em> thought was crossing her mind, this was really, <em>really</em> bad.</p><p>Agatha leans in close to Rio’s ear. “I’m sorry — I’ll behave,” she whispers, hoping that her voice is communicating sincerity without too much pathetic desperation and panic creeping in. “I’ll set Nicky up with his iPad and a pair of those big-ass headphones. Just…please let me come with you.”</p><p>“I’ll be okay. He’s not his brother.”</p><p><em>The bar is in the ninth circle of hell</em>, she thinks. “Please,” she says. “I’ll do what my mother always wanted for me and be seen and not heard — not speak unless spoken to — but let me be there for you.”</p><p>Rio blinks, turning her head to look at her. “I’m not mad at you,” she assures her. “You know that, right? I’m just trying to problem-solve.”</p><p>It’s Agatha’s turn to blink. No. No, she didn’t know that, actually. But she doesn’t really want to admit to that, so she avoids the question entirely, focusing only on the second part of what she’d said.</p><p>“I’m trying to do the same,” she promises. “At least let me supervise again, like I did with your leg.”</p><p>Rio bites her lip, contemplating. “Nicky can’t overhear any of this.”</p><p>“Of course not. They’re noise-cancelling — he won’t be able to hear shit.”</p><p>“You’re 100% sure?”</p><p>“Let’s just say I used to borrow them to wear around Ginger Bitch to piss her off, and it worked like a charm. At least, I think. I’m no expert lip reader, but it certainly <em>looked</em> like she was yelling curse words at me.” She can’t help but smirk a little at the memory, even despite the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>Rio switches to chewing on the inside of her cheek. “Turn him facing away from us, too. He’s very astute, and I don’t want him to pick anything up from our facial expressions.”</p><p>It’s highly unnecessary, Rio’s concern about Nicky in this situation, considering Agatha’s protectiveness toward him would have guaranteed all of these precautions anyway. And if anyone else were acting like this, she’d likely be defensive — pissed, even. Nicky was <em>her</em> child, after all, and she was more than capable of taking care of him.</p><p>But for some reason, Rio’s fretting makes Agatha soften instead of prickle. Touches something tender inside.</p><p>“I will strategically angle him,” she pledges.</p><p>“And you’ll keep an eye on him while we talk to make sure he stays there?” Rio checks. “I don’t want him wandering away again. He was so scared when I found him on the beach that day.”</p><p>“That was a fluke.” Agatha quirks a brow. “You’re well-acquainted with the fact that I’m a phenomenal multitasker, are you not?”</p><p>A small blush creeps into her cheeks, no doubt thinking of when she simultaneously used her tongue and fingers to do some truly mind-blowing things the other day. “Y— yes.”</p><p>“Can we—“ Eros speaks up. </p><p>Agatha whips to face him. “The grown-ups are talking,” she snaps. “Patience is a virtue, or so I’ve heard.”</p><p>Nicky taps Agatha’s leg, impatiently shuffling. “Mama, I’m hungry.”</p><p>Agatha runs a gentle hand through his hair as she looks down at him, demeanor doing a 180 at his interruption. “I know, angel. We’re going.” She glances back up at Rio with a little nod — her silent oath that it’d be okay.</p><p>Rio nods, too, taking a deep breath. “Eros, let Agatha set Nicky up with some food, and then we’ll talk.”</p><p>“Come on,” Agatha says, jerking her head toward the back of the restaurant, slyly snatching something as she ushers them there. “We’ll sit in that corner.”</p><p>“There’s nothing free back there,” Eros says. “Trust me — I’ve checked.”</p><p>“And trust <em>me</em> — there will be.” </p><p>Agatha locates the four-top with the most privacy and the easiest looking targets in the form of a Midwestern family. “‘Scuse me,” she says as she approaches, sneakily setting the object she’d lifted onto the table before tapping it a few times. “This table’s booked.”</p><p>The father looks up at her. “This one?"</p><p>"This very one."</p><p>"Are you sure?”</p><p>Agatha gestures toward the <em>RESERVED</em> sign she definitely hadn’t just planted here. "Yes, my <em>teeny tiny </em>little<em> lady brain</em> is <em>positive</em>."</p><p>“Oh, Harold — she’s right,” his wife says, patting his arm with a blush. “We’re so sorry.”</p><p>Agatha gives her a tight smile that communicates that she doesn’t quite forgive them.</p><p>“This is such bullshit,” the son grumbles as he picks up his half-empty plate, the daughter shooting a glare at Agatha as she does the same.</p><p>Agatha subtly flips them off as they retreat before locating the waiter kid a few tables away. “Hey!” she calls.</p><p>He looks over at her before frantically ducking his head and turning away.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “I know you saw me.” She snaps her fingers before pointing to the dirty table. “This needs bussed. Chop, chop.” She drops her bag on the chair before leading the group over to the buffet. </p><p>Agatha makes good on her promise to multitask even in line, simultaneously scooping some eggs and potatoes onto her own plate, making sure that Nicky didn’t get too much pure sugar, and checking that Rio got enough of anything at all.</p><p>The waiter kid is still wiping the table off when Agatha returns, and she takes a quick, menacing step toward him — pretending she’s about to lunge. She has no plans to actually do so, but it is fun to watch him flinch.</p><p>“That’ll do.” She drops her tray on the table. “Scram.” He very eagerly complies.</p><p>Agatha reaches into her bag, rummaging around Nicky’s PEP mask, Goldfish crumbs, and a few loose cigarettes to pull out the iPad. “You want to watch some <em>Dora</em>?”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes grow wide. “At a restaurant?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>His voice grows quiet and vaguely scandalized. “But Mom doesn’t even like it when I eat in front of the TV at home.”</p><p>“Well, she’s not here, and I’m not gonna tell her.” Agatha takes the initiative to put the headphones — adorably a little too big for him — over his ears. “Happy last day of vacation.”</p><p>“What?!” he yells.</p><p>Agatha looks at Rio. “They work,” she confirms.</p><p>“Good. Now make sure he’s completely turned away.”</p><p>“You’re just stalling at this point,” she accuses in a mumble, though she dutifully bumps the iPad with her elbow while reaching for her coffee, angling it away from the other chairs.</p><p>Nick looks up at her, puzzled.</p><p>“Sorry, buddy — accident,” she explains.</p><p>“Huh?!” he loudly asks, the idea of taking the headphones off not even crossing his mind. Thank god even the smartest kids could be a little dumb sometimes.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head as if to say, ‘Nothing,’ and points back at the screen. Nicky takes a forkful of waffle as he does so, syrup dripping down his chin and onto his shirt. Whatever.</p><p>“All right,” Agatha says, snatching a piece of bacon off of Eros’ plate.</p><p>“Hey. What the—"</p><p>“Start figuring this shit out. We have sharks to swim with."</p><p>Eros sighs, pressing the heel of his hands into his bloodshot eyes. “Rio, I just need you to tell me what information you want me to relay to my mother. Your—" He wisely decides not to try to label whatever the hell she and Agatha were. “—she—” He settles on instead, nodding toward her. “—said to wait so you could control the narrative with her, and I agree, but she’s been bombarding me nonstop.” His phone buzzes, lighting up with the word <em>MOTHER</em> on the table. “See? It’s been happening all night. Between that and the jet lag, I’ve gotten no sleep.”</p><p>There are about a dozen snarky comments sitting on the tip of Agatha’s tongue, but she bites it before any of them can tumble out of her mouth. She’d made a promise to be an observer in this conversation — one that was already proving fucking torturous.</p><p>“Okay, then let’s go over our options,” Rio reasons. “There’s the truth — that her son is a monster I had to protect myself from — which she won’t like.”</p><p>“Or believe,” Eros mumbles.</p><p>“And then there’s a lie that you couldn’t find me. That I’d already left the island.”</p><p>“Which is risky. She might spot you in the background of someone’s photo on the resort’s location tag.”</p><p>“You think she’s combing through that?” Eros gives Rio a look, and she scowls. “Right,” she mutters. “Of course she is. I wouldn't put anything past her.”</p><p>“It might also make it seem like you have something to hide.” </p><p>Rio glowers at him. “Which I <em>don’t</em>.”</p><p>“I know. I know.” Eros holds his hands up. “You’re in an impossible situation.”</p><p>“Story of my fucking life,” she grumbles, stirring some yogurt around her bowl. “What does she want to hear, huh? What’s going to make her happy?”</p><p>“That it was all a tragic mistake?” Eros proposes. “That her son’s still alive?”</p><p>“Clearly, that's not happening.”</p><p>“As far as consolation prizes go…for me to tell her that you’re a crazed lunatic who’s clearly lying?”</p><p>She shoots him another glare. “Well, you aren’t doing that either.”</p><p>“No.” He holds up his palms. “No, obviously I’m not going to do that.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, an idea forming in her brain. “But maybe you could tell her <em>you’re</em> a crazed lunatic.”</p><p>Eros’ gaze snaps over to her. “What?”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips as she looks at Rio, the slightest bit guilty at already breaking her promise to be a silent chaperone about two minutes in. “Permission to speak freely?”</p><p>Rio raises a cautious eyebrow. “Motion granted…”</p><p>Agatha nods and turns to Eros. “You tell your mother that you found Rio and gave her a piece of your mind. Really laid into her — I’m talking verbal annihilation, maximum intimidation.”</p><p>Eros’ eyes widen, horrified. “But I don’t…I don’t want to do that.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her own in response. “You wouldn’t actually <em>have</em> to,” she snaps, rather impressed she managed to hold back a far more derogatory comment. “You just <em>say</em> you did. She’d feel smug that her master plan worked — that she managed to get to Rio through you — which might even make her slow down on the online crusade for a beat. And she’d be pleased with you for doing her bidding. Might even let you spearhead some of the threatening, when really, you’d be a double-agent working for us. Plus, wouldn’t it feel good to finally find out what Mommy’s approval feels like?”</p><p>Eros squirms in his seat, looking down at the table. “I guess,” he admits.</p><p>“The story that she coerced you into bullying an abuse survivor might even help Rio’s situation if there’s any justice in the world,” Agatha points out. “Which there isn’t, but you know — ‘hope’ and ‘optimism’ and whatever the fuck.”</p><p>She and Eros both peer over at Rio. “What do you think?” Eros asks.</p><p>Rio’s tongue pokes the inside of her cheek as she considers. “It’s probably an okay plan.”</p><p>“It’s a brilliant plan,” Agatha mumbles, a little insulted at the mere ‘okay’ label.</p><p>“<em>If</em>—” Rio looks at Eros. “—you can pull it off. You’d have to commit. Fully. 120%.”</p><p>Eros swallows hard. “What do you mean? What— What, exactly, would I have to do?"</p><p>“Construct the ‘rant’ you yelled at me in your head — she might ask for details. And speak with conviction. She’s a nasty bitch, so obviously, don’t egg her on, but you can’t shrivel away.”</p><p>“You should practice,” Agatha suggests. “Rio, you’re a lawyer — interrogate him about the fake screaming match.”</p><p>Rio raises a brow at him. “Do you need that?”</p><p>“I mean...I don’t— I don’t kn—“</p><p>“He needs it,” Agatha dryly answers on his behalf.</p><p>Rio rubs her temples and lets out a long sigh. “Just get it together, okay?”</p><p>He lifts his palms. “I will. I will. I promise.”</p><p>“You know what happens if you break that promise?” Agatha threatens.</p><p>He winces. “<em>You</em> break <em>me</em>?” </p><p>“Precisely.”</p><p>“She’s probably not kidding,” Rio warns.</p><p>“Oh, I’m not,” Agatha confirms.</p><p>“I know.” He grimaces. “I know that.” He blows out a breath, giving Rio a look — sympathetic and serious. “I can do this.”</p><p>“You swear?”</p><p>“Yes,” he vows. “You can trust me.”</p><p>Rio softens a little. “I believe you,” she assures him. “But do <em>you</em> believe in your ability to do this?”</p><p>He nods. “I’m going to figure it out. It’s the least I could do.”</p><p>“Correct,” Agatha agrees. “Very good job at recognizing your bare minimum contribution.”</p><p>“And you won’t fold under pressure, right?” Rio checks. “If she asks for specifics?”</p><p>“I won’t let you down.” He places a gentle hand over hers. “I’ll rehearse everything I’m going to say — every potential question she might ask — a hundred times. I’ll even run it through ChatGPT to check if there are any holes in my story,” he says earnestly.</p><p>“ChatGP—“ Agatha puts her hands over her face. “Oh fuck, we’re doomed. We’re fucking <em>doomed</em>.”</p><p>A few people turn to give her odd looks.</p><p>“What?” she snaps at them, putting her hands up. “We are! Wake up and look at the state of the world right now!”</p><p>“No AI,” Rio firmly insists. “Call me if you have to.”</p><p>He lifts his palms again. “Okay, okay. You…call me if you have to, too. If you need anything. I know I’m probably fucking up, but…I really am trying. I really do care.”</p><p>Rio gives him a soft, bittersweet smile. “I know."</p><p>“Good.” He nods.</p><p>There's a beat of not altogether uncomfortable silence as Agatha looks down at her phone to check the time. “We should get going. The sharks aren’t going to swim with themselves.”</p><p>Eros’ brows wrinkle. “I’m…pretty sure they—"</p><p>Agatha cuts him off by stealing the last piece of bacon off his plate, popping it in her mouth before scooting her chair out. “Ta-ta for now.” </p><p>Rio’s plate is still fuller than Agatha would like, but to her credit, she does grab a slice of pineapple to take to-go.</p><p>Agatha rewards this by carding a hand through her hair. “Good girl,” she praises with a purr, taking advantage of the fact that Nicky still couldn’t hear them — and that Eros most certainly could.</p><p>His face turns red. “I’m gonna—“ He gets up too fast, losing his balance and slamming his hip on the table. “—<em>ow</em>. Go now.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes as he leaves, though she does melt back into Agatha’s touch. “You didn’t have to torture him.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, continuing to stroke her locks. “That was light hazing at most.”</p><p>“Which still isn’t great.”</p><p>She pouts. “I thought I showed remarkable restraint.”</p><p>“You did,” Rio admits, tilting her chin back to peer up at her. “But honey gets you far more flies than vinegar.”</p><p>“Good thing I don’t like flies, then,” Agatha quips, grabbing a piece of waffle off Nicky’s plate and giving him a nudge. “You ready to go?”</p><p>He looks up at her from the iPad. “What?!” he yells.</p><p>Agatha lifts one of the headphones off his ear. “I said, ‘Are you ready to go?’”</p><p>“Oh!” He perks up. “Yes!”</p><p>Agatha lets the headphone fall back into position. “Wonderful.”</p><p>“Huh?!”</p><p>Agatha rubs a hand over her face, already mapping out how she could steal a mimosa on the way out of the restaurant.</p><hr/><p>Agatha when Nicky interrupts her vs. Agatha when Eros interrupts her.</p><p><img alt="" height="446" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G6GRF9wX0AAtS7e?format=png&amp;name=900x900" width="807"/></p>

<p>“Ms. Lilia!” Nicky greets as he spies the woman waiting outside the shark swimming headquarters, looking a bit silly as he runs over to her with his heavily and unnecessarily bandaged leg.</p><p>Lilia is unfazed. “Hello, young man. How are you this morning?”</p><p>“Happy!” He throws his arms around her. “We’re gonna swim with sharkies!”</p><p>“Well, Ms. Lilia isn’t,” Agatha tells him as she and Rio approach more slowly.</p><p>“You’re not?” Nicky’s mouth drops into a frown, tilting his head back to peer up at her. “How come?”</p><p>“Because she’s chickenshit,” Agatha mutters under her breath.</p><p>“Because I have old, brittle bones,” Lilia explains, shooting Agatha a disapproving look. “I’ll still come out on the boat with you, all right?”</p><p>"Okay," he replies, satisfied enough by the compromise. He looks back at Agatha in concern as they make their way into the building. “Are your bones too old and brittle, too, Mama?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, offended. “I’m half her age, Nicky. My bones are youthful and exceptionally strong.” It was true enough. She’d only broken her arm once as a child, though with the way Evanora handled her, it probably should have been a lot more. She leaves this part out. The conversation about the scars the previous night had been plenty.</p><p>The stupid waiter kid is working the check-in desk, because of course he is. He grimaces as he spies Agatha.</p><p>“Do you have a twin or something?” Agatha asks him.</p><p>He blinks in surprise at the question. “Y— yes, actually,” he tells her. “But we’re fraternal. And Tommy doesn’t work here.”</p><p>“So you just work everywhere, then.”</p><p>“Kind of? I’m a floater. I go where they need me.”</p><p>Agatha taps the desk impatiently. “Well, <em>I</em> need you to check us in. Four for the boat ride, three for the actual excursion.” </p><p>He purses his lips and types on the computer, wincing as he pulls up their booking. “Yeah. Um. So. About that…” </p><p>“About what?” Agatha snaps. “I called and made a reservation. They said it was handled.”</p><p>“It is!” he reassures her. “But, uh…there were only two slots available.”</p><p>Agatha’s nostrils flare. “Why didn’t they tell me this on the phone?”</p><p>“The notes said they tried? But that you hung up before they could get it all out.” </p><p>Oh. Right. Probably true.</p><p>Agatha sighs, running a hand over her face before turning to Rio. “Will you be okay to go with him?”</p><p>Rio freezes, a hint of panic flickering in her eyes. “I mean, I suppose, but I don’t have to if that’s a problem.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous — it’s <em>your</em> dream.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio quickly assures her. “I don’t want to overstep or do something wrong. I'm—” She abruptly cuts herself off. “Squamous,” she mumbles.</p><p>Agatha blinks in confusion before her brain catches up, the corner of her mouth quirking into a small, approving smile. She leans forward to place a light, encouraging kiss on her jaw before whispering in her ear, “Flaccid, baby. Flaccid. As long as you make sure he doesn’t drown or get eaten, I promise I'll drown in your cunt later and let you eat mine whenever you want.”</p><p>Agatha can practically feel the sudden heat radiating off Rio’s blushing cheeks. “Just hold me for a second?” she quietly asks.</p><p>She wordlessly wraps her arms around her. “You’re allowed to say no to me touching you,” Agatha reminds her. “But I’m never going to say no to the privilege."</p><p>Rio sinks into her embrace, her muscles relaxing at the contact. “It’ll be okay?”</p><p>“You supervising Nicky in the shark water? Yes, without a doubt. Me being trapped with the old kook on the boat for an hour? To be determined.”</p><p>Rio nods. “Tighter?” she requests.</p><p>“Only if you do the same,” Agatha negotiates, though she obliges. “‘I’m clinging on with everything I have,’ remember?”</p><p>“I’m trying,” Rio promises, fingertips pressing harder into Agatha’s back in compliance. “I really am.”</p><p>“I’m about to give that phrase the ’squamous’ treatment,” she playfully threatens, holding onto her for another moment before giving her a squeeze and pulling away with an embarrassing amount of reluctance. “You don’t have to keep saying that, okay? Just keep doing it." She reaches up, cupping Rio's still lightly flushed face. "Now go cross some shit off your bucket list." </p><p>The boat ride out into the ocean is uneventful, save for the fact that the safety precautions the instructors drone on and on about are entirely too long. ‘Don’t antagonize the sharks.’ Fucking duh. (Never mind the fact that Agatha probably would if she were allowed in the water. Besides the point.)</p><p>No, Agatha was stuck next to a different kind of shark in the form of Lilia as Nicky and Rio tread water below.</p><p>“You know, the sharks would probably relish biting you,” the older woman dryly muses, a cigarette in hand.</p><p>“Projecting, Lilia?” Agatha retorts. “Is this your way of saying you’re desperate for a taste of me?”</p><p>Lilia wrinkles her nose in disgust that looks insultingly sincere. “Absolutely not. I just meant that your pervasive antagonistic energy would be enough to make them mad on principle.”</p><p>“Give me more credit — my pervasive antagonistic energy would be enough to make the most pure and patient of saints mad, too.”</p><p>Lilia gives her a look. “That’s <em>not</em> a badge of honor.”</p><p>“To you, maybe.”</p><p>“To 99% of the world, dear.”</p><p>“Guess I’m part of the 1%. A special little snowflake.”</p><p>Lilia shakes her head, taking another drag. “Whatever helps you sleep at night.”</p><p>“I sleep just fine,” Agatha proclaims, more defensiveness than she planned creeping into her voice. It’s half true, she justifies to herself, crossing her arms over her chest. She sleeps amazingly when she’s holding Rio. When she’s <em>thinking</em> about Rio, on the other hand — when all of the doubt, the worry that she won’t be able to hold <em>onto</em> Rio seeps in — that’s when she tosses and turns.</p><p>“Sure,” Lilia skeptically replies, blowing out a long trail of smoke.</p><p>“I do,” she snaps, plucking the cigarette from her hand. “You can’t do that on here. Didn’t you hear the safety guides?” she asks before taking a puff. She makes a face. “Ugh, I forgot you smoked Kols.”</p><p>“They’re not paying a damn bit of attention to us,” Lilia notes. She either doesn’t want to fight Agatha for it back, doesn’t want to share saliva with her, or some combination of the two, as she fishes a fresh one out from the container in her purse.</p><p>“Well, luckily, it sounds like you already got plenty of attention from your shuffleboard woman last night, hm?” Agatha side-eyes her.</p><p>Lilia shrugs, nonchalant as they come. Super irritating. Agatha was really hoping to make her squirm at least a little. “Sure.”</p><p>“Oh, come on.” She rolls her eyes. “You’re really gonna hold out on me?”</p><p>She shrugs again. “I don’t know why you’re so interested in my sex life.”</p><p>“Well, you either tell me about your sweet, sweet lovin’, or I stare out at the sea with my thoughts for the next—“ She looks down at her watch. “—52 minutes.”</p><p>“Okay,” Lilia replies, clearly choosing the latter option.</p><p>“Does she not actually exist?” Agatha presses. Anything not to be alone with the anxieties that had been stewing since that morning. That were rising to the surface as Rio and Nicky went under it. “Is that why you won’t give me the deets? Is it a ‘my girlfriend goes to another school’ situation? Because that would be pathetic — and I would mercilessly make fun of you — but after, I might also give you some tips on how to land a not-imaginary woman if you groveled a little and asked very, very ni—”</p><p>“Can you just shut the fuck up?” Lilia cuts her off with a glare. “You’re the only one interested in what you have to say.”</p><p>That stings more than it should — a fact she’s sure shows on her face the millisecond before she manages to school it back into her nonchalant mask.</p><p>Normally, she wouldn’t give a shit. Normally, it’d egg her on even more. Normally, it’d make her feel big and powerful instead of very, very small in every sense of that word.</p><p>But nothing about this vacation had been remotely normal.</p><p>Lilia wasn’t Rio or Nicky — Lilia wasn’t even close — but she wasn’t…nobody, either. Not anymore. For some mysterious, infuriating reason.</p><p>Plus, it compounded every fear she’d felt with Rio. She had been trying to bond, in her own weird, fucked up way. Had been trying to show interest in Lilia’s life under the guise of the snippy banter that the foundation their short, strangely intense relationship had been built upon.</p><p>“Geez, I was just trying to make conversation,” she mumbles.</p><p>Lilia raises her chin, straightens her posture against the bench. “Well, a conversation about my sex life is not one I want to have.”</p><p>“Got it. You made that crystal fucking clear,” she responds, taking another puff of the stolen cigarette as she looks out at the ocean. The big, stupid ocean keeping her from storming away from stupid Lilia and her own stupid feelings. “So sorry for disrupting your prudish peace.”</p><p>“We can talk about something. Just not that.”</p><p>“It’s fine. I don’t need your charity.”</p><p>Lilia looks over at her. “What’s got you so puffed up?”</p><p>“That’s not a conversation I want to have,” she snarks back, though using Lilia’s own words against her feels...hollow, somehow. Doesn’t give her the satisfaction she’d hoped.</p><p>“All right.” Lilia nods, proceeding to pull out her phone.</p><p>Agatha clenches her jaw, unable to decide if she’s more upset or relieved that Lilia hadn’t pushed for once. After a few agonizing moments of silence, she glances down at Lilia’s screen, raising a brow as she sees her playing Tetris. “Took you more for an online poker person.”</p><p>“There’s no internet out here.”</p><p>She rolls her eyes. “A poker app that doesn’t require service, then.”</p><p>“Eh, not as fun.”</p><p>“And that is?” Agatha presses, trying to drag the conversation out by any means necessary. “Stacking things into neat little rows — that’s your definition of a good time?”</p><p>“Mm.” Lilia shrugs a shoulder, eyes staying glued to the phone.</p><p>Agatha runs her tongue over her teeth. “Well, it’s not mine. Patiently building things up? That shit’s not fun for me.”</p><p>“I’m shocked,” Lilia deadpans. </p><p>Agatha briefly glances over at Rio and Nicky in the water before her gaze drops to the bottom of the boat. “That shit’s not <em>possible</em> for me,” she mutters.</p><p>Lilia pauses her game in order to look up at her. “I disagree," she says, tone growing more sincere. “You just have to put the work in.”</p><p>“I’ve <em>been</em> putting the work in — I’ve been clocking triple fucking overtime,” she barks, though there’s a small croak of hurt in the midst of the frustration. “I’m still coming up short. I’m still doing it wrong. I’m still…" She struggles to even get the word out. "Failing.”</p><p>“It’s not a quick thing,” Lilia reasons. “You have to mess up a couple of times to get it right. It’s part of the whole process. And mistakes are just that — mistakes.”</p><p>“I can’t afford to make them. Not with her. The stakes…” Agatha shakes her head. “They’re way too high.”</p><p>“Well, you’re going to have to, or it’ll all culminate in something that’s not ideal.”</p><p>“Things are already not <em>ideal</em>, Lilia,” she snaps, looking over at her with a glare. “They’re already so <em>far</em> from ideal. She apologizes for every single thing, and she’s too afraid to let me touch her, and she opens up more to my fucking ex she met on the phone last night than she does me, and the worst part — the worst fucking part — is I can’t even really blame her for any of it,” she rambles, voice cracking. “Fuck.” She frantically swipes at a tear that’s fallen down her cheek. “Mother<em>fucking</em> fuck.”</p><p>Lilia sighs, softening a little. “She’s traumatized, Agatha. It’s just the way her nervous system is wired right now. Did she ever actually <em>say</em> she was afraid of you?”</p><p>“She doesn’t have to <em>say</em> it — I can see it in her eyes. In her body language when she flinches away from me. The fact is, I’m doing what you told me to do in your hotel room. I'm giving her my best and then some, and it’s <em>still</em> not good enough. She can <em>still</em> do better.”</p><p>“She flinches because she’s used to being hit,” Lilia rationalizes. “It’s not personal.”</p><p>“I’m used to being hit, too,” she bluntly retorts. “It’s always at least a <em>little</em> bit personal.”</p><p>“To you, maybe. Don’t project that onto Rio.”</p><p>“I know you don’t like me, you know,” Agatha accuses, swiping another stupid tear away. The timing of it is a total coincidence, of course, and not because a little part of her wishes Lilia did. “I know you see me as an annoying little gnat that doesn’t matter — that can’t affect you. So how do I know <em>you’re</em> not projecting <em>that</em> onto Rio when you claim there’s no way her reaction could have anything to do with me, huh?”</p><p>“I don’t dislike you,” she argues. A beat. “I don’t necessarily…like you either,” she confesses, “but I don’t dislike you, Agatha. My saying that you should read things as neutral until you have explicit confirmation that it’s not isn’t projecting. She and I both know you don’t want to hurt her.”</p><p>“Don’t you <em>get</em> it? She’d never give me explicit confirmation because <em>she</em> doesn’t want to hurt <em>me</em> for some mysterious fucking reason!”</p><p>“You’re not hearing me,” Lilia says, voice aggravatingly calm. “If you’re that concerned, have an adult conversation with her.”</p><p>“No, <em>you</em> aren’t hearing <em>me</em>,” she hisses. “We <em>have</em> conversed. We’ve conversed about this topic to death. She may say I’m what she wants — she might even believe it right now — but <em>I</em> know.” Agatha puts a hand to her chest, face contorting in pain. “I <em>know</em> who I am in here,” she continues in a whisper. “I’m not capable of loving her the way she needs, and I’m not—“ Her breath hitches. “—I’m not deserving of the love she has to give. That’s not a projection — it’s just a fucking fact.”</p><p>Lilia shakes her head. “That’s simply not true. She <em>chose</em> you, Agatha.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, she chose him, too, once upon a time." She sniffles, swiping the snot with her sleeve. "And she’s told me she gets stuck in patterns easily. Maybe she jumped out of the frying pan with him and straight into the fire with me.”</p><p>“I think you’re a lot of things, but an abuser is not one of them.”</p><p>“Like what?” she challenges. “Name the things, Lilia. I’d love to hear them.”</p><p>“A human, albeit a prideful one,” she lists. “A stubborn broad. A person with a weird simultaneous superiority and inferiority complex.”</p><p>“Great. That’s covered. What else you got, hm?” Agatha curves her fingers, motioning for her to bring it on. “Don’t hold back. It’s our last day here.”</p><p>Lilia sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Why are you like this?”</p><p>“Because I’d rather you just call me an evil bitch, or a trashy whore, or a terrible mother and get it over with already,” she spits, though there’s an undercurrent of wounded defeat. </p><p>She shifts her gaze away, clenching her jaw as she stares straight ahead. “It’s what you think. It’s what <em>everybody</em> thinks. And don’t lecture me about projection again — if I were to list everyone who’s said those things about me, we’d be here all day.”</p><p>She doesn't care. Not really. Not usually. She's trained herself not to care — to use the words as gasoline on the fire within her. But that doesn't stop her from getting burned on occasion.</p><p>“I don’t think you’re those things,” Lilia says, her voice achingly sincere and something close to soothing. “I think you’re doing everything you can to hide a world of hurt. I think you’re trying your best to be good for her.”</p><p>Agatha's quiet for a long, long moment, not daring to look over at the woman. “You really think I can?” she asks, voice taking on that vulnerable and vaguely childlike quality again. Something about that phrase…it shook those walls she’d built up so high. “You think I can be good?”</p><p>“I know you can.”</p><p>The simple affirmation — the mere belief — hits Agatha hard, touching somewhere deep and crumbling a layer of brick or two.</p><p>She clears her throat, attempting to rid it of the emotion that rises up. “I don’t know where the fuck you call home back in the States, but Nicky is going to want you to visit.” <em>I do, too</em>. “You’re old as shit, so he’s obviously latched onto you as a pathetic excuse for a grandmother figure.” <em>You’re not pathetic, and I’ve gotten attached as well</em>. “I hope you have airline points saved up or, at the very least, a car that gets decent gas mileage. If you don’t, I guess I’ll have to deal with your incompetence and figure it out myself, as per usual.” <em>Steal, commit fraud, engage in various illegal activities</em>. “For his sake.” <em>And mine</em>. “Okay?” <em>Please, Lilia. Please</em>.</p><p>Lilia quirks a brow. “Where do you all live?”</p><p>“Jersey. Snobby little suburb called Westview.”</p><p>She nods. “I’m up in Brooklyn.”</p><p>An hour and a half away. What are the odds? What are the fucking odds?</p><p>“Hm,” Agatha hums as nonchalantly as she can. “Not too far. That’s lucky for you.”</p><p>She hopes the way she reaches into her bag, pulls out a cigarette, and wordlessly hands it to Lilia to pay her back for the one she stole communicates the fact that she feels a little lucky, too.</p>

<p>Nicky talks Agatha’s ear off about the shark swimming, proclaiming, no fewer than a dozen times, that “he and Ms. Rio looked so silly in the big goggles” and that “one of the sharks winked at him” and that this is “the best day of his life.”</p><p>It gives Agatha a chip on her shoulder — one that will surely grow even bigger when he inevitably relays these declarations on the phone to Wanda. The best day of his life, and Agatha was the sole mom responsible. </p><p>Lilia offers to babysit Nicky so she and Rio can have one last romantic evening together — admittedly very thoughtful, even if it is likely mostly for Rio’s sake, as she had flat-out admitted she didn’t particularly like Agatha. (Though the way she gives her a little smile and wink makes her suspicious that she might be growing on her the smallest bit.)</p><p>Which is how Agatha finds herself across from Rio at the resort restaurant — the same table they’d first had dinner at a few days ago, ironically enough, though things had changed dramatically and irrevocably since then. </p><p>“So,” Agatha says as she picks up her menu. “I’ve heard Nicky’s recollection of events — approximately one thousand times — but how was it for you? Did you have as much fun diving into the shark-infested ocean as you did dipping into the lady pond with me?” She quirks a brow, the corner of her mouth rising to match in a little smirk.</p><p>Rio either doesn’t pick up on the innuendo or chooses to ignore it. Both would be equally on brand for her. “It was really great, actually,” she says, and Agatha can tell she means it. She seems to be breathing a little easier — her whole demeanor lighter. Freer. “I know it’s probably odd, but I thought they were cute.”</p><p>“Definitely odd,” she agrees, “but not all that surprising coming from you, considering you think I’m cute, too.”</p><p>“You are.” Rio shrugs. “We mostly saw blues and great whites, though we also got a glimpse of a couple of blacktip reefs. The guide said that was special — apparently, they’re pretty rare for the area.”</p><p>“Blacktip…” Agatha purses her lips. “I’m tempted to make a dick joke right now, but you’re being so wholesome, it’d feel wrong.”</p><p>She makes a face. “Please don’t. It’s an animal.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Just because I have a dirty mind doesn’t mean I’m into bestiality. Jesus, Rio.”</p><p>“You’re the one threatening to make sex jokes about it.”</p><p>“If anything, I’m making a joke about the perv of a scientist who named the poor thing.”</p><p>“It’s not pervy — it’s descriptive,” Rio defends. “Their dorsal fins have a black tip.”</p><p>“You’re such a nerd.” Agatha rolls her eyes affectionately before looking at her menu again. “Think I might eat like a shark tonight and order the fish. What about you?”</p><p>“I’m…not sure. Pesto chicken sounds okay, I guess.”</p><p>“We’re not settling for 'okay' on your last night at a luxury fucking resort. What sounds amazing? I don’t care if it’s not on the menu — the chef can figure it out.”</p><p>Rio stares down at her options for another long moment, chewing on the inside of her cheek. “I’m not sure,” she repeats, though the pitch of her voice heightens ever so slightly, and her gaze drifts to the left.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes again. “Unlike me, you’re not a very good liar.”</p><p>“I’m not lying,” she mumbles.</p><p>“You are,” she presses. “Tell me what you want, without thinking about price or calories.”</p><p>Another long beat passes. “Lobster,” she finally mumbles.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t even blink. “With which two sides?”</p><p>“I don’t need sides.”</p><p>“Yes, you do — you’ve basically been working out all day. Double working out, between the swimming and wrangling a feral six-year-old. Plus, they’re included with the entrée. So, I’ll ask again: with which two sides?”</p><p>A few more seconds of silence. “Mashed potatoes,” she says quietly. “And the broccoli cheddar soup.” She cringes as if the ghost of Thanos will materialize at any moment to berate her for her selections.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha praises, plucking the menu from her hand. “We’ll cross the dessert bridge when we come to it.”</p><p>“Dessert?” she repeats, anxiety simmering under the word.</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Obviously, dessert. I was thinking something a little more grown-up than the ice cream Nicky’s been living off of. Tiramisu, perhaps. Or cannolis. Hell, maybe both — when in Sicily — but as I said, we haven’t gotten to that bridge yet.” She waves her hand. “So what are you adding to your bucket list? Since you crossed pornographically named sharks off?”</p><p>Rio shrugs. “I wasn’t really going to add anything.”</p><p>“Well, you should — it’d be a shame to run out of shit to live for.” It’s a joke, but it also…kind of isn’t. “What else do you have left on it, then?”</p><p>“I guess I’ve always sort of wanted to get into gardening? Maybe even grow my own weed.”</p><p>“Used to do that in high school. Very lucrative. Happy to give you pointers. But I’m going to need you to dream bigger than one of my teenage hobbies.” </p><p>“I don’t have anything else right now.”</p><p>“I don’t believe that. The only way you survive years locked in a tower is dreaming about what you’re going to do when you bust out of it."</p><p>“My career is what kept me going,” Rio counters. “Not dreams about the future.”</p><p>“You’re every capitalist overlord’s fantasy.”</p><p>She frowns, a flicker of hurt crossing her features. “I love my job. It gives me purpose.”</p><p>Agatha softens a little. “I know, honey — I was mostly just giving you a hard time.” She swirls some water around in her glass and desperately wishes the waiter had already brought the bottle of white wine she’d ordered. “I…even understand,” she adds, a little crumb of vulnerability to make up for the fact she’d accidentally upset her. “To an extent. I think.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“Nicky,” she says simply. Quietly.</p><p>“Nicky…what?”</p><p>“Is what kept me going when...” She shakes her head a little, eyes still fixed on the water glass. “Maybe it doesn’t count. It was still a dream about the future — it’s just that the future I was dreaming about was his.”</p><p>Agatha sees Rio tilt her head out of the corner of her eye. “What do you mean?”</p><p>She takes a deep inhale, blows it out slowly through her mouth as if it’s cigarette smoke. “He was sick as a baby. He's <em>still</em> sick, but he was really sick back then. I…pretty much wanted to die,” she admits, clearing her throat. She’d never said that aloud — never allowed herself to name a feeling so weak and contrary to her brand of fighting at any cost, of surviving by any means necessary. “But I couldn’t. It was my job to stay alive to make sure he did, too.” She downs the water in one large swig. “I knew, from the moment he was born, that one second without him would be infinitely more painful than all those years with her combined.”</p><p>“That makes sense,” Rio gently replies. “I’m glad that you’re both still here.”</p><p>She gives her a nod and shifts in her seat. She hadn’t expected it — to be quite that open. To confess to something she never had before, and without it being forced out of her. It was jarring. Disorienting, even. She looks left and right — anywhere other than at Rio. “Where’s the waiter with that fucking wine?” she mutters.</p><p>Rio purses her lips, her pointer tracing the lid of her water glass. “My job allows me to help survivors — give them hope. It made me feel good, giving people a chance at a better life, even if I couldn’t have one myself.”</p><p>There’s a strong temptation to simply rehash the argument they’d had at the beginning of the trip — the one about the stupidity of having hope, of trying to be helpful, of not looking out for yourself first and foremost. It would fit Agatha’s pattern and be much more comfortable, familiar territory than engaging with the topic on any meaningful level.</p><p>It would also — at least partially — be a lie. (It had always at least partially been a lie, though Rio is the first one who’d ever been able to get her to admit that, too, even to herself.)</p><p>“It’s how I feel about being a mother,” she softly muses, bringing her water glass to her lips again.</p><p>“That’s empty, you know,” Rio bluntly points out. </p><p>She flushes in embarrassment, dropping the bone-dry glass back onto the table and sliding it away. </p><p>“But I’m glad you have that,” Rio adds. “It’s tangible — something that you can hold onto.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “It isn’t, though. Not really. As hard as I try to hang onto him, he still slips away. Long days when my ex has custody. Surgeries I can’t be in the room for. Even just the fact he’s getting older — doesn’t want me or need me the way he used to."</p><p>“That’s because he’s not an object,” Rio reasons. “He’ll always love you, but he doesn’t have to be attached at your hip to do that.”</p><p>“I know he’s not an <em>object</em>,” she says, a little defensive. “The other part…” She runs her tongue over her teeth. “I’m not so sure. The more he learns about me — the kind of things I’ve done, the kind of person I am…”</p><p>“Then use him as motivation to be better.”</p><p>“That’s what I’ve <em>been</em> doing,” she says, the defensiveness flaring up more. “That’s what I’ve been doing with <em>you</em>, too.”</p><p>Oh. Oh, fuck. Definitely hadn't meant to let that part slip.</p><p>Thank god the stupid waiter kid finally chooses that moment to approach the table with their bottle of wine. “Took you long enough,” Agatha mumbles, taking a swig as soon as the waiter pours her a glass and ordering food for both of them. She’d love to say she does this to be romantic, but mostly, she just doesn’t trust Rio not to chicken out and get something ‘safer’ last minute — nor does she trust herself not to get up and run away from the table to avoid continuing this conversation.</p><p>“I’m going to need you to elaborate,” Rio says once the server leaves.</p><p>“Elaborate on what?”</p><p>She gives her a look. “Agatha…”</p><p>She finishes the rest of her glass before reaching for the wine bottle again. “Lilia told me that I should try to be better for you. For some reason I still can’t fathom, I took the old bat’s advice.”</p><p>“Why me?”</p><p>Agatha blinks, the bottle freezing halfway to her glass. “What the fuck do you mean, ‘Why you’?”</p><p>“Exactly what I said.”</p><p>“Is it not obvious by now that I— I—“ She chokes on the word, as if it’s too large to force out. </p><p>Rio raises a brow. “That you what?” </p><p>“Love you,” she blurts, shoving the word from her mouth — setting the damn genie free from its lamp — before she can think too hard about it. She decides not to even bother pouring herself another glass of wine, beginning to chug directly from the bottle instead. It earns her a few odd looks, but she’s never cared about that, and she’s never cared less than in this very moment, when she’d just confessed her feelings to a woman she met less than a week ago.</p><p>“You…you do?”</p><p>She stops drinking just long enough to mumble, “Do you think I just go around saying that willy fucking nilly?” before promptly putting the bottle back to her lips.</p><p>Rio reaches across the table and grabs it from her, clutching it annoyingly out of reach. “You’re not going to be drunk for a conversation like this.”</p><p>She scoffs. “You think I get drunk off of one measly bottle of wine? Don’t insult me.”</p><p>“You’re missing my point. I want to have a serious conversation without alcohol.”</p><p>“Fine.” She sighs, pulling a cigarette out of her bag. She catches a glimpse of Rio’s disapproving expression as she goes to light it. “What?” she asks. “You gotta give me <em>something</em> here.”</p><p>“No, I don’t. I want you to be sober when we speak about this.”</p><p>She chews on the inside of her cheek, cigarette still unlit between her fingers. She’d normally tell whoever requested that to fuck right off, but she seemed incapable of saying that to Rio’s face. “Does that include nicotine, or can I smoke this?”</p><p>“Includes nicotine.”</p><p>She rolls her eyes, though she flicks the lighter shut and drops it and the cigarette onto the table, sitting back in her seat and crossing her arms. She feels vaguely like she’s back in high school, having been called to the principal’s office. Those instances were plentiful and much more pleasant than the situation she currently found herself in.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio says, taking a deep breath as she collects her thoughts. “It’s not that I don’t reciprocate your feelings, but I need to know that you really mean it.”</p><p>She squints. “And I need you to not do that pussy-ass double-negative thing. ‘It’s <em>not</em> that you <em>don’t</em>’ — then say that you <em>do</em>,” she insists, equal parts a plea and a dare.</p><p>“I need you to promise before I can say it.”</p><p>“And I need you to say it before I can promise,” she retorts. “I just leapt off a cliff, Rio," she adds more quietly. "It’s not fair to ask me to do anything more until you jump, too.”</p><p>“I just got out of an abusive relationship where my love was weaponized,” Rio reminds her. “I need to know that won’t happen again.”</p><p>“It won’t,” she vows. “But I grew up around a woman with no love for me at all. I need to know <em>that</em> won’t happen again, either.”</p><p>“We wouldn’t have gotten to this juncture if that were the case.”</p><p>“I still need to hear the actual words from your mouth.”</p><p>Rio rubs her face with a sigh. “Agatha, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t. I can give you that, but I need <em>you</em> to give me some safety here.”</p><p>“Well, I can’t do that,” she admits, blunt but not unkind. “There’s nothing safe about this, sweetheart — for either of us. It’s the most dangerous thing in the world, these matters of the fucking heart."</p><p>Fuck, she wishes that wine wasn't so far away. That she could reach for the cigarette next to her.</p><p>"But I’m willing to risk it," she continues. "I’m willing to risk everything in the world for you because I love you. I love you. I. <em>Love</em>. You.” Her voice cracks, an unexpected slip of fragility in the middle of the firm declaration. “And I need you to look. Me in. The eye. And say it back.”</p><p>Rio purses her lips, staring at her for a long, long moment. “I love you,” she says, voice just as quiet. “I love you, too.”</p><p>She’d begged for it — demanded it, really — but now that Rio had said it, she doesn’t know quite what to do with it. How to process it. It's like the sun shining directly on her after she'd been holed up in a cave for years: overwhelming in its brightness, in the heat it makes her feel all over. She nods, squirming a little as her gaze drops down to the tablecloth. “Good,” she awkwardly says. “Thank you.”</p><p>“But now I need to know that you’ll try,” Rio presses. “That this is serious for you.”</p><p>Agatha blows out a frustrated breath as tears burn in her eyes. “I’m doing everything I can to show you that I am and that it is.” <em>But it’s not enough</em>, the little voice says. <em>You’re not enough, and you never will be</em>. </p><p>She forces herself to look up at Rio, both more intense and vulnerable than she’s ever been with her. Maybe than she’s ever been period. “I’m giving you everything that I have. I need you to decide if you’re going to take it — if you’re going to choose all of it, and all of me, and all the shit that entails.”</p><p>She purses her lips. As much as she might not want to, it wouldn’t be right, not giving her an out. “If you’re going to leave it, I’d understand," she says more softly. "I wouldn’t fault you. But if so, I need you to do it now. Because if you change your mind later, I…” She shakes her head, sucks in a sharp inhale. Any more time spent basking in the sun of Rio's existence, and she would not be able to figure out how to live without its warmth again. “I won’t recover.”</p><p>Rio softens a little at that. “I want to take it. I want you — all of you.”</p><p>Maybe Agatha, in all her selfishness, is allowing Rio to make the biggest mistake in her mistake-filled life. Agatha can’t quite bring herself to care at this moment. Agatha can’t do anything except work against her very nature — perhaps fate itself — to try and make it the right choice.</p><p>“Then you got me,” she whispers. She places her hand halfway across the table, palm up — an invitation. “All of me.”</p><p>Instead of holding her hand, Rio begins to play with Agatha’s fingers — an even more intimate action, somehow. She was letting her guard down, quietly taking what she needed without fear of judgment. “Could we get the cheesecake for dessert?” she quietly asks.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curves into a smile. There’s a strange feeling stirring in her chest. Pride, maybe. Or that hope thing Rio had mentioned. “Sure, honey. Whatever you want.”</p><p>The tender moment is interrupted by a few Italian cops — the same ones who questioned Rio — approaching their table. “Signoras? We need to speak with you.”</p>

<p>Rio straightens her posture as she looks at the cops. “Okay.” She gives them a small nod. “Sure.”</p><p>“Make it quick,” Agatha snaps, covering up for the fact that she’s internally far less cool and collected about the sudden police presence than Rio seems to be, considering her own experience with the law. She’s tempted to get up and bolt — it would be just her luck, getting arrested for fraud or identity theft or one of the other dozen crimes she hadn’t been caught for yet right now — but Rio’s still holding onto her fingers, and she can’t bear to take that small comfort from her.</p><p>“We’ve been continuing our investigation — going over the case with a fine-tooth comb,” one of them says.</p><p>“So your job,” Agatha says. “You’ve been doing your job. Do you want a gold star? Or maybe a cookie? Shall we throw a parade? Create a holiday in your honor? Considering how useless most of you are, I suppose I do understand why you think this warrants a special congratulations, but—“</p><p>“The evidence overwhelmingly points to self-defense, just as you said,” he tells Rio. “That’s what we’re ruling in our official report. We wanted to personally let you know the case is now closed.”</p><p>Rio closes her eyes, breathing out a deep sigh of relief. “Thank you for telling me.”</p><p>“Of course.” He nods. “We hope you enjoyed Sicily otherwise. That you’ll visit again soon.”</p><p>“What are you, the fucking tourism board?” Agatha asks, dismissing them with the wave of her hand. “You can go.”</p><p>She should be relieved, too, but it feels too…easy. Goodness and truth didn’t ever just prevail like that. (Did they?) You didn’t get anywhere without some lying and cheating. (Did you?) The other shoe always dropped. (Didn’t it?)</p><p>Rio settles back into her chair, taking her hand with her. Agatha misses its absence immediately — the softness. The warmth. The safe grounding of her touch. Had she always secretly craved that so much? “This is good,” she muses.</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha mumbles in something she hopes sounds like agreement.</p><p>“I feel a little better now.”</p><p>“Let’s just hope Floppy Boy Band Hair-os doesn’t fuck things up on the monster-in-law front.”</p><p>“Former,” Rio corrects. “Please. I don’t want to be associated with her in the present tense.”</p><p>“Right. You have quite the track record with those, don’t you? Between his and mine. Of course, mine had the good sense to die. And we’re not, you know, married. Obviously.” Agatha awkwardly clears her throat, reaching across the table. “Can I have the wine back now?”</p><p>She hands it over with a half-warning look. “Don’t drink the whole thing.”</p><p>“Oh, you want a sip?” Agatha asks facetiously, cocking a brow as she takes it. She knows Rio just wants her coherent, but <em>she</em> just wants to have a little fun in the midst of all this seriousness. She seductively curves her pointer. “Lean forward and open your mouth.”</p><p>Rio furrows her brows, looking down at her cup. “But my glass is still full.”</p><p>She sighs, having <em>Lady and the Tramp</em> flashbacks. “I thought it would be sexy to see you do,” she explains — bluntly, both because she had no shame and because that’s the only thing that worked on Rio. “And sort of romantic, hand-feeding you grapes like they did for royalty in Ancient Greece.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio’s cheeks grow pink. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>She raises a brow. “What was that? I could’ve sworn I just heard a ‘sorry’ come out of your mouth, but I know that can’t be right considering that word isn’t in your vocabulary anymore.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head, fiddling with the napkin on her lap. “Well, I was dumb, so I ruined something.”</p><p>“No, your autism popped out, so you misunderstood,” Agatha corrects. “I think I’ll survive without the frat party activity of pouring alcohol down your throat.”</p><p>She takes her bottom lip between her teeth. “You sure I didn’t mess up?”</p><p>“Have you ever seen me hold back on telling someone when they messed up, Rio?” Agatha deadpans.</p><p>“I guess not,” she mutters.</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Rio’s silent for a moment before relenting. “Squamous,” she amends under her breath.</p><p>“There you go,” Agatha says, rewarding her by leaning down to kiss her hand and topping up her glass. “I love it when you talk dirty to me.”</p><p>Rio takes her first sip, a pleased little sound escaping her throat.</p><p>“Good, right?”</p><p>“Very.” </p><p>“I told you, I don’t drink that cheap shit.” Agatha pours another hearty glass and takes a sip of her own — much larger than Rio’s, more like a swig, really. She needs it. She needs far more than it, honestly, to broach the topic she’s desperately put off multiple times for multiple days, but she doesn’t want Rio to go snatching the bottle away from her again.  </p><p>“So,” she starts. “Tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio must hear the trepidation in her voice, as she narrows her eyes and proactively reaches across the table to snag the wine anyway.</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha protests, attempting, in vain, to snatch it back.</p><p>Rio promptly ignores her, setting it near the edge of her side of the table. “What about it?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a frustrated sigh. “Well, we fly back to the United States of Assholes.” She squirms in her seat, still — for some reason — trying to skirt around the increasingly large elephant in the room. “Lilia lives in Brooklyn, too, you know. Maybe she'll be on the same flight as you. Are you going into JFK or LaGuardia?”</p><p>“Newark, actually.”</p><p>“Newark,” she repeats. She hadn’t been expecting that. Again, what are the odds? What are the fucking odds? “I guess that means you’ll be on the same one as me.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio says, her expression annoyingly unreadable. “That’s lucky.”</p><p>On the one hand, it certainly was very lucky indeed. On the other hand, it was almost…too lucky. So lucky that it wrapped around to being something of a curse. There were no excuses now to chicken out.</p><p>“You said your dad was picking you up at the airport?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio slowly replies. “Last he told me.”</p><p>“Do you…” She clears her throat. Fuck, she couldn’t do this. But she had to do this. Was she seriously doing this? “You think he’d have room in his car for one more?” She shakes her head. “Maybe you don’t know. Maybe <em>he</em> doesn’t even know if he’s planning to rent it when he gets there. Though I can’t imagine there are a lot of sexy two-seater convertibles at the airport’s Enterprise, nor do I think your father would get one for the two of you."</p><p>Rio’s brows furrow in confusion. “Yeah, there’s…probably an extra seat…”</p><p>“To be clear, I…meant I’d be going to Brooklyn with you. Not trying to hitch a ride back to Westview. That would be...psychotic." And something she would, admittedly, absolutely do.</p><p>She blinks. “You’d want to go there with me?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs, swirling the last few drops of wine around in her glass, rationing them for when she really, really needed more liquid courage. “Six hands are better than four, right? For packing? Plus, that way, we can go through and separate all of the ugly shit your undearly departed picked out that needs to be burned in a fire from the good shit I want you to move into my place.”</p><p>Rio chews on her lip for a few seconds. “I am a little excited to find clothes I actually like,” she admits.</p><p>“I’m sure you’ll look even more beautiful in them. Though I’m even more sure that my favorite look on you is always going to be in nothing at all.”</p><p>A blush creeps into Rio’s cheeks as she looks down at the perfectly ironed tablecloth. “Will you go shopping with me? Help me narrow down all the options?” The thought of that — the newfound autonomy — clearly overwhelms her more than she’d like to admit.</p><p>“Don’t have to ask me twice,” Agatha flippantly agrees. “Especially if that invitation includes entry into the fitting room with you. Lost my virginity in one of those, you know. In a mall, no less — aggressively ‘80s of me. Way hotter than you might think, though, with the big mirror.” She allows herself a moment of wistful reminiscence. “God, I looked incredible.”</p><p>“You’re always horny, aren’t you?” Rio asks, though the affectionate snort that accompanies it says she doesn’t mind one bit.</p><p>“You’re just noticing this?”</p><p>“Well, it’s obvious now.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah?” Agatha rests her chin in her hand, batting her lashes. “What else has become oh-so-clear about me this week?”</p><p>“That you care,” Rio says, casual yet confident and without missing a beat.</p><p>“Hm.” Her gaze drops down her wine glass, the straightforward sincerity of the statement almost too much to bear. “And here I thought I was being subtle.”</p><p>“You’re bad at that.”</p><p>She scoffs, offended enough to look back up at her. “Am not.”</p><p>“Are too,” Rio insists, the corner of her mouth curving into a small, mischievous smile.</p><p>She places a hand over her heart, faux-wounded. “Why do you want to hurt me so?”</p><p>“It’s not <em>my</em> fault you can’t be discreet.”</p><p>“There a reason you glossed over my invitation to participate in the time-honored lesbian tradition of U-hauling with me, then?” she asks, deciding now is the time to take her last emergency drink of wine. “Seeing as how it must’ve been pretty overt?”</p><p>Rio bites the inside of her cheek. “It’s not that I’m against it,” she explains, voice quiet. “I just don’t want to rush.”</p><p>“<em>You’re</em> the one who kept asking to come stay with me,” Agatha points out. “I thought the idea of doing it on a more permanent basis would make you happy.”</p><p>“It does,” she promises. “I’m just…scared.”</p><p>Agatha taps her nails against the side of her empty glass. “Me too,” she forces herself to confess.</p><p>“I wish I could find a way not to be.”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha hums again. She sure as hell wishes the same. Being scared was one of her least-favorite feelings, right next to being wrong. (Thankfully, the latter didn't happen often.) “On the bright side, you’ve already done the hardest part — of leaving him. The rest should be a cake walk in comparison. Cheesecake walk, since you like that better.”</p><p>The ghost of a smile appears on her face, which Agatha takes as a win, considering her humor often fell flat with her. “I know. It just feels…weird. I haven’t been this free in years, you know?”</p><p>“Well, my sham court-ordered therapists were always going on and on about the benefits of maintaining structure and routine. Nicky needs driven to school at the ass-crack of dawn every morning I have him.” A beat. “If, you know, you did move in.” Another. “And you’d be interested in that.” </p><p>“I have work early,” Rio reminds her. “And it’ll be a pretty long commute into the city from Westview.”</p><p>“Right. Duh.” She shakes her head, the heat of embarrassment creeping into her cheeks. <em>Nice going, Agatha — in trying to give her a reason to get out of bed, you’d minimized her job. Instead of communicating that you trusted her around your kid, you sounded like you were pawning off babysitting duties on her. By suggesting—</em></p><p>“But I’d be more than happy to help him with homework at night,” Rio offers, breaking her out of her spiral.</p><p>She relaxes a little at that. “Even better, honestly. Those stupid worksheets are only going to get harder, and I barely got my diploma.”</p><p>Rio gives her a look. “You know I don’t like it when you do that.” </p><p>“Do what? It’s a fact. I think my GPA was 1.8 on a good day.”</p><p>“Yeah, but you <em>could’ve</em> graduated with honors if you’d put your mind to it. If you actually did the homework and showed up to take the tests. You’re naturally curious and a quick learner, so if you’d had any kind of support at home…”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “What are you, my guidance counselor?”</p><p>She holds her gaze, expression serious. “Just a person who sees that you’re a lot more intelligent than you give yourself credit for.”</p><p>“Not true — I know I’m brilliant.”</p><p>“You know you’re street-smart. I know you’re more than that.”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips, staring longingly at the bottle of wine Rio is hoarding across the table. </p><p>Luckily, Rio changes the subject. “Maybe we could do a weekly movie night, too?”</p><p>“Considering you’ve seen absolutely nothing and understand approximately zero of my references, we can even bump it up to twice a week if you’d like.”</p><p>“I watch stuff,” Rio defends. “Just…stuff I’m interested in.”</p><p>“Well, let’s see if we can’t get you interested in some of the classics.” Agatha immediately wrinkles her nose. “God, I sound like my ex. That’s disgusting.” She motions for Rio to hand her the wine bottle. “Please, I need something to get that awful taste out of my mouth.”</p><p>Instead of giving it to her, Rio pours a little into her glass. “Maybe we start with horror. I tend to like that genre.”</p><p>“I know. Because the characters in those usually have more fucked-up lives than you. You also can’t stand rom-coms and find reality TV annoying,” she recites, nearly verbatim from their conversation from the previous morning. She sips the stingy bit of wine Rio’s poured her. “I listen to you, Rio. I listen, and I remember everything.”</p><p>Rio shifts in her seat, glancing down at the table once more. “I didn’t know if you would. Nothing against you — just, you know…used to being ignored.”</p><p>“Well, you’d better get used to me paying attention.” She reaches across the table, lifting her chin so she has no choice but to look at her. “You can’t hide from me, sweetheart.”</p><p>“I don’t want to,” she softly assures her. “It’s new, that's all.”</p><p>“Of course it is. It has to be, considering we’re talking about me here, and I’m certainly nowhere in the ballpark of old.” She stares into her eyes for another moment before her gaze travels down a few inches. “If you’re not going to give me any more wine,” she purrs, “may I at least have another taste of it off your mouth?”</p><p>A faint crease of confusion appears between Rio’s brows. “That’s you asking to kiss me, right?”</p><p>The corner of Agatha’s mouth curves into a small, affectionate smirk. “Yes, dear,” she confirms. “Or you can kiss me if you’d rather — makes no difference to me.”</p><p>Rio leans forward to give Agatha a brief, tender peck. “There.” She pulls back with a coy grin. Bratty little tease. “That good?”</p><p>“Mm.” She narrows her eyes. “You know, I think you’d better do it again — much, much slower — so I can be 100% sure.”</p><p>Rio obliges with a deeper kiss, her lips lingering.</p><p>Agatha moans into it, the noise turning to a groan as she feels her phone vibrate. She reluctantly pulls back and rips it from her pocket, glancing at the screen.</p><p>“Ginger Bitch,” she notes before flashing Rio an apologetic look. “Usually, I’d ignore it, but I have to ask her if she’ll pick Nicky up from the airport tomorrow.” She accepts the call and holds it to her ear, annoyance immediately overtaking her features once more. “<em>What</em>?”</p><p>“You seriously can’t even give me a ‘hi’?” Wanda asks, equally irritated. “It’s literally fewer letters.”</p><p>“Same number of syllables, though.”</p><p>“Whatever.” </p><p>“Same word with two extra syllables added on,” Agatha obnoxiously points out.</p><p>“Do you want to hear the good news I have or not?”</p><p>“Ohh, can I guess?” Agatha asks, proceeding to do so without waiting for an answer. “You’re moving to Mars? You have two months to live? You—“</p><p>“Talked to Thanos’ mother.”</p><p>Agatha scowls. “How the fuck is that <em>good</em> news? Moreover, how the fuck is that any of <em>your</em> business?”</p><p>“You kind of <em>made</em> it my business when you introduced me to Rio.”</p><p>“I did not <em>introduce you to Rio</em> — you coerced me into handing her the phone last night.”</p><p>“Is she there? Put me on speaker.”</p><p>“We’re at dinner — that’d be rude.”</p><p>Wanda scoffs. “Wow, you sure picked a convenient time to start giving a shit about manners. Let me talk to her, or I'll call her myself and not tell you anything. I was doing you a courtesy by looping you in." She shifts into an (in Agatha's opinion, terrible) impression of her voice. "'Thank you, Wanda.' You're welcome, Agatha."</p><p>"Eat shit," Agatha says, though she does comply by putting the phone on speaker and placing it in the middle of the table.</p><p>Rio blinks at the harsh, jarring turn the conversation has rapidly taken. “Um, hi, Wanda.”</p><p>“Hi, Rio. See how easy that greeting was, Agatha? Maybe she can teach you later.”</p><p>“Oh, if you think <em>that’s</em> impressive, you’d be <em>amazed</em> at the other things her tongue can do in all <em>kinds</em> of places,” Agatha retorts.</p><p>“Well, if one of those places is down your throat, she’s doing me a favor, considering that's the only way you ever shut up,” Wanda says sweetly.</p><p>“Hey, you.” Agatha flags down their waiter, who, lucky for her (and very unlucky for him), happens to be walking past their table.</p><p>“Y— yes?” he asks. “Is there a problem?”</p><p>“Yeah, take this back to the kitchen.” Agatha gestures to the phone. “I don’t recall ordering an appetizer of self-righteous cunt.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio scolds.</p><p>“Uh…” His eyes widen and dart between Agatha and Rio, the rest of his body frozen for a few beats. “I’m gonna go check on your food,” he announces before scurrying away.</p><p>“As I was saying, Rio,” Wanda continues, ignoring Agatha’s childish antics, “I talked to Thanos’ mother. Well, technically, I talked to some guy named Eros first?”</p><p>Rio fixes Agatha with a warning glare as she replies, “Uh-huh. That’s his brother.”</p><p>“Right. Well, I saw him in the Facebook comments of that post someone forwarded me about you. He was agreeing with some really offensive things.”</p><p>“Huh.” Agatha nods, vaguely impressed. “Honestly, I didn’t think he had it in him.”</p><p>“It was disgusting,” Wanda continues. “I don’t know what came over me — I’m usually not so rash — but I messaged him saying he was a hateful, ignorant son of a bitch who didn’t know the truth from his bony ass.”</p><p>Agatha blinks. “Honestly, I…didn’t really think you had that in you, either,” she admits. “But Eros is—“ </p><p>“Yeah, yeah — on your side. I cracked him in about two minutes, and I got him to give me his mom’s phone number in five.”</p><p>“Then what happened?” Rio prompts, biting her thumbnail.</p><p>“I gave her a call. We had a very…productive conversation,” she diplomatically replies.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “I refuse to grovel for details from you, Red—” she says, undoubtedly irritated, though the old, almost fond nickname slips out with it for the first time in years. Damn Rio for making her so soft. Damn Wanda for being so good to Rio. </p><p>“Once again, I’ve been blonde for years,” Wanda mumbles. </p><p>Agatha promptly ignores her. “—but Rio deserves to know what went down.”</p><p>“Please,” Rio quietly pleads. </p><p>There’s a beat before Wanda sighs. “We have a few mutual acquaintances — that’s how the post got sent to me in the first place. I know for a fact that a few of them have some pretty damning evidence that she’s talked badly behind the backs of everyone in her powerful little circle. She’s already lost everything once — became a social pariah after her divorce — and she did not want to risk it happening again, which is highly likely if proof of her nasty gossip habit were to ever get leaked.”</p><p>“So you blackmailed her,” Agatha infers. </p><p>“I simply told her that this was not the right way to grieve and hinted that it would be wise for her to stop spreading lies about the innocent woman her son relentlessly tormented. Oh, and to donate the money she raised for Thanos’ GoFundMe to the local domestic violence shelter.” </p><p>She snorts. “You dirty fucking dog. I don’t know whether to be proud that you actually took a page out of my playbook for once or furious that you’re such a goddamn hypocrite for doing it.”</p><p>“Did— did she agree?” Rio asks, now anxiously scratching at her arm. Agatha wordlessly reaches across the table and takes the offending hand in her own before she can draw blood. “What’d she say?”</p><p>“She said a lot of things,” Wanda vaguely admits. “The conversation wasn’t particularly short, and she wasn’t particularly thrilled about any of it, but eventually, we...reached an understanding. She’s taken the posts down, called off the cavalry, and promised to write a check totaling just shy of $40,000 by morning. Let’s just say I can be very…persuasive when I want to be.”</p><p>Rio takes a deep inhale. “Holy fucking shit,” she whispers. </p><p>Holy fucking shit indeed. Sweet relief and bitter insecurity flood through Agatha in equal measure as this all sinks in. The best possible outcome had been achieved by the worst possible person. Life sure had a twisted sense of humor.</p><p>Rio clears her throat and grips Agatha’s hand — clinging on with everything she has, just as she promised. Giving Agatha the safe, grounding warmth of her touch that she hadn’t even admitted that she needed. Maybe it means something that their fingers lock together like two pieces of Nicky’s half-finished jigsaw puzzle spread out across the coffee table.</p><p>“Is this for real?” Rio asks, somehow even quieter than before.</p><p>“I wouldn’t lie about this,” Wanda vows.</p><p>“She wouldn’t,” Agatha agrees, voice softer now, too. Wanda was too good to do anything like that. Wanda was too good at everything. Too <em>good</em>, period. </p><p>She squeezes Rio’s hand and tries so very hard to swallow her pride — swallow the anxiety that there were now very likely two shoes dangling over her head (weren’t there? Surely, there had to be) — as she looks in her eyes and gives her a half-forced smile. “I think it’s really over, honey.”</p><p>Rio slowly nods, her brain clearly attempting to process all of this. To begin to figure out what ‘over’ looks like, what ‘over’ means for her. She sucks in a shaky breath, tears — of relief? Of overwhelm? Of apprehension? Or maybe some combination of all three — forming in her eyes. “Th— thank you.”</p><p>Agatha reaches up to cup her cheek, lightly brushing a tear away with her thumb.</p><p>“It’s all thanks to Agatha, really,” Wanda surprises her by saying. “Eros told me she came up with that plan, and I wouldn’t have done all of this had she not spoken so highly of you on the phone last night.”</p><p>Now that <em>is</em> a blatant lie. All Wanda did was help everyone all the time. How did Agatha always somehow fall for these bleeding hearts?</p><p>“Oh, stop being modest, Red — it doesn’t suit you at all,” Agatha snarks — she was always so nauseatingly <em>humble</em>, so gratingly <em>gracious</em> — though there’s an undercurrent of sincere gratitude peeking through at her passing the credit along. At painting Agatha as some kind of hero. At making her look…well…good, too.</p><p><em>Good</em>.</p><p>She’s still not sure that’s something she can be. </p><p>But despite everything (her fear, her pessimism, and her better judgment), she thinks perhaps it’s something she’ll allow herself to feel right now, staring at the woman she loves — the woman who loves her in return — on their last night at this luxury Sicilian resort.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>There’s a strange sense of déjà vu the next morning as Agatha, Rio, and Nicky check out of their room, trudge through the resort property, and board the same boat that had brought them all there in the first place.</span></p><p><span>Once the stupid waiter kid (Billy, Agatha had finally bothered to learn as he handed her a glass of champagne for the ride back) and the rest of the staff wave them off as they depart the dock, Agatha scans everyone on board. Yes, the trip had changed her — probably changed her far more than she even realizes yet, than she will ever let herself admit — but old habits died hard.</span></p><p><span>Jen glares at her from the bench she’s sitting on, while Alice gives her a small smile. Agatha had written them off at the beginning of the trip as irrelevant, irritating, and self-involved, and she’d been pretty spot-on in her assessment, if she did say so herself. She’d pat herself on the back if both of her hands weren’t currently occupied, but holding an outrageously expensive drink and touching an outrageously beautiful woman both took priority.</span></p><p><span>Lilia has her head buried in virtual Tetris, looking up only when Nicky pokes her in the arm to spout off Sicily facts — something that happens rather frequently. Better her than Agatha, especially since Lilia spouts just as many right back at him. They matched each other’s extremely boring trivia-loving freak. She’d been…half-right about the old bat. She is kooky and ridiculous, though she’s not quite as stupid as Agatha had initially thought. Not quite as useless.</span></p><p><span>And then there was Rio. Instead of Thanos’ possessive palm on her leg this time around, it’s Agatha’s own hand that’s resting on her knee. She’d been…well, she’d been all wrong about her. And while that was bad for her ego, it had turned out to be pretty damn good for everything else, so she supposed she’d take the tradeoff.</span></p><p><span>“You really meant it?” Rio asks, interrupting Agatha’s mental end-of-trip evaluations. “That you’ll come help me pack up?” Her voice grows quieter. “That you want me to move in?”</span></p><p><span>“For the—” She counts in her head the number of occasions that question had already been posed between the previous night and that morning. It would have been five, but Agatha had cut her off with a kiss at breakfast. “—four and halfth time? Yes. I meant it. Wanda’s picking Nicky up at the airport — it’s all set.”</span></p><p><span>“Do you think she’ll like Shelly?” Nicky asks, taking out a shell he’d found on the beach from his pocket — the souvenir he’d decided to gift his mom with. Despite establishing a dynamic that resembled something in the ballpark of civility at the end of their phone call last night, Agatha sure as hell wasn’t spending money on Wanda, even with Sharon Davis’ credit card.</span></p><p><span>“For the </span><em><span>eighth</span></em><span> time, yes. I’m sure she will.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiles at him. “Say hi to her for me, Nicky.”</span></p><p><span>“I will!” He grins.</span></p><p><span>“Do not say hi to her for me, Nicky,” Agatha half-teases, which really is an improvement considering that, at the beginning of this trip, there would have been no trace of joking in that statement at all.</span></p><p><span>“So,” Rio says, deftly changing the subject. “Will I finally get to meet the famous Señor Scratchy?”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, you and Scratchy will get well-acquainted,” Agatha confirms. “He sleeps with me every night, so you’ll have to fight him for the left side of the bed.”</span></p><p><span>“He’s a rabbit. How much room does he need?”</span></p><p><span>“He’s chunky.” Nicky giggles.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, because you sneak him food when you think I’m not looking,” Agatha says. She tickles his stomach, which turns the giggles into squeals of laughter. “He’s the king of the house — absolutely spoiled rotten.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not surprised, from what I’ve heard,” Rio affectionately admits. “He’s…friendly, right? Like, you think he’ll like me?”</span></p><p><span>“He’s easily bribed. Give him a carrot to gnaw on, and you’ll have his endless devotion.”</span></p><p><span>“Good to know.”</span></p><p><span>“Mm,” she hums in agreement. “Any more rabbit-related questions or concerns?”</span></p><p><span>Rio shrugs a shoulder, taking her bottom lip between her teeth. “Not necessarily.”</span></p><p><span>“Non-rabbit-related questions or concerns, then.” The hand resting on Rio’s knee travels up to rub at her inner thigh — not high enough to raise eyebrows or scar Nicky, but high enough to bloom goosebumps on Rio's skin. "You have those?”</span></p><p><span>She swallows hard, though whether it’s from being turned on by Agatha’s touch, being apprehensive at sharing her response, or some combination of the two isn’t clear. “I think I’m still just scared,” she confesses as Nicky turns to blab something to Lilia. “Not of anything tangible — just…the future, I guess.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nods, sucking in an inhale. She could do this. She could help. She was capable of making things better instead of worse, despite all prior evidence to the contrary. Lilia believed that, and so did Rio, so maybe she could, too. “You know the best way to eat an elephant?"</span></p><p><span>Rio tilts her head, brows furrowing. “What do you mean?”</span></p><p><span>“Just a dumb proverb about approaching big tasks — big things like the future.” She waves her glass of champagne, expertly managing to spill nary a drop. “You try to eat the elephant too fast, you get sick, especially if you go in famished. You’re the biology major — you must know what refeeding syndrome is.”</span></p><p><span>That’s what Agatha had done. What she’d suffered from. There had been this whole world, this whole feast, on the other side of her mother. And considering Evanora had starved her of nutrients — of support, of care, of love — the minute she could break away from her, she’d gorged herself on freedom. On drugs, on alcohol, on meaningless sex to try and feel fed. (She never did.)</span></p><p><span>Rio, on the other hand, was clearly terrified to taste it at all. Scared to pick up a fork and knife and get to work.</span></p><p><span>“But you do have to eat it,” Agatha says more gently. “You have to <em>eat</em>, Rio.” She means this in a metaphorical elephant sense and a very literal one, too. “And the best way to consume it is taking it one—“ She kisses Rio's jaw. “—bite—“ She nips at her bottom lip. “—at a time.” She finishes with a long, lingering kiss on her lips before pressing their foreheads together. “Just one bite at a time. That’s all,” she whispers.</span></p><p><span>Rio sinks into the touch — as easy for her, it seems, as breathing. “I don’t know where to start.”</span></p><p><span>“Start here. With me.”</span></p><p><span>“How?”</span></p><p><span>“Just be here. Be <em>here</em>. Now. Not dwelling on what’s happened. Not worrying about what might.”</span></p><p><span>She sounds like a hypocrite, giving her advice she doesn't live her own jaded, cynical life by. (Impulsivity, after all, was not the same as living in the moment. As being present.) And while Agatha doesn’t particularly have a problem with her own hypocrisy, she intends to practice what she’s preaching this time.</span></p><p><span>This wasn’t real life, of course — the two of them on this boat. This was a vacation, was fantasy, was paradise. Things would be infinitely more difficult when they both woke up without the sound of waves hitting the shore outside their window, without the smell of a freshly prepared breakfast buffet wafting its way through the door.</span></p><p><span>No, this wasn’t reality.</span></p><p><span>But fuck it. Agatha had spent a large percentage of her life living a nightmare, so she’d let herself exist in a dream for once, at least until the wheels touched down at Newark.</span></p><p><span>Rio takes a deep breath. “You really think I can do this?”</span></p><p><span>“You really think I’d be wasting a second of my precious time with you if I didn’t?”</span></p><p><span>Rio rolls her eyes, reluctantly mumbling out, “I suppose not.”</span></p><p><span>“Then there you have it.” Agatha pulls away and squares her shoulders, satisfied and a bit smug. </span></p><p><span>She downs the rest of her champagne, catching movement in the water out of the corner of her eye as she gives her empty glass to an attendant. “Look.” She points into the distance. “A shark. Seems like a good omen. Maybe not for the people in <em>Jaws</em> — another movie I’m sure you haven’t seen — but for you, considering you’re such a <em>fin</em>-atic, pun absolutely intended.”</span></p><p><span>“Corny,” Rio accuses, though the corner of her mouth lifts into a small, amused smile. It was addictive, really — eliciting that response. Agatha had tried a lot of drugs in her day, but nothing made her feel higher than that little grin.</span></p><p><span>Rio rests her chin on Agatha’s shoulder, peering out at the sea. “I hope it wasn’t actually a dolphin you saw. They’re evil.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, yeah?” Agatha snorts. “So just like me, then.” A beat. Rio doesn’t like that, she remembers — the self-deprecating jokes about the kind of person she was, even if she was still pretty convinced it was true. “Sorry,” mutters. She shakes her head. “I mean— Flaccid. Squamous. Whatever.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gives her a little nod of approval. “They’re more like…him,” she softly muses. “They’re literally nicknamed the ‘rapists of the sea.’”</span></p><p><span>“Ah.” She awkwardly purses her lips, not quite knowing what to say. </span></p><p><span>It’s a blessing and a curse, then, that they’re distracted by the boat hitting a large wave, violently jerking everyone onboard. “Shit,” she mutters, narrowly grabbing Nicky to steady him before they’re slammed by another one. “Do you even have a fucking captain’s license?!” she yells to the front.</span></p><p><span>“Sorry, ma’am!” the man yells back. “Choppy waters!”</span></p><p><span>“I think I’m gonna be sick,” Jen whimpers, clutching onto the bench as Alice rubs her back.</span></p><p><span>“Do us all a favor and aim overboard,” Agatha tells her.</span></p><p><span>Jen shoots nauseous daggers at her, though Agatha is too busy to notice, having refocused her attention on Nicky. “You okay, baby?” she asks as she runs a hand through his hair, eyes scanning him for any sign of fear or injury.</span></p><p><span>“I’m okay.” </span></p><p><span>“You sure?”</span></p><p><span>He nods. “It felt fun. Like when you drive really, really fast over that pothole in our neighborhood, even though Mom </span><em><span>hates</span></em><span> it when you do that.”</span></p><p><span>“Oka— <em>Shit</em>,” she says again as they jolt once more, causing something to fly out of Rio’s pocket. Agatha miraculously manages to catch it, clasping it tightly in her hand. </span></p><p><span>She waits a few moments until the rocking calms and Nicky goes back to giving Lilia advice on where she should stack her next Tetris squares before daring to open it again. </span><span>“You nearly lost your—“ she says as she uncurls her fingers, revealing a giant, familiar diamond. “—wedding ring…”</span></p><p><span>“Oh.” Rio crosses her arms over her chest, self-conscious. “I was planning on burying it,” she murmurs.</span></p><p><span>Agatha holds it up between her fingers, examining it more closely. “Could probably pawn it for a pretty penny,” she muses before seeing the look on Rio’s face. “Or…” she proposes. “You could just throw it into the ocean now and wash your hands of it. It'd be very dramatic and </span><em><span>Titanic</span></em><span> of you — yes, I know you haven't seen that either.”</span></p><p><span>“I’ve seen </span><em><span>part</span></em><span> of it,” Rio defensively mumbles. “I didn’t like it.” She tilts her head in consideration. “Do you think I should?”</span></p><p><span>She narrowly resists the urge to say, ‘Absolutely the fuck yes.’ It should be solely her choice. It had to be. “I think you should if </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> want to.”</span></p><p><span>Rio chews on the inside of her cheek, pondering for a few more beats. “I think I’d rather bury it.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay.” She nods, attempting to keep any disappointment from her tone. Why hang onto it for even one more second if she wasn’t ready for a completely fresh start? Ready to move on — move on with Agatha?</span></p><p><span>Usually, she would leave it at that, let the unasked question linger and insecurity nag at her for all eternity, but fuck, she was trying to turn over a new leaf, wasn’t she? So as much as it terrifies and humiliates her, she swallows hard and says, as diplomatically as possible, “May I ask why?”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t know.” Rio squints, searching for the words. “It’s something about returning it to the earth.”</span></p><p><span>“Is the sea not part of the earth?”</span></p><p><span>“Technically. But the ocean is an abyss — it’s not the same as mud and bugs.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha runs her tongue over her teeth. That made some semblance of sense, she supposed. It was about the ritual. About having control.</span></p><p><span>“So what I’m hearing is you like things dirty,” she says, quirking a teasing brow. Perhaps she was relying on old crutches again — jokes and sex to lighten the mood — but it feels different somehow. And from the way Rio responds with an undeniably fond eye-roll, she clearly doesn’t mind.</span></p><p><span>Encouraged, Agatha leans forward to whisper in her ear. “Well, in that case, you’re in luck. I can be positively filthy.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, I’m well aware of your capabilities.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha scoffs. “Honey, you ain’t seen nothing yet.”</span></p><p><span>“Plenty to look forward to then, it seems,” Rio quips, turning her head to look at her, though her eyes shine with the kind of sincerity that always threatens to take Agatha’s breath away. They seem to say, ‘I’m looking forward to <em>everything</em> with you.’</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s smirk fades into something softer — more genuine. “Why don’t you let me hold onto this, okay?” she asks, nodding at the ring still in her hand. <em>Let me help you carry it — the whole load of your past. Trust me to handle it with care.</em></span></p><p><span>Rio gives her a small nod. “You’re not gonna…leave me, right?” she quietly checks.</span></p><p><span>“Well, you’re moving into </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> house, so…the logistics of that would be pretty complicated,” Agatha says as she slips the ring into her pocket.</span></p><p><span>She gives her a look. “You know what I mean.”</span></p><p><span>It’s absolutely absurd — the mere thought of Agatha leaving Rio instead of the other way around. Still, she appeases her. “I’m not going anywhere,” she promises her more gently. Then, before she can inevitably get too embarrassed and talk herself out of it, “You?"</span></p><p><span>She shakes her head. “Still clinging on with everything I have,” she vows, mouth twitching into a small, reassuring smile.</span></p><p><span>For some reason, Agatha believes her. She believes her with everything </span><em><span>she</span></em><span> has.</span></p><p><span>She puts an arm around Nicky’s shoulders and pulls him close, turns her hand palm-up on Rio’s leg so she can take it, play with it, do whatever she wants to do with Agatha. Agatha — independent Agatha who never gave up a single ounce of control a week ago — is game for it all.</span></p><p><span>Because Agatha — insatiable Agatha — has never felt so full. So content. So…at peace.</span></p><p><span>Disneyland. Chuck E. Cheese. Sky Zone. All cesspools crawling with pee and screaming children but all places Agatha was prepared to brave for Nicky when she’d asked him where he wanted to go during their (too-short, unfair, single) week of summer vacation together. </span></p><p><span>Sicily. He’d picked Sicily.</span></p><p><span>And thank god for that.</span></p>
