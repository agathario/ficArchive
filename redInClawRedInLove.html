<div class="userstuff">
  <p>As Rio leaves Lilia’s office, with the stack of red-slashed paper a hand high that represents her life’s work, a.k.a her not-quite-finished dissertation weighing down her bag, it starts to rain. <em>Fucking fantastic</em>, she thinks as she flips her hood up.</p><p>Her phone buzzes and she brings it out of her pocket, mindless of the rain, and reads the message with a sinking feeling in her stomach.</p><p>
  <em>I will be home late. Debrief with M</em>
</p><p>She shoves the phone back in her pocket without replying. A second later, she takes it back out, and opens her conversation with Billy. <em>can’t, have to spend the night writing</em>, she replied to his invitation to grab a beer with him, Alice, and Jen.</p><p>Right now she can’t imagine anything worse than having to stare at her laptop screen all night while Agatha is out with Margaret, and so she quickly taps out: <em>that beer still a possibility?</em></p><p> </p><p>“Wow,” Billy says, as Rio slumps down, soaking wet, into the seat across from him at the bar. Someone, probably Alice, has had the wherewithal to order for her, and so Rio grabs the beer in front of her and takes a big swig.</p><p>“If this is what almost being done with your dissertation looks like, I’m not sure I want to get there,” Billy adds, fingers tapping nervously on the coaster in front of him.</p><p>Rio buries her head in her arms, the table’s wooden surface wonderfully cool against her arms. “Take Eddie and abscond into the wilderness while you still can,” she mutters. “Save yourself.”</p><p>Someone – probably Jen – pats Rio on the head. “There, there. It’s going to be fine. You just have to…”</p><p>Rio sits back up. “If you’re about to tell me to think positive thoughts, I strongly urge you to reconsider while you still can.”</p><p>Jen holds up her hands. “Fine. Don’t come crying to me when your bad aura starts fucking up your life.”</p><p>“<em>Jen</em>,” Billy hisses at her, but Rio is too desolate to care.</p><p>Every time she thinks of her dissertation, printed out and meticulously commented by Lilia, waiting for her to fix and work through the one million little things that are still not done, that needs to be rewritten and re-thought before it’s finally finished, she wants to run away and hide somewhere in the woods and never come back. She’s so close to the finish line, but it doesn’t <em>feel</em> that way; it feels like a circle, turning upon itself, a labyrinth she will never find her way out of, the Minotaur seconds from gobbling her up.</p><p>“I hate my life,” Rio says, and takes another big drag on her beer. Even behind the bottle, she can feel the other three exchanging glances over her head. “What?”</p><p>“Is Agatha caught up in her supervising duties tonight?” Jen asks, innocently.</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean,” Rio mutters. The bottle makes a too loud sound against the table as she puts it down. “And it’s not supervising – Margaret presented her project outline at the seminar today and she and Agatha needed to ‘debrief’ afterward.”</p><p>“And you’re mad that Agatha is doing her job for once…?” Jen asks, clearly helpless not to. It’s been two years, but she has yet to warm up to Agatha.</p><p>“That’s not her job,” Rio says sourly. “If Lilia took me out for drinks every time I got some harsh feedback on my work, I would be a raging alcoholic by now.”</p><p>“Yes,” Billy says, sounding like he’s trying hard to suppress his amusement, “we are all very well aware of Margaret’s many, <em>many</em> deficiencies as doctoral student.”</p><p>“And of how boring her project is,” Jen adds. “And how much you hate her headbands.”</p><p>Rio frowns at them. “If there is something you’re trying to tell me here, Jen, just spit it out.”</p><p>She regrets it immediately when Jen says, “You’re jealous.”</p><p>Rio snorts. “Of what? Her inability to not be a complete waste of space? I just don’t like her, it’s not that deep.”</p><p>The thing is, Rio hates Margaret and have done so since she first laid eyes on her. Absolutely despises her, and her stupid dark academia vibe, with her wide, doll-like eyes, shiny, bobbed hair, and penchant for black velvet, oversized knitwear and dapper white shirts. <em>Loathes</em> her and her stupid project, on the role of witchcraft in modern esoteric movements, and the fact that she has a Sylvia Plath quote tattooed on her arm. But that doesn’t mean she’s<em> jealous</em>; it’s just an objective fact that Margaret sucks and Agatha should spend her time on more worthwhile things than coaching a glorified BookTok girl through writing a dissertation.</p><p>“I’m <em>not</em> jealous,” Rio says. “What do I have to be jealous of? I’m almost done with my dissertation and that little idiot can’t even receive feedback on a chapter without needing a ‘debrief’ and Agatha to hold her hand.”</p><p>“No, I agree,” Jen says, sitting back. “You’re really taking this with complete equilibrium. It seems that you’re dealing with it in a super-healthy, totally emotionally responsible way.”</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally Ubers back to Agatha’s place, she’s had maybe one too many beers. She’s not yet officially moved into Agatha’s apartment – not until after she gets her degree, at Agatha’s insistence – but she can’t remember the last time she spent a night in her and Billy’s – now his and Eddie’s apartment – and mostly uses her old room for storage.</p><p>When Rio stumbles in, Agatha’s already there, on the couch with a book, both cats snuggled up close. She’s still in her office clothes, but barefoot, and on her nose are the reading glasses she’s finally, with ill grace, has conceded to wearing, and something loosens in Rio’s chest at the sight of her, here, in what is, for all intents and purposes, home.</p><p>It’s been a while since they’ve had a night together – Rio’s writing crunch and Agatha’s academic responsibilities keeping their schedules separate – and despite still going to bed together at night and waking up together every single morning, Rio realizes that she, ridiculously, has missed her.</p><p>“Have you eaten?” Agatha asks as Rio collapses down on top of her with a groan. Sparky immediately jumps down from the couch with a disgruntled meow, while Rio mashes her face into Agatha’s shoulder, and nods a sloppy yes.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha brushes the hair away from Rio’s forehead.</p><p>Rio makes a muffled indeterminate noise into her collarbone, lets her fingertips slide in under Agatha’s jumper, to rest against the warm, soft flesh of her stomach.</p><p>“It’s only a couple more months, my love,” Agatha says, her hand still slowly stroking through Rio’s hair. “And then you’re done. You will get through this, because you’re fucking brilliant, okay?”</p><p>A little floaty from the beer and warmed by Agatha’s presence and her praise, Rio lets her hands wander, lured by the siren song of Agatha’s warm skin, her breasts beneath the smooth white of her jumper, the intoxicating smell at the nape of her neck.</p><p>Agatha lets Rio reach up to kiss her, but when Rio moves to deepen it, she puts her hand on Rio’s shoulder. “I’m sorry, love, but I need to get through this–” She indicates the book in her hand, “before tomorrow.” She kisses Rio’s cheek. “I’ll make it up to you, okay?”</p><p>And Rio pulls back and nods, as what little warmth Agatha’s embrace gave her quickly recedes.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio drags herself out of bed, a tad hungover and feeling a little bruised, a bit fragile, Agatha is already on her way out. She looks amazing in a long, form-fitting black dress, and the longing Rio feels for her in that moment is eclipsed only by the vague, irrational annoyance she feels at the thought of Agatha going to work and looking this good in front of Margaret of all people.</p><p>Agatha, busy with the clasp of her bracelet, smiles at Rio as she shuffles into the living room. “Hey, you.”</p><p>By rote, Rio reaches out and takes her wrist, clasps the bracelet shut for her, over the feel of Agatha’s pulse thrumming beneath her fingertips. “Morning.” She puts her hands on Agatha’s hips, leans in to drag her nose along the soft skin at the back of her neck. “You look good.”</p><p>“You should see me out of it.” Agatha grins and then makes Rio’s whole system short-circuit by taking her hand and drawing it in under her dress, letting her feel the silky edge of her stay-ups and the rippled lace of her panties. “It’s all for you, baby,” Agatha murmurs into her ear, and kisses Rio deeply, in a flash disbanding every dark, shadowy cobweb in Rio’s mind as if they were never there to begin with.</p><p> </p><p>Five cans of Monster, two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and six hours perched in front of the computer later, Rio calls it a day and heads over to her old place. She’s pretty sure she has some notes from a lecture back in the early days of her PhD that could help her flesh out parts of her literature review, if she can only find it, save her a bit of a rewrite.</p><p>She’s only been searching for a few minutes when she hears a key in the lock. “Hi, Billy!” she calls from her room – feeling it’s an 80–20 chance it’s him this early in the afternoon – when she hears the door open.</p><p>“Hi!” Billy calls back, over the rustling noise of him kicking off his sneakers. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“I’m just looking for some old lecture notes,” Rio says as Billy comes into her room. “Trying my darndest to avoid having to rewrite something I know I’ve written down somewhere. Eddie working late tonight?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Billy stretches out on Rio’s bed, and watches silently as she rifles through her chest of drawers for a minute. “Are you doing something tonight?”</p><p>“Writing,” Rio says, with a sigh. “Writing, writing, writing. I need to get through most of Lilia’s comments before Monday.” Also, hopefully, fucking her girlfriend for the first time in two weeks, but she’s not divulging that part to Billy.</p><p>Billy shifts on the bed, puts his arm behind his head. “Ah, the famous end of the tunnel,” he says. Despite his words the other night, he sounds envious – he still has a fair bit to go before he’s at the finish line.</p><p>“Yeah, well, let’s just hope it’s not a train,” Rio says distractedly, flipping through a stash of loose papers, trying to see if anything looks like what she needs.</p><p>“I think you’re going to do great,” Billy says, inadvertently echoing Agatha from last night. He frowns and shifts some more on the bed. “Ah, what<em> is</em> that?” he mutters, annoyed, and sticks his hand in under Rio’s duvet.</p><p>“What?” Rio says, still not quite listening, lost in trying to decode her own terrible handwriting.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Billy says, and at the sudden note of awe in his voice, Rio looks up.</p><p>He stares at the little black velvet box he’s pulled out from under Rio’s pillow, stashed there a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>“Oh my gods,” he repeats as he opens the lid, eyes widening as he shows it to Rio, as if she somehow would be unaware of its contents. “Oh my<em> god</em>.”</p><p>“I’m not proposing to you, if that’s what’s causing your brain to malfunction,” Rio says, snatching the box out of his hands to close it.</p><p>“Hey, no, let me see it!”</p><p>Rio hands him back the box. He looks almost reverent as he opens it, tilting it back and forth to let the ring inside catch the light.</p><p>“Wow,” he says. “I mean, it’s, like, too much, but it’s<em> so</em> Agatha.”</p><p>He’s not wrong – the stone is certainly massive. It’s black onyx, serrated by a vein of deep viridian, giving it a cold, greenish tinge in the light, set into an intricate silver band.</p><p>“I know right?” Rio says, leaning forward eagerly, suddenly happy that he’s found the box, that she can finally share this with someone. Out of all her friends, it’s Billy Agatha gets along with the best – they’ve forged a weird bond Rio doesn’t know to call parental or sibling-like, but right now she’s very glad of it. “It’s an onyx, so it’s not, like, super fancy, but it felt right.”</p><p>“Black onyx,” Billy says solemnly. “A powerful protection stone that absorbs negative energy.”</p><p>“Okay,” is all Rio, who has not quite bought into Billy and Jen’s joint fascination with crystals, says to that.</p><p>“When are you going to ask her?” Billy closes the box, puts it back under the pillow.</p><p>“After my defense,” Rio says. “But I haven’t really made a plan yet.” It’s not quite the truth; she’s made many plans, but not really settled for one. Every so often she looks over at Agatha and thinks, amazed, <em>I’m going to ask you to be my wife</em>, but exactly how she’s going to get to that moment she hasn’t figured out yet.</p><p>“Agatha Vidal,” Billy says, as if trying it out to see how it sounds. To the doubtful face Rio pulls, he adds, seriously, “Mark my words.”</p><p> </p><p>The next day Rio, needing a change of scenery, goes to the campus library to write. A decision she most bitterly regrets when she, around noon, is interrupted by someone asking, “Can I sit here?” and looks up to see Margaret, of all people, smiling down at her, a pile of books in her arms.</p><p>“Uh, sure,” Rio says, making no effort to move her stuff to make room for Margaret.</p><p>Margaret beams at her. “Great,” she says, plops down her books on one free chair and sits down on the other.</p><p>In addition to being a spawn from hell, Margaret is a prodigious networker, and she seems dead set on becoming friends with Rio. Weeks ago, she sent Rio a follow request on Instagram Rio keeps pretending she hasn’t seen. Margaret’s account is open, of course, and all she seems to do is to post aesthetically pleasing images of herself writing or selfies at lectures and symposiums, tagging in the speakers to share her thoughts of how groundbreaking and important their contributions are, to her personally and to the world.</p><p>As if that isn’t enough, she’s also <em>chatty</em>. “Whew, doing a PhD sure isn’t a joke,” she says to Rio as she unpacks her bag, puts her Macbook, Stanley cup, and an organic granola bar on the table. “I spent <em>hours</em> down in the archive yesterday, but today I’m practicing self care by making sure I get some sun in my face.”</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio says, trying desperately to indicate that she’s not interested in hearing Margaret prattle on without outright saying so.</p><p>Not picking up anything of what Rio passive aggressively is putting down, Margaret leans forward and says conspiratorially, “Do you know what the hardest part is, though?”</p><p>Rio offers no thoughts on the matter, but that doesn’t stop Margaret.</p><p>“Being professional around one’s supervisor,” Margaret says and giggles. “I mean, you’re asking me to be cool about a brilliant, older woman taking me under her wing, imparting her wisdom on me, and guiding me safely through the pitfalls of academia? Hello, I have <em>way</em> too much eldest daughter syndrome to <em>not </em>make that weird.”</p><p>“Well, I’m a middle-child myself,” Rio mutters, but that doesn’t deter Margaret either.</p><p>“Anyway,” Margaret leans in closer again. “You’ve been here a lot longer than I – I bet you know all the good gossip.”</p><p><em>Probably not as well as you</em>, Rio thinks uncharitably.</p><p>“Do you know if Agatha Harkness is into women?”</p><p>At that, Rio looks up from her computer.</p><p>Margaret laughs, seemingly oblivious. “I mean, I know what you’re going to say, starting something with your supervisor never ends well, and I get it, but she’s just so... <em>ferocious</em>, you know? God, I want her to <em>step</em> on me.”</p><p>Rio feels as if she’d had a pen in her hand, it would have snapped by now. She’s back to staring intently but unseeingly on her screen, trying to telepathically compel Margaret to please shut the fuck up.</p><p>“I think she has a girlfriend,” Rio mutters at last.</p><p>Margaret raises a well-plucked brow. “Really? Agatha? You sure about that? I haven’t really seen any signs of that, if you know what I mean,” she adds meaningfully.</p><p>Rio wants to strangle her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t planned on attending the faculty’s usual autumnal shindig – it’s always boring and she has to dress up for it – but then Agatha announces that she’s going around the same time as Lilia starts telling Rio that she really should go. “A night away from the dissertation is exactly what you need,” she says. “A party, some good conversation, a change of scenery will do you good at this point. Sometimes, the best thing to do is to let go.”</p><p>Her intentions are probably good, but what taking her advice ultimately results in is Rio sourly standing in a corner nursing a glass of horrible white wine and watches as Margaret and Agatha across the room, Margaret sidled up to Agatha and agitatedly engaging her in conversation. What’s worse is Agatha humouring her – Rio can count the number of people Agatha is nice to on the fingers of one hand, and she doesn’t like that Margaret is suddenly one of them, even if it is for work purposes.</p><p>Agatha is in a dress so deeply purple it’s almost black and leather boots, her hair loose and wild across her shoulders, and she looks so good it simultaneously makes Rio weak in the knees and inexplicably angry that she’s not the one hanging off Agatha’s arm. Usually, she’s more than happy to comply with Agatha’s wish to keep their relationship on the down low until Rio’s finished with her PhD, but tonight it makes her seethe, the idea of being consigned to the shadows while Margaret is free to steal all of Agatha’s attention out in the light.</p><p>As she watches, Agatha laughs at something Margaret says and Rio’s grip on her empty wine glass is suddenly white-knuckled.</p><p>When Agatha finally –<em> finally</em> – glances over at her, Rio catches her gaze and jerks her head towards the corridor. Without checking if Agatha has got the gist or not, she downs the rest of the terrible wine, puts her glass down, and strides towards the door.</p><p>There is a cloak room just down the hall, abandoned at this early point in the evening. Rio rounds the corner into it and only has to wait about a minute before Agatha arrives.</p><p>“Hi, baby,” Agatha smiles and leans in to kiss her sweetly, hand going up to cup Rio’s face, but that’s the opposite of what Rio is after. She kisses back viciously, backs Agatha up against the wall, and slides her tongue filthily into her mouth.</p><p>She’s already scrabbling at Agatha’s dress, pulling it up, revealing her smooth, creamy thighs. She kisses her harder, pressing her against the wall. She’s breathing heavily, keyed up, feeling unmoored, as if Agatha’s skin under her hands and her mouth against hers is the only thing keeping her tethered to reality. Fingers hook under the waistband of Agatha’s panties, pulling them down.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispers, a hint of warning in her tone.</p><p>Rio responds by dropping to her knees, looking up at Agatha. She doesn’t know what’s on her face in that moment, and it doesn’t matter because Agatha’s head falls back against the wall, hands guiding Rio’s head in between her legs, groaning as Rio’s mouth opens to worship her, tongue sliding home against Agatha’s clit, Agatha’s fingers gripping hard at her skull, and Rio feels, for the first time in days or perhaps even weeks, fully at peace.</p><p>Afterwards, as they put themselves back together, Rio’s clingy and dreamy, not ready to let go of Agatha, buries her nose into her hair with a sigh. She hasn’t come yet, and in her mind they’re already on their way home to their bed, where she will strip in front of Agatha’s attentive gaze, and then have her like that, with her fingers or maybe the strap, have Agatha straddle her, bare beneath her lovely dress, and slide into her just like that. She imagines Agatha riding her, slowly pulling down her dress as she begs Rio to play with her breasts, Agatha half-dressed and debauched above her, Agatha riding her hard, demanding another orgasm from Rio before Rio gets hers.</p><p>But instead what happens is that Agatha kisses her softly, pulls up her underwear, and says, “I’ll see you at home, okay, love?” and before Rio has a chance to reply, she’s gone, striding back to the party.</p><p> </p><p>“I think Agatha is leaving me for Margaret,” Rio proclaims, loudly, to make it carry over the thumping beat of the music, but no one seems to take her seriously. Billy and Jen laugh while Alice just gives Rio a sympathetic look.</p><p>Agatha is away on a three-day conference with Margaret in tow and Rio is handling it as well as can be expected, meaning that she writes all through the nights and spend the days in an anxiety-ridden haze, stalking Margaret on Instagram. According to her reels, she and Agatha are having the bestest time ever in Montreal and every session they attend is a revolutionary contribution to the field of women’s history, eclipsed only by what Margaret herself is bringing to the table.</p><p>Rio’s brain has officially checked out; every time she lets her thoughts wander, she ends up thinking about Margaret and Agatha fucking across every conceivable surface in the hotel. She knows she’s being insane, but she can’t help it, and her only recourse now is to get spectacularly drunk, tagging along with Billy, Jen, and Alice to a club. The music is shit (“You <em>always </em>say that,” Billy protests) and the drinks are worse, but it gets the job done.</p><p>“I’m not thinking about Agatha at all!” she shouts into the air on the dance floor, letting Billy spin her round in a circle, and they all laugh. Four shots in, she can barely remember what it was that had her so bent out of shape.</p><p><em>I hope you have fun at the conference xoxo</em>, she texts Agatha an hour later. Fifteen minutes later she sends her a group photo.</p><p>“God, I love Agatha,” she sighs dreamily into Billy’s shoulder as they step out for a smoke, leaning heavily against him against the roiling of the world beneath her feet. She sends Agatha another text to that effect before they head back inside for another round of drinks.</p><p>By 2 AM she’s so drunk she can hardly stand, but she doesn’t have to: the nice girl she fell into on the dance floor is happy to hold her up, pressing Rio against the wall as they kiss.</p><p>By the time the club closes, Rio has come full circle and is back to her state of morose despair, sick with the realization that she has <em>made out with another woman</em>.</p><p>“She will never come back,” she says later, miserably, to the night. She doesn’t know where the others have disappeared off to; she only knows that she’s all alone in a cold and uncaring universe and that she needs to <em>fix</em> this somehow. She thinks about calling Agatha to explain, make her take her back, but she’s a bit unsure about where she’s put her phone.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio wakes, she feels like she’s died and put back together wrong. She’s completely disoriented, but when she finally manages to unglue her eyelids, open her eyes, and brush her hair from her face, she realizes that she’s at home, in her and Agatha’s bed, the clock on the bedside table informing her that it’s three in the afternoon.</p><p>“Fucking hell,” Rio groans. Her mouth tastes like a swamp and her head throbs viciously. With another groan, she very laboriously rolls over, only to feel a sharp, shallow pain lace through her left side. “What the fuck.”</p><p>It takes a heroic effort to sit up, but at last she manages it. Gingerly, she lifts the hem of her t-shirt – the same as last night – and pulls it up to reveal a square of plastic, gummy and opaque with black ink, taped to her ribs.</p><p>Suddenly, an image from last night flashes vividly in her mind, accompanied by a low buzzing sound, and she hears herself say, surprisingly clearly for the state she’d apparently been in, “It’s A-G-A-T-H-A – with an H.”</p><p>She stares down at the plastic, nausea building inside her like a horrible, unrelenting tsunami of crap. “Oh, no,” she says. “Oh <em>fuck</em> no.”</p>

  <p>The conference is, as usual, a test of Agatha’s patience, straining her ability to stand other people for an extended period of time to the outmost. It’s not as bad as it could have been – the venue’s nice, the people less than terribly annoying, Margaret did well enough during her paper presentation, and Agatha’s own session went off without a hitch.</p><p>She ducks out of the seminar room afterward and calls Rio. She answers on the third ring, sounding tired and distracted.</p><p>Agatha remembers well the horror that was the last months of finishing her PhD, and she does her best to rally Rio, but between setting up her new research project and looking after her new PhD candidate she knows that she hasn’t been as supportive as she could have been. On the other hand, writing a dissertation is, after all, by design a rather lonely endeavor and there is nothing much she can do beside coach Rio through it.</p><p>“I don’t think you need to rearrange your methods section,” she tells Rio now. “It’s damn good already, and you know I’m not nice enough to lie about it if it wasn’t true.”</p><p>Rio laughs at that, at least. “I guess.” She sighs.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha says. “I’m home by tomorrow evening, okay? Just put up some straightforward writing goals, make sure you hit them, and then take a rest, yeah?”</p><p>“You know,” Rio says, sounding sly, which makes Agatha relax minutely – if she’s making jokes, she’s probably going to be alright, “I would be more inclined to make use of your writing strategies if I ever saw you utilize them yourself, instead of always burning the midnight oil right before a deadline.”</p><p>“Watch it – I’m very graciously offering you the chance to learn from my mistakes here,” Agatha says. She glances over her shoulder and catches sight of Margaret heading her way. “I need to go, but I love you and see you soon, okay?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio sighs again. “See you and I love you.”</p><p> </p><p>By five the conference is officially wrapped up but Agatha’s staying until Saturday afternoon in order to get some early Christmas shopping done before heading home to Boston. So is Margaret and a rather large group of other attendees, taking advantage of the work trip to get some R&amp;R.</p><p>They convene in the hotel lobby for drinks. Agatha is mostly attending for Margaret’s sake, who needs to build her network and connect with other researchers in the field, but she ends up with a group of women who attended her session, asking about her research, and it’s surprisingly nice.</p><p>Margaret keeps coming back to hover at Agatha’s side, despite the many people Agatha introduces her to in order to help her make important connections. She does tend to trail after Agatha like a little puppy, but Agatha guesses that comes with the territory. She’s whip smart, has great potential, and is very willing to learn from Agatha – as good a combination as one gets in a PhD candidate, in Agatha’s opinion. And she knows, from experience, that it’s better to put in a lot of time early, to prime the candidate for what writing a dissertation really entails and steadily build up the skills needed to pull it off from the get-go, rather than just throw them in and see if they sink or swim and then try to salvage the resulting wreckage.</p><p>They eat in the hotel restaurant and have a few more drinks and when Agatha looks at her phone the next time, it’s suddenly past ten.</p><p>There is a text from Rio: <em>hopes you’vehaving fun at th conference xoxo</em>. Fifteen minutes later, a blurry photo of a quarter of Rio’s face and what Agatha thinks are parts of Billy and Jen’s respective torsos on a dance floor arrives. <em>were having fun hear</em>, Rio adds, apparently drunk out of her mind. Agatha responds with a heart.</p><p>An hour later, when Agatha is heading up to her room, Rio writes: <em>love u and miss u so mulch :(((((((((</em> Smiling, Agatha taps out a reply – <em>Miss you too, baby</em> – as she climbs the stairs. When she’s back in her room she thinks about calling Rio, telling her goodnight, but judging by the evening’s correspondence, Rio is in a club somewhere having fun, and so Agatha only writes, <em>Goodnight, love</em>, before rolling over and going to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>When she wakes, she has two missed calls, one voice message, and ten text messages from Rio. The voice message is just eight seconds of some godawful thumping music. Agatha immediately deletes it and opens the text chain instead.</p><p>
  <em>wish u we here </em>
</p><p><em>billy got us </em>🔥 <em>shots!</em></p><p>
  <em>have decided nOT do finish PhD, to buy having fun insteadd</em>
</p><p>
  <em>if u really want to fuck M i can totally handle an open relationshipb may bee</em>
</p><p>
  <em>terribly personality tho</em>
</p><p>☠️ ☠️ ☠️</p><p><em>peas don’t fuck her :((((((((( </em>😭</p><p>
  <em>the musicc really ice shit</em>
</p><p>
  <em>having an open relate is horribly i don’t want kiss other womans!!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>ughh so uruk-hai </em>
</p><p>Agatha immediately presses Call on Rio’s number, and despite waiting, impatiently, nails clacking against the phone cover, as signal after signal sounds, no one picks up and the call eventually disconnects. She tries again, with the same result. <em>Rio, love, call me when you see this okay?</em> she writes.</p><p>What the hell happened last night?</p><p>She calls Billy, brusquely ripping him out of his much needed beauty sleep judging by the loud groan and the croaked “H’lo?” he opens with.</p><p>“Do you know where Rio is?” she demands, without bothering with a hello in return. “She sent some strange texts last night and now she won’t answer her phone.” <em>I’m worried about her</em>, she doesn’t say, only bites her lip instead.</p><p>“Uh...” She hears a sound as if Billy is scrubbing a hand over his face, a low voice, probably Eddie, in the background asking what’s happening. If he had been in front of her, she would have shaken him.</p><p>“Um,” Billy tries again. “We were at this club, having a bit to drink...”</p><p>“Clearly,” Agatha says.</p><p>“And then we, uh, danced, I think. Rio was having fun, it seemed, but she was a little out of it, you know spiraling about the Margaret thing as usual.”</p><p>“What Margaret thing?” Agatha asks. On the other side of the line, Billy goes silent.</p><p>“What.” Her grip on the phone tightens, the tendril of worry that has been slithering inside her since waking to Rio’s barrage of drunken texts suddenly multiplying.</p><p>“Uh...”</p><p>“Billy, tell me – <em>what Margaret thing</em>?”</p><p>Billy sighs. “Well, she has this weird jealousy thing going on about Margaret, about how much time, uh, you spend with her. It’s not, like, a big thing,” he hastens to add. “We all assumed it was just dissertation nerves.”</p><p>“Billy,” Agatha gets out through clenched teeth, “who’s ‘we’?”</p><p>“Uh, me, Jen, and Alice,” he says. “Um, we assumed you had noticed?”</p><p>“Thank you, Billy,” Agatha says stiffly before hanging up and throwing her phone onto the bed.</p><p> </p><p>She rebooks her flight. She sends a text to that effect, first to Rio and then to Margaret, before packing up her stuff and heading to the airport. In all probability, Rio is fine, at home sleeping off the night before with her phone on silent, but Agatha just wants to go and see for herself. She is uselessly annoyed at Rio for spending the last two years telling Agatha how bad she is at communicating and being in tune with her feelings, only to turn around and go on a jealousy spiral about Agatha’s <em>PhD student</em>, of all things, without saying a word.</p><p>Two and a half hours later, she sets down in Boston. She only has a carry-on with her, and getting off and into a cab is a surprisingly quick and painless operation. In the car, she takes out her phone again, but there is still no word from Rio.</p><p>She hasn’t quite realized how worried she really is about Rio possibly being lost somewhere until she comes through the door and stumbles over Rio’s boots, thrown haphazardly in front of the threshold, and feels only relief.</p><p>For the most part, Rio is the level part of their relationship, but when she does get her feelings hurt, she tends to behave like a wounded animal, drawing away to lick her wounds in peace – until she gets drunk and ends her self-imposed exile in the most dramatic fashion possible.</p><p>When Agatha opens the bedroom door, Rio is there, safely, deeply asleep in their bed, the room smelling as if she’s sweating off a gallon of vodka. There’s three darkened glowstick put together into a necklace around her throat, the pillow-case is smudged with black make-up she hasn’t washed off, and while her jeans and two socks all are thrown in a different corner of the room.</p><p>Despite the late hour, she doesn’t so much as stir by Agatha’s presence. Quietly backing away, Agatha gently closes the door and goes to inventory the kitchen in search of food.</p><p> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, there is nothing much to eat in the kitchen besides Monster and sandwiches and so Agatha leaves to stock up on some bacon, eggs, fresh pasta and vegetables. When she returns about an hour later, Rio is up – the bathroom door is closed, and she can hear the shower running at full speed.</p><p>She has time to put the groceries away and two thirds through the making of a fluffy spinach omelet when the shower finally shuts off.</p><p>After another few minutes, Rio comes out, dressed in Agatha’s purple robe, toweling her hair. It takes her a moment to catch sight of Agatha, and when she does, she starts, eyes going wide and hand going up to clutch at her chest as if Agatha is a robber who has broken into her house or something.</p><p>“What…?” Even after a shower, she looks like shit, with dark circles under her eyes and her face pale and drawn, looking around in confusion as if she suspects that Agatha’s presence suggests some form of practical joke. “I thought you weren’t supposed to be home until ten tonight?”</p><p>“I took an earlier flight.” Effortlessly, Agatha slides the omelet onto a plate. She puts it on the table. “Here.”</p><p>Looking like she’s working on autopilot only, her eyes not leaving Agatha, Rio shuffles towards the table and sits down while Agatha busies herself with making a pot of tea. “Judging by the chain of texts you sent me last night, I had expected you to be happy to see me,” she says over her shoulder.</p><p>“I…” Rio trails off. Her mouth makes a dry, clicking noise as she swallows. “Agatha…”</p><p>“Hey, it’s fine.” Agatha puts the teapot on the table, along with two mugs, and bends to kiss Rio on the forehead. “I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”</p><p>Rio squeezes her eyes shut.</p><p>To be fair, she doesn’t look okay at all, Agatha thinks. She’s clearly hungover to hell, but there is something more than that. She’s white and trembling, withdrawn – she seems almost afraid to meet Agatha’s gaze straight on, looking like she’s carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.</p><p><em>It’s going to be fine</em>, Agatha would tell her if she thought she would be capable of listening to sound advice right now. <em>You will get the dissertation done and everything will feel better</em>.</p><p>She sits down opposite Rio. Pouring the tea, she pushes one of the mugs towards Rio, grabs the other one for herself. Rio still hasn’t touched the omelet.</p><p>“You know you’ll feel better,” Agatha says, nodding towards the plate.</p><p>Rio pitches forward, onto her elbows, and buries her face in her hands. “I have to tell you something.”</p><p>It’s muffled by her palms, and it takes Agatha a second to decipher it. She pauses, the mug of tea inches from her mouth. She puts it down, reaches across the table to clasp her hand around Rio’s arm, says softly, “Hey, it’s okay, love.”</p><p>A sliver opens between Rio’s palms, one eye peeking out to look up at Agatha.</p><p>“Billy told me,” Agatha says, slowly stroking her thumb along Rio’s arm. “About the Margaret thing. I don’t care that you got jealous. You’re in the worst period of your academic career right now – no one can blame you for being a bit stupid and irrational.”</p><p>The gap in Rio’s hands closes again and she groans pitifully. “Oh, <em>god</em>.”</p><p>“Is this about the texts offering me an open relationship?” Agatha asks, half as a joke, but Rio freezes.</p><p>“What,” she asks finally, removing her hands from her face. “I’ve no idea what I sent you last night, I lost my phone.”</p><p>Agatha unlocks her phone, slides it over to let Rio read through their conversation.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio groans again as she finishes reading the last one.</p><p>“It was very generous of you,” Agatha says dryly, taking back the phone. “But, as surprising as it may seem to you, I’m not really looking for permission to fuck my doctoral student.”</p><p>Rio still isn’t looking at her, and the omelet and the tea are growing cold in front of her, untouched.</p><p>Agatha swallows down her vague irritation at Rio’s ceaseless pity party, and tries anew. “Rio…”</p><p>“I kissed someone.” Rio pokes at a hangnail, starts to pull at it, as the words hang between them.</p><p>It seems as if they carry an echo, repeating in the sudden silence of the kitchen. <em>I kissed someone</em>.</p><p>“I think. At the club. I don’t know who, I was completely wasted. <em>Fuck</em>.” Rio draws blood, which pools dark and red along her cuticle in the shape of a half-moon. She puts the finger into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha, dumbstruck, gazes at her, the defeated slump of her shoulders, the bruised-looking violet circles under her eyes, the pained set of her mouth. It feels like she is in one of those movie scenes, in which you hear a shot go off and the world suddenly stops for a few seconds before the blood starts pouring, the hurt sets in, and someone crumbles to the floor.</p><p>She takes it in, objectively, the fact that her girlfriend has kissed another woman, turns it over and over in her mind – <em>Rio has kissed another woman</em> – and waits for the inevitable wave of hurt and anger to begin to crest inside her. She hears her mother’s voice resounding in her mind: <em>No one will ever love you</em>.</p><p>In a sudden flash of movement, Rio scrambles for Agatha’s hand, braids their fingers together and squeezes, hard. “I’m sorry, okay? Agatha, I’m <em>so</em> sorry. I know it’s not an excuse, but I was out of my mind, thinking about Margaret and you and the stupid dissertation and I was so drunk and – and…” She trails off, bends her head. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Agatha waits and waits, for the pain to set in, for the heavy knowledge of the fact that she’s impossible to love and that this finally proves it to settle in over her. But it doesn’t – there <em>is</em> anger and hurt there somewhere, but it doesn’t engulf her. It stings, but it doesn’t immolate her.</p><p>She thinks of all the things that hovered on the outskirts of her mind as she rebooked her flight and dashed home, the barely-formulated mass of images of Rio wounded – or worse – playing on loop somewhere in the back of her brain, and in some strange way this is a relief, something that can be fixed.</p><p>“Please,” Rio says, her grip clammy against Agatha’s hand. “I understand if you hate me, if you want to break up… I can clear out my stuff–”</p><p>Something scrabbles, panic-ridden, against Agatha’s insides at that thought, and, looking it straight in the eye, she thinks, <em>Okay then</em>.</p><p>“Hey,” she says, very softly, reaching over to touch Rio’s downturned cheek, waits for her to finally meet her eyes. “You’re such an idiot, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio laughs, or sobs, and then she at last picks up the fork and starts in on the cold omelet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had expected that to be more or less the end of it. They tread carefully around one another for a while, both of them feeling fragile and unsure, as if they need to re-orient themselves around this new territory of their relationship, so it takes a while for Agatha to realize that Rio is avoiding her.</p><p>They haven’t had sex since before Agatha went away to Montreal, and at first, it’s nothing strange: Agatha isn’t really in the mood and Rio is writing like a woman possessed, spending long days at the library and coming home only to immediately collapse into bed.</p><p>Then her deadline passes, and she sleeps for a full ten hours and seems to emerge on the other side a bit more alive. But every time the kisses between them turn too deep or Agatha tries to get Rio to touch her, or makes a meaningful comment, Rio pulls away, carefully but also with that look on her face – like a deer in headlights.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t bring it up, at first. She remembers well how fucked up she was in the months after finishing her dissertation, not sleeping more than a few hours every night and more or less vibrating out of her skin with some sort of bizarre burst of energy scraped from the bottom of her burnt-out brain, while at the same time feeling like she could take on the world. She and Rebecca had fought more or less every day during that time – something that maybe should have clued them in to the fact that they should have broken up sooner rather than later.</p><p>She tries to give Rio some time to acclimatize to this new reality in which she has absolutely nothing to do, and there is nothing she<em> can</em> do until her defense, but it doesn’t seem like Rio is about to settle down anytime soon. She’s restless, searching out stuff to clean or fix in the apartment – exchanges the light bulb in a corner lamp who has been off for a month, dusts and reorganizes their bookcases, vacuums behind the couch, cleans the fridge, and defrosts the freezer.</p><p>More than that, she seems rattled; she moves nervously around Agatha, as if Agatha is a bomb about to go off, sending her long, sad glances, and suddenly it’s been two weeks and Agatha is growing paranoid wondering why Rio doesn’t want to touch her, keeps her distance to the extent that she’s started to sleep with a t-shirt on instead of in the nude like she have been doing for two years. </p><p>Like a rubber band stretched out and suddenly snapping back, she wonders one afternoon at work if Rio told her the truth about that night at the club, or if something else happened, if she went home with that girl, if she’s being eaten up by guilt inside, and that’s why she’s acting so weird.</p><p>Never one to resist her worst impulses, she throws her laptop into her bag and heads home at that thought, the righteous fury building inside her for every step of the way, until she rushes through the door immediately bursts out with, “Tell me what’s going on right now, or this ends right here.”</p><p>“What?” Rio calls, unsatisfactorily enough, from the direction of the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha finds her on her knees in front of the wash basin, in a pair of worn jeans and a black tank top, her hair pulled back into a ponytail, doing something utterly incomprehensible to the pipe running below it, the muscles in her back and upper arms shifting under the mass of black and grey ink.</p><p>“I’m just clearing the…”</p><p>“Did you fuck her?” Agatha’s breathing is loud in the cramped room. “Is that why you’ve been so weird?” <em>Is that why you won’t fuck me?</em></p><p>Rio looks up at her, eyes wide. “No,” she says, but it comes out guiltily.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“No!” Rio repeats vehemently. “I didn’t, I swear.”</p><p>“Then<em> why</em>?” Agatha asks, aggrieved.  “What is <em>up</em> with you?”</p><p>Rio turns back to the basin, starts screwing some part or another back in place. She rises to her feet and washes off her hands.</p><p>She turns back to Agatha, still with that stupid deer in the headlights look on her face. She suddenly looks very young, and very scared.</p><p>“Don’t be mad,” she says, looking beseechingly up at Agatha, and Agatha swings between annoyance and complete incomprehension like a lunatic metronome at that inane look on her face.</p><p>“If you didn’t fuck her, how bad can it possibly be?” she asks brusquely.</p><p>Rio sighs, before she grabs the hem of the tank top, pulls it up over her ribs and twists so that Agatha can catch sight of her left side.</p><p>There, across Rio’s ribs, running in a semi-circle right below her breast, is a newly made tattoo, shining from translucent cream, stark against Rio’s pale skin. In the heavy, flowy kind of script Agatha has come to associate with Rio’s tattoos it says: <em>Agatha</em>. The uppermost layer of it is peeling away, like sunburnt skin, but in black flakes instead of white.</p><p>Agatha stares. And stares some more. She realizes, from far away, that she’s warm, something fervent slowly expanding inside of her, the air between them in the bathroom suddenly thick with tension.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio says, pleadingly, and Agatha looks up at her, at her nervous face, and blinks.</p><p>Stepping forward, she places her palm over Rio’s ribs, right below the tattoo, thumb catching on the sticky edge of the ointment. Distantly, she realizes that she’s not wet, exactly, but certainly on her way there.</p><p>She licks her lips. Rio’s gaze tracks the movement, her eyes growing dark.</p><p>“Agatha,” she says again, on an exhale, as if she’s releasing some dark and terrible weight that’s she’s been carrying.</p><p>Without taking her eyes off the tattoo, Agatha tells her, very seriously, “I need you to fuck me. Right now,” and Rio doesn’t laugh or make light of it, only nods, equally seriously, desperately, and pulls Agatha in to kiss her.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p>After Rio’s defense – which she passed, with flying colors (“I told you so,” Agatha says, but only once) – Agatha rents them a cabin somewhere for a few days. ‘Cabin’ is the word she uses; when they get there, Rio realizes that she and Agatha apparently have very different definitions of the term.</p><p>“Do I want to know what this cost?” Rio mutters under her breath. There is a bearskin rug in front of the fireplace she really hopes is fake, but suspects is not.</p><p>Agatha comes up behind her, wraps her arms around her. “What else do I have to spend money on except spoiling you?” she asks, kissing the back of her neck.</p><p>It turns out that it’s a justified expense, after all, because they don’t really leave the cabin, spending most of their vacation in bed. And, once, at Rio’s insistence, on the bearskin rug. She has the idea that it will be hot, Agatha spread out all over it, but instead it mostly just stresses her out, the fear that they will leave sticky marks all over it, and when she suggests laying down a towel, Agatha vetoes the whole thing, and they move it to the bed.</p><p>On the last night, Agatha wants to ride her, Rio flat on her back as Agatha straddles her. She knows what it does to Rio, how it leaves her absolutely dumbstruck watching her like this, and she puts on a bit of a show, rises up to her knees and grabs the strap with her hand, uses it to rub against her, moaning and writhing, Rio’s gaze flipping obsessively between her wet, pink cunt and her breasts bobbing invitingly in front of her face.</p><p>Before she can do anything about it, however, Agatha sinks down on the toy, mouth opening and brow furrowing with pleasure as she takes it inside her. She sits down on it, shifting a little to find the right angle, moans as she slots it perfectly inside her.</p><p>Rio rises up on her elbows, to get within reach of Agatha’s mouth, her insane, enthralling breasts, the soft slope of her waist, but Agatha pushes her back down with a firm hand on her chest. She rocks experimentally, finds her rhythm, and starts fucking herself on Rio.</p><p>It starts out slow, but builds quickly, Agatha’s loud pants are soon filling the air as she rides Rio fast and hard. Eyes heavy lidded and collarbones shining with sweat, she takes her pleasure with razor-edged desperation, rolling her hips faster and faster, breathing hard. And Rio is right there with her, panting into the silence, torn between wanting to grab hold of Agatha’s hips and fuck up into her, make her scream, and just watching as Agatha uses Rio for her pleasure, just takes what she wants from her with total, beautiful abandon.</p><p>Agatha’s palm still presses heavy against Rio’s chest, her eyes fastened on the ink there on her ribs, at her name imprinted on Rio, inked indelibly beneath her skin. It should be ridiculous how much it turns her on, how much Agatha absolutely, obsessively loves that stupid, ill-conceived tattoo, but it’s not, Rio loves that she loves it, loves the narcissistic, wildfire joy Agatha seems to take in it.</p><p>Agatha’s tempo slows a little, a sure sign that she’s feeling a little overwhelmed. “Oh god, oh fuck,” she chants quietly, and Rio sees her opening, catches Agatha’s hips in her hands and rolls them over, barely gives Agatha a second to regroup before she spreads her legs and pushes inside her again.</p><p>“Yes, yes, <em>YES</em>,” Agatha moans, still in that same, chanting tone. “Harder, <em>god</em> – fuck me harder, baby, I love you so much, you feel so good, I love you, baby, god, please <em>marry me</em>–”</p><p>She comes, and it’s like an avalanche, fast and forceful, Agatha’s whole body seizing up and trembling for a small eternity, before she finally relaxes in Rio’s holds, falls back to the bed.</p><p>“Oh, fuck you,” Rio says as she pulls out. She unsnaps the harness, pulls it off, before reaching over to open the night table on her side of the bed, where the little black box has been sitting, burning a hole in her mind, for three days.</p><p>The box lands in the middle of Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Fuck you,” Rio tells her again, rolls up right beside her anew, buries her face into the nape of her neck, breathes in the combined scent of Agatha and sex and <em>them</em>, arm coming up to rest across Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha starts reaching for the box, but Rio changes her mind.</p><p>“Ugh, no,” she says and grabs the box away from Agatha. “I had a <em>plan</em>, Agatha. It was very well thought through, <em>very</em> romantic, and then you just<em> had</em> to go and ruin it…”</p><p>Agatha tries to get the box back and they squabble over it like children, until she manages to get it open. But Rio steals the ring right out of it, grabs Agatha’s left hand, and quickly shoves it on Agatha’s finger.</p><p>“There,” she says, disgruntled. “I can’t believe you got both the ring <em>and</em> the proposal.”</p><p>Agatha says nothing, just gazes down at the ring, looking very satisfied.</p><p>Rio shifts closer to her, tangles their legs together. “You owe me a tattoo of my <em>face</em>, Agatha. On <em>your</em> face.” She puts her head on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha holds out her hand before them, the ridiculous stone catching the light, giving off a green sheen. “It’s really beautiful,” she says, free hand curving around Rio’s skull as she bends down to kiss her temple.</p><p>“I <em>know</em>,” Rio says. “Unlike for <em>some</em>, it wasn’t a spur of the moment thing. I had a<em> whole</em> plan.”</p><p>“Hardly a watertight one, it seems,” Agatha says, unapologetically, as she turns her hand every which way to look at the ring from all angles.</p><p>“You’re taking my name,” Rio tells her, mock-seriously, into her throat, presses a kiss there, and almost falls off the bed in shock when Agatha immediately says, “Okay.”</p>
