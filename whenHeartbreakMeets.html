     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      “Well, not all of us take a job offer and skip town, better yet moves across the country, without a single goodbye”
     </p>
     <p>
      The younger woman snickered over Agatha’s words. A low laugh hidden behind the beer that brushed against her lips.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Oh! So, it’s a joke to you?” Agatha perked up in her seat.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Agatha..” Lilia muttered a warning for her to settle down, but that was impossible.
     </p>
     <p>
      “No! No, clearly Rio here doesn’t care about what she did-”
     </p>
     <p>
      “There it is,” Rio muttered under her breath.
     </p>
     <p>
      “What?”
     </p>
     <p>
      “The jealousy,” Rio cleared her throat, lowering the beer to let Agatha see her face bright with glory. “You can’t stand I received a job offer with pay you couldn’t dream of”
     </p>
     <p>
      No..it’s that you never said goodbye to me..
     </p>
     <p>
      ____
     </p>
     <p>
      Rio moved across the country for the job of a lifetime, said goodbye to all her friends- Except, Agatha. Now forced to see each other for a two week trip after a year apart, heartbreak meets jealousy and safe to say? Two weeks would be life threatening to them all. Especially with Rio's new girlfriend in tow. An AU.

    <blockquote>
     <p>
      If there's any typos, just keep in mind I've stared at this for days now. My eyes may have blended it all by the end if that makes sense LMAO. But, this was supposed to really only be jealousy and then exploded into massive heartbreak and emotional pain as well so...tissues suggested if you're sensitive to this shit lol.

      Mother Gothel: No party. I’m serious, Nicholas.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Annoying Child: I thought you said I could have a bonfire with my friends this weekend!
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Mother Gothel: Not a BONFIRE, a regular fire. In our tiny fire pit. I don’t want a call you’re in fucking handcuffs for setting off the neighborhood.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Mother Gothel: Be thankful I’m even giving you that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Mother Gothel: Keep the hose near you.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Mother Gothel: And if you go behind my back, you have two weeks to fix whatever mess you create to save your life. I brought you into this world, I can fucking take you right back out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Annoying Child: I’d come back to life to haunt you and make your life hell
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Would you give that boy a break?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia chuckled as she climbed into the van, taking the seat in front of Agatha who was hidden, tucked away, in the back corner.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had kept her greetings short to focus on letting her son know she made it. Storming off to call him at first, tell him off for the new contact name he gave her (Even if she secretly adored it). She had been so focused on that, Agatha completely forgot to make sure he would be safe and nag him with reminders.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was Lilia’s idea for them to go on a two week trip. A lead up to (The long overdue) Alice’s and Jen’s wedding. They chose the city since the college where they met wasn’t far from it. Typically, Agatha wouldn’t mind. However, this was her first trip, agreeing to leave her son home alone. Not like he would entirely be alone, logically she knew that. With his best friend living next door, Agatha had grown close to Billy’s mother- Wanda. She trusted her to look after him, but still gave the teenager subtle freedom.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With her worries already being heightened over the trip, having him home alone didn’t help. Even if Lilia was the one to stress it was time to let go of the reins a bit. Agatha tried to be a relaxed mother, but ultimately she had earned the nickname “Mother Gothel” from all her friends including Nicholas.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Mom, you love warm weather,” Nicky pointed out. “And, you can’t miss the wedding!”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha smirked, taking a sip from her wine as she watched the presentation he had up. Secretly, it was already decided. Lilia had bought the plane ticket for her, spoke to Wanda behind her back, and promised if anything went wrong- Agatha had full permission to dig her grave.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Though, Nicholas was adamant to prove his case. He wanted to convince Mother Gothel to go for a small vacation, attend the wedding. Which Nicky was very happy to be out of. No kids allowed and Nicky stressed that included teenagers. He loved Jen and Alice, but was far more ecstatic for Agatha to trust him with being alone more than just a day.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Plus!” He clicked on his computer, the next slide came up that sliced every inch of Agatha to pieces.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       She kept her composure (Well, the best she could) at the familiar photo. Rio was holding a toddler aged Nicholas on her hip, Agatha beside her, all three with wide smiles as they stood in front of the zoo’s welcome sign. Another sip of wine, longer than the ones before.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Fuck.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha remembered that day vividly. Hell, she remembered everything including Rio more than any part of Agatha’s own life without her.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       The two were inseparable since the day they met. When Nicky was born, Rio insisted she’d be by her side every step of the way. People would joke she was like the boy’s father, but Agatha would constantly remind everyone Rio was only a good friend. Nothing more, nothing less.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       A friend she had hopelessly fallen in love with and ached for daily since she left.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “You get to see Rio!”
      </span>

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       She faked a small smile, desperate to keep the charade going. Nicholas had no idea Rio and she didn’t speak anymore. It was her demand for him to never know. That boy adored Rio and Agatha no matter what wasn’t going to risk anything for their relationship to be ripped away.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “I’m so jealous. After this, can I fly out on my own and-”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha belted out a laugh, finishing off the glass of wine as she got up to get herself a refill. Maybe the bottle. She’d decide as her mind raced back to Rio. A location in her head Agatha always resisted to visit.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Hell no, that is out of the question” She pointed. “You’re lucky I’m agreeing to let you be home by yourself while I’m-”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Nicky nearly jumped over the coffee table to tackle her in a hug. His arms wrapped around from her side, squeezing tight as he spilled a mess of thank you’s and how he’d show her everything would work out.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       She sighed, freeing her one arm to wrap around him, pressing a kiss on the top of his head.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “I’ll go start my next presentation for the flight-”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha pressed her hand on his head, pushing him off with a subtle glare.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Don’t worry about that. The deadline for that presentation is in your grave”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       He groaned, but cut the reaction off to make sure Agatha didn’t change her mind.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Just gives me more time to make it convincing, Mother Gothe-”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “One more word and I will cancel my trip so fast or send you to some fucking camp for annoying children”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And so, before Agatha knew it she had her bags packed and found herself on the plane, touching down last after the rest. The moment she stepped foot on the sidewalk, warm air graced her skin, hearing her friends cheer for her to join them. The thought hit her like a thousand knives at once.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wasn’t just in Los Angeles. No. Agatha had entered the lion's den, her enemy’s turf. Aka, Rio Vidal territory.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen said Rio was supposed to join, but work had gotten in the way and she wasn’t able to make it. That had been told to her right as she was about to decline, saying she’d see them at the wedding.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Was it a tactic to get her to go? Most likely. Agatha wasn’t stupid after all. And she knew Jen for what? Close to twenty years now? She didn’t allow herself to think about the time she knew her friends. Age was something that felt disgusting and daunting at once.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She’d be forty years old by the end of the year and that- Oh, Agatha didn’t acknowledge it. Nearly forty, still stuck in love with the woman she fell for so long ago. The universe hated her, Agatha would place all her life savings on that bet.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was twenty one when nineteen year old Rio stumbled into her life. Since the moment their eyes met, that little smirk made her heart skip a beat, her world had never been the same.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman was Alice’s co-worker at the old cafe they worked at. Both barista’s that were too good to be underpaid. The two were introduced to one another over dinner one night and Unbeknownst to them? Their friends watched closely, secretly betting on when the friendship slipped into something more. However, nothing became more than platonic.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They had a small drunken hook up when Agatha was twenty three, but both laughed it off and never acknowledged it again. Not even their friends knew it had happened. It was so quick, swept under the rug before it ever was above it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That hook up, the drunken night when all the liquor was coursing through her veins- Agatha lied when she agreed with Rio over forgetting what happened. Rio claimed she blacked out and didn't have a single memory of it. Whether that was true or not, Agatha didn’t want to know.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The thought, reminder of the memory, still haunted her. When she had her fingers buried deep, eyes locked above studying every feature of the best friend she had always found beautiful. Though it was as Rio’s back arched off the bed, a high pitched moan screamed her name. Those few seconds, that exact moment-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha Harkness knew for the first time in her young life, she was in love.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The realization was a punch in the chest. She felt the world crush on her shoulders, threatening to kill and swallow her whole. After they laughed it off, Rio walked out of her room to leave the older woman and Agatha fell into a devastating wreck.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wasn’t seen for days, too busy picking up extra hours at work or hiding under the heavy bed sheets. Agatha hoped some nights unintentionally starving herself would be her savior. Maybe she’d go to sleep to never wake up. Maybe this was just a coma from a car wreck or God knows what.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Whatever the tragedy would be, nothing compared to falling in love with her best friend who would never feel the same.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Safe to say? Being in the woman’s city, the place she ran off to after accepting the job offer that changed her life. Agatha was happy when she heard the news. Well, as happy as she could be with the idea of Rio across the country from her. Though the job was everything Rio strived for and dreamt about. Agatha

      However, that changed when she found out Rio had left without a goodbye.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      All their friends had a beautiful, emotional, farewell from her. They had talked about it endlessly until one night, Agatha snapped when reality set in, replacing the shock that had been taking the front seat to protect every emotion within her.

       Agatha’s voice was short, a temper on the verge of exploding into rage that’d send shockwaves over the globe. They had brought it up countless times since Rio had left. This wasn’t brand new information, but it was the first time Agatha let herself say the truth out loud.

       Agatha was never one to cry in front of others. She always wore a tough front. Even if her friends knew she was vulnerable on the inside, it was known for Agatha to never share a sliver of it. Only Rio, maybe Lilia, had seen the more emotional, theatrical side of her.

       Jen and Alice’s surprise reacted in sync with one another. Their eyes widened with the short gasp, feeling as if they were on the verge of a war. An attack Agatha would lash out, not meaning to hit the wrong targets (Rio should be the target, but the three knew this was it. Agatha may never speak to their friend again).

       Agatha shot up from the chair, grabbing her jacket and storming out of the apartment. A few photos fell and shattered on the floor from how hard the door was slammed shut. She blurred out most of that night, but definitely remembered sobbing to a random bartender who gave her a free shot out of pity.

      Lilia chuckled, shaking her head.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s a risk even when you’re home. Besides, Wanda next door will keep an eye on him. He’s nearly seventeen..time to let go of the reigns a tiny bit”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      Agatha scoffed.

     <span>
      “Seventeen in a few weeks and I left him home alone on his own for two and-”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You didn’t leave him alone. Wanda is protective as hell of her boy. She’ll keep Nicky under her wing as well” Lilia said. “Try to enjoy yourself while we’re here. You deserve a vacation..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nodded, bringing her the back of her hand up to press against her face. She rested her elbow on the edge of the window, watching people frantically run around with airport taxis and Ubers flying by. Thankfully, Lilia had turned to talk to the driver, inquiring about his life as she always did with new people.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The final text Nicky sent shined on her screen. She glanced down to read it. Almost as if Lilia’s words were heard across the country did he reply with a small,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Annoying Child: I’ll be okay, Mom. Have fun and bring me home cool shit!!

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She smiled softly, feeling the tiniest weight off her shoulders. It’d never be lifted completely until she was home to lay eyes on him. But, it was enough to let her mind ease somewhat.
     </span>
    </p>

      Mother Gothel: Language, Nicholas. But, probably. Most likely.

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just when Agatha thought she was in the clear. She was a tiny bit reassured by Lilia’s words, distracted from the ache in her heart the way her boy made her smile. None of it was ever that simple. Not for Agatha’s luck of the draw. Lining up with the history of the universe hating Agatha Harkness, her subtle ease was short-lived.
     </span>

      Outside the van, she heard Jen and Alice scream out the cursed name that was sworn to not show up.

      Agatha’s small smile disappeared within a second. Knots tied in her stomach, every muscle tensed up like guitar strings being tightened to the point each string snapped off. She must’ve heard them wrong. Jen said Rio wouldn’t

      Lilia pulled back from the driver immediately. She snapped her head out the door, eyes bulging out of her skull. Agatha thought she’d jump  from her seat to tackle the young woman she borderline adopted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was the reason Lilia was in their lives to begin with. The older woman was her next door neighbor who took her in, doing the same for the other three as well. It’d only make sense after not seeing her in person for over a year to engulf her in a tight squeeze and never let go.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Though to Agatha’s surprise, she didn’t jump out of her seat to exit the vehicle. The older woman maneuvered to sit in the middle seat beside her. Agatha leaned to her left to keep her space, asking a rough,
     </span>

    <p>

      “Would you rather me sit next to you or Rio?”

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t respond. She lowered her head, anxiety starting to pound through her like a bass drum. Picking up the tempo with every passing beat, threatening to send her into overdrive.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span>
      It was a mantra in her mind as if she had to chant what the woman’s name was. Agatha wanted to peel her skin off, rip every bone and organ out of her limbs. This couldn’t be real. Though, Jen’s life being over was very realistic to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The two hadn’t said a word to one another in over a year now. Agatha muted all her social media, trying to forget she ever existed. And now because of Jen’s
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fucking lie,

     <span>
      Rio was just outside of the van. No matter where she sat in it, she’d be a few inches away from Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nope. She couldn’t do it. It was time for her to run off and not care if her friends disowned her for it. Agatha quickly unbuckled the seatbelt, starting to get up before Lilia held her arm back.

      “Fuck off” Agatha grunted.

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, sit your ass down right now. You are not ditching Alice and Jen” Lilia hissed through her teeth with a clenched jaw.

    </p>

      Agatha scoffed.

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’ll be worse if I’m here!” She whispered. “Clearly, there’s a reason Rio never said by-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman couldn’t finish the words. Over a year later and admitting to herself Rio left without a goodbye? No. That realization was hell. It still didn’t feel real and worst of all? Agatha couldn’t make sense of it.

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They never had a fight, argument, or any of the sorts before she left. The final conversation was light hearted. Rio had told her about the job offer and Agatha’s heart shattered, but she never showed it.

       Agatha had her legs sprawled over Rio’s lap. They were lounging on her couch, Nicky’s video game in his bedroom muffled through the ceiling. Both occasionally laughed at the way he’d lose his shit when he lost. With two beers on the coffee table beside them, it was typical Wednesday night for them both. The routine they had for so many years now.

      On one hand, she was correct how they never fought, there was no argument or anger between them. Though on the other? Agatha was wrong when she told herself she never showed the way her heart shattered. All the disappointment, fear, anger. Agatha had worn it on her sleeve like a badge of honor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She never knew Rio watched the life drain out of her. The panic that took over, being replaced and swiftly hidden by false happiness. The first time Agatha, the great liar and actress she was, failed at creating a facade.

       Agatha’s voice cracked during the second word. She was quick to clear her throat, looking elsewhere in a state of confusion. Life without Rio down the street from her? Taking over her house as if she lived there? Coming home to find Rio making dinner while helping Nicky with his homework? Waiting for Rio to go with her before hanging out with their friends?

       She wasn’t going to let Rio talk, not now anyway. Agatha knew she couldn’t kick her out. That would give away how her happiness she kept on her face wasn’t real. What she could do was take control of the moment as much as possible.

       The woman felt tears threatening, creating the worst stinging sensation in her eyes as she realized Rio wasn’t joking. This felt more painful than her mother cutting her off, more than the time she was kicked out of her first apartment, more than any devastating experience Agatha went through in her life.

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She never caught the attitude in her voice, barely registered the words. How there was a bite to her words that left a bad taste on Rio’s tongue. It didn’t help that her tone was followed by the beer bottles shattering in the sink when she tossed them.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Though with all that, Agatha still never knew the way it came off. How Rio must’ve viewed her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You two are adults,” Lilia pointed out. “You can exist in each other's orbit for the sake of your good friends who are about to have a very important life event. You not being there would devastate them”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hated how she was right. Really, really, fucking hated it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her back thudded against the seat, keeping her stare out the window opposite from where Rio would be. Though, the tactic to help was short lived when her ears were graced and cursed with the voice she missed more than anything.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Welcome to LA, ladies”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha gasped, biting her lips hard as she didn’t bother to look over. She didn’t even have to look out to see the cool grin on those lips. How Rio’s voice was still enough to put her on edge. The silk, rich, beautiful sound Agatha memorized better than any song she loved.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m so glad you could make it!” Jen exclaimed. “I was worried you wouldn’t be able to”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio snickered and Agatha hated the little familiar flutter in her heart that followed from it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nonsense,” She said. “I’d never miss this for the world”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha listened as she packed her bags in the back. Alice was rambling on about the places she wanted to visit, asking if Rio had ever been to them yet in her time here.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’ll be fi-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shut up” Agatha muttered the rough cut off to Lilia’s reassurement, thankful the woman wouldn’t take offense to her attitude.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If anyone understood where Agatha’s anger came from, it was Lilia.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had been the one to handle the drunken rages that followed in the first few months. Agatha barely remembered that, but realized it must've happened when she woke up on Lilia’s couch or to the woman making breakfast for her son. She took Nicky to his soccer games and to the movies, even mini golf a few times to let Agatha bury herself in bed when needed.
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Agatha truthfully would never forgive herself for it all. As thankful as she was for Lilia, she already beat herself up enough not being good enough for Nicholas. Though in those rare vulnerable moments, Lilia would remind her how it took a village to raise a child. She validated every single emotion, but ultimately after the two months were up- Lilia kicked the woman back into gear as much as she could.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha returned to life, most likely annoyed Nicky with how involved she was. A teenage boy didn’t want to hang out with his mother and she knew that was normal. But, what he wanted was damned. They had weekly movie nights and ice cream Sunday whether he liked it or not. She tried her best to rid the guilt of letting Rio break her like that, but nothing ever would delete what happened.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was no undo button, no first draft to go back to. Rio was gone. She didn’t say goodbye. The friend Agatha was closest to for years and hopelessly fell in love with left without a trace.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice beamed, climbing into the car to find the spot in front of Agatha. And of course, once
     </span>

      <span>

      the universe really hated Agatha Harkness.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll give Rio the seat next to you,” She said to Lilia with a smile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       You’ll do what now? Nope. HA! Not a chance.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha swatted her hand in the air before Lilia could grab her. She slithered between the two seats, nearly lunging out of the vehicle as if the concrete against her face would be safety. Even facing death herself would be safer than encountering Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She landed on her feet, stumbling slightly before collecting herself-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Well, as much as she could anyway.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was completely running on instinct, a poor attempt at a plan if said plan actually existed. She realized how there was no thinking to her actions the moment she heard Jen’s voice, jolting her body into shock.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha?” Jen asked. “What are you doing?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was a hint of attitude in her words, not surprising in the slightest. If Agatha was in her shoes, she’d feel the same way. She couldn’t blame the woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And as if this couldn’t get any worse? Agatha’s skin started to burn and it wasn’t from the sun nor the heat. No. It was the familiar sensation that Agatha secretly adored.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The heat’s source was a pair of brown eyes, shooting daggers that seethed with fire into her skin. Only one word always entered Agatha’s mind when this sensation settled upon her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Rio.

     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha took in the deepest breath humanly possible. Her lungs inflated to the point her head went from a normal weight to light, dizzy and lost started to take over her. She lifted her body, her upper back stretched as the shoulder blades tried to press together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She could do this. Rio wasn’t going to fucking win more than she already was. Agatha already dreaded spending the next two weeks putting distance between them both. It’d be more exhausting than living a life without Rio in it. That was for damn sure.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But, Agatha Harkness wasn’t a fucking coward. She was strong, cold hearted, a front so tough it made others become the coward she was not.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was not going to-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nicky wanted something from the gift shop”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turned her head over as she used the lie as an excuse. She planned to keep her eyes solely on Jen, but Agatha should have known…that was impossible when it came to Rio. As her eyes landed directly on the being she hated, but loved the most- Her breath hitched.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was always stunning to her. Hangovers, the yearly flu or terrible cold she’d catch and be dead on Agatha’s couch, groggy mornings she barely looked human. Etc, etc, etc- Rio was insanely beautiful no matter what state she was in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Though this…it was,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       different.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Maybe it was the fact she refused to look at a single photo of her for the last year. Agatha had forced herself to ignore the woman’s existence, try and forget she was ever a person in her life. Which was difficult when her friends still spoke about Rio, made plans to have her on FaceTime during dinners and game nights. Her son adored Rio his entire life and would ramble on about the stupid TikToks and video games they played together. It felt she was doomed to be reminded of her existence from every corner. Refusing to look at photos, social media, it was her only tiny piece of control she held.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She envied the way they were able to carry on without her near. Agatha craved to laugh everything off, not feel like she was living in hell over how it all ended. This wasn’t supposed to happen, none of it and Agatha couldn’t understand a single thought anymore.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sure, being in love with her best friend wasn’t easy. She’d spend her days daydreaming about what they could be or now, could have been. Agatha had painful memories of Rio’s girlfriends and flings that all felt like hell.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And yet? Agatha missed when that felt like her death sentence in life.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio wasn’t supposed to leave.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio wasn’t supposed to be so far away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And on top of it all, Rio wasn’t supposed to forget Agatha and leave her behind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Get it when you fly back,” Jen laughed. “Come on, I want to get to the-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen’s words were muffled. Agatha was too busy struggling to ignore Rio’s black shorts that defined her hips perfectly. A green button up shirt with short sleeves resting loosely on her shoulders. Her buttons undone to expose her black top cut off above her belly button, exposing toned abs that nearly made Agatha drool every time Rio revealed them.
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Rio was always, what was it? A
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       ‘gym rat’
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Nicky called it? Whatever the name was, the younger woman nearly lived in the gym and signed up for almost every marathon possible.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha cleared her throat, forcing herself to rip her eyes away to look back at Jen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No uh, I’ll- I’ll be so done with you all by then, I’ll forget” She scoffed, waving her hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen rolled her eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll have Lilia remind-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nonsense! No, I’m-” She laughed, but it was fake. Even she wasn’t convinced by it. “I’ll just take an Uber, meet you guys there”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She thought Jen would give her hell, but shockingly it wasn’t her to speak again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll make sure you grab him something. I’m grabbing him a few things too, so it-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And just like that…Agatha’s vulnerability sponsored by panic was turned off. A switch had been flipped, her eyes filled with rage replaced the way they had wanted to form tears just a few seconds prior.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I wasn’t talking to you” Agatha snarled, cutting Rio’s words off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not a second after, the woman whipped around with power, hair tossed back as she stormed to the airport doors. Unbeknownst to her, Rio was faking amusement the best she could. A weak laugh luckily didn’t hit Agatha’s ears, but enough to earn herself a glare from Jen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Really?” Jen asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I was being nice” She defended. “Not my fault she-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen slammed the van’s door shut, cutting off the others from them both. A hand was on her hip while the other held the handle as if she was going to rip it off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, you listen to me-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jen” Rio sighed.

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

      Rio knew she was right, closing her eyes as she sighed with a tiny nod.

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>

    <p>
     <span>
      “I know,” Jen said. “I’ll deal with her” She gestured to the airport. “I love you both, I understand something happened. But, I can not imagine this trip without you both. Got it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman smiled softly, crossing her arms as she tilted her head to the side.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is Jennifer Kale being
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       nice
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      for once in her life?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She glared, opening the door and gesturing for her to get in. Rio snorted, putting her hands up in surrender before climbing in. Lilia didn’t give her grace from how hard she pulled the woman down beside her, rambling on over how she missed her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look too skinny. Are you eating? I’ll make all of you dinner- No, you’re all too skinny actually. What-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia’s rambling continued on, making her and Rio oblivious to the way Jen muttered to Alice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll meet you guys there”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice sighed, nodding softly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We’ll fix this” She mouthed, but Jen only scoffed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t get your hopes up”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With that, she closed the door again before spinning on her heel. She’d track Agatha down, drag her by the hair, feet, whatever part of her was going to get her to follow most. This trip may have been for their wedding, but Jen had enough. Which wasn’t a secret, especially to the woman she was about to marry.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen didn’t care what had to be done, but this was it. She’d lock them in a closet if necessary. Agatha and Rio by the end of these two weeks would at least be on talking terms again. They had zero choice, even if they knew it or not.
     </span>

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looked at the little charms that said LA all over with shitty designs. Nicky didn’t need a damn thing for his keys. Hell, he wouldn’t want anything from the airport gift shop. She knew her boy would much rather have some sport jersey, something along those lines.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But, she needed to escape Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There you are,” Jen sighed, arms crossed as she walked over. “What the hell was tha-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m really not in the mood for a lecture right now”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The only lecture I want to give is a reminder this is my wed-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wedding trip, we need to be grown adults, what I said was immature and how you want us both there” Agatha’s voice was monotone as she spoke, mumbling under breath at the end. “I got it..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Typically, Jen would be stern and lay into her a bit more. Though she was familiar with this version of Agatha. It appeared briefly, showing more when alcohol was laced through her. She didn’t need a lecture right then.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Especially when it was Rio related.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What happened with you two? Can you finally tell me what-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You already know, Jen” Agatha snickered. “She left without a fucking goodbye. I’m not going to pretend everything is all fine and dandy. I-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’ll be fine,” She sighed. “I’ll kill her with kindness” Agatha smiled wide, blinking her eyes a few times as if she was an innocent Disney character.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen shook her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I wish you two would at least try to mend what happened”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snorted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Make a choice. You want us to exist in peace or hell?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I want my friends back,” Jen sighed. “Don’t you want the same? I know you and I give each other shit, but you’re also

     <em>
      <span>

      one of my closest friends”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How kind..” Agatha fixated back on scanning each charm as if it was the most interesting thing to exist.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m serious. Okay? When they have their stupid video game nights, I don’t have you around to not understand a single thing with. Dinner with Rio on FaceTime is boring without you two making fun of us. We still do things as a group, but you aren’t there”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat, hating the ache in her heart.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      No one had confronted her when it came to how she hid more than ever. She was always anti-social, a ‘
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       loner’
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Nicky called her. After Rio left, Agatha left in a way herself. She physically lived close to them all, but mentally and emotionally remained distant.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You being this nice to me is foreign, Jennifer”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen snickered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And if I tell you Rio just made pretty much the same comment?” She asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s body tensed, shaking her head as she walked away to another section of the store. Jen tossed her head back, muttering a few curse words before following.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t uncommon for the others to point out how in sync they were. So many of their similarities were uncanny. Something Agatha used to find adoring and amusing. Rio seemingly loved it as well.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can we leave now? Please? A bed is calling my name”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I need to get something for Nick-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He does not want anything in here and we both know that” Jen scoffed. “By the time we get there, they’ll all be at the ocean and you can escape to your room. Hell, both of us can”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not toge-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, that joke never gets old” Jen faked a laugh with her nose scrunched.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snickered, picking out a small bag of Cheez-Its on her way to the counter.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Want one? Or still on that annoying diet of yours?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen rolled her eyes, but felt thankful they were making their way to the register.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “At least my diet isn’t the platter of a teenage boy”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, you have never lived with a teenager!” Agatha belted out a strong, heart filled, laugh. “He eats like a monster and it’s hard to resist all the snacks I buy for him”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And yet, you still live with the same diet even away from him. What will you do when he’s off at colleg-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do not bring that word up right now”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen smiled softly, waving her hand at her before pulling her phone out to update Alice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How many wine nights are we going to have when he goes?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll be in AA meetings by dawn” Agatha replied, her voice cold to the touch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my god,” Jen laughed. “He’ll be okay!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Again, I’ve got enough on my mind” A subtle way she referenced Rio without her name being said. “Let me ignore the inevitable”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She put the snack on the counter, going to grab her wallet when-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Shit.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha slowly turned, a begging smile as Jen slowly looked up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You left your wallet with your bag, didn’t you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen deadpanned stared the woman down, but still didn’t hesitate to pull her card out. Agatha snatched it from her, grabbing a Hershey's bar to add to it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Really?” Jen asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, your diet is for you. Your card misses filling its teenage appetite” Agatha shrugged, looking over at the cashier with a smile. “Can you believe we’re related?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No! We are not” Jen was quick to say. “I’d be cursed to be related to your ass”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha added a few more candy bars, thinking the joke had distracted the woman. It didn’t in the slightest, but Jen couldn’t find it in her to argue more. Whatever it took for Agatha to follow without a fight, she’d keep chanting to herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Plus, maybe the snacks would keep her silent for the ride back. One could hope, anyway.
     </span>

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When they stepped through the front door of the beach house, true to Jen’s word (For once, Agatha scoffed to herself) the rest were heard in the distance. The back doors were wide open with a cool sea breeze flowing in. Not that the woman would admit to it, but the house forced a bit of thankfulness in her. It had been years since she took a vacation. The last one being-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Nope. Don’t open that door.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha would not be thinking about their Miami trip when it was only three of them. The three being Agatha, Nicky, and unsurprisingly, Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen led them up the stairs, Agatha in tow as she counted down till the bed greeted her like a blessing. Though as they walked down the hall, both realized signs on each door. Jen walked up the one with her and Alice’s name, registering the hand writing and snickering to herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Lilia assigned us rooms,” She said. “And you all say I’m the control freak” Jen muttered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckled, finding her name with the big smiley face beside it. Lilia’s unspoken words of,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       It’ll be alright.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Three words Agatha desperately needed to hear. Especially as she caught a glimpse of the sign next to her room. A scribbled,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Rio + Hela”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scrunched her nose, squinting her eyes to make sure she read it right. Not over Rio. Her room being right beside Agatha’s from Lilia’s direction wasn’t surprising. Though, she didn’t recognize the name beside it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Whatever. She was too tired to give a shit.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She pushed her door open, sighing with relief when she heard it shut behind her. Finally, solitude at last.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha put her bags down on the bed, looking out the glass doors that led to the balcony, overseeing the beautiful Pacific Ocean stretched out before her. As much as she craved the bed to hide in, she needed to get a few good photos of her view. Besides, it’d be another reason to text Nicky by sending him a few.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She stepped over the threshold, greeted with the sight and sound of the waves crashing. The salt laced with a sulphury scent filled the air. Agatha let her eyes close, basking in the moment, trying to ground herself from the hell that she’d live in for the next two weeks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It’d be fine, it had to be.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Some of her believed it. Well. That was until she pulled her phone out to snap a few pictures and instead saw a notification from their group chat. Rio had added a new member. The same name beside her on the bedroom door.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Who the fuck is, Hela?
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio: Ladies…meet my lady;)
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha felt her stomach spin, the snacks Jen scolded her over suddenly tossing up with fury. She dropped the phone on the balcony table, rushing through the room, desperate to find the bathroom. The woman ripped the door open, hand over her mouth as she started to run through the hall. She was distracted, on a one track mindset, never hearing someone behind her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not until a hand from behind grabbed her hip, the other punching open the bathroom door while pushing Agatha inside. She nearly fell against the counter, hurling into the sink as if poison made her reject everything living in her system. The hands behind her worked quick to pull her hair in a clip, soothing down her back and sides before pulling away. The soft gesture ceasing to exist.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Only when she felt nothing else would come back up, coughing a few times as heavy pants filled the silence, Agatha allowed her head to tip up. She expected that Lilia followed, maybe Jen, Alice was a last bet, but what she didn’t think? Out of any of them?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What are you doing?” Agatha rasped in the mirror, her eyes hardening at the reflection behind her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio visibly swallowed, taking in a deep breath with a tiny shrug.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You get sick after long trip-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay? And?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha whipped around, using all her strength to push Rio away. She didn’t realize the look on her face wasn’t completely anger. The woman held tight onto the ledge of the sink, breathing heavy deep pants, gasping for air and not only from how she had just tossed up every part of her stomach. No.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was close. Too close.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Especially after that text? Hell, the entire reason Agatha had just been violently sick?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And..” Rio sighed, running a hand through her hair with the other firm on her hip. “I just figured-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Figured?” Agatha drew the word out, nearly bruising her chest from how violent her arms crossed against it. “Wha-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I figured to be a fucking frie-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “HA!” Agatha belted, putting a finger up to silence her. “Don’t even finish that word. It’d be one of the highlights of your hypocritical bullshit”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turned back around to distract herself, rinse her face off, maybe the cold water would wash away whatever this hallucination behind her was. She wished to hear Rio’s feet storm out, the door slam shut behind her. Agatha would be free to curse herself out for failing at hiding from Rio. She wasn’t even twenty four hours into the trip. How the hell was she going to survive two weeks?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio puffed out a small laugh, her own arms now crossed against her chest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Since when have I been hypocritical?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, I don’t know,” Agatha shrugged. “Possibly your whole life as far as I’m aware”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She splashed the cold water against her skin, palms digging into her face, eyes squeezed shut as she wished for a genie to grant her with Rio’s disappearance. But if the universe hated Agatha Harkness, every genie and witch would as well.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The water was abruptly turned off, shocking Agatha for a split second, but the water was the least of her worries. She jolted when Rio’s hand slipped away from the knob, arm brushed against her own, pulling away as if she was never there. Over a year of not speaking, seeing, and painfully the reminder of what Agatha missed most-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s fucking touch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sure, Agatha was standoffish. She cursed her friends out in disgust when they hugged her. Unsurprisingly to the rest, Nicholas was the only one she’d ever hold tighter and never complain about. However, what no one would ever believe? Rio was the other holder of that pass.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman was constantly attached to Agatha since they met. At first, Agatha hated it. She’d shrug her off, curse her out, anything to rid her. But slowly as the years went on, it’d become second nature. Rio was her other limb. They were magnets when in a room together. One had their legs over the other, a head on someone’s shoulder or in their lap.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s favorite was when Rio climbed on her instead of taking another chair. The others would laugh and joke how Agatha would kill her, but on the inside? Agatha hoped by wrapping her arms around her waist, propping her chin on her shoulder or cheek against her arm, Rio would never sit anywhere else.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      …Okay, so maybe their friends did know Rio held the other pass. Regardless, the little touch did not help her in the slightest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Before you complain about the water,” Rio started. “I have never been a hypocrite, we both know that. Second of all-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “N-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Agatha”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman was in the middle of reaching for the hand towel when Rio cut her off. No, she didn’t just interrupt her. Rio had the audacity to say Agatha’s name like she still owned it. When they’d have small arguments, if Rio was trying to calm Agatha down, there was a certain way she’d say the world. A small bite to the subtle bark, coldness that still had warmth buried beneath.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And the worst part?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It always worked…Rio saying her name like that
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       still
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      worked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       I hate you.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine, talk” Agatha tossed her hand up, snatching the towel to bury her face in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio took a second, her eyes glaring hard at the woman desperately trying to hide herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We need to co-exist. Can we-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my god!” Agatha laughed. “I’m fucking aware. I got the lecture multiple times today” She turned, clenching the towel in her hand. “I don’t need it again. Especially from you. I’ve already made up my mind when it comes to you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She watched the younger woman slowly smirk, but not in the way she loved. It was taunting, annoyed, a furious version of her own. Rio’s anger was never loud like Agatha’s. She was more-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Meticulous, snarky, devious, sarcastic, evil, sexy, beautiful, hilar-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       No. No. Shut. Up.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio scoffed, gesturing into the space for Agatha to speak.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, what’s the ruling? My sentence,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       your honor?
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s nostrils flared, her glare impossibly strengthened and darkened at once. She hated her. Rio was so fucking insufferable while smirking, mocking, Agatha’s anger. After what she did too?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She found the hamper in the corner, scrunching the towel before tossing it over. The woman shook her head, debating walking out with no word. There was good reason to. She desperately needed to grab her stuff to brush her teeth. The aftertaste of vomit covered with the sight of Rio was enough to make her sick again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Though, Agatha always had to have the last word.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You made your choice, I make mine-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, this must be a
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       very
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      harsh ruling,” Rio’s voice was playful as she dipped her hips down, stepping forward to be an inch closer, an inch below Agatha before popping back up to stand just a sliver above her. “Are you too scared to sentence me your-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t even want to know you exist”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The playful glint in Rio’s eyes flickered and for a brief moment, barely a millisecond- Agatha swore she saw pain instead. However, the woman looked down far too fast for her to study. She laughed, but it was lifeless. Not the mocking one Agatha knew so well.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio sighed, putting hands up as she stepped back, slithering past Agatha with a low,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll forward you the email I got-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed, looking over at her, silently questioning what she was on about. That damn smirk should’ve warned her it wasn’t something sincere. It was a twisted remark, one that managed to dig under Agatha’s skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know, the device to wipe your memory?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you know how ridiculous you sound?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They were close, too close. Agatha thought before with Rio’s hands on her hips behind her, the way she brushed her arm when she turned the water off, it couldn’t get worse. Though, she was completely wrong with Rio’s breath against her lips, she could feel the sarcasm radiating off of her and fuck- Agatha loved and hated it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I could ask the same for you as well..” Rio muttered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She opened the door and gently shut it behind her. For some reason, it only frustrated Agatha more. Though the jealousy of how Rio was able to still remain calm, cool, collected didn’t last long.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha closed her eyes, breathing out the air that she had been reserving in her lungs. Her body relaxed as her back collided against the door with a thump. She ran a hand through her hair while the other remained on her hip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      What the hell did Rio mean by that? She could ask the same? Agatha wanted to laugh over it. After all, she wasn’t the one bringing up emails about memory wipe machines. The woman was in her right to be pissed off. She wasn’t wrong to wish Rio never existed. Especially when she had the nerve to date some bitch named Hela and-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       She’s not mine. I never- She never felt the same.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The reminder was a punch in the stomach. She was a grown woman for fucks sake, puking over her old best friend having a girlfriend? Agatha silently scoffed. How pathetic of a level had fallen to?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Better yet..how the hell would she survive two weeks like this?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      _______
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, when will Hela be here?!” Alice exclaimed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The morning had crept up on Agatha far too sudden for her liking. She hadn’t had a few hours worth of shut eye. Maybe thirty minutes, if that. Her entire night had been spent replaying the bathroom moment in her mind. Rio was so vivid in her brain, an image burned in the forefront of her mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And maybe Agatha spiraled a tiny bit. Well, enough she found herself knee deep in Hela’s social media to the point of high school graduation photos.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn’t know how it started. Agatha opened Rio’s Instagram, caught up on all the posts she had missed over the last year. The woman hated the warm smile on her lips seeing Rio’s achievements, all the hikes she went on, that stupid tarantula Agatha always cringed over.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Victoria.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      A beautiful name for a horrid creature that made Rio so happy. She never missed that little freak in the slightest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Though one photo posted just a few weeks ago was the one to nearly make her run to the bathroom all over again. Rio was sitting in some bar, the Hela woman on her lap. Agatha couldn’t deny Hela was stunning. Far out of her league, perfect for Rio’s lane. They both were laughing with their eyes beaming to the camera. Rio just looked so…happy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha slowly felt the jealousy rising within her. Not only because Hela had
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       her
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Rio. The woman she had by her side for years. Sure, it was Agatha’s fault for falling in love. That still didn’t erase what they had. They were closer than anyone in their friend group. Nicky basically was half raised by Rio. Hela couldn’t say the same. She didn’t know Rio like Agatha did.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It didn’t help either that the entire last year, Rio looked so sickeningly happy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was going on adventures, hanging out with friends, sharing her achievements at work and Agatha knew she should be happy for her. Rio’s well being was always so important to her. There was a tiny sliver of her that did feel pride, but it barely existed. Maybe if Rio said goodbye, she’d be more willing to accept the new reality. However, that was all fucking bullshit. Rio’s happiness was disgusting.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      How could she leave like nothing happened? Rio went on to live her life as if Agatha was never part of it. She took off without a goodbye, made a beautiful life for herself and Agatha hated her for it. She hated Hela. She hated that job. She hated and felt a rage of jealousy, another level that never existed before.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m so excited to meet her,” Jen added.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha made a silent mocking face to herself as she poured coffee into her mug. Lilia had forced her out of bed just thirty minutes prior. She must’ve known the groupchat reveal sent Agatha into a spiral from how close she kept an eye on her. The way she gently woke her up with a soft,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Come on, get up now. Alice is demanding a few adventures today”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She grumbled, but ultimately gave in. Not only for Jen and Alice, but once again- Rio wasn’t going to win. If she wanted to live a life for herself, parade her happiness, smile wide? Agatha could too. Even if it killed her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Most likely tomorrow morning. She’s tangled up with work, but wants to make it here asap” Rio said through a mouthful of food. “She’s awesome, I think you guys will get along well”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What does she do for work?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She’s a biologist”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The other’s gasped and overlapped a few,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, she’s perfect for you!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Now that, that’s a match made in heaven”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Biologist and environmental scientist? What a-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha slammed the coffee mug down in the kitchen, storming through the open dining room with a muttered,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m going for a walk to call Nicholas”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia closed her eyes with a sigh, turning a second after as she watched Agatha fumble to get her boots on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Corner shop just down the road. They’re coffee is better than ours. We have to buy better stuff today” Lilia said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t say anything as she stepped out of the screen door, letting it slam shut behind her. Behind her there was a tense silence before Jen was the one to break it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why did you encoura-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just,” Lilia put her hand up, shaking her head. “I know what I’m doing”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her eyes avoided Rio’s at all costs, not wanting to make the younger woman upset and create more drama in the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She’s just stressing over the boy”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t a total lie on Lilia’s part. Hell, the words were common knowledge to them all. Nicky home for two weeks by himself was putting Agatha on the edge of a panic attack. But at the same time, they all knew who was the biggest catalyst of them all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio took another bite of the scrambled eggs, avoiding looking up as guilt flooded through her like tsunami waves all over again.

      “God, I dread when he goes to college” Jen sighed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice snickered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We may have to admit her to the psych ward for that one”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The three silently chuckled, taking note to Rio’s silence. Lilia luckily knew how to keep the atmosphere in the room light, adding a soft,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think I will always find it hysterical how sweet that boy is considering his mother,” Lilia laughed. “He feels so guilty making someone frown and Agatha wouldn’t blink to do so”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, all besides-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He’s so mature for his age as well. I know she worries with him home alone, but..I wouldn’t agree if I thought he wouldn’t be okay”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia had cut Alice off before she could speak with no filter. It took a moment for the younger woman to switch her reaction from confused to the realization why Jen was glaring from across the table. She mouthed a small,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Oops”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Letting the woman take control of the situation once again. However, it seemingly didn’t work.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio barely voiced her words loud enough to be heard. The three picked up something about a shower as she stood from her chair. Otherwise, she walked away before they could have her repeat what she had said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The scrape against her plate echoed in the silence, clinking against the sink a few seconds after. They waited till her footsteps ran up the stairs to release the same breath all three held in sync.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do we just…lock them in a closet or something?” Jen asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice snickered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Babe, they may set the entire house on fire if we do that”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well!” Jen scoffed, hands tossed up. “I don’t want to hate them for ruining my wed-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They won't,” Lilia shook her head. “By the end of these two weeks, I am sure this will all be resol-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We don’t know that!” Jen laughed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice took a bite of the pancake, asking through the mouthful of food,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Does Agatha still love her?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia tilted her head, eyes flickering between them both that spoke the answer loud and clear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       What do you think?
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen sat back in her chair, defeat covering every inch of her. Alice’s jaw slacked, eyes bulged as she shook her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re really surprised?” Lilia chuckled. “Rio clearly is as wel-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She moved on to Hela,” Alice pointed out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No” Lilia shook her head with a humorous chuckle. “I know that girl better than anyone here. There’s no way-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then what was the no goodbye thing about?” Jen asked, arms folded tight against her chest as she glared Lilia’s way. “Also, why haven’t we confronted Rio with that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Because, it is not our place to do so” Lilia answered. “Whatever that is, it’s between them. We can’t intervene or solve this. They’re adults”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A small silence fell upon the three. The shower above muffled through the ceiling, soft music they couldn’t make out behind it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Unsurprisingly, Jen was the one to break the silence.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nope, I’m sorry, Lilia. I can’t agree with that” She sat up, hands gesture in the air before landing on the table. “One, this is my wedding,” Jen pointed to herself. “Two, it’s gone on long enough”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia scoffed, matching her intense glare.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, then what do you propose is the best way to go about this if you think intervening is right? We will only make matters wors-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How can we?!” Jen exclaimed. “Agatha is clearly- If she still loves Rio, we all know she’s heartbroken about whatever the hell happened with them. Secondly, this is only going to be more of a fuckin’ shitshow the second this Hela woman shows up”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice nodded, pulling her lips back as she apologetically looked over to Lilia.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah..I have to agree. Agatha’s jealousy is another level of insane. We may be going to trial for murder instead of our wedding if we don’t do something”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia closed her eyes, resting her elbow on the table as she pinched the bridge of her nose.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      She knew they were right. The surprise impending arrival of Rio’s girlfriend would result in a full out war before they even got to the wedding. Especially on top of the silent feud they already had between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman sighed with a small nod.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine,” Lilia caved. “But,” She pointed. “If this backfires, do not say I didn’t tell you so”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There, thank you,” Jen tossed her hand up with a smirk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So..” Alice drew out the word, slowly nodding her head as her eyes flickered between the two. “What do we do?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia turned her head to the left end of the table, Alice followed leaving both eyes on Jen. The woman’s face went from victory contorted into slight embarrassment. She looked down at her plate, picking back up her fork to mindlessly stab at the scrambled eggs that were most certainly now cold.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I uh..” Jen stammered. “Didn’t, well..

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice softly smiled, Lilia matching with a tiny snicker of her own.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We’ll sort something out,” Lilia assured. “For now, let’s get through the day with those two”

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Surprisingly, the day they had spent traveling around the city ran pretty smoothly. Agatha kept her distance, Rio did as well. Only a few times did the others catch them on the verge of snarling out a bitter comment or glare at one another.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, it wasn’t always a glare. Neither snarky words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sometimes one would gaze in a lingering, longing, stare. Though once the other turned, it’d be ripped away as if it never existed. As for comments, the three knew the duo better than anyone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The little tug of Rio’s lips that curled when Agatha was amazed by something usually was followed with a comment of knowledge. Agatha would always beam and ramble into a spiral of questions to gain more knowledge from Rio’s wit. And when Rio found something she adored, but refused to buy herself- Agatha would be in tow, picking up whatever her heart desired to purchase it behind her back. Which
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       always
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      led into light hearted bickering between the two, filled with,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Agatha-”

    <p>
     <em>

    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “No! You shouldn’t spend money on me”

    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “I don’t need a financial advisor, but thank you. You’re a very sweet human for it”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “And I don’t need my own personal shopper, but thank you. You’re horrible”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It’d go on and on, sometimes it’d drag for days. Though they’d keep grinning and Agatha would keep buying things while Rio would continue on with rambling her heart out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Safe to say, their hopes were lifted by the tiny signs they were on the verge of slipping back into old habits. Routines that were so familiar to them all. It never happened. Instead glares replaced while the other stormed off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Toward the end of the day, the group found themselves at a small restaurant. Lilia insisted they sit outside to watch the sunset over the ocean, enjoying the soft breeze in the air.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen had tried to push Agatha and Rio to sit beside one another, but they were a step ahead as if they expected her antics. Instead, they ended up across the table from each other. Alice had to restrain herself from laughing at the way Jen almost stomped her foot like a toddler who didn’t get her way.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The chatter between the group flowed easy with the occasional comments from Agatha, but they were rare. The other three were used to it. When she did hang out over the last year, she was silent. It wasn’t anything abnormal to them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, who wasn’t used to it? Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn’t know Agatha to shut the hell up in their entire time of being friends. The woman always had something to say leaving Rio would be the quiet one between them both. Sometimes she only waited till after they left on their own to speak, finding it easier when she only had Agatha by her side. Which she always found ironic because Agatha was more introverted between them both, but in social situations the one who spoke the most.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And now? She was the quiet one. Rio didn’t know what to do with the new reality before her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, Agatha,” Lilia said, a bit of teasing to her words. “Have you and Wan-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, for fucks sake..” Agatha muttered, bringing the wine glass to her lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen and Alice made sure to chuckle, but weren’t able to hide the wide eyes aimed Lilia’s way. Screaming the same question in sync,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “What are you doing?”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t a secret between the four Agatha and Wanda had hooked up, maybe more than once. A few times they had teased Agatha on it, but nearly faced their death every time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wait, what?” Rio sat up, eyes frantically flipping between Agatha and Lilia. “What about Wanda?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia’s head tilted, hiding her smirk behind the glass of wine while her eyes gently expressed the answer to their question,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Bingo”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s eyes were bulging out of their sockets, jaw clenched as she frantically looked between all of them one by one to figure out if this was a joke. Only then did the two wives to be share a knowing glance to each other. Lilia who was against intervening hours prior suddenly lit flames that’d explode into a raging fire. One Jen and Alice wouldn’t have dared to touch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They hooked up a few months ago, but neither will admit to it” Jen answered, giving a glance to Agatha who was glaring directly at Lilia. “Isn’t that righ-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jennifer, do you value your life?” Agatha asked. “If so, I’d shut it before you even star-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” Jen laughed, putting her hands up with a wide smile. “I’m not lying!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha never admitted out loud to her friends what had happened. Nicky and Billy were on a field trip for school. They weren’t due home till close to midnight from the trip. It was the first time Wanda and Agatha had let their boys go that distance alone. Their entire lives, the boys had sleepovers next door to one another. The duo never ventured far to other friends besides each other.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Wanda had shown up on Agatha’s doorstep with a bottle of red and two wine glasses, eyes puffy as she laughed through her words,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Drink with me?”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman was never one to say no to a drink. Plus, the house being vacant and knowing her son was still hours out? It’d be a nice distraction.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      One drink led to another, a kiss led to articles of clothes being discarded, next thing they knew- They were hooking up nearly every week. The others seemed to think it was just a one and done deal. How they figured it out, Agatha would never truly know. Though with Wanda, that woman didn’t know how to keep a secret.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha never fully admitted to it. A verbal confirmation was never offered. Only glares and frantic words to change the conversation, flip the focus to someone else.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, with Rio across from her? She had a girlfriend, new friends, a life that looked better than ever. Agatha took a generous sip from her wine, letting it loosen her nerves and spit out the words,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine. What about it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia gasped, Alice snickered while Jen belted out a laugh as she clapped.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And there it is, ladies! Took the bitter woman long enough to confirm what we already knew” Jen exclaimed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wanda told us,” Alice outed. “She’s very impressed by your skills in the bedshee-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, fucks sake. No, no. I answered and we are not diving in-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We need details from your end!” Jen beamed. “Come on, this is the best wedding gift you could give me”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I feel like taking your life would be a beautiful gift for myself,” Agatha smiled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not me though” Alice pointed. “Don’t get any ideas”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Your future wife goes on, cement blocks tied to her feet will be her new look”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Sexy” Alice mocked, earning a small smack on the shoulder from Jen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As they continued on with their banter, Jen pushing and asking multiple questions without stopping- Lilia kept her eyes on Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Even if Lilia didn’t know Rio well, it wasn’t a secret what was running through her mind. The way she was slumped in her chair, sipping from her beer, barely removing it from her lips. The eyes that bulged now sank into what could only be described as the fifty yard stare. They focused on the table as if the wood grain was the most beautiful thing to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Heartbreak, fear, it was swallowing her whole as she wore it on her all over her outfit and deep past her skin. Lilia knew Rio never fell out of love with Agatha. To her, the two were soul mates. Over the years, she pulled many cards from her tarot deck, trying to sort how to bring them together. Ultimately, fate was the only path for them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Though, this little push. Maybe it wouldn’t bite them in the ass. Lilia feared karma worse than fate. She never wanted to jeopardize or jinx them both. And? Jen was right, how could things get possibly worse than where they were with each other?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Congrats” Rio cut off Jen’s words, not knowing what they were. “You fucked your best friend. Hallelujah. You aren’t special for it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Oh. Fuck.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Okay, Lilia wasn’t expecting that and she already was laying out her lecture on how they shouldn’t interfere with the universe’s timing. Jen on the other hand was shamelessly smiling like a fool. For a woman who demanded no drama, she was high on what ultimately could make or break this trip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      An awkward silence was a weight dropped upon the table. Alice and Lilia shared a worried glance, Jen was grinning like a mad woman, and Agatha? She turned her head slowly to find Rio looking down, not offering attention after the words she had voiced.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman held her wine glass a bit away, head tilted as she drew the two words out, covering them in a coating of attitude,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Excuse me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You heard me”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t miss a beat as she looked up, glaring at Agatha like she fucked Wanda to intentionally hurt her. The heartbreak felt so strong, the younger woman found it hard to remember Agatha never knew her feelings. She wasn’t in love with her. Agatha didn’t need to be loyal to her. Not to mention, she chose to leave without a word. How would that portray love?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not like you’re the only lesbian out there to do that” Rio shrugged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shit” Alice muttered under her breath as she picked up her own beer to take a swig from.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed, putting the wine down as she crossed her arms, leaning back in the chair with a stronger glare.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What the hell is your problem?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t have one,” Rio lied.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You don’t? Really?” She snorted, shaking her head. “God, you’re a shit liar”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Guys..” Alice muttered the soft warning, but Jen smacked her thigh under the table. An unspoken gesture to let them continue. “Jen, hone-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen whipped her head, shooting daggers as she mouthed a strong,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Let it happen”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Thankfully, the duo on the verge of a battle were oblivious to their friends. Agatha was too busy staring at the woman who was avoiding her all over again. Rio had looked down again as if she was ashamed to know her, she was small, words nonchalant while her attitude was somewhat…mocking? Agatha couldn’t pinpoint exactly what this was.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman puffed out a laugh filled with disbelief, looking down as she picked her wine back up because
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fuck-
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      She needed it to put up with whatever the hell Rio was on about.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right, you’re so special. Aren’t you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      In any other context, Rio loved when Agatha spoke to her with endearing comments. When she showered her with compliments, called her
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Dear” “Honey”
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      and all of the above. This should’ve been one of those times Rio would feel her skin burn, shade a deep red as she struggled to hide a giddy grin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, it wasn’t. Not with the tone of voice that was covered in sarcasm. So bitter it left a bad taste on Agatha’s tongue, creating an upset stomach for Rio. Not when the context wasn’t a fond moment between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Typical,” Agatha muttered. “Avoidant cliche lesbian acting as if her shit doesn’t stink”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What is that supposed to mean?” Rio asked, eyes snapping up to shoot her own fire back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, not all of us take a job offer and skip town, better yet moves across the
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       country,
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      without a single goodbye”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And just like that, the elephant in the room was stabbed. The tight wire was snapped, cut loose to explode the charges of dynamite it held together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Oh…fuck.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s smile was wicked. With venom so vicious, she hoped her words would sink into Rio’s skin and drain her of life. She didn’t want her
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       ex
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      best friend anywhere near her. Not in the same state, country, and better yet- Not across a fucking table from her, acting as if she was innocent.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had a girlfriend. Rio left without a goodbye, ultimately ending their friendship. Who was she to judge who Agatha slept with?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman snickered over Agatha’s words. A low laugh hidden behind the beer that was brushing against her lips, ready to take a swig when needed. And when Agatha was around? One beer would never be enough to put up with her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh! So, it’s a joke to you?” Agatha perked up in her seat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha..” Lilia muttered a warning for her to settle down, but that was impossible.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha put her hand up to the older woman, eyes never parting from Rio, hoping to stare her down to send her away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No! No, clearly
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Rio here
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      doesn’t care about what she did-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There it is,” Rio muttered under her breath.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The jealousy,” Rio cleared her throat, lowering the beer to let Agatha see her face bright with glory. “You can’t stand I received a job offer with pay you couldn’t dream of”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       No..it’s that you never said goodbye to me..
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s jaw loosened, hanging ajar as her eyes drooped from rage into sadness. How could she think that? Rio left without a goodbye and it wasn’t like Agatha didn’t make it clear how that was what pissed her off. Her own best friend, the one she trusted and fell sickeningly in love with (Not that Rio would ever know) said a grand old farewell to everyone in their friend group but her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Excuse me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This time, the two words weren’t covered in attitude. Instead disbelief and pain drenched them. The Wanda subject had completely left her mind for that moment because this? It was worse. Agatha never wanted to face what had happened. She ignored the reality as much as she possibly could, never thinking it’d get worse until-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s true! I know you, Agatha. Jealousy isn’t something you hide well” She snorted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instead of fighting back like she normally would. How she usually matched Rio and offered a harsher reply, Agatha pulled back. She looked away with her lips pulled back, debating how to run off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Did Rio not know Agatha like she thought? The one woman who made her feel seen, heard, known thought horribly of her like everyone else would. Jealousy. That’s what she thought of Agatha, saw in her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t see her how destroyed she was…but, isn’t that what she wanted?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had to run. Fuck it, if Alice and Jen would be upset with her, Agatha would deal with it later. She didn't bother to let her eyes scan the table, leaving her oblivious to how their friends stared in disbelief themselves.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They couldn’t fathom the words Rio had spoken. Sure, Lilia’s push had worked. They finally faced what came between them, but did they expect this? Well…why would they ever?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman stood up aggressively, nearly knocking the chair over as she snatched her purse from the back of it. Agatha struggled to find her wallet to leave money for her drink. Her heart was thundering, tears boiling up within her as she was seconds away from screaming at Rio right there.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha..” Alice sighed. “Come on-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No uh, I need to go call Nicky” She stammered as she shook her head. “Check in, make sure he isn’t throwing a damn party or whatever”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was a pathetic lie. One her friends would see through completely, including Rio. She didn’t care. Whether it’d be anger or frustration that led to tears, she didn't know what was going to come first and sure as hell wasn’t interested in finding out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey..” Jen reached up, placing her hand over Agatha’s trembling one that jolted away the second she touched. But, Jen had gotten what she wanted. Her eyes locked with Jen’s, reading her silent word,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Go”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t argue or waste a second to storm off without a goodbye, not a glance over her shoulder. The woman worried one of them would come running after her and
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fuck-
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t need that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Luckily for her, unknowingly as well, her friends were too busy to follow as their attention was on Rio. Three daggers were aimed from different angles, all directed at the woman who was smirking to herself in victory before she looked up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      All her glory shifted to confusion, lips parting to ask a low,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” She asked, shrugging her shoulders before rushing a quick, “I’m not wro-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, bullshit!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you fucking kidding me?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio, what the hell?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The responses piled on top of one another. Their words were mixed with frustrated laughter, annoyed sighs and grumbles piled on top.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shook her head violently, leaning forward as she put her elbows on the table. Her finger then pointed in the direction Agatha walked off, eyes strong with a stubborn,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, I know her. There's no way she gives a shit about a goodbye. We aren’t like that! She’d never want a sappy so long and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “God, you are a fucking moron” Alice scoffed, shaking her head as she got up. “I need some air before I punch you in the fa-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Honey,” Jen sighed, looking up at the woman who was already taking off from the table. “Don’t..anddddd, she’s gone. Nevermind”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia shook her head, silently cursing herself out for allowing the situation to explode to that level. Jen was about to speak, her lips parted and ready to lecture Rio for her ridiculous claims. But if matters couldn’t get any worse?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, well..” A deep voice rasped, sneaking up behind Rio to leave a kiss on the top of her head. “Don’t you look divine”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s limbs went tense, she jolted in her chair as her head spun to look up. The other two frantically snapped their eyes together with a strong,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       No.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hela..you’re early” Rio forced a smile as if a fight didn’t just happen with the woman she loved most.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “A bad thing?” The woman asked, a playful smile on her lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, uh, not at all” She chuckled, looking over to gesture to her friends. “Guys, this is Hela,” Rio introduced. “Hela, this is Jen and Lilia”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ah, Jen”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela grinned as she rounded the table to sit next to her, taking the spot Agatha was previously residing in. Rio hated the twist in her stomach, longing for her to be Agatha instead,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, about to get yourself hitched, huh?” Hela asked. “Where’s the one you’re tying yourself to?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen faked a laugh the best she could. Especially after the situation that had just happened barely five minutes prior. How was she supposed to act like everything was fine?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Um-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alice and Agatha went back to the house. Both are exhausted from the day” Lilia smoothly lied, taking the reins for Jen who gave thankful eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ah,” Hela slowly nodded, a tisk of her tongue against the roof of her mouth right after. “So, the infamous Agatha Harkness has decided to join the party?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What’s that supposed to mean?” Jen asked, her stance ready to defend Agatha when needed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela gestured her head over to Rio who was buried in herself, embarrassment and fear drowning her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio wouldn’t shut up about Agatha since the invite. Went on about how she’d probably never leave her son” She chuckled. “I’m just surpri-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I wouldn’t let Agatha miss this” Jen said, eyes flickering to Rio with a fake grin. “Surprised Rio doubted my abilities to make Agatha do something”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia cleared her throat, taking center stage to protect them from the awkward silence hanging above.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, Hela,” She started. “Why don’t you tell us a bit about yourse-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen’s phone buzzed on the table, Alice’s message shining bright as she swiftly unlocked the screen to it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice: Everything is fine, but you may want to follow. Just got an Uber to bring Agatha to urgent care. She’s arguing me left and right, but fell on her head pretty fucking hard.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice: She’s barely fucking shit this doesn’t look good
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice: Honey, I really need your help. We aren’t far from the restaurant. Just make a left down the sidewalk and you’ll see us
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen’s following movements were erratic. The way she almost flipped the table over, jumping from her chair as she made sure to grab her phone and purse.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wha-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha hit her head, something about blood and she’s trying to fight Alice on urgent care. I have to go he-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll go with you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Rio was quick on her feet, not caring to grab her belongings, but Lilia’s hand reached out to grasp her wrist. She shook her head, gently staring at her with unspoken words first before ones that could be heard by all,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Not after what just happened”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Leave them to handle her,” Lilia spoke. “We both know Agatha will lose her cool even more if we all bombard her. Two is enough”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are we sure?” Hela asked. “It’s their wedding trip. Agatha would understand if we-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, you don’t know, Agatha,” Jen laughed. “Rio and you taking her- I’m not sure who’s life would be more in jeopardy”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio swallowed the lump in her throat, shaking her head. Every part of her that held pain and resentment disappeared.
     </span>
     <span>
      Agatha was hurt and Rio couldn't handle staying away, being left behind, having to idly stand by waiting for updates.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jen-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio, we said no” Jen glared. “Now, I need to go before she tries to run off like a moron..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen left without a word, leaving Rio frozen in her spot. Hela was saying something, but it was muffled as her eyes were locked on the door her friend had stormed through. Every worst case scenario was racing through her mind, straight into her heart that ached heavier by the second.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      What didn’t help? She was the one that’d be called to get her to go. Not Jen. It wouldn’t be Alice convincing her either. Agatha's safety, her protection, it was always Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Every time Agatha pulled something like this, refused to go to a medical environment because it was her biggest fear- Rio had been the one to bring her. She’d stay by her side, reassure her and be her voice. Hell, Agatha had signed paperwork years ago Rio was able to speak to doctors on her behalf.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio felt her stomach turning, heart thundering against her chest from hating it wasn’t her, to the panic of what Agatha had done.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Did she fall? She must’ve. And blood? Her head?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nope. Rio couldn’t listen to Jen and Lilia. Even if she knew they were right and after what just happened. How her presence to an already stressed Agatha wasn't ideal. Logic, common sense, fuck everything and anyone who dared to tell her different.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She sputtered out a pathetic excuse about the bathroom, running off without listening to her girlfriend’s words. Lilia on the other hand knew what she was doing, but didn’t have the energy to stop her. Besides, someone had to keep Hela distracted from this mess.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio felt out of her body, like time and the world wasn’t real as she made her way out the front door. The chaotic sounds of the street wasn’t loud in the way it should be. Every worry, scream of regrets, they were far too loud to ignore.
     </span>
     <span>
      Her eyes looked both ways until seeing Jen’s figure standing above the one sitting on the ground. Alice was pacing around, on the phone with what Rio assumed was the ambulance. She couldn’t stay still as her legs had a mind of their own, nearly running till she was able to hear their voices,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This is ridiculous, it’s nothing”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, for the millionth fucking time, you smashed your head on
      <em>
       con-fucking-crete
      </em>
      . You are going to the hospital”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Urgent care was fine!” Agatha argued. “Hell, I think that’s a step too far. This is noth-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stepped around Jen, scanning her eyes up and down the woman who was holding Alice’s flannel against the wound. There were dark blood trails down her face, dropping onto her blouse. She felt sicker than before, blaming herself with every fiber of her being. If Rio never said that, if she faced the pain of saying goodbye, if she just-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What are you doing here?” Jen asked, arms folded against herself with a glare. “I told yo-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What happened?” Rio asked, completely ignoring Jen's annoyance beside her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looked over, her blue eyes that were glossed over with a wall of tears met her worried ones. She swallowed the lump in her throat, shrugging as her shoulders tensed back to appear strong.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nothing” She lied.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio scoffed, throwing her arm up to point at the damage of her skull.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, so you just wear blood for fashion now?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Always one step ahead of the trends” Agatha smirked at first before her lips then dropped into frown filled with anger that made Rio cringe. “Go awa-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just as she was in the middle of talking, the flashing lights of the ambulance truck turned the corner. Alice waved her hands in the air, jumping a bit to show them where they were. As if they didn’t know from the sight of a woman sitting on the sidewalk. Rio muttered a few curse words under her breath the second they started to slow down. Without a countdown in her mind, Agatha's voice already started spitting the words Rio knew would come out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nope. Not going. No way, I’m not-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha” Jen sighed. “This isn’t something to ignore”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll- We can get band aids and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not fucking stitching your head back together” Jen snorted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stitches?!” Agatha's voice cracked, eyes wide as fear struck like lightning. Rio silently cursed Jen out for scaring her more than she already was.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For how tough Agatha Harkness was to everyone, Rio knew medical situations and procedures were her nightmare. From the car accident her and Nicky were in years ago, when Agatha broke her ankle from falling down the stairs, when Rio needed to get an emergency tooth extraction- Agatha had been the only driver available. Rio still laughed at the memory. Her friend confused everyone in the waiting room from how she paced, bit the skin off her thumb, appearing as if she was the patient from her anxiety radiating off of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shook her head, pushing Jen aside to squat down beside the woman, be damned what Agatha thought of her right then. Rio wasn’t going to leave her side even if the woman held a gun against her head to do so. Not until she was secure in that ambulance and on her way to the hospital.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio gently spoke, careful to not set the woman off even more. She studied the way Agatha shivered and looked away, debating the tactic she’d use. Ultimately, the woman decided to use the one that was always bulletproof.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We go now, get this taken care of, Nicky has his mother home in one piece. We don’t go and I’ll have to call him with news that’ll destroy him” She said, clapping her hands softly with a strong, “Dealer’s choice, babe”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen took a double take at the small name neither seemed to realize she used. The woman waited for Agatha to shove her back, tell her to fuck off and she’d tell Rio tater on that night,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Told you that was a bad idea”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     To her surprise (And relief), it wasn't that. She watched the familiar sight. How Agatha took in a strong breath, Rio studying her closely, ready to argue her at every point. The older woman must've remembered how Rio wouldn't give in. No matter what had happened in the last year, the last fifteen minutes, Lilia's claim Rio was still in love with her...it was true.
    </p>
    <p>
     How on earth Agatha didn't see it, Jen would never know.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine,” Agatha huffed, muttering a string of curse words under her breath. “But they aren’t coming over here. I can fucking walk”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Rio or Jen could say anything, Agatha started to push onto her feet. Not a second after did she stumble, tipping to the side from her balance being out of line from the fall. The woman behind was quick to lunge up, grabbing her hips to steady Agatha before she fell again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Easy, killer” Rio smirked a bit. “Looking to damage both sides, huh?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed because even with her anger, Rio's touch, her voice, how she was caring for her like nothing ever happened. Fuck. She hated how safe Rio made her feel. As if an asteroid could strike earth and as long as Rio was holding her, standing behind her, Agatha would be okay.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Will it make me forget your annoying self exists? Then yes” She muttered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio rolled her eyes, feeling slight pain in her heart how Agatha was adamant with wanting to erase her, but she didn’t hold onto it for long. Her focus was helping Agatha walk over to the ambulance doors that swung open, ready to take her hostage (Rio knew that was the exact word Agatha would use). And just as Rio thought of it, Agatha's body went still, her feet turned into cement blocks that wouldn't move.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nope, not happening. I-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, Nick. So, your mother refused to get her head checked after taking a brutal fall. What’s that? You don’t think she
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       loved
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      you enough to get it taken care of? Oh, tha-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re fucking horrible. That’s low, sickeningly low, Rio” Agatha spat, but her body loosened as she started to walk again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Rio snorted behind her, her smirk wide and Agatha didn't need to turn around to see it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Worked, didn’t it?” She asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha never replied as the EMT’s took over to help her in the truck. Rio stayed close, making sure she allowed them to guide her and wasn’t going to either run off or drive away to collect herself a grand theft auto charge.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She sighed of relief once Agatha was in the gurney and allowing the EMT to work with her. But, all the relief turned into anger because this was it. This wasn’t like old times where Rio would jump in without a second thought. Agatha wouldn’t want her to do so either and Rio wondered if she’d need an EMT herself from how her heart ached as the realization punched her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio forced herself to turn around, thanking the EMT that was speaking with Alice as she made her way back to Jen who remained still on the curb.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright," She cleared her throat, choking her sobs back. "Uh, text me if you need anything. Keep an eye on her. Maybe one of you go in the truck or-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why aren’t you doing that?” Jen asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman tilted her head with the expression screaming how Jen should be able to answer that on her own.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Really?” She asked. “Jen, Agatha- After what just happened, I doubt she wants me to go wit-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just as she was speaking, pointing out what she figured was the obvious, a voice behind cut her off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Uh, Rio Vidal?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched Jen's eyes light up, frantic movements to grab Rio by the shoulders, roughly spinning her around with a loud,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This is her!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The EMT smacked the edge of the door twice before waving his hand, signaling for her to go back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Great, Ms. Harkness asked for you to ride to the hospital with her”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Huh?
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shook her head, but the EMT disappeared in the truck and Jen shoved her from behind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Get a move on before she knocks him out and makes a run for it” She ordered. “Alice is going back to Lilia and Hela. I’m following in the Uber”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Hela. Shit.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Fuck it. She didn’t matter. Not when Agatha needed her. Deep down though, Rio knew Hela didn’t matter in any scenario. Especially when Agatha was involved, but, that was a thought for another time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nodded, collecting strength before jogging over and not wasting a second to hop in the truck. Agatha’s attention drew to her instantly and Rio knew exactly why she asked for her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman was panting, tears streaming down her face that mixed with the blood. She wondered what the EMT said to bring out more fear, what happened, maybe the scenery of the truck settled in. Though, her body slipped into action like second nature. Almost as if she was riding a bike for the first time in forever.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey..” Rio gently greeted, slipped beside her to sit by her side. She mindlessly brought her hand up to rest on the woman's arm with a soft, “This is nothing, Ag-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Exactly! I don’t need to go” Her voice strained, a few sniffles right after.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shook her head, lips parting to speak when the two doors shook the truck as they slammed shut. It brought out a subtle whimper from Agatha who started to sit up, but like every time before? Rio was always ten steps ahead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

     </span>
     <span>
      She slid her hand down to place on top of Agatha’s, feeling the way the woman quickly laced their fingers together and gave a strong squeeze. Rio didn’t even care if she managed to snap her bones, shatter them to pieces. Agatha still trusted her. After everything,
      <em>
       Agatha still trusted her
      </em>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re doing this for Nicky” Rio reminded. “Plus as much as blood is your color, I’m not big on how a head injury looks on you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha gasped for air between suffocated sobs, her eyes gazed over to Rio's with a tiny scoff,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re so kind”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio winked with a small squeeze around Agatha's hand. Before she could speak, the EMT came back through the door, stepping up with a soft smile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, we’re taking off in a minute. Your friend out there is uh…intense” He nodded.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha and Rio both turned their heads to him, then together again as they spoke one word in sync,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Jen"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman laid her head back, lazily smiling as Rio took the lead to speak,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh god,” Rio laughed. “What is she doing?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      He snickered, scribbling words on the clipboard, half monitoring Agatha's head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Making sure my buddy drives carefully”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groaned, rolling her eyes as Rio laughed harder. The man laughed,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "I take it she's known for this?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "There's a reason she's still in my life. I'm not allowed any other choice" Agatha grumbled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "You're lucky to have her," He said, gesturing over to Rio a second after. "Along with Ms. Vidal here. My buddies, they'd never jump in without a second thought like her"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With that, he slipped away to the front seats, leaving the two alone again. This time with a slightly awkward silence that felt painful.  Rio expected Agatha to pull away with the reminder of reality, but her grip only loosened just a bit.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The driver's side door truck opened and slammed shut, her grip that loosened tightening as if she never let go. Rio wasn't sure if she should speak. The words that EMT left them with still lingered. Rio kept thinking about how after this, they'd go back to estranged friends that used to be close. This was a glimpse into who they were. Rio was Agatha's safety, her closest friend, the woman she never pushed away and wanted near every second of the day.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      How was she supposed to move on after this? Rio thought Agatha would hate her for eternity and now she held her hand as if letting go wasn't an option.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Incase..I killed myself with th-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jesus, Agatha!" Rio exclaimed. A jolt of shock struck through her at how the silence was disrupted. The words she chose to say too pissed Rio off slightly. “It’s a concussion, few stitches, if anything. You’re drawing to dramatic conclus-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I was never fucking jealous of your job,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       idiot
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ” Agatha cut off, looking down at the blood on her blouse. She didn’t allow a moment of silence to add on, “I don’t even know how you got to that, but..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman stared in disbelief, feeling her heartstrings tug tiny hopes in her stomach up. Agatha wasn't only trusting her, wanting her close, now she opened up to her after being shut down for what Rio expected would never change. Which only led Rio to one thought,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <em>
       How hard did she fucking hit her head?
      </em>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Clearly, Agatha wasn’t in her right mind and this was not the time to talk about them. The injured woman needed to rest, not bring up a topic so touchy and sensitive, they nearly set the restaurant up in flames.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No,” Rio shook her head, a nervous chuckle through the following words, “We aren’t doing this right now”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You don’t get to decide that” Agatha argued, glaring at her as she added the familiar bitter words from before. “You may have gotten to decide how you left, but you don’t get to tell me no for telling you the truth”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, you hit your head. You don’t know what you’re talking about”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you fucking kidding me?” Agatha ripped her hand away as if Rio burned her. On the other side, Rio felt her skin freeze without her touch. “Don’t- You’re really using me hitting my head to keep your stupid narrative true?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio scoffed, trying to ignore the frustration, keep her demeanor calm to make sure Agatha's anxiety would be okay. However, Agatha was (Unsurprisingly) making that very difficult.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha" She said in a low voice, nearly monotone to keep her emotions under control. "You smashed bottles. Gave me a cold shoulder and-" Rio sat back, shaking her head with her hands up in surrender. "No, not right now. This isn’t ideal to-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “None of this is ideal!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha
     </span>
     <span>
      voice trembled, on the verge of more sobs. She shook her head and winced from the pain, squeezing her eyes shut. Rio reached up to hold her again, but this time Agatha’s hand swatted at her to keep distance between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I wasn’t jealous..”
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio swore the words were slurred, but maybe that was her own adrenaline running high. Her hearing going out of whack when emotions and tensions ran high was common. She didn't put much thought into it, too busy hearing Agatha's words that stabbed her heart once again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Living without you terrified me because I stupidly.."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <em>
       Stupidly? Wait, being without me terrifies her?
      </em>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Fucking hell, Rio.." Agatha rasped.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman didn't get the chance to ask the questions running through her mind because they all came to a screeching halt. A stop as if the airplane engine stopped working, suddenly falling from the sky at a rapid speed that felt life threatening. Agatha's
     <span>
      head had dropped, her eyes closed and Rio took a few seconds to realize-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, hey! She- She’s out, she passed out, please. Help, I-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She couldn’t hear the way her voice strained yelling at the EMT for help. How her body lunged up, hands grasping the woman's shoulders, not hearing her voice repeat Agatha's name like a mantra. Rio didn't take offense when the EMT shoved her hands away, calmly telling her to take a seat. How she registered his words to do so, Rio wouldn't know. Her entire body began to vibrate in fear, unable to look away,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "I'm-" Rio whimpered, saying the words barely above a whisper, loud enough for her to hear only. "I can't live without you"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      The sounds of heart monitors and low chatter surrounded Rio. Her knee bounced rapidly, thumbnail being nibbled down to the skin as her eyes locked on the hospital bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha laid peacefully, breathing at ease while the heart monitor beeped a steady rhythm. The CT scan was clear for any internal bleeding, only a couple of stitches were needed. The doctor told them Agatha walked out with luck on her side. For once, the universe wasn't against her.
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>

    <p>

      Even through Rio’s panic, Jen and her fell into a fit of laughter when they were able to lay eyes on her after all was said and done.

       Rio tried to suffocate the laugh before it exploded. She covered her mouth, turning around to stand in the doorway as Jen smacked her shoulder.

       “Don’t wake her up!” She hissed through a laugh. “Oh wait, would it have come back gray? Agatha Harkness with a streak of gray hair?!” Jen lit up, continuing on, “If she continues to sleep this deep, we can bring bleach and gray dye in”

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>

      However, Rio’s laughter was short-lived.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen had gone back to the house to update the others, collect some clothes for Agatha when she was discharged the following morning. Rio advised her to do so, both knowing well Agatha in a hospital gown would only add fuel to the fire of fury.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Ripping her attention from Agatha was the phone in her hand, Nicky’s name appearing on her screen and-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Shit.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They had been so wrapped up in the chaos to remember Agatha’s nightly call with her son. Unlike other teenagers who wouldn’t mind having a night without reporting to their parent- Nicholas wasn’t that way.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The boy was far too emotional, sweet, protective of Agatha more than anyone else. He most likely was sitting at home, maybe at Wanda’s- Rio hoped for the second.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky: Rio, mom isn't answering. She ok?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio: Shit, hey, sorry. She's alright. Took a fall on the sidewalk earlier today. Few stitches, little concussion, all good to go. She's just sleeping.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky: What?!?!!?!
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      Nicky: And she said it'd be me in the hospital during the two weeks!

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman snickered to herself, imagining the way his grin was hidden through amusement. How he’d definitely be using this against his mother just as she would do to him. The similarities, how he was Agatha’s twin, Rio always adored it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>

      Nicky: Wait, they didn’t remove any part of her hair, right?

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio: Thankfully, no. I would’ve been packing her on a plane, sending her right back to you before she could kill anyone over that

      Nicky: Tell mom to text me a photo of the cut when she’s up
     </span>

    <p>

    <p>

      She locked her phone with a tiny smile. Sure, her job, living in California, was beautiful. A dream that had come true, something she worked her entire life for.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, Rio would never deny how homesick she was. Mostly for two individuals over a place.

      The one on the hospital bed before her with the other hopping on his PC back in New York. She spent what felt like all her life with Agatha by her side, helping raise Nicky from the day he was born.

      Hell, Rio was the only one Agatha wanted in the hospital room when she gave birth to him.

      That day was one of the most vivid memories of her entire life. His cry gracing her ears for the first time, how Agatha held him close in disbelief.

      Rio and Agatha never shared the moment with the others. None of them knew how Nicky was named by Rio. The way she argued Agatha left and right.

      He was not an Eric, James, Henry, or the worst- Fucking, Victor. Rio was thankful to talk Agatha out of that one. She’d also expected a thank you from the boy later in life.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      Safe to say, the friends she had made, Hela, none of them filled the void. The blank space in her life, heart feeling like a black hole that could never be filled.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      She didn’t get to linger on the emotions long. Thankfully, Jen had snapped her out of it as she entered the room with a small smile.

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      The woman held the small cup of coffee out her way. Rio’s shoulders dropped with a sigh, thankful eyes screaming gratitude as she took a generous sip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>

     </span>
    </p>

      Rio shook her head, listening as Jen scraped the chair across the floor to sit beside her.

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Either blood loss or just adrenaline, anxiety from it all” She shrugged. “Not the first time she’s passed out from anxiety. My tooth extraction, I swear I would’ve had to call us an Uber the second they called my name”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen snickered, shaking her head softly.

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “God..I miss you two”

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s face fell, looking away as her finger flicked the edge of the coffee’s lid. Listening to the little crack of the plastic, hoping the subject would change because truthfully-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen would never miss them like she did.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sure, maybe a bit. They were all close friends who barely spent days away from each other. But..not like Rio. No one would miss Agatha like herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen cleared her throat, taking a deep breath before gesturing her head to the door.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Uh, Hela asked me to send you back to the hou-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She can wait”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The three words weren’t light hearted in the slightest. Not a sliver of kindness to be offered. Hard over soft, aggressive erased gentle. There wasn’t a second hesitation either.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she said them, her eyes looked up to Agatha as if the woman made a move to earn her attention. Jen looked between them, swallowing the subtle hope arising back down the drain where it belonged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha and Rio would never sort their shit out. Sometimes, Jen wondered how Lilia could be so optimistic. It’d been years living together, having their routines, rarely going more than twenty four hours separate and for crying out loud- They raised a damn kid together!
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After all that, Jen wanted to laugh in Lilia’s face to think they’d be together one day. Especially after the dick move Rio made. If Agatha wasn’t in a hospital bed, Jen would be busy screaming in Rio’s face while having to hold Alice back. That was her favorite part about their friendship.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The group loved each other fiercely, but never sugar coated or held back their thoughts when one fucked up. They may have all been silent, not pushing Rio and Agatha to see they were more (Should they? Jen’s moral pendulum swung back and forth on that one), but when it came to situations like so?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Safe to say, Rio was in for it at some point with someone. Jen’s money was on Lilia getting to her before the rest. She’d make sure Alice’s fists wouldn’t start flying.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio, she's here” Jen softly told her, worried what reaction that’d bring and just as she expected?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio snapped her head over, eyes giving a glare Jen most certainly didn't deserve.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jesus,” Jen muttered, rolling her eyes as she looked away. “Didn't know you’d be so thrilled to see her”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio scoffed, ignoring the sarcasm in her voice as she gestured to Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She could wake up at any given moment, Jen. We both know she's going to freak, she's tried to rip out her IV's before. I need to be here with

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      Jen looked at her, wondering if Rio never heard herself speak. Truly. Did she ever analyze or comprehend what words came flying out?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They weren’t something a woman would say about their, what? Enemy? Ex-friend? Now friend?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jesus, it was too complicated to keep up with what terms the two were on.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      One moment they were close to ripping each other’s throats out, the next Agatha is sobbing for Rio to be with her in the ambulance.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, I'm not letting Hela come in. She hates us seeing her this way, let alone new people” Jen argued.
     </span>

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I said, She can wai-”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio, it'll be fine,” Jen sighed. “Agatha won't wake up. She's sleeping the pain killers off, it'll be a bit. You sitting here worrying yourself sick isn’t going to magically wake her up”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman bit on her bottom lip. Jen noticed the strength, how much pressure she applied..was she trying to bite it off?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A moment after, Rio put her hands up in surrender with a mutter under her breath,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine” She stood, turning point with a glare. “But, don’t say I didn’t tell you so if-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The beast awakens, yeah, yeah” Jen waved her hand. “Got it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio started to take a step away when she whipped back around. Jen restrained a laugh over the sight. Almost as if she was some character in Scooby-Doo dramatically turning to find the monster behind her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ri-”

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman nearly ran back over and Jen made sure to watch-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>

      Rio’s hand shook as she slowly raised it above the hospital bed railing, drifting over till her fingertips grazed the skin by the bandage. Jen’s eyes widened, jaw slacking open in disbelief.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>

      Alice and Lilia, would they even believe her when she told them Rio couldn’t go to her girlfriend without-

     <span>

      Lilia: Did she say why she didn’t want to leave her?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen was in the middle of typing how she worried Agatha would wake up in a panicked state. Something about ripping out the IV’s and-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What the fuck?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman looked up, her fingers coming to a stop as she realized the scene unfolding. A familiar one, a warning that was given to her not even ten minutes prior.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Oh no.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha lunged up, her fingers gripping the cord to yank it out of her skin. Jen cringed the way the blood gushed out with it, lunging to her feet with her phone tossed aside.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ag-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No! I’m going home”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?! No, you- Don’t you think you’re in a hospital bed for a reason, Agatha?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t give a reply. Her legs swung over the bed with the blanket toss to the side. Jen had brought her arm to wrap around her torso. But with a shocking amount of strength, the woman shoved her off and raced out of the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fuck” Jen muttered before her feet started to run. “Agatha!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman was storming down the hall, a few patients looking confused as nurses took double glances. Jen caught the eyes of a redhead who was nearly jumping over the counter, asking a strong,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Let me guess, woke up in a panicked state?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen laughed as they raced down the hall side by side.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I feel like that’s putting it lightly,” She said, turning her head as she watched her disappear around the corner. “Agatha!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Meanwhile, the hall Agatha had found herself racing down led straight to the waiting room where Hela and Rio stood. The two were in the middle of a slight argument. Hela wanted Rio to leave the hospital, head back to get some sleep and of course,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio wasn't agreeing in the slightest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I just think you need rest” Hela huffed. “Plus, we haven't spent a night together in the same bed in what? Two weeks and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before her words were able to be completely said, their attention was brought to the sound of feet running down the hall. Rio didn’t even need to double take to know exactly who it was. She felt her presence in her bones, but maybe those were just nerves.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Whatever the reasoning, Rio knew the runner incoming wasn't just a random soul.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Agatha”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman swung around the entryway to the waiting room, jumping in the middle of the hall where Agatha charged towards her. She kept her arms out on both sides, ready to catch and tackle her left to right.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But…the routine was tossed aside.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instead of needing to lunge out, Rio huffed when Agatha crashed into her. The way her arms wrapped around her torso, head buried against her chest as her knees started to cave. Before she was even able to register it, Agatha’s voice trembled a quiet sob,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They won't let me leave, Rio They won't let me-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio acted on instinct, wrapping her arms around her with one hand on the back of her head. She shushed her gently, holding her tight because if one thing was certain in Rio’s life-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha would never be allowed to fall in her hold. The woman would use all her strength before saving herself if it meant Agatha was safe.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I know,” Rio whispered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She tilted Agatha’s head up, pushing hair out of her face as their eyes connected. The tears spilling down Agatha’s cheeks punched the air from her chest, but she was quick to regain her breath.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm going back with you, okay? We'll figure out a better escape route”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They wouldn’t actually do that, deep down Agatha was well aware of it. Though knowing Rio wasn’t going to disappear from her side, it was doable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay?” Rio asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha gasped with a small nod as she stood back up, letting the woman fix her hair. She swore Rio was going to caress her cheek, wipe the tears that rolled down her cheeks, over her lips, past her chin. But, Rio revoked her touch as if Agatha didn't deserve it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wasn't sure what was worse right that second. Reality punching her in the face or panic threatening to kill.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nodded, clearing her throat before gesturing to the nurse as she slowly stepped forward.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Let her guide you, alright? I’m a step behind”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ri-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, your arm is dripping blood. I don’t mind wearing it, but I’d much rather a medical professional keep you stable”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen stepped forward, smiling softly as she nodded.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know I’ll drag Rio with us,” She said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio” Hela said, arms crossed with a complexed stare. “Let her go. They can handle her. You need sleep, and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha grasped Rio's shirt, threatening to rip holes in the fabric, burying herself as a slight whimper escaped her throat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t need to hear words to know Agatha’s unspoken plea. There was no way in hell Agatha would walk back without her. She was the rope tethered around Rio who became her anchor. There was no breaking them from the other and
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       oh
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , Rio loved it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio, let her go-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, c’mon” Rio ignored Hela completely, tilting her head to gesture down the hall. “Sooner we get back, closer you get to being out of here”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen’s eyes roamed to the woman behind them. She wasn’t blind to her annoyance, the clear worries washing over her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hell, she couldn’t blame the woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t abnormal for Rio and Agatha to act like this. Even if the moment, setting, wasn’t in a hospital- Rio was ninety-nine percent of the time always holding Agatha while the other woman remained a few steps away. Though, neither had a partner of their own back then.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Things may have stayed the same, but not in the way it used to be. It didn’t help either how Rio seemingly forgot she even had a girlfriend.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen should intervene, take control and shove Rio back to Hela. As annoying as Agatha was, Jen was protective of her. She loved Rio, but couldn’t ignore the pain inflicted from the way she left. If this only brought hopes up in Agatha for them to be crushed…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Fucking lesbians..
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Jen muttered in her mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen looked between them before ultimately deciding to hang back with Hela. On one hand, Agatha was more a guarantee to stay in a hospital bed with Rio by her side. On the other hand, maybe she could heal something, let Hela know none of this was about her because truly- It wasn’t.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      In the short span of time of knowing Hela, the woman was a gem. She held no hatred in her heart, worried about Agatha without ever meeting her. Jen didn’t want Hela thinking she did something for Rio to treat her this way.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “No, Hela. It’s not you, Rio is just too blind or chicken shit to admit she fell in love with Agatha years ago”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The words were on the tip of her tongue, so easy to say. Though, this was enough chaos and drama. They didn’t need more of that. Jen already considered herself lucky Agatha was too frazzled to register Hela behind them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Uh, Agatha- You don’t know this,” Jen started. “Her mother brought her into hospitals constantly. We aren’t entirely sure why or what happened. I think Rio knows the most out of us, but..that being said, she really only trusts Rio”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela nodded, clearly still agitated by the situation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She’s…Rio is, she cares so deeply for us” Jen added. “I don’t think she knows how to say no to-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Even after their falling out though?” Hela couldn’t refrain from asking. “I mean, Rio made it clear Agatha would never be in her life again and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen snorted, unable to hold back from the laugh before mumbling a few apologies.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha’s son is basically Rio’s,” She said. “I’m sure you’ve heard about him. For one, Nicholas is their tie. Two…we all knew they’d find their way back. Their friendship..it runs too deep to cut ties like that”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela slowly nodded, looking back as they watched the duo disappear around the corner. Jen let out a sigh of relief to see Agatha didn’t run back around. Not that Rio would ever let her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m shocked Agatha is willing to share her son. She seems…protective? From what I’ve heard”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mother Gothel,” Jen laughed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Who?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her face fell, shocked Hela didn’t know the iconic movie, but made sure to rush out the title-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tangled. Disney movie? Rapunzel? The mother who locks her daughter in their home?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh,” Hela nodded. “I’m not really into children’s movies”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen nodded, but quietly asked herself,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       How the hell- Rio is obsessed with kid movies..

     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Regardless,” Jen waved her hand. “Agatha was young, Rio moved in to help her and..Nicky just adores her. Always has, always will. We actually have a running joke Rio is his father” She chuckled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Somewhere deep down, Jen knew none of this was helping prove the case Agatha and Rio were just close friends. She couldn’t help herself and after all, it was the truth. They never became anything more than just platonic.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Like I said, when Rio cares- She’s all in”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela didn’t offer much of a reply. Just a nod with a low,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      “I’ll see you back at the house”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen watched her walk away, sighing as she grabbed her phone to call Alice to gossip about the drama unfolding. As much as she wanted peace and quiet for her wedding vacation, Jen couldn’t lie.
     </span>

      “Rio tells me you have a son back at home?”
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      The nurse smiled softly as she kept Agatha distracted with questions like such.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They had made it back in the room a few minutes prior. Rio helped ease Agatha into the bed, persuading her into letting the nurse clean her arm off instead of Rio. Not that she wouldn’t do so in a heartbeat. Rio was actually close to doing so until the nurse gave her a subtle look, telling her to let go of the reins.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When she asked the question about Nicholas, Agatha slightly glared, knowing this tactic of Rio’s far too well. Of course, she told others including the damn nurse to keep Agatha in line. Though, she never shied away from bragging about him.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I do,” She confirmed. Her glare softened as Nicky entered her mind, a tiny smile followed . “He'll be seventeen in a few weeks. Perfect son a mother could ask for”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The nurse pushed the needle back into her vein as Agatha was in the middle of speaking, her words becoming a hiss. Rio hid her smirk, finding amusement how caught off guard she had been.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well,” The woman smiled, pressing the tape down to make sure it stayed. “He's lucky to have a mother like you” She looked up, pointing as her head tilted. “That being said, listen to the doctor, and your friend here. You gotta’ get home safe to him”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sighed, rolling her eyes as she tilted her head back. The room still spiraled subtly, the ache heavy on her skull, tiredness washing over like a soft wave.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How long are you in town for?” She asked, earning Agatha’s attention again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Two weeks,” Agatha answered. “Friends wedding”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hm, well..” She smiled a bit, placing the clipboard down with a little rock on her heel. “I hope you enjoy the rest of your vacation with a ton of rest. Luckily, the concussion isn't severe. Take it easy for a few days and you’ll be back on your feet before you know it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She's too tough to break,” Rio commented.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That's an amazing quality in a woman” The nurse grinned, her eyes roaming back to Agatha’s who had snapped them to her with the compliment. “Next time you're out for a run, don't wear flip flops. You're too beautiful to be taking falls like that”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The air in the room charged a different spark. Agatha started to study the woman closer than just the annoying nurse who stabbed her with a needle. Her eyes roamed up and down, taking in every curve and how the redhead shined vibrantly under the fluorescent lighting.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t uncommon for women to flirt with Agatha, but-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      From a nurse?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When she looked her absolute worst?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      How could Agatha not find a slight amount of interest in that?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Especially when the nurse was stunning herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Besides, a tiny distraction from Rio and her new girlfriend, the one she was bound to meet after leaving the hospital, wouldn’t be a bad idea to hold onto.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Holler if you need anything, you don't have to run to get my attention”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snickered, eyes roaming up and down as she watched the woman spin around. She didn’t waste a second to catch her before she could exit the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How about your number? Can that be requested as a..need?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio scoffed the question in her mind because unlike the smirking patient on the bed- The woman beside her was furious. She forgot how strong jealousy punched her, gripped her like chains that tightened until breathing wasn’t an option.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Isn't that against the rules here? Getting personal numbers from medical staff,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha?
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ” She snarled the name, curling her upper lip in disgust.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snapped her eyes over, a silent scream to knock it off. The idea of Rio being jealous didn’t even cross her mind. After the fight hours prior, the non-existent goodbye, how she truly thought Agatha was fucking jealous of her job- Rio wasn’t jealous, she was petty.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm just asking a question,” Agatha shrugged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And so am I,” Rio snapped.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Um,” The nurse broke the tension. “No worries,” She said to Rio, looking back at Agatha with a tiny smirk. “I like my women chasing me for such things” She winked, adding on a quick, “Though, will give up my name…only for you to request my assistance- Natasha Romanoff..keep that in mind”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Shut the fuck up.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With that, the woman left the two alone. The door clicked shut behind her and Agatha huffed out a laugh before the silence lingered for too long.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ha!” Agatha grinned. “Broken and battered, women still hit on me”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s nostrils flared, fists tightened till her nails threatened to pierce the skin on her palms. She shook her head, looking around the room to avoid Agatha’s eyes of glory.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You're ridiculous,” She muttered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, honey. Don't be jealous now. I’m sure your new
     </span>
     <em>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Was it worse to be reminded she had Hela? Or was it worse watching Agatha flirt in front of her then act all smug afterwards? Both. Maybe. Either one made Rio feel irritable with rage that flamed, sparked, set fire to every inch of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I have to go,” She blurted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s smugness disappeared, shifting into the familiar worry from before. She sat up straighter as Rio turned her back to her, snatching her phone and wallet off the little table as her feet stormed out of the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wha-”

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hela is here, I have to go”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t look behind to reveal the hot tears creating a blurry wall over her eyes. She opened the door, tossing over her shoulder,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'll have Jen come in. Don't be a moron again”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her words were cold, the door that slammed shut felt violent, and Agatha was left small in the hospital bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She sank into the mattress, lips quivering as her body started to tremble. Suddenly reality was dropping on her like an atomic bomb, one after the other. She was under attack, a victim to her worst opponent.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio wasn’t hers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t

     <em>

     <span>
      her like that.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She must’ve been taking pity on her the entire time. Agatha was a burden, an obligation, a nuisance Rio took care of to ditch to the side right after.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They weren’t the duo they used to be.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Their friendship ceased to exist, a memory buried six feet under, by now decaying into dust. Agatha knew she had to collect herself the moment Jen walked in, but tears were running down her cheeks before control was an option. She’d lie about the pain in her head, but knew deep down,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio Vidal was the heartbreak of a lifetime.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She’d be the creator of her early grave. If they listed the cause of death on tombstones, Rio’s name would be in all capitals on Agatha’s. Stitches, concussion, every issue known to man would never compare.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha silently sobbed into her hand, trying to muffle the sound and prepare to collect herself the best she could once Jen opened the door. There was only one thought running through her mind. The three words she didn’t let herself say over the course of every month without her,

      The one who was usually cool, calm, laid back, all in between suddenly became the polar opposite. She knew Agatha was a..sensitive subject, to put it lightly. Rio would always shut down, barely acknowledging the name.

      She didn’t think much of that night until the last few hours. Were they just friends? Rio never spoke about them being more. Jen made it clear their friendship never progressed into something else.

     <span>
      Rio froze when the question entered her mind. Not from just the panic settling in her bones over how Hela was close to finding out Rio’s love for Agatha wasn’t platonic. But also…the hoodie in her hand was the one she wore constantly without a second thought.

     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had bought the piece of clothing for Agatha what felt like a lifetime ago and somehow it ended up back in her hands. The

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was hung up with the jackets by the door. Without a second thought, she swiped it and ran out without a look back. To Rio, if she was going to leave without a goodbye. There was no way it’d happen without a trace of Agatha in tow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>

     <span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Because, you seem more concerned about Agatha over anyone else in your life” Hela stated. “For a woman who was so adamant you two were not friends and wouldn’t speak again, you-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What was I supposed to do?” Rio whipped around, eyes wide with a tiny scoff. “Just, leave her? Act like she wasn’t hurt or-”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jen, Lilia, Alice- They are all here for her” Hela argued. “It is not on your shoulders to take care of her. Not to mention, you two did not appear to be enemies! She was crying, clinging to you. I saw it!”
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, but I know she hurt you and you said multiple times-

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela pulled her lips back, looking away to the floor, wall, up to the ceiling before Rio again. Her eyes were concerned mixed with frustration. Rio felt a pang in her chest as she read the worried look draped over her. She took in a deep breath, shaking her head as she stammered the words,
     </span>

      Rio asked herself.

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A few responses entered her mind. Ones she could never say.
     </span>

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Oh, you know, Agatha was my life”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      How was she able to explain something only she could understand? To her, Agatha didn’t even know how important Rio felt they were. No one did.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There’s a lot” She landed on, quick to add, “I borderline helped raise her son. That’s why I had to be with her to keep him updated and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Bullshit” Hela scoffed. “Lilia, Alice, Jen. They all would update him”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s heart sank to the pit of her stomach. She held the hoodie tighter in her grasp, feeling nerves thump like a bass drum through her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio,” She broke the few seconds of silence that had sat between them. “I trust you. Alright?” Hela sighed. “But, I’ll be honest”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think you need to let go,” She said. “You two aren’t the friends you were. She can live without you, vice versa. You’re both adults. If Agatha genuinely can’t handle a small injury on her own or with friends, that’s her problem. You are not responsible for her”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t look away from the hoodie in her hands. She felt heavy, weightless at the same time. The room started to spin, feeling as if she was a cartoon character being sucked into a black and white, spiraling void.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela may have thought nothing of each word. If Rio was someone else, maybe it’d be different. Realistically, she should understand Hela’s point of view. Part of her could. How would she feel watching Agatha act like that with someone else? She’d be the same as Hela.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, that didn’t matter. Logic didn’t exist. The word held no meaning, common sense was rare, all of the above when the situation was Agatha related.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She twisted from sick to furious because who was Hela to dictate what she should do? Who was Hela to tell her to stay away from Agatha? Let her go, let others take care of her, everything Rio never wanted to do.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was her responsibility, not even in a bad way. Rio always felt honored to be the one she relied on. She loved being her shoulder, her support. Agatha trusted her in the past
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       and
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      present. Rio wasn’t going to ignore and let that go.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Better yet, let

      </span>

     <span>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ri-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I need a shower” She blurted, turning on her heel to storm out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A shower would ease this. The hot water would burn on her skin, wash away the overdose of every emotion that had come back. But as she entered the bathroom, the memory of their first
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       real
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      encounter after a year punched her in the gut.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was only a few days ago and yet? Time made her feel like it was another lifetime without Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio remembered guiding Agatha to the sink. The memory alone made her almost feel the messy tangled hair on her fingertips, how her hips felt in her hold.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Even the mean eyes, the vicious words, cold voice and tone in that moment…they were close enough for Rio to feel Agatha's warmth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had taken the time to let her eyes roam up and down, scanning the woman to make sure every piece was still intact. She struggled to coherently comprehend every word Agatha spat, too busy feeling relief over the sound of her voice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She leaned against the door. Her head tilted back, eyes closed as she tried to push away tears that tried washing up to the shore. No amount of time, distance, hot water, alcohol, any vice one could be given would work.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio still loved Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio could never let go of Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And worst of all? Rio might have fucked every chance up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She left Agatha with no goodbye. She left Agatha again, but this time alone in a hospital room, knowing damn well the amount of anxiety that induced.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Maybe Hela was right, but not for her own reasons. Rio
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       should
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      let Agatha go, be free from all the pain Rio had caused. She didn't deserve to be treated this way.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then again,

      Rio covered her mouth while her muscles in her legs weakened. Slowly her body slumped till her rear hit the floor. Every blocked tear she tried to ignore greeted her without a formal hello.

      Jen snorted, leading Agatha up the stairs to the front door. She was discharged the following morning. Not only was she relieved, but Jen joked all the medical staff were beyond thankful to rid her.

      The front door opened before Jen was able to turn the knob. Lilia let out a dramatic sigh, hand over her chest as she leaned her head back,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      “Oh, thank the God who doesn’t exist!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes over the
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       very
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      unsurprising theatrics.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You're all acting I was on my deathbed”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia huffed, taking Agatha by the arm, not giving her a choice to walk on her own. Jen wiggled her fingers in the air. A silent,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Too da loo”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a playful grin, the one that she always used to torment Agatha more than she already did so.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha ignored the woman to focus on how she was being dragged into the living room. Lilia was rambling on about how her pain medication schedule was already set up, every meal would be made, and Agatha was to be in bed in the next hour-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Strict bed rest” Lilia said, guiding Agatha to sit on the couch, draping a fleece blanket over her. “I don’t want to hear any if, ands, or buts and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Lilia”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We will bring back food, souvenirs, photos if you’d like as well. Though I doubt your miserable self is heartbroken over missing out on the trip”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha felt the third blanket tucked over her arms, restraining her to the couch. When it came to the fourth one in the midst of Lilia’s rambling, she subtly kicked the woman’s ankle with a low,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Woman, you’re going to send me back there from suffocation or a damn heat stroke if you add on one more blanket”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia paused with the fleece blanket held in the air. She leaned back, eyes roaming over her work before whispering a small,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shoot”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s smirk barely lifted her lips, but before she could say anything- A snort on the other side of the room was heard. An all too familiar one that always brought warmth to her blankets never could.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She’s right, Lilia,”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio casually said, stepping into the room with her arms crossed against her chest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Besides…the cold hearted can’t be warmed up even if they were in an oven”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The words might’ve come off harsh, but the tiny smirk on her lips, how her eyes roamed over Agatha like a scanner- The older woman knew she meant no harm. There was no malicious intent in her voice. The stare was a familiar scan to make sure she was safe.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that your next plan?” Agatha asked, stretching her limbs when Lilia removed all the blankets, giving her a choice if she wanted any. “Take off with no goodbye, bake me in an oven?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia rolled her eyes, shooting glares between the two.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Eh, your taste wouldn’t fill my appetite” Rio smirked, plopping down in the loveseat chair. The one that sat beside the opposite end of the couch. “I’d need plenty more of you” She winked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looked down, desperate to hide the shade of red in her cheeks. She felt the familiar sensation as if she was pressing her skin to the sun itself. When in reality, it only took a few words, the presence of Rio alone to burn her like fire.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       I’d like plenty more of you.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The words replayed in her mind, over and over, like a broken record player she wasn’t able to repair.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      In another world, a different timeline, Agatha dreamt of having the ability to reply with the words that lived on the tip of her tongue. The same variation of a reply when the familiar banter came up time and time again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “I’d let you have all of me”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wanted to say it. Agatha almost did as a quick
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fuck it
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . What would be the damage? She never saw Rio again? Ultimately that was the end result of all this.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Two weeks, barely that with how she had to remain low. Agatha wouldn’t be on the trips they took. She'd be buried in bed and, oh god, was she thankful for it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’d-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s dream reply was cut off by the sound of a low whistle. A tall woman with dark black hair turned the corner. She had one hand on her hip while the other moved to rest on the back of the loveseat Rio resided in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It only took a few seconds for Agatha to piece together who the mystery woman was. Even with a concussion, the stitches in her skin, it wasn’t rocket science to figure it out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Hela.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You must be Agatha”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shifted uncomfortably. She tilted her chin up, shoulders tightened with her stare fierce to come off strong.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Depends who’s asking” She said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia watched closely. A hawk above, keeping an eye on her target in case she needed to swoop in to snatch her away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, she stayed quiet. Even as Agatha’s body stiffened, her voice became cold, every inch of the space around her felt violent. Lilia knew to let it play out. Give the floor for Agatha and Rio to navigate.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If Rio wanted to bring her girlfriend into this. If she wanted to bring Hela into this mess the two created, so be it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The name is Hela,” She introduced. “Rio’s told me much about you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh,” Agatha perked up in her seat, eyes switching over to Rio. A warning glance filled with curiosity, “Bad things, I presume?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela chuckled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Little bit of this, that-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And the other thing?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What other thing?” Rio asked, eyebrows furrowed, struggling to figure out Agatha’s game.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice jumped in the room before she could reply- Lilia would thank her endlessly for doing so. Even if it wasn't intentional.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha as well was thankful because truly, that was no game. The question was meaningless. A poor attempt at shutting Hela up before she could go on any longer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t want to know what Rio was saying about her. She imagined the worst. It’d only make sense after the way she left her. If Rio thought she was genuinely jealous of her job, life, God knows what else-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       What did you tell her?
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’ll never beat my record at concussions, Harkness” Alice ran a hand through her damp hair, fresh out of the shower. “No matter how hard you try”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen followed behind, rolling her eyes with a monotone,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes because having bragging rights over who has the most head injuries is an astounding accomplishment”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman sat on the opposite end of the couch, Alice plopped on the floor with her back against Jen’s legs behind her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, don’t be jealous you aren’t in our cool head blows club”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio and Agatha’s laugh was unintentionally in sync. Their noses scrunched in sync, heads fell to the side as they tried to cover the sound.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      To the other three, it was normal. Agatha and Rio mirrored each other from day one. Lilia always said they were two intertwined souls that shared the same heartbeat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, Hela was new. She picked up on it within a second. Her glare sharpened, worries lifted higher than before.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” Alice asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That sounded,” Rio took a breath, cackling out another laugh. “So wrong, dude!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my god” Lilia muttered, pinching the bridge of her nose as she shook her head. “Children, the both of you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen shrugged when Alice looked up behind her, silently asking for confirmation if they were right. She smirked a bit herself, mostly from how Agatha and Rio weren’t arguing or being cold to one another again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Head blows!” Alice exclaimed. “It’s the actual fucking meaning! Google it, right now. It’ll come up and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She then caught herself, repeating the two words under her breath before slumping back against Jen’s legs. Her head tilted up, eyes narrowed, flickering little glares back and forth to both of them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re both disgusting for even going there” Alice muttered. “We are not a club of blow jobs or giving head-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Depends on the person” Agatha shrugged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And the equipment you’re working with,” Rio added.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright!” Lilia exclaimed, pointing between the both of the duo who were laughing hysterically. “That- Okay, knock it off, the two of you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, boo” Rio curled her lip up in mockery while Agatha rolled her eyes along with her. “You’re all so boring”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And you two are middle school thirteen year old boys” Jen said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha put her finger up, tilting her head back with a smile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, one of us is raising a teenager. I’m pretty certain that explains my-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, you’ve been like this since the day we met” Alice snickered. “Hell, the both of you have been this way. I’m sure it’s one of the reasons you’ve been glued to each other’s hip for years. Not a single soul can tolerate either of you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice bit her bottom lip back, feeling the atmosphere in the air shift, silently cursing herself out for not carrying a filter. However, it wasn’t entirely her fault. She was the one to always make jokes about the two.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The way they were laughing together, how Jen told them Agatha was begging for Rio at the hospital, Alice completely forgot the duo had cut ties.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

       Oops.

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s smile faded as she looked down to her phone. On the other side of the room, Rio cleared her throat, rolling her head to stretch her neck. A nervous tick she carried since childhood.
     </span>
    </p>

      Lilia had taken note of Rio’s response, body language. How her reaction seemed stronger than Agatha’s. Which was…shocking, to say the least.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice was hiding her face, feeling awkward for the tension she created. Lilia was monitoring the situation and as for Jen? She seemingly didn’t have a care for the way the conversation would turn again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If anything, she was giddy to add onto it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So,” Jen wiggled her eyebrows with a devious grin. “Anyone want to take a guess as to what Agatha achieved before being discharged?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh for fucks-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groaned, shaking her head while her hand moved to cover half of her face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jen” Agatha sighed. “I swea-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What? Don't be embarrassed!” Jen exclaimed. “Hell, this is what we've been pushing you to do for, I don't know,
     </span>
     <em>

      now?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman sitting on the floor nearly jumped out of her skin. She whipped around, eyes wide with a strong gasp.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No,” Alice dramatically drew the word out, letting it roll off her tongue slowly to annoy Agatha even more. “Did you get a chick's number?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       What?

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio froze, an impending doom weighed upon her. She glared straight at Agatha, but the older woman was too busy covering her face, sending little daggers at the giggling duo beside her. They had replaced Agatha and Rio’s antics for their own. Lilia was gobsmacked herself, eyes bulged while her jaw slacked open ajar.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She did,” Lilia said in a low voice, placing a hand over her chest. “My, my…I never thought I'd see the day!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The rest were busy gasping, laughing, parading her with congratulations and relentless questions. Except for Rio. She felt her fists clenching into small balls of fury. Her jaw clenched, almost locking itself for eternity. This felt worse than sitting in the hospital room while Agatha flirted with that nurse.
     </span>

      Rio never knew she could despise a name so much. It was disgusting, annoying, frustrating, and-

     <span>
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>

      “The nurse” Jen answered Alice's question. “The Hot One too-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Like, how hot- What are we-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Another redhead” Jen winked, looking over to Agatha who was a bat covering her entire being with her wings. “Agatha seemingly likes ‘em spicey now”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice belted out a laugh, leaning forward with a clap of her hands.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my god! The reds are crawling on their knees for Agatha Har-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you have a thing for redheads now?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio snapped. Her voice was brutal, attitude laced through each syllable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The room fell silent like before. Eyes moved to lock on Rio who’s body slumped into the chair. She swiped her tongue on the inside of her cheek, knee beginning to bounce while she shrugged her shoulders. A little laugh that barely sounded humorous was the poor attempt to cover up her anger.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not even Rio could convince herself the pathetic attempt at humor was realistic.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her friends eyes being on her were one thing. But as Rio felt the glare on her skull from Hela, the previous conversation from the night before still lingered above them- Rio’s words didn’t help. Not in the slightest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Still none of it compared to the sight across the room. Agatha uncovered her face, eyes gawking right into Rio’s soul. She looked confused and
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fuck,
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Rio was too. Not confused as to why she reacted that way, but she actually verbalized it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For an emotion that Rio thought she mastered hiding. Ones to never be seen nor heard suddenly broke out in the open for all, including Agatha, to see. It was out in the open for
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       all
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      to hear, see, experience themselves.

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had to save herself, cover this, shift the attention back on Agatha and off of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They're just…intense,” Rio shrugged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice snickered, smirking with a shrug herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So is Agatha” She pointed out. “You would know after years of-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen pushed her knee forward, nudging it into the woman’s spine to refrain her from not using a filter again. Sure, she helped explode the situation into something else. But, it still had to be at a lower level somehow. Especially from how Agatha was staring wide at Rio, unable to look away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And Hela? Jen once again felt bad for the woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Movie night?” Lilia asked, desperate to snap the tension in the air. “I’m thinking-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Actually,” Rio interrupted, standing to her feet as she stretched her back and limbs. “We'll be back tonight”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” Alice asked. “It's movie night!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And we will be back for half of it,” Rio assured. “Going out for drinks”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela hummed, crossing her arms tight against her chest while standing herself, nudging her shoulder against Rio’s.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Little way

     <em>

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ah, make up sex. Got it” Alice clicked her tongue.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The same jerk reaction kicked up from Agatha’s stomach to her throat. She held her breath, swallowing down the hurls of vomit that wanted to escape from her body.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm going to head up, actually,” Agatha said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?! Again, movie night!” Alice whined.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha forced a laugh when Lilia jumped to her feet to hold her arm while she stood. Silently, she was thankful for it. Not only was the concussion making her feel off balance, but the thought of Rio being with someone else, the reality of it before her? That made her sicker than a concussion held the ability to.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I shouldn't even be looking at screens. Or anyone. Or anything. Google it, concussions should be in a room that's pitch black” Agatha argued. “Now that I think of it, this may be the perfect injury I’ve ever gifted myself”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen rolled her eyes, muttering under her breath while Agatha walked out of the room with Lilia in tow,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Now she wants to acknowledge the concussion” Jen muttered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice snickered, pushing up to sit on the couch beside her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, come on, babe,” She said, reaching for the remote on the coffee table. “I try to ignore mine, but ultimately sitting up for as long as she’s been- I’m shocked she made it this far without vomiting”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s eyes were magnets to the staircase. Lilia stood behind Agatha with a hand on her lower back, the other out to catch her if she fell. That wouldn’t save her completely. Agatha would easily send Lilia flying back with her, but the gesture of extra care was there.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio hated the feeling in her stomach. She thought about how Agatha would’ve been carried against her wishes up the stairs. How she would’ve insisted on skipping the couch, heading straight to bed to seclude her in the darkness. She’d even make some small joke that’d make the woman groan,
     </span>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Lilia and Agatha disappeared upstairs, Rio was unable to rip her eyes away. She wished to be Medusa, one stare would turn them into stone so Agatha didn’t leave her eyesight. While taking off from the hospital was vital, a survival tactic to make sure Agatha didn’t see her jealousy. She didn’t get a minute of slumber.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not having Agatha before her, unable to listen to the heart monitor, make sure she wasn’t too upset or nearly killing the medical staff- Rio couldn’t stomach not knowing if Agatha was safe.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      “Let’s get out of here,” Hela rubbed her arm, head gesturing to the door with a soft smile. “Like I told you, they’ve-”

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stormed for the front door, cutting Hela’s words how the rest would take care of Agatha because for the millionth time-
     </span>

     <span>
      The following week had gone by far too fast for Agatha’s liking. It had been a blessing to hide away in bed, only force her energy up when it was morning and nightly phone calls with Nicholas.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn’t have to go on adventures with the others. More than anything, watch Rio and Hela be all gross and up one another’s ass. Agatha never thought she'd be thankful for falling on concrete, but here she was, thanking her skull for taking a fall.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha..” Lilia sighed. “We gotta’ get a move on”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She crossed her arms, leaning against the dining room doorway while Agatha was sitting at the table with her head in her hands.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The pancakes in front of her were left untouched. Not because she wasn’t feeling better. She had taken her rest so seriously to the poiny her head was feeling a million times better. The dizziness went away, the pain was less, the only thing left was occasionally feeling sick. But, that was definitely Rio related. Even if she didn’t want to admit to it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her breakfast wasn't devoured like usual because of what the morning plans were. Lilia had volunteered to take one for the team, and bring Agatha back to the hospital for her stitches to be removed. Jen joked she was signing her death certificate, Alice making sure Lilia was up for the challenge which ultimately resulted in a rant of,

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And so, the others backed off with no fuss. Well, besides Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had gone up to Lilia, asking relentlessly if she needed to pass Agatha off to her. Lilia considered it, but truthfully didn’t know if Agatha would be up to it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She watched the way Hela and Rio going for drinks killed her. The woman knew Agatha was thankful to hide in bed from Rio. As much as Lilia wanted to push the two together, she had to monitor Agatha's well being as well.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The initial hospital ride was one thing. It was unexpected, Agatha was shaken up. With her thoughts more collected, coherent- Sure, her anxiety was present. That much was clear, but now Lilia didn’t know if Rio was back to being off limits. There was no way she was taking a chance.

      “You should be excited to get the stitches out!” Lilia exclaimed. “You’re feeling ten times better and the sooner those are gone, the sooner this is farther behind us”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sighed, shaking her head as she looked up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can’t we just..DIY it? I’m sure there’s a YouTube tutorial or-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The little snicker from behind had cut Agatha’s ridiculous idea off before it was completed. Rio placed her breakfast down on the table, pulling the chair out to sit across from Agatha while spewing a monotone,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, Nicky. Your idiot mother YouTubed how to take her own stitches out. Oh, what’s that? You think she made things worse? Well, you’ve always been a smar-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shut. Up.” Agatha glared, pronouncing each word with annoyance behind them. “You make me miss being locked in my room”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio gasped, a hand over her heart with a little smile,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Aweee! I make you miss something? What else about me do you miss, huh?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Everything.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman’s taunt was normal, but Agatha felt pained by it more than she had before. The word screamed in her mind, begging to be released. She couldn’t let the truth escape into the open. Rio had a girlfriend, a new life, left without a goodbye. It was clear she didn’t care. Not like Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Little did she know on the other end of the table, Rio was masking her own pain. Chanting softly to herself,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Tell me you miss me..please.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was sure Agatha didn’t miss any piece of her. The hospital trip was a fluke, something in the heat of the moment. She now had a new woman in her life. One that would replace the spot Rio left vacant.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Good morning,”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela greeted, cutting off the banter before it could ever truly begin. Both were silently thankful for it. Agatha of course barely could feel at ease for more than two seconds with Hela near. When she was next to Rio, the spot Agatha used to have reserved for her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       That should be me, bitch.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Some of her wished she bashed her head hard enough to forget what Rio ever meant to her. Maybe they'd somehow mess up with the stitches. Could memory loss happen from that? Agatha hoped they'd find a way to make the impossible happen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What's the plan for today?” She sat next to Rio, plucking a strawberry off her plate.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, Agatha and I have a trip of our own,” Lilia said. “We will join you all for lunch right after. As for where Jen is dragging you all off to, I believe it's a surprise”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio snickered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There's your reason to go” She said through a mouthful of food, gesturing at Agatha with her fork. “Not the stitches, Jen's surprise”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha truly fucking hated that she was right. Surprises were not her forte, especially when they included Rio's pathetic new girlfriend by her side.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For the first time in Agatha's life, a medical procedure sounded more ideal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are her surprises not good?” Hela asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They are,” Lilia assured.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha hates surprises,” Rio explained. A little snicker followed as she looked up to Lilia. “Remember when she almost killed us for the surprise party for her
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       dirty thirty
      </span>

     <span>
      ”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groaned while Lilia belted out a laugh over the memory.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Who wants a surprise party for their thirtieth, let alone at all!” She exclaimed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I mean,” Hela shrugged. “I’d be flattered to be gifted a surprise party”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looked over, tilting her head to the side with a warm smile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Noted”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia’s smile faded as her eyes roamed to Agatha who could have physically had steam blowing out of her ears. She knew it was time to leave. Not because they’d be late, but more so to save Agatha's- No,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Hela’s
      </span>

     <span>
      life.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come on,” She gestured. “We’re taking an Uber. Jen just texted it’s about to be outside”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman was going to take the rental car, but ultimately decided against it. Maybe Agatha would feel more inclined to go if they didn't have a quick escape car once they were there.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Plus, grand theft auto of a rental car? Lilia didn’t feel like putting up with that charge. Explaining to Nicky his mother went to prison to avoid getting stitches wouldn’t be shocking to him, but that boy would lose his damn mind more than Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha reluctantly stood up and let her feet trudge from the table. Rio had said something about taking her leftovers, but Agatha barely registered it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She focused on avoiding Hela, using it as ammunition to eliminate her fears to step out the door. But just as she was about to exit the dining room, she heard the soft voice behind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha..” Rio said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She turned slowly, hesitation maxed out within her. Agatha pulled her bottom lip back when Rio gave her a little smirk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t kill anyone”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed, trying to hide the red in her cheeks and grin on her lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t tell me what to do,” She snarled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio paused before scoffing with a slight grin, stabbing the pancake like it did something personal to her. Not from taking offense over the words, but because of what they did. How she felt the familiar flutter in her chest, warmth spread over her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She’s such a bitch, Rio,” Hela muttered under her breath, snapping Rio out of her daze. “Why do you put up with it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Truthfully, Rio had forgotten Hela was right beside her. As an outsider herself, of course she didn’t hear the tone correctly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wasn’t actually being her horrific, cruel, self. No. This was like old times when they’d banter, insult, appear to be at odds. But in reality, the remark, demand, it was…well, Agatha.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>

     <span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Because..”
     </span>
    </p>

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s Agatha,” She shrugged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh?” Hela asked. “Again, do I need to be wor-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Good morning, losers!” Alice beamed,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio turned, thankful the topic from the night before was silenced before it cycled back to them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She watched Alice round the table with a snicker.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You reek of
     </span>
     <em>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice laughed at Rio's tease, taking the seat Agatha had been in not three minutes prior. Rio loved Alice, she did. But the sight wasn’t as nice as Agatha. That was for sure.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What? The

     <em>

     <span>
      suddenly a prune against premarital sex?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That must be the answer” Hela commented before taking a sigh, getting up with something about needing to take a shower.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t freeze. She didn’t take a second to turn around, follow, pay attention to the glare and sharp words that Hela had given her. If it were Agatha, Rio would’ve been out of her seat with fire under her ass to figure out what was wrong.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But in this case? Alice watched her as she couldn’t care less. She continued eating, smirking over the humor between them, acting as if her girlfriend didn't have any issues at all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What was that about?” Alice asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman looked up, eyebrows furrowed as the word was muffled through food.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That,” Alice gestured. “She was giving you a cold ass glare, the comment about lesbian death bed, and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh,” Rio shrugged. “It’s fine,”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That was a complete lie. Rio knew well they were on the verge of a break up because like every other short lived relationship-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was the one to destroy it. The complete, total, sole reason simply because Rio didn’t know how to not love her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice slowly nodded, muttering under her breath a low,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right..” She cleared her throat, sitting up to grab the fork off the plate. “Agatha didn’t eat, did she?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m shocked Lilia was able to get her out the door” Rio shrugged. “Though,” She chewed, swallowing her food down before pointing her fork at Alice. “Lilia still has the journey to complete and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, yeah, where are you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen flew through the room with the phone attached to her ear, frantic movements that made the two both share a worried stare before shooting from their chairs to follow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They found Jen struggling to get her shoes on, stumbling as she ended the phone call.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What’s going on?” Alice asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen sighed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha jumped out of the car, luckily at a redlight. She’s having a panic attack, Lilia’s trying to keep up so I’m going to-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio flew into action without a thought. She grabbed her boots, slipping them on while finding the rental car keys that sat on the entryway table.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice flickered her eyes over, subtly gesturing for Jen to catch on to the woman behind her. Jen sighed, annoyed that Alice was interrupting her, but took a double glance when she caught on to the sight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>

      “Rio. What are you doing?”

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What does it look like?” She asked. “Told Lilia this was a bad idea for me to not take her. Jesus. Get an Uber today, I’m taking the car”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, you aren’t-”

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The front door opened and slammed shut, Rio’s figure running down the porch steps. Jen lifted her hand, finishing the previous words under her breath,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Going…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The other woman scoffed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are we surprised?” She asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No..guess not” Jen shrugged. “But, this..it’s good, right?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice shrugged, gesturing upstairs with her head as she whispered,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not for one of us…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen caught on, nodding slowly as she sighed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Poor girl,” She muttered. “How many relationships until Rio catches on none of them will work as long as she-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I know, I know” Alice repeated, making sure Hela wasn’t on the stairs in earshot. “I have a feeling they’ll…we’re close. We have to be”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We say that each and every time!” She exclaimed in a strong whisper. “What will it take for them to realize-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Trust me, babe. Lilia and I talked about it last night. We...it’s a feeling”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen shook her head, tossing the bag down, kicking her shoes off before falling into Alice’s arms. She held her tight, whispering under her breath,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just want our life back to normal”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice chuckled.

     <span>
      Rio sped down the road, eyes searching everywhere to find Agatha. It wouldn’t be that hard, she figured. Sure, Los Angeles was a chaotic city. But, finding a hysterical sobbing walking panic attack Agatha wouldn’t be that hard..right?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Wrong.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The streets were covered in families, couples, screaming and giggling children, all of the above. Rio silently cursed Jen’s love of summer. She was adamant their vacation, wedding, fell right smack dab in the middle of tourist season.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She tried to calm herself down from her own panic. Definitely not as strong as Agatha’s, but still enough to make her brain scattered and worries spiral into one big mess.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      What if she didn’t find her? That was her main concern. Agatha was never in her right mind during panic attacks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She remembered losing her for almost an entire night when Nicky took off from their campsite. They ended up finding him stuck in a tree. Agatha tried climbing it with no sense of balance. Rio almost saw her life flash before her eyes when she found the woman half up the tree.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       God, please don’t be somewhere like that again.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And with the recent injury? Agatha running to the point her head smacked on the pavement? She was fortunate for walking out with only a concussion, a wound that only needed five stitches. Rio worried this time would be worse.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fucks sake, Agatha..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The muttered words must’ve been a spell that summoned her. Rio perked up, seeing Agatha speed down the sidewalk. She had her arms tucked over her stomach. A sign she was close to becoming sick in the middle of public (Which would only send Agatha into a deeper spiral).
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio swung the car, almost hitting the curb and driving onto the sidewalk. She didn’t bother to turn the engine off, almost forgetting to put it in park while jumping out of the vehicle.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She expected the woman to run from her. Though luckily, Agatha stopped.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Thank fuck.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman spun on her heel, eyes wide and puffed a burning red with tears. Rio could see the hiccups from afar, how her body was trembling, and
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fuck-
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      It broke her heart into pieces.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stormed over, a hand up just above her hip. A silent gesture she was coming in peace. She wouldn’t be like the others who aggressively demanded for her to go. Rio always gently gave Agatha room to breathe.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey,” She whispered when they were only two steps apart. “Did you sign up for your own marathon or what?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Humor with Agatha was always key. She barely remembered a time Agatha didn’t make jokes over something. It was her survival instinct, her way of coping when things were tough.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was gasping, short breaths that only made things worse. A few hiccups made her jump, shaking her head as she tried to break the words out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I- I’m,” A hiccup. “I’m not-” Another hiccup. “Rio, I can’t-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As cute as her little hiccups were to Rio, she couldn’t keep letting her speak.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With hesitation, Rio lifted her hands to place over Agatha’s arms. She took them off her stomach, barely applying any strength to let Agatha push her off if needed. The woman never did.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instead her eyes locked deep into Rio’s, letting her guide every movement. Agatha was a puppet while Rio held the strings.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Others would never believe how quick control freak Mother Gothel, strict being Agatha Harkness, gave up her power. She let Rio take her completely without a fight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio Vidal was the only woman Agatha would ever trust with her entire life. No matter what happened, the divide between them, that never changed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Breathe..” Rio whispered. “Look at me, we’re going to breathe together, yeah?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It took a moment, but Agatha subtly nodded to agree. Consent was always vital when Rio took control. She knew the woman like her plants, her science, and all the music she loved. Sometimes Rio thought she knew Agatha better than her own self.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      People thought Agatha was a psycho who thrived off control. But Rio knew, that wasn’t the case. After being raised by a woman like Evanora Harkness, living the life she was forced to. It only made sense for Agatha to need authority over her life.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, good,” Rio nodded. “Follow my count, ready?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She slowly moved her left hand off Agatha’s arm. Trading the space to rest on her abdomen, right above her belly button. Agatha was known to take deep breaths from her chest and that never truly brought her down from the heights of anxiety hell.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her touch was Rio’s way of making sure Agatha took the steps necessary. She was silently thankful Agatha didn’t swat her hand, allowing her access to help entirely.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Inhale, from your gut. Not your chest”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She instructed, more so reminded Agatha from how many times the words were told before.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “On three-” Rio wasted no time, jumping into the count. “One, two three-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They took a deep inhale in sync. Rio felt the woman’s stomach slightly raise her hand. It was a struggle to do so, but Rio gave Agatha some grace instead of telling her she did it wrong.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The attempt was there, Agatha was trying, and that’s what truly mattered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hold till five” She instructed. “One..two..three..four…five- K’, let go”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She felt the subtle touch of cool air that came from Agatha. Rio tried to hold back the way her own body shivered as it always did when Agatha touched her in any way, shape or form.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my god, there you are!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia’s tired voice came from behind. Agatha jumped, looking down to hide the mess of emotions all over her. Rio tilted her head around Agatha, eyes telling Lilia it was all alright.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Let the girls know where you are. They’re about to head out” Rio said. “They’ll grab you along the way. Don’t waste energy walking all the way back”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia scoffed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For the millionth, billionth, time! I am not that old”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio snickered, but it was cut short when she felt Agatha’s hand slither over the top of her own. She took in another deep breath on her own. Rio thanked the universe a million times over for it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Whatever you say,” Rio shrugged. “We’re gonna’ head out”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha tensed, but Rio’s grasp on her arm gave a reassuring squeeze.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia walked up, not caring if she made Agatha jump. Even though deep down, Agatha held a special spot for Lilia as well.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman became a mother figure of sorts in her life. After she learned a bit about Evanora, Lilia didn’t hesitate to take Agatha under her wing. Not that she would if she didn’t know a single thing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She reached up, rubbing her upper back soothingly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No murder charges, no assault, for the love of God do not take anyone hostage” Lilia groaned.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha tried to keep her face stern, but a tiny grin grew on her lips with a little snort from her nose.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And you,” Lilia pointed at Rio. “No being a partner in crime to this one”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio scoffed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m always her sidekick” She rolled her eyes. “Batman needs her Robin, no?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was an old joke between them. Nicky had created it when he was around the age of eight. One Halloween he begged the two to dress up and go trick or treating with him. Typically, Rio took him while Agatha stayed home to grade papers while the house was silent. Back when she was an English teacher at the local high school.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That night, the two changed their routine. It was Rio's idea to let the boy pick out their costume. She vividly remembered him running up through the Halloween store. Two costumes in his tiny hands, a wide grin as he exclaimed,

      From that point on, they joked they were that exact duo. Not even time apart would make either forget the joke.

    <p>
     <span>
      She took Agatha by the hand, the other pressed on her hip. Surprisingly, no fight was given as Agatha slithered into the passenger seat. Rio closed the door behind her, looking over at Lilia who mouthed a wide,

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smirked, shrugging her shoulders.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Told you so”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, shut it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman snickered, saying she'd keep her updated before getting into the driver's seat. Agatha didn't say anything and Rio wouldn't force her. That left the trip being driven in silence. Only the soft music played underneath it, but neither truly heard it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Close to fifteen minutes later, Rio pulled into the hospital's parking lot. She was thankful the trip was short lived, but knew to Agatha- It either felt like a lifetime or far too short.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She turned the engine off, unbuckling herself before looking over at the frozen woman by her side.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ag..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don't”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her voice was short, sharp like a blade in hopes to cut Rio off before she could continue. Not that it'd work.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come on,” Rio took in a deep breath, exhaling the exhausted sigh right after. “Let's just…walk in, yeah? I won't force you to do anything”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sniffled, shaking her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But you'll use Nicky and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That isn't even for you, Agatha. I use him because he doesn't deserve you pushing off your own wellbeing” Rio said. “He needs you, so I use that
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       wonderful
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman knew she was right. Rio was
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       always
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      right in these situations. She'd kill her one day for it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Besides, he told me your whole lecture on returning home to

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “God,”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha huffed, aggressively unbuckling while whipping the door open, clearly fed up with being near Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah. You'd know the definition of hypocritical better than I would, huh?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She jumped out, slamming the door with force that shook the vehicle. Rio slowly looked away, muttering under her breath,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jesus..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      In any other circumstance, Rio would fly out of the car with a comeback of her own. Part of her wanted to. She felt whiplash every few minutes this entire trip. Not only with Agatha, but with herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio found her mind back in the Airbnb with Agatha as they traveled. She wondered if the woman was getting rest, worried about her falling again or not eating enough. Then in the same breath, she’d feel resentment and rage over what happened. The flirting with the nurse, the way Agatha ignored every call, text, email after she left.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      God, it was all such a shitshow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She forced herself to get out of the car, locking it behind while catching up to Agatha who froze on the sidewalk all over again. Rio washed the frustration away, going back to the person Agatha needed her to be in that moment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, she couldn’t help from a tiny quip of her own,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s a rental. Careful with the theatrical exits,

     <em>

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scrunched her nose, lips curled as she looked over with a mocking stare.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio snorted at the weak impression of her. It was cute, reassuring as well to know
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       her
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Agatha was still there. Even if she was buried under the layers of panic.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She rolled her eyes, reaching out to hold Agatha’s hand as if they weren’t on the verge of an argument. And the way Agatha attached, intertwined their fingers together? It almost felt as if the woman wanted to ignore their drama as well.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A tiny splinter of hope sparked in Rio like a lightbulb above her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Will she want to reconcile after this?
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      No. Rio could not allow herself to think that way. Not now, not ever.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The damage was done, they were over. This medical situation was all a fluke. She didn’t know what Agatha would do if they were across the country from one another. But what Rio did know?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was going to disappear from her life as if she never trusted Rio to be her savior.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio took every step ahead of her. She drew mindless shapes and letters with her thumb over Agatha’s knuckles. Agatha would sporadically squeeze her hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The grip around her hand, pressure against her fingers, the warmth of their skin together, Rio tried to not let the feeling go to her head. She needed to be focused on getting Agatha through this, survive the wedding, and go their separate ways.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hi,” Rio greeted the receptionist. “Agatha Harkness for ten o’clock”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The check in went smooth which Rio felt a giant weight off her shoulders over. If there was ever an issue, a bump in the road, Agatha was prone to jumping ship. Though, they still had to wait in the waiting room, the stitches to be removed. Rio sighed in her mind, muttering a silent,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       This is going to be a long morning..
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chose a spot tucked away from others. One of the uncomfortable chairs without the armrest in between. She debated giving Agatha her own spot, but ultimately found it safer if nothing came between them. Even a wooden bar that could easily be snapped in half seemed like a heavy barrier.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Silence sat between them for a few moments. The sound of low chatter, fuzzy TV that had Wheel Of Fortune on the quietest volume possible filled the void. Rio always wondered why waiting rooms kept them silent.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Weren’t they supposed to be a distraction for people like Agatha?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Their hands were still intertwined while Rio used her free one to shoot a small text, updating Lilia they had made it in the room. She knew the woman would update the others. A group chat would be too much to deal with when the panic woman was beside her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Especially when Rio was caught off guard with the bomb that disrupted their silence. A question that felt like a catch twenty-two, one with no right answer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why are you here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Rio froze, her thumb hovering over the keyboard, eyes locked on the screen as she thought over the four words. Someone else must’ve asked another person. There was no way in the midst of hysteria, pure fear, Agatha wanted to talk about this
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       now.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then again, she was the one to bring them up in the ambulance. But she had bashed her head then. Rio chalked it up to her not being in her right mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      How long had she been silent? Rio didn’t know. It was enough for Agatha to start to pull her hand away, mumbled words she most likely thought Rio didn’t hear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Forget it”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman struggled to find an answer. Now finding herself in her own state of panic, possibly would surpass Agatha if this conversation would go in the direction she feared.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What do you mean?” She asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha puffed out a bit of air from her nose. She rolled her neck to the right, meeting Rio’s confused eyes with a lazy, tired, smile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know what I mean, idiot,” She muttered. “You hate me-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” Rio turned her body to face her completely. “I- You think I hate-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You think I’m fucking jealous of your job, life. That’s definitely a reason to hate someone” Agatha argued.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio frowned, Agatha’s smile dropped into a mirror of Rio’s frown as well.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No..” She whispered. “Agatha, you-” Rio pulled her lips back between her teeth, lightly biting down on them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The three words on the tip of her tongue, but felt impossible as always to say. Years had gone by and Rio never found the guts to confess them. How could she gather the courage to do so when they were in a waiting room?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She slumped back in her chair, looking away from the woman glaring into her. Rio earned herself many glares during her lifetime, but Agatha’s? Those had to be the coldest pair of blue eyes to exist. How Rio didn’t freeze into an icicle on the spot, she’d never know.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The day I hate you will never exist. How could it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t reply. The glare was shifted off of her, Rio silently thanked her for it. She was able to breathe easier that way. Though, her gratefulness only lasted a few seconds when she heard the tiny sniffle beside her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s head snapped over, eyes wide, ready to pull Agatha off of the cliff's edge. Then she realized, it wasn’t that. The way Agatha squeezed her hand, slithering it out of her grasp a second after. How her body leaned to her left, collecting distance as much as she could between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Suddenly, the reasoning for Agatha's madness wasn’t the environment. Not because she was about to get stitches out of her skin. No.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You left without-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah, I fucking did”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio huffed, her words short as her body stiffened. She suddenly hated that they were in public with others surrounding them. If it were just the two in one room, a space of their own, a little secluded spot for them to exist with one another- Rio would let it rip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She’d strain her voice with regret, jump to her feet, scream how tired she was of this conversation. The argument that divided them both. A doomed situation Rio was the creator of. Her own personal hell designed and crafted by her
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       for
      </span>

     <span>
      her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instead, all she could do was clench her jaw, fists tightening to the point nails dug into her skin. She shook her head, taking in a deep breath to try and ground herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sorry. Okay? I- You will never know the fucking regret I hold for that. I wasn’t thinking, it’s why I tried desperately to call, but you never-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed, the glare returning on Rio’s skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why the hell would I talk to you after you left like that, Rio?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe to ask why the fuck I did that”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, so that’s on me?” Agatha asked. “Maybe you should have offered explanation”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How the fuck could I when you were blocking, ignoring, telling everyone and their mother to leave you alone?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No” Agatha shook her head, laughing in disbelief as she looked away, pointing at her with a wave of her finger. “That isn’t fair and you know it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio muttered curse words under her breath before jumping out of her seat. She stormed over to the chair across from Agatha. There were only a few steps in between them, but still- It gave her some space from her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh lookie,” Agatha sneered. “The runaway is off aga-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you not see me sitting here?” Rio asked. “Or are you just that ignor-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ignorant or ignoring? It seems you
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       love
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      the second word”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman belted out a laugh that earned her a few stares from others in the room. She didn’t care to acknowledge any of them. Rio was too busy fighting to keep her eyes with Agatha’s, never looking away, determined to stand her ground and win whatever this argument was.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Seems you
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       love
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      not comprehending the definition of ignoring- You know, for a woman who calls me hypocritical..” Rio perked up, leaning forward in her seat. “And yet..you can’t own up to how your side including ignoring as well”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha took in a sharp inhale, her jaw tightened to the point it’d lock shut forever if she continued. She shook her head, muttering through gritted teeth,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You. Fucking. Left.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m. Fucking. Sorry.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The two didn’t add any other words, but their eyes stayed glued to each other, desperate to talk like they used to. Their entire lives spent together, unspoken words at times were their language.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They’d find each other’s gaze across the room at parties, silently agreeing to leave. It’d be little banters with small grins their friends would roll their eyes at. They’d play games to see if they were thinking the same word, counting down to say outloud and fall into laughter when it was the same (It always was).
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      How did they not figure out they were in love through that bond? Their friends were dumbfounded for years.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This time, it was only a hint. Rio was pleading for Agatha to know she was sorry. Agatha kept begging Rio to explain why she did it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha..” Rio’s voice weakened, barely above a whisper. “What do you want from me?” She asked. “Apologize for eternity or-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I want the truth,” She answered. “Why can’t you give me that?”
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Rio swallowed the lump in her throat, leaning back in the chair with her eyes breaking from the blue ones she always loved getting lost in. She fondly remembered gazing beside her, mesmerized by the color, how Agatha’s eyes lighted up when she laughed, the way they had a personality of their own.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But now? Agatha’s eyes terrified her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      What if she saw the truth without hearing it? Rio couldn’t chance Agatha knowing leaving her was the worst decision of her life.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She feared the day her old best friend learned she loved her in a way that wasn’t platonic. Rio worried Agatha would find her disgusting for spending each day imagining they were something more.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman shook her head, half covering her mouth with her hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The truth is too awful,” Rio murmured.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s body shifted into nerves unlike ever before. She barely heard what Rio said. It was through closed lips, her head faced away. Something about too awful, but Agatha wasn’t entirely positive. She needed clarity, her voice to be louder.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha needed the fucking answer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What did you say?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha Harkness?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Both jumped at the sound of her name, snapped out of their own world, reality bringing them back to where they were.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t care about the argument they just had. She went from pissed off, hurt, annoyed and frustrated straight into Agatha’s protector.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Unsurprisingly, Agatha forgot everything that had just happened herself. She reversed into a mess of anxiety. Her knee started to bounce, eyes watering as she gripped the arm rest to the point her knuckles were turning white.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looked up, shaking her head as she whispered,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Plea-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nope,” Rio held her hand out, not offering time to argue. “Nicky is far too excited to see the scar this leaves. You’re giving him better access by getting the stitches out”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman begged silently one more time, but ultimately gave in when she knew Rio wasn’t going to let her go. She stood up slowly, hand slipping into Rio’s, unable to rid the thought of how they fit perfectly together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio took the lead as she always did, tugging Agatha in tow. She greeted the nurse, taking on the small talk for her as well. Just when they entered the room, the nurse saying she’d be right back, Rio turned with a tiny lift of her lips. Not enough to fully smile, but not low enough to frown either.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t hate you,” She reminded. “How could I?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shrugged, letting Rio help her sit up on the table, the paper crinkling beneath her. Their hands let go of each other, but Rio still stood by her side.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Maybe it was the chaotic turn of events. How whiplash greeted them left and right. Or, maybe it was the fact Rio was still by her side during all of this.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Every argument, all the silence, the anger and pain, Rio was still there. Her hand still rested on her arm, leaning against her as if they weren’t divided for a year.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Whatever it was, Agatha swallowed her nerves to whisper the words,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know,” She shrugged, watching her feet swing in the air back and forth. “Missedyou”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio took a second to process the two words. Agatha spoke them first. Agatha actually fucking said she
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       missed her
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . The words Rio wished she said earlier back at the dining table after the taunt she gave.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There wasn’t a doubt in her mind that hope was just her imagination. She didn’t find herself scolding in her mind how all the damage was done. Agatha would never forgive or want her back in her life again. But, she said it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Stone cold, horrible with emotions, shitty with words, Agatha Harkness broke before Rio could.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Did I hit my head?
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Rio wondered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah..” Rio whispered. “Me too..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      ____
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The following week went by in a flash. They had shopping sprees, tours of museums, the amusement park, nearly everything under the sun that kept them busy till the big day. Agatha was able to join this time around (Not to her delight, that was for sure). She still dragged in the back beside Lilia, trying to keep her focus everywhere else.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Obviously, Agatha knew it wouldn’t be simple to be near Rio and Hela. No matter what happened in the waiting room, ER, the scene of the crime where Agatha had fallen. None of it changed the way she couldn’t stomach food, how angry she’d find herself when they stood too close. Even worse one time when she caught them kissing. Agatha had left early that night to be alone after it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But, she didn’t know it’d be more difficult to not be speaking to Rio during the week. For a woman who was adamant she’d be acting as if Rio didn’t exist, she hated more than anything they were co-existing in silence.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t uncomfortable, per say. But, it wasn’t joyful either. They shared a few glances, but one looked away the second the other caught them. Sometimes a few words would be shared, but it was small apologies for bumping into each other, little thank yous when the door was held open. Those tiny interactions weren’t enough for Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Luckily, they only had one more night. It was the day of the wedding, the reception would be in the evening, one more night and Agatha would be out by dawn before the rest. Less than twenty four hours, if that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was a countdown of survival, but also a bit of doom knowing her and Rio would go their separate ways again. And this time? There was no guarantee they’d see each other for..who knows how long..
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Birthdays, holidays. They were a small, slim chance, they’d see one another. Agatha knew Nicky would invite Rio to his graduation, but she wasn’t sure if Rio would show up or not. She hoped she did. Not for herself because the thought of never seeing her again felt like hell, but more for her son who adored Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn’t have time to think about that right now. Not when they were about to leave in thirty minutes, not even.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha walked back to the mirror in her bedroom, eyes scanning up and down to make sure her appearance was doable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Agatha got older, she cared less to make a statement. When once she was the loudest woman in the room, desperate to impress all- She wasn’t that person anymore.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wore one of her black dresses, one she prayed Jen did not remember. That woman was always so uptight about not reusing outfits. Agatha was never that person. If she liked a dress (Especially if she spent decent money on it), she was going to wear it more than once.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Ironically, without Agatha even thinking of it, the dress was one of Rio’s ultimate favorites.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The dress flowed down her legs, fabric split on the left side that exposed her leg. The top straps cut off on either side of her shoulders while the front part was a ‘V’ that stopped a bit above her belly button. Wide enough to expose her sternum and a few inches of her breasts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not enough to give them away, Jen would most certainly end her life if she had them on display like that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She ran a hand through her hair, not bothering to tie it up. It was summer, her curls were wild and frizzy. Anyone with hair like hers knew it was pointless in summer to try and manage it. Her heels were downstairs, make-up enough to cover the bags under her eyes and disguise the wound on the tip of her forehead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright..” Agatha muttered, nodding to herself. “Let’s get this over with”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With her phone and pocketbook swiped off the dresser, Agatha walked out into the hallway. She was too busy checking to see if Nicky texted to realize the door beside her opened at the same time. Not until both clicked shut in sync did she slightly jump, turning and-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Fuck.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s mouth went dry, her lips parted as her jaw slightly dropped. She wasn’t surprised by the outfit Rio chose to wear. Also not from how she was stunning in it because to her, Rio was always the most beautiful sight for sore eyes. Even in her boxers, wife beater tank, she was the most precious creature to gaze at.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, this was…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wow..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smirked a bit, cheeks burning as she felt the woman’s eyes scan her up and down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>

     <span>
      spectacular. The same shade of black as Agatha’s, a loose black tie that sat on the piece of her outfit that truly made Agatha’s mind glitch-
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wore a sheer fucking button up. Sheer. Agatha silently scoffed, wondering if Rio was trying to murder her on the spot.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You better hope Jen doesn’t remember that dress” Rio teased.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looked up, blinking a few times as she tried to collect her thoughts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Though,”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smirked, her tongue swiped the inside of her cheek (Agatha wanted to strangle her for that), wiggling her fingers in the air as she gestured up and down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ve always loved this one”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She nodded, forcing a little smile herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Uh..yeah” Agatha cleared her throat, gesturing to her outfit with a rough, trembling voice. “Trying to one up the brides?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio snorted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Flattering, as always” She winked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her confidence faded a moment after. As if her energy was deflated, unable to keep the act going. Agatha let go of the breath she didn’t realize had been held for so long. A little thought in her mind screamed a thank you at the top of it’s lungs Rio wasn’t going to continue being the little flirt she was.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>

     </span>
    </p>

      Agatha always had to repeat those two sentences to herself. A chant, a spell, a mantra that tried to bring her delusional thoughts back into reality.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio cleared her throat, pointing to her own skull at the same spot Agatha’s wound resided.
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>

     <span>
      Agatha wondered until,

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, shit, yeah- Uh,” Agatha stammered, shrugging with a fake laugh. “Fine. Grand. Nicky loves the new developing scar already”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smiled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Course he does,” She said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As always, to Agatha’s dismay, Rio didn’t believe her. The woman narrowed her eyes, lips parting to ask if she was sure that wasn’t a lie.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not that she had to, Rio already knew Agatha was lying through her teeth how she felt

    </p>

     <span>
      “Well, don’t you look divine?”

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela’s voice broke their bubble, walking up with a wicked smile of her own.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio whipped around, Agatha’s eyes ignored Hela to choose her phone instead. She didn’t hesitate to gesture the device in the air, rushing an excuse to get the hell out of dodge before they started flirting right in front of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'll see you guys downstairs,” Agatha said. “Nicky wants to call me before we head out”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She whispered a small goodbye before turning without a passing glance to Rio. The woman behind almost sped off after her, but Hela’s hand on her wrist held her back from doing so.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Let her go,” Hela reminded.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio pulled her lips back, watching Agatha disappear down the staircase, dragging her heart with her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The hand on her wrist was cold, foreign. She remembered how Agatha’s hand felt on her skin, intertwined with her own, how even in their arguments and tension-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her skin never once felt cold. Agatha didn’t make Rio feel like a stranger in her own body.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      At first, she chalked it all up to their history. How long they knew one another, how close they were, but that was all…it mattered, but it didn’t. After a year apart, Agatha
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       should
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      be the one who was frozen to the touch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It should feel wrong to hold her hand, be her voice, by her side, hold her close and the reaction that sparked within her from Agatha simply saying her name alone?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio always knew she loved Agatha, but suddenly, something changed. She didn’t know exactly what everything was. But, what the woman did know?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I can’t do that,” She said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What do you mean?”

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela tightened her fingers around her wrist, but Rio pulled away the second she tried. Her body turned, eyes glossed over with tears as she shook her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I can’t let Agatha go..”

      Unsurprisingly, the wedding ceremony was breathtakingly beautiful. Even with the wind chaotic on the beach, knocking down the altar and flowers that scattered across the sand (Somehow Jen did not lose her mind. Agatha would give her credit for that at some point).
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Everything was perfect and even better when they entered the air conditioned receptional hall. Agatha and Lilia both groaned in relief when the cool air hit their face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For a woman who wasn’t a fan of the cold, Agatha suddenly loved air conditioning more than ever.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Music blasted, laughter and chatter scattered the venue. Agatha found herself sitting at the bar with a wine glass in front of her, hiding away so her friends could not force her on the dance floor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had been succeeding in her game of hide and seek for the first hour until a nudge on her shoulder scared her, the smell of eathly, musk, cologne swallowed the air, and the voice-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Whiskey, on the rocks”

     <em>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha had been avoiding Rio since the ceremony ended. Well, maybe a bit before that. Even with the lack of Hela who suddenly disappeared, she was terrified to be near Rio. Especially after what happened during Jen and Alice’s vows.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was Alice’s best man, standing up beside her as Agatha and Lilia were in the front row. The two women hated being on the spot. Luckily their friends did not guilt or put pressure on them to be in the wedding.
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      She thought she’d be free from feeling on the spot until the burning stare was on her skin as Alice read her vows. Agatha wasn’t able to refrain from looking over, meeting Rio’s gaze, studying the silent smile on her lips. She swore Rio silently screamed at her one significant part of Alice’s vows, but Agatha figured she was being delusional.
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shook it off the best she could, heading straight to the bar once they were all able to pile into the reception. She would avoid Rio, take off early, maybe catch and earlier flight-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Of course, Rio wouldn’t ever let Agatha have it that easy.

     </span>

    </p>
    <p>

      Rio snickered.

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not this one”

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Go away,” Agatha groaned. “You’re disrupting my solitude”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughed, thanking the bartender who slid her drink to her. She brought the glass up to her lips, turning to lean her back on the bar.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So…the nurse..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snickered. Is that what she wanted to talk about?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “When’s the first date?” Rio asked. “Surprised you didn't invite her”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha tilted her head over to find Rio sensing her glare with eyes ready to match her. It was only three seconds before Rio scoffed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You deleted the number, didn’t you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Bingo” Agatha lifted her wine in the air before taking a generous sip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio masked the giddiness the best she could. She drummed her fingertips along the glass in her hand, swiping her tongue on the inside of her cheek as she studied Agatha who was focusing on the wine before her.
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Agatha deleting numbers given to her wasn’t abnormal. If anyone knew how the woman barely cared about dates, women in general, it was Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She knew Agatha didn’t want to bring anyone into Nicky’s life unless there was a certain gut feeling that told her it was safe to do so.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But what was different about this?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha had a fling with Wanda (Which disgusted Rio, but she tried to ignore it) and suddenly a woman across the country was off limits?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shouldn't ask. It wasn't in her best interest to put herself through that. Besides, shouldn't they be back to fighting? The medical situation was over. They were in circles of the same argument, spiraling into different confessions and emotions.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      One moment Agatha hated her, the next she missed her.

      “Why?” Rio asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snorted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t-” She shook her head. “No, long distance-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No one says it had to be that. A one and done, fling while you’re out here. Wouldn't be your first..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The words were killing her with every breath she took between them. But, it was a cover up. Desperation to fix the mistake during Alice’s vows. She wondered if Agatha didn't notice, but certainly wasn’t going to take any chances.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Listen..” Agatha muttered. “I don’t give a fuck how you’re in a
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>

     <span>
      right now. I don’t need to be”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Besides,” Agatha flipped her hair back, sitting up straighter while looking straight ahead. “Much rather spend my days alone”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She added, looking over with a taunting smile. One that was a warning, gave Rio an unsettling feeling for the words about to come.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Someone taught me all people do is leave. Without a goodbye. Isn’t that right,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       dear?
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       There it is.
      </span>

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stared for a second before puffing out a bit of air from her nose, shaking her head as she took a sip of the whiskey.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once again, Rio cursed where they were. Jen would actually slaughter them into pieces if they fought on their wedding day.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She pushed off the bar, leaning closer to mutter under her breath for Agatha’s ears only.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know,” Rio said. “It isn’t just me not giving up the truth here and we both know it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha whipped her head over.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So you admit you aren’t telling me something?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What exactly do you think I’m not owning up to?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha pulled her lips back, debating if honesty would be the right choice or she’d take her typical route of distraction and denial. Though like the times before, it was a simple
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fuck it.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Not like I’ll see you again after this..
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why you really left..” She whispered. “All I ever wanted for you was that job of yours. It’s everything you dreamt-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You weren't hiding that anger of yours about it well, Agatha”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha paused, shaking her head with a tiny laugh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And you took that as jealousy?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugged, Agatha scoffed. No words were exchanged. Rio watched as Agatha finished off her wine, pulling out cash for the tip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For being the only person I allowed to see right fucking through me all these years, you’re really shit at it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “At what?” Rio questioned, her voice higher pitched as she panicked where Agatha was off to.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smacked the cash down, snapping the pocketbook shut with a sad smile towards Rio. She stared for a few seconds, letting her eyes roam along every inch of her figure. Then they returned, the sad smile grew wider as she softly said,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Goodbye, Rio”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She pushed off the barstool, disappearing through the sea of people.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Typically Rio would roll her eyes, knowing Agatha’s theatrics and how she’d see her in the next hour.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, this felt different…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Something about her voice. It was far too calm, lifeless even. And the words leading up to the departure…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Fuck.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This wasn't right. Something was off, Rio felt it in her bones. As she drank heavier from her whiskey, sips turning into gulps, the other side of the token dropped on her...
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      What wasn’t Agatha telling her?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And if it wasn’t jealousy (Which Rio never truly thought. It was easier to tell herself that to ignore how leaving Agatha killed her)..
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Why did you react like that?

     </span>

      ___
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After a long shower, the last quarter of champagne Lilia had stored in the kitchen, Agatha buried herself in bedsheets. She had turned off her phone after making sure Nicholas was alright. He went next door to Wanda’s for the night.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Apparently he and Billy were being bribed to watch the ceremony. Wanda had requested a video after agreeing to hang back with the boys. Agatha promised to make it up to them both for taking one for the team. They all were well aware of how hysterical Wanda’s emotional theatrics could be.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was zoned out to some black and white movie. Some old time footage, cowboy and what appeared to be some princess. Truly, Agatha wasn’t paying attention to it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her anxiety coursed through her veins, desperate for time to pass so she could be on a plane back to safety. She was about to leave earlier just to escape the house, but tiredness took over her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Besides, the rest were at the reception probably drunk off their ass, having the time of their lives.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      …Or, so she thought.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t hear the front door bust open, footsteps charging up the stairs. She only was alerted when the bedroom door bounced against the wall and slammed shut.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What the fuck?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She exclaimed, sitting up quickly from her cocoon of blankets. Her head betrayed her, causing dizziness that temporarily spiraled her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It took a moment for her to register how Rio didn’t bother with the remote. Instead opted to rip the cord from the wall, turning the TV screen to pitch black.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What the hell is your issue?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nearly screamed, watching as Rio was pacing around the room like a mad woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio wha-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You! You are my problem!” She yelled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      One hand was in her hair, the other waving her pointer finger at Agatha as she turned left and right.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, fucks sake..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha muttered, rolling her eyes back before bringing her knees up to her chest. She ran hands over her face, through the tangled hair, landing on the nape of her neck.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What is it now, Rio?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shook her head, not giving a glance to the woman she was fed up with. Her pacing became more aggressive by the second. Agatha lightly scoffed over the sight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re making me sick here with the pacing”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You were angry with me when I told you about the job,”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my god, here we go again”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No!” Rio finally looked over, eyes sharp with rage. “We’re doing this. While this house is fucking empty and I can scream my lungs out at you like you deserve”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha laughed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I deserve?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes! You smashed beer bottles, threw a tantrum, stormed around and barely acknowledged me. You were-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha pulled the covers off of her legs, swinging them off to rest on the floor. She didn’t care to think about her outfit. Rio’s old green flannel boxers, the baggy Bohner Camp t-shirt that had faded over time. Luckily Rio was too busy to even take note of it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Bullshit! I was nothing but supportive” She stood, arms crossed as she rounded the bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s laugh trembled, her pacing coming to a slow stop. But she didn’t back away. She slowly started to step forward, closing the distance between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That was not supportive. Not at all”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha knew this argument was going in circles. She was tired, drained, ready to end it once and for all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, you ran with this fucking theory of yours? Huh?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not a theory,” Rio argued.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right, a make believe story then?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How was it make believe when I was there?!” Rio yelled, arms extended as she lowered her body slightly. “You clearly faked being excited for me”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, what-fuckin-ever” She laughed, shaking her head. “Real mature, by the way. How instead you skipped town, forgot me like I never exist-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turned to face the wall, hands moved to her hips. She peaked over, lips curled into disgust.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m starting to think that shit from the hospital, waiting room, it was all bullshit”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Bullshit?! Oh, totally. Yep. That’s why I stayed. That’s why I fucking chased you down, held you, didn’t blink to have your blood covering me, refused to leave your side and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh wow! So you

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jesus!” Rio hissed. “Do you hear yourself? Have you even heard me?! I’ve apologized! I fucked up! I-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha held her breath, thinking about the letters unopened in her nightstand. They were held together with a rubber band, neatly organized from oldest to newest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She only opened one, but never unfolded the paper inside. There was no strength within her to do so. The pain, shock, it was all too fresh. A wound deeper than the one the concrete gave her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why would I? Can you blame me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t blame her, truly. She’d probably be the same if Agatha left like she did. But, the attempt was still made. Rio still tried. It wasn’t fair Agatha kept yelling at her for no word on what happened.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, stop fucking saying I didn’t explain shit” She shrugged. “I tried, Agatha and you wouldn’t let me”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat. She moved her arms back to cross over her lower chest, hiding herself into safety.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You left without a goodbye, Rio. You said it to everyone else, lied to them how I couldn’t make it to the goodbye, and you really think I’d give you the time of day to explain yourself?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No..” Rio whispered. “But..no, you need to stop saying I left with no explanation when I tried”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio, you shouldn’t have left like that in the first place”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Their voices were too strained to yell anymore. Both weak, tired, exhausted of the drama between them. They missed each other deeply, but felt so betrayed and hurt at the same time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       What if we can’t fix this?
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Rio wondered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      No. She wasn’t going to leave them with no effort to fix the damage that kept them apart. Even if they still walked away without a second thought, Rio felt it’d be worse to leave with the regret she never tried.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine..you’re right” Rio said, bringing Agatha’s strong glare into shock.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. How many times- I’ll fucking preach it, Agatha. Let’s get a chalkboard, I’ll write it down a hundred times over or-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Whatever it takes! I will fucking do it so you understand how sorry I am if that’s what you want from me! Tell me, just tell-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tell me the truth!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s plea came to a halt. She stared wide, breath hitched, heart palpitating at the rapid speed, faster than before.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s what I want” She answered Rio’s demand. “You said we are both hiding something here” Agatha said. “So,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       tell me
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . What is it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Close to a minute went by without Rio giving an answer. Just a blank stare, an empty void. Agatha wanted to toss her out of the room, tell her to get out of her life again. But, something in her was stronger than her desire to escape.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If Rio would offer the truth, Agatha would ask for another answer she craved.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why did you react that way about Wanda?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha asked, shrugging her shoulders as if she didn’t dramatically take them in another direction.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s not like I didn’t fuck you as well. Not that you care to remember it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What does this have to do with anything?” Rio sharply whispered, voice trembling on the edge of terror.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, if you won’t give me the truth on why you left, might as well get the truth out of something here” Agatha laughed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once again, dead silence sat in the air between them. Rio’s blank stare was aimed at the floor. She clenched her jaw, trying to steady her breath, wondering if she’d surpass a panic attack straight into her time of death. Luckily for her…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wasn’t going to let her figure that answer out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Get out,” Agatha muttered. “I’m done here,” She added. “I have to get packing for my flight. I was able to get one for six, so..go”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ag-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio, go” Agatha’s voice was stronger, turning her back on her to pick up the suitcase. It was already packed, but Rio only needed to fall for the illusion. “I’m too tired, my head sucks, and I just don’t have it in me to fight in circles like this if you don’t care to-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine!” Rio screamed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was now or never, a lifeline teetering on the verge of death. Rio felt she was facing the grim reaper in the flesh. Her biggest fear, worst nightmare, but..could Agatha really hate her more than she already did?
     </span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
      Rio watched Agatha’s movements freeze as if the world stopped.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was in the middle of rolling her suitcase close to her. It stopped a step away, the room felt vacant and louder with fear at once. Rio knew she only had a few seconds before Agatha told her to leave once again. She had to get everything out before that happened.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ve been in love with you for years”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She said, voice weaker than ever before. Her eyes stung with tears, failing to suffocate the tiny sobs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If I tried to say goodbye, I never would have left. I’m horrible because it was so much easier to blame you over owning up to this”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha swore she heard every word wrong. It must’ve been like the stare they shared during Alice’s vow. A delusional thought, a dream she tried to let herself get lost in to mask the pain. But as Rio continued…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, there. Happy?” Rio asked before she started to make her way to the door. “I’ll go, but that’s the truth. Just like you wanted”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looked over her shoulder when she heard Rio’s feet disappear across the floor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Suddenly, there was no more control.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Something in her mind had shifted gears, hacked her brain waves to take control. She didn't feel in charge of her body any longer as her feet took leaps across the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just as Rio was turning the knob, Agatha’s hand lunged out to keep the door shut. Her arm brushed against Rio’s shoulder, front nearly pressed against the woman’s back. That was enough to make Agatha feel electricity sparking within her, closer and closer to an explosion.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio turned, holding her breath when she realized just how close they truly were. The way she felt Agatha’s breath on her lips, her body leaning forward, hand still pressed against the door right beside her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She shivered, whispering under her breath,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, what-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha leaned in, not offering a second before their lips met and the explosion she felt on the verge of ignited.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The other woman was stunned, confused, caught in a trance of disbelief. She felt Agatha’s lips move against her’s, silently begging for Rio to kiss her back. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to, but Rio still felt doubt this was real.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was about to wake up from this dream, slight nightmare for how she’d realize it wasn’t real. Rio was sure of it. Agatha kissing her wasn't a rare dream. It was a common occurrence since she fell in love.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio needed confirmation, just a smidge.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ag-”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha muttered the order against her lips, her free hand moved to grip her hip. Rio took an inhale through her nose, swallowing her fear before thinking a soft-
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If this was a dream, she might as well have some enjoyment out of it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio pushed herself into the kiss, offering more energy than Agatha initially gave her. She nearly melted at the little moan that crawled up Agatha’s throat and vibrated against her lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t waste a second to slither her other hand down. She gripped her hips, fingers laced through the belt loops to tug Rio off the wall.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Silently unspoken, Rio followed her lead, letting herself be guided back into the room. She shot her hands up to rub across Agatha’s face, pushed back to intertwine through her hair and tug tightly at the roots.
     </span>
    </p>

      , (Rio would daydream about that sound for years to come), slipping her tongue between Rio’s lips with no warning.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When the back of Agatha’s legs hit the bed, she parted their lips enough to grunt a low,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio paused, a tiny scoff before she pushed Agatha down on the bed, straddling her waist as if they had done this before. Her hand gently cradled the back of her head before she completely fell, making sure she didn’t harm her at all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hated how it made her heart swell larger. In the heat of the moment, the middle of a fight, Rio was still tender and careful to not hurt her. God, she was doomed to love this fucking woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      Rio’s hands moved to press down on either side of her abdomen, tugging the hem of her shirt up slowly.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I fucking remember that night, you asshole”

     <span>

    </p>

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio kept their eyes locked, annoyed yet excited with every word Agatha said. She surpassed the hem of the shirt, hands slipping underneath. Agatha gasped when the cold skin touched her own, sending chills down her spine.

     <span>
      “I blamed it on the alcohol,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       idiot
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . That's not paradin-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Bullshi-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio silently thanked Agatha for not wearing her bra. It was much easier to turn the words into a hiss, her fingers met the woman’s nipples to roll her thumbs over before pinching the sensitive nubs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She lowered herself to whisper against Agatha’s lips, tugging the nipples up towards as she spoke,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ignored me for days, maybe weeks after it? Yeah. You did,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       bitch
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her dominance, upper hand, it didn't last long. She should have known staying in charge wouldn’t be so simple. Agatha was powerful, a woman who needed control.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Rio could say a word, take another breath, collect every thought and gather her next move-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fuck!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio gasped as the room spun around. Her back collided with the mattress, Agatha's hair smacking her in the face before the strands were pushed back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instinctively, Rio went to push herself up, but realized in the chaos, Agatha had her hands pinned above her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She blinked a few times, lips parted but Rio had fallen speechless as the beauty above glared down on her. The way Agatha's nails dug into her wrists, how her legs squeezed her hips, and-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm the bitch?!” Agatha asked, shaking her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her glare faltered, gaze drifted to her lips. Agatha muttered under breath some incoherent complaint. Rio only made out something about being annoyed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wasn’t able to think about it long, but no complaints were on her end.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha had crushed their lips back together, teeth smacked and cut into their lips. The subtle metallic blood mixed with saliva roamed over their taste buds. Neither phased, too eager to taste and feel every inch of one another.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The bitch is you, fuckin’ say goodbye to everyone,” Agatha muttered against her lips, her hand moved to push down her sternum. “Cut me off, act like I don't exis-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, no!” Rio exclaimed, ripping her lips off as she tried to push up, but Agatha’s strength held her down. “I texted, I called, you sent me to voice-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Again, why the hell would I want to talk when you left without a care?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s nostrils flared, their heavy pants were in sync, eyes mixed the same amount of lust, frustration, and fuck ton of confusion because what the
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       hell
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      were they doing?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's lips slowly curled, she arched her back before rolling down to let her hips raise. She grinned like a mad woman as Agatha pressed herself back down, scoffing with a low,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, I don’t know,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      You could have asked why I did that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha's glare sharpened, visibly struggling to contain a moan of her own. She was quick to shake her head before letting go of Rio's wrists. Just as fingertips grazed the buttons of her shirt, Rio's hands flew down, but Agatha's smacked with nails scraping her skin to push them back up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I swear to fucking god, do not touch me-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh!” Rio laughed. “That’s rich from the woman nearly ripping my buttons off. You know, this top was expensive. So for you to-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha slipped her fingertips beneath each side, smirking wide as she ripped the shirt apart. One button smacked Agatha's chin, a few hit the headboard, others landed on the bed while some disappeared to the floor. Ultimately, the shirt was beyond repair (Unless Rio didn't mind going button-less), not that Agatha gave a shit. She had gotten what she wanted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The exposed skin shining below, how Rio swiped her tongue on the inside of her cheek, cheeks burning red as her nostrils flared in a mix of annoyance and lust.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fuck you” Rio muttered, her jaw clenched while struggling to keep a threatening glare.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha's smirk only widened, eyes darkened like the devil herself. She scraped her nails along Rio's skin. Up her abdomen, over her sternum, and back down again. Only twice before she shot her palm up like a catapult as her fingers wrapped around the woman's throat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The whimper the sudden grasp pulled from Rio made Agatha's body shiver, struggling to keep herself together. Though she found enough strength to collect herself. Her hand tightened, applying a subtle amount of pressure with a low, raspy, chuckle against Rio's ear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       honey,
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      use that fucking silence you've given me the last year and I might just do that”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s pupils dilated when a burning electric shock struck through her, directly hitting the target between her legs. Right after the words were said, sending her into a deep hypnotic state.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s teeth that gently bit down on her earlobe, tugging back before letting go-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       This is real.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      No dream existed, nothing about this was another dimension or universe. Rio was present in reality as Agatha’s lips trailed down her jawline, skipping the other side to move down her neck.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ag-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The name that began to roll off her tongue was cut short. Agatha had taken hold of the tie, moving the knot up to press against her throat. She gasped, the pressure making her back arch as the raspy chuckle against her skin sent a wildfire of chills across her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio, I only want to hear two things out of you right now”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sat up, her grip on the tie strong as the other pressed down on her wrists. Rio gulped when the blue eyes were predatory, ready to pounce and possibly kill her on the spot right then and there.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “One,” Agatha whispered, the tie being loosened just an inch. “Tell me..you wan-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I want you” Rio rushed, her panting emphasizing the words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Will you remember this time?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio frantically nodded. She still had her power within her, not ready to completely cave into Agatha quite yet. Her lips lifted into a devious smirk, whispering in a low tone,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Will you ignore me again?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha paused, a low laugh made Rio’s nerves turn inside out. She clicked her tongue, forcing the tie back to tighten around her throat more than before. She leaned down for their lips to ghost against one another, eyes never unlocking from Rio’s.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s not the answer I’m looking for..
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       mi amor”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio audibly moaned at a volume she felt embarrassed over. But,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fuck..
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      did Agatha know what her speaking Spanish did to her all these years? God, she didn’t want to know.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t like repeating myself, Rio,” She said. “It’s in your best interest to behave and play along. Unless, you like consequences..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha then smirked, a dark chuckle filled the space where Rio’s reply should have been.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Of course,” She said. “I shouldn’t be surprised”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio pulled her lips back, squirming under her, desperate to take back control. She was dangerously close to falling under the woman’s power completely. Not that she didn’t want to, but-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “A pathetic little
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       brat
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      like yourself can’t help it. Isn’t that right?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her voice was silk, heavy, and tasted delicious on Rio’s tongue- Which was only a reminder, she suddenly felt the strongest craving possible for Agatha to be on her tongue once more. More than just her blood and saliva. She needed all of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Look at you..” Agatha cooed. “Fighting against what you truly desire..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She loosened the tie just a bit, fingertips trailing down to the exposed skin the buttoned shirt used to hide.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I bet you wished all that alcohol made you forget that night, huh? Hm, well I didn’t..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was in her own world, her own power, as if she was in the classroom- Dominating the atmosphere and Rio was her only student.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know..” She tilted her head, looking up with a tiny grin. “I loved you that night. For the first time, anyway. Moment of realization, I’d say”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s eyes went wide, her heart melted and kicked up in speed simultaneously. She broke her silence to whisper a small,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You love me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smirked, quiet with the words locked in her mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She pushed both sides of the shirt off her chest. A soft gasp was heard, letting go of her wrists to move both hands over each breast. She squeezed delicately, then with more pressure. Her thumbs slowly rolled over her nipples in sync, smirking at the way Rio gasped and trembled beneath her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What do you think?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha muttered before dipping down, wrapping her lips around the sensitive bud that sat on her left.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The motion was quick, no graceful slowness. Rio jumped when her teeth gently bit down, lips then sucked and pulled off with a pop. She did the same to the other side, a bit more aggression as if the first kicked her into gear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio wasn’t sure how much time had passed before Agatha pulled her up to get rid of the shirt. She worked to rid her pants, maneuvering off of her so they could disappear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groaned at the sight of the green lace boxer briefs shining on her skin. She trailed her fingertips over the waistband, about to trail down when Rio’s hand gripped her shirt.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I said, don’t touch-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Take my fucking boxers off-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What do you think I’m trying to do?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her hand moved off Agatha’s shirt to the side of her shorts. The baggy boxers that belonged to Rio. When the other woman caught on, her cheeks shaded a burning red, followed by a tiny glare at Rio who was grinning up at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shook her head, ripping the woman’s hand off to pin both above her head again. She undid the tie around her neck, swiftly locking her wrists together in the fabrics hold.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I never got to tell you the second thing,”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha said, tugging the restraint to make sure it was tight. She then moved back, fingertips leaving a tickling sensation over her skin as they scraped their way down. Her face still hovered above Rio’s, eyes roaming over her lips and then to the eyes silently begging for her touch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      “The only sounds I want to hear from you..”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha dipped down, licking a tiny streak over the woman’s lips. A tease of what Rio craved. She then chuckled, leaving a chaste kiss before sitting back up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re a smart girl..what do you think I want to hear?”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shivered, whimpering softly as she whispered,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      “My moans?”

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha made a little,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Ding ding ding..”

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Noise before she shot down the bed like a rocket. Her teeth left a few bite marks over her stomach, determined to leave marks for Rio to remember her by. Agatha wasn’t sure if she’d stay till the morning. Part of her wanted to while the other was far too terrified, but..
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Clearly, she wasn’t going to think about that right now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha let her finger roam over the cloth from the hem, down to the spot she was most excited for. And just as she hoped?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, Rio..” She laughed, looking up with a smile. “Sweetheart..you’re soaked”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nodded, whimpering as she pressed her hips lower, trying to find more friction however she could. But, Agatha pulled away with a glare.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m in control here, understand?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ag-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman rolled her eyes in annoyance. She lifted her hand, leaning up as the heel of palm dug right against Rio’s clit. The fabric created a barrier, but not a strong enough one that’d make the feeling less intense.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s words cut off into a cry. She turned her head with her eyes shut, squeezing her hands locked in the restraint.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Again, hate repeating myself here, Ri-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes! Yes,” She repeated in a breathless voice. “Just,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       shit”
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      She gasped, shaking her head. “Fuck me, Agatha. Please. I need you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smirked, not expecting the reaction, but didn’t argue against it either. She hummed with a little laugh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah, honey. That much is clear” She rasped.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her fingers worked to strip the last article of clothing off of her. She balled the underwear up, gently placing it next to Rio on the bed. Though her eyes never moved off the spot of Rio she thought would never be visible to her again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s throat went dry as she pushed Rio’s legs open more, exposing the drenched mess between both folds. The familiar scent Agatha was never able to forget greeted her like a warm welcome home. Hint of musk, sweetness, and overall..
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Rio.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She rubbed her hands up the woman’s thighs, studying close to how the dark black patch of hair was slick against her skin. Arousal had drenched her to the core, nearly covering every inch. Agatha was sure it’d reach every inch of her head to toe if possible.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What’s wrong?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snapped her head up, eyebrows furrowed in confusion as to what Rio was asking.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wha-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You- You’re…you’re staring like something isn’t…I-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As aggressive as Agatha had been, too wrapped up in the fury of their argument, shock of what it had turned into. She still cared for Rio in ways impossible with others. Agatha snapped into a mode so soft, for Rio’s eyes only.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Words weren’t Agatha’s forte, they never came easy to her. She shook her head, leaning to leave a trail of kisses up her inner thigh, mirroring the same on the other. If they hadn’t changed, things were still the same and they clicked as well as they did before-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio would feel nothing was wrong. She’d trust Agatha’s silent words and know simply that..nothing was wrong.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t want to start slow. She was too fearful this would end and she’d lose her chance forever. Plus, they weren’t sure when Lilia would be back from the reception. On Agatha’s end, she still expected Hela to show up at any given moment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She licked her lips before giving one last smile up at Rio. A devious one, a warning for what was about to hit her. Not a second after did Agatha dive in head first. As if she was jumping into a lake of bliss, ocean of glory.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s tongue slipped between her folds, ran over her clit, lips wrapped around the bud as she started to suck the life out of it. Agatha felt a desire to drain every drop out of Rio, to fill her entire body and soul with her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The taste of her was one thing, the feeling of Rii’s thighs pressed against her head was another. But the sound above? Rio’s moans that were a string of pure heaven bounced off the walls, held enough power to shake the ocean floor. Agatha wanted to crash into her own orgasm over the sound alone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was her drug and Agatha was determined to overdose till her last breath.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She worked her fingers beneath her chin, the two pressing against her entrance in a teasing manner. Rio’s hips started to thrust up with a whisper beneath the moans, a mantra of pleas. Agatha couldn’t hold back, thrusting them in and nearly crying herself at the reaction it stripped out of Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A chant of,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Agatha”
      </span>

    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A few others were lost in the mix of them all, but Agatha was too overwhelmed herself to coherently pick apart each one. Even more so when she felt the fingers combing through her hair.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The tie still held her wrists together, but Rio couldn’t refrain herself any longer. She didn’t care what Agatha did, but luckily for her-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha only moaned and shocked a vibration against her clit that made Rio whine harder.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This was nothing like before. Their one off night alone would never compare (Even if that’s when Agatha knew she fell in love with her). From the way they spent a year apart, the fight between them, how even in the mix up of pain and resentment-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio still cared, Agatha still needed her, and something about them tangled together in such an intimate way..
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio came around her fingers a few thrusts in, but both couldn’t tell you how long ago that was.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t stop. She couldn’t.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The crazed addict between her legs kept running until her fingers cramped hard to the point they couldn’t possibly move. She flicked her tongue till it was raw, lips tight and puffed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman pulled away, slipping her fingers out that made Rio wince as she felt the complete loss. She took a moment to admire the mess created by her alone. Her hand roamed up to rest on Rio’s stomach, feeling her breaths heavy as she tried to catch and steady herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha couldn’t help herself from dipping down, licking a wide strip to collect every drop she possibly missed. The woman chuckled when Rio’s hips jerked against her face, a strong whimper as she whined a high pitch,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ag..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman smirked, looking up with a soft,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not my fault you taste good, dear”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio huffed, but the warmth on her cheeks and lazy smile betrayed her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She raised her hands up, wrists gestured for Agatha to untie. The woman did without a word, tossing the tie on the floor behind her. She didn’t waste a second to turn, kissing up every inch of her skin till her nose bumped against Rio’s chin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t get to tease much longer. Rio used her now free hands to hold her face, bringing her up for their lips to melt together. This time softer than before. No aggression, power. Both too lazy, drunk on what had just happened.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Though as the kiss lingered, a few pecks dwelled down to none, Rio's forehead rested on Agatha's. Their breathing started to become even as they took in what just happened.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes closed, but Rio’s stayed open to make sure she was real. Even if reality had greeted her, smacked her in the face, fucked her senseless-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman didn’t open her eyes, but hummed softly to let her know she was listening.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Rio swallowed the lump in her throat, hands moved to intertwine with the mess of tangles all over again. Agatha had moved to rest her head on Rio’s chest, silencing her longer than she intended to.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio?” Agatha slurred the question, wondering why she said her name.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The younger woman felt tears sting her eyes, holding her close as fear struck her that none of this was real.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I really missed you..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s body stiffened, but relaxed not a millisecond after. She didn't offer a verbal reply. Instead, held Rio tighter, a soft kiss on her collarbone a second after.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t need words though. Holding Agatha, still feeling her touch and the taste on her tongue. A blend of herself, Agatha’s blood and tongue..if it were a wine, she’d order it by the cases. She let her eyelids droop, the heaviness of them taking over.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn't know what would happen, where this would go, but all she knew right then..

      The following morning was hectic to say the least. What should’ve been a simple farewell turned into something more. Lilia’s flight was set to leave at eleven, Rio (And formally Hela) were going to take the rental car back before heading home. She knew Agatha had gotten a flight at six, but after the night before? Rio was sure she wouldn’t leave.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That was until Rio woke up to an empty bed, the room vacant of Agatha’s belongings. Lilia didn’t need explanation for the way Rio was running around the entire house, searching high and low for all her stuff. She read it all over her face, the mess of hair and clothes-
     </span>

      Lilia debated telling her, but it was much more amusing to let her go on the way she was. She eventually put her coffee down, reaching out to grasp Rio’s wrist. The woman almost fell backwards, asking a strong,

      Lilia knew the giving a piece of her mind line was absolute bullshit. Rio would get off the plane, her plan would shift into getting Agatha back over telling her off. But, she let the woman have her rage. Once again, finding it far too entertaining.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had thanked Lilia on her way out the door, running to jump on a plane she wasn't packed for. Her mind was scattered all over the place. She ended up just putting a few clothes, wallet, phone and charger in her backpack. Luckily for her, Lilia took note of the extra belongings that needed to be taken with her.
     </span>

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The Uber took too long to show up. Rio ended up jumping in a taxi, completely forgetting to cancel. She lost money, but the numbers didn't matter. The only thing in her mind was seeing Agatha in the flesh. She wasn't going to text or call. There was a chance of being ignored that way.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not only did the chance of being ignored scare her, but more so never seeing the woman again was worse. Especially after the night before.

     <span>
     </span>

      Rio had confessed her biggest secret to the one who was never supposed to know. Agatha fucked her so thoroughly and completely, Rio felt as if she was still inside her (She knew she was a weirdo for that one, but didn’t care).
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She almost forgot her bag in the taxi when the familiar house was in her sight. It took everything to not jump out of the vehicle before it came to a stop.
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smacked cash into the driver's hand. Most likely way more than she actually owed, but karma would come back in a good way for a decent size tip. At least, that's what she told herself.
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It took a bit for her to work up the courage to knock on the wooden door. When she once used to unlock it herself, walk in like she owned the place. She now felt out of sorts, home but a stranger to it.

      Luckily, Agatha took the small blue package from her. She understood the silent gesture meant to take it from her, but at the same time? If only Rio could find joy in any of this. Agatha's face twisted into confusion was hysterical to say the least.

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      She was tired of running in circles like they had been. Two dogs chasing their own tails. The same argument, same conversation, same dance had taken a new step. They confessed being in love, Agatha fucked her till she couldn't breathe.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      Rio couldn't let the new step stay in the circle. It was a foot out of the ring, an exit to escape the infinite trap.

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The words kept betraying her, a threat to send them back, but Rio shook her head. She adjusted the bag on her shoulder, stepping forward while holding herself a bit higher. Her eyes unlocked from Agatha's, slowly trailing down to the lips glistening in the porch light as if they called for her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      She lifted her hands, but then shot them back down. Her body tilted forward and swayed back. Rio shook her head, silently cursing herself out because she was being such a confused coward.

    <p>
     <span>
      The other woman took in a deep breath, spinning the package of gum back and forth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don't know..” Agatha whispered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio scoffed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, that…after we talked-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That was a talk?” Agatha asked with amusement in her words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha..” Rio muttered. “Don't”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman put her hands up in surrender, gesturing Rio had the floor to talk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio took a deep breath, nodding to herself. Sure, Agatha should be filling the space with explanations as to why she left. But, if either of them needed to get emotions off their chest? Rio took the award for it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I want you,” She said. “No other way to put it” Rio added.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looked back to Agatha. Her smirk gone, faded away as if it never existed. Rio read the hesitation and worry all over her, lighting up like a Christmas Tree.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ve wanted you for..fuck, I don’t know how long now” Rio laughed. “I don’t want last night to just be..
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       that.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      If you’ll have me, I can- I will try my fucking hardest to be everything for you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She waited and waited, but Agatha never moved. Her lips didn't part, no sign of taking a step forward or back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If Rio didn't see right through her, she'd be dead and gone by now. As others would think of Agatha as stone cold, lifeless, clearly uninterested in what Rio was selling.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio knew it was none of that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looked terrified herself. Rio started to wonder if panic took over every logical thinking just like it had with her a year ago.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But even with the subtle knowing, the silent understanding, Rio needed an answer. She needed words of the sorts that'd tell her what was going on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What do you-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Kiss me” Agatha whispered. “Please..just-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t hesitate for more than a few seconds. She lunged out, cupping both sides of Agatha’s face as their lips greeted each other once again.  Sure, she needed some words to be said. But if she learned anything with Agatha, the woman’s actions spoke ten times louder than words ever could.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She remembered each time Rio was sick, Agatha would shower her with stuffed animals and candy. The woman took care of her, fed her, and brought her anything she desired. One time when she came down with the flu for three weeks, Agatha gave her a bell to ring to call for her. She didn’t know how to verbalize for Rio to get better, but she could show her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The times Rio was upset, frustrated, down in the dumps- Agatha wasn’t exactly great at moral pep talks or emotional heart to hearts. But she was a drinker, and knew how to find some stupid murder mystery game for them to play. Other times she’d drag Rio out of bed for ice cream.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was even one time she took her on a drive just to do donuts in snow covered parking lots. They nearly tipped the car over once and swore it off for a few years.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Safe to say, Agatha had her own language Rio was fluent in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha held her wrists tight, leaned her body forward before letting Rio push her till her back collided with the wall. When Rio pulled away for a second to gasp for air, the unexpected words hit her like a freight train,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I love you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman paused just with their noses brushed together, lips about to meet again. Agatha’s grip tightened, nails digging into her skin. Rio was about to calm her nerves, let her know everything was alright and she just needed to process the three words-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Does this mean I can go camping with Billy this weekend?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio almost winced from how Agatha’s grip had impossibly tightened even more. Her eyes were bloodshot open, the unspoken words screaming how she forgot Nicholas was still home. It took everything in Rio to not laugh over the panic on her face. This wasn’t like she was a stranger his mother was making out with. She knew how Agatha felt, but luckily she was just Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She cleared her throat, pulling away with a cheeky grin. One that acted as if Agatha wasn’t burying her face away, still gripping onto Rio’s wrist.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Long time no see, kid” Rio said, gesturing to his head. “How's the weather up there?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The boy rolled his eyes, seemingly unphased with the joke and situation entirely.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ha. Ha. Height jokes. So original, so funny, so-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jesus, you sound more and more like your mother” Rio shook her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Guess that's what happens when you leave me on my own with her,” Nicky shrugged. “But yeah, Mom? Camping? Can-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don't you have somewhere to be?” Agatha asked, snapping her head over with a subtle glare.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, if you let me go camping for the weekend- As a matter of fact, I do. But!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      He grinned, nearly hopping in the air with a clap of his hands. They both shared a glance, knowing the boy was scheming and about to annoy them to no end. His little shit look hadn’t changed with age.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'd love to hang out with you two! If I don't go camping, my weekend is free to be your guy's
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       best buddy
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . We can watch movies, video games, dinner-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my god. Yes! Fine!” Agatha groaned, rubbing her hand over her face before waving it his way. “Go! Pack!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The boy leaned back with his fists up to his chest before running to the stairs. But not a second after did he creep his head around the corner with another evil grin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, Rio, can you do..whatever gross shit this is again in a few months? There's a concert I want to go to and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nicholas, don’t make me count to five like you’re a child again” Agatha warned.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “See! I’m not a child, means I’m old enough for camping and concerts and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nicky, buddy, missed you too. But you may want to run before I have to dig your grave” Rio said, but quickly mouthed how she would help him out in the future.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky gave a small salute before racing to the stairs. This time they listened to his feet patter up and run down the hall. Rio smiled, gazing back at Agatha with a small,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He’s so fuckin’ tall”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed, tossing her head back against the wall.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He so just saw me fuckin’ make out with someone”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t help the warm laugh that exploded from her chest. She moved her hands to run up her arms, soothing her softly with a low,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not like I’m some random woman you brought home..or his best friend’s mother-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay,” Agatha laughed. “If we..whatever
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       this
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      is,” She pointed. “Can’t kill, Wanda”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman dramatically sighed, feigning a small debate in her mind before giving in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine. I won’t, but..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her smile faded, lips pulled back while her eyes softened into a vulnerable state. Territory Agatha knew they were bound to step into.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You won’t leave me like that again if we do this?” Rio asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snickered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can ask you the same thing, you know?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio slowly smiled, lifting a hand to push the few loose strands of hair out of Agatha’s face. She then brushed her thumb down her cheek, over her lips and along her jaw. Agatha shivered in her touch, letting out a sigh mixed with relief and lust.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I was scared you’d regret it..” Agatha whispered. “I mean, Hela. You look so happy with her and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She belted out a laugh, but Agatha shook her head, not understanding why Rio found humor in it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t! I already feel horrible enough I fucked you behind her back and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, honey” Rio laughed, placing both hands on her upper arms to squeeze softly, bringing her words to silence. “Why do you think she suddenly wasn’t at the wedding?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The other woman’s eyebrows furrowed, shaking her head as she muttered,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, no. I swear, she was on her way or whatever" Agatha said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shook her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "No, love. We ended things right before we left the house for the wedding"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha's eyes gawked, her lips parted, stuttering out little questions and sounds of disbelief. Rio simply smiled, too busy lost in a daze over how Agatha was on the verge of being completely her's in a way she dreamt of forever.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "And.." Rio whispered. "There's no regretting that. The only regret I'll always hold is missing out on a year with you"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The other woman felt an ache in her chest, a burning sensation of tears forming in her eyes. She shook her head repeatedly, holding the woman's hips with a soft,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "We're...it's gone. That's over. We can't keep dwelling on it" Agatha whispered. "Not when we have..this"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smiled, feeling tears of her own as she wiped a few of Agatha's off her face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "What the fuck even is this?" Agatha asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Both froze before falling into a small fit of laughter, grinning like fools and they still felt none of it was real.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha couldn't comprehend Rio was on her doorstep. She kissed her, was holding her, in front of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio tried to understand how Agatha fucked her the way she did. Each kiss (Which would turn into a few millions down the line) was so fierce as if Agatha was trying to pour every inch of love into her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Well," Rio smirked, admiring the way Agatha's little snort made her tears push out more. "Like I said, I want you..and I'll be whatever you want me to be for you"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smiled, leaning her cheek into Rio's touch, unable to rip her gaze of wonder off the woman. The blissful moment was short lived, but not in a bad way like Rio momentarily worried. She watched as Agatha stood up taller, smile faded as her face contorted into the scrunched, stiff look. The one where she was certainly overthinking.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, but..” Agatha started. “You're not giving up that job, Rio. And I can't uproot that boy in his senior year. So, how- What- I don't get how we-"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio hushed her softly, shaking her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Easy, mi amor. You're three marathons ahead right now” She softly smiled. “Just, exist. Be in the moment with me”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha's bottom lip started to quiver, shaking her head as her voice trembled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah, but…what if the distance breaks this and we already wasted time and-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha” Rio whispered, tilting the woman's face for their eyes to meet. “It's us…we went an entire year not speaking and still found ourselves here. We can go a bit longer" She assured. "I'll take weekends here, we'll call each night, hell- I'll sleep while on the phone with you if that's what you want!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha couldn't help but snicker over the idea. Sleep on a phone call together? That was so stupid..
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      (Agatha wouldn't be able to sleep without Rio on the phone by the following week).
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We'll be okay,” Rio assured. “Things will work out the way they're supposed to. I will make sure of it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She leaned forward, pressing her forehead against Agatha's with a cheeky grin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I left you once…you're never getting rid of me now”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed, but still smiled like a fool as she whispered in return,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe I regret my decision”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mm, nope” Rio hummed, fingertips drumming against her skin. “No backsies”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Backsies?! What are you, twelve?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If I am, that makes you the ultimate creep. Jail time for you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shut up!"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groaned, pushing the woman off to try and walk away, but Rio pulled her right back in. Not that she had to use much strength. Agatha was already leaning back into the expected pull.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They giggled as their lips started to peck one another a few times before dissolving into a lingering kiss. Agatha felt more confident the longer Rio kissed her, held her. Though the disbelief she was back in her life remained strong. She wasn't sure if that'd ever go away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mom! Do you know where my hiking boots are?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha muttered a few curse words into the kiss. She shivered as Rio giggled and vibrated against her lips, nearly melting into the sound as well. She gave her an apologetic look, but not that Rio needed it. Nicky wasn't just her new lover's kid. He was basically her son as well. The disruption wasn't something surprising or unexpected at all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You literally put them away yourself, Nicholas!” Agatha yelled back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicholas was silent for a second, leaving Rio to mutter a low,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "You know he put them in the most obvious spot, right?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Yeah, I-"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio! Do you know where my boots-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed, leaning away to extend her neck as she yelled,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She hasn't even been here in a year!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio belted out a laugh. The memories of Nicky switching to her when Agatha didn't offer an answer he wanted masked the pain of reality. How she hadn't stepped foot into this house, Agatha's life, in a year. Maybe it was because as the two souls she loved most bickered back and forth, how Agatha loved her back, the way they kissed like giddy teens experiencing love for the first time. All of it was a miracle, a blessing that healed her heart in ways she never expected.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'll be right there!” Rio called back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snapped her head over, her frown drooped as she pouted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stop pouting,” Rio smirked. “Sooner we get him on his way, sooner you have me to yourself”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shrugged. She had a point, but her lips still tingled, craving Rio's louder than before.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Besides, missed finding his shit in two seconds. Earns me bragging points”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, shoving the woman to the side with a strong,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Go,” She said. "Saving me from having to find them, anyway"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughed, pecking her lips before nearly running up the stairs. Agatha couldn't help but smile at the way she ran. Not only because Rio was in her house, but she knew how much Nicky missed her. Part of her wondered if the boots were actually lost. Nicky was known to make up things to get what he wanted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      ...Agatha had NO idea where that came from. He must've picked that trait up from some stranger.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm going to find them in five minutes,” Rio called down the hallway to him.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You won't!” He yelled back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, wiping the surprise tears that were left over from the others. She made her way to the kitchen, listening to the soft bickering upstairs with a grin that only grew wider. The familiar noise she always loved (Or hated, depending on the day and if she had a migraine) held a deeper meaning than before. It felt different knowing Rio wasn't just her friend. They hadn't put a label on what they were doing, but she knew nothing would be the same in the best way possible.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For the woman who was terrified of the day Rio ever learned she loved her- Agatha smiled to herself. If only there was a time machine. She could go back, tell the younger her there was nothing to be afraid of. Sure, she still feared the future. The distance between them, the new life they were about to step into. Part of her wondered if it'd change everything for the worse.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But when Rio kissed her? Everything stopped.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her brain went silent, the world around her settled, and something in her soul took a sigh that felt like she was at home. With the bickering voices up the stairs, her heart sang in ways it hadn't in so long. She was grabbing the bottle of wine when her favorite part of the familiar memory came to life,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my god, are you blind?!” Rio exclaimed. “That's it. I'm taking you to get glasses-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wha-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They were right next to your dresser! Like, in your face!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I wasn't looking there!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What? Were you too busy looking up your ass?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No! I was trying to forget the image of you making out with my mom”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Shit.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha held tight onto the bottle, her heart thumping wild as she felt anxiety hit her like a tornado. It wrecked through, spiraled and created chaos in the warmth her heart had worked on settling her down to. She couldn't tell if he meant it in a bad way and the few seconds of silence (Which felt like hours) didn't help answer it either. Was Rio okay? Was Nicky okay? Would they all be okay-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Watch it, Stacy's Mom lyrics will change to Nicky's Mom” Rio warned.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ew! No!” Nicky groaned.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio let out an evil laugh, her voice louder as they exited his room back into the hall.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm singing that to all your friends. Oh my god, first day of senior year! Nicky's Mom has got it going on-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Get out!” The boy yelled with a laugh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha listened to not only them, but her heart settling and the storm washing away. The calm took back over, her smile grew as things above fell to their floor and their feet were running all over. She swore, sometimes Rio was a teenage boy herself with the antics. But, it only made Agatha love her more. Especially when she was making Nicky scream out in laughter. The woman shook her head, suddenly remembering her part in the familiar scene. The infamous line in the script that she missed saying.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She put the bottle of wine down before running to the base of the stairs. Her fingers held the railing while the other hand pressed against the wall. She counted down the seconds, wsaiting for the inevitable,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Go back to California!"
     </span>
    </p>

     <em>

     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "That's not what your mom said"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>

    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky yelled as he bashed into the wall, back on his feet as he was heading for the stairs. Agatha grinned as she yelled out,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "So help me, if one of you fall down these stairs-"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "You're not cleaning the mess up, we know!" They yelled in sync before Rio was heard charging after him.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman knew she would spend years in disbelief they found their way to one another. If you asked her over the last year, hell just two weeks ago if she ever saw them here- Agatha would laugh in your face. Especially over the small vacation. Agatha was sure they would keep spinning in circles, unable to find their way out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But as she leaned against the wall with a smile so warm Agatha was sure to give herself a fever. The chaos upstairs that-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Shatter.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha's eyes opened, grin faded into an annoyed frown. She warned them time and time again to not break things. The woman groaned,
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Why is it always lamps-"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Rio did it!"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "I didn't do it!"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The two voices cut her off in sync, both falling into another argument- This time hushed whispers and trying to make a plan how to fix it. Agatha knew she had to go upstairs, but this time? There was no bad cop. She'd smile like a fool, wave it off, lecture them slightly, but ultimately push Nicky to go pack. The woman pushed herself off the wall, making her way up and hearing the two whisper harsher by the second.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha paused at the top, looking down the hall to see the shadow of them in her bedroom doorway. She pulled her lips back, two words in her mind echoed and bounced all over in joy...

       Hello, hi. So. This was going to be a one shot, but now a two part because it just spiraled into something more than just a jealous Agatha ordeal LMAO. I'm hoping anyone who reads this enjoys it as much as I have writing it. I'm really excited for you guys to see part two of this.
