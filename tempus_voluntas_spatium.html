<div class="userstuff">
<p>PART ONE: RIO</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a couple of lifetimes ago when Rio had last touched these marl brick walls, textured by weather and students who’d chisel their names or profanities in with their nails. It had always been considered a rite of passage, really, to carve your initial and your first love’s somewhere in a yet unmarred spot— preferably as out of reach as possible, should another misbehaving student get tasked with cleaning up and polishing the outside castle walls. </p><p>Rio had never been fortunate enough to find someone she wanted to immortalize herself with, but she would never allow herself to mourn having missed out on the experience; which is why now, twenty years after graduating from this very school, she traces a faded ‘<em>Rio rockz!’ </em> with her thumb, a fond smile on her face.<br/><br/>“Miss Vidal?”<br/><br/>Rio looks up when she hears her name, and watches an older witch with long, grey curly hair walk down the impressive stone stairs that lead from the heavy oak entrance doors to the castle grounds. Her ochre cloak flutters around her surprisingly swift ankles, but what draws Rio’s attention the most is the large blue-black raven flanking the witch, his wingspan wide enough to cover the entirety of the stairs with just one flap.<br/><br/>“Castor informed me of your tardy arrival. I must have overestimated you by expecting you would show up on the premises at the agreed upon time.”<br/><br/>The moment the grey witch takes the last step, she raises her right hand and the raven dives down: he transforms into a ray of silver light, shooting for the witch’s chest like an arrow through the sky, eventually disappearing into her necklace which buzzes and glows faintly before eventually returning to its original state. </p><p>Rio bows her head in embarrassment. “I’m sorry, miss Calderu. I swear I must’ve gotten lost somewhere—”<br/><br/>“Don’t try to fool me, miss Vidal. I don’t think I was ever lucky enough to call myself a witness to your punctual attendance for one of my classes, during the entire six years you were a student at this school.”<br/><br/>Lilia Calderu stands in front of her with a disappointed look on her face, arms crossed and eyebrows raised in anticipation of an explanation. </p><p>“I’m sorry, miss Calderu,” Rio says again, digging the pointy tip of her boot into a groove between the cobblestones beneath her feet. </p><p>“And miss Vidal?”<br/><br/>“Yeah?”<br/><br/>Rio watches the other witch’s stern look melt into one of the warmest smiles she has ever seen.<br/><br/>“It’s Lilia, now. It’s good to have you back, child. Welcome home.” </p><p>Lilia spreads her arms and gestures for Rio to step in for a hug, which she gratefully does: and when burying her nose in the crook of the older witch’s neck, she gets completely engulfed in the all too familiar scent of jasmine incense and something that reminds her of cinnamon rolls.<br/><br/>“I’m not a child anymore, miss Calderu,” Rio mumbles into her hair, “Er— Lilia.”<br/><br/>“How long has it been?”<br/><br/>“Twenty years.”<br/><br/>“Still a child,” Lilia concludes, and Rio squeezes her old professor a little harder.<br/><br/>When the two break apart, Lilia’s hands wrap around Rio’s upper arms as she steps back, giving her the opportunity to take her in.<br/><br/>“You look hungry,” she says, her tone leaving no room for discussion. “Let’s get you to the teacher’s lounge. I’ll have Pietro bring up your suitcases and conjure up some food.”<br/><br/>“Pietro?”<br/><br/>“Remember Wanda Maximoff’s brother? He never passed his graduation exams, but he got offered a job as a janitor. Do you want the tour, or do you remember your way around?”<br/><br/>Even though this castle has been Rio’s home for eight years, some of her memories are murky.<br/><br/>“I’d love the tour.”<br/><br/>“Naturally.”<br/><br/>Lilia beams and slides one of her hands down to squeeze Rio’s hand. With the other, she touches her own necklace again, and it starts glowing before her raven familiar materializes on her outstretched arm.<br/><br/>“Hello Castor,” Rio greets him, offering the back of her index finger for him to nip at. When he carefully takes her finger in his sharp beak, he visibly relaxes.<br/><br/>“Rio,” his low croaky voice sounds, his throat bobbing. Rio laughs, and nods. “Rio,” he says in confirmation.<br/><br/>She knows Castor can’t actually talk to humans, but that doesn’t stop him from remembering and mimicking the name of ever human he’s ever met.<br/><br/>Castor lets go of her finger and turns to Lilia, who tells him to “<em>get Pietro, my dear.” </em> He claps his beak in understanding, and flies off without another word.<br/><br/>Leaving Rio’s suitcases behind, the two women walk up the stairs to the large double entrance doors. There’s a brief unsettling, itchy feeling in Rio’s stomach before Lilia spreads her hands in front of her and murmurs: <em> “Futurum sit praesens.” </em><br/><br/>The right door clicks open outward and Lilia steps aside, gesturing for Rio to enter first. “Welcome back to Orion Academy.”<br/><br/>The second Rio crosses the threshold, she gets hit with a wave of both nostalgia and confusion: the general structure of the main hall is still the same, but the interior design has completely changed from how she remembers it.<br/><br/>Orion Academy had always been quite a dark place, decorated with moody tapestries, minimal candles and stained glass windows. Now, the whole area seems way brighter and more welcoming: the windows have been replaced by transparent glass, letting actual daylight in; most of the tapestries have been replaced by black and white class photos of graduates; and floating fairy lights – which seem to be humming tunes – cast an inviting glow over the entire space. <br/><br/>The biggest difference and newest additions are the three large pillars in the center of the space. A silver one on the left, a golden one in the middle, and a bronze one on the right. Each pillar is adorned with individual, colorized photos of what seem to be current students, some of them magically popping out and reappearing a bit higher or lower on the pillar in real time.<br/><br/>“You’ll find that some things look a little different, since the passing of headmistress Harkness,” Lilia responds to Rio’s surprised look when she enters the building after her.<br/><br/>Before she can help herself, Rio snorts. “It was about time for that old hag Evawhora to finally—”<br/><br/>Lilia silences her with a reprimanding look, but her features soften quickly. “<em>Evanora </em> definitely had some dated ways of handling things.”<br/><br/>Rio nods slowly as the two of them walk down the main hall past the pillars, toward a large spiral staircase. Evanora Harkness, her old headmistress, had been the one and only reason Rio had declined earlier job offers from Orion. Despite some of her best childhood memories having happened at the Academy, Mrs. Harkness hadn't exactly made Rio’s life any easier when she was still a student, and she couldn’t imagine having to work for her as an adult.<br/><br/>“Her passing caused for multiple new teachers to join the team, like yourself,” Lilia explains when they start their ascent. “So in many ways, things have started to change around here.”<br/><br/>“For the better?” Rio asks, and it’s more of an assumption, but Lilia slows down as they reach the landing and she places her hands on the banister. Overlooking the main hall from up here, her lips press together in a thin line before she nods in agreement.<br/><br/>“Perhaps the most important transformation the school has gone through, is the way the student departments work,” she explains with a royal wave of her hand toward the three pillars.<br/><br/><em> Student departments. </em> That does sound new.<br/><br/>“The department a student gets placed in, corresponds to the new dormitories we had built. There are three; each with their own head teacher.”<br/><br/>During Rio’s time as a student, classes and dormitories had been based on sex only: girls and boys. That had always seemed terribly outdated.<br/><br/>“So, what, do queer people get separated from the rest now?” Rios asks, a hint of defensiveness in her voice.<br/><br/>“Nothing like that, dear. Evanora hated queers. Our new headmistress <em> loves </em> them."<br/><br/>Rio is not sure she understands what Lilia means by that, but before she can ask, the older witch continues.<br/><br/>“Bronze houses students from Alnitak. The silver department’s name is Alnilam. And gold is called Mintaka.”<br/><br/>“Like Orion’s stars,” Rio remembers, earning herself a praising smile from Lilia.<br/><br/>“Divination was never your best subject, but at least you still know your way around the universe.”<br/><br/>“So what do the departments stand for? Are students separated based on their abilities or traits?” </p><p>Lilia looks distracted as she softly huffs while watching one of the portraits, of a boy with brown hair and brown eyes, disappear from his spot high on the silver pillar. He reappears a few feet lower.<br/><br/>As Lilia takes in the golden and bronze pillar too, Rio’s eyes drift from the boy’s portrait to a large window on the other side of the landing, overlooking the lush courtyard. Despite it being a bright and sunny day, it looks like it’s raining– or even snowing. Upon a more focused look, Rio realizes she’s watching blossoms drift by, a soft lilac and pale green in color, falling from two impressively large overhanging trees in the center. The trees look like their branches reach out for each other, never quite able to touch, their heartbreak causing their blossoms to drop like tears.<br/><br/>“Of course not,” Lilia answers, tearing her eyes away from the portraits to look back at Rio. “Our new headmistress thought it was terribly counterproductive to put students with the same personality type together. And I agree— that’s just asking for polarization and underdeveloped interpersonal skills.”<br/><br/>Rio feels the tip of her ears turn pink and makes a mental note to not read any of her high fantasy fiction books anymore. “So what is it?”<br/><br/>To her surprise, Lilia shrugs. “Siblings get separated. Friends can stay together if they wish. Other than that, it’s completely random.”<br/><br/>“So why separate them at all?”<br/><br/>“Our students will inevitably identify with their department. It causes a sense of competitiveness, giving them control over their own education and responsibility. Grades and behavior get rewarded and penalized individually,” Lilia explains, once again waving her hand in the direction of the pillars, “So they gain points and rank themselves. This way, for group projects or extracurriculars, we can make students with equal scores work together.”<br/><br/>Lilia turns away from the banister and walks toward one of the doors on top of a second set of stairs across the landing.<br/><br/>“Is that how classes work, too?” Rio asks, skipping a few steps to follow Lilia.<br/><br/>“No,” the older witch says, placing her hand on the door handle. Now that they’re closer, Rio notices a carving in the wood: a large O with three diagonal dots in the center, the logo of Orion Academy.<br/>“Classes <em> are </em> based on abilities, because that’s just more convenient. Whenever a witch shows their first sign of their element, that’s how their main subject gets determined.”<br/><br/>Rio nods in understanding; this sounds more like what she’s used to. She herself had started showing signs of green witchcraft very early on, when she was still a child. From the first day she had attended Orion, botany had been her main subject, which meant those classes consisted of energetic magic for her. All other classes — like potions, protection, divination — were still in her curriculum, but consisted of practical magic.<br/><br/>“Does that mean I will teach both the energetic and the practical classes?” Rio wants to confirm.<br/><br/>“Yes,” Lilia nods. “A deep dive into intuitive botany with your green apprentices, and lessons in practical plant care for the others.” </p><p>The door opens with a creak and the two women step out into a large, round space with lots of natural light coming in through the overgrown glass roof. Two witches, both of around Rio’s age, share a table in the middle of the room and look up when Lilia closes the door behind them. </p><p>“Ah, Jennifer, Alice— good to see you here! This is the newest addition to our team, Rio Vidal.”<br/><br/>The two witches, who had been hunched over two cups of tea, look up as Rio and Lilia approach them.<br/><br/>“What’s up? I’m Alice,” says the shorter but edgier witch. “Jen is trying to read my tea leaves but accidentally forgot she’s completely incompetent.”<br/><br/>“Excuse me?” says the other witch, who has gorgeous, glowing skin. “This takes patience, and you have none.”<br/><br/>“You just told me that I’m about to get robbed by a rogue salamander at wandpoint.”<br/><br/>Rio isn’t sure if she should join in on the conversation, but steps closer to glance into the tea cup anyway. “I don’t know, it looks like a raisin to me,” she says hesitantly.<br/><br/>“If I get robbed by a raisin and die, I swear I’m coming back to haunt you all.” Alice lifts her cup to her mouth and loudly slurps up the remaining liquid, wincing when the sludge hits her lips.<br/><br/>“You’d be <em> raisin’ </em> some questions for sure,” Rio quips before she can help herself.<br/><br/>It earns her two snorts and a fond eye roll.<br/><br/>“Rio, huh?” says the not-so-great-at-tea leaves witch, “Jennifer. Charmed.”<br/><br/>Jennifer takes her in with a warm smile, her eyes never leaving Rio’s. Before she can get a chance to grow uncomfortable, Jennifer’s glowing skin sparks familiarity.<br/><br/>“Wait— Jennifer? As in, Jenny Kale?” Rio stammers, trying her hardest not to be starstruck.<br/><br/>“The one and only,” Jennifer nods. The absence of any humbleness becomes blatantly apparent.<br/><br/>“Here we fucking go,” Alice says, crossing her arms and slumping further into her chair. Lilia just chuckles as she offers Rio a cup of tea too, by raising her brows and pointing at the kettle. Rio licks her dry lips and nods gratefully.<br/><br/>“Didn’t you… own a boutique in France?” Rio asks Jennifer, trying to sound unsure to hide her excessive knowledge of the name Jennifer Kale.<br/><br/>“I still do.” Jennifer pulls out a chair to invite Rio to sit next to her. “In Paris, to be exact. And Stockholm, Milan, Tokyo, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Los Angeles and New York. Just as many locations as I’ve won OMA awards. Awards for—”<br/><br/>“Outstanding Magical Abilities,” Rio finishes eagerly.<br/><br/>“Yes,” Jennifer says, surprised but impressed. “Which is a complete coincidence. However, if I happen to win another, I do have a beautiful location in Sydney in mind…” </p><p>“So why switch to teaching?” Rio wants to know. She looks up and thanks Lilia when she puts a steaming cup of tea in front of her, smiling when she feels a squeeze on her shoulder.<br/><br/>“Magical skincare has been a passion for a long time, but I turn 250 next year,” Jennifer starts to explain.<br/><br/>“Don’t look a day over 248,” Alice murmurs softly, hiding a grin in her empty cup.<br/><br/>“I felt a call to inspire the next generation of witches,” Jennifer continues as if the interruption hadn’t happened, but Rio hears the stomp of a foot under the table, followed by a muffled groan from Alice.<br/><br/>As Rio sips her tea – jasmine, <em> damn, it’s good </em> – Jennifer gestures to the wall behind her. Only now Rio notices a row of large, nearly floor-to-ceiling portraits, all framed by what look like magical tendrils in different colors.<br/><br/>“So when Lilia wrote to me, I figured I would be doing the school a service by adding my portrait to the professor’s wall.”<br/><br/>Rio lets out a low whistle as she gets up from her chair to take a closer look at the portraits, closing her fingers around her teacup to take it with her.<br/><br/>Jennifer’s has her posed at an angle; a smug smile on her face and her hand and fingers up in the <em> aquam </em> position— the gesture for summoning and controlling the element of water. Her rose colored dress stands out beautifully against the blue magical frame and background.<br/><br/>“Stunning,” Rio whispers, more to herself, but Jennifer clearly appreciates the compliment when she lets out an approving sound.<br/><br/>Taking a few more sips of her tea, Rio wanders along the wall, admiring various portraits of unfamiliar but powerful looking faces, both male and female witches. She stops when she recognizes Alice’s.<br/>Her pose is full frontal, hands in her pocket, and a cocky but challenging eyebrow raised. Her exposed arms show multiple protection runes, but the one that’s partly visible on the back of her right hand stands out the most. Rio recognizes it as the glyph for <em> ignem— </em> summoning fire. Alice’s background and frame are a bright, aggressive red.<br/><br/>“Impressive,” Rio remarks, and Alice doesn’t seem to hate the admiration either.<br/><br/>Right next to Alice’s portrait is Lilia’s: fierce in expression but soft in her aura. She wears her trademark Sicilian robes with pride and elegance, and upon a closer look, Rio notices the cross-stitched ravens on the collar. Down the buttons, along the hem of the robes, a word is spelled out: <em> aeris. </em> Lilia’s divination powers come from her abilities as an air-witch, emphasized by the yellow frame and background.<br/><br/>“Wow, Lilia,” Rio says, her mouth curved down in awe, “you don’t just look like a witch. You look like… a deity.”<br/><br/>Lilia smiles mysteriously and slowly approaches Rio by the wall. “So do you, dear.”<br/><br/>Soft hands land on her shoulders and carefully turn her toward another portrait on the far right of the wall.<br/><br/>The background and magical frame on this portrait are a deep green in color. Her own pose is relaxed but alert, and she playfully holds up a single orchid between her index and middle finger. Her other hand extends down to the ground, fingers curled in readiness to manipulate the earth: <em> terram. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> Rio’s breath catches. She <em> does </em> look god-like, which immediately causes a rush of discomfort in her chest. This display of her beauty and her power, it doesn’t feel real. Doesn’t feel deserved.<br/><br/>Her eyes frantically search her own portrait’s features, desperate for a sign to ground her, to counter the exponentially growing imposter syndrome inside of her. But when she locks onto her own eyes, she sees it: just a flash of insecurity readable in her brown irises, the tiniest speck of doubt, of vulnerability. Not apparent to anyone casually admiring the portrait, but definitely there, and just the thing she needs to see to be able to connect herself to this image of her which otherwise feels so foreign.<br/><br/>“That’s, um…”<br/><br/>“I know,” Lilia says empathically, squeezing her shoulder once more before taking the empty tea cup from Rio’s trembling hands. “It’s a lot. But you’re a part of the team now, and hopefully, soon you’ll feel right at home here.”<br/><br/>Rio exhales deeply as she walks back to her chair, rubbing her temple with two fingers.<br/><br/>“You gonna read her tea leaves, Lilia?” Alice grins, and when Rio turns she realizes that her old divination teacher is staring deeply into her teacup, slowly tilting it to make the light hit it better.<br/><br/>“I’m not sure I want a free reading,” Rio groans, shielding her eyes with her hands like blinders on a horse. When she turns back, the tunnel vision her hands create causes her eyes to land on the opposite wall, where a singular, even larger portrait takes up the majority of the space. </p><p>“Who is <em> that?” </em> Rio blurts out, awestruck by the intimidating pose of the witch surrounded by a purple background and magical frame. The portrait faces the viewer head-on, and both of her hands are cupped upward at waist height, suggesting the effortless way she conjures up the wild purple magic from her palms.<br/><br/>“Orion’s new headmistress,” Jennifer says, her voice weirdly soft, almost as if whispering out of respect. “I’m sure you’ll meet her soon.”<br/><br/>Rio’s eyes drift from the purple witch’s hands up past her tailored teal cloak, and she swallows at the headmistress’ expression. There’s a dangerous smirk on her face, and the way her chin is slightly tilted up exudes an unfathomable amount of power. Even her long, brown hair cascading down her back and shoulders, add to the natural prevalence of this breathtaking witch.<br/><br/>“What’s her name?” Rio tries to ask casually, failing miserably if the crack in her voice is any indication.<br/><br/>“Agatha,” Jennifer answers, but her voice sounds distant as Rio is still captivated by the portrait.<br/><br/>The headmistress’ element isn’t as apparent in her portrait as it is in that of the other professors, but when Rio locks onto her lively sea blue eyes, she almost gets sucked in while a whispered voice breezes in her ear: “<em>Spiritum.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “Agatha?” Rio repeats, trying out the feel of the name on her tongue. “Agatha.”<br/><br/>Why does that sound so familiar?<br/><br/>It doesn’t take more than a few seconds for Rio’s eyes to go wide. “Agatha… wait— As in Agatha <em> Harkness?” </em><br/><br/>“That would be her.”<br/><br/>A deep, feminine voice makes Rio whip around to face the headmistress in the flesh, as if she had suddenly materialized out of thin air. Her hands are pocketed in the same teal coat she’s wearing in her portrait, and there’s a profoundly unimpressed look on her face.<br/><br/>“You’re late.”<br/><br/>“Mrs. Harkness, I’m sorry—” Rio stammers, wildly thrown off guard and humbled by the presence of the <em> daughter </em> of the person she had been making fun of earlier.<br/><br/>“It’s Agatha. Mrs. Harkness is my mother, may her soul eternally deep-fry in the tenth circle of hell.”<br/><br/>Okay, cool. So luckily for Rio, the new headmistress, despite being directly related to her, isn’t a huge fan of Evanora either. Cool, cool.<br/><br/>Now she just has to say something cool to win her over.<br/><br/>“Cool.”<br/><br/>Not that.<br/><br/>“Had you been on time, you could’ve used the remaining time of the day to work on your embarrassingly meager vocabulary. But alas,” Agatha looks her up and down, “your wardrobe is in an even more urgent need of attention.”<br/><br/>Rio jolts at the unexpected jab and looks down at herself, one knee slightly buckling as she takes in her own worn out leggings. The apples of her cheeks start to burn. </p><p>“I expect you to tend to that before your first class in the morning. Your uniform will be delivered to your quarters.”<br/><br/>Taking away any privilege of being perceived, Agatha tears her eyes from Rio and strides toward her own portrait, which swings open as she approaches. It reveals another set of stairs, but Rio can’t see much more as the portrait immediately blocks the entrance once Agatha has stepped through.<br/><br/>“You’ll get used to her,” Alice says in pity, very much aware of the vocal roasting Rio had just endured.<br/><br/>“Is she always like that?” Rio asks, still staring at the headmistress’ portrait like she will reappear any second.<br/><br/>“I’m afraid so. But I swear she’s a hundred times better than her mother.”<br/><br/>“I think I’m in love with her.”<br/><br/>Alice starts coughing to cover up her surprise as Jen cackles out a string of unrelated vowels.<br/><br/>“You might want to tone down your masochistic tendencies around her, because I’m not sure she’ll—”<br/><br/>Jennifer gets interrupted by a loud gasp from the other side of the room. The three witches turn to Lilia, who apparently had been staring into Rio’s teacup the whole time.<br/><br/>Just as Rio wants to ask her if she’s okay, Lilia’s body convulses and her eyes turn an eerie silvery-white.<br/><br/><em> “A new moon, the night is prime.” </em><br/><br/>Lilia’s voice is raspy and she looks up from the cup, her unfocused eyes staring into the distance as she repeats herself.<br/><br/><em> “A new moon, the night is prime. The first is born.” </em><br/><br/>Almost as if in a practiced routine, Alice gets up from her chair and walks over to Lilia to take the cup from her hands and softly caress her scalp through her grey curls.<br/><br/>“She gets these sometimes,” Jennifer explains, not alarmed at all.<br/><br/>Rio watches the scene with a furrow in her brow— she doesn’t recall Lilia ever having such intense episodes while experiencing a surge of divination. “Is… is she okay?” she asks carefully.<br/><br/>“Is who okay?” Lilia shudders one last time, her eyes turn back to their normal color and she looks up at Rio as if nothing happened.<br/><br/>“You,” Alice chuckles as she keeps stroking Lilia’s hair. “You had one, again.”<br/><br/>“Oh! What’d I say?” Lilia asks with an, according to Rio, misplaced sense of excitement.<br/><br/>“You said: A new moon. The night is prime. The first is born.”<br/><br/>Lilia rolls her eyes and sighs in defeat. “So another nonsense one. Bah. I get so tired of those.” She throws up her hands, which Alice takes as a sign that she is in fact okay, so she returns to the table.<br/><br/>“Let me take you to your quarters, dear,” Lilia says to Rio, her soft comforting smile having returned to her face. “I’m going to let you guess how to get there. It’s quite genius, actually—”<br/><br/>“Through there?” Rio guesses, pointing at her own portrait, a tight knot in her stomach.<br/><br/>“How did you… yes. Yes, through there. Come on, let’s see if Pietro has managed to bring up your belongings.”</p>

<p>Rio is not an early riser.<br/><br/>Despite that, she finds herself awake and showered by 5.30am, her body too overwhelmed to catch an entire night’s worth of sleep. </p><p>At 5.35am, she has made her way down the stairs, through her portrait, across the teacher’s lounge, and out into the castle hallways. The sun has just risen, but no one else appears to be awake. The only sound comes from the humming fairy lights, which, now that she’s the only one here, seem to follow her around and light her path wherever she goes.<br/><br/>Even though the castle interior looks so different from how she remembers it, the labyrinth that makes up the floor plan is still the same. Her legs guide her as she doesn’t quite know where they’re taking her, but she’s in no hurry to be anywhere. She breathlessly admires the bronze, silver and golden details and can’t help but notice the regality of Agatha Harkness’ influence in these design choices.<br/><br/>Glancing through the window overlooking the courtyard, she notices the large trees with overhanging branches again. Their blossoms are still falling, but less intensely so than they were last night. It’s almost as if they’re… calmer.<br/><br/>“The courtyard...” Rio murmurs out loud, trying to actively remember her way through the castle. To her surprise, the floating fairy lights above her head start blinking and shoot forward in a straight line to map out a path for her, not unlike the emergency lights inside an airplane.<br/><br/>She can’t stop the amazed giggle from escaping from her throat: “Oh— thanks guys.” </p><p>The lights hum contently. </p><p>Rio follows them until she reaches a familiar set of oak doors, different from the ones to the main hall; she remembers that these doors do in fact lead to the courtyard, so she pushes the right one open with her shoulder and steps outside. </p><p>The cold, wet grass tickles her ankles, exposed from under the grey sweatpants she’d thrown on this morning.<br/>A few different versions of her uniform had indeed arrived last night— a few shirts, blazers, both skirt and trouser options— all midnight black with a green rim contouring the hem and the Orion logo stitched onto the breast pockets. Nowhere near fashionable or inspiring, Rio had thought upon a glance at the neatly folded pile on her bed, but she would put them on for the sake of picking her battles. Especially on her first day. Especially with the headmistress.<br/><br/>Rio takes a deep breath and shivers as goosebumps appear on her arms. The early morning is cold, but calm. Calm enough to carefully introduce her oldest friend to their new home.<br/><br/><em> “Amicum animalem evoco.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> A flash of white light shoots from her palm, aimed at a patch of grass a few feet ahead. With an agitated squeak for not having been summoned for over a day, her armadillo materializes and lands on the ground with a soft <em> poof</em>.<br/><br/>“Hey buddy,” Rio speaks softly, scrunching her pants up by the thighs to be able to sit down in the wet grass, legs crossed in front of her. “Wanna come in for a cuddle?”<br/><br/>The armadillo stoically stares at her as she pats the ground.<br/><br/>“I know, I know. You’re mad. But hey, look around— remember this place? This is where we met, Reaper.”<br/><br/>Reaper’s beady eyes flash in recognition, but he doesn’t move.<br/><br/>“No scratches?” Rio asks him, one eyebrow raised. This startles him into action, and he skiddles toward her to jump in her lap. “That’s what I thought.”<br/><br/>His rough skin feels safe and familiar under her fingertips; a very different sensation from the first time she’d connected with him.<br/><br/>Reaper hadn’t always been the confidant he is now. Rio’s memories of the day she got him are old and vague, but she distinctly remembers not being happy about having summoned an <em> armadillo </em>as her familiar. She’d wanted something cool, like a wolf, or a bat. Maybe something cute, like a raccoon or a ferret. But no, Rio Vidal had summoned a fucking hairy basketball with a snout as her protector. </p><p>“Welcome home,” she whispers as she scratches her tiny friend under his chin. He chirps and shudders as he stretches out, clearly trying to show her what his lack of time as a sentient animal with a body has done to him.<br/><br/>“Oh shush,” she tells him. “You know you can’t be out when I travel. Just imagine all of the friends you’re gonna be able to make here!”<br/><br/>Reaper bumps his nose against her finger when he suddenly freezes, his ears perking up in surprise. He wriggles himself free out of Rio’s lap and drops onto the grass, shooting away from her at lightning speed.<br/><br/>“Hey, where are you going?” Rio calls after him, but Reaper runs and runs as fast as his tiny legs can carry him. Rio has no choice but to get up and chase him— goddess knows her little protector needs some protecting himself sometimes.<br/><br/>Reaper zigzags through the tall grass and Rio follows him, swiftly hopping over logs and piles of dirt, half amused and half worried about his sudden inspiration to bolt. She has no idea where he’s going or how long she’ll have to chase him, until finally she sees him hop up and over a tree root, and disappear into a hole.<br/><br/>Rio comes to a halt, one hand on her knee and the other resting against a robust tree trunk— the trunk Reaper has just disappeared in. With a heaving chest to catch her breath, Rio looks up and realizes she’s standing by one of the large blossom trees; the one raining down soft lilac petals.<br/><br/>“Reaper,” she scolds him, getting on her knees with a roll of her eyes, lightly irritated at having to fold herself into this position to recall her stubborn familiar.<br/><br/>The hole in the tree trunk is just large enough for Reaper to have squirmed himself through, but too small and dark for Rio to be able to properly see what’s going on. She has to tilt her torso forward and hold her head nearly upside down to be able to peek inside.<br/><br/>“<em>Lux,” </em> Rio says, and a soft orb of silver light emerges from the palm of her hand, illuminating the entrance of the hole. From the scarce light it casts inside, she can see her armadillo scurrying around.<br/><br/>“What are you doing in there?” Rio says softly, now more intrigued than anything else. She leans even further forward, her head in a strained angle to see more of what’s happening inside. She nudges the energy of the silver orb and it floats through the opening, slowly lighting up the entire inside of the trunk.<br/><br/>A soft gasp escapes her as she witnesses not one, but two small animals inside: Reaper is prodding his clearly riled up nose into the fur of a white-and-caramel-colored, peacefully sleeping rabbit.<br/><br/>Rio immediately wants to recall her familiar to not disturb the rabbit, but it’s too late: another prod of Reaper’s nose startles the animal awake, and the glowing orb makes it freeze in fear. Rio quickly distinguishes the light with a snap of her fingers, but that draws the rabbit’s attention to her, scaring it into hopping and stomping around in the hollow tree trunk like a maniac.<br/><br/>“Oh! Sorry!” Rio squeaks, laden with guilt over having aggressively woken up the bunny; but when she reflexively tears herself up and away from the entrance, she bonks her head against one of the tree’s branches.<br/><br/>“Ow! Son of a—”<br/><br/>Her hand flies to the back of her head, squinting the pain away, but the more she blinks, the darker it gets. It takes only a few seconds to realize it’s because a tall figure is standing in front of her, blocking the sun and casting a shadow.<br/><br/>“Miss Vidal.”<br/><br/>Agatha, in a long, black robe and her long hair messily cascading down her back, does <em> not </em> look pleased.<br/><br/>“Mrs Ha— Agatha,” Rio says dumbly, still rubbing the back of her skull.<br/><br/>“It’s not even been 24 hours since you arrived on my premises, and you have already managed to disturb the peace around here.”<br/><br/>Agatha wants to say more, but before she can, the bunny emerges from the trunk, eyes wide and body shivering. Rio expects him to flee now that he’s in the outside air, but to her great surprise he hops toward Agatha, pressing his face against her ankle.<br/><br/>Rio’s eyes shift from the rabbit up to Agatha’s highly disapproving glare.<br/><br/>“What a sorry excuse for a green witch,” Agatha sneers, her face scrunched like she’s smelling something foul. “Disrespectful. Disruptive.”<br/><br/>Rio feels her cheeks darken as she tries to find the right words. “Well— I'm sorry, I didn’t mean to, but my—”<br/><br/>As if on cue, Reaper emerges from the hole, not hindered by any of the tension around him. Instead, he locks on to the rabbit by Agatha’s feet, and waddles toward him once more.<br/><br/>“Reaper, no! Come here!” Rio hisses, but her familiar doesn't listen: the rabbit opens his mouth at him, and <em> growls. </em>And the rabbit’s not the only one affected— Agatha recoils at the sight of the armadillo and takes a step back in disgust. </p><p>“<em>Redi ad me,” </em> Agatha calls out, and the rabbit turns into a sliver of purple magic, disappearing straight into her chest like a snapping elastic band.<br/><br/><em> Oh, </em> the rabbit is her familiar. <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> Oh— Fuck. The rabbit is <em> her </em> <em>fucking familiar.</em><br/><br/>“Get— that— <em> thing— </em> away from me,” Agatha says through clenched teeth, eyes fixed on the confused armadillo by her ankles. Reaper is frantically looking around in search of the rabbit who had suddenly vanished in front of his eyes.<br/><br/>“That <em> thing </em> has a name,” Rio says, slightly offended as she scrambles up, dusting her knees to not look Agatha in the eyes. In the silence, she can <em> hear </em> it clicking in the headmistress’ brain.<br/><br/>“He— <em> he’s yours?!” </em><br/><br/>Rio’s gaze snaps up, ready to fight whatever mean comment the woman in front of her is about to make about Reaper, headmistress or not.<br/><br/>“Disgusting,” Agatha says haughtily, shaking an ankle in his direction to keep him at a distance. “But I suppose I’m not surprised. Someone like you doesn’t deserve a <em> worthy companion.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> Rio might be a green witch, but the heat building up in her chest feels no less roaring than that of a fully fledged fire witch.<br/><br/>“<em>Redi ad me,” </em> Rio grumbles, and with a flash of green light, her familiar vanishes too, and becomes a part of her again.<br/><br/>“At least Reaper and I have a real bond, born from <em> real talent</em>. Nothing like the nepo baby headmistress who needed to inherit a castle from her whack-ass mother to feel like she <em> is </em> somebody.”<br/><br/>Rio looks her up and down while the words she’d just spoken repeat in her head, and the twitch in Agatha’s left eye makes the confidence behind those words disappear real fucking fast.<br/><br/>She opens her mouth to apologize, but Agatha quietens her with a lifted hand.<br/><br/>“You speak to me like that one more time,” she says in an eerily calm tone, “and I’ll have you thrown into a greenhouse full of carnivorous plants. We’ll see how much <em> real talent </em> you have. Get ready for your classes.”<br/><br/>“Gladly,” Rio huffs, and she turns around to stomp back to the castle, without any intention of giving Agatha any time of day anymore.<br/><br/>She keeps mumbling multiple variations of “<em>raging fucking bitch</em>” all the way up to the teacher’s lounge, where she runs into Jennifer who is calmly chewing her breakfast.<br/><br/>“So, that’s a wrap on your crush?” she smirks at her own assumption, taking another chomp out of her apple.<br/><br/>“She’s a <em> hoot,” </em> Rio growls, brushing right past the water witch. “Lovely personality. Very punchable face, too.”<br/><br/>“Don’t say I didn’t warn you!” Jennifer calls after her when Rio steps through her portrait to retreat up to her quarters.<br/><br/>Still agitated, she steps out of her dirty sweatpants and turns toward the pile of stiff uniform clothes.<br/><br/>“<em>Your wardrobe is in even more urgent need of attention</em>,” she repeats the headmistress’ earlier words in a mocking voice. “Fuck you.”<br/><br/>Rio has never been one for violence. Violence always found <em> her, </em> somehow, but she would never, never think about initiating it.<br/><br/>But that doesn’t mean that Rio, when driven mad, can’t be maliciously compliant.<br/><br/>Selecting a random shirt, blazer, and a pair of trousers from the pile, she spreads them out on the bed.<br/>As a green witch, she can’t summon fire magic, but she has most certainly learned to channel it— which is why she always has a lighter and a candle at the ready.<br/><br/>Once she’s lit the candle, she points at the flame and funnels the fire into the size of a needle through her fingertip, guiding the scorching energy toward the clothes.<br/><br/>Fueled by her anger and her need to prove her own talent, she is determined to make the entire outfit a little bit more… <em> Rio. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> If Agatha wants to question her worthiness, Rio will make sure she won’t be able to get around it anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>**<br/><br/><br/>Her first class that morning is practical botany with a class of non-green first years.<br/><br/>When a group of young water-, fire-, air- and spirit witches, all in black uniforms, shyly shuffle into her classroom, Rio is still occupied with trying to make the space feel a bit more alive, but to no avail. The desolate walls feel like they’re closing in on her, due to the lack of sunlight coming in through the scarce windows, and Rio briefly wonders if Agatha had picked this room for Rio just to piss her off.<br/><br/>The only decoration in the room that doesn’t feel <em> dead </em> is the potted lily she had brought in for her first class.<br/><br/>Well— that has to change.<br/><br/>“Good morning witches,” Rio says when the last student has entered the room. She points at the door and it swings closed with a soft click. As she walks over to the desk in front of the classroom, she slides her blazer off and chucks it over the lone chair behind it. Then she hops onto the desk, and crosses her legs.<br/><br/>“My name’s Rio. Rio Vidal, or— I guess that’s Miss Vidal for you.” She looks around the room to take the little tense faces of her students in, smiling softly.<br/><br/>“I’m just going to take attendance first; if you hear your name, please raise your hand, state your department and specialty element if you already have one, and name one thing you’ll hope you learn in this class.”<br/><br/>Rio ignores the dissatisfied mumbling going around while she picks up one of the papers that had been prepared on her desk.<br/><br/>‘<em>Monday, 9.00am - Botany, practical - 1st Years’ </em> it says at the top, followed by a list of names. Underneath, her next class is <em> ‘Monday, 1.00pm - Botany, energetic - 1st Years’, </em> so she’ll teach the green first years in the afternoon. Her last class of the day says <em> ‘Monday, 3.00pm - Advanced Tectonics, energetic - 6th Years’, </em> which should be interesting, teaching an in-depth class about the earth’s magic to some much older, green students.<br/><br/>“Kalyn Brand?”<br/><br/>A girl with a long black braid in the back of the class raises her hand.<br/><br/>“That’s me! I’m a water witch, and I’m in Mintaka.”<br/><br/>“Welcome to my class, Kalyn, what would you like to learn?”<br/><br/>“Eh— I’d like for my plants to not die?”<br/><br/>A collective chuckle rumbles through the room, but Rio raises her hand to request silence. “That’s— a very achievable goal, I’d say. Next up: Marina Fischer?”<br/><br/>A girl with red hair and a face full of freckles on the other side of the room raises her hand. “Hi Miss Vidal! I’m an air witch, my department is Alnitak, and I’d like to be able to grow my own herbs for my rituals.” <br/><br/>“An excellent use for botany,” Rio nods. “Next— Lou Hannigan?”<br/><br/>A student in the front row with a beautiful wide smile pipes up: “I’m Lou, and my pronouns are they/them. My classmates know how to use them, but it’s still hard for professors to use them sometimes. I don’t mind, but—”<br/><br/>“I got you, Lou. Love the buzzcut, by the way,” Rio says, and Lou starts beaming even brighter.<br/><br/>“My element hasn’t presented itself yet, I’m in Mintaka, and what I’d like to learn— I really just hope I turn out to be a green witch,” Lou continues their introduction solemnly, but Rio senses their insecurity through their words.<br/><br/>“No need to rush it, and I’m sure that whatever element you will present with, will be a great fit for you. As long as you don’t have one yet, you are more than welcome in this class.”<br/><br/>Lou eyes dart sideways to their friend, who nudges them in the ribs as if to say <em> ‘See? Wasn’t so bad!’ </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “Tommy Maximoff?”<br/><br/>The soft murmur in the class dies down until there’s absolute silence for a few seconds, before a boy in the back of the room casually throws up both of his hands.<br/><br/>“You’re looking for me!”<br/><br/>To Rio’s great surprise, the boy throws his feet up on his desk and stretches out languidly.<br/><br/>“Tommy M, spirit witch, Alnilam. And I would like to learn,” he says in a challenging tone, “why the <em> hell </em> your uniform looks so funny.”<br/><br/>A few students in the class start giggling, others gasp breathlessly. Rio is taken aback too by this boy’s audacity, and she looks down at her own clothes— multiple colorful cotton flowers are stitched to the shirt and the trousers, making it only vaguely resemble the original soulless uniform. She feels around for the blazer behind her on the chair and holds it up, showcasing a few scorched out shapes that look a suspicious amount like the flowers stitched onto the rest of her clothes.<br/><br/>“Tommy Maximoff, huh?” Rio says, carefully placing the blazer down next to her and jumping up from the desk, slowly walking toward him. “You don’t happen to have any connections to Wanda Maximoff? Because I could tell you a few stories about her that will make your neck hair stand on end.”<br/><br/>“Auntie Wands!” Tommy says, grinning like a maniac. “You know her? I mean— everybody knows her. But you <em> know </em> know her?”<br/><br/>“I don’t only <em>know</em> her,” Rio says in a mysterious tone, looking around the classroom and reveling in the respect she seems to be generating, “We were classmates.”<br/><br/>Another few audible gasps fill the room, and even Tommy’s face seems to be losing some of its color.<br/><br/>Rio hadn’t planned to share this piece of information on the first day, but with a name like Maximoff in her class, she couldn’t quite let this one go.<br/><br/>She had indeed been in the same class as one of the most notorious witches to this day: Wanda Maximoff. Wanda had been the state’s number one enemy for quite some years, and perhaps even more importantly: untraceable. After allegedly blowing up an entire town just over ten years ago, she had been high on the wanted list in the entire magical community, but was never seen again.<br/><br/>“So she’s your aunt, Tommy?”<br/><br/>Tommy nods slowly, unsure what to say. “But I— I have never actually… <em>met</em> her, you know. Could you tell me— I wanna know those stories, Miss Vidal.”<br/><br/>Rio quirks an eyebrow at how quickly she has gained the upper hand over this not-so rebellious child.<br/><br/>“I might,” she says airily, turning back toward her desk. “If you behave.” She flicks her wrist and while she has her back to Tommy, his chair starts floating, forcing him to take his feet off the table. When he tucks them in, grabbing onto the seat for dear life, his chair drops back to the floor with a loud <em>thud</em>.<br/><br/>“Do we have a deal, Tommy?”<br/><br/>“We have a deal, Miss Vidal.” </p>

<p>The rest of the class goes about as well as Rio had expected from a group of young teenagers. Only one or two of them have an attention span of more than twenty seconds, but Rio knows she isn’t allowed to judge; she wasn’t much better at that age.<br/>
<br/>
The lily seeds she has brought, grow into blooming flowers— or at least most of them do. Some of her young fire students aren’t exactly proving themselves to be masters of their element yet, scorching their growing stems to ashes. The water witches have to be careful not to drown their seeds, but that goes over relatively well; the air witches perform the best by far. Tommy, as the only spirit witch in this class, is taking to testing Rio as opposed to growing his lily.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit witches like him are rare, Rio knows. Unlike the other elements, the element of spirit is a recessive trait, which means both witches involved in the conception of a spirit child need to carry the gene.<br/>
<br/>
Tommy is very likely aware of this fact, as he doesn’t shy away from showcasing his powers for a single second; his specialty being so incredibly fast that time seems to bend around him. Whenever Rio looks for him, either because his chair is empty or a loud crash is audible from the other side of the room, he is nowhere to be found.<br/>
She keeps feeling <em> wooshes </em> and sees blurs of, what she eventually finds out, the young human leaf blower zooming around.<br/>
<br/>
Getting his attention is like catching water with a broken net.<br/>
<br/>
The most frustrating thing about Tommy’s talent for being a menace must be that he doesn’t underperform for his peers. Despite clowning around for almost three hours, he sits down for ten minutes before the end of class, using his talent to grow his lily at ten times the speed his classmates have. His is just a tiny bit larger, too. Fucker.<br/>
<br/>
After having given him multiple of her sternest side eyes, Rio isn’t able to hide an impressed smirk. She makes a mental note to bring more challenging work for him next time.<br/>
<br/>
Five minutes to noon, while the others are still working, Tommy presents his lily to Rio at her desk, his hands wrapped around the pot and a smug smile on his face.<br/>
<br/>
“What do you think, Rio?”<br/>
<br/>
And while Rio usually doesn’t care about titles, she shoots him a reprimanding look. “Miss Vidal,” she corrects him.<br/>
<br/>
“Um, no. My name’s Tommy,” the child says, his smile growing even bigger. Rio sighs and shakes her head to not give him the satisfaction of the amused curve of her lip.<br/>
<br/>
“You did, unfortunately for me, really well, Tommy,” she says reluctantly. Tommy puts his lily on her desk and runs a victory lap around her, making the lily’s leaves and Rio’s hair fluttering in the wind.<br/>
<br/>
“Can I go now?” he asks her, his body already turned toward the door.<br/>
<br/>
Rio knits her eyebrows in surprise. “Go? No, Tommy. Class isn’t over for another five minutes.”<br/>
<br/>
“I know, but I’ve got private tutoring on Mondays.”<br/>
<br/>
“Private tutoring?” Rio crosses her arms. “I’m sure you do. Go sit down, Tommy, and wait for the end of class.”<br/>
<br/>
“But I’m serious!” Tommy whines, his shoulders dropping. “And I can’t be late! I swear, I’m allowed to leave early! Ask the others! Ask Lou, come on!”<br/>
<br/>
Rio huffs. She’s not about to get fooled by a child. “I won’t fall for your pranks, mister. What would you need private tutoring for?”<br/>
<br/>
“Chaos magic,” he mumbles, looking down at his shoes.<br/>
<br/>
“Chaos magic?!” So Rio is supposed to believe that he doesn’t just present as a spirit witch, but he possesses chaos magic as well? She wasn’t born yesterday. “Tommy, chaos magic is a highly advanced and extremely dangerous form of magic. Very, very few witches present with that kind of talent, and almost all of them make it into history books.” <br/>
<br/>
“Exactly!” Tommy gasps, suddenly looking up at her again. “And the last known case of a witch who possesses it...” He gestures for her to fill in the blank.<br/>
<br/>
Rio wrecks her brain for a few seconds, before she realizes: “Wanda.”<br/>
<br/>
Tommy nods vigorously. “<em>Aunt </em> Wanda!” He gestures down at himself, and wiggles his fingers for emphasis.<br/>
<br/>
Well. With his knack for chaos during class, and his familial ties to the most dangerous spirit witch who possessed chaos magic of the last century, there might be a chance he is right after all.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re not lying to me?”<br/>
<br/>
Tommy shakes his head so fast his face turns blurry. “The headmistress teaches us to control it in private. She’s not gonna be happy about me being late…”<br/>
<br/>
<em> Us?! </em> There are more than one?!<br/>
<br/>
And if Agatha is involved, she definitely doesn’t want to antagonize her further by keeping a student from seeing her.<br/>
<br/>
“Fine, go,” Rio sighs. “Because if it’s actually true, and you possess chaos magic, we all better pray you can control it sooner rather than later.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thanks Rio!” he exclaims, and throws his belongings into his backpack so fast, a small tornado forms on his desk.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s Miss Vi— oh, never mind.”<br/>
<br/>
As she looks at her watch and wraps up the class, making all students choose a spot in the room to place their lilies, she hopes that either Tommy can run fast enough to run back in time and make it to Agatha’s office, or that she won’t run into the headmistress for the foreseeable future. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>After her classes, Rio decides to summon her food from the teacher’s lounge and make her way back to the courtyard. Sure, she likes being around other people sometimes, but after seeing so many new faces today, she is in need of some alone time. And she has a familiar to give a stern talking to, after all.<br/>
<br/>
With the route still fresh in mind, she doesn’t need any more guidance to find the large oak doors leading outside. Now that there’s enough daylight coming in through the large castle windows, she takes in more designing details as she walks across the atrium: more pictures of graduates, a replica of the constellation Orion flickering against the ceiling, and an impressing array of plants and flowers, all in large pots in nearly every corner. Even a specific species of her favorite flowers, azaleas, are thriving among the variety of greenery. Impressive, as indoor azaleas require a very precise amount of attention and care.<br/>
<br/>
In the center of the atrium, the light and dark brown colored tiles on the floor are arranged in such a way they form two large creatures: a large dragon, its impressive wings spread, clawed paws hovering above the ground. He seems to be breathing fire from his spread open mouth, straight up into the air— but upon closer look, it doesn’t look like fire exactly. It’s hard to tell with only two colors.<br/>
<br/>
Beside the dragon flies a griffin, just as large, its wingspan covering at least three times Rio’s height. A few of its feathers float around it, one of them caught in the stream of whatever it is the dragon is spewing.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn’t look like they’re fighting, not really— or at least not against each other. The way both of their eyes stare into the distance gives the impression they’re readying themselves for a bigger threat, something not quite there yet.<br/>
<br/>
Rio smiles at the creatures before continuing her way outside. She has always been fascinated by all living things; flowers, plants, animals. But to ever see a mythical creature like a dragon or a griffin with her own eyes— that wouldn’t be a day she’d soon forget. </p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
Once outside, Rio walks around for a few minutes before sitting down on the grass, having found a spot with a nice view of the castle and the mountains behind it. She takes out her container of peanut noodles – her comfort food – and summons a smaller container from the kitchen cupboard in the teacher’s lounge to ladle over a small portion of her meal for Reaper.<br/>
<br/>
Reaper loves noodles too. </p><p>
<em> “Amicum animalem evoco.” </em>
</p><p>Her armadillo skitters around in happiness at being freed, making Rio chuckle at his antics. As she brings her noodles to her mouth with a set of chopsticks, Reaper bumps his nose against her shin to say hello.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey mister,” she laughs. “Are you so happy to see me? Can’t you smell I got you something?” She points the chopsticks to the smaller container on the grass, and slurps her own food into her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Reaper turns around and temporarily freezes at the sight before him. He squeals loudly, waddles over to his bowl, and starts munching away, his little jaws moving at rapid speed.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn’t need food, since he is a part of her— not really. But food can be nourishing for the soul, too.<br/>
<br/>
“I think you and I have something to discuss, don’t we?”<br/>
<br/>
The little animal dips his head into the food container, pretending not to hear her.<br/>
<br/>
“What was that with you and the rabbit this morning, huh?” she accuses him, not sensitive to his deflection tactics. “Since when don’t we leave other animals alone?”<br/>
<br/>
Reaper’s beady eyes stare up at her and his jaws slow down.<br/>
<br/>
“No,” she answers him with a sigh. “I’m not mad at you. I just wanna know why. You got me in trouble, mister. That was the headmistress’ familiar.” She shakes her head as she watches her armadillo blink at her.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah. That mean, evil, raging bitching cunt of a headmistress. I’m glad we’re talking about the same one. Wait, what are you— hey! <em> Ow!” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> She tugs her ankle free from his mouth and looks him down. “What the hell, Reaper?” She stares at him in disbelief as she rubs the faint red mark he left behind; his dull teeth hadn’t broken her skin, but he’d given her a slightly painful nip.<br/>
<br/>
Before she can scoop him up, he runs a few feet away from her and turns around, looking at her with a mischievous glint in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“Reap…” she warns him, “this is not the time to play. We’re having a conversation. And I’m eating.”<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, Rio has as much control over her familiar as she has over her students that morning. Reaper squeaks once more, and takes off across the courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
“No!” Rio shouts. “Not again! Reaper, don’t make me recall you! <em> Reap!” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> His ears flop as he runs, his speed remarkable for someone with such tiny legs.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Redi ad me!” </em> Rio outstretches her hand to make Reaper come back to her, but her familiar has started zigzagging and dodges any magic aimed at him. “<em>Redi ad me! </em> Fuck!"<em>  </em></p><p>She hastily collects the emtpyish food containers and starts to chase after him. There <em> must </em> be something wrong with him— Reaper is usually so well behaved, and now he’s acted out twice in one day.<br/>
<br/>
As long as he stays outside at least, she could consider it involuntary exercise—<br/>
<br/>
But of course, her stubborn familiar makes a mad dash for the oak doors that lead to the atrium.<br/>
<br/>
Rio cursus silently. “Are you <em> fucking </em> kidding— <em> Reap!” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> She has no choice but to follow him; through one of the doors which had been open just a crack, across the atrium, down a long hallway. Her only consolation is that most students have already left for their dormitories, though one or two sixth-year students take her in with an amused smile as she races by.<br/>
<br/>
In order to not lose sight of Reaper, she has to fling herself around corners, slide across the marble floors when he makes a sudden turn, take two steps at a time when he hops down a large stairway.<br/>
<br/>
She is so focused on him, she doesn’t realize she’s entered a part of the castle unfamiliar to her; not even treaded by her while she was still a student. The hallways get darker, the smell mustier, the air colder.<br/>
<br/>
It’s not until Reaper comes to a sudden halt in front of a massive floor-to-ceiling iron gate, that she realizes she has followed him into the dungeons of the castle.<br/>
<br/>
Completely out of breath, her muscles aching and her spleen contracting, she finally catches up with him and snatches him off the floor with one hand. As she turns him around to make him face her, he curls in on himself and turns into a ball right there on the palm of her hand; only his tail peeking out from the small crack in his armor.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t you ignore me!” she hisses. “What the hell was that?!”<br/>
<br/>
But of course, trying to talk to her familiar in this state would be like talking to… well, an actual ball.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m gonna take you bowling one of these days,” she huffs, curving her arm inward to cradle him against her stomach until he’ll feel brave enough to show himself again.<br/>
<br/>
Rio turns around to make her way back up the stairs, but something crackles in the air and tugs on her mind— her eyes drift back to the iron gate. Had it been any ordinary gate, Rio might’ve been able to saturate her curiosity by shrugging its existence off, pushing it to the back of her mind. But upon closer look, she notices multiple translucent purple tendrils of magic swirl around the iron bars. There is no lock, only a handle. Surely, if nobody is supposed to go through the gate, there would be a lock? Or even a sign?<br/>
<br/>
Curiosity wins the battle in her brain and she takes a few steps toward the gate. She can feel its magic: pulsing, dangerous, alive. It doesn’t seem like an ordinary cantrip; this isn’t the kind of magic she had learned in school, or even ever seen. It would probably be a bad idea to try and open the gate—<br/>
<br/>
The handle gives. As she pushes it open, Reaper chirps and shivers in her hand.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, yeah? Should’ve thought about that before running off, my friend,” she whispers down at him.<br/>
<br/>
With the gate now open, she realizes the magic isn’t connected to the bars, but to the entrance itself; like a thin veil of energy protecting whatever space lies behind the gate. Another probable warning as to why it would be a bad idea to walk through… But she’s come all this way, hasn’t she?<br/>
<br/>
Tentatively stretching out her fingertips, she pushes them past the veil. She expects something to happen – maybe a trap to be set off, or a sensation to be felt – but there is nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Encouraged by the lack of mortal danger she appears to be in, she presses on: her hand first, then her forearm, elbow, entire arm, shoulder, and eventually whole body.<br/>
<br/>
And even when she has stepped fully inside, she feels— nothing. Well, that must’ve looked stupid from an outside perspective: her trying to walk in slow-mo through an ordinary door.<br/>
<br/>
Rio chuckles at herself and checks in on Reaper, but he’s still being a naughty rubber ball.<br/>
<br/>
She looks around and realizes it’s too dark in here to navigate properly, so she summons an orb of silver energy to light her path. She’s standing in another hallway; the tiles dark, the corners covered in cobwebs. At the end of the hallway, another door is visible. Once Rio’s eyes have adjusted to the light, she notices a faint purple hue around that door too.<br/>
<br/>
As she approaches it, the empty dungeon hallway starts to feel more alive somehow. Warmer, more filled with energy. Additionally, she can’t ignore the strong magic pull emanating from the wooden door.<br/>
<br/>
Something big and powerful must be hidden in there.<br/>
<br/>
The closer to the door she gets, the more visible the purple energy becomes. It shines from under the door into the hallway, as if a purple candle is lit on the other side of the door. At this point, Rio is about 97% sure she actually isn’t supposed to be here.<br/>
<br/>
But how could she have known? Nothing has stopped her so far, or even suggested she’d stop and turn around.<br/>
<br/>
Now only two steps removed from the door, she can hear a few sounds coming from the other side of it; powerful pulsating magic, and the echoes of objects being moved— could there be a poltergeist in here?<br/>
<br/>
To her surprise, she also hears the soft murmurs of a voice. A female voice, low, dark, chanting, maybe a prayer, or even a spell.<br/>
<br/>
When Rio’s ear presses against the door, her heart rate in the triple digits, she can hear the voice more clearly: it isn’t chanting.<br/>
<br/>
It’s a song. It’s <em> singing. </em><br/>
<br/>
A singing ghost? She’s never heard of that before. Sure, some ghosts whistle tunes, or even hum along to pop music, but this sounds way more purposeful. So then what could it be? And why is it locked away so deeply in this part of the castle?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if she can make out the melody or the words, it would help her investigation. But the moment she strains her ears to listen, she realizes it’s quiet on the other side of the door.<br/>
<br/>
And now that she thinks about it; it has been for a while.<br/>
<br/>
The last thing she hears before her curiosity turns into blind panic are approaching footsteps, and the voice that had just been singing, calling out: “Who are you?!”<br/>
<br/>
<em> Agatha Harkness. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> She now recognizes the voice all too well. Of course it’s Agatha fucking Harkness. Of course Agatha fucking Harkness has her own <em> lair </em> in the darkest corner of the dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
But there’s no time to think about that now— she has to flee, before Agatha can see her.<br/>
<br/>
Rio takes off in the direction she came from, runs back toward the gate as fast as she can, but it’s too late. She can hear the wooden door creak open behind her, one second of stunned silence, and just before she turns the corner, a bellowed: <em> “Vidal?!” </em><br/>
<br/>
“Shit, shit, shit,” she murmurs, clutching Reaper to her chest as she bolts through the gate and closes it behind her. Through the iron bars and the purple veil she can faintly distinguish the dark and intimidating figure that is Agatha, wearing a long clock that reaches so low it looks like she is hovering rather than walking.<br/>
<br/>
And she approaches at a maddening pace.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Vidal!” </em> Agatha growls, her voice so hostile Rio wonders if she’d magically enhanced it. “<em>Not another step!” </em><br/>
<br/>
But that sounds like a bad, <em> bad </em> suggestion, so instead of turning into the meek prey Agatha probably expects her to, she runs away.<br/>
<br/>
Through the dark halls of the dungeon, on her way to— to where, exactly?<br/>
<br/>
If only Rio had paid attention when she had chased Reaper, she might’ve been able to find her way out now. But the scarce lighting and the similarity of all corners she turns, cause for more panic to rise. For the first time, she starts wondering how much trouble she would be in if Agatha would actually get to her. She decides pretty quickly that she doesn’t want to know.<br/>
<br/>
Though she maybe wouldn’t mind getting killed by one of the hottest <em> and </em> most wicked creatures she has ever met; but not today. Today, she is too young to go.<br/>
<br/>
<em> “Don’t run from me!” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> But Rio does, ignoring the fear of actually running <em> into </em>the headmistress instead of running away from her, being so lost in the maze now she can only hear Agatha’s strong voice somewhere around her. </p><p>Her salvation appears in the shape of a faint ray of late afternoon daylight shining down when she turns another random corner; light coming from above. Light coming from the <em> stairway. </em><br/>
<br/>
“Yes,” she breathes, wobbling her way up the steps, adrenaline having taken away a large portion of control over her muscles. When she reaches the top of the stairs and realizes she has ended up at a familiar intersection on the main floor, she takes off in the direction she knows will eventually get her to the teacher’s lounge.<br/>
<br/>
There is no way Agatha will follow her all the way up there, or confront her there even.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing she has to do is walk down this hall, up another set of stairs, cross the marble bridge— </p><p>“You.”<br/>
<br/>
An ice cold hand grabs her by the back of the neck, stops her in her tracks on the bridge, freezes her on the spot. </p><p>“Vidal.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s voice is lower in volume now, but much, much more dangerous. When she walks around Rio to face her, her venomous expression matches the tone of her words.<br/>
<br/>
With the headmistress standing right in front of her now, the hand in her neck hasn’t moved; Rio quickly realizes Agatha is using magic to keep her in place, to stop her from moving.<br/>
<br/>
“Dare to explain what you were looking for?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m— I’m sorry,” Rio gasps, not unlike their interaction by the trees this morning. The claw in her neck is making her shiver. Her eyes dart down to the tiny animal in her hand, and she continues: “I know it sounds unbelievable, but Reaper ran away again, I chased after him, and he—”<br/>
<br/>
“Spare me the sob story,” Agatha demands. As she looms over Rio, her eyes are almost ablaze. Rio swallows, and Agatha continues: “I’m not interested in why you were gallivanting through the dungeons. How did you get past the gate?”<br/>
<br/>
“How did I—” Rio huffs in surprise, but the hand in her neck tightens, and so she stiffens. “The door was open?” she tries with a careful shrug.<br/>
<br/>
“You think you’re so adorable,” Agatha sneers; demeaning, hateful. “Tell me. How did you get past the gate?”<br/>
<br/>
“But— but I’m serious! It was open— okay, maybe not <em> wide </em> open, but it isn’t locked or anything. Trust me, I expected it to blast me into next week too, but it didn’t, so I figured—”<br/>
<br/>
<em> “Dont. Lie to me!” </em>Agatha looks awfully close to losing her mind, and Rio prays there aren’t any students around to witness how Agatha can play her like a puppet, yelling at her like a dog. </p><p>“I’m not lying!” Rio breathes desperately, but she will consider it if Agatha keeps pushing her.<br/>
<br/>
“That gate is sealed with <em> blood magic,” </em> Agatha snarls, the last two words a whisper. “And as you very well know, that allows only a <em> very </em> selective group of people to walk through the enchantment. <em> Unless </em> an evil, powerful sorcerer breaks through it with a brute, dumb counter spell. And since I’d sooner transform into a gargoyle than believe that <em> you </em> would be capable of such magic, I command you to tell me from whom you stole that spell!”<br/>
<br/>
Rio just blinks at her, not unlike an owl. <em> Blood magic? </em> Blood magic is supposed to repel anyone who comes too close to the enchantment with a painful shock.<br/>
<br/>
But that hadn’t happened.<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha, I swear—”<br/>
<br/>
“If you don’t tell me within the next three seconds, this is going to turn into an extremely torturous ordeal for you.”<br/>
<br/>
“Please, I don’t know what to say! Maybe the enchantment faltered?”<br/>
<br/>
“Three—”<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha, I’m telling the truth! I don’t know any evil, powerful sorcerers—” Well, except maybe Wanda, but she hadn’t seen her in over ten years.<br/>
<br/>
“Two—”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m just a witch! I’m just a green witch who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time!”<br/>
<br/>
“One—”<br/>
<br/>
Just as Agatha lifts her hand to hex Rio into goddess knows what, Reaper stretches out in her frozen palm, finally having had enough of his defensive form. He does so with a loud, continuous shriek, making Rio’s eyes flick down in concern and Agatha’s hand drop in surprise.<br/>
<br/>
And he keeps shrieking; even when he’s expelled all his breath, he inhales to do it again, like a pocket sized fire alarm. Rio can feel him wiggle around in her hand, his nose aiming up at the wall somewhere behind Agatha, shuddering and shaking.<br/>
<br/>
While Agatha’s brows furrow in annoyance as she keeps looking at the upset animal, Rio’s eyes follow his gaze. Her eyeballs have just enough movement to trace his line of sight, and when she does— she gasps.<br/>
<br/>
Reaper isn’t looking at the wall. He is fixated on one of the large windows. More specifically: on what’s visible <em> behind </em> that window.<br/>
<br/>
She registers a claw first. A gigantic paw, dirty nails, lethally curved. The paw is attached to something way, <em> way </em> bigger: a bony structure, connected by a large piece of scaled, light brown colored skin.<br/>
<br/>
It’s a wing. A <em> dragon’s </em> wing, unmistakably so.<br/>
<br/>
The wing flaps once, twice— and even before Rio can process what has happened, the dragon has taken off into the evening night sky.<br/>
<br/>
When she brings her focus back to Agatha, she realizes she is hyperventilating when she tries to talk.<br/>
<br/>
“D— dra— dra— dragon,” she manages, pointedly looking from Agatha’s eyes to the window, even though nothing out of the ordinary is visible anymore.<br/>
<br/>
“What?” Agatha is caught so off guard by the apparently random word, she almost forgets to put on her mean voice.<br/>
<br/>
“Dragon!” Rio’s chest rises and falls rapidly. And even though it happened seconds ago, she’s already questioning whether she hadn’t made it up. “Outside, behind you, just now!”<br/>
<br/>
As Reaper is slowly calming down, Agatha’s expression transforms from agitated confusion into downright murderous.<br/>
<br/>
“Your distraction techniques lack creativity.”<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha I <em> swear—” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Are you trying to get fired on your first day, miss Vidal?”<br/>
<br/>
“What? No! Why would—”<br/>
<br/>
“Is that why you kept Mr. Maximoff from his private tutoring this afternoon?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s ears turn from pale to red like a traffic light.<br/>
<br/>
“Now that… that was my mistake,” she admits. “Though I didn’t know… Nobody had told me…”<br/>
<br/>
“Mr. Maximoff himself had been trying to tell you, is what I gathered from him?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, yes, but—”<br/>
<br/>
“And you assumed he was lying?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio scoffs nervously. “He’s a teenager! Can’t exactly blame me for—”<br/>
<br/>
“We exclusively educate fairness and honesty at this school, miss Vidal. You may trust our students’ integrity, unless otherwise specified.” A pause; Agatha looks her up and down. “Which is why I will inform the other professors to be careful around <em> you.” </em></p><p>At Agatha’s disdainful look, Rio exhales slowly. There is nothing she could say that would calm this woman down, or make her believe her.<br/>
<br/>
“This is your final warning,” the headmistress continues. “One more toe out of line, and I’ll send you right back to where you came from.” She chuckles dryly, keeps her stoic eye contact. “Or— I’ll have a <em> dragon </em> do it.”<br/>
<br/>
Her chuckle turns into full blown laughter: dirty, mean, humiliating.<br/>
<br/>
It isn’t until Agatha has disappeared from her peripherals, that Rio realizes she is still frozen in place.<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha!” she calls out. “Agatha? Can you— oh, for fuck’s sake.” </p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
An hour and fifteen minutes. That’s how long it takes for Rio to show up in the teacher’s lounge, finally having freed herself from Agatha’s paralyzing spell.<br/>
<br/>
If she had been a water witch, she might’ve been able to loosen the hold of the spell quicker by manipulating the liquid in her body. Had she been a fire witch, she could’ve countered the freezing hand with a blast of heat.<br/>
<br/>
But no, Rio, as a green witch, manipulator of the element earth, would’ve only been capable of getting herself even <em> more </em> stuck.<br/>
<br/>
And Agatha had known it.<br/>
<br/>
It had taken an enormous amount of effort to summon and collect small flames from candles all over the castle to slowly warm her up, not able to direct her magic via movement, only using her mind and voice.<br/>
<br/>
She had hexed the headmistress in her head the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, Rio!” Alice greets her as she storms into the teacher’s lounge. “We just had ice cream, do you want some?”<br/>
<br/>
“Absolutely not,” Rio grumbles, teeth chattering. She grabs the kettle off the stove and holds it under the tap, conjuring up some chamomile in her other hand. She adds it to the kettle and when it’s full, throws the kettle back onto the stove.<br/>
<br/>
“Rough first day, dear?” Lilia asks.<br/>
<br/>
“I had a blast,” Rio deadpans. She loses a battle with four, five, six matchsticks, before Alice pipes up.<br/>
<br/>
“Need some help with that?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio huffs in defeat, and Alice points at the kettle. Not even two seconds later, it starts whistling.<br/>
<br/>
“Thanks.”<br/>
<br/>
She’s about to pour the steaming hot tea into a mug, but Lilia motions for her to sit down while she serves the tea up.<br/>
<br/>
From the corner of her eye, Rio catches Jennifer mouthing ‘<em>Agatha?’ </em> at a very confused looking Alice. Alice shrugs.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, <em> Hagatha, </em> if you must know,” Rio reluctantly admits, accepting a mug from Lilia. “Walking in the acidic footsteps of <em> Evawhora. </em> ”<br/>
<br/>
None of the other three witches know what to say, and Rio can’t stand the silence, so she continues: “Where did she learn to be so mean anyway?”<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer chuckles humorlessly. “Right here, unfortunately.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio looks up in confusion: “What do you mean?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well— she went to school here, like everyone else.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s head turns toward the portrait of the headmistress. She doesn’t look older than 45. Not younger than 35.<br/>
<br/>
“When did she graduate?” she asks, not taking her eyes off of portrait-Agatha’s face.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t know… Twenty years ago?” Jennifer guesses. “Lilia, do you remember?”<br/>
<br/>
Lilia wraps one of her grey curls around a finger before she answers: “Yes. I believe it was twenty years ago.”<br/>
<br/>
Even though Rio had <em> just </em> warmed up, her blood runs cold. Lilia seems to be coming to the same conclusion at the exact same moment.<br/>
<br/>
“You— you must know her,” she says to Rio, an intrigued expression on her face. “You must’ve been here at the same time.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio stares back at her, then looks at Jen, then Alice. “It— it would seem so,” she mutters, before letting her eyes flick at her own portrait. “But I don’t think I’ve met her before.”<br/>
<br/>
“That’s… odd,” Jennifer remarks, unhelpfully.<br/>
<br/>
“Or maybe not,” Lilia says. “One of you might’ve graduated a year earlier or later. You might not have been in the same class.”<br/>
<br/>
But Jennifer does not let it go. “Yes, but… eight years. Orion Academy takes eight years. Rio, if you’ve been here at the same time for at least seven of those, shouldn't you be remembering her name? She’s Agatha <em> Harkness, </em> for crying out loud. The daughter of your headmistress at the time.”<br/>
<br/>
And Jennifer has a point, but Rio, as seems to be the theme for the day, doesn’t know what to answer.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t know. I’m going to take a shower,” Rio brushes it off, making it sound unimportant.<br/>
<br/>
But as unimportant as she wants it to be, the discrepancy doesn’t leave her brain. Not in the shower, not while trying to read a book, not while conjuring up some small flowers to liven up her sleeping quarters, and not when she tries to fall asleep for hours.<br/>
<br/>
Something weird is going on, and she has to know what.<br/>
<br/>
She rolls out of bed, throws on her robe and her slippers, and quietly makes her way through her portrait to the teacher’s lounge, which is completely dark by now. It’s past midnight, and she doesn’t want anyone to strike up awkward conversation, so she slips out into the castle with as little light as needed.<br/>
<br/>
Only the soft <em> tap-tap-tap </em> of her slippers on the marble floor is audible as she walks down to the main hall, where class photos of graduates adorn the wall. With the smallest orb of silver light brightening up a few feet in front of her, she searches for the photo of her graduation year.<br/>
<br/>
Not this one, not this one…<br/>
<br/>
There it is. <em> Class of 1994. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> And it’s been twenty years, so she needs a minute to locate herself as she doesn’t quite remember the day—<br/>
<br/>
But she’s nowhere to be found. Confused, she looks at the photos of 1993 and 1995 too, just to make sure she hasn’t remembered the wrong graduation year— but she’s not in those either.<br/>
<br/>
She looks back at the 1994 photo, and trails her finger past the list of names on the side, from the bottom up. <br/>
<br/>
“<em>Vidal… Vidal…” </em> she murmurs, but after a minute she can’t do anything but conclude: she isn’t on the list. <br/>
<br/>
Her finger traces up past the other names, curious to see if she remembers those. And she does;<br/>
<br/>
<em> Natasha Romanoff - Air </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> She keeps her finger on the name and lets her eyes flick back to the photo. Yes, that’s Natasha, in the front row; Rio remembers her well. Used her element to make her more evasive during combat. A smart, cunning witch.<br/>
<br/>
Going back to the list, she moves up a few names until she sees another one she recognizes.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Hela Odinsdottir - Earth </em><br/>
<br/>
Of course, Hela. In the back row, haughty expression, always in control. Rio remembers having a little crush on her; and being in the same class all the time as they shared a talent for green magic, didn’t help.<br/>
<br/>
Moving up a few more names—<br/>
<br/>
<em> Wanda Maximoff - Spirit  </em></p><p>There she is; Rio spots Wanda on the far left side of the second row. Looking at her face, smiling, so young and innocent, makes Rio feel weirdly melancholic. Who could’ve known this adorable, freshly graduated, highly talented witch would become one of the most feared wielders of chaos magic of her era?<br/>
<br/>
Rio moves up the list past a few more names, before her finger drops in shock.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Agatha Harkness - Spirit </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> She frantically cross references the picture, trying to spot Agatha, or what she assumes Agatha must’ve looked like twenty years ago—<br/>
<br/>
And there she is. Second row, far right side; her unmistakable long, wavy hair, her piercing eyes, her uncanny regality. Even her mysterious aura made it into the photo. She looks younger than she does now, obviously, but apart from lacking a few age lines by her nose and eyes, it doesn’t look like she’s aged much.<br/>
<br/>
So Agatha’s in the picture, but where the fuck is <em>she</em>?<br/>
<br/>
Going down the list once more to double check, her brain starts hurting when she can’t find her own name or her face. Was she sick on photo day? She doesn’t remember that either.<br/>
<br/>
Letting out a frustrated huff, her eyes drift to a young Agatha once more. Yeah, she definitely doesn’t remember her. If Agatha had been in her class, Rio wouldn’t even have <em> noticed </em> Hela. The aura Agatha radiates holds nothing to—<br/>
<br/>
Wait.<br/>
<br/>
Rio steps closer, investigating Agatha’s spot in the picture in hopes of finding more details. She almost chokes on her own breath when she realizes that Agatha’s <em> aura </em> isn’t an aura at all. It’s an unsymmetrical amount of space between her and the student to her left; more space than between any other students.<br/>
<br/>
Enough space for another student to fit in.<br/>
<br/>
<em> What the fuck. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Rio tears her eyes away from the picture as a pounding headache starts to develop behind her eyes. <em> What does this mean? </em> Why is she not in the picture? Or, if she has connected the dots right— why was she <em> removed </em> from the picture?<br/>
<br/>
She needs air. She needs to get away. She needs to ask someone, see the records, she needs more proof—<br/>
<br/>
Rubbing her temples in discomfort all the way back up to the teacher’s lounge, she jumps up when a figure is awaiting her arrival in the middle of the room.<br/>
<br/>
For a second, she’s scared it might be Agatha. But when she steps in and closes the door behind her, she realizes it’s Lilia.<br/>
<br/>
“Lilia!” she breathes. “Oh, it’s good to see you. I wanted to ask you something, and I know it’s a weird request, but I’ll owe you, okay? I was hoping you’d have access to any student records from twenty years ago? Like, I don’t know where they’re kept, and if I can find them, but I figured you—”<br/>
<br/>
Rio stops talking when she realizes Lilia is staring at her, but not listening.<br/>
<br/>
“Um— Lilia?”<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Oh no. Not now. As Lilia’s eyes turn silvery-white, Rio groans. She doesn’t know what to do when this happens. Does she sit her down? Does she stay with her until it passes?</p><p>Lilia doesn’t give her much time to think; her jaw drops open and she starts uttering words.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>A new moon, the night is prime.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Oh, okay. Those are the same ones as yesterday’s. And nothing bad happened then, right?<br/>
Carefully, Rio approaches the older woman, who keeps staring straight at her.<br/>
<br/>
“Okay Lilia, let it out. You’re doing great,” she encourages her awkwardly.<br/>
<br/>
<em> “A new moon, the night is prime. The first is born; an heir of time.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Shit, those are new words. Should she write them down?<br/>
<br/>
<em> “Nourished by the gift of speed, for he is brave, and born to lead.”  </em></p><p>Rio softly rubs up and down Lilia’s back while she subconsciously repeats the words in a soft murmur.<br/>
<br/>
“Hm. Sounds like someone I met this morning,” she chuckles. “Though I’m not sure he’d be a great leader.”<br/>
<br/>
“Who’d be a great leader, darling?”<br/>
<br/>
Lilia snaps out of it as soon as it had started.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, nobody,” Rio smiles. “It’s okay. How do you feel?”<br/>
<br/>
Lilia’s brows furrow in annoyance. “Don’t you have better things to do than to babble utter nonsense in the middle of the night?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s jaw drops, then she bites her lip to stifle another chuckle.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re right, Lilia,” she says earnestly. “I’m so sorry. Come on; let’s go back to bed.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>A restless couple hours of sleep, weird inexplicable dreams, and an alarm clock that rudely awakes her the moment right before she reaches out to touch light brown scales. </p><p>When Rio stands in front of a new group of non-green first year students the next morning, she decides to change things up from yesterday; she asks the students to introduce themselves and then check them off the list. </p><p>The moment she reaches the last kid, a boy all the way back in a corner of the classroom, she blinks a few times to get rid of the deja-vu, undoubtedly triggered by sleep deprivation. </p><p>“Tommy?” she says when she sees his familiar face. “What are you doing in my class again?” </p><p>A knowing chuckle rolls through the classroom, now brightened up by the blooming lilies of yesterday’s group of students. A few kids turn around to grin at the boy, who smirks and puts his feet up on his desk. </p><p>“I just missed you,” he says, followed by another round of laughter from his classmates. </p><p>“Eh, okay,” Rio says awkwardly. “Don’t you have another class to go to?” </p><p>“Are you dismissing me?” he asks, his grin widening. </p><p>But Rio trusts him about as far as she can throw him. Without magic, that is. </p><p>“What’s going on here?” she asks suspiciously. </p><p>From a different corner of the classroom, a nervous looking girl with big, round glasses on her freckled face pipes up. </p><p>“That’s not Tommy, Miss.”</p><p>All heads turn toward her, and a few annoyed sighs fill the room. </p><p>“He’s Billy. His brother,” she clarifies, and Rio’s attention flies back to the boy. </p><p>“You’re Tommy’s brother?”</p><p>“Fuck you, Cassie. Yes, I am,” he says, his eye roll emphasizing what he thinks of her. </p><p>“Hey,” Rio calls out, warning him by pointing a finger at him, “language.” After only a few hours of sleep, she definitely doesn’t have patience for this. She looks down at the list of student names and confirms there is indeed a Billy Maximoff in her class today. </p><p>“Tommy said you were cooler than that,” Billy grumbles, clearly trying to provoke her. </p><p>“Tommy didn’t say anything about having a twin,” she tries to fire back, still astonished at their likeness. </p><p>“We’re not twins,” Billy says with a shrug. </p><p>“In that case, one of your parents must have some really strong genes. I’m happy you two are in a different class, at least.” </p><p>“Don’t worry, we can fuck with you even if we’re not.” He crosses his arms in self-satisfaction.</p><p>“Language!” Rio says again. She turns her palm up and wordlessly levitates his chair up in the air, just like she did with his brother. Billy’s expression turns from smug into panicked in a heartbeat, frantically clutching the seat of his chair. He lifts his legs off his desk and whines dramatically when the chair sinks back down on the flood with a <em> thud.  </em></p><p><em> "D</em><em>on’t worry,” </em> she copies his own tone back at him, crossing her arms to mimic his earlier composure. “I’m perceptive. Soon enough, I’ll find out how your parents keep you apart.”  </p><p>“Good luck with that,” Billy counters, staring her down and pointedly putting his feet back up on his desk. “Oh, and I <em> really wish </em>you wouldn’t do that anymore.” He vaguely gestures from her, to his legs, to his chair. Then he crosses his arms, again. </p><p>Cassie, and a few other girls, gasp. Rio lifts an unimpressed eyebrow and flicks her hand out at him to lift his chair in the air once more. </p><p>But nothing happens.</p><p>What? </p><p>“<em>Levitare facio,” </em> she hisses the enchantment, agitated at the fact that she even <em> needs </em>the words for such a simple spell. Still— nothing happens. </p><p>“What did you do?” Rio shakes out her hand as if the batteries are dead. The moment she puts two and two together, her shoulders drop in defeat. “Don’t tell me you’re a spirit with too.” </p><p>Rio has always been weary around spirit witches. As the wielders of the most powerful element, they’re the most unreliable too. A particularly well-trained spirit sorcerer could gain complete control over anyone’s mind— and use it however they see fit. A dangerous talent. </p><p>And certainly not a talent a student should be wielding against a teacher. </p><p>Before Billy can open his mouth to confirm, she warns him: “Maximoff. If you don’t get out of my mind right this second, the headmistress will hear about this.” </p><p>A feeble argument— the headmistress would laugh her straight in the face if she told her she’d been bested by a student, not even five minutes into her first class with him. But Billy doesn’t need to know that.</p><p>“Oh no,” he deadpans, waving his hands in fake desperation. “Please do. You should know, though: I’m not even <em> in </em>your mind.” </p><p>Rio stares at him, waiting for an explanation. Which he doesn’t provide, of course. </p><p>“Billy can <em>want</em> things into existence,” Cassie whispers loudly, and another annoyed collective groan rolls through the classroom. <em> Damn, Cassie, </em> Rio thinks<em>. </em> A teacher’s pet is definitely nice for a teacher to have, but she sure as hell wouldn’t have been friends with her if she’d been her classmate. </p><p>But if what she says about Billy is true—</p><p>“Do you happen to be tutored privately as well, Billy?” </p><p>“Yeah.” </p><p>—oh no. Another sprit witch with a unique talent <em> and </em> access to chaos magic. Agatha might be wicked, but she’d better get a hold on these children, fast. </p><p>“And are there any rules about you using your magic in class?” </p><p>“No,” Billy says, but is immediately followed up by Cassie: “Headmistress Agatha said: no magic other than what is required for class.” </p><p><em> “Cassie!” </em>A couple of other kids groan; and to be fair, Rio would’ve probably joined them, had she been twenty-five years younger. Just like Billy’s classmates, Rio would’ve probably found it highly entertaining if someone with that kind of power used it to mess with the teacher all the time. Now however, Cassie might be her favorite student. </p><p>“What?” Cassie says innocently, and a little bit haughtily, “it could be dangerous. She said it herself.” Rio can’t help but wonder what Agatha thinks of this particular girl. </p><p>“Thank you, Cassie,” Rio says, hopping up to sit on her own desk in front of the class. “Well, Billy, seems like you’re balancing on the boundary of a one-way ticket to the headmistress’ office. And I’m sure neither of us wants to know what happens when you get there.” </p><p>Instead of another smart comeback, Billy’s gaze turns stark. “I’m sorry, miss Vidal,” he says dutifully, throwing up his hands in defeat. “No more magic.” </p><p>Rio watches him with a baffled expression as he even lifts his feet off his desk. Well, shit. This kid must’ve been sent to see Agatha for something he did in class more than once. </p><p>She decides to put a pin in that thought, but doesn’t miss his sudden change in demeanor.</p><p>“Alright, who’s ready to grow some lilies?” </p><p>The class answers her in an approving mutter, and she instructs the students to retrieve their materials from their bag. </p><p>“Oh, and Billy?” she lowers her voice.</p><p>The boy looks up at her, a questioning look on his face. </p><p>Rio twirls her fore and middle finger together, causing two vines to sprout up at Billy’s feet. She closes her fist and the vines wrap around his ankles and the legs of his chair; nothing too tight, just another warning. He gasps, and she immediately disintegrates the vines with a snap of her finger.</p><p>“You might be a spirit witch, but I used to be a teenager too. I’ve seen the headmistress’ office probably more than you, in my time. So I <em> think </em>I have a couple years on you when it comes to pulling smart little tricks.” </p><p>She cheerily winks at him, and pretends not to notice his smirk as she turns around to retrieve her own bag. </p><p>No student of hers will get moody in her class without being cheered up by the end of it. </p><p>“Step one,” she says, raising her voice back up to address the whole class. “Preparation! No flower can grow without the right kind of soil.”  </p><p>Aiming both of her hands at her own desk, she conjures up a pile of moist, dark brown soil. “Can anyone identify what kind this is?” </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>To Rio’s relief, the rest of the class is fairly uneventful. She does notice a slight difference in skill level; this group of students seem to pick up on the material a little faster than yesterday’s class. </p><p>Ten minutes before the end, Rio walks up to Billy’s desk, where a somewhat sulking lily is sticking out from his pot. </p><p>He doesn’t look up when she approaches, so she taps her fingernail on the wood. “How’s it going here?” </p><p>Billy shrugs. “It’s hard.” </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio chuckles. “I can imagine, if you’re used to getting everything you want with a snap of your fingers.” </p><p>“Not everything,” he says, looking up at her now. </p><p>“Maybe not now,” Rio says empathetically, summoning an empty chair from behind her to sit down next to him. “But once you learn to control it, I’m sure you will accomplish great things.” </p><p>Good <em> or </em>bad, if his aunt is any example. But she doesn’t say that out loud. </p><p>Billy gives her an empty chuckle. “The problem isn’t that I can’t control my magic,” he says. “The problem is that everyone else can, too.” </p><p>Rio furrows her brows as she wonders what he could mean. </p><p>The conviction that this boy has some interesting stories to tell slowly dawns on her. </p><p>“Do you need to leave class early?” she asks him, looking at her watch.</p><p>“Huh? No.” </p><p>“Your private tutoring isn’t happening every day?”</p><p>“God, no,” he huffs. “Just once a week.” </p><p>“Gotcha.” Rio nods in understanding. “So Mondays only?” </p><p>“No, Mondays are for Tommy. Thursdays are my days.” </p><p>Oh.</p><p>“So you don’t go to see the headmistress together?” Rio says, surprised. </p><p>Billy treats her to an eye roll. “What do you think <em> private </em>tutoring means, miss Vidal?” </p><p>And while he shouldn’t talk to his teacher like that, she knows he has a point. Smartass. </p><p>Rio can’t help but imagine what happens during those private classes. What does controlling chaos look like? What would <em> Agatha </em> be like as a teacher? And more importantly— does <em> she </em>possess chaos magic as well? And if not; how can she teach it?</p><p>Her thoughts flash to Wanda. Rio briefly wonders if things had gone down differently, had Wanda been privately tutored in her time. </p><p>If only they had known back then. </p><p>Rio often asks herself is she’d missed the signs; if there had been something she could’ve done to prevent it all. She wishes she could’ve helped Wanda, and the people around her. To dismantle the ticking time bomb she’d turned out to be. </p><p>“Miss Vidal?” </p><p>Billy’s voice pulls her from her thoughts; he looks at her with an expression in his eyes that makes him look at least ten years older than he is. </p><p>“Hmm?” </p><p>“Why did you f— mess up your uniform?” Billy asks, a tad less judgmental than his brother. </p><p>Rio looks down at herself, at the colorful flowers stitched to her blazer; the straight, golden line along the hem is replaced by a string of vines, while the breast pocket is adorned with a bunch of azaleas in full bloom. </p><p>She smirks at him. “You think I <em> messed it up? </em>” she says, pretending to be offended. “I’d rather call it—“ </p><p>Something tugs on her spine with such force, the air is knocked out of her lungs. She gasps for breath as the world around her starts spinning, energy funneling her entire being as if she’s being sucked backwards. It knocks her over; she falls, and falls, and falls back, but the forceful landing she expects never happens. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em> “You think I messed it up?” Rio says, nervously plucking at the folds in her skirt, her bottom lip curling down in a pout. Colorful petals are scattered all around the waistband, though the stitching looks a bit sloppy. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The girl in front of her starts laughing; a bright, contagious sound. Her long red hair, tied up in a ponytail, swings over her shoulder as she throws her head back.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Do I think it looks awesome? Yes. Do I think you messed it up? Also yes! The headmistress is gonna strangle you!”  </em>
</p><p><em> “Evanora can suck my dick,” Rio grumbles. “She never—” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em>Sizzle. Crack. Sizzle.</p><p><em> “—so I might as well.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> “Are you sure that’s why you did it?” Wanda asks, her voice dropping in conspiracy. She plops down in the grass and lets herself fall onto her back, arms wide. “You’re not fooling anyone.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> A shiver runs down Rio’s spine; someone’s watching her. Someone other than Wanda. She spins around on the back of her heel and sees— no one. But her senses never let her down; she knows. Someone is listening in. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Turning back to Wanda, she presses a finger to her own lips, points at her ear with her other hand, then points behind her. Wanda nods in understanding. She looks over to the other side of the courtyard— </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Sizzle. Crack. Sizzle.<br/>
<br/>
<em> “—not just to me, but to the entire school! I should have expelled you a long time ago, but goddess knows where you might end up. If only it weren’t my responsibility…” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Evanora trails off and her gaze is so sharp she might sear a hole through her soul. Her long, grey robe covers nearly her entire body, except for her face and her hands. Hands which are raised, ready to initiate offense. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> “Miss Harkness!” Wanda scrambles up from her spot in the grass and doesn’t hesitate— she steps in front of Rio, shielding her from the headmistress. “Don’t you think you might be overreacting?” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> “Maximoff.” Evanora scrunches her nose in disgust. “You have some nerve. Step aside, child. This is between me and—” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em>Sizzle. Crack. Sizzle. </p><p><em> Her teeth chatter. Rio wraps her arms around herself in humiliation, which is worse than the cold. She can hear the faint laughter of some boys from seventh year. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> “Here, honey,” Wanda says, shrugging off her own blazer and wrapping it around Rio’s shoulders. “I promise you: one day I will destroy that woman.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> “Not if I get there first,” Rio mutters, tugging the blazer down to cover as much of her bare ass as possible. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> “The largest identifiable piece they’ll find of her will be an eyelash,” Wanda jokes, trying to lighten the mood. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> “Let me know if they do— I’ll come to set it on fire.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
<br/>
</em></p><p><br/>
With the feeling of coming to a sudden halt, like a car slamming the breaks, Rio gets jolted back into the classroom, staring into Billy’s worried eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“You’d rather call it…?” he asks, and she realizes she must’ve been lagging for a few seconds.<br/>
<br/>
“I’d rather call it… um, fashion,” she chuckles breathily, raking her shaking hands through her hair.<br/>
<br/>
The memory had slammed into her like a wrecking ball; as if she’d watched it for the first time, as if she hadn’t thought about it from the day it happened. When she’d altered her uniform the other day, she hadn’t even <em> realized </em> she’d done it before<em>—</em> when she was still a student. Something with old dogs and new tricks.<br/>
<br/>
“You alright?” Billy asks suspiciously, to which Rio quickly looks at her watch.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah!” she says, a tad too enthusiastic. “Alright everyone, that’s class for today! Great work. I’m seeing some beautiful flowers.”<br/>
<br/>
She gets up from her chair and, like yesterday, instructs the students to pick a spot for their lilies. She then busies herself by rearranging the items in her bag for absolutely no good reason, while her students slowly make their way out of the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
Once the last one has left, she lets out a shuddering breath.<br/>
<br/>
So she <em> was </em> in the same class as Wanda. And though she remembers not being a model student, and being sent to see Evanora all the time, she’d forgotten about being humiliated like that.<br/>
<br/>
The bitchwitch is truly better off dead.<br/>
<br/>
And Wanda, apparently, had shared that sentiment, even when they were only… How long ago must the memory have happened? Wanda looked 16, maybe 17? </p><p>Rio hoists her bag up over her shoulder and walks past the rows of lilies her students had grown over the past couple of days. Though her favorite classes are the energetic ones <em>—</em> the classes with the green students <em>—</em> she can’t help but be proud of her non-green students. The incantations and the treatment of the soil can be difficult for someone who can’t wield earth magic; it requires a lot of patience. </p><p>She wonders if these teenagers will have the same amount of patience throughout the rest of the year… And she highly doubts it. </p><p>Rio is so deep in thought that she doesn’t hear the muffled, restrained shouting until she’s already near the exit of her classroom. </p><p>“…know the consequences! You have no idea what I do to ensure your and everyone else’s safety.” </p><p>Through a crack in the door she can see Billy, his back pressed up against the wall. His earlier cockiness, and later gloominess, has now made way for a look of utter agony. </p><p>“I know— I know, I’m sorry. I don’t know why I did it. Sometimes it just… happens.” </p><p>Shifting her weight a little, Rio can now make out the tall figure looming over him— and of course, who else would intimidate her students like this if not Agatha. Rio can only see her back, but she doesn’t need to see her face to know how angry she is.</p><p>“‘<em>It happens?’ </em> It happens, Billy? You can’t afford for things to just <em> happen! </em>You need to practice control.” Her words are an angry snarl, making the boy in front of her seem even smaller.</p><p>“<em>I know!” </em>Billy says again, his voice rising almost an octave. “I said I’m sorry! I have these… impulses. I know I shouldn’t, but it’s like my body does something before my mind can catch up.” </p><p>“I’m not interested in your excuses,” Agatha snaps. As she leans in, Billy looks to the floor in an attempt to avert her gaze. His eyes follow an invisible thread up past Agatha, where he suddenly locks eyes with Rio. </p><p>As soon as he realizes Rio is listening, he gasps almost inaudibly and flicks his eyes back to the headmistress'. </p><p>“You know what happens if I have to interfere,” Agatha threatens as she grabs his chin in her hand, her voice lower now. Billy nods quickly, his head awkwardly wobbling in Agatha’s grasp. “And neither of us wants that to happen, do we?” The boy shakes his head. </p><p>“I’m sorry… headmistress.” </p><p>“That’s right,” Agatha says, and she releases his chin. She condescendingly taps his cheek twice— then she freezes, her hand still on Billy’s face.</p><p>“You can come out now, Vidal.” </p><p>Rio jumps at hearing her own name, stumbling back into her classroom to hide, but she realizes it doesn’t matter. But Agatha’s back is still toward her, how does she—</p><p>“I would suggest you find a different hobby, as <em> lurking </em>is only going to get you some new enemies in this castle.” </p><p>“I don’t <em> lurk,” </em>Rio protests, swinging the door open. Yet, she feels like a teenager all over again, caught doing something she isn’t supposed to. “You’re having a conversation. In front of my classroom. Loudly, might I add.” </p><p>Agatha drops her hand and turns around. Slowly. </p><p>“And anyone possessing just a droplet of common sense would either excuse themselves, or keep walking.” </p><p>Rio huffs. This is unfair. Her gaze lands on Billy; he watches them with bated breath.</p><p>“Last time I checked, the hallway is a public space,” Rio says coyly. Again, the headmistress is awakening a new kind of rage in her chest. Like her sole purpose on this planet is to piss her off— as often and as badly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, and eavesdropping isn’t illegal,” Agatha pouts innocently, her voice like honey. Then she takes a step toward Rio and drops her expression. “But it’s definitely proof of character.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio glowers and, for once, doesn’t know what to say. Not because she doesn’t have a comeback— she has hundreds. No, it’s because reasoning doesn’t work on Agatha.<br/>
<br/>
The headmistress looks back at Billy. “Scram,” she says, before turning toward Rio and raising an eyebrow. “You too.”<br/>
<br/>
And Rio wants to say something, to make a face or a sound, to lash out, to strangle her and to be the bigger person at the same time, but before she can decide on something, Agatha strides past her— but not before shoulder checking her so hard it elicits a groan from Rio.</p><p>Evanora has never been a compassionate individual, but Rio wonders if the day she’ll<em> miss </em> her might be near. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p><br/>
The evening is going better for Rio. She decides to spend some time among the other teachers, which turns into a pleasant conversation about how her first couple of days have been.<br/>
<br/>
They’re in a corner of the lounge; Lilia, Alice, Jennifer, and Rio herself. A large persian rug separates the area from the rest of the space, and a few mismatched armchairs are placed in a circle. Rio has dropped herself onto a lilac bean bag, Lilia and Jennifer are in arm chairs across from each other, and Alice sits cross legged on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
It feels almost homey.<br/>
<br/>
“How was I supposed to know there are two of them?!” Rio whines into her hands, causing the other witches to laugh.<br/>
<br/>
“The Maximoff brothers are kind of notorious,” Alice provides, peeling a banana with a grin. “We assumed you <em> knew </em> the demon has a duplicate.”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s only the second semester of their first year!” Rio says incredulously. “I don’t recall being <em> that </em> much of a trouble seeker when I was new to Orion.”<br/>
<br/>
Lilia sniffs loudly, raises her eyebrows and pointedly scratches her own cheek with a fingernail.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s jaw drops in protest. “I wasn’t!”<br/>
<br/>
Lilia purses her lips, but still doesn’t say anything.<br/>
<br/>
“Was I?”<br/>
<br/>
“You dear, on your first day, wiped your entire class <em> and </em> your teacher out by pouring half a vial of Komodo dragon stomach acid into a beaker of chlorine. <em> You </em> are the reason the first year potions class isn’t taught until the second semester. The first semester now focuses on biohazards and safety.” </p><p>Alice and Jennifer both slap a hand in front of their mouths, making wide eyes at each other, snickering behind their palms.<br/>
<br/>
Rio sighs. “Okay, well I meant <em> after </em> that.” Lilia fondly shakes her head. “At that age, I wanted to be a water witch so badly,” Rio adds in a mumble. She remembers trying to convince her classmates and even her teachers of the fact that she <em> was </em> a water witch. It wasn’t until her own botany teacher at the time had pointed out that Rio sprouted flowers from her palms when she lied.<br/>
<br/>
And while that hadn’t been true, it had proven an effective way of keeping young Rio in check, as she would hide her hands behind her back every time she lied.<br/>
<br/>
“A water witch?” Jennifer pipes up. She puts her elbow on the armrest closest to Rio, and props her head up with her fist against her temple. “What made you want to be a water witch?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio looks over at a smirking Jennifer, and her eyes dart over to the water witch’s portrait. The subtle blue swirls around Jennifer’s silhouette are almost hypnotic.<br/>
<br/>
“I hated earth,” she starts explaining. “I mean— I hated the idea of having so much control over all living things. The responsibility of keeping plants or animals alive, also means death if you screw up. I knew early on; I think I was eight or nine. I was taking care of a ladybug when I accidentally transferred its life force into a wasp on the other side of the window. I cried so hard I threw up.” </p><p>When Rio looks up, Jennifer’s face has grown softer. “I can imagine. That sounds like a horrible experience,” she says empathetically.<br/>
<br/>
“But not all green witches have control over <em> life force</em>,” Alice remarks softly, quiet admiration hidden in her words. “And those who do, can only use that power on plants. Yours works on animals?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio shrugs. "Unfortunately. But I’m so clumsy—”<br/>
<br/>
“—oh, we know dear—”<br/>
<br/>
“—so I rejected the responsibility for the longest time. I wanted to be a water witch, because the concept of <em> flowing </em> with life instead of deciding what is worthy and what isn’t, was much more appealing. That, and I loved making a mess as a kid. I was so excited about my first potions class.”<br/>
<br/>
“Remind us to never let you in Jen’s classroom, or her bedroom for that matter,” Alice chuckles in an attempt at humor.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, you can make a mess in my bedroom. I don’t mind,” Jennifer responds in a low, ambiguous voice. Rio swears she catches the end of a wink, and quickly looks in another direction with tinted cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
“Too bad we didn’t go to the same school!” Alice continues talking to Rio, oblivious to her charged interaction with Jennifer. “Jen and I grew up on the other side of the country. Believe me when I say that she and I were the only fun people there. Sounds like high school would’ve been much more memorable if we had been your classmates.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio chuckles shyly at the, what she assumes is a compliment, and awkwardly plucks the seam of the bean bag. Memorable. Apparently her own time at Orion hadn’t been as <em>memorable</em> as she’d always thought, seeing as the facts don’t line up with her memories. </p><p>“It wasn’t too bad,” Jennifer says. “But Alice and I definitely pulled each other through. Well— and Bug and Toni, of course.” </p><p>“Bug and Toni?”<br/>
<br/>
A knowing smile is exchanged between the two witches. “Do you want to meet our familiars?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio shoots up in her bean bag. “Oh! Yes, I’d love to! I’ll introduce them to Reaper, too!”<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer outstretches her left arm and swirls circles around it with her right— a few seconds later, an animal materializes, folded over her outstretched arm. At first Rio thinks it might be a snake, but then the animal grows fur and paws. It looks like a ferret now, but it grows bigger and bigger, until finally it’s too heavy for her to hold up, and she flips the animal around in her arms, carrying him like a baby.<br/>
<br/>
“This is Bug,” she says lovingly, smiling at the sea otter in her arms. Bug rubs his furry paws over his cheeks and then slams his palms together as if he’s clapping. He is the cutest thing, and the women around him collectively start making cooing noises at how adorable he is.<br/>
<br/>
“I have a tub for him upstairs. He prefers being in the water,” Jennifer explains.<br/>
<br/>
“Makes sense,” Rio nods, and softly strokes one of Bug’s paws with her finger after asking Jennifer permission with a look. “Jesus Jennifer, Bug is adorable. I might steal him in your sleep.”<br/>
<br/>
“Or you can just ask to hang out,” she replies, and Rio bites her lip to pretend she doesn’t hear the double entendre in that statement.<br/>
<br/>
“What about Toni?” Rio asks over her shoulder, her finger now confiscated by the otter. </p><p>Alice outstretches both of her palms and takes a breath. “You might wanna stand back,” she warns, before rubbing her palms together and closing her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Rio furrows her brows in anticipation; what animal could Toni be? A bear? An ostrich? A lion? Familiars don’t usually tend to be larger than hip height, but who knows what kind of animal Alice found in herself. </p><p><em> “Amicum animalem evoco.” </em> <em><br/>
</em><br/>
In front of Alice, in the center of the persian rug, a small ball of fire appears. The ball zips in different directions before it starts to shape itself; and the tiniest mammal Rio has ever seen lands on the rug with a soft <em> poof. </em><br/>
<br/>
“Is that… a <em> shrew?” </em> Rio giggles at the familiar, about as large as her pinky finger, its nose up in the air, frantically sniffing up all the new smells in the room.<br/>
<br/>
“Size doesn’t matter!” Alice exclaims pedantically, but not mean. “This is Toni.”<br/>
<br/>
“What’s Toni short for?” Rio asks, enamored by the miniature mouse running along the rug in circles. <br/>
<br/>
“Her little legs,” Jennifer answers quickly, cracking herself up so violently that Bug jumps from her arms and bolts through the room.<br/>
<br/>
“Ha-ha,” Alice sighs, but Rio catches the curve of her mouth. “Toni as in Serotonin.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio blinks. “That’s genius.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you, Rio,” Alice grins, proudly looking over at Jennifer.<br/>
<br/>
When Rio looks down at Toni, she watches as Bug slowly approaches the shrew. Toni squeaks excitedly as soon as she sees Bug, who rolls onto his back to have Toni jump up on his chest.<br/>
<br/>
“They’re <em> friends</em>?” Rio’s jaw drops as she watches the gut wrenchingly adorable scene in front of her. Her teeth start itching from cute aggression.<br/>
<br/>
“Best friends,” Alice confirms. “Bug has to carry her when they go out on an adventure, but they both know it’s Toni who is really in charge.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s heart aches, and it reminds her to summon her own best buddy.<br/>
<br/>
<em> “Amicum animalem evoco,” </em>she softly murmurs, and has her armadillo appear a few feet from where Bug lies on the floor. </p><p>“Reaper; this is Bug and that’s Toni,” she says dutifully. “Bug and Toni; meet Reaper.”<br/>
<br/>
The shrew barely realizes another animal has appeared beside her, but Bug turns his head and flops over in excitement, accidentally flinging Toni off his belly.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey!” Alice calls out, leaning forward with her hand outstretched to have Toni skitter back to her. Jennifer cackles loudly.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh<em>—</em> Reaper!” Lilia says, taking in the animals in front of her with a tight smile. “I remember the day you got him.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio watches as Reaper immediately rolls up into a ball as soon as Bug starts sniffing at him. She chuckles; “Yeah, so do—”<br/>
<br/>
Wait. Does she? Does she remember the day she met Reaper?<br/>
<br/>
The memory is watery, filled with static noise. She loves to tell people that she remembers it like it was yesterday, but now that she actually tries to recall the details— she comes up with nothing. It frightens her; like a part of her brain, her memories, her identity is brutally chopped off with an axe.<br/>
<br/>
“—so do I,” she continues, the humor in her voice gone. She’ll ask Lilia what <em> she </em> remembers, sometime when they’re alone.<br/>
<br/>
“Well— you all know Castor,” Lilia says after clearing her throat, sitting up a little straighter in her chair. She spreads her arms and her raven shoots from her necklace in a ray of light, appearing as large and intimidating as ever.<br/>
<br/>
“Hi Castor.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hello buddy.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hey pal!”<br/>
<br/>
“But I believe you’ve yet to meet Pollux.”<br/>
<br/>
Again, Lilia spreads her arms, and for the second time a beam of white light shoots from her necklace. Next to Castor appears another raven, as large and as deeply black as he is.<br/>
<br/>
“You have <em> two?!” </em> Alice exclaims in surprise, voicing what Rio and probably Jennifer are thinking too. Rio’s eyes drift to Lilia’s necklace where two silver raven pendants usually dangle from the chain; but they’re gone now.<br/>
<br/>
“They’re twins,” Lilia nods proudly as her ravens perch down on her armrests, one on each side. “Castor and Pollux appeared like this from the first day I summoned them. It confused everybody at the time, of course— including me, for a good amount of years. It took me a while to realize Castor stays with me in the present, while Pollux likes to travel with me when I’m divining. Past or future.” </p><p>Rio whistles in awe. “That’s insane. Like, insanely cool.”<br/>
<br/>
As Alice turns to Lilia to ask her something about the ravens, Rio feels a warm hand on her arm.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you mind if I pet Reaper?” Jennifer asks softly. Rio shakes her head. “No, of course, go ahead. If he wants to.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio leans forward to scoop her little ball off the floor and hold him up in her palm. “He gets like this when he’s nervous or scared. But there’s a little trick…”<br/>
<br/>
With the utmost care, she starts lightly tickling Reaper’s tail with a finger. He wiggles and squirms at first, but when Rio doesn’t back down, he uncurls himself to scream at her.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey buddy,” she chuckles. “Don’t be like that. There’s someone who wants to meet you.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio looks up at Jennifer who is still in the arm chair, but before she can pass Reaper on, the other woman gets up to let herself drop onto the bean bag, right next to Rio. Well, that works too.<br/>
<br/>
“Hello little man,” Jennifer coos, holding out her finger for Reaper to smell. Rio can feel her body heat when she leans in to make contact with the familiar still in Rio’s hands.<br/>
<br/>
Reaper sniffs once, twice, and then his little tongue darts out to give Jennifer’s finger a tentative lick.<br/>
<br/>
“Look at that,” Jennifer says in a dark whisper. “He wants to taste me already.”<br/>
<br/>
For the third time that evening Rio feels a blush creep up on her cheeks, and she can’t help but giggle. She leans back into Jennifer a little as her eyes drift over to the otter. “Do you think Bug—”<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Omnia magica finio.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> An angry voice bellows through the room, right before all five animals dissipate right back into their owners; Bug’s energy wraps itself around Jen’s arm, Toni turns into a fireball and zips into Alice’s palm, Lilia’s necklace regains two silver raven pendants, and Reaper retracts back into Rio’s chest. It all happens within a second, leaving all four witches speechless.<br/>
<br/>
“No. Familiars. In common spaces,” Agatha growls, standing by the kitchen with her arms crossed. “You <em> know </em>that.” </p><p>“Agatha, my god—” Jen immediately protests, pushing herself up from where she sits, not scared to call out the headmistress. “None of us have stuck to that rule for <em> months! </em> We were just hanging out, we weren’t doing anything wrong!”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, you were,” Agatha replies coolly. “Because, again; no familiars in common spaces.”<br/>
<br/>
As Jennifer takes a step forward, the other three witches collectively tense up. Rio can’t help but be glad that she, for once, is not Agatha’s main target.<br/>
<br/>
“You're not seriously trying to convince me that you think that rule makes sense?” Jennifer says offendedly, spreading her arms wide. “Ending someone else’s conjuring is rude! Why do that in the first place? Why now?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m going to repeat myself one more time, <em> Jenny Kale,” </em> Agatha says condescendingly while taking another step forward. She pinches her index finger and thumb together to emphasize every syllable as if conducting a choir. “No. Fa-mi-li-ars. In. Com-mon. Spa-ces. You speak English, correct?”<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha,” Lilia breathes softly, but Agatha shuts her up with a look.<br/>
<br/>
“I. Hear. You,” Jennifer says, mockingly copying Agatha’s exact movements. “I’m. Say-ing. You’re. Not. Ma-king. Sense.” <br/>
<br/>
As Agatha’s chest starts to puff up in rage, Rio can’t hide how impressed she is at Jennifer’s ability, and mostly courage, to talk back. Is it courage? Maybe it’s a death wish.<br/>
<br/>
But because the headmistress seems to be temporarily knocked off balance by Jennifer’s audacity, her eyes dart across the room to Rio— both a distraction and an easier target.  </p><p>“Don’t stray off the path to impress the <em> new girl,” </em> Agatha says calmly. Rio realizes she’s still talking to Jennifer, but Agatha’s eyes are locked onto her own. “She’s not worth it.”<br/>
<br/>
Her words feel like a punch in the jaw, but in slow motion. How and why does Agatha dislike her so much? <em> What has she done? </em><br/>
<br/>
Before she can find her voice, Jennifer holds up her hand and speaks in her place. “What has Rio done to you, Agatha?”<br/>
<br/>
Great question.<br/>
<br/>
Though Rio can’t help but wonder what makes Jennifer so unafraid to talk to Agatha like this. If <em> she’d </em> go off against her, the headmistress would rip her to shreds on the spot. Probably spit on the pile of mush, too.<br/>
<br/>
“What could she have done in not even 48 hours to piss you off so badly? The poor woman has barely unpacked her suitcase and from what I hear, you’ve been harassing her relentlessly.” </p><p>Okay, true, but— Rio’s shoulders slump the tiniest bit. She feels like a bullied school kid whose mother has sought out her bully to give them a stern talking to.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha catches on as well, and pouts in fake worry.<br/>
<br/>
“Aw, has the new girl already come crying to you?” She shakes her head and tuts. “Such a tattletale, Miss Vidal.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio exhales and balls her fists so forcefully, her energy drives a crack in the tile underneath her feet. The moment she realizes, she quickly nudges the rug over it with her foot. But it’s too late; Agatha narrows her eyes and nearly implodes.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>And now you go and vandalize my school? </em> We had an agreement, Miss Vidal. I warned you; one more toe out of line, and—”<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha!” Jennifer barks, snapping her fingers in front of the headmistress’ face. “Stop pissing her the fuck off then!”<br/>
<br/>
That clearly crosses one of Agatha’s boundaries, as she finally looks back at Jennifer and grabs her wrist with her own hand shaped like the claw of an eagle. “And <em> you </em> can pack your things as well if you keep talking to your superior like that. In fact— that sounds like an <em> excellent </em>idea. How about the both of you disappear from my sight forever and live a happy, happy life together, somewhere on the other side of the planet?” </p><p>“My <em>superior? </em>For fuck’s sake, Agatha,” Jennifer says calmly, not affected at all by the headmistress’ sharp nails digging into her wrist. “If for whatever reason you hate Rio so much, then why bring her onto the team at all? Why hire her in the first place?”<br/>
<br/>
The tiniest crack appears in Agatha’s armor; it’s a flash in her eyes, just for a fraction of a second, and it has disappeared before Rio is even able to register it.<br/>
<br/>
“Orion was in urgent need of a <em> green witch,” </em> Agatha says with so much disgust dripping from her voice at those last two words, it might as well have been a slur. “And I happened to trust Lilia’s advice.” She looks over at the older witch who’s still sitting in the armchair, nervously fiddling with the hem of one of her many cardigans.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha violently releases Jennifer’s wrist before rolling her eyes and adding: “Well— lesson learned, I guess.”<br/>
<br/>
Something inside of Rio snaps. Agatha can chew on her and spit her out all she wants, but she will <em> not </em> get away with dragging Lilia through the mud like that.<br/>
<br/>
The impulse to stand up is executed by her body before it even reaches her brain stem. Her feet are rooted into the floor, her fingers tingle with the supportive energy of the bricks, plants, and earth around her. She feels solid, confident; like no hurricane will be able to knock her off her feet.<br/>
<br/>
The headmistress has already turned her body toward her own portrait, when Rio shouts: “Hey! Agatha!”<br/>
<br/>
Because something doesn’t add up. Something <em> isn’t </em> right. She doesn’t deserve to be treated like this. She hasn’t done anything to evoke this unyielding wrath from Agatha.<br/>
<br/>
Or has she?<br/>
<br/>
Her memories have been playing tricks on her, at least these past couple days. What if Agatha, in some twisted way, does remember her? What if she <em> has </em> done something to piss her off, and she just doesn’t remember it?<br/>
<br/>
Agatha stops dead in her tracks and turns her head slightly; not facing Rio all the way, but enough to show that she is listening.<br/>
<br/>
Rio swallows. A beat passes. And then, her voice breaking:<br/>
<br/>
“Do you remember why you hate me?”<br/>
<br/>
She can vaguely feel Alice, Lilia, and even Jen holding their breath; but her entire focus is on Agatha. The powerful spirit witch in front of her who seems frozen in time while processing Rio’s words.<br/>
<br/>
Someone less perceptive than Rio would’ve missed the slow blinks. The tightening of her jaw. The small puff of air she exhales. The confused spasm of her brows.<br/>
<br/>
But no one misses the way she furiously strides toward her portrait and disappears without a word. </p>

<p>
<em> Rio will recognize their laughter anywhere.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Not just recognize it, but actively seek it out, chase it, make sure it hurts her good.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> And if she happens to be in the courtyard at the same time as the girls she is eavesdropping on, that is merely a coincidence. Her astrology class got cancelled, so where else to spend the afternoon than laying down in a patch of green grass, behind a conveniently dense jasmine bush? </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You think I messed it up?” she hears Agatha wonder out loud. Rio can’t see her, but she can hear the nervous tone in her voice. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Wanda laughs in response. “Do I think it looks awesome? Yes. Do I think you messed it up? Also yes! The headmistress is gonna strangle you!”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Evanora can suck my dick,” Agatha grumbles. “She never, ever tells me when I do something right. Everything I do is wrong in her eyes, so I might as well.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Are you sure that’s why you did it?” Rio hears Wanda teasingly ask, her voice suddenly softer. A pause, and then—  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You’re not fooling anyone.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio’s curiosity is piqued, and she pushes herself up on her elbows to be able to peek through a small gap in the bush. But just as she has found the perfect angle to spy on the two girls, she watches Agatha place a shushing finger to her lips and point in Rio’s direction.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Fuck.   </em>
</p><p><em> She quickly plops down again and squints at the audible </em> poof <em> when she lands back in the grass. She prays Agatha hasn’t seen or heard her, but the girls stay suspiciously quiet. </em></p><p>
<em> Rio suddenly realizes why when she hears a faint rustling on the other side of the bush, as if someone is looking for something. She presses her lips together and holds her breath, heartbeat pounding in her ears— </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Agatha!”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The unmistakable voice of the headmistress thunders through the courtyard. The rustling stops abruptly.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What in the hells do you think you’re doing?”  </em>
</p><p><em> Oh, she must’ve done something bad. </em> Bad <em> bad. Evanora is in a mood all the time, and Agatha is always on the receiving end of her verbal whip, but the headmistress sounds particularly angry today.  </em></p><p>
<em> “How dare you! How dare you?! If you want to throw away your future, child, be my guest. But I will not accept you vandalizing the Academy’s uniform.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Mother, please— it’s just an alteration. It’s not like I walk around naked—”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio doesn’t often catch Agatha sounding so small and vulnerable. It gives her the shivers.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You are an embarrassment, Agatha. Not just to me, but to the entire school! I should have expelled you a long time ago, but goddess knows where you might end up. If only you weren’t my responsibility…”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> A silence follows, and Rio carefully peeks through the bush again, holding her breath to not get caught. Now that she has a clearer view, she can see what Evanora is so wound up about: Agatha has enchanted her uniform to display colorful petals around the waistband.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio frowns; it’s definitely an upgrade from the sad, bland uniform. It’s quirky and fun; why does it piss Evanora off that badly?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Miss Harkness!” Wanda scrambles up from the floor and comes into view. She takes a heroic breath and positions herself between Agatha and the headmistress.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Don’t you think you might be overreacting?”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Exactly, Wanda, Rio thinks. She’s glad someone steps up for Agatha, so she doesn't have to.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The headmistress’ gaze slowly drops to the red haired girl in front of her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Maximoff.” Evanora scrunches her nose in disgust. “You have some nerve. Step aside, child. This is between me and my daughter.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Evanora roughly grabs her by the upper arm and shoves her aside.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Mother!” Agatha whimpers, but she looks too stunned to move.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You’re right, Agatha,” Evanora says, taking a threatening step in her daughter’s direction. “It’s not like you walk around naked— but you ought to. Anything is better than having you undermine my authority like this.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> One careless, swift movement of her hand later, all of Agatha’s clothes vanish into thin air. Rio gasps loudly, and immediately smacks her hand against her mouth.  </em>
</p><p><em> As Evanora strides off, Agatha looks absolutely mortified. Rio is about to step in, wants to help her, wants to do </em> something, <em> but doesn’t want to scare Agatha in this vulnerable situation— </em></p><p>
<em> “Here, honey,” Wanda says, shrugging off her own blazer and wrapping it around Agatha’s shoulders. Oh, good. That’s good. “I promise you: one day I will destroy that woman.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> You or I, Wanda.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Not if I get there first,” Agatha mutters.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “The largest identifiable piece they’ll find of her will be an—”<br/><br/></em>
</p><p>Sizzle. Crack. Sizzle. <br/><br/></p><p>
<em> “Don’t.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> …what?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Rio. Don’t.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio blinks, suddenly not in the courtyard anymore. Her new surroundings don’t just look unfamiliar, but unidentifiable too. It feels like an empty space— but an empty space with a view of a dark orange sunset.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She slowly turns around and takes a surprised step back when she stands eye to eye with older version of the Wanda she just witnessed in her memory. This Wanda wears her red hair loose, wild, and she must be around Rio’s age. The sunset somehow seems to emit from… her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em>“…Wands?”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The nickname leaves her mouth before her brain has caught up.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Rio, you need to stop. Don’t pry around in those memories.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “W—what? What do you mean? How are you here? Are you causing them? Is this a dream?”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Please.” The light around her dims as some kind of pleading sadness drapes itself over the chaos witch. “Will you please trust me?”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Trust you?” The tiniest crease appears between Rio’s brows. “What does that even mean? I have no idea what’s going on. I think someone wiped my memories, Wanda, and I barely even remember you, I know you’re— you’re dangerous…”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Wanda’s expression falters for a moment, then turns into something hard. Determined. “Yes. I have done some terrible things. And if you want to stay protected, Rio, you should stay away from me. Now, and in your memories.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I don’t want protection, I want the truth!” Rio exclaims, harsher than she wants to. “I have no idea what’s going on, and it’s driving me insane! Something is up with you, with Agatha—” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Don’t,” Wanda repeats, more intense this time. A passionate fire kindles behind her eyes.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> ”How can I trust you if you don’t tell me the truth?” Rio asks, feeling herself tremble and slip away, getting a little desperate about it.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She watches Wanda contemplate something before visibly giving in.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We were close, once. You and I,” she admits, looking Rio up and down, a faint sheen of melancholy on her face. Rio’s jaw tenses as she tries to make sense of those words, tries to recall their bond— </em>
</p><p>
<em> “And what about Agatha?”  </em>
</p><p><em> “Rio,” Wanda warns her, taking Rio’s right hand in her own. “It is in the name of our</em> <em>friendship that I ask you to trust me. And if you don’t: then please trust yourself.”  </em></p><p>
<em> Before she can respond, Rio feels another tug at the base of her spine and gets sucked back— back all the way to a room in the castle she can’t immediately place yet. But Wanda is there, and so is Agatha: younger than they are now, older than in their school memories.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio doesn’t know how much lucid time she has in this memory, so she frantically looks around for something she recognizes, something she can use to make sense of anything.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> That’s when she realizes: Wanda’s cheeks are puffy and wet, and Agatha, beautiful, intimidating, evil Agatha, is pressing down into her own eyes with the pads of her thumb and index finger.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio wants to reach out, but her heaving chest prevents her from doing so.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Please,” she hears herself say, the word broken and her voice soft. “Can you make me forget? Wanda— please—” </em>
</p><p><em> A heartbreaking sob escapes Agatha’s lips: </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “No— I want more time!” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> It takes all of Rio’s willpower not to look at her.  </em></p><p>
<em> Instead, her eyes land on a piece of paper, but the words seem murky, letters dancing:  </em>
</p><p>
<img alt="prophecy" src="https://i.postimg.cc/MKfb0wzP/prophecy-ch5.png" width="100%"/>
</p><p> </p><p><em> </em> A new moon—</p><p>  —an heir of time</p><p> </p><p>  Nourished by—</p><p>  —and born to lead</p><p> </p><p>  The second boy—</p><p>   —his own desire</p><p> </p><p>  —his downfall comes when</p><p>  will not give him—</p><p>  —always in the Dark</p><p>
<br/>
<em>Tearing her eyes away from the paper, she watches as a large tear trickles down Wanda's face.<br/><br/>Rio feels her own devastation, but even moreso her determination when she says:</em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’m begging you, Wanda. I need to… I need to forget. All of it.” </em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/><br/><br/>Rio jolts awake, throwing the covers off as cold sweat makes them stick to her legs and back. Her chest is still heaving and when she touches her face with the back of her hand, she feels the remnants of tears on her cheeks. </p><p>“Fuck, <em> fuck,” </em> she mutters, swinging her legs off the bed and pushing herself up on her fists. What the hell was that?<br/><br/>Eyes still unfocused, she brings one of her fists to her chest, rakes a hand through her hair. Then, the dream she just had jumpstarts her brain, snapping back into it like an elastic band.<br/><br/>Agatha’s outfit, Wanda’s attempt at defending her, Evanora hexing her daughter… So it’s <em> Agatha’s </em> memory? Has it been all this time?<br/><br/>Then Wanda’s dream intervention; her warning, the concern on her face, her pleading for Rio to trust her and not pry…<br/><br/><em> Was that real? </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> The more she tries to picture it, the more heartbreaking Agatha’s sob sounds in her mind.<br/><br/>“<em>No— I want more time!” </em><br/><br/>Time for what? And why would Rio beg Wanda to take her memories?<br/><br/>Blinking profusely against the image in her mind, Rio casts her gaze outside and frowns at the amount of daylight streaming in through her windows. It must be—<br/><br/><em> Shit. </em><br/><br/>Upon a look at her watch, Rio realizes she’s slept through her alarm. She jumps into action, quickly washing her face and throwing on her uniform. Without consuming her breakfast she races down, through her portrait and through the teacher’s room, speed walking to her own classroom.<br/><br/>She gets there seven minutes after the start of her class, out of breath and ignoring the disappointed groan from the students who had hoped her class would get cancelled.<br/><br/>“Books away,” she shouts as she marches in, swinging the door shut with a wave of her hand. She lets herself drop onto her chair, whips her feet up on her desk and claps her hands to get the students’ attention.<br/><br/>Rio isn't sure whether to call it memory, to call it intuition, or to call it pettiness when she says:<br/><br/>“Take two minutes to think about what your favorite flower is— we will be stitching it onto your uniforms today.” </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Over lunch, Rio decides to give Reaper some airtime again. She perches herself up against the purple blossom tree after checking whether the burrow in the trunk is uninhabited this time, and summons her trusted armadillo. </p><p>“The man, the myth, the legend,” she smirks when he materializes, cheekily making finger guns at him. Reaper excitedly wiggles himself up her torso and into her arms for cuddles, but Rio realizes quickly she’s fallen for his scheme when he starts snapping at the cheese chunks in her caesar salad.<br/><br/>“No, no, I don’t think so,” Rio berates him, lifting her lunch container up and out of his reach. He makes a disappointed sound and hops down, sniffing the grass and making his way toward the burrow.<br/><br/>She watches him familiarize himself with the trunk when she hears a loud noise coming from a group of excited young voices across the courtyard.<br/><br/>Lilia, followed by a bunch of giddy first years, makes her way from the castle to an open spot in the field. She lines the students up and stands in front of them to give an instruction, but they’re too far away for Rio to catch what Lilia is saying. </p><p>It doesn’t take long for her to realize why Lilia has taken her students outside when Rio watches her puff out her chest and Castor appears, circling the group in two impressive flaps of his wings before landing on Lilia’s shoulder.<br/><br/>The students bounce up and down in excitement, while Rio herself sits up straighter to watch them: this must be their first familiar summoning.<br/><br/>Lilia silences the group to say something, talking animatedly with her hands and pointing at her raven every now and then. When she motions for her class to get to action by waving both of her hands in their direction, she turns around and locks eyes with Rio across the distance.<br/><br/>Rio smiles and waves shyly; Lilia stares at her for a few seconds before beckoning her to come over. Excited to watch her former teacher, now colleague teach a class, she scrambles up, salad in hand, and walks in Lilia’s direction. Reaper follows suit, keeping close to her ankles as he waddles along.<br/><br/>“Miss Vidal happens to be graced by the presence of her familiar,” Lilia announces as soon as Rio is within hearing distance. “She is an example of a witch who has an extraordinary bond with hers. Reaper, if I’m not mistaken?”<br/><br/>“Yes,” Rio nods proudly, looking down at her tiny friend. Reaper stops running when he hears his name; his ears perk up, earning him a collective “<em>awww!” </em> from the group of first years.<br/><br/>“Don’t let him know you find him adorable. His ego has a tendency to grow four times his size,” Rio jokes as she finally approaches Lilia. Almost as if on cue, Reaper confidently pads to a spot in front of the two teachers, and curls up into a ball with a flourish.<br/><br/>“Alright mister man, this is <em>not</em> the big Reaper show,” Rio snickers as she steps in to scoop him off the grass. Reaper chirps in protest. </p><p>“Okay, back to you,” Lilia tells her students, but not without an endeared smile in Reaper’s direction. “Like I said— the first step is to choose a name for your familiar. Since your familiar is a part of your soul, it should be a name you connect with. Even without knowing what kind of animal it will manifest as.” </p><p>“Miss?” A young boy’s voice pipes up. When Rio looks up to see who it comes from, she realizes that this is Billy’s class. Or Tommy’s? No, she’s pretty sure she recognizes Billy’s posture—</p><p>“Yes, Billy?” Lilia provides, and Rio grins at herself.<br/><br/>“Miss Vidal?” Billy clarifies, a pointed look at Lilia and his hand up in the air. “What made you choose Reaper as a name?”<br/><br/>The corner of Rio’s lip curves up at the memory, and she opens her mouth to answer his question— </p><p>Wait, what memory?<br/><br/>How <em> did </em> she come up with Reaper? Does she, in fact, even remember that day?<br/><br/>Her breath hitches as she realizes the image in her mind is gone. She <em> swears </em>the memory had been fresh in her mind earlier, but when she tries to connect to it, it’s as if she’s catching smoke with her bare hands. </p><p>“I, um— Reaper— he, well, the first time we—”<br/><br/>Lilia saves her from her nightmare by placing a calming hand on her upper arm. “A very considerate question, Billy, but we don’t want you to be influenced by other people’s stories. The name should be your choice, from your mind only. I’m sure Miss Vidal will tell you all about her experience later.”<br/><br/>Billy murmurs something unintelligible, while Lilia watches Rio from the corner of her eye as she silently mouths <em> ‘thank you’.  </em></p><p>The group splits into smaller groups of four to discuss names, and Rio takes the opportunity to ask Lilia about what <em> she </em>remembers of the first time she summoned her familiar. </p><p>“Oh, I remember you were <em> not </em> happy,” Lilia smiles fondly, reaching out to pet the little ball in Rio’s hands. Then, her smile transforms into a distant look, as if she’s looking right <em> through </em> him.<br/><br/>When her eyes snap back to Rio’s, she looks more lucid.<br/><br/>“I think you expected something… ‘<em>cooler’</em> than him,” Lilia says, making air quotes. “I don’t imagine you would’ve chosen Reaper as his name if you knew what he would turn out to be. Which is why it suits him so beautifully.” </p><p>Rio frowns at her armadillo as he slowly uncurls himself, yawns unabashedly and, upon a look at Castor on Lilia’s shoulder, clambers up Rio’s arm to copy the raven and perch on Rio’s shoulder. His little paws quiver at his effort to stay balanced, making both women laugh.<br/><br/>Rio can’t imagine ever not being happy with him.<br/><br/>Her breathing slows, trying once more to summon the memory of her first meeting with him, the moment she came up with his name, the first time she laid eyes on him…<br/><br/><em>         “Rio, don’t.” </em><em><br/></em><em><br/></em>Wanda’s voice echoes clear through her mind, so loudly it makes her jump.<br/><br/>“I’m sure the memory will come back to you one day,” Lilia muses, drowning Wanda out. But before Rio can ask what she means, Lilia has turned back to the group.<br/><br/>“If you’ve named your future familiar, line up on my left. If you need more time, stay right where you are— take all the time you need.”<br/><br/>A few students shuffle around to do as Lilia says and line up in the grass. Among them is Billy, a mischievous glint in his eyes.<br/><br/>Rio takes a respectful step back as Lilia continues her instruction to the first years who are ready to perform the spell.<br/><br/>“Wonderful. Let’s give it a first shot, one by one. When it’s your turn I’d like you to present yourself, stand up straight, and find your familiar— wherever it may be. The incantation is as follows: <em>Amicum animalem evoco.” </em><em><br/></em><em><br/></em>Some students repeat the spell in a shy mumble, familiarizing themselves with the words. When it’s the first girl’s turn, Lilia praises her bravery, and she readies herself for the arrival of her familiar— but nothing happens.<br/><br/>The second student, a boy way too tall for his age, only manages a faint red glow in the tips of his fingers.<br/><br/>The third student has no success whatsoever; the fourth startles himself when he accidentally starts mooing like a cow, making the rest of the group giggle.<br/><br/>Then it’s Billy’s turn. He looks down at his hands, plants his feet firmly on the ground, straightens his spine. Closes his eyes, breathes once, twice, makes brief eye contact with Rio.<br/><br/>“Did you get it on your first try?” he challenges her, buying himself some time.<br/><br/>Rio scoffs. “Yes. Obviously.” In truth, she has no idea.<br/><br/>Billy’s grin returns and he confidently speaks the words.<br/><br/>“<em>Amicum animalem evoco.” </em><em><br/></em><em><br/></em>A purple glow brightens up his chest, making him gasp in surprise, almost throwing him off balance.<br/><br/>“<em>Don’t lose your focus!” </em>Rio calls out at him, only realizing how invested she is when the words have already left her mouth. It earns her a raised eyebrow from Lilia, which she ignores. </p><p>The light in the boy’s chest sinks down, to his stomach, his hips, his upper legs, his knees, but never fades. He starts shaking on his feet, lets out a strained groan, and his purple drops down into the earth— only to emerge back up and materialize as a small black-and-white animal with a fluffy tail.<br/><br/>“Oh, oh, oh shit!” Billy exclaims, shaking like a leaf, staring at his young familiar as if he had birthed it himself.<br/><br/>Rio can’t help but step in and curiously look down at the patch of grass, where a tiny baby skunk is fast asleep at Billy’s feet.<br/><br/>“This is incredible,” Lilia praises him softly. Then she raises her voice. “He did it. Billy actually did it, and on his first try nonetheless!”<br/><br/>As the students’ murmur dies down, Billy squats down to carefully scoop the skunk up into his hands. He looks positively enamored.<br/><br/>“What’s this little one’s name, Billy?” Lilia gestures for him to turn around and present his familiar to the class.<br/><br/>Billy blinks, at loss for words, still captivated by the sleeping baby in his hands.<br/><br/>“Billy?”<br/><br/>“This is…” Billy swallows, looks up at Lilia, then at the group, and starts chuckling uncontrollably.<br/><br/>“Everyone… This is Beast.”<br/><br/>And if Rio chokes on a piece of lettuce, no one can hear it through the collective laughter. </p><p>

<p>It takes a couple of weeks for Rio to get used to her new rhythm. Get up, breakfast, avoid Agatha, teach, lunch, teach, avoid Agatha, socialize (while trying to avoid Agatha), and go to bed. </p><p>She almost, <em> almost </em>forgets about the strange things that have been happening since her arrival, but that all changes when September turns into October, and her first class on Monday is incomplete due to the absence of Tommy. Now that in itself isn’t enough to throw her off balance, but the fact that Billy is absent during his class on Thursday too makes Rio squint at the empty desk in suspicion. </p><p>“Anyone know where Mr. Maximoff could be?” </p><p>“He wasn’t feeling well, Miss Vidal,” Cassie pipes up. Rio tilts her head at her.</p><p>“He’s sick? That’s odd— so was Tommy on Monday.” </p><p>“They both must’ve caught something.” </p><p>Which is a logical explanation, but not very likely. Despite being brothers, Billy and Tommy sleep in separate dormitories. </p><p>Rio decides to file that thought away for later, until one week later Tommy is back at his desk on Monday morning, albeit looking a bit on the paler side. </p><p>“Feeling all better, Tommy?” </p><p>“I am!” He beams up at her, but his lack of playful banter seems strange.</p><p>“No more underage drinking on a Sunday night,” she warns him in all seriousness. </p><p>Her students giggle. </p><p>“Ri— Miss Vidal, I am eleven.” </p><p>“I’m just saying. If I catch you with a Smirnoff Ice I’m telling your parents.” </p><p>“What’s a Smirnoff… Ice?” </p><p>Rio exhales and realizes her mistake. </p><p>“Cherish these blissful ignorant years, boy. Before you know it you’re about to take your morning shower, there’s a bottle ready and waiting for you on the drain and your classmates stand around you chanting <em> ice, ice—”  </em></p><p>She presses her lips together and inhales sharply through her nose when she sees twenty-ish pairs of eyes staring at her in utter confusion. </p><p>“Moving on!”</p><p>She keeps an eye on him during the rest of the class, while she shows her firstyears how to determine the growing direction of an unruly pothos plant. </p><p>But when 11:50 rolls around and she sees Tommy turn into a blur, making a beeline for the door, she taps her foot to make a vine sprout from the tile floor and wrap around one of the straps of his backpack, effectively making him stumble backward. She dismisses the other students as she keeps a solid grip on him. </p><p>“What the fuck?! Miss Vidal?!” </p><p>“Language,” she says sternly, while motioning for the other students to keep walking. </p><p>“I’ll think about my <em> language </em>if you stop harassing me!” </p><p>“I’m hardly harassing you, I just want to know how you’re doing. For real this time.” </p><p>When the last student has left the classroom, she swings it shut with a flick of her wrist.</p><p>“I said I’m great! Is this about my pothos? Miss, I swear it was an accident when it wrapped around Cassie’s ankle—”</p><p>“It’s not about your schoolwork, Tommy.” Rio shakes her head with a lopsided smile, realizing she has to convince Tommy of her non-hostility. “I was just worried because you weren’t in class last week.” </p><p>“I was sick,” Tommy provides, kicking invisible dirt around. </p><p>“Hmm.” </p><p>“What? I <em> was!” </em>He insists, his jaw dropping in offense. “Fucking ask Billy to look into my mind and show you, if you don’t believe me.” </p><p>“…ask Billy to…?” </p><p>“<em>Fuck!”  </em></p><p>“Tommy, language!” </p><p>Tommy stares at her with a betrayed look in his eyes, as if accusing her of having him walk straight into her trap. Rio could easily let it go, had Tommy not been giving off the vibe that he’s hiding something.</p><p>“Billy was sick too,” she decides to say, her voice neutral. </p><p>“Yep. Can I go?” </p><p>“You’re not a hostage, of course you can go,” Rio shrugs. “I just think it’s interesting. Does that happen often, both of you getting sick? Is that some twin telepathy thing?” </p><p>“We’re not twins,” Tommy replies, offhand. “You getting up in your students’ business, does that happen often?” </p><p>“Ouch,” Rio says out loud, not about to get one-upped by an eleven year old. But she knows she’s onto something. “I’ve seen Billy spend a lot of time with his familiar. How’s that going for you?” </p><p>“Okay, good for him,” Tommy says, unimpressed. “But we are not the same person, you know that, right?” </p><p>“I know,” Rio sighs, slowly feeling herself become defiant too. “I was just curious. Billy summoning Beast on his first try is… almost unheard of, and—”</p><p>“It’s not hard for someone who can make all his own wishes come true to be at the top of his class, is it?” Tommy spits, and for the first time she realizes the silent but tangible vendetta between the two brothers.   </p><p>“And I’m sure he’s your favorite too. You’re all <em> he </em>can talk about anyway.” </p><p>Rio raises her brows in surprise. “What do you—”</p><p>“<em>Miss Vidal just gets me,” </em> Tommy quotes his brother in a mocking voice. “<em>I wish she could tell me more about Aunt Wanda, bla bla bla..."  </em></p><p>Rio scoffs, feeling slightly knocked off guard by the revelation. But she pushes the proud feeling away— there’s another brother to win over. A brother she <em> thought </em>she had in the pocket already. </p><p>“Well, Tommy, I didn’t mean to compare you two, or upset you. Everyone deserves their own pace. There are students who don’t summon their familiar for the first time until year five—”</p><p>She trails off when Tommy’s irises start glowing a faint shade of purple. </p><p>“<em>Amicum Animalem Evoco,” </em>he growls out of pure spite, and before Rio can blink twice, she feels something small but persistent tug on her slacks. When she looks down she’s met with the sight of a baby wallaby, clenching the fabric of her pants in its tiny fists. </p><p>Rio’s heart drops to her stomach. </p><p>“C’mon, Trouble,” Tommy says with a nod of his head. “We’re outta here. Let’s tell the headmistress why we’re late to her private lesson—<em> again.</em>” </p><p>Oh shit. </p><p>“Tommy, I’m sorry—” But Tommy turns into nothing but a blur as he speeds out of the room. Rio sighs, and then lets her eyes drop to the slightly dazed wallaby who clearly can’t keep up with him yet. </p><p>Despite that, the animal seems to know where she’s going, skipping in the general direction Tommy just disappeared in. </p><p>Well… it would be irresponsible to let a baby animal roam around by herself, wouldn’t it? Rio should escort Trouble back to her owner, even if that means she might catch a glimpse of what happens in those private lessons…<br/><br/>“Well, hop along,” she tells the animal who looks up at her as if to say <em> ‘are you sure’? </em> But Rio nods encouragingly and Trouble awkwardly skips out of the room and down the hall.<br/><br/>And for a baby animal of her size, she’s surprisingly speedy. Which tracks— she is <em> Tommy’s, </em> after all. Rio has to trot after her to keep up, all the way to—<br/><br/>The dungeons. Of course.<br/><br/>Rio supposes she shouldn’t be surprised when Trouble leads her down the same path Reaper had taken her a few weeks earlier; down into the dungeons, through the maze of hallways and sparsely flickering candles on the wall.<br/><br/>She lets Trouble speed ahead as she herself slows down, careful not to run straight into a blazingly furious headmistress, who will no doubt filet her like a piece of salmon when she sees Rio down here.<br/><br/>It turns out to be a smart choice when Trouble vanishes from her line of sight, but two arguing voices carry their way back to Rio’s ears. She knows she shouldn’t, but curiosity takes over; she presses herself against the wall and carefully inches closer toward the sound, peeking around the corner to see Tommy having run into Agatha. </p><p>Eavesdropping on the headmistress for the second time might not be Rio’s smartest move; but it’s like watching an accident happen she can’t look away from.</p><p>“I don’t want to,” Tommy whines across the hallway, slowly sliding his back down the stone wall until he sits on his haunches. As he looks up at Agatha, his face scrunches up in annoyance, making him look like the figurehead of male puberty. </p><p>Trouble, who has now caught up with Tommy, looks up at him-– her eyes nervously darting toward Agatha and back as the wallaby crosses her paws in front of her. </p><p>Tommy notices his familiar’s nervousness and reaches out to pet her— but before his hand makes contact with her fur, his familiar vanishes in a cloud of purple smoke, and an invisible force pulls Tommy himself roughly up by the scruff of his neck. </p><p>“Mom! What the fuck!” Tommy yelps as he lands back on his feet. </p><p>Rio gasps and her hand flies to her mouth to cover the sound, but her elbow slams into one of the candle holders with a loud <em> cling.  </em></p><p>Rio’s vision starts to blur, has to blink against the dizziness. </p><p>Her impulse to correct Tommy’s language again gets overpowered by a single thought: </p><p>
<em> Oh, fuck.  </em>
</p><p>The sudden silence in the conversation between Agatha and Tommy tells her enough— they must have heard something. In fact, Agatha might already be on her way to inspect the source of the noise. </p><p>No, not <em> again— </em> following familiars is gonna be the fucking death of her.<br/><br/>Rio pushes off against the wall and bolts, as seems to be tradition by now. Blinded by panic she starts running down the dark maze, trusting her instincts to guide her back to the stairs leading up to the castle.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Rio’s instincts are capable of setting herself on fire and flinging her off a cliff— not one single corner she turns looks familiar. Quite the opposite, actually; she’s pretty sure she’s never been in this part of the dungeons before, not even when she tried to escape Agatha last time.<br/><br/>She turns one more corner, and her heart jumps at the sight of a more powerful light source down the hall; this might be her way out. Her stamina has run out and her spleen is about to rip in half, so she speedwalks toward the light while she presses her own hand into her waist to alleviate the pain.<br/><br/>The light source does in fact turn out to be daylight coming down from a flight of stairs— but not a flight of stairs she has seen before. Not a flight of stairs leading to the castle.<br/><br/>Rio stops dead in her tracks and listens— and when she can still hear steady footsteps approaching, she knows she has no choice. She launches herself up the stairs, two steps at a time, and soon she realizes the stone steps turn into a moldy, muddy cave.<br/><br/>Her pulse thunders in her ears. As a student, Rio had spent hours and hours trying to find one of the secret passages underneath the castle; passages that had only been whispered about but never proven. She’d never had any success, up until now: this must be one of those hidden tunnels.<br/><br/>“Shit, shit, shit,” she murmurs as the daylight coming in through the roots at the ceiling of the cave turns scarcer and scarcer. As she keeps walking, she trails her fingers along the wall of the cave to calm her down; as an earth witch, she’ll feel connected to her surroundings as long as she keeps her connection to the earth open.<br/><br/>She sends out a pulse of magic with her palm, using it as some kind of radar to guide her to the exit of the cave, wherever that may lead. </p><p>Her magic returns from straight up ahead, so that’s where her salvation might be.<br/><br/>The path beneath her feet starts inclining and she follows it up, up, up— until she reaches a small hole above her head, covered by a large plank of oak— no, cherry wood.<br/><br/>She pushes it to the side with a flick of her wrist and starts climbing up and out, covering herself and her clothes in dirt in the process.<br/><br/>When she emerges, Rio has to blink against the amount of daylight hitting her eyes— she stands at the edge of a large lake, surrounded by grey mountains with snowy tops across from her. The lake shimmers in a beautiful, clear blue color and Rio recognizes it; this is Sapphire Lake, about a mile or three from the castle. This location isn’t unfamiliar to her, as she used to come here a lot as a student when she needed to clear her head or just be alone for a while. </p><p>But she’d never known this route existed.<br/><br/>Rio covers the hole back up with the piece of cherry wood, just to be sure, and follows a somewhat beaten path beneath her feet, leading her through the pine trees at the edge of the forest surrounding the lake.<br/><br/>She walks until her path is blocked by a large boulder, a clear marker to the start of the steep mountains. She cranes her neck to figure out where to go from here when a shadow passes by her. She whips around to see what or who it is, when—<br/><br/>“<em>Billy?!” </em> she calls out, now standing face to face with one of the brothers.<br/><br/>“Not Billy,” the boy in front of her sighs, making the heat rise to Rio’s cheeks.<br/><br/>“Oh, sorry— Tommy,” she corrects herself, but then she notices his robes; different from the ones Tommy had just been wearing. “No, wait, you’re not Tommy,” she deducts, and the boy’s expression turns into a sly smirk.<br/><br/>“You’re right. It’s Billy,” he admits, and Rio almost cheers in relief. “It’s okay. Even our mom still fucks it up, sometimes.”<br/><br/>And again, Rio’s need to correct his language gets overshadowed by a more pressing thought.<br/><br/>“Agatha. I mean— the headmistress. The headmistress is your mom,” she stammers, only now processing the shocking revelation.<br/><br/>Billy’s eyes grow as big as saucers. “What— how did—”<br/><br/>“Not important,” Rio interrupts him. “What are you doing here? How did you even get here?”<br/><br/>“Eh…” Billy shrugs, taking in his surroundings. “Same way as you, I suppose.”<br/><br/>“The tunnel?” she calls out in surprise. “You know it exists?”<br/><br/>“The… yeah, duh,” Billy replies, rolling his eyes in a perfect bratty reflection of his brother’s behavior earlier. It somehow brings out Rio’s defiant side, especially since this half-pint has discovered a secret she has never found <em> in his first fucking year. </em> <em><br/></em><br/>“Didn’t think you could keep this passageway a secret from your <em> earth </em> professor now, did you Billy?” she taunts him, lightly prodding her finger into his shoulder. “What do you even come out here for? Don’t tell me you smoke?!”<br/><br/>Billy’s eyes widen briefly, then he grimaces.<br/><br/>“No, Rio, I don’t smoke.”<br/><br/>“Miss Vidal.”<br/><br/>“You can just call me Billy,” he grins, and Rio bites the inside of her cheek to keep herself from laughing. The thing is, she can’t get mad at him— she’d have done the same.<br/><br/>“How’s Beast?” she asks, softening her posture. “How’s—”<br/><br/>Rio gets interrupted by a soft, warning shudder in her magic. She looks back and realizes:<br/><br/>“Shit. Agatha— <em> your mom </em> is out for my head,” she hisses through her teeth.<br/><br/>“Wonder what that’s like,” Billy says in a deeply sarcastic voice, but the anxious flicker in his eyes gives away the fact that he isn’t too happy about her arrival either. He ponders for a moment before he nods at the large boulder.<br/><br/>“Let’s hide in here,” he says with a sense of urgency. <br/><br/>“<em>In </em> here?” Rio repeats in a shocked whisper. “How, exactly, does one hide <em> inside </em> a rock?”<br/><br/>Billy rolls his eyes at her again. “Are you an earth witch, or what?”<br/><br/>Before she can protest his boldness, he walks around the boulder. Rio follows him and watches him place a palm against the surface— which starts to blur under his touch.<br/><br/>“A glamour spell?” Rio calls out, still trying to keep her voice low. She’s about to ask how in the <em> world </em> Billy can know about this, when the surface of the rock reveals a painting in front of her eyes.<br/><br/>Her breath hitches as two familiar creatures take shape, as if someone had smeared their images on the rock in different colors of dirt: the dragon, its wingspan wide and its nostrils flaring; and the griffin, claws out and ready, beak open in a silent screech.<br/><br/>“Fuck me,” Rio breathes.<br/><br/>“Language,” Billy grins, and drops his hand to a carved out opening in the rock which apparently functions as a door handle; Billy pulls on the stone as if it weighs nothing.<br/><br/>“<em>Rio Vidal! You can’t hide!” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “That’s mom,” Billy warns, and he slips through the opening in the rock. “C’mon, Rio.”<br/><br/>And she has no choice— Rio follows him through the opening. She’s barely stepped inside before the rock closes itself behind them, leaving them in complete darkness.<br/><br/>“Are we…” Rio speaks softly, jumping at the echo of her own voice. The space they’re in must be vast. “Are we safe here? Does she know of this place?”<br/><br/>“She doesn’t,” Billy assures her, and she chooses to believe him. “Can you… can you light a fire or something?”<br/><br/>Rio hums. Creating spontaneous fire as an earth witch is impossible, but it wouldn’t be the first time she’d find a way to bend the rules.<br/><br/>She reaches down and grabs a handful of dirt from the floor, cupping it between her palms, trying to feel the structure of it. She wills her magic to manipulate the molecules holding the earth together, gradually speeding them up, turning them warm, hot, hotter, until eventually—<br/><br/>A large flame bursts from her palms, lighting up a row of wall candles surrounding the large oval space they’re in, eventually ending its course in a dish in the middle of the room which serves as a campfire, fully lightening up the space and casting daunting shadows on the wall.<br/><br/>Rio pants a little as she remembers why she doesn’t do this often— once a fire has been ignited, she has no control over it. If they’re lucky to be alive, it’s not something she says to Billy out loud.<br/><br/>“That was <em> awesome,” </em> Billy shouts enthusiastically. “You’ll have to teach me that, one day!”<br/><br/>Rio chuckles nervously. “I’m afraid I can’t. It’s an earth trick— I have no idea how to do this with your spirit magic.”<br/><br/>Billy is about to comment on that, when suddenly an aggressive hissing noise echoes through the space.<br/><br/>Rio turns toward the source of the noise and feels her blood run cold— she looks down and sees the floor is covered by a large, too large an amount of snakes.<br/><br/>As a green witch, Rio loves all things nature. Every plant, flower, or blossom deserves proper care. Every animal, big or large, mammal or insect, deserves to be treated with respect.<br/><br/>Except <em> snakes. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> The exception to her fundamental principles.<br/><br/>And to make matters worse: among numerous slithering, hissing pythons, one larger specimen stands out: a cobra. An angry, clearly hostile cobra, risen up to an almost impressive height, ready to use its fangs to put its venom in the nearest living thing. </p><p>“No, no, no,” Rio stammers as her whole body begins to shake from adrenaline. “Fuck, no— I can’t do snakes, I can’t— <em> fuck!” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> She stumbles backward while keeping her eyes on the cobra, which keeps holding aggressive eye contact with her. Rio feels tears of fear prickle behind her eyes, and her heart beats so fast she fears she might be close to a heart attack.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry Billy, I can’t— <em> oh goddess!” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> The cobra snaps at her ankles and Rio launches herself at the stone door, pushing it open by slamming her entire body weight into it.<br/><br/>“Rio, no, wait!” she hears Billy behind her, but she is nearly deaf and blind from panic. Whatever wrath waits for her outside can never be as bad as a literal snake pit. She’d rather endure getting hexed into next weekend, than to turn into cobra food.<br/><br/>The second she steps outside, she catches a glimpse of the headmistress from the back; Agatha must have been trailing back off. Rio swears softly as the racket with which she had just escaped from the snakes makes Agatha turn back around, immediately locking onto Rio.<br/><br/><em> “Aha!”  </em></p><p>Rio is vaguely aware of Billy still being inside the snake pit when Agatha approaches her within a few strong strides.<br/><br/>“You think you’re so clever, don’t you?” The headmistress’ eyes blaze as she takes Rio in with a revolted look on her face.<br/><br/>“I told you— I will find you <em> anywhere, </em> Rio.”<br/><br/>The use of her first name, despite being spat out as if it were a curse word, throws Rio off so badly it temporarily makes her nauseous. <br/><br/>“You think you can sneak around in <em> my </em> castle without me finding you? You think you can <em> defy </em> me, spy on me, take me down?”<br/><br/>Agatha circles her like Rio is nothing more than a helpless prey in a cage.<br/><br/>“Well, um, no, actually—” Rio stammers eloquently, desperately trying to find the right words to save her from this situation.<br/><br/><em> “I don’t wanna hear it!” </em> Agatha snarls.<br/><br/>“Okay, but then maybe don’t ask m—”<br/><br/>“I told you before: one more toe out of line, and you’re fired! You don’t think purposely keeping my students from my class, or continuously eavesdropping on conversations that are none of your business qualify as reasons to make you pack your bags?” </p><p>Agatha could’ve easily pushed her back with magic; a gust of wind, a paralyzing spell, restraining her mind. Instead, she crosses the remaining distance between them, stepping into Rio’s aura so closely their chests almost touch, making Rio stumble backward against the hard rock. </p><p>
<em> “I detest you.”  </em>
</p><p>A visible shiver runs down Rio’s spine as she takes in the unrivaled hatred in Agatha’s piercing blue eyes. But before she can open her mouth she feels a by now familiar tug on her insides, a pull behind her eyes, a tugging sensation at her soul. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em> “I’m in love with you.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> A pair of desperate piercing blue eyes stares at her, only a few inches between her and Agatha. The lapels of Rio’s blazer are tightly held in Agatha’s fists, and Rio is backed up against a large boulder marking the spot by the lake where forest turns into mountain.  </em>
</p><p><em> Both girls are panting heavily, having just chased each other all the way out here. Agatha’s tense expression softens when a corner of Rio’s mouth curves up. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “You think I didn’t know that already?” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> Agatha’s jaw drops in offense, and she shakes Rio in her fists for good measure. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “You’re an asshole.” Agatha’s young voice lacks any form of malice. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “An asshole you’re in love with,” Rio sing-songs, deepening Agatha’s scowl. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> But when Rio bites a challenging lip, that scowl turns into something else completely— longing. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> Agatha longs for her.</em><em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> Rio can’t think of a better feeling in the whole entire world.<br/><br/></em><em>As a dark shade of red creeps up on Agatha's cheeks, and she looks like she's straining, confusion filling her eyes. <br/><br/>"I just lifted the glamour spell from the rock, Agatha. You know that affects the whole area. You can't hide that adorable blush from me here." <br/><br/>"I'm not blushing," Agatha blatantly lies, making Rio chuckle.  <br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “And now what?” Rio taunts her. “You gonna kiss me or something?” She wraps her hands around Agatha’s waist, softly squeezing her to pull her closer. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> Agatha exhales sharply. “No. Not if you don’t love me back. Asshole.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “Who says I don’t?” Rio quirks an eyebrow, letting her eyes drop to Agatha’s lips. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “Well? Do you?” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “Maybe.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> Agatha lets go of one side of Rio’s jacket to give her upper arm a smack. “Asshole!” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “You keep saying that,” Rio grins. “But you also still look like you’re about to kiss me.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> A few seconds pass, and Agatha blurts out: “Have you kissed someone before?” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “Does it matter?” Rio fires back. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> Agatha’s mouth turns into a thin line and she tilts her head. “I suppose it doesn’t.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “Then what are you waiting for?” Rio softly eggs her on, squeezing her waist once again. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> This time, it’s Agatha’s eyes that drop to Rio’s lips, and she audibly takes a breath which she holds. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em> “I need you to tell me,” Agatha whispers as she leans in. “Are you in love with me too?”<br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> Rio’s first thought when she gets transported back to the present is whether Agatha has just witnessed the same memory.<br/><br/>Rio’s second thought is what this heavy weight pressing her into the boulder behind her could be.<br/><br/>Her third, fourth, and fifth all blur together as she realizes Agatha’s lips are pressed against her own, her scent fills her nose, the sounds of her heavy breathing reaches her ears—<br/><br/>And for a moment, she lets herself lean into it. For a moment, she lets all these strange and confusing events be, losing herself in the sensation of this intimidating, gorgeous woman pressing her up against a rock, kissing her as if she wants to suck the life force out of her.<br/><br/>It doesn’t take longer than a few seconds before Agatha’s eyes fly open, and she goes absolutely rigid before pulling back like a snapped spring.<br/><br/>“What…?!” She shouts, taking a few large steps backward. “What is— what is this, Vidal?”<br/><br/>Agatha’s fury is back; and worse than it was before.<br/><br/>“You— you keep planting these images in my head! What kind of magic— you’re a <em> demon, </em> aren’t you?”<br/><br/>“I’m a <em> what?” </em> Rio laughs at the ridiculous deduction. “Agatha— I’m as in the dark as you are. I have no idea, I mean— <em> you </em> kissed <em> me </em> out of nowhere—”<br/><br/>Rio shrugs and lifts her hands, unsure what to say. Agatha seems to be in the same predicament, staring her down wordlessly.<br/><br/>The longer the headmistress’ eyes roam over her, the more vivid the memory of the kiss comes back to her.<br/><br/>Is Agatha a vicious, hateful woman? Yes.<br/><br/>Has she ever been nice to Rio? No.<br/><br/>Is there any reason Rio should’ve felt like she wanted <em> more </em> of that kiss? Absolutely the fuck not.<br/><br/>And yet— she doesn’t know whether it’s because of the memory, fake or not, that she had briefly felt like things were <em> normal </em> when Agatha kissed her. But what is normal supposed to be? What is her normal, their normal?<br/><br/>Rio gets so lost in her own thoughts that she doesn’t register Agatha’s debatably hungry look until a barely contained whimper sounds from Agatha’s throat. Rio gasps as Agatha’s eyes shoot back up from Rio’s hips and her cheeks darken in color.<br/><br/>Rio's core throbs once, violently, desperately, before a bubble of laughter escapes her throat.<br/><br/>“Are you— Agatha, are you coming on to me right now?” she says incredulously.<br/><br/>That seems to shake Agatha up; she shivers, turns back into her malignant self and raises her hands in preparation of cursing Rio to hell—<br/><br/>But as soon as her hands come into view, Rio notices that Agatha’s fingers, from the tip down to the second knuckle, are stained pitch black. Agatha looks surprised by her own hands and quickly drops them, starts to walk backward to create as much space between her and Rio as possible.<br/><br/>“This isn’t over,” she hisses, tucking her hands into her sleeves before turning around and walking back to the tunnel.<br/><br/>Rio feels a severe headache creeping up from everything that had just transpired, before a rush of clarity makes her call out: “Hey, wait! So am I fired, or nah?” </p><p>Agatha doesn’t look back.</p><p>“Don't you have a class to teach?” </p>

<p>It isn’t long after that eventful encounter by the lake that Rio decides she needs to investigate more actively. Where she had half-heartedly convinced herself that the whole memory thing could’ve been her own mind playing tricks on her, she now knows for sure something more mysterious is going on. And not just a simple memory spell.</p><p>Someone had tried to erase something big. Something life altering. </p><p>Agatha must’ve come to the same conclusion by now. </p><p>Walking the familiar outside path through the forest, back to the castle—there is no way she is going back through that tunnel—she brushes her lightly swollen bottom lip with her thumb. </p><p>Rio doubts she’s ever had that many conflicting feelings at the same time. The memory, the look, <em> the kiss…  </em></p><p>The headmistress absolutely terrifies her, yes. But still, her lips were soft, her breath felt warm on her skin, smelling faintly like lavender. Rio had wanted more of it.</p><p>It makes her feel totally pathetic. Truth be told: Agatha could’ve snapped her spine like a twig and she’d probably still be mesmerized by her eyes, turquoise-blue like the lake where it had all transpired. </p><p>After Agatha had left, Rio had poked her head through the gate in the boulder to report back to Billy, only to find out he had vanished— the snakes still angrily hissing before she dipped back out. </p><p>Must’ve found another secret passageway, the cocky brat. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio returns to the teacher’s lounge after absent-mindedly teaching her second class of the day, accidentally growing teeth on a sunflower, the first thing she notices is a dark kind of tension hanging in the room. She takes a few steps toward her own portrait when her eyes land on Agatha’s; the usual mellow swirls of purple magic in the background have made way for three large thunderclouds, each one sparking a purple bolt of lightning every few seconds. </p><p>A surprised huff leaves Rio’s mouth, followed by a humorless chuckle behind her. When she turns around, she realizes Lilia is sitting on one of the velvet sofas with her arms crossed, Castor perched on her shoulder, an amused expression on her face. Rio lifts her eyebrows and scratches the corner of her mouth with her pinky. </p><p>“She in a mood?” Rio asks airily, nodding at Agatha’s portrait. </p><p>“Oh, that happens,” Lilia shrugs. “At <em> least </em>once every month, if you get my gist. Could’ve been a student pissing her off too, or—”</p><p><em> Or a teacher, </em>Rio finishes in her head. </p><p>A moment later, Castor starts to croak; a low, ragged sound. He claps his beak a couple times and screeches: “A-ga-tha.” </p><p>“That’s right, my dear,” Lilia nods, blindly reaching up to stroke a finger along the length of his beak. He shudders, and follows up: “Riiiiiii-o.” </p><p>“Smart bird,” Lilia coos, summoning a treat for him to nibble on. Castor ignores the treat however, and starts repeating himself loudly. “A-ga-tha. Riiiiii-o. A-ga-tha. Riiiiii-o.” </p><p>As Lilia cranes her neck to look at him, clearly confused, the hairs on Rio’s arms start to rise up. </p><p>
<em> Of course. Castor’s brother, Pollux, might remember them.  </em>
</p><p>“Lilia— Didn’t you say Pollux could travel through time?” she inquires casually, approaching the sofa with the grace of a panther to take a seat next to Lilia. She reaches a finger out, on which Castor happily starts to nibble. “Riiiii-o.” </p><p>“Mm,” Lilia hums non-committally. </p><p>“Could he— um, let’s say your memories about a certain event that’s already happened are unclear. Would he be able to retrieve information from the past?” </p><p>Lilia sighs, directing her eyes forward, deliberately not looking at Rio. “He used to.” </p><p>“He used to?” Rio blinks, waiting for an explanation. </p><p>“He isn’t exactly a spry chicken anymore,” the older woman says with a smile that doesn’t quite reach her eyes. </p><p>“Chicken!” Castor calls out— Rio swears he sounds offended. </p><p>“It’s why my powers are deteriorating. My divination— it’s weakening.” </p><p>Rio holds her breath to not startle Lilia or Castor with her surprise, and her brows knit together in concern. Just as she is about to ask if Lilia knows why her powers are weakening, she watches Lilia’s eyes dart to the entrance, making sure they’re alone. Then she spreads her arms, and from her necklace shoots a bright white light, taking the shape of her second raven. He flaps his wings twice before perching on Lilia’s other shoulder. </p><p>“Castor and Pollux used to have another sibling. Phoebe.” </p><p>“You had <em> three </em> familiars?” Rio breathes in awe, jaw dropping. </p><p>Lilia nods once, controlled. “Pollux travels back and forth for me now, but it hasn’t always been like that. He used to only fly to the future. Phoebe would venture into the past.” </p><p>Rio looks at the two birds on Lilia’s shoulder and tries to imagine a third, equally impressive, black raven hovering between them. “What happened?” </p><p>“One day, I felt the urge to let all three of them out at once. Something I never did— and for good reason. But they were persistent, so I summoned them. Out of nowhere, Pollux started attacking Phoebe’s eyes, rendering her blind at first.” </p><p>Lilia takes a deep breath and straightens her shoulders. Rio notices the older woman is welling up, so she tentatively places her hand on top of Lilia’s. </p><p>“I could feel her pain. It was mortifying, Rio. I couldn’t do anything to— I started to lose my own vision.” </p><p>Lilia’s hand starts trembling under hers as she takes another deep breath. “I had no choice— no choice but to—” </p><p>Rio hums in understanding when she connects the dots, so Lilia doesn’t have to say it out loud. </p><p>“She was bleeding out anyway, and— and I’m not sure—”</p><p>“And Castor?” Rio asks softly. “He was there, wasn’t he?” </p><p>“He watched it all go down from a distance. Just sat there, didn’t do anything. Like he had orchestrated it all.” </p><p>Rio slowly exhales when she feels the weight of what this all means. “Did you not feel resentment toward them?” she asks, her gaze shifting between Castor and Pollux. </p><p>“Of course I did,” Lilia answers, finally looking up at Rio. “But they’re a part of <em> me, </em>dear. The only thing left to feel is remorse.” </p><p>Rio locks eyes with the older woman and tries to read the many heavy thoughts and feelings among her unshed tears. She can’t even imagine what it must feel like; to kill a part of yourself to save another. To have to watch a part of yourself attack another part of yourself— and still find it within you to love them. To love yourself. </p><p>“I’m so sorry,” is all Rio has left to say. “Fuck. That’s— I’m so sorry.” </p><p>Lilia smiles at her; a genuine one this time. “Così va la vita.”</p><p>Rio has many more questions, but she asks her most pressing one: “I appreciate you telling me this, Lilia. But— why? Why trust me with this? Why now?” </p><p>“I know you’ve lost something, child,” Lilia simply answers. “I don’t know what it is, but you lost it, and we all miss it. Whatever <em> it </em>is.”</p><p>Rio chews the inside of her cheek as she contemplates asking Lilia how much she knows. “You— you’ve been reciting parts of a prophecy, ever since I arrived here,” she says. “The same prophecy that keeps showing up in my dreams. And I was wondering…” </p><p>She trails off, her eyes drifting toward the restless portrait of the headmistress. “From the day I set foot back in this castle, I keep getting flashes of memories. Memories I think I’ve lost, from when I was still a student here. And I was wondering if the prophecy has something to do with… that. With me. And if you happen to know the complete version.” </p><p>Lilia nods, almost as if this information is not new to her. “I don’t,” she says, still nodding. It’s confusing. </p><p>“Okay— but do you— do you think Pollux might be able to find something?” </p><p>She can almost read the ‘no’ in Lilia’s eyes, who looks up at Pollux as if to ask for his opinion. </p><p>“A-ga-tha. Riiiiiii-o.” </p><p>Lilia makes a surprised humming sound. “He seems to think so.” </p><p>The bird does indeed look like he has made up his mind when he takes off from Lilia’s shoulder and starts circling above their heads. “A-ga-tha. Riiiiiiii-o.” </p><p>Lilia looks over at Castor, who is calmly taking in his brother, and then aims her gaze at Rio. Rio gives her a measured but determined nod. </p><p>“Pollux!” Lilia calls out, her voice strong and projecting through the space.<em> “Oculi tui sint memoriae meae. Aures tui sint experientia meae. Cor tui sit praeteritum meae. Nam anima tua, in aeternum, ego sum.”  </em></p><p>The raw power emanating from Lilia’s chest makes Rio’s teeth rattle, just like the table-ware inside the cupboards. </p><p>It’s over almost before it starts— Pollux disappears into thin air without as much as a sound. </p><p>“And now what?” Rio asks, a bit breathless, eyes darting back to Lilia.</p><p>“And now, we wait.” <br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Pollux is gone for one entire night and one entire day. </p><p>Rio is almost in the exact same spot on the sofa when he materializes in front of her. Only this time, she’s alone. </p><p>“Rrrrrrrrrrrr,” sounds a gurgle from his beak. Rio is concerned for a second, but then Pollux graciously dives down and firmly plants his feet on top of Rio’s right knee. She winces at his sharp little claws digging into her flesh. </p><p>“Hey bud,” she greets him, sticking out her finger for him to nibble on. “Did you find—” </p><p>That’s when she sees a small, crumpled up piece of parchment wedged between his beak. “Oh!” </p><p>Her heart rate picks up at the prospect of what this could be. “Is this—?”</p><p>Pollux opens his mouth with a dramatic screeching noise, like an old door in need of grease. </p><p>Rio carefully plucks the parchment from his beak, her fingers shaking with sudden tension. </p><p>This could be it. This little piece of paper could contain a lot of answers to her questions. </p><p>Maybe it will even tell her about Agatha. </p><p>As she unfolds it and realizes what she’s looking at, her head spins from both excitement and disappointment. It becomes clear pretty quickly that she is, in fact, holding the original parchment on which the prophecy was written during a time she doesn’t remember. It is also, very clearly, not complete. </p><p> </p><p>

<em><br/>
A new moon, the night is prime </em>
</p><p>
<em> the first is born, an heir of time </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Nourished by his gift for speed </em>
</p><p>
<em> for he is brave and born to lead  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The second boy, one to admire </em>
</p><p>
<em> master of his own desire </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> His head is clear, his mind is strong </em>
</p><p>
<em> a compass telling right from wrong  </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>There is a large tear at the underside of the parchment, like someone has ripped it in half. Rio carefully strokes the surface with her finger, as if she can feel some sort of connection with her unknown past. </p><p>“Thank you,” she whispers at the bird. “‘<em>The first is born’</em>,” she murmurs, “And <em> ‘the second boy</em>’. Who is this about?” she wonders out loud, even though she has an unsettling suspicion. </p><p>She shoots a watery smile at Pollux, who starts tapping his beak against the parchment with a sense of urgency. </p><p>“Do you think…?” Rio looks up and points at the clock, whirling her finger in counter-clockwise circles. “Is there more?” </p><p>“Riiiiiii-o,” Pollux says in confirmation. Rio exhales slowly and nods at him. </p><p>“Alright. Good luck, Pollux. Safe travels.” </p><p>As she folds up the parchment and lets it slide into the inside pocket of her jacket, the bird on her knee takes off, circles her once, then picks up speed. He dives behind a pillar and vanishes again, just like yesterday.</p><p>“What the <em> fuck?!”  </em></p><p>An astonished yell makes Rio look up. Jennifer stands in the doorway of her own quarters, her portrait swung open, one foot still inside, one in the teacher’s lounge. Her jaw is practically on the floor. When she realizes Rio isn’t going to say anything, she steps out and determinedly strides toward her. </p><p>“Was that Lilia’s bird?” </p><p>“Um—” No point denying it, really. “Yeah. Pollux.” </p><p>“The time travel one? Did he just take orders from <em> you?” </em> She sounds completely in awe, but not hostile, exactly. </p><p>“I guess,” Rio shrugs and tries to chuckle to wave it off, but even she can tell her performance is highly unbelievable. Jennifer’s unimpressed expression confirms that. </p><p>“Tea time,” she declares without much room for protesting, and plops down onto the sofa next to Rio, who realizes she has about 2.5 seconds to determine how much she wants to share with Jennifer. </p><p>Then she looks over at Agatha’s portrait again, which has calmed down since yesterday, and decides that whatever it is that made Agatha hate her— she can probably use some friends on her side. </p><p>Besides, she <em> likes </em>Jennifer, despite the water witch coming on too strong sometimes. She’d be a good ally to have, and a powerful witch. </p><p>“So…” Rio clears her throat, shifts awkwardly in her seat, and tucks one of her legs under herself. “Alright. Something strange is going on. With this place, with me, with Agatha—” </p><p>“Of <em> course </em>it has something to do with her,” Jennifer enthusiastically calls out, quickly pressing her lips together at Rio’s warning look. “Sorry. Go on.” </p><p>Rio, against better judgement, starts telling her story. The things that happened these past few weeks, the things she doesn’t remember. The memories coming back to her, the prophecy. The only information she leaves out is Agatha’s secret room in the dungeons, and the kiss.</p><p>“Damn,” Jennifer drawls out in a low voice. “This is <em> so </em>interesting. I mean— horrifying, but interesting.” </p><p>“Does it get even more horrifying when I say I think Wanda has something to do with this?” Rio adds, remembering the chaos witch in her dreams. “I wish I could talk to her, but—”</p><p>“She hasn’t been seen in over ten years,” Jennifer finishes for her. “Which you should be happy about. She might blow your head clean off.” </p><p>“I don’t know if I believe that,” Rio admits. “I knew her, back in school. She never seemed… malicious, or violent.” </p><p>“But you just told me you don’t remember much from your time here?” Jennifer raises a brow. “So you don’t actually know if or when she turned into this evil enigma.” </p><p>Rio exhales and slumps down a bit. “True,” she reluctantly admits. “She could’ve secretly been a walking time bomb this whole time.” </p><p>They stay silent for a bit, until Jennifer turns toward Rio with a knowing smile. “Would you be open to trying a rememory potion?” </p><p>“A rememory potion?” </p><p>“It works like an antidote for memory potions. You said you don’t know <em> how </em>you lost your memories— but if it’s a potion, you might get them back by drinking it.” </p><p>Rio squints in suspicion, letting the suggestion simmer. </p><p>“And if it <em>wasn’t</em> a potion that took my memories?” </p><p>“Then you’ll grow hives and blisters. But don’t worry, they only appear around the groin area—”</p><p>Rio instinctively slams her thighs shut, putting her hands over her crotch. “What?! You’re not actually serious?!” </p><p>Jennifer immediately starts cackling, head thrown back, one of her hands landing on Rio’s knees. “I’m not. If I’d known you’re this easy to mess with, I would’ve done it way sooner.” </p><p>It is then that another portrait swings open; both Jennifer and Rio look up to watch Agatha step into the teacher’s lounge. She has foregone her long coat, only wearing slacks and a white blouse, sleeves rolled up to above the elbows. </p><p>During the couple of seconds Agatha needs to take in the scene before her, Rio vaguely wonders why Agatha always looks <em> so </em>mouth-watering. It’d be easier to hate her back if she was slightly more off-putting. </p><p>
<em> Alas.  </em>
</p><p>Rio watches the headmistress’ gaze land on Jennifer’s hand, and her nose scrunches up. </p><p>“Vidal,” she barks, though her voice lacks its usual vigor. “Can I talk to you?” </p><p>A small amused sound bubbles out of Rio. “Was that an actual <em> question?”  </em></p><p>Motivated by Jennifer’s snicker in her ear, she continues: “I don’t think I’ve heard anything but commands from your mouth, so far.” </p><p>Agatha bears her teeth. “If you don’t come with me right now, the next thing from my mouth will be a hex.” </p><p>So Agatha chooses to be the antagonist, even after their moment in the woods? Fine. That’s <em> fine.  </em></p><p>But Rio will no longer be intimidated by someone with such soft lips. </p><p>“I’m good here.” She treats the headmistress to a wide smile and throws her feet up on the coffee table. Agatha’s eyes narrow, and Jennifer lets out an impressed whistle— but ducks behind Rio regardless, scared of being caught in the crossfire. </p><p>“What was that?” Agatha challenges her in a low grumble. </p><p>“I said: I’m comfortable where I am right now, headmistress Harkness.” Rio stretches her arms up and behind her neck, reveling in the rebellious feeling she remembers from being a teenager. </p><p>Agatha’s cheekbones turn so dark, they almost look purple. She exhales through her nose; alert and dangerous, reminding Rio of a dragon huffing smoke from its nostrils. </p><p>“Anything you want to discuss with me, you can do it right here,” Rio declares, a winning smirk on her face. </p><p><em> I’ve tasted your lips, Agatha, </em> she thinks. <em> I’ve had your breath on my face. Your waist against mine. You wanted me.  </em></p><p>Agatha visibly strains to slacken her own shoulders, as if she’s putting all of her energy into not bursting out in flames. </p><p>“We can do this your way, Vidal,” she speaks calmly. “That greasy rat of yours— you think he’ll scream if I turn him into a porcupine, using him as a dartboard?” </p><p>A wave of wicked anger flows through Rio’s body so violently, it makes her jolt right up from the couch. “He’s an <em> armadillo,” </em>she grits through her teeth, feeling the earth vibrate around her. “And you wouldn’t.” </p><p>Agatha’s jaw drops mockingly, a hand flying to her chest. “Wouldn’t I?” </p><p>“<em>I fucking dare you.” </em>Rio imagines Agatha harming as much as a single scale on Reaper’s back— she has no doubt the entire castle will come down. </p><p>“Just go with her,” Jennifer whispers behind her, and Rio knows it’s the right thing to do, but she needs Agatha to know what happens if she messes with her or Reaper. She feels her magic inadvertently making cracks in the stone beneath Agatha’s feet, ready to unleash whatever her earth magic will be able to gather. </p><p>Instead of looking scared, Agatha just rolls her eyes. “Don’t be like that.” She waves a careless hand and Rio blinks in surprise— her grip on her own magic is gone. It makes her feel weirdly naked. </p><p>“What did you—” </p><p>“Any fight you start against a spirit witch, she will finish,” Agatha simply says. “Ready to follow me?” </p><p><em> “</em>Just <em> go!” </em>Jennifer presses, and Rio lets out a frustrated huff. </p><p>“Fine. Fucking creep,” she sneers at Agatha. </p><p>To her surprise, Agatha nods at her own purple portrait. “Up here,” she says, before disappearing through the doorway and up the stairs. </p><p>Rio feels her magic slowly flowing back into her, and she sighs in relief. Before she follows Agatha up to her chambers, she turns around to Jennifer and traces a horizontal line across her neck, adding some dramatic choking noises for effect. </p><p>Jennifer’s chuckle sounds pitiful. “If I don’t see you again in the next 24 hours, I’m sending Bug up.” </p><p>“Great,” Rio deadpans. “What’s he gonna do, show her his favorite rock?” She shakes her head and awkwardly waves at Jennifer before trailing behind the headmistress up the stairs, her feet dragging like she’s on her way to the gallows. </p><p>She instantly forgets to mope as soon as she reaches the top of the stairs and realizes there are more doors; two of them closed, one of which must be leading to Agatha’s bedroom. A third, open door leads to what looks like a large, round office space. </p><p>Damn, being the headmistress must pay off. </p><p>Rio follows Agatha into her office, where the headmistress pointedly turns around and leans her hips backward against her desk. A gust of wind betrays the door behind Rio magically swinging closed, and she makes a point to distribute her weight evenly on both feet. </p><p>“Rio.” </p><p>The unexpected use of her first name has her making a confused sound in the back of her throat. She crosses her arms in defense.<br/>
<br/>
”Sup?”</p><p>“I won’t pretend I don’t loathe being in the same room as you. I didn’t bring you in here to have a civil conversation, to make amends, nor to make your life hell.” </p><p>“Okay,” Rio says defiantly. “If we’re listing all the things you <em> didn’t </em>ask me to come in here for, we’re gonna be here a while—” </p><p>“Quiet,” Agatha snaps. “I’m going to ask you once, and only once,” she announces, before looking Rio up and down. For the second time in five minutes, Rio feels naked. </p><p>“I need you to stop putting those memories in my head. The dreams. They mess up my magic— which, as you know, can be dangerous for the school.” </p><p>Rio just blinks at her, absolutely gobsmacked at the implication. </p><p>“I don’t even care how you do it,” Agatha continues, and it’s strangely the most human Rio has ever seen her. “I just need it to <em> stop.”  </em></p><p>“Agatha,” Rio uncrosses her arms and stretches them out to interrupt her. “Wait, wait. You think <em> I’m </em>the one putting memories in your head? Who’s the spirit witch here?” </p><p>“Well, I know <em>I’m </em>not the one doing it,” Agatha replies sharply, aggressively tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. </p><p>“Neither am I!” </p><p>“And you expect me to believe that? Because you’ve proven to be so trustworthy?” Agatha’s strong gaze slices right through her. </p><p>Rio opens and closes her mouth but no sound comes out— too many thoughts at the same time get triggered. “I don’t— I don’t even know what to <em> say! </em>I’m not doing this! I’m suffering just as bad as you!” </p><p>The headmistress jots her chin up, guarding her crumbling demeanor. “I promise I won’t tell anyone,” she says in a mocking tone, “how a measly little earth witch like you is able to pull this <em> fucked up </em>stunt.” </p><p>“Fantastic!” Rio screeches, throwing her arms up. “Because there <em> is </em> nothing to tell! I <em> am </em> just a measly little earth witch!” </p><p>“And you reek like one, too.” </p><p>“The fuck does that mean?” </p><p>“Does your kind even shower, or do you just roll over in the mud like a pig?” </p><p>And for lack of a better response, Rio starts to laugh. “Agatha— why is this getting <em> personal? </em>What are you implying? What do you have against earth witches?” </p><p>“Scum of the earth,” Agatha says haughtily, whipping her head away from Rio to look out the window. “Where do you think that expression comes from?” </p><p>“I can’t even take you seriously right now,” Rio laughs scornfully. “Do you hear yourself talk, or—”</p><p>Before Rio can finish her sentence, Agatha pushes herself off of the desk and presses her left hand against Rio’s chest, making her stumble backward against the wall. </p><p>“Let me in,” Agatha hisses, poking against Rio’s forehead with a finger of her other hand. “Let me in that ridiculously juvenile mind of yours, so I can stop whatever it is you’re doing.” </p><p>“By all means!” Rio shrieks, chest heaving from Agatha’s sudden violent behavior. “Have a look around, take a seat, help yourself to a drink! I don’t have anything to hide, Agatha!” </p><p>The hand on her chest balls into a fist, Rio’s shirt tight between Agatha’s knuckles. Agatha opens her mouth to fire another threat, when suddenly—</p><p>“Scrrrrrrratchy.” </p><p>Agatha whips her head around and Rio peaks over her shoulder to see what’s going on. Under Agatha’s desk, the white-and-caramel rabbit Rio had seen during her first week is nibbling on a piece of white cabbage. Pollux is perched on the desk, his body bent all the way down, showing a nearly obsessive interest in whatever the rabbit is doing. </p><p>“Now what is that wretched bird doing in here?” </p><p>Agatha sounds like she’s about to lose her mind— and Rio can’t blame her. The grip on her shirt loosens and Agatha steps away, making hissing sounds at the raven. </p><p>“Kssh! Shoo! Get away from Scratchy with those dirty feathers!” </p><p>Too many things are happening at once, but there’s one thing Rio can’t let go: “<em>Scratchy? </em> Your familiar is a white bunny and his name… is <em> Scratchy?!”  </em></p><p>“Not. A. <em>Word</em>,” Agatha warns her, pointing a finger at Rio without even looking at her. </p><p>“Um, yes, I have many words, actually. <em> Scratchy, </em> Agatha? The big bad evil witch has a bunny named <em> Scratchy?”  </em></p><p>Agatha turns back around with a lethal fire in her eyes. “Let me warn you, Vidal. If you <em> look </em>at him wrong, I’ll have you drown in the deepest part of the lake.” </p><p>Ah, back to her last name it is.</p><p>“Bold of you to want to threaten Reaper with acupuncture then!” </p><p>“Scrrrrratchy.” </p><p>Pollux clicks his beak and pulls Agatha and Rio from their pointless argument. Agatha looks at the bird, then at the bunny, and crouches down. </p><p>“What are you eating, sweetheart?” Agatha murmurs in such a soft and sweet voice, Rio is seconds away from a whiplash. “What is— a piece of paper? How did you—” </p><p>When the penny drops, Rio gasps and dives down next to Agatha. “Wait!” she yells in growing panic. “Don’t let him eat it!” </p><p>Then, it happens fast: Rio reaches out to tear the parchment from Scratchy’s mouth, but Agatha’s instincts kick in and she wraps her hand around Rio’s wrist so tightly it makes her whimper. </p><p>“No, wait,” she groans as she feels Agatha’s nails dig into her flesh. “Let me explain— this is important!” </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes at her, plucks the parchment from Rio’s fingers before releasing her. Rio starts panting in relief and drops her head. </p><p>“You have three seconds to start talking.” </p><p>“Okay, okay!” Rio jolts up and scrambles onto her knees. “This,” she says, pointing at the parchment in Agatha’s hand, “this might be the key to those weird memories and dreams. I get them too. I don’t know how or why either. But I know there’s a prophecy— it keeps popping up, I’m sure it’s important—” </p><p>“A new moon, the night is prime,” Agatha mutters. </p><p>“<em>Yes!” </em> Rio gasps. “That’s the one! You saw it too!” </p><p>“It’s not real,” Agatha huffs, but Rio can tell from the look in her eyes that she isn’t even convinced of her own statement. </p><p>“It is, <em> it is!” </em>Rio presses on. “And you’re holding a part of the original! Pollux went back in time to retrieve the parts he could find, and—” </p><p>“Who went what now?” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter.” Rio shakes her head. “What matters is what you’re holding in your hand. Our answers might be on there. Agatha, please.” </p><p>That’s when Rio remembers the other piece tucked in her inside pocket. She takes it out without breaking eye contact. </p><p>“Here. This is the first part.” She folds it open and shows Agatha the contents, raising her brows in conviction. She watches the headmistress’ eyes skim over the parchment and sigh in defeat. </p><p>“Who is this heir, even? And the second boy? Sounds like a nighttime story to me.” </p><p>“Sure. One hell of a nighttime story if it’s the exact thing that keeps the both of us up at night.” </p><p>“Fine,” Agatha says. “Here, read whatever it is that bird tried to kill my rabbit with.” </p><p>Rio decides not to comment on that and takes the crumpled up paper from Agatha’s hand. The first thing she notices as she reveals the words written inside, is that the edges are frayed, moist— no doubt chomped on by Agatha’s familiar. It’s far smaller than the other piece; it contains only one sentence.</p><p>“No, no, <em> no,” </em> Rio whines, holding up the parchment between thumb and forefinger. “Look what he <em> did! </em>It’s gone! All gone!” </p><p>“<em>Most </em>of it is gone,” Agatha corrects her half-heartedly. “And the ink better not be poisonous to him.” </p><p>“The ink— Agatha, the key to our memories could’ve been on here!” she wiggles the parchment for emphasis. “And your bunny ate it!” </p><p>“So let the bird go back in time five minutes,” Agatha mumbles. </p><p>“Not sure that’s how that works, now that it’s destroyed,” Rio responds in an annoyed growl. </p><p>“If he can only retrieve it from the past if it’s still intact in the present, the original still has to exist in the current timeline, doesn’t it?” Agatha rattles off quick. </p><p>And even though Rio can’t argue with that: “Oh, that’s right!” She smacks her own forehead. “Let me just go grab it!” </p><p>“You know where it is?” </p><p>“No, of course not!” </p><p>“Then why did you—”</p><p>“See the fucking problem?!” Rio points at the gnawed on parchment again. Both women sigh in frustration. </p><p>“Well, let’s just fucking read what’s on it,” Agatha tries to change the subject, taking the paper back from Rio’s fingers. </p><p>As the headmistress reads the single sentence on it, Rio watches her expression go from surprised, to contemplating, to realization, to total absence. </p><p>“Agatha…?” </p><p>“I told you.” Agatha wipes her nose with the back of her hand. “Fucking pieces of shit. All of you— <em> earth witches.”  </em></p><p>The last two words are pronounced with so much vile hatred, Rio feels a sharp pain in her chest, even without any idea of why Agatha speaks them in the first place. </p><p>Agatha gets up and throws the parchment carelessly over her shoulder; Rio catches it in the air. </p><p> </p><p>

<em> His downfall comes when She who seeds </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Rio’s eyes start to prick as the merciless words on the paper start to make sense. <em> ‘She who seeds.’ </em>An earth witch. </p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Oh, fuck no. </p><p>Will she cause someone’s downfall? </p><p>No, that doesn’t make sense— the prophecy must’ve already happened. Why else would she have lost her memories over it? </p><p>His downfall. <em> Whose </em>downfall? </p><p>Oh goddess.</p><p>What had she done? </p><p>And to whom? </p>
