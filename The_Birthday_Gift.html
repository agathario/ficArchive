<h2 class="toc-heading">The Birthday Gift</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Canorous and insistent, the club breathed its potential into the quiet street. With every wave of its heavy door it billowed the promise of a ripe feeding ground onto the damp sidewalk.</p><p>Rio Vidal stood in the shadows, watching without really seeing.</p><p>An establishment like this was rare these days. People were frightened, which meant creatures like Rio were hungry. Only Rio Vidal wasn’t the kind of creature to frequent a place such as this. She preferred to keep a low profile; preferred to hunt, instead of gather.</p><p>She sought out those who didn’t fear retribution, but got it anyway. She picked off the damned and the dirty and survived rather than delighted.</p><p>But sometimes, only sometimes, would she treat herself to a prize; a gift, she reasoned. A present to herself for being good for a decade at a time.</p><p>A pretty, willing, girl to take, to drink.</p><p>And today just so happened to be her three hundredth birthday. Her thirtieth treat.</p><p>The glow of her cigarette lit up her face, highlighting the gold in her coffee-dark irises as she watched a tall man in a long coat walk out of the club hand in hand with a scantily clad blonde. She studied them from a while, breathing in the scent of the human, tasting the sweetness of her blood in the air, even through the acrid scent of the cigarette.</p><p>Not her type, she thought as she dropped the cigarette and stamped it out with heavy leather boots bought especially for the occasion.</p><p>It was all part of the ritual. A hand-rolled cigarette - pure tobacco, none of that filter shit that appeared seventy years ago. The cigarette dulled her enough so she wasn’t too reactive, didn’t devour before she was able to savour. She’d made that mistake on birthdays one through eleven.</p><p>The acrid smoke allowed her a slither of a second to compute before she reacted. Sometimes it was more necessary than others.</p><p>The boots, like her outfit, were new. She’d spent the day trawling the most expensive shops on Oak Street for the perfect outfit. She wore a black mini dress and tights courtesy of Prada, and a black leather jacket courtesy of The Row.</p><p>Simple, unassuming, but she looked good. She wanted to attract after all.</p><p>Down the street the tall man and his conquest veered off to a nearby alley and Rio turned from them, never one for communal meals.</p><p>It was just after midnight and therefore seven days and seven hours since she’d last fed. Her last meal had been a pimp who preferred his girls to be returned beaten.</p><p>He’d tasted of ash and unripened fruit. Rio had beaten him before she fed from him.</p><p>The door to the club swung open again and this time, without the curling safety of the cigarette smoke, Rio’s lungs filled with a scent that made her gums ache. There was a richness on the air, a mélange of her kin and the humans they were there to pick from.</p><p>Notes of dirtier bloods could be picked out at will. There was someone who was diabetic and running low on insulin - a delicacy to some. Others smelled more sweet like the woman Rio now knew to be in the alley. Then others were more sour, some bitter, some tart.</p><p>And one, one scent flew above the others, rising above the tide that wafted through the open door like a welcoming hand inviting her inside.</p><p>And who was Rio to refuse? It was her birthday after all.</p><p>She strode across the deserted street, barely paying any mind to the distant sounds of a meal being consumed from the nearby alley and stepped inside the warm, dark club.</p><p>The noise she’d heard every time the door swung open had been tolerable from afar, when heard in quick snippets, but now it was merciless and seemed to Rio entirely unnecessary.</p><p>The humans here were here willingly, were thrilled to be the play things and the prey of the creatures who stalked them at the bar, on the dance floor, in the small rooms off to the sides where they could take their meals privately if they wished. They all either sought death or something far darker. Thumping music wouldn’t make them any more desperate to fulfil their clandestine desires.</p><p>It was part of the show, Rio knew. Just like her own little ritual, her decision to dress up for the sake of whichever human she picked for the night. The music added a sense of occasion to the place; without it this would just be another dark room for dark deeds.</p><p>She moved slowly through the writhing bodies, unconsciously moving so the scent she’d picked up earlier grew stronger in her nostrils with every step and the threat of her fangs dropping without warning built to an almost unbearable peak.</p><p>Her back to the wall, her gaze swept over the bodies as they danced and petted and grinded until she laid eyes on the woman she knew already would be hers for the night. The perfect treat for her perfect birthday.</p><p>Off at the edge of the dance floor stood a beautiful woman with long brown hair that fell in waves along her back. Her burgundy dress left little to the imagination but people didn’t come here to imagine. They came here to enact their fantasies, to bring their quiet desires to biting, rapacious reality. The woman was pressed up against another, a tall redhead, whose fangs were on display and whose hands were unable to decide where to rest on her conquest’s body.</p><p>It was pathetic to watch, really. And Rio smirked a little to herself as she watched the two of them. The human was unlike anyone she’d seen before. She carried herself with an arrogant turn of her chin, as if she knew she was desirable and could have anyone in this room.</p><p>Most humans here were submissive by nature, they would play to their predator’s ego by kowtowing to them as much as necessary. Nearby, a man was on his hands and knees, his face buried beneath the skirt of a vampire Rio recognised but didn’t know the name of. The sight wasn’t uncommon.</p><p>But across from her, this human stood tall, looked fully in control. It was the vampire against her who looked desperate, almost unsure. And Rio almost laughed at the sight of her trying to figure out what to do next. Rio’s dark eyes moved from her kin to the human, and she took her time in letting her gaze caress over her body, taking in the curve of her taught calves, the arch of her ass, the cut of her jaw. She was a perfect specimen. The vampire with her had no idea what to do with all that.</p><p>But Rio did.</p><p>She began to make her way over, deciding she could no longer stand watching the woman being wasted on an imbecile like the vampire she’d picked for the night. Just as she was approaching, the human in question looked up. They locked eyes, Rio’s golden brown meeting piercing blue and Rio breathed in heavily, drawing out the pleasure of having such a scent so close.</p><p>The blue-eyed bleeder looked momentarily transfixed and Rio saw that she was checking her out, that she was regretting being pressed up against someone so pathetically desperate she couldn’t keep her fangs in her mouth.</p><p>And Rio simply raised her brows at her, daring her to come the rest of the way to her, daring her to present herself to her.</p><p>The woman caught this look, seemed to understand it, and turned from Rio to look back at the redhead and Rio watched the interaction carefully, her own body tense suddenly, ready to react if necessary.</p><p>She saw the woman smile, watched her shake her head and pull away a little, saw the way the red head’s hold tightened. And Rio heard the human’s heart beat pick up. It was subtle, but the rhythm had changed enough for Rio to know that though this woman was brave, she wasn’t stupid.</p><p>Most of Rio’s kind didn’t take well to being refused. Even the newbies. Hell, if this woman refused Rio she wasn’t sure what she’d do either. Probably something stupid.</p><p>She moved then and flew across the space in time to prevent the red head’s ready fangs from dipping into the unwilling flesh of the woman. And in doing so felt her heart drop.</p><p>Up close, her arm speared between the human and the now furious redhead, the scent she’d detected from outside was overwhelming. She held her breath as she bared down on the vampire before her, feeling hands slide around her from behind. This woman wasn’t just brave, she was incredible.</p><p>But the redhead cowered back as Rio knew she would. She was young, that much was easy to tell. She looked green and inexperienced and Rio was anything but.</p><p>The arms that were around her tightened their hold as the redhead left with one last furious look and Rio heard a sultry voice in her ear: “See something you like?”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes briefly, the proximity and the comfort of the hold taking her by surprise. But she couldn’t talk just yet because if she went to she’d have to begin breathing again.</p><p>And breathing meant experiencing the heavenly scent once more.</p><p>“Y’know,” the soft voice continued, deeper than Rio would have anticipated, “she was pretty cute. She promised me a good time too, so I hope you’re willing to offer more than that now you’ve scared her away.”</p><p>A laugh escaped Rio’s lips before she could prevent it and she turned easily in the tight hold, careful not to hurt the woman - not yet anyway.</p><p>Up close she was even more beautiful. Rio was maybe an inch taller but this woman appeared head and shoulders above everyone else. Her skin seemed carved from unblemished marble and her lips were painted the colour of blood fresh from a bite. Rio wanted to sink her teeth into them to see if it were an exact match.</p><p>“Oh, baby, you have no idea.”</p><p>The impact was immediate, Rio could practically feel her pupils dilating as her lungs filled again with that intoxicating scent. She stepped in and pressed their bodies flush together, raising a finger to gently tilt the woman’s head and found her to be compliant, obedient even.</p><p>She was already submitting to her.</p><p>But brushing her mane of hair aside she saw what she’d already assumed would be there; a silver shadow of another vampire’s fangs. Her lips twitched even as her stomach lurched with flaming jealousy but she kept her voice low as she traced the pad of her finger slowly over the mark.</p><p>“Tut tut. A regular, I assume? Got any more of those, hermosa?”</p><p>“A few. Would you like to see?”</p><p>The woman leant back, raised her brows and smiled and Rio didn’t move but turned her gaze to her, watching as the smile turned to a smirk. “Ah. You don’t care for sharing?”</p><p>And Rio smirked right back, her fingers still lightly grazing the dimly silver skin of the woman’s bite mark as she took a second to breathe her in so deeply she felt she might faint with it.</p><p>“I’m not usually one for groupies.”</p><p>She turned then, a test, to see what the woman would do. And found that she’d judged it perfectly as her hand was grabbed and in an attempt to get her to turn back, the woman pulled her fingers up to her red lips and began kissing over them.</p><p>Rio did turn and the sight alone was worth it. “Maybe I just haven’t met the person good enough to tame me.”</p><p>Rio smirked as the woman sucked around her fore and middle fingers and watched her cheeks go hollow as she stepped back in and allowed the richness of her blood’s scent to fill her lungs again. “Oh you don’t look like you need much taming.”</p><p>She felt the woman’s teeth graze her fingers and she smiled because of it, catching the blue-eyed gaze that fell to her grin.</p><p>Her fingers were slowly released from the woman’s mouth and Rio looked to the wet slick of saliva on a red lower lip as the woman said: “No fangs? Most like to show off. Too small or too shy?”</p><p>Rio laughed and grinned wider, showing off her fangless mouth.</p><p>She reached down with her spit-covered fingers and slipped her hand beneath the tight red dress the woman was wearing and, hearing no complaint, and already smelling her arousal, she pressed her fingers up to feel the sodden lace of the woman’s underwear.</p><p>“Oh, there’s plenty of time for that.”</p><p>The woman whimpered.</p><p>“So tell me,” Rio said softly, leaning in again to graze her lips across the shell of the woman’s ear as she spoke, “how many,” she pulled the lace aside, felt the rush of the woman’s heated arousal fill her lungs and create a heady concoction of bloodlust and desire within her, “how many vampires,” she stroked her fingers languidly through soaked folds, “have you been with?”</p><p>The woman was now leaning against her, clutching at the leather across Rio’s back, and Rio smirked into her ear as she pushed inside the stranger, finding no resistance whatsoever, hearing her heart rate pick up, and her moaning quietly against her.</p><p>“Enough,” she murmured in that low voice again and Rio turned her head to watch her face as she began to fuck her slowly in the middle of the club.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>“M-maybe,” the woman stuttered as Rio twisted her hand and found her clit, “maybe five.”</p><p>“Mm. And that sounds like a lie.”</p><p>The woman released a breathy laugh and Rio rewarded her by adding a third finger inside of her, curling them inwards slightly to make her moan louder.</p><p>“How many?”</p><p>“I…” and Rio watched as blue eyes rolled back and the woman offered her neck to her. And Rio could have sunk her fangs in, deeper than she would have with anyone else, because this woman smelled better than anyone she’d come across in her three hundred years of this half-life.</p><p>But biting her, biting her now, was not an option.</p><p>If she bit her, she’d kill her. She wouldn’t be able to stop.</p><p>And so Rio pulled her hand away without warning. And the stranger’s reactions were human and so slower than her own and Rio was able to push her fingers into her mouth so suddenly that she gasped around them and bit down.</p><p>It tickled, more than anything.</p><p>And Rio smirked at the sight of dark blue eyes widening as she stared at Rio, but sucked her own juices obediently off of Rio’s fingers.</p><p>Rio’s free arm was wrapped tightly around the woman’s waist and she held her closer than before, indulging in the scent as well as the sight and feel of her.</p><p>When she eventually pulled her fingers out the woman’s hungry mouth she was panting heavily, her hands moving to cup Rio’s jaw as her thumbs brushed her upper lip up to see if she’d yet earned her prize.</p><p>Rio gasped quietly when the pad of the stranger’s thumb brushed along the underside of her teeth, feeling out any sign of her fangs beginning to protrude. It felt strangely more intimate than when Rio was just buried three fingers deep in the brunette, but she allowed it because the sight of the stranger eyeing her so desperately was too good to deny.</p><p>“I’ve never met a vampire who didn’t want to feed off of me.”</p><p>Rio waited until her mouth was clear of thumbs that now hovered near her lips, “Who said I didn't want to feed?”</p><p>The stranger grinned and leant in slowly, and Rio allowed her to ghost her lips over her own, watched curiously as the stranger curled her tongue up to graze her upper lip and then pushed just inside Rio’s open mouth to do the same along the underside of her teeth.</p><p>“You smoke,” the stranger said with a slight furrow in her brow, her blue eyes curious rather than disgusted. “That’s unusual.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>The woman hummed softly, and leant back in again to flicker the tip of her tongue against Rio’s lips once more as if to confirm what she’d just tasted.</p><p>“You can’t half fuck me and not want a little taste,” she whispered as Rio smirked.</p><p>She raised her hand up to the back of a thick head of hair and tilted her head back once more, and dark eyes landed immediately on the evidence that this neck had been drank from before. Rio leant in slowly, enjoying the soft sounds of a heart rate picking up and the soft panted breaths that floated to her ears.</p><p>She pressed her lips to the visible bite and brushed her tongue along the skin there until she was sure of her decision, sure with all the will in the world she wouldn’t be able to stop if she started. So <em>good</em> did this stranger smell, so soft was her supple skin, so <em>willing</em> was she for Rio.</p><p>“Not tonight, cariño,” she breathed out against a firm jaw, releasing her hold on the woman’s hair to let her look back at her.</p><p>She smiled at the confusion on the stranger’s face, at the beginnings of a pout that formed there, at the hands that found her jaw again.</p><p>“I can see you’re hungry, baby. Why else would you be here?”</p><p>The brunette shifted against her and Rio felt her dress being shifted up to reveal more of her thigh as the woman began to rock against her in a steady rhythm, pressing her warm, wet heat against her tight-covered skin. Rio’s hands slid down to grasp the woman’s ass, encouraging this as the woman smirked and released a performative moan.</p><p>“C’mon,” she murmured close enough for Rio to taste her breath against her lips, “Put your fingers and your fangs inside me. You know you want to.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched in an attempt at a smirk but the feel of this woman, the scent of her as she rubbed against her, it made her teeth ache with want and her pussy throb in a way she hadn’t felt in decades.</p><p>Feeding and fucking usually went hand in hand when in a place like this and Rio didn’t need to look up to know they weren’t the only two on the precipice of one or the other - or both. Her needy hands squeezed the woman’s ass firmly, making her buck and moan again.</p><p>Rio caught sight of eyes so black she could see her own need reflected back at her and she decided she could have one thing, just one treat. It was her birthday, how could she deny herself?</p><p>Her hold shifted on the woman and she lifted her with no effort at all, and before the woman could have much of an idea what was happening, her back was colliding with the wall. Rio had held herself back just enough to make sure she didn’t break the fragile body in her arms, but she made sure she felt it.</p><p>Pale legs were wrapped around her waist and the blue-eyed woman was looking at her with wide eyes and a smug smirk, “Gonna bite me, baby? Gonna use me as your personal suck-and-fuck?”</p><p>Rio groaned and dropped her gaze again to the bite mark on the woman’s neck, licking her lips when it was offered up to her once more, fighting the urge to sink her fangs in and feed.</p><p>“I’m going to fuck you,” she husked out, eyes still on the woman’s throat, “and you’ll be grateful.”</p><p>The woman gasped out a moan at her words but Rio didn’t give her time to process them, feeling dizzy with the scent of the woman again. Now no longer in the centre of the busy room, there was little to dilute it. Breathing her in felt like nothing she’d ever felt before.</p><p>It burned her lungs in such exquisite agony and as she pressed her fingers back inside the woman she buried her face against her neck, unable to stop herself from feeling the warm, familiar rush of blood so tantalisingly close to the skin. So deliciously close to her mouth.</p><p>“F-fuck,” was all the woman managed to gasp out as Rio set a brutal pace, holding the woman up against the wall and fucking her openly, gloriously, for anyone with eyes to see.</p><p>“F-fangs,” the brunette murmured as Rio felt her clench around her fingers and she pulled away from the soft cocoon of the crook of her neck, to look at the woman’s desperate face so open and human before her. “Fangs,” she gasped out again, one of her hands clutching at Rio’s jaw as Rio twisted her hand between them and began to bully her clit with rapid movements.</p><p>“P-please!”</p><p>Rio grinned at the sight, the woman looked so desperate, felt so good against her, was so wet for her, her heavy pants and her parted lips, her flushed cheeks and chest and her grabbing hands.</p><p>She relented. She gave her exactly what she wanted.</p><p>She unsheathed her fangs, long and sharp and brilliant white, and bared them for the woman to see. The brunette choked out a moan as her dark eyes honed in on them and Rio felt her clench around her fingers so tightly it was like she was trying to milk them.</p><p>She came beautifully against her, her cried moan so loud and unashamed that Rio almost lost her cool. But she kept fucking her, kept bullying her clit and watching as she the woman’s gaze moved from Rio’s fangs to her eyes.</p><p>The intensity of her stare, the unbidden want in her eyes, it made Rio slow, made her dip her head down to brush her lips and tongue at the woman’s throat, hiding from her sight.</p><p>“F-fuck me, fuck me, bite me. Please! Please, just…”</p><p>And the woman’s hand found the back of Rio’s head and she tried to hold her there, though sheer strength alone would never do it. Rio remained where she was and grinned against the woman’s throat, allowing her to feel the flat of her fangs without piercing her skin.</p><p>It made her moan again, made her try to force Rio’s head down, made her rock her hips for more and Rio laughed as she pulled back with ease and grinned at the woman.</p><p>“So demanding,” she smirked as she pulled her fingers slowly out of her and moved her hold to her ass again, holding her a little closer.</p><p>“So,” the woman tried through a whine, but her heaving chest gave her away and Rio looked down at it, noting the pattern of flushed red across it and allowing her hand to trace a trail of the woman’s sticky wetness over it.</p><p>The woman shuddered, “You’ll fuck me in public but not feed from me? And with <em>such</em> big, beautiful fangs.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up again to the woman’s face and she surveyed her for a second, her tongue grazing the tip of her right fang just to see if the woman would react. Blue eyes dropped to the movement and her face suddenly became desperate and she began to claw at Rio’s jacket, tugging her though Rio remained unmoved.</p><p>“Please,” the woman said with a frown, her eyes briefly darting up to meet Rio’s again, “please give them to me.”</p><p>Rio laughed derisively and noted the way the woman’s gaze didn’t falter, she didn’t even blink at the noise. Interesting.</p><p>“Are you always this desperate?”</p><p>The woman raised her gaze and then leant in slowly, and Rio allowed it to happen. She smelled like molasses warmed by the sun, like peaches and honey, like a rose in its first bloom. And Rio wasn’t just tempted, she was ravenous.</p><p>“Just for you.” The words were breathed out against her lips, that heady scent filling her nostrils and sinking down into her aching throat.</p><p>Rio had no qualms about killing humans. None at all. She had her own moral code and she stuck to it. She didn’t kill unless she needed to, she tried to kill those deserving of it, and she left the vast majority of the population alone.</p><p>Even the girls she took as a treat every decade she often left alive, barely so, but alive all the same. They’d recover after a good sleep. Usually.</p><p>But this woman, this walking temptation, this apotheosis of scent, would surely die at her hands if she allowed herself to taste. And that would be a greater sin than any she’d ever committed; to destroy the thing she could see herself desiring forever.</p><p>“So what is it?” Rio asked quietly, nudging her lips across the woman’s jaw. “Vampires? The strength? The proximity to death?”</p><p>Rio smiled as she turned her head and began to brush her lips down the column of the woman’s throat.</p><p>“It’s the fact that you find me <em>irresistible</em>.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly because <em>oh if she knew</em>.</p><p>The woman hummed and Rio felt the vibrations against her lips, “It’s incredible, being wanted by someone with ultimate power. By someone who could have <em>anyone</em> and they choose <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Rio pulled back to gaze at the woman, her eyes now trained on her lips, her brow arching.</p><p>“The woman I was just with? She scared off three others who tried to take me. And with you,” the woman’s eyes widened a little but remained that strange mix of blue and black, like an ocean with unseen depths, “she didn’t even try.”</p><p>Pale fingers found her jaw again and Rio fought her smirk. “You’re the most powerful vampire in here. I’ve been around enough to know it when I see it.”</p><p>She shifted her hold against her, moving her hands down to the woman’s knees and slowly pressing them open, making the brunette whine quietly as she stretched her thighs open. She did it slowly, giving the woman time to adjust with every inch she pushed, watching her carefully to see if it was too much, and stopped only when her knees were almost flush with the wall she held her up against.</p><p>“You prefer my thigh? Want me to squirt blood for you?” The woman groaned, swallowing so heavily Rio’s eyes darted down to see her throat bob. “If you bite me there you can eat me out with my blood on your tongue. I know some vamps-…”</p><p>But her words were lost because Rio had pushed her knees suddenly flush to the wall, making her cry out and groan as Rio pressed her body closer against her, forcing her legs to remain in the split position.</p><p>“G-god, fuck,” the woman breathed, halfway now between a laugh and a moan, “You don’t play well with others.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and leant in to nudge her nose against the stranger’s jaw, making her head tilt back so deliciously easily for her.</p><p>“What if I,” the stranger began, one arm around Rio’s neck, the other so her hand was buried in her hair, “promise to be yours? No one else can touch me. You can feed whenever you want.”</p><p>Rio was the one to laugh this time and she placed a soft kiss to the crook of the woman’s neck before she pulled back up to grin at her, fangs on full display still, “Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah!” The woman said deliriously, taking Rio’s reaction as an agreement already. She shifted and Rio relaxed her hold, taking her stretched legs and wrapping them back around her waist again. “Yeah! Your own personal bleeder. You can feed and fuck me and I’ll wait for you, just wait for you to need me.”</p><p>Rio hummed, watching in amusement as the blue eyes before her widened and the woman’s hands moved to her jaw again, seeking the feel of the fangs she wouldn’t let her touch. “All for you. Please. I’ll be yours.”</p><p>“You haven’t even felt my bite yet, how do you know it’s-…?”</p><p>The woman’s fingers rested across Rio’s lower lip and Rio stopped talking for fear she’d accidentally slip into one of them.</p><p>“They’re big,” she said quietly, and Rio could tell that she was practically salivating. “My big, beautiful vampire. I want them so desperately. I’ll give you everything, whenever you want it.”</p><p>The woman’s promise settled straight between her thighs and Rio swallowed and pushed the woman’s legs off of her, making her stand up again. The stranger whined and kept herself pressed close but Rio smirked as she painfully and reluctantly retracted her fangs. The look of loss on the woman’s face was immediate and Rio moved her hand up to wrap around her throat, squeezing the sides gently. “Take me home. Now.”</p><p>The stranger nodded eagerly and Rio stepped back to allow her to move. She stumbled on shaking legs, and Rio reached for her waist to hold her steady, guiding her back through the crowds.</p><p>She noticed that the woman she was with drew more attention than the girls she’d taken previously and she wondered if her scent was working it’s magic on more than just her. Everyone had different tastes but delicious was delicious so she tightened her hold on the woman, so much so that she turned to look at her as if expecting her to stop them again, do something, perhaps bite her in the middle of the club.</p><p>But she didn’t. And she didn’t have to wonder for much longer if this woman was manna to anyone else because a figure appeared before them just as they were at the door.</p><p>The woman gasped softly and Rio arched a brow at the vampire daring to get between her and the exit.</p><p>“Leaving already?”</p><p>The stranger nodded and stepped back into Rio’s body, turning her head pliantly to press her face into the side of Rio’s neck. Rio didn’t react to it but knew it to be a sign of submission for her sake as well as the woman now staring hungrily at the brunette pressed back against her.</p><p>She’d been right before, this woman was no idiot.</p><p>“Agatha,” the other vamp said, her tone shifting to something sickeningly sweet, “but we always have such a good time.”</p><p><em>Agatha.</em></p><p>The name sounded older than Rio had expected, but the syllables rolled around her mind in a way that made her want to roll them around on her tongue, swirl them in Agatha’s pussy. And the Agatha in question turned fully from her name spoken from the lips of the blonde woman with her fangs beared, turned so her pale arms slipped around Rio’s waist below her jacket, and she hid herself still against Rio’s neck.</p><p>It was beautiful, how submissive she was and when Rio hadn’t even said anything. She’d made good already on her promise to be Rio’s alone and Rio felt her fangs ache again for wont of breaching her gums, for her desire to be buried deep in the woman so compliant for her already.</p><p>“I’m not sure she wants you,” she said calmly, feeling Agatha press her face in a little closer.</p><p>“Oh, she does. She’s just playing a silly game we like to play. Give her to me.”</p><p>Rio laughed even as she felt Agatha’s hold tighten around her and the blonde stepped closer to them, “There are plenty more bleeders to choose from.”</p><p>“But I want this one.”</p><p>“Oh, but she’s mine. Can’t you see that?”</p><p>Rio reached down to the hem of Agatha’s dress and peeled it slowly upwards, and felt Agatha whimper against her as she glanced down to her pale ass now exposed for the other vampire to see.</p><p>The blonde glanced at it and Rio grinned at her, moving her hands to caress over Agatha’s ass, taking the time to feel over it, to watch with fascination as the vampire opposite them just stared, just watched Rio’s hands as they groped the human between them.</p><p>Had she ever been this weak? This pathetic?</p><p>Agatha didn’t react, didn’t even flinch when Rio’s hold became firm and she pulled open her ass cheeks to expose her more, proving to the club that this woman in her arms was hers to do with as she pleased. She reluctantly moved her hands to rest on Agatha’s hips and the woman stayed still against her.</p><p>“Agatha?” She asked calmly, feeling a jolt of delight shoot through her now she could speak the woman’s name. “Spread your legs for me, cariño.”</p><p>Agatha did, without hesitation, she spread them two shoulder widths apart, shortening her height an inch or two as she now stared up at Rio, her eyes wide and desperate. And Rio looked down at her, moving her hands to cup her cheeks as she proudly showed off the control she already had on the woman.</p><p>Her dark eyes flickered slowly back up to the blonde vampire still staring, unable to settle her gaze as it flickered between Agatha’s ass and Rio’s smug face. Agatha trembled against her but Rio kept her eyes on the blonde.</p><p>“It’s pretty clear she’s mine, friend. But be my guest, tell her to come to you. See if that works out.”</p><p>She dropped her hold on Agatha’s face, glanced down at her only briefly, and stepped away, easily breaking out of Agatha’s hold.</p><p>The brunette continued to tremble where she stood, her ass exposed and her legs still spread, her eyes only on Rio.</p><p>But Rio was watching the vampire, focusing on the fangs she kept visible, the dominate way she held her head up, the arch of her brow as she said in a firm voice, the opposite of Rio’s tenderly whispered earlier instructions: “Agatha, come here to me.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move, only released a soft whimper, and Rio smirked as the blonde began to shake with fury, her hand held out behind Agatha’s back now, her voice rising. “Agatha. Now.”</p><p>And Rio laughed because Agatha hadn’t even flinched but remained where she was.</p><p>A show like this, a game played at the expense of a human, for the sake of humiliating a fellow feeder wasn’t exactly commonplace for Rio. But this Agatha, this woman whose blood smelled so good and whose desire was currently glistening on her pale thighs, being willing to submit to Rio so readily, made it worth it.</p><p>Rio considered for a second, intrigued by how far she could push Agatha and how far the blonde would go before she snapped. But Rio was older than most here, she was stronger too, and she knew the vampire opposite her knew that just by looking at her, just as Agatha had.</p><p>Besides, they’d already wasted enough time.</p><p>Rio stepped back into her and pressed a proud kiss to her temple as she reached to pull her dress back down and then lifted her back up to stand tall against her again.</p><p>“She’s made her choice. So I suggest you back off before I choose <em>your</em> throat instead.”</p><p>Rio peeled Agatha off of her, breaking the hold that had returned the second she’d stepped closer again. She took her hand as she barged past the blonde without looking back, ensuring Agatha was on the other side of her and her hand was wrapped firmly around her paler one.</p><p>They made it outside and Rio was only a little relieved they hadn’t been followed. Part of her wanted the thrill of a kill in front of Agatha. She wanted to see how she’d react to her ripping someone’s throat out before her. Surely she’d be on her knees for her before her victim even hit the floor.</p><p>There was time for that, maybe. Time to show Agatha off more when she’d solved her little problem of wanting to devour her so totally. She turned to glance at Agatha before she shrugged off her jacket and draped it around her shoulders.</p><p>“So submissive,” she muttered, helping Agatha to slip her arms into the jacket properly, noticing a silver bite shine at her under the street lamp across a pale bicep.</p><p>“Usually people like you like that sort of thing,” Agatha said with a smirk, moving back closer now she properly wore Rio’s jacket. “Makes you look more powerful than you already are, didn’t you like it?”</p><p>She leant up and captured Rio’s lower lip in her teeth which made Rio gasp at the sudden delicious proximity, at the taste so close to being on her tongue.</p><p>“I’d have liked it much more if I could have fucked you right in front of her,” she uttered as Agatha released her lip and smiled up at her.</p><p>“We can go back in and you can do just that?”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, half a mind to do it, but she knew a club full of feeders wasn’t the place she wanted to devour this woman.</p><p>“No. We’re going back to yours.”</p><p>Rio pulled away but took Agatha’s hand, motioning with her head for her to lead the way. They walked silently down the deserted street and Rio became aware that in every alley they passed there was a fresh spill of blood. She breathed it in, and felt a fresh sense of smugness as they passed each one. Because her girl smelt better, and when Agatha’s blood was spilled, it would be a delicacy to be savoured rather than a hurried meal in a dark alley.</p><p>As they reached the end of the street and the traffic picked up Agatha leant out to hail a cab. “It’s quicker,” she explained as Rio raised her brows and slid in to the arrived cab before her.</p><p>Agatha climbed in and settled on Rio’s lap without asking, leaning forwards into the glass partition to give her address and pressing her ass back against Rio in a move that Rio knew was on purpose.</p><p>She didn’t acknowledge it but as Agatha settled back against her she began to peel her dress up slowly, hearing the subtle hitch of Agatha’s breath as she did.</p><p>“Agatha? That’s an old name, isn’t it?”</p><p>“You really want to talk about old?”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, her attention down now between them where she could see Agatha’s pale ass and the black lace of her underwear.</p><p>“How old are you?”</p><p>“Old enough.”</p><p>Rio hummed and easily snapped the fabric of her panties with one hand, making Agatha jump a little.</p><p>“How old are you?”</p><p>Rio shrugged as she slid the fabric out from underneath the woman, and reached around her to hold it out to her. “Mouth,” she said quietly, pressing a delicate kiss to Agatha’s arm through her leather jacket.</p><p>“I’m old enough too,” she uttered a little louder as she leant around Agatha and watched her turn her head, her cheeks a little flushed as she balled up the small amount of fabric and placed it obediently in her mouth.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio grinned, turning Agatha so she could sit sideways on her lap now and she could enjoy the view of her obedient little birthday treat.</p><p>“Now,” she whispered softly, pushing her hand slowly up Agatha’s inner thigh and watching her squirm a little where she sat. “When we get in, we’ll continue where we left off in the club, okay? But I’m not going to give you what you want tonight.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha frowned above her, turning her body more towards Rio just as her fingers came into contact with her clit. Agatha jolted, made a soft noise and Rio grinned, keeping her fangs hidden from view as she began to draw teasingly soft circles over the swollen bundle of nerves.</p><p>Rio made sure to pull her fingers away any time she could see Agatha getting close and she kept her touches feather light, teasing rather than exacting. Agatha was clutching at her now, her eyes fluttering closed, her heart rate thunderous in Rio’s ears, and the mixture of her blood and her arousal causing Rio to almost lose her willpower and sink her teeth into her willing neck.</p><p>The cab came to a halt just as Rio thought she would lose it and her hand flew from Agatha before she could protest. She reached into her jacket pocket and removed a wad of cash to fling at the driver before she opened the door and carried Agatha out, placing her down on the sidewalk and pulling her dress down to cover her again.</p><p>Agatha still carried her panties in her mouth and Rio saw to her delight that she’d drooled a little around them, a combination of being close to orgasm and the pain of keeping a wad of soiled fabric in her mouth for so long.</p><p>Rio leant in and licked it from her chin, groaning quietly at the taste of it, her gums reacting before she could stop them. Her fangs were down again and Agatha caught them this time, her eyes wide and her hands reaching until Rio stopped them, turned Agatha sharply and sent her to the door with a hard smack on her ass.</p><p>The woman made a muffled yelp noise but pushed the door open to let Rio into the apartment complex. When in the tiny elevator, Agatha pressed against her the same way she had in the club, offering her obedience without being asked.</p><p>This time, Rio held her.</p><p>When they reached Agatha’s floor, Agatha let them in with a key from under the mat and Rio raised her brows at this but said nothing. Agatha moved them through the small but cosy apartment to the bedroom where she turned to Rio expectantly and Rio stepped closer to shed Agatha of her jacket, to rip the bandeau dress from her body, and to pull the ripped panties from her mouth.</p><p>Agatha gasped when her mouth was empty again and she panted heavily as she waited for Rio to make her next move, “Can I have them now? Please? I’ll be so good for you. I <em>have</em> been so good for you.”</p><p>Rio stepped in, taking the time to admire Agatha’s body, the flush of blood raised to the surface across her chest, the curve of her stomach, the small, perfect pale breasts.</p><p>Littered across her were the evidence of Agatha’s desires. On her bicep, her throat, over her ribs, between both thighs, she had the silvery outlines of bites on her. And Rio touched each with the fingers that had been inside Agatha.</p><p>She silently traced each outline with a kind of reverence, a horrid, evil competitiveness rising in her at the knowledge that vamps before her had been able to bite this woman and leave her alive when she still wouldn’t dare.</p><p>“I’m going to fuck you,” she said softly, her voice low as she raised her gaze again, “and then I’m going to come back tomorrow and fuck you again.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered quietly, moving her hands to hold Rio’s jaw, “And feed?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why? I promise I taste good. I promise I’ll be good enough, I’ll be worthy of-…” and she whimpered because Rio had pressed a finger inside of her.</p><p>“If I bite you now I’ll kill you, hermosa.”</p><p>“Suck me,” Agatha groaned quietly when Rio pressed a second finger inside of her, “Suck me dry… I don’t,” she moaned, “please. Take it all.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed and Agatha only moaned loudly, her left hand now curling around Rio’s lower teeth, trying to force her to bite, “Please.”</p><p>“You smell too good.” Rio said only when she’d forcibly pulled her head away. “This whole fucking place <em>reeks</em> of you. If I sink my fangs into you I’ll-…”</p><p>Agatha whimpered and rocked her hips and Rio pulled out of her, bending slightly to lift her easily and throw her back onto the bed.</p><p>She crawled over her and growled when Agatha exposed her throat to her, the woman’s hands seeking Rio’s waist to try and hold her there - as if she ever could. But Rio pressed her face into Agatha’s neck, allowing herself to open her mouth fully against her, for her fangs to release again and press their sharp tips against the skin that was screaming to be broken.</p><p>She pulled away only because she wanted to savour it, when she tasted her. She couldn’t just devour something so precious.</p><p>“Fuck, please,” the woman whined, groaning below her as Rio moved to sit back, straddling Agatha’s hips, “I need you inside me, in every way. I’m so desperate, <em>please</em>.”</p><p>Rio licked her lips and saw Agatha’s gaze drop to them, saw the neediness in her eyes, felt the way she clawed at her thighs, and she shifted, moved to lay over her again, moved to enter her once more, not allowing her to adjust as she fucked her more harshly than she had earlier.</p><p>She allowed her to moan and writhe and scratch at her and made her come so hard she pierced her own skin on her lower lip.</p><p>Rio’s hand stilled without warning and she pulled away, looking down with suddenly blood red eyes at the beautiful drop of blood that matched perfectly the stain of lipstick over Agatha’s swollen lips.</p><p>“Take it,” Agatha gasped quietly, reaching her chin up to offer it to Rio who stared at it soundlessly. “Just one drop, I know you want it. Just one, please. Taste me.”</p><p>Rio pulled back slowly, resting back on her ankles again as Agatha forced herself onto her elbows though she shook with the effort of it.</p><p>“I want to bleed for you,” Agatha said huskily, making Rio’s eyes snap up to deep blue. “Let me bleed for you.”</p><p>Rio pulled off of her completely then, stepping from the bed entirely.</p><p>She took a deep breath but found it made the aching in her chest worse because there was nothing to breathe here except the scent of the woman waiting for her on the bed.</p><p>“If you come back tomorrow, you can have me however you want me. I’ll wait for you. Naked. Desperate. Wake me with your fingers or your tongue or your fangs. Let me know how much you want me. And then bleed me dry.”</p><p>Rio swallowed at the woman’s words, wondering how it was that she had such a hold on her already. It wasn’t just her blood she wanted. She wanted to hear her submit over and over again. She wanted to press her face into her neck and hear Agatha beg for more even as she took all she could.</p><p>But, then, another sound from Agatha’s lips took her by surprise, a whimper as she spoke: “Don’t feed from anyone else tonight. Please. Just me.”</p><p>Rio’s blood red, hungry eyes moved from where they’d been focused on Agatha’s pale throat and landed on bright blue eyes. “You’re making demands?”</p><p>“I…” Agatha started slowly as Rio moved back to her, standing over her beside the bed where she lay, “I don’t want you to taste anyone else.”</p><p>“I’m a vampire, Agatha. I f-…”</p><p>“Then feed from <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Rio released a laugh because a human hadn’t interrupted her in centuries. And this one, this pale beauty, naked and vulnerable before her was not only interrupting her but demanding she not do the one thing she was built to do.</p><p>But she’d already established that Agatha had no shame and wasn’t affected by Rio’s laughter. “I know you want me as much as I want you.”</p><p>Rio began to salivate because Agatha had moved before her, was sitting in front of her with her knees up and her legs spread. She watched as she dipped her fingers into herself, fucking herself slowly for Rio to see.</p><p>Rio’s hands flexed as if she were to stop her, or help her, or add her fingers to Agatha’s cunt just to hear her scream.</p><p>But Agatha was already pulling out, and moved her wet fingers up to her throat where she trailed the slick around the silvery bite mark already there. Rio had never wanted someone so badly, never been left in her want, unable to simply take.</p><p>And this Agatha knew exactly what she was doing, exactly how to drive Rio to the brink of madness.</p><p>So Rio moved over her, pressed her knees down until they were flat against the bed and Agatha was moaning as her pussy was stretched open, and Rio could see exactly how badly she wanted her. Rio spat, watching her saliva trickle slowly from around Agatha’s clit towards her greedy hole.</p><p>Agatha whined and Rio couldn’t keep her eyes off of the place she wanted to bury herself, wondering how much Agatha could take before she told her no.</p><p>She swallowed thickly, dragging her dark gaze slowly up to meet Agatha’s desperate gaze.</p><p>“I’m going to feed on some other slut who wants me. And when I’m full of her I’m going to come back here and feed from you.”</p><p>“N-no,” Agatha groaned, trying desperately to move, pushing her upper half up towards Rio, “Ah! Fuck. Please. Just feed from me. If you kill me-…”</p><p>“Cariño, if I kill you I won’t be able to taste you again. You’re willing to risk experiencing this only once? You promised me you’d be mine, I took that to mean forever.”</p><p>“Y-yes,” Agatha whined, “Yes, forever. Please.”</p><p>Rio smirked a little, releasing her hold on Agatha’s knees without warning and watching her groan and then scramble to try and get to her before she left again. Rio allowed this, watching the woman shuffle to her, the pain and desperation evident on her face as she grabbed at the front of Rio’s dress. “Don’t fuck them. Just feed. Quickly. Then come back.”</p><p>Rio smiled and then disappeared before Agatha could blink, and as she stepped out into the night again she breathed in air unpolluted by Agatha’s intoxicating scent and felt her body relax once more. She chose to walk back to the club, to take the time to breathe without the fear she’d destroy the best thing she’d ever come across.</p><p>But once back there, breathing in the scent of those lesser beings, she could barely bring herself to do what she came here to do. She stalked the dance floor, seeking out someone, anyone who might match up to the feeling of Agatha filling her lungs. But no one came close.</p><p>She eventually found a human who didn’t make her stomach lurch and she pressed against her from behind, burying her face in dark hair to get closer to her true scent. It was woody, warm, a scent that would have before been enough, but now wasn’t anything at all.</p><p>A quick fix before she buried her fangs in Agatha was what she needed to ensure she wouldn’t lose control and take too much. From a human she usually took enough to satisfy, to quell the ache in her throat. If they tasted rancid she’d only take enough to get her to the next victim.</p><p>If they were of a higher calibre she’d relish and stop only when she felt full - often leaving the human clinging to the sides of life. But Agatha was different. Agatha’s blood, even protected by her soft skin, made Rio feel feral, made her worst, least human instincts flare to such a degree that her preternatural desire made her want to destroy the temptation - to rid the world of it and jealously devour her so no one else could have her.</p><p>But Rio considered herself to be better than her kin, and a glimmer of the human she once was made her bury her face into this woman’s neck, made her inhale the inoffensive scent currently filling her lungs. Feasting on another would mean her thirst was lessened, that she could control her animal instincts to destroy the thing that so tempted her.</p><p>But as her fangs dropped, as they pressed into the warm skin of the woman pressed back against her and she felt her moan, Rio found herself unable to do the thing she was built for.</p><p>But it was too late. Her sharp elongated canines pierced the woman’s skin without Rio even trying and she felt a rush of adrenaline as the first drops of warm blood hit her tongue and without thinking she sank her fangs deeper in to taste more.</p><p>The sound of another soft moan filled her ears and the cadence of it, the pitch, it made her pull back. With a mouth full of blood and her hands full of wanting flesh, she stepped fully away. The woman turned to her and for the first time Rio saw that her eyes were a soft blue, her jaw was softer still, and she was nothing compared to the woman she’d left waiting for her.</p><p>The woman looked confused, and grabbed at Rio as Rio leant in and sealed the bite over, dribbling warm blood down the woman’s neck as she did so.</p><p>But she turned from her without a word and pushed through the writhing bodies to the safety of the outside world. Beyond the door she spat out the last of the stranger’s blood and wiped her mouth on her arm.</p><p>Nearby she heard the sounds of feasting and knew it to be a joint effort rather than a much more dignified one on one scenario. The part of her that had flared up with her fangs in the woman didn’t flare this time and Rio Vidal stalked away from the sounds of a violent banquet to return to the woman whose life teetered on the edges of Rio’s humanity.</p><p>She walked slowly back to her apartment, using the journey this time to think over how she could resist doing as Agatha had instructed and sucking her dry. To never have her burn her lungs again, to never feel the woman’s submission, to never get to bend her over in a room full of people who wanted her and to fuck her in front of them and have Agatha beg for it, she would deprive herself of all of this if she killed her.</p><p>Then there was the softness of her touches, the flicker in her eyes of something Rio hadn’t experienced in centuries. The signs of her humanity that sparked a memory of her own.</p><p>She snuck into her apartment through the window, six floors and seven windows along.</p><p>The window had been left ajar and Rio knew it hadn’t been earlier, because the scent of Agatha in that little room had been too much, too stifling.</p><p>She’d opened it for her.</p><p>She climbed in silently, leaving a little gap below the window as she closed it again to give herself a taste of the fresh air she might need to keep herself steady.</p><p>But as she turned to see Agatha she felt ravenous again. Her scent burned at her, the pain so delicious, she could have fallen to her knees for it.</p><p>Agatha was lying on the bed, starfished across it, fast asleep. Her two ankles had been tied with purple ropes to the foot of the bed and her right arm was above her head, tied too with rope, her left splayed by her side, rope around it but unattached.</p><p>But the best, most beautiful thing about this little scene, was the note Agatha had left for Rio across her skin. There, in lipstick the shade of blood, she’d written across her abdomen:</p><p><strong>SUCK<br/>
ME<br/>
FUCK<br/>
ME</strong></p><p>Agatha, her beautiful little biddable bleeder, had tied herself up in the hope that Rio would come back to her.</p><p>Rio moved closer, watching carefully to see if Agatha would wake. But the sounds of her heavy breathing, the soft rhythm of her heart, the slack in her face, it told her everything she needed to know.</p><p>In the time Rio had been gone, Agatha had arranged this little scene for her, displayed herself so beautifully, been so obedient even when Rio wasn’t there. It was almost too much to handle.</p><p>But as her eyes hungrily roamed every inch of Agatha’s body, she saw something off to the side that caught her eye. A harness and a large purple dildo rested by Agatha’s hip.</p><p>Rio leant across to it, it felt tacky to the touch, and Rio’s eyes dropped to Agatha’s exposed pussy and saw it looked deliciously pink, that her juices covered her thighs, that she’d clearly fucked herself with this in Rio’s absence.</p><p>“Good girl,” she muttered under her breath, reaching down to silently remove her boots at the end of the bed.</p><p>She stripped easily, making no noise at all, and then moved to take the harness up and attach it to her hips. She could feel its weight, and gaged the size to be too large for her to enjoy fully without waking Agatha. But there was still fun to be had. To trust anyone with <em>that</em> whilst asleep, let alone a vampire with strength enough to literally rip her in half with it, was brave beyond measure.</p><p>But from what Rio had seen of Agatha so far, what she’d taken, and how she’d begged, she knew she could handle it. She settled herself carefully on the bed between Agatha’s legs and raised her gaze to check the sleeping woman one last time.</p><p>Lowering herself closer to where she wanted to bury herself, Agatha’s scent became much thicker, heavier in her nostrils, no longer burning the back of her throat but coating it instead.</p><p>It almost choked her, her desire to devour almost too strong to ignore. But this woman was her gift, she had to treat her as such; she had to savour her whilst she had her.</p><p>She leant in slowly, using two fingers to carefully part Agatha’s swollen lips so she could seek out her clit. She blew out a cool breath against her exposed pussy and when Agatha didn’t react she allowed her tongue to brush out and taste her for the first time.</p><p>Her eyes coloured red again and her fangs appeared before she could stop them. But she lapped slowly, cautiously, and by the fifth time the tip of her tongue had grazed Agatha’s clit the woman above her released a soft breath.</p><p>Her heart rate was still slow, she was still asleep. So Rio closed her eyes and dipped her tongue down, allowing it to swirl hungrily through Agatha’s pussy, circling gently around her needy hole as the woman’s soft breaths picked up a little.</p><p>Rio pulled back, swallowing down the taste of Agatha desperately, needing more of her, needing her so insanely she couldn’t think of anything else. She looked up to see Agatha’s eyes still closed, her heart rate slow but faster than before and she experimentally pushed two fingers inside of her, meeting no resistance but seeing a slight stirring of her hips that told her she wasn’t far from waking.</p><p>There was something so delicious to Rio about being allowed this, about being told she could play and tease and <em>taste</em> and fuck whilst Agatha was unconscious.</p><p>She curled her fingers slowly inside of her, brushing her thumb now in slow circles over her clit. Agatha released a soft moan and so Rio stopped, pulled out of her.</p><p>She adjusted herself back a little, and gathered Agatha’s own wetness against her hand to rub it over her strap, adding her spit to the mix, lubing it for the sake of keeping Agatha asleep whilst she used her but knowing she’d take her easily with how wet and hungry for her she already was.</p><p>She positioned herself at Agatha’s entrance and breathed in deeply to fill her lungs with Agatha as she pressed her mushroom-shaped tip inside. It took everything in her not to moan loudly at the sight.</p><p>Agatha took her so readily, so hungrily, and Rio pressed further in until she was buried to the hilt against her, and her hand came to rest gently against her abdomen, her fingers grazing the lipstick stains as her thumb brushed idly across Agatha’s clit and she pulled slowly out again.</p><p>Agatha was stirring more below her, her body waking now to the fullness of Rio’s cock inside of her, of the soft ministrations against her clit, of the feel of another person on the bed with her.</p><p>And Rio knew it wouldn’t be long until Agatha was fully cognisant so she took the opportunity to pull slowly out until it was just the tip, resting against Agatha’s gaping, needy hole.</p><p>She pressed a little harder on her clit now, wanting to hasten her waking and unwilling to wait for it.</p><p>Agatha shifted and groaned and just as she turned her head and blinked down at Rio, she snapped her hips up and thrust back into her with such power that Agatha yelled and arched up at the pain of it.</p><p>Rio remained buried inside her, no longer easing the strength by bullying her clit but instead running her nails down Agatha’s abdomen as she panted and whined, half-confused, half-out of her mind with lust.</p><p>“F-fuck, please…”</p><p>“Please, what?”</p><p>Rio kept her hips still, watching the woman groan and pant, unable to do much more as she looked desperately at Rio and whined quietly, “Please, daddy. Fuck me, <em>bite</em> me.”</p><p>Rio grinned and pulled her hips back, sliding easily out of Agatha entirely and making her groan with the loss of her. She moved up to rest over her body, smirking at the sight of her confused face, “I take it this message was for me?”</p><p>“Mmhm. Always for you.”</p><p>“Always?”</p><p>“Y-yes, please. Yours.”</p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” Rio said calmly, glancing down between them to see how far up the strap rested along Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>“I’m going to fuck you until I come, and as soon as I do I’m going to feed.”</p><p>Agatha whined but nodded, stirring below her as her right hand tugged at the rope to try and get closer and her left moved to brush at Rio’s hair, trying for a better view of her fangs, “Will you stay in me?”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and Agatha moved her free hand down to Rio’s hip as if it would encourage her to move it.</p><p>“Your cock o-or your fingers, whatever you want… anything, anything, please.”</p><p>Rio nodded and ducked her head down slowly, cautiously taking a second to press her lips to Agatha’s. The move took them both by surprise because the kiss was so soft, and Rio hadn’t kissed anyone like this in decades.</p><p>But Agatha responded to it, leaning up to keep it going for as long as possible. Only Rio broke it and she moved to crawl up Agatha’s body to take her hand and reach to attach the rope to the bedpost.</p><p>She felt movement below her and turned to see her cock had landed just across Agatha’s mouth and she had opened her lips to it, was sucking over the tip obediently, her eyes on Rio as she did. Rio moved away without a word and Agatha groaned at the loss, now completely at Rio’s mercy on the bed with all four limbs tied to each bedpost.</p><p>“You want me to suck on your pretty throat, cariño?”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>“Suck daddy’s cock and I might.”</p><p>Rio moved then, settling behind Agatha’s head and watching as Agatha tilted her head back and opened her mouth with her tongue sticking out, waiting dutifully for Rio to slide her cock in. She groaned softly as she did, levering herself over Agatha to 69 her and this time she allowed herself to bury her face fully in Agatha’s pussy.</p><p>For the first time in her life, in her half-life, Rio worshipped. She pressed the flat of her tongue through Agatha’s pussy and nuzzled her nose into her, pressing the tip into her entrance as she did everything in her power to prevent her fangs for taking what they so desired.</p><p>Rio was moaning, part from the taste of Agatha, and part from the exquisite delight of being closer to getting what she’d wanted since she’d first inhaled this woman’s scent.</p><p>Agatha was breathing raggedly, at times it sounded like she couldn’t breathe at all, but she was also moaning, also rocking her hips up to Rio’s hungry mouth and so Rio let her choke on it, let her show her how much she wanted it.</p><p>Agatha tasted better than she’d imagined and Rio knew the moment she finally tasted her blood she’d be hooked. This woman was addictive. Her pussy was the gateway drug, her scent the gift that kept on giving.</p><p>A noise behind her told her that Agatha was choking for real, that her airway was blocked, and she pulled away, lifting her hips to sit behind her head again so she could breathe. The sounds of her choking were almost too good to halt but it wouldn’t do to kill the woman before she could taste her properly.</p><p>Agatha before her was panting heavily, her face almost purple with effort, her brow furrowed as she stared up at Rio, “I… wasn’t… done…”</p><p>Rio grinned, exposing her fangs completely as she moved back to straddle Agatha’s hips and reached to caress her throat, helping her to ease down from her choking. “Got a death wish, niña?”</p><p>“Only if,” Agatha breathed heavily, her voice catching in her throat, “you provide it.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and leant back over Agatha, watching her as she slowly caught her breath and her face faded back to its usual flush, “You already taste so fuckin’ good, sweetheart. If I killed you I’d not get to taste you again.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered and tugged at her ropes, “You haven’t tasted me properly.”</p><p>“I also haven’t fucked you properly yet.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly as Agatha groaned and she reached down between them to line herself again and watched with interest as she speared herself totally inside of Agatha and the woman yelled and arched into her, moaning loudly as she did.</p><p>“You take me so well, cariño.”</p><p>Agatha was straining against the ropes, her wrists twisted so she could grip them. And Rio almost lost it when Agatha arched up so beautifully that her neck rolled back and exposed the tight tendon that Rio wanted so desperately to bite.</p><p>But she needed to come first. She needed to fuck her orgasm out of her system or the moment she sunk her teeth into Agatha she’d lose all control and lose this woman forever.</p><p>She began to moan as she rocked her hips, using the rhythm to rub herself against the grinding pad, “Want me to break you in half, baby?”</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t able to respond anymore, so hard was Rio fucking her that every attempt at speech came out in indecipherable babble.</p><p>So Rio fucked her harder, her hand finding her throat and squeezing until she saw Agatha’s eyes bulge and felt the blood pool beneath her hands.</p><p>If she dug her nails in she could make her bleed, she could watch the blood drip over her fingers as she fucked her, then use them to press inside Agatha later when she drank. She wanted to paint her with her own blood then suck it from her skin when she was done with her. The thought alone almost made her come on the spot.</p><p>She released her hold on the woman’s throat only when it felt like Agatha might faint and watched with blood red eyes as she spluttered her moans now, gasping for air.</p><p>Rio whined as she remained buried inside of Agatha but pressed deeper and deeper with every rock of her hips, never giving Agatha time to adjust, and taking everything she could as her thrusting became rutting and she came with one last furious thrust of her hips into Agatha, making the woman arch into her and yell.</p><p>“Fuck!” Rio orgasm hit harder than she expected and it took everything in her to not tear this woman in two with it.</p><p>She began to whine, her eyes wide as she looked down at Agatha as saw her breathless and gaping up at her. But Rio was still rutting, still moving inside of Agatha, desperate to chase more, to take more from her.</p><p>Rio buried her face into Agatha’s neck, and without thinking, without seeing, she finally sunk her fangs into the willing column of her pale throat. Her hips stirred still, chasing the high she’d already hit, and as the warm brick red liquid pooled into her hungry mouth.</p><p>Agatha beneath her was moaning, her body unable to remain still, though Rio’s own above her and the ropes she’d tied herself prevented her from moving too much. Her moaning became a pulse for Rio’s hips as they grinded slowly into Agatha still, and she sucked heavily on her neck.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha managed to breathe out, her first word since Rio had started to fuck her, “F-fuck… fuck,” and Rio heard her heart rate stutter and her breathing falter as she came on her cock still buried to the hilt inside of her.</p><p>Agatha whined with the pain of it as she clenched around Rio but the fangs in her throat gave her what she needed for the pain to dissolve back to pleasure and Rio pulled out enough to rock back, press in again, her thrusts still slow and shallow with every one of Agatha’s moans.</p><p>The blood gushing from Agatha into Rio’s desperate mouth turned off everything in her brain. It was overwhelming, and Rio had never felt hungrier for someone in her life. She sucked harshly, needing to taste as much as she could, heavier and faster, and soon Agatha’s moaning was reduced to whimpers and the trembling body beneath her began to still, quivering only every few seconds.</p><p>Rio had the sense to stretch and pull out of Agatha but couldn’t detach her lips from her throat as she did. “N-no,” Agatha whimpered, her voice husky and soft, and Rio felt her strain her wrists, as if she could break her holds.</p><p>But she ignored her plea, focusing on two things now, her thirst that seemed unquenchable and the slowing heart rate of the woman beneath her. Rio knew if she kept going at the rate she was, Agatha’s heart would stop in mere minutes.</p><p>She wrestled with it; the doldrums of a slowing heartbeat counting down the time she had left to feel the euphoria of drinking down something so delectable that it just had to have been made exclusively for <em>her</em>.</p><p>But Agatha had taken to murmuring, her words inaudible, not because they were so soft, but because she was on the very edges of life now. Her head rolled over, a soft, warm pressure against Rio’s as she continued to feed. Her quivering stopped, her warm body now frozen in time as Rio awakened to the truth of the matter.</p><p>She was losing her.</p><p>Rio pulled back, blinking down at the mess she’d made of Agatha’s delicate throat. She’d been too hungry to be neat about it, too incensed with desire to go slow.</p><p>And now, her stomach was full but her mouth - coated in Agatha’s offering - felt dry. The woman below her was unconscious, her heart rate dangerously slow. Rio leant in again to seal her bite, to clean her throat with her tongue, lapping up every last drop of the gift she’d jealousy destroyed with a tenderness she didn’t know she could possess.</p><p>She moved then with a care she’d not shown earlier to untie the limbs that had been frozen in place for her own enjoyment. She brushed her lips over each wrist, seeing the red marks on them and wanting to ease Agatha’s suffering for them, even if she couldn’t now feel it.</p><p>She did the same with each ankle then gathered her legs together gently so Agatha lay as if in state, straight and neat in the middle of the bed.</p><p>Rio removed her harness, and hovered above her, her hand reaching to press above where her heart would be. She pressed in but barely felt the response of it, and remained steady for a while, listening and waiting.</p><p>This wasn’t something she was used to. She never stayed with a victim if she’d taken as much as she just had from Agatha from them. She would leave them, maybe tuck them away somewhere comfortable first, but she’d never wait, she’d never <em>hope</em>.</p><p>But with Agatha’s taste still on her tongue, and the meekness of her heartbeat in her ears she pulled the blankets over the both of them and curled into the cool body beside her.</p><p>Her face pressed in against Agatha’s neck and she wrapped as close as she could around her. Before she even knew what she was doing she was cradling Agatha, willing her feeble body to recover in her hold.</p><p>For hours Rio held Agatha, warm now under the soft blankets and comfortable as she shared a bed with a woman she barely knew but had almost destroyed. Her hand rested across pale ribs to feel the heart that for so long refused to strengthen. Time could only make it louder, firmer in its rhythm beneath Rio’s palm.</p><p>And Agatha eventually stirred, shivering even beneath the warm cocoon Rio had made for them beneath the sheets.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asked only when she felt her breathing pick up enough that waking was possible.</p><p>The woman groaned quietly, and Rio could read the hoarseness in it as she turned her head slowly towards the vampire sharing her bed. Rio’s eyes, now back to their usual dark brown speckled with gold, watched curiously as Agatha’s lips twitched at the sides.</p><p>“Whatsname?” She whispered into the silence, as Rio’s hand curled around the side of her ribs and she breathed in the scent of Agatha again - after having held her breath for an unknown amount of hours - so deeply that it burned once more.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Agatha made a noise from deep within her throat and Rio leant in to brush her nose against Agatha’s warming cheek, listening intently to her heart rate.</p><p>“Rio,” the woman repeated softly, the flicker back across her lips even as she kept her eyes closed, “That all y’got, Rio?”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, shifting to hover above Agatha now, waiting patiently until she could again see blue eyes as they slowly blinked open for her. Agatha was pale still, on the edges of consciousness as she tried and failed to keep her eyes open, her arms still down at her sides where they were still too heavy to be lifted.</p><p>But Rio could be patient, she could wait, she could give her time.</p><p>“When you’re fully recovered, cariño, I’m going to take you again, okay?”</p><p>Agatha made that soft noise from her throat once more and Rio lowered herself just a little to be closer without resting her full weight on the delicate human below her.</p><p>“Mm’kay,” Agatha murmured, and Rio could tell she was already half-asleep once more.</p><p>She rolled over again to pull Agatha into her side as the woman whispered a final word before she drifted off: “Yours.”</p>
