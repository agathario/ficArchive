<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal had always prided herself on being a polite member of high society. She followed the natural order of things, just as her parents taught her, and her Aunt Lilia once she was orphaned. Rio liked structure. She liked the rules that were made to be followed, no matter how arbitrary. Rio saw value in playing the game of life <i>correctly</i>.</p><p>Which is why when Alice Wu-Gulliver, one of her best friends, spoke about <i>how</i> exactly she was curing her hysteria, Rio could hardly believe it. “And you are…in the <i>nude</i>?” Rio questioned once more, whispering the last few words.</p><p>“She is a doctor,” Alice replied with a shrug. “It is strictly medicinal in nature. I don’t feel as though I am doing anything wrong.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. She’d known Alice since she’d moved to London as a teenager after her Aunt Lilia thought to introduce them when she realized Rio had no friends her age. She got along with all her new tutors and the chauffeur Lilia insisted she use but no one would understand Rio like a friend would. So, Lilia reached out to some acquaintances who told her that a new diplomat's daughter had also recently moved to England and knew no one.</p><p>From that point on, Alice and Rio had been as thick as thieves. “Nothing about it perturbs you?” she asked again. While afternoon tea wasn’t the <i>best</i> place to hope no one was eavesdropping, Rio’s curiosity won out.</p><p>“I find myself quite relaxed after a session with Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>“Maybe I should try it after one of my nightmares.”</p><p>“I’ll give you her calling card,” Alice replied. “You can try going after a nightmare if you’d like, but I think it’s best to go now and take preventive measures. After a few sessions, Dr. Harkness insists that you should have all the tools to calm yourself at home. Interesting business model, considering she is essentially sending her clients away but-”</p><p>“I understand,” Rio replied hurriedly, taking the card Alice had produced from her small handbag and putting it in her own. “I’ll visit soon.”</p><p>Alice laughed, and Rio could tell it was the polite one she usually reserved when Rio said something particularly inane. “She’s a busy woman.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So,” Alice continued, “I recommend you go and make an appointment now. Her assistant will let you know when to return. Usually, it takes a few days.”</p><p>Rio grits her teeth, her corset suddenly feeling like it was tightening. “Fine. I’ll go now, but if I get in trouble with my aunt or someone sees me I’ll-”</p><p>“It’s very discreet,” Alice replied quickly. “No one will see you who doesn’t want their own secret revealed. And as for your aunt, leave that to me. I have to pass by that area anyway.”</p><p>“You want to gossip with Jennifer,” Rio said smugly.</p><p>Alice gasped. “I do <i>not</i>. She just has very strong opinions and I happen to care a great deal about them.”</p><p>Rio smiled wide, poking her cheek with her tongue as she often did when teasing someone. “I’m sure you’ll hear all about who in South Kensington was seen where and leaving what and with who and still won’t be done by the time Dr. Harkness cures me.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes in response. “I highly doubt that.”</p><p>And so, Rio found herself in her carriage, heading towards the address inscribed on the back of the card Alice had given her.</p><p>“Are you sure this is where you’re going?” her driver, Charon, asked.</p><p>Rio nodded. It was a quick ride through various alleyways until arriving in a part of the city Rio didn’t recognize but was still beautiful. Her driver opened the door without making eye contact. “Thank you.”</p><p>Charon nodded. “I’ll wait around the corner. No need to worry.”</p><p>As he sped off, Rio realized he might have had some idea as to what she was about to do and was slightly confused as to why he wouldn’t wait out front for her like he usually did. Still, she turned to the clinic behind her and walked in.</p><p>A young man sat behind a desk, furiously scribbling something in his notebook, until he realized he wasn’t alone. “Hello! Do you have an appointment to see Dr. Harkness?”</p><p>Rio nervously shook her head. “No. I- I- I was hoping to make one.”</p><p>The man just smiled kindly at her. “No problem. I can make one for you. What’s your name?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Rio,” he replied, picking up a different notebook and opening it up. “I’m William, but you can call me Billy, most people do. Now, let’s see here.”</p><p>Billy ran his finger through the words on the page and then flipped it over, but before he could say anything else, a loud moan echoed through the space.</p><p>“Does…does the procedure hurt?” Rio asked, confused. Alice had mentioned it was painless, but the moan sounded feral, almost animalistic.</p><p>“Not at all,” Billy replied. Rio noticed a blush rising to his cheeks. “From what I understand most women find it…pleasing. Um, but, regarding setting up an appointment.” Another moan rang out. “How about next Tuesday?”</p><p>“Tuesday?” Rio asked, a bit sharply after refocusing on what Billy had said. It was Thursday and Tuesday seemed like too long of a wait. “Can’t you do anything sooner? I’ve been struggling with nightmares for a fortnight and my best friend said this would help cure them. She’s another patient of Dr. Harkness. Alice W-”</p><p>“We don’t use last names here,” Billy interjected, quickly and sharply. “Patient privacy is incredibly important.” After a beat, he added, “I’m glad your friend believes in Dr. Harkness, and I’m sure she would appreciate that. Why don’t you take a seat and wait a moment? She doesn’t usually take walk-ins but she has made exceptions in the past.” He gestured towards the empty waiting room and Rio sighed before following his suggestion.</p><p>The clinic was plain but nice, not that Rio had been in very many. It was bright, rare afternoon sun rays breaking through the window, and smelled slightly of cleaning solution. She knew doctors were in high demand, but someone as specialized as Dr. Harkness, and a female doctor no less, was probably less so, hence the empty room. A final moan reached the space and Rio noticed Billy cringe before looking at her, trying to apologize for something, but Rio had no idea what.</p><p>A few moments later, a door slammed and two women appeared from the long hallway beside Billy’s desk. One of them had flowing red hair and a blissful expression on her face. The other looked much more reserved. Her features were somehow both sharp and soft, accentuated by how her brown hair had been pulled up and away from her face, and her eyes a piercing blue.</p><p>What shocked Rio most though, is that unlike herself or the other woman, Dr. Harkness was wearing men’s clothing. Rio had never seen a woman in a buttoned shirt and trousers, yet Dr. Harkness wasn’t only wearing them, but wearing them <i>well</i>. Her white shirt was starched and rolled up to reach her elbows, no doubt due to how she needed her hands in performing physical exams, and her brown trousers fit the curve of her hips so perfectly, a voice in the back of Rio’s head wanted to know who her tailor was.</p><p>“Thank you, <i>so much</i>, Dr. Harkness,” the redhead practically purred, breaking Rio out of her thoughts.</p><p>Dr. Harkness gave her a curt nod in return. “Billy will help you schedule your next session. I recommend we wait a month to see each other again so you can practice some of the techniques we’ve worked on with your husband.”</p><p>“Oh yes,” her patient replied. “I’m not sure he’ll be able to do what you do, but we’ll try.”</p><p>The woman turned to Billy as Dr. Harkness finally spotted Rio. “Hello,” she said in a warm, honeyed voice. “Who might you be?”</p><p>“New patient,” Billy answered for her before refocusing on scheduling the other woman.</p><p>“I can see that, Billy,” Dr. Harkness replied slightly annoyed. “What’s <i>your</i> name?” she asked pointedly, making it clear she was speaking to Rio and Rio alone.</p><p>“I’m Rio,” she replied. She could feel herself staring impolitely into Dr. Harkness’s blue eyes, but couldn’t look away. “Your eyes.”</p><p>“Oh, right, thank you,” Dr. Harkness said quietly, almost as if she’d forgotten what she looked like. “I’m sorry but, do you have an appointment? I could’ve sworn Wanda was my last patient of the day.”</p><p>“Thank you again,” the woman, Wanda, said as she walked out of the clinic.</p><p>“She was,” Billy replied. “But Rio was hoping for a walk-in? Your next one is Tuesday and she’s been struggling for a while now.”</p><p>“Well, we wouldn’t want that.”</p><p>“I figured you two could do a quick introductory session.”</p><p>Dr. Harkness sighed. “William, I’ve told you many times that the introductory session cannot be rushed.”</p><p>“I’ll simply return on Tuesday then,” Rio began, standing to leave.</p><p>“No,” Dr. Harkness replied sharply. “No,” she repeated, a bit gentler. “I’ll do it. I just need a second to compose myself and wash my hands. Please,” she added, gesturing down the hall. “Up the stairs and then it’s the only door on the left.”</p><p>Rio nodded and acted as though she didn’t scurry away. She could hear Dr. Harkness and Billy having a whispered argument but knew it wasn’t her place to know why.</p><p>The door had been left open and Rio, who already felt as though she had a confusing day, was surprised yet again. Unlike the rest of the clinic, Agatha’s office was…warm. It looked like a condensed version of someone’s bedroom, with a small bed with piles of blankets shoved under a window. Across from that was a table with two chairs and a bookcase, packed to the brim with medical journals, Rio thought. The walls were a deep purple and there was a dark green rug covering the hardwood floors by the bed.</p><p>Between the bed and the table was a settee and a low table in front of it with the only medical instruments Rio could see lined up in a row. She had no idea what each did or what they measured, but the familiarity of having something like them there eased Rio. She chose to sit in one of the chairs, assuming Dr. Harkness would let her know how to proceed once she arrived.</p><p>Rio heard her thundering up the steps before Dr. Harkness appeared and shut the door behind her. “As Billy told you, we take patient privacy very seriously, but not so seriously that he can't perform his job correctly and ask you the questions on the intake questionnaire.”</p><p>“I might have distracted him and-”</p><p>Dr. Harkness waved her off as she sat opposite Rio. “It’s fine. Unfortunately, it’s not the first or the last time he’s done this. So, Rio, first question, how old are you?”</p><p>“Five and twenty,” Rio replied. “Almost an old spinstress,” she added jokingly.</p><p>Dr. Harkness raised a single eyebrow. “Oh? And what does that make me? Unmarried at thirty-one?”</p><p>Heat rose to Rio’s cheeks. “No, no! Of course not, Dr. Harkness! I was only-”</p><p>“I know,” Dr. Harkness replied with a smile. “I was only teasing you. You seemed tense in the waiting room.”</p><p>“I’ve just…I think I’ve misunderstood what happens here.”</p><p>Dr. Harkness leaned over the table, and Rio felt her breath catch at the proximity. “What do you think happens?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio began, feeling her chest tighten once more. “My friend Alice explained that she…undresses and then you cure her. She said it’s painless but that other woman who was here before me, Wanda, seemed to be screaming in hurt. And she was dressed normally but my driver told me he’d wait around the corner, which means that something is happening he wants to take no part in. So, I guess to answer your question, I’m not sure what happens because no one will tell me which, yes, makes me tense, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair after rambling, hoping the decreased proximity would help her situation. She didn’t mention it, but something about Dr. Harkness herself made Rio’s stomach flip over, which Rio could only assume meant she was uneasy.</p><p>“Call me Agatha,” Dr. Harkness replied after a few minutes of studying Rio.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio echoed as if testing how the name tasted in her mouth.</p><p>Agatha finally leaned away from the table and from the notebook she’d been writing in and mimicked Rio’s position. “I promise you, I will answer every single question you have. I will make sure you always feel heard and feel like you are in control of your body. If you want to explore within your own boundaries, we can talk about that later, but right now, the most important thing for me is that you feel comfortable under my care, do you understand?”</p><p>“I don’t even know <i>what</i> your care is,” Rio replied petulantly.</p><p>Agatha raised a hand. “I understand that too. I help women, Rio. I teach them ways to manage their frustrations, anxieties, and overall problems using completely natural methods. Most of the basic techniques are something women can do in the privacy of their own homes, but I’ve discovered that many of them don’t know where to even begin. It does require…a certain level of trust because yes, you will be naked, but again, you will never do something you don’t want to.</p><p>I will teach you of the body and the mind and the pleasures that come in uniting the two. This will, in turn, help you sleep better, have fewer headaches, feel less stressed, and feel more confident in yourself. If that sounds like a practice you’d like to follow, I can help you, but if not, I am afraid you’ll need to turn elsewhere. My practice is unorthodox, which is probably why your chauffeur was smart enough to not have your carriage anywhere near my clinic, but it also works. I promise you that. And I know that was a lot, so I want to ask, will we be moving forward now or do you need some time to think about it?”</p><p>“I- I- Yes, I want this,” Rio stuttered out.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha replied with a gentle smile once more. “One more thing.”</p><p>And so, a week after their first meeting, Rio found herself in Dr. Harkness’s clinic once more.</p><p>“I’m going to ask that you undress to your comfort level,” Agatha stated, washing her hands in a small basin she’d brought into the room. “But, I need to access the apex of your thighs.”</p><p>Rio complied, shedding everything but her chemise. It was cream and thin, leaving very little to the imagination, but still, Rio felt more comfortable with <i>something</i> on.</p><p>Agatha instructed her to lie on the settee before grabbing a large metal device with a thick cord. “Rio,” she began, voice dipping into a honeyed register, “I need you to begin by touching yourself.”</p><p>“Touching myself?” Rio questioned, confused. “Touching myself how?”</p><p>“You don’t-” Agatha cut herself off before exhaling. “Alright, I…I realized I forgot to ask you something when you were here last.”</p><p>“Oh, of course.”</p><p>“Have you ever been pleasured?”</p><p>Rio turned bright red at those words. “Pardon me?”</p><p>“Have you ever been pleasured, darling?” Agatha repeated. “Have you ever been touched anywhere other than the places you consider proper?”</p><p>“I- I- I-” Rio felt her brain getting stuck on the idea. “No, of course not, I’m not married!”</p><p>“Plenty of unwed women have been touched,” Agatha countered. “It’s alright that you haven’t though. It just means I’ll have to start from the very beginning.”</p><p>A shiver ran through Rio’s spine, despite the fact that she had no idea what Dr. Harkness meant.</p><p>“Sit up,” Agatha said, placing the device on the table and moving to sit beside Rio.</p><p>Rio, who was now gripping the edge of the velvet fabric underneath her, stared at the ground. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“You have nothing to be sorry for,” Agatha replied. “I’m just surprised is all. You’re, well, you’re beautiful. And the men in London are remiss to not court you.”</p><p>“I don’t care much for men,” Rio shrugged, “if I’m being honest. Something about them is simply…displeasing to me.”</p><p>Agatha licked her lips and continued staring at Rio’s side profile. She’d never felt the way she did when looking at other patients, but something about Rio made her want to be reckless. “Can I try something?”</p><p>“I thought the whole reason I was here was to try something new?” Rio replied with a nervous chuckle.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said before correcting herself. “I mean, yes, but what I want to try is something I don’t really do with patients. Or anyone, really, but I think it would benefit you.”</p><p>“I’d do anything to cure my hysteria,” Rio countered.</p><p>“You’re not hysterical,” Agatha replied, raising a hand to brush some of Rio’s errant curls behind her ear. “I think you’re just lonely.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said dumbly. “I don’t know.”</p><p>Agatha’s land lingered before she leaned forward and placed a kiss on Rio’s cheek. The skin beneath her lips was soft, Agatha realized, with a pleasant, earthy smell. “How did that feel?”</p><p>“Um,” Rio tried to think of the right words. “Warm, perhaps?”</p><p>“There’s no right answer,” Agatha said, placing another kiss against Rio’s face, lower this time, closer to her jawline. “Just observations.”</p><p>“I feel warm inside,” Rio replied firmly. “It’s…nice.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, turning Rio’s head to face her, and placed a kiss on the corner of Rio’s mouth. “And now?”</p><p>“I wish you would kiss me,” Rio breathed out. Before Agatha could fulfill her wish, Rio’s eyes widened and she pulled away. “I apologize! I misspoke!”</p><p>“I don’t think you did,” Agatha said quickly. “Remember what I told you. I’m here to help you.”</p><p>“Dr. Harkness, I don’t kno-”</p><p>“Call me Agatha.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio continued. “I’ve never been kissed.”</p><p>“<i>Really</i>?” That did surprise Agatha. “Not even as a girl? In any party games?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Like I said, I’ve never cared for men.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and leaned in once more. “Men aren’t the only people you can kiss.” She came a hair's breadth away from Rio’s mouth. “You can always tell me not to, though.”</p><p>Rather than replying, Rio chose to be brave for once. She closed the gap between them, pressing her lips to Agatha’s. It was…nice. She could feel her shoulders drop as she grew comfortable pressing small kisses against Agatha’s lips. Agatha’s hands rose to frame Rio’s face and Rio mirrored her by holding onto Agatha’s forearms. She wasn’t forceful or gripping, she simply wanted to feel more of Agatha.</p><p>After a few moments, Rio felt Agatha’s tongue trace the seam of her mouth. She gasped in shock and Agatha took the opportunity to lick <i>inside</i> her mouth. The warmth Rio felt in her belly increased tenfold. She let Agatha lead, allowing herself to be eaten alive.</p><p>After what felt like hours, Agatha pulled away, a string of spit still connecting the two. “How did that make you feel?”</p><p>“Really good,” Rio replied with a blush. “Really…excited but nervous but…wanting.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said before swooping back in for another kiss.</p><p>The two continued on that way for a while, trading kisses and quiet moans before Agatha placed her hands on Rio’s waist and practically lifted her onto Agatha’s lap. Rio moaned louder than before as she adjusted herself. Agatha grunted for a second as if trying to shift Rio while she was still moving, and that’s when Rio felt it.</p><p>There was a hardness in Agatha’s lap. It was deeply unfamiliar to Rio yet, she knew what it was. She had heard whisperings and titterings from classmates and women whom she met for tea which she could hardly stand. But…this was <i>Agatha</i>, and Agatha hadn’t led her astray yet.</p><p>Before Rio could ask what she was dying to ask, there was a knock on the door and a person clearing their throat. “Agatha?” Billy said loudly from the other side of the door. “Jennifer Kale is here to see you.”</p><p>Rio tried to stare in bright blue eyes, but Agatha’s head turned as she took deep breaths. “Give me another five minutes, Billy. This session was…complicated.”</p><p>“Okay!” The two of them heard Billy’s footsteps retreat before Agatha sighed.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Rio.”</p><p>“No,” Rio replied, shaking her head. “This is your job. I…Thank you.” She shifted to get off of Agatha, but the hands around her waist tightened.</p><p>“This is my job,” Agatha replied, steel lacing her words. “But I have never done to a patient what I just did with you.”</p><p>Rio blushed. “I’ve never done that with a doctor either.”</p><p>Agatha snorted in laughter as Rio finally stood and began dressing herself. “Do you need help with your corset?”</p><p>“I’ll manage,” Rio replied, trying to move as quickly as she could. “Same time next week?”</p><p>“You want to come back?” Agatha sounded surprised, which pleased Rio.</p><p>“I’d like to.”</p><p>“I’d like that very much.”</p><p>And with that, Rio found herself at Agatha Harkness’s clinic for the next few weeks, slowly, but surely, progressing through her symptoms.</p><p>The following week, Agatha kissed her again and this time, she instructed Rio to touch her own breasts over her chemise, slowly and softly, until Rio was practically writhing against Agatha on the couch.</p><p>The next, Rio’s hands went under the fabric and she touched again, adding the lazy pump of her fingers into herself, first one, then two, under Agatha’s guidance. Her thighs trembled hard and Agatha assured her it was natural, all while staring at her glistening hand.</p><p>After that, they moved to the bed, where Rio finally removed her last article of clothing and Agatha finally managed to show her the invention she had presented during their first session. It was a personal massager, of sorts, and Agatha assured her that she made a new one for each of her patients, labeling it with their names when storing them. After trading a few kisses, Rio repeated the actions she had previously, touching across her chest and waking her senses up, as Agatha stared, lips slightly swollen from their previous activities, eyes glazed over, and shirtsleeves rolled up, as though she was preparing for surgery.</p><p>Rio was nervous until she felt the vibrations, just off center of where she suddenly, and with deep conviction, knew she needed them most. “Please.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up from where she had been looking at the thatch of hair between Rio’s legs, to Rio’s dark brown eyes. “What?”</p><p>“Please,” Rio begged once more. “To the left a bit. I- I- I- <i>Oh</i>,” she groaned out as Agatha followed instructions.</p><p>Agatha explained what was happening in a shaky voice as Rio continued to moan beneath her. “That’s…um…that is your clitoral nerve. It’s a pleasure center and…ah…stimulating it, as we- we- we are doing now helps. Helps with, um, the, um, helps with your…curing your hysteria.”</p><p>If Rio found this strange, she didn’t let on. Instead, a hand reached out and grasped Agatha’s wrist tightly. “More.”</p><p>Agatha turned it up to the highest vibration and followed the movements of Rio’s hips, guided by the other woman’s hand until Rio wasn’t making sense. “Please, I need, Agatha, oh!”</p><p>Rio’s legs began to quake and Agatha felt a sense of pride wash over her. It had never felt this way when she was helping others, and she chalked it up to Rio needing more guidance than most. “Well done,” she said when Rio finally pushed the massager away and gulped down deep breaths.</p><p>“‘S it normal to feel <i>this</i> sleepy after you use that instrument?” Rio asked, eyes fluttering shut.</p><p>Agatha nodded, not realizing Rio couldn’t see her. “It’s perfectly natural,” she assured, running through her post-orgasm checklist as she put the massager away. “You’ll probably feel a bit more tired the first few times as well since you’re not yet used to the feeling. But some patients can come three or four times in a single session, once they’ve built up to it.”</p><p>She turned and realized Rio hadn’t heard a single word she’d said, quiet snores permeating the space. Agatha smiled and pulled a blanket over Rio’s naked body, before having the strangest urge to place a kiss on the other woman’s forehead. She forewent it, opting instead to rush downstairs and have Billy cancel all of her appointments for the rest of the day before returning to Rio in the examination room and updating her notes.</p><p>Rio slept for a few hours before waking with a start. Agatha rushed to her side, having switched her journal for reading a while ago. “You’re alright, you’re alright. You fell asleep here and I decided you should nap. I know you mentioned lack of sleep on your intake form and-”</p><p>“Have I ruined your entire day, Dr. Harkness?” Rio interrupted, feeling a sense of embarrassment and shame overcome her as she stared straight ahead.</p><p>“No, sweet girl,” Agatha replied, shaking her head and placing a hand on the side of Rio's neck.”You actually gave me a lot to think about as you lay sleeping.”</p><p>“You have?” Rio was lost, but there was something grounding about the way Agatha’s thumb caressed her jaw.</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha hummed. “I came up with a new design for my next massager. Similar in style with a bigger head, and more speed settings. More than one person might be able to use it at the same time.”</p><p>“That’s wonderful,” Rio replied, breathlessly. She wasn’t sure exactly how it would work, but if Agatha managed to create one, she knew she’d want to use it with her.</p><p>“And, I also thought about my work,” Agatha continued. “My likes and dislikes about this position. How I want to help people but also want to be selfish.”</p><p>At that, Rio turned. “Selfish? How could you possibly be selfish? You’ve helped so many women?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I have and I’m proud of it. But, I…I want more. This is a lonely profession, especially for someone like me. I wish I could have less patients and simply sell my products instead. Maybe not be…as lonely as I am.”</p><p>“You’re not lonely,” Rio quickly countered. She placed her hand over Agatha’s, pressing it to her skin. “You have me. And Billy. And all of your other patients. I’m sure there are several who’d want to be your friend like I am.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, shark and quick, before staring at Rio in disbelief. “Rio, darling, do you know what we’re doing here?”</p><p>“You’re curing my hysteria,” Rio said plainly.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha repeated, with another look. “We are having sex.”</p><p>Rio blinked once. Twice. “<i>What?</i>”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped and she pulled away, standing and running a hand through her hair, which was tied in a low bun. “Did you not know? I thought we had gone over this?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio began. “No, yes, I mean, I must’ve known but I thought…”</p><p>“You thought what?” Agatha asked, a horrified look crossing her face.</p><p>“I thought you needed to be in love to have sex.”</p><p>“How would I be in love with all of my patients?” Agatha replied, trying to wrap her head around what Rio was saying.</p><p>“<i>You</i> don’t have to be in love with anyone. <i>We</i> have to be in love with you.”</p><p>“Oh dear,” Agatha replied, now beginning to pace across the floor.</p><p>Rio felt the tension in the room rising and wrapped the blanket that had been tucking her in around herself. “If you point me to another room, I can get dressed there. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”</p><p>Agatha stopped and turned to face Rio. She felt both hopeful and helpless, unsure how to explain herself to the woman standing before her. “There is a small washroom across the hall. You can change there. And then, if you so choose, you can come up to my apartment upstairs. It’s small, but it works for me. I think we need to have a bigger conversation.”</p><p>“Won’t anyone see me in the hall?”</p><p>Agatha tried her best to smile. “I canceled the rest of my appointments and sent Billy home when you fell asleep.”</p><p>“I’m so-”</p><p>“Don’t apologize,” Agatha interrupted. “I think you may have changed my life for the better.”</p>

<p>Rio knew it was cowardly, and still, as soon as she got dressed, she bolted.</p><p>She couldn’t tell if she heard Agatha calling out or not as she ran down the stairs, but she didn’t care. The desk was unoccupied and yet, the front door was unlocked. The minute she made eye contact with Charon, she nodded quickly and threw herself in the backseat of the carriage.</p><p>“To Miss Wu’s, quickly,” she instructed.</p><p>Rio was breathless, her mind a mess.</p><p>On the one hand, she’d grown to care deeply for Agatha. She was wonderful at guiding Rio and kissing and helping her with…whatever it was they were doing. And even before they reached this point, Agatha had been someone Rio felt comfortable with.</p><p>But it also made Rio nervous to essentially be the reason why Agatha might close down shop. Not to mention the fact that Rio practically confessed her love for the other woman without any type of acknowledgment that Agatha liked her back. Despite Rio’s inexperience, she wasn’t a total idiot. She knew what they had been doing <i>technically</i> qualified as sex but, to Rio, it was so much more.</p><p>The carriage slowed and Rio took a deep breath in before Charon opened the door for her. She nodded in thanks before sprinting up the steps to the front entrance of Alice’s city home, hoping her friend would excuse her disheveled look.</p><p>Alice herself opened the door, a rare occurrence, and ushered Rio inside. “Rio? Are you alright?”</p><p>Rio shook her head and began pacing in the foyer. “No, no, I am not. There’s…there’s so much to tell you, Al, and honestly, I don’t even know where to begin. I feel like I’m in the middle of this <i>huge</i> mess despite the fact that I didn’t <i>know</i> I was <i>in</i> the huge mess until today and-”</p><p>She stopped abruptly when she saw Jennifer Kale’s head pop out of the double doors leading to the sitting room. “Would you like tea?” Jen asked, as if she too, lived in the home.</p><p>“I…” Rio trailed off, looking at Alice in a panic.</p><p>Alice sighed. “She’ll do tea,” she replied to Jen before grabbing Rio by the elbow gently. “Please, do come in. Jen and I were spending some time together before I received a rather bizarre feeling that you were coming over. A premonition, of sorts.”</p><p>“Must be fate,” Rio mumbled as she spread out on the couch closest to the large bay windows facing the Wu-Gulliver’s back gardens.</p><p>Jen returned quickly and the three enjoyed a pot of strong herbal tea with a hit of something more. “I sensed we’d need a bit of a kick,” Jen added with a wink once Rio realized that <i>kick</i> was indeed whiskey.</p><p>“So,” Alice continued, “what’s wrong?”</p><p>Rio placed her cup and saucer down on the table in front of her, hands folded in her lap, and then felt her entire body sag into the settee as she began to talk about Agatha. She shared how kind and honest Agatha had been during their sessions, how she’d helped Rio discover a part of her that felt like it had been locked away, and how eager she’d been this afternoon, just before Rio left with no warning.</p><p>“Now,” she said quietly, “I’m not sure what to do. I’m not sure I can be with her.”</p><p>Jen took a polite sip of her drink just as Alice spoke. “Is it because she’s a woman?”</p><p>Jen immediately spit her drink back into her cup. “Al, maybe now is not-”</p><p>Rio was startled but said nothing.</p><p>“I just ask,” Alice interrupted with a small smile towards Jen, “because I know Rio’s very prim and proper and-”</p><p>“So are you,” Rio countered.</p><p>“I’m a bit less buttoned up thank you.”</p><p>“A lot less last night,” Jen mumbled beside her on the couch opposite RIo.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flit quickly between the two women. “Am I…I’m missing something big aren’t I?”</p><p>“I don’t think-” Jen tried again, but still, Alice interrupted once more and echoed her previous question.</p><p>“Is it because she is a woman? Is there an issue for you there?”</p><p>Rio gave them one last look of intrigue and then stared at her lap, thinking, before looking up, making eye contact with Alice once more. “No, I don’t think so,” she replied resolutely.</p><p>“You don’t?” Alice repeated.</p><p>“No. I just, well, I’ve never cared about men,” Rio stated, feeling more and more secure in her words as she spoke. “And I think, deep down, I knew I was different than most but I never minded it. I’ve always thought women were incredibly beautiful. I’ve thought about what it would be like to…to court someone. Usually, when I pictured it in my head, I would always imagine it from the perspective of a man courting a woman. I just figured I’d end up like Aunt Lilia. An older woman who became mysteriously rich by the hands of many dead suitors never husbands.”</p><p>Jen laughed as Alice let out a little sigh of relief. “I didn’t know you felt this way.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio replied. “Does it…does it matter to <i>you</i> that <i>she’s</i> a woman?”</p><p>“Not at all,” Alice said before quickly adding, “But she’s not the type of woman I’m interested in.”</p><p>Jen perked up beside her. “Oh? What type of woman might that be?”</p><p>“I’m sure you’ll figure it out,” Alice replied, a blush dusting her cheeks.</p><p>“Are you two…?” Rio said with a tilt of her head slightly as if she was trying to decipher something.</p><p>“We have a lot to discuss,” Alice brushed it off to the side. “What’s important now is how you’re feeling.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio suddenly felt herself get even more nervous than she already was. “Alice, I feel…I feel like I might love her, but she won’t love me back.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Why do you say that?”</p><p>“She cares for me, I know that,” Rio replied, “but she has so many other patients that go to her. I’m not sure I’m special for falling in love with a woman who makes me feel the way she does.”</p><p>Alice’s brow furrowed as Jen’s eyebrows rose high. “Rio,” Jen began, slowly, “I’ve gone to see Dr. Harkness a few times. I promise you, she has <i>never</i> done to me the things you’ve said she’s done to you.”</p><p>“<i>Really</i>?” Rio couldn’t hide her shock.</p><p>“Really,” Jen confirmed. “Before this afternoon, I wasn’t even sure her first name <i>was</i> Agatha. She was very reserved with me. Clinical, the way a doctor should be, and efficient, too, but there isn’t any sense that she would like me like that. I’ve never kissed her, never looked into her eyes, really. She was just a means to an end that I could not find by myself.”</p><p>Alice grimaced. “She was warmer with me, slightly, I think. Not as efficient, but maybe that has more to do with me and my preferences than with her,” she acquiesced. “I have to agree with Jen, though. From what you’ve mentioned this afternoon, she already has a special relationship with you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio felt her chest tighten as she took in everything that was said. “I…I didn’t realize. I don’t even know what to do with this information.”</p><p>Alice sensed that her best friend was on the verge of tears and crossed the space to sit beside her. She took Rio’s hands in her own, squeezing them gently to offer some type of reassurance. “It’s alright. I think the only thing you <i>can</i> do right now is give yourself time. Maybe try to understand your emotions better and see why Doctor-, sorry, Agatha,” she added pointedly, “has made you feel this way.”</p><p>“I second Alice,” Jen chimed in.</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and then moved to embrace Alice before reaching a hand out to Jen to squeeze. “Thank you to the two of you for being such good friends.” They both smiled, then laughed as Rio added, “And when I figure out this mess, I need to know the details of yours.”</p><p>+++</p><p>True to Alice’s and Jen’s advice, Rio didn’t return to see Agatha for a few days, despite the other woman consuming her every thought.</p><p>Agatha was the first person she thought of when she woke. Agatha was the person whom she focused on when she did her needlepoint and baking. Agatha is whom she’d accidentally drawn in her sketch pad at least four times. And Agatha was the one consuming her thoughts at night, leaving her hot and sweaty with an empty feeling when she woke up panting from yet another dream.</p><p>If her Aunt Lilia noticed, she, thankfully, didn’t say anything. However, Rio did receive fewer weekend chores and Lilia just muttered something about the girl needing more time to get out more.</p><p>“I go out with friends plenty,” Rio insisted.</p><p>“Not enough,” Lilia sharply replied. “Not enough to find a suitor and not enough to reasonably squander the wealth I’ll leave you with when I die.”</p><p>“You’re not dying.”</p><p>“We all die someday,” Lilia replied, as she usually did.</p><p>But after the weekend had passed and after Rio had completed every chore in Lilia’s to-do list, she ran out of ways to rationalize why she hadn’t seen Agatha yet.</p><p>On a rainy Wednesday afternoon, she got herself ready, ran downstairs, and insisted that Charon take her to see Dr. Harkness.</p><p>The man frowned. “You usually go on Fridays.”</p><p>“Change of schedule,” Rio replied.</p><p>“If you insist,” her driver agreed and they set off to the clinic once more.</p><p>When they arrived, Rio noticed someone inside the waiting room through the windows and waved Charon off. “I’d rather you go home. The storm is supposed to get bad so I’ll simply stay here for the night.”</p><p>Rio knew he would find this odd, but she did not care enough to make excuses. As she crossed the street, the gentle rain picked up, her overcoat taking the brunt of it, not yet soaked to the bone but definitely waterlogged.</p><p>She tried to open the front door to no avail. Yet, she was hearing footsteps shuffle across the space inside. To her left, a door appeared and out popped Billy’s head. “Rio,” he said with a grin. “Come in.”</p><p>Through the door was a small hallway and a set of short, tall stairs to the far end. “Where are we?”</p><p>“Entrance to Agatha’s apartment,” Billy replied, seeming genuinely pleased she was there. “It’s on the third story so usually she just cuts through the clinic at the end of the day, but since she’s not doing that anymore, I figured I’d let you in the old-fashioned way.”</p><p>There was a lot for Rio to unpack but as she stood there, shivering slightly, she only thought of one thing. “Agatha’s upstairs?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Billy jumped back as if only now realizing Rio was forming a small puddle under her feet. “But you must be cold! And wet! Here, let's get you warm.”</p><p>He led her up the rickety stairs, through another hallway, and yet another flight of stairs, before landing on a door. Rio inhaled sharply, preparing for whatever might be on the other side of the door, but Billy just continued with his usual smile.</p><p>He knocked and she heard a faint, “Coming,” before the door swung open. “Did you forget something, Billy?”</p><p>“Rio’s here,” Billy replied, but she was sure Agatha didn’t hear him. She was clearly too busy gaping at Rio’s presence like a fish out of water.</p><p>When neither person said anything, Billy slightly shoved Rio forward. “Alright, well, now that you’re both…together, I’ll leave you to it.”</p><p>He grabbed the door from Agatha’s hand and closed it, leaving just the two of them inside.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure what to expect from Agatha’s apartment, having become so intimately familiar with the clinic’s space. It was similar, full of warmth and calm, whilst still being completely different.</p><p>If Rio thought Agatha had a lot of books downstairs, nothing could compare to the stacks upon stacks that she saw up here. Her many plants were all on the verge of death, but somehow still alive. There was a lot more of Agatha’s personality up here too; a vibrant rug no doubt sourced whilst Agatha was traveling, a purple throw over her couch, an unlit fireplace boasting what Rio assumed were familial trinkets atop it.</p><p>It was a neatly kept apartment, and while Rio could see the kitchen and sitting room, she did not know where Agatha’s bedroom might be beyond the singular hallway connecting the entire space.</p><p>“You’re here,” Agatha sighed out in disbelief.</p><p>Rio smiled gently. It was hard to take her eyes away from Agatha’s arms, considering the other woman wore a shirt without sleeves and loose trousers. “I am.”</p><p>“I…Um…” Agatha tried. “Would you like to sit? Something to drink, maybe?”</p><p>“I’m fine for now,” Rio replied, motioning to take a seat on her couch.</p><p>“Oh, yes,” Agatha agreed. “May I take your coat?”</p><p>Rio blushed as she took it off, slightly embarrassed to have left her home in basically nothing but her nightclothes. She’d thrown her overcoat over everything, not caring in the moment.</p><p>Thankfully, Agatha, ever the gentlewoman, said nothing and simply hung it up on the rack next to her own as Rio finally sat. The chaise was far less comfortable than the one downstairs and Rio absentmindedly thought about whether Agatha did that on purpose. “I’m…I was surprised to find the clinic closed.”</p><p>Agatha made some noncommittal noise, puttering around the space as she made tea despite what Rio had said. “I haven’t opened it since…well, you know.”</p><p>Rio was surprised and tried not to let it show on her face. “No?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha confirmed succinctly.</p><p>The two sat in comfortable silence until Agatha finally brought forth two teacups and a kettle to the table in front of Rio. She took a seat on the opposite end of the chaise and smiled softly.</p><p>“I’ve been-” “How are-” they both tried at the same time before quiet, nervous chuckles.</p><p>“You first,” Rio added.</p><p>“How are you <i>really</i>?” Agatha asked, biting her lower lip slightly.</p><p>“I am,” Rio began, thinking the question over seriously before answering. “I am doing well. It was…a lot to unpack at first but I spoke with some friends and realized that my feelings for you were actually much less complicated than I believed them to be.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows rose but she nodded in understanding. “Less complicated?”</p><p>“Don’t take this the wrong way,” Rio continued, “but I didn’t realize what we were doing was special. I simply thought that was how you acted with all of your patients and, well, I didn’t want to seem like a fool when we conversed after my last appointment so I ran.”</p><p>“I don’t blame you for that. For running,” Agatha clarified quickly. “I mostly blame myself for not making my own feelings known sooner. I think it would’ve helped ease the confusion you felt.”</p><p>Rio smiled and moved closer to Agatha, their thighs a hair's breadth away from touching. “I think we might need to speak clearly right now, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat and her bright blue eyes flickered down to Rio’s lips before they looked back up into her eyes. “I love you, Rio.” Rio’s breath hitched, but Agatha continued along. “You’ve done something to me that I can’t explain. It’s the way my mind and body react when you walk in, halfway through the last conversation we were having, and look at me. It’s the way you murmur in between our kisses, as though there is something you need to tell me but you can’t help but kiss me. It’s the way you look at me seconds before reaching your peak and call my name and intertwine our fingers,” at those words, Rio performed the action, “and just…I want to give all of me to you, Rio. It’s scary and maddening and exciting and full of love and adoration. You are <i>so</i> special to me.”</p><p>Rio could feel unshed tears in her eyes as she stared at their joined hands. “I love you too.”</p><p>“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you outright just how much I care for you,” Agatha added, lifting their hands to press a kiss against the back of Rio’s.</p><p>A watery, disbelieving laugh came out of Rio. “It took me some time to realize that you didn’t act like <i>that</i> with everyone.”</p><p>“How <i>did</i> you realize, if you don’t mind my asking?”</p><p>“The friends I spoke to, Jennifer and Alice, are patients of yours. I described our relationship and they assured me that you have <i>never</i> done to them what you do to me. You’re practically a completely different person with me.”</p><p>“God help me, I am,” Agatha replied. “And I should apologize for that. I should have kept it professional but I-”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand and interrupted. “I’m glad you didn’t. I never realized I <i>could</i> fall in love with you the way that I did. But I’m happy we got here.”</p><p>Agatha beamed and placed a kiss against her cheek. “Me too.”</p><p>After a moment, Rio sighed and looked back up at Agatha determinedly. “Before I left, before…all of this, you had mentioned not wanting to be a doctor anymore.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I did. And I still want to give it up. I think I have found a better business model.” Rio rose a brow in question. “A personal massager for women, and men, I guess, which helps them cure their aches and pains and hysteria. It’s similar to the prototype I used on you but a bit more portable.”</p><p>“Can I see it?” Rio asked, intrigued.</p><p>Agatha rose, placing a kiss against the back of Rio’s hand once more before letting go and walking back into where she assumed Agatha’s bedroom was.</p><p>When she came back, she held a case similar to the one Rio knew her own massager was stored in. “It’s a bit different,” Agatha began, taking it out of its case. “More…phallic and with new vibrational patterns, but it performs the same end goal. There is also a part of it where the user could grind when, or I guess, <i>if</i> they wish to insert it.”</p><p>Rio blushed as Agatha demonstrated the speeds and motions that could be performed. “Have you tested it yet?”</p><p>Now it was Agatha’s turn to blush. “Um, yes, I have. Although,” she waited another moment, looking at Rio as though she was deciding something. “Not in the way you would use it.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Why? Is it not the same when you do it to yourself compared to when you do it to someone else? To <i>me</i>?”</p><p>Agatha returned the massager to the case and took her seat beside Rio once more. “In the spirit of full honesty, there’s something else I haven’t told you about yet. Something I actually haven’t told anyone in my adult life.”</p><p>“What is it?” Rio asked quietly. She wasn’t sure what else Agatha might say but was scared it had to do with her. She laced their fingers together once more as Agatha grimaced. “Whatever it is, I can handle it.”</p><p>“This is something I’ve been living with my whole life-”</p><p>“I too recently realized I preferred women to men,” Rio interjected.</p><p>“I’ve actually known that about myself all along,” Agatha chuckled, the tension in her shoulders dissipating slightly. “It’s not that, but I’m glad, although…”</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio replied, shuffling closer still so their legs were now pressed up against each other, side by side. “Continue.”</p><p>“When I was born,” Agatha said, picking a spot on the floor and staring into it deeply. “I was born…differently. When I was born, the midwife believed me to be a boy.” She quickly glanced at Rio, whose expression she could not read, and continued. “I presented male anatomy and was raised as one in my youth. But, I never felt comfortable in my skin. I felt like I was an alien on a human planet. When I began to mature, it was clear that I was maturing as a woman would. I just had an added…appendage. At that moment, I made a decision. It was difficult, most people, including my mother, rejected me, but I believe it was the correct decision, and that has allowed me to live the life I do. I know it may have been easier to pretend to be a man and continue on that way, but that was never who I really was. I <i>am</i> Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Finally, Agatha looked back up at Rio. The other woman blinked a few times, a faraway look in her eyes as she connected the pieces together. “So you have a…”</p><p>“A penis, yes.”</p><p>“And you’re a woman?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha confirmed. “But I understand that this is incredibly uncommon and it is totally within your rights to not want me anymore especially because you mentioned how you-”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio interrupted, letting go of her hands in order to cradle Agatha’s face in her palms. “I love <i>you</i>. I just needed a moment to understand, that is all.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha asked quietly. She knew it sounded needy, but she also felt a tear escaping her eyes and needed reassurance.</p><p>“Really,” Rio replied assuredly, wiping away the droplet gently.</p><p>Agatha shuddered and Rio couldn’t help but lean forward, finally placing a kiss against her lips. It was soft, reassuring. A clear statement. <i>I love you as you are</i>.</p><p>What followed was something else, something deeper. The press of lips became headier, mouths opening and tongues tasting until Rio felt like Agatha was about to swallow her whole and she would’ve happily let her.</p><p>After one particular tug against Rio’s bottom lip by Agatha’s teeth, Rio repositioned herself, thankful she’d forgone her usual fluff and petticoat and, like Agatha, worn something a bit more scandalous. The Rio she’d been months ago would have had some type of episode at how improper she looked and dressed and behaved.</p><p>Rio now, however, found herself sitting in Agatha’s lap the way she had the very first time they kissed, feeling like she’d rather her lungs suffer some sort of episode due to a lack of oxygen than actually stop kissing Agatha so she could breathe.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha sighed, dropping her hands from where they’d been holding Rio’s forearms to grasp her waist.</p><p>Guided fully by intuition, Rio rolled her hips once, then twice, feeling a hardness in Agatha’s trousers. Now that she knew what it was, she was eager to finally learn how to please Agatha as the other woman had pleased her for the last couple of months.</p><p>As Rio continued rocking against her, Agatha broke away from their kisses, leading Rio to continue a path with her lips down Agatha’s cheekbone and jaw. “Wait, Rio, wait.”</p><p>“What is it, my love?” Rio asked, leaning back, feeling slightly lust drunk.</p><p>Agatha felt her stomach flip at the pet name and smiled. “I…”</p><p>“Are you shy?” Rio replied incredulously. “After all that we’ve done? You’re shy <i>now</i>?”</p><p>“I just want to make sure this is something <i>you want</i>,” Agatha murmured. “I need clarity too.”</p><p>Rio traced the shape of Agatha’s brow with her thumb. “It is something I want. I know we’ve said a lot of things this afternoon, but I do want to court you. And for you to court me. I want to, someday, become your wife. We may have to get creative as to how we get married,” she added with a chuckle, “but I want that. I want everything that comes with a marriage. I want a big house in the countryside and a large family we adore and friends who annoy us but whom we love endlessly. I want it <i>all</i> with you.”</p><p>Agatha gulped. “Because of my…condition,” she said, “Our marriage <i>could</i> produce a family. I could give you children. And I know a few senile priests who would be willing to marry us.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened but still, she grinned. “How do you know more than one senile priest?”</p><p>“Nuns,” Agatha replied, as though that was an answer enough. When Rio’s brow furrowed, she continued. “A lot of nuns suffer from hysteria. You’d be surprised at how many of them appreciate the company of another woman as well. Therefore, many senile priests turn a blind eye to anything happening in the monastery in exchange for faithful servants of the Lord.”</p><p>“Ah, well, that I can believe,” Rio said. “As for the other thing,” she began, leaning forward, lips brushing against Agatha’s. “I think we should practice. Make sure we are…compatible before we go around professing our love in a church.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled nervously. “Who are you and what have you done to the Rio who entered my clinic?”</p><p>“Darling,” Rio practically purred, placing a quick kiss against Agatha’s lips before moving to whisper against the shell of her ear. “I’ve learned <i>a lot</i> about myself in the days leading up to this.”</p><p>To Rio’s surprise, rather than reply with words, Agatha simply stood, still holding her in her arms, laughing.</p><p>Rio squealed, her legs locking around the small of Agatha’s back as her arms tightened over Agatha’s shoulders. She felt Agatha pressing kisses anywhere she could reach, against Rio’s neck, her collarbone, her chin, her nose, as she walked them down the hallway.</p><p>Rio had been right to assume that it led to Agatha’s bedroom. She didn’t notice much in the space, apart from a large window with the rain pattering quietly against it as the fog rolled across the London sky, and a four-poster bed, sheets still rumpled.</p><p>Agatha placed her on the edge of the mattress and knelt before Rio. She made quick work of her slippers and stockings before trailing her hands along Rio’s legs. There was still a layer covering most of Rio’s body, but Agatha moaned at the soft skin underneath her hands before standing.</p><p>She pulled on Rio’s hand and the other woman stood, the two faced each other, grinning wildly.</p><p>“You first,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha made quick work of unbuttoning her top and stood before Rio’s gaze. Slowly, Agatha grabbed the tie along her waist and undid it, hands shaking slightly before RIo took over. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio practically hissed, a nervous thrill running up her spine. She continued unlacing the pants until they were practically falling off of Agatha. As soon as Rio stepped away, her breath hitched.</p><p>Agatha was beautiful. Handsome. Her unruly, tousled curls brushed the tops of her breasts which gave way to the strong planes of her stomach. There was a trail of hair beneath her belly button, leading to her core, cock already hard and slightly curved. If Rio didn’t know any better, she thought Agatha might be posturing a bit, long fingers flexed, forearms looking strong, and biceps flexed slightly. Her legs were long and freckled.</p><p>Rio could feel the heat in her stomach, the one she usually felt during her visits to Agatha’s clinic, increase tenfold. “Wow,” she whispered under her breath.</p><p>Agatha chuckled and, like a lion circling its prey, moved closer to her. “Now, you.”</p><p>Rio began bunching up the skirt of her dress before Agatha took over, hands firm as they trailed up Rio’s sides. She took her house dress and underlayers off all in one go, leaving her naked in front of Agatha, hair unruly, lips slightly parted. She sensed Agatha was drinking her in the same way she’d just done.</p><p>“You are,” Agatha began, eyes roaming before locking onto Rio’s, “the most beautiful creature I have ever seen in my life.”</p><p>Rio let out a sound between a whine and a moan and, despite the embarrassment she should have felt, crashed their lips together.</p><p>It was right where they left off, raw and messy. She could feel Agatha’s cock press against her stomach as she grew wetter. Rio was walked back to the edge of the mattress by Agatha’s insistent kisses once more and sat, before leaning back on her elbows.</p><p>She expected Agatha to follow up her body but instead, the other woman dropped down to her knees and stared at Rio’s center. “Can I use my mouth?”</p><p>Rio was confused for a moment. “Sure? For what?”</p><p>“Oh god,” Agatha replied, lips trailing along Rio’s inner thigh. “You. Can I use my mouth on you? Instead of my hands?”</p><p>“Oh. <i>Oh</i>,” Rio finally said, connecting the dots. “Yes. Yes, please, darling.”</p><p>Agatha moaned and leaned all the way in, teasing as she performed a few exploratory swipes around Rio’s center before finding her clit with sudden and extreme precision. Rio, who up until that point thought she was about as turned-on as one could be on a scale from 1 to 10, went up to an 11.</p><p>She gripped the back of Agatha’s head and slammed her hips up, only to be stopped by a strong arm against her hips. She continued rolling her body up as Agatha instinctually learned her likes and dislikes, by virtue of how <i>vocal</i> Rio had yet to realize she was being.</p><p>“Yes, yes, Agatha, yes, a bit more, right- <i>Oh, please,</i>” Rio moaned as Agatha’s tongue dipped inside her, then back up.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t faring much better, groaning audibly as Rio felt pressure coiling tightly in her lower stomach. She whined Agatha’s name once more and felt herself go over the edge, stronger than she usually did at the end of her sessions. Her eyes slammed shut as she tried to catch her breath, Agatha’s mouth still on her, lazily swiping, as she came down.</p><p>Rio sat up on her forearms and looked at eyes that were usually cerulean, now near cobalt. “Was that…” Agatha trailed off, chin glistening and sticky as she laid her head against Rio’s thigh.</p><p>“How can I make you feel as good as you just made me feel?” Rio asked bluntly, running her hands through Agatha’s now incredibly messy hair.</p><p>“Oh!” Agatha blushed. She stood slowly and Rio noted that she was rock hard, clearly turned on from what they’d just done. “You could use your hands or your mouth, whichever you're most comfortable with, if you’d like.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio replied, dropping her voice into a new dimension, something more saccharine that had Agatha whining at just hearing her name. “I want…I want all of you if that’s alright.”</p><p>“All of me?”</p><p>“You said you could give me children, did you not?”</p><p>“Well, I mean, yes, I think, technically,” Agatha stumbled out. She wasn’t sure where this confident Rio was emerging from, but she couldn’t say she minded. In fact, she would definitely make a mental note to see how far she could push it. “But, I wouldn’t want you to have a child out of wedlock.”</p><p>“It’s not wedlock if we agree to be married.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I believe there is a courting we must do prior to the marriage. Not to mention, the actual wedding itself.”</p><p>“Please, Agatha,” Rio begged once more. “If you’re really nervous about it you can pull out. I may still be learning about sex but I know <i>that</i> much. I want you.”</p><p>Rio could tell those words affected Agatha more than anything else she’d said. “Say it again.”</p><p>“I,” Rio began, as sultry as she could at that moment, “want you. And only you.”</p><p>Agatha moaned as Rio shuffled back on the bed, adjusting herself amongst Agatha’s pillows. She patted the sheets beside her and Agatha followed obediently.</p><p>They kissed, grounding reassurance that the other person was there. Rio cradled Agatha’s face in her hands as Agatha wrapped an arm around her waist, thumb skating across the thin marks Rio knew she had on her hips.</p><p>Rio could also feel Agatha’s cock against her thigh and felt herself growing wet once more. She tried pulling Agatha’s body even closer but the other woman huffed a laugh against her. “Hold on.”</p><p>Agatha gently maneuvered Rio to lay flat on her back before adjusting herself to fit between her spread legs. Once again, she kissed Rio gently, then continued to lavish her jawline and neck and collarbone.</p><p>When she reached Rio’s breast, she took a nipple in her mouth and sucked, fitting a hand under Rio’s lower back when she arched up in pleasure. Agatha repeated the motion on the other side, making sure to leave marks on the underside and center of Rio’s chest.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio tried to scold. She was impatient and she knew Agatha could sense it. But because of what Agatha was doing to her, it sounded more like a cry for <i>something more</i>.</p><p>“I want to make sure you’re properly lubricated,” she replied.</p><p>“You do not have to worry about that,” Rio mumbled. But Agatha caught the words anyway and smiled slyly.</p><p>“Now look who’s shy.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio echoed, finally sounding like it had a bit more of a bite this time around.</p><p>“Alright, alright,” Agatha conceded. She took hold of herself and began running the head of her cock through Rio’s folds. “This is going to feel different than anything we’ve done, even my fingers, and it’s been a while since I’ve done this so-”</p><p>“I know,” Rio interrupted quietly. “I’m ready.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha whispered and began to guide herself inside Rio trying not to come immediately without actually getting inside fully. “I’ll go slow.”</p><p>Rio was whining out breathy little noises that drove Agatha insane. She wanted to bury herself to the hilt and <i>stay</i> there, but she knew Rio deserved more than that.</p><p>Once she made it all the way in, Rio’s legs instinctually locked around her lower back as she hid in Agatha’s neck. “Give me a minute,” she mumbled against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>“I’ll give you all the time in the world, my love,” Agatha replied.</p><p>After a few more seconds, Rio sighed, sounding slightly more like herself than she had before. “Okay.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha needed the confirmation. She would not move without it.</p><p>Rio nodded into her. “Yes.”</p><p>With that, Agatha began a slow rocking motion against Rio, making sure she was as gentle as possible. She pulled out centimeters at most before guiding herself back in, feeling Rio’s warmth flutter against her, wanting her to stay inside.</p><p>Rio, who knew only the basics and mostly that it hurt from her friends, was amazed. There was a slight discomfort at first but Agatha must’ve been much more skilled than her friend's husbands. The pressure building inside of her felt insurmountable. Rio knew she would be another person on the other side of this because <i>how could one not be?</i></p><p>She threaded her hands through the baby hairs in the nape of Agatha’s neck, snaked between Agatha’s arms which were now framing her face and holding Agatha up. Rio guided her face towards her so that they could kiss.</p><p>Agatha’s thrusting picked up in speed and Rio heard someone making quiet moans of pleasure before realizing they were coming from <i>herself</i>. It was so unlike her to sound so breathy and yet, she did. Her body moved so in sync with Agatha’s; Rio was amazed at how good it all felt. Her hips rolled in time with Agatha’s thrusts. A strangled groan ripped from her throat as Agatha hit just the right spot inside her. Her eyes slammed shut before Agatha pulled back slightly.</p><p>“No, no,” Agatha cooed. “Keep them open. I want to see you.”</p><p>Rio complied, head going fuzzy and eyes half-lidded as Agatha pulled out more fully before bringing them together again. She could tell she was controlling herself and putting Rio first, which was something Rio deeply appreciated despite her inability to actually speak to Agatha and tell her that right at that very moment.</p><p>After a few more motions, Agatha stayed deep inside her, resuming her rocking motion once more, and bringing a hand down to Rio’s clit. She circled around it before pressing down and allowing Rio to grind on it with the motion of her hips.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio cried out, feeling herself on the precipice.</p><p>“I’m so close, darling,” Agatha replied. “I need you to come so I can pull out.”</p><p>“No.” Rio tightened the hold her legs had, firmly wrapped around Agatha. “You said-”</p><p>“I could give you a baby.”</p><p>“I want that.”</p><p>“Well…I want that too. But we’re not married.”</p><p>“We will be.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha tried once more, losing all conviction, knowing Rio felt how her cock was twitching inside her. “Are you sure? Are you positive?”</p><p>“Please,” Rio whined. “It probably won't even take the first time. Please,” she remembered the words Agatha had been saying to her throughout their appointments. “Come, Agatha. Come inside me.”</p><p>At that, Agatha lost all self-control. Her steady hips lost rhythm and she began to slam into Rio, who did not seem to mind one bit, slightly more forceful than before. Rio brought her own hand down atop Agatha’s and pressed, shamelessly grinding her clit into Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Agatha felt the telltale signs of her orgasm and cried out almost at the same time as Rio. Rio’s eyes finally did slam shut and she could feel spurts of cum inside her, Agatha moaning in her ear. For a few moments, neither could do more than groan aloud and chase their own pleasure.</p><p>For Agatha, it felt like she could finally die happy, having been deep inside the love of her life as Rio squeezed all around her. If someone had walked in on them now, Agatha highly doubted they would have been able to figure out where Agatha ended and Rio began.</p><p>Finally, Rio opened her eyes and pressed her palms against Agatha’s shoulders. “Can you…go again?”</p><p>Agatha felt her mouth go dry. “It’ll take me a moment, but yes. Why?”</p><p>“Why do you think?”</p><p>“You’re not sore?” Agatha questioned in disbelief.</p><p>Rio shrugged as best she could when pinned against the bed. “Perhaps I will be in the morning, but I’m not right now.”</p><p>“You want to stay here? With me?”</p><p>“If you’ll allow it.”</p><p>Agatha quickly nodded and pulled out of Rio in one fell swoop, causing the other woman to wince as she felt suddenly empty. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“No, it’s-” Rio cut herself off, thinking. “It felt nice. Having you inside me, I mean. My body got so used to it I forgot what it felt like not having you there.”</p><p>Agatha practically keeled over. “You can’t just say things like that.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because,” Agatha responded pitifully, feeling herself growing hard once more.</p><p>“Don’t you need to be hard in order for us to do this again?” Rio replied, catching on faster than Agatha expected. But, to be fair, Rio was also one of the smartest people she’d ever met. “Shouldn’t I say exactly those things?” Well, if anyone was going to immediately figure out what best worked for Agatha in the bedroom, it was Rio. “Shouldn’t you be using your hands while I speak to do so?”</p><p>“Why don’t you try to do it yourself?” Agatha managed to husk out.</p><p>She settled next to Rio, slightly askew on the bed. Agatha was slightly further up, her upper body using the pillows behind her to prop herself up, and she ran her hand up and down and up and down her length, using the combination of Rio’s juices and her own cum to make the process easier.</p><p>Rio rolled over more fully, staring directly at Agatha’s length. “Can I?”</p><p>Agatha smiled and nodded as Rio took over, following the same pattern Agatha had been. She’d also taken to swiping her thumb across the top of her cock occasionally, as Agatha quietly instructed her before fully relaxing into the pillows.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were fluttering shut and she felt herself grow harder and harder until she was close once more, but knew there was something more important to do. “My love, my love, Rio, stop, wait.”</p><p>Rio removed her hand as though she’d been burned. “Did I do something wrong?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied. “It just felt too good and I was scared I was going to…before we…”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, smiling wide before she placed a quick kiss on Agatha’s cheek. “So do you-”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha hissed out, helping Rio swing a leg over until she was straddling her lap. “Go as slow as you need to.”</p><p>But, after what she’d just experienced, Rio wasn’t in the mood for slow. She sank herself down, coming flush with Agatha’s body almost instantly, causing the other woman’s eyes to widen as she let out a guttural moan. “Rio.”</p><p>“Yes?” Rio whined, lifting herself up, pulling Agatha out almost all the way before slamming back down.</p><p>Agatha made a noise that sort of sounded like a pillow being punched. She gripped Rio’s hips tightly and just held her as Rio took charge. The sounds of their moans joined the obscene noises the slick of their bodies made as the bedpost rattled against the wall.</p><p>As Agatha tried to make sure her hips rose with Rio’s downward motion, she found herself sinking further and further into her own bed, Rio’s hand pushing down on her chest until she was nearly hunched over Agatha, eyes half-lidded once more, clearly chasing her own pleasure.</p><p>“That’s it, darling,” Agatha said, enjoying the view. Rio’s face was screwed with pleasure, moans ripping through her vocal cords, their chests coming into contact just often enough to provide a zing of pleasure every time their breasts brushed past each other, and Agatha knew there were a few minutes, maybe even seconds until she burst. “Take what you need.”</p><p>Rio sped up, lowering herself even more until Agatha was hitting some type of spot inside of her that was making her see stars. She began whining in Agatha’s ear once more, forearms now framing Agatha’s face, before turning and placing a messy kiss against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Rio, please,” Agatha begged. “I love you.”</p><p>And that was all Rio needed to hear in order to feel her body fully release, face falling forward against Agatha, moving near-habitually to extend her pleasure for as long as possible. After a few moments, or perhaps hours, she took in a deep breath, smelling sweat and sex and something so distinctly <i>Agatha</i>.</p><p>Rio nestled herself on her favorite person, tucking her head into Agatha’s neck while Agatha remained inside her.</p><p>“Did you…” Rio began, unsure what to ask.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, wrapping one arm around Rio’s lower back while the other traced patterns around her shoulder blades. “At this rate, I fear I might be dripping out of you.” Rio groaned but Agatha laughed harder. “It’s true! I am well and truly spent, my love.”</p><p>Rio let out a happy hum. “I like being your love.”</p><p>“I like being yours,” Agatha replied.</p><p>And together, they settled, warm, and nestled into each other.</p><p>
<b>Seven Years Later</b>
</p><p>“Nicholas!” Agatha called out through the open window, setting out three plates on their kitchen table. She knew her son would hear her, just as she knew his mother would <i>also</i> be trailing behind him, hands equally as dirty after an afternoon in their garden.</p><p>The house they had just moved into, a quaint home outside along the south coast of the country, had a large plot of land facing the kitchen, which Rio and Nicholas chose to cultivate as much as possible and as often as possible, especially in the summer months. Agatha was happy to see her wife and son spend so much time together, especially in the afternoons when she’d be working on some new patent or another and would hear their sweet laughter echoing up through her second-story office window.</p><p>Nicholas ran in first, sitting himself down before Agatha chided him. “Nicky, those hands. Go wash before we eat.”</p><p>The boy stood grumbling but did as he was told. Even at 4 years old, his eye rolls competed with Agatha’s and Agatha’s alone in terms of <i>most dramatic family member</i>.</p><p>A few seconds later, as Agatha stood at the stove, plating their meals, she felt a familiar body press against her back and warm arms snake around her front. “Hi, darling.”</p><p>“Mi vida,” Rio sighed. She didn’t speak her first language often, but a family of travelers had established themselves in town for a while and, once Rio realized they only spoke Spanish, she visited them near-daily, practicing words she’d seldom said since childhood, now making more of an effort to pass the language down to Nicholas as well. “Did you figure out the issue you were having?”</p><p>“Mmhm,” Agatha replied, putting the plate she was holding down and placing her hands atop Rio’s now-clean ones. “The vibrational patterns were all wrong. I realized that if it vibrates <i>before</i> it thumps, it will give the user a <i>much</i> better experience.”</p><p>“You’re so smart,” Rio murmured into the crook of her neck before placing a kiss there.</p><p>Agatha smiled, despite knowing Rio couldn’t see her and laced their fingers as she looked down, matching rings glinting in the golden hour glow.</p><p>True to her word, after one of the briefest courting periods that must have existed in all of London, Agatha found the most senile priest available and married Rio inside a tiny cathedral near Hyde Park. The only ones in attendance were Lilia (who sobbed the entire time), Alice, Jen, and Charon (who pretended not to cry and then pretended not to have had sex in the confessional following the ceremony), and Billy (who excitedly asked the confused priest if it was his first time marrying two women).</p><p>The group proceeded to have a picnic in the park where they cheered to the newlyweds and congratulated Agatha on achieving her first patent for a new personal massager all in one breath. Rio was full of bubbles, resting her head on Agatha’s chest, and giggling about something unimportant as Lilia approached them.</p><p>“Now,” she began, in a no-nonsense tone. “A toast, because I need to take a moment to thank you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha looked puzzled and Rio sat up slightly, confused with where her aunt was going.</p><p>“Since coming to live with me, Rio has been…a very rigid person,” Lilia continued, “Darling, I love you, but it’s true. She was never one for jokes or whimsy. Always following the rules to a perfect degree, even when they did not serve her. And I don’t know what buttons you pressed.”</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“Or how maybe your massager relaxed her.”</p><p>Agatha really tried to hold back her belly laugh.</p><p>“But since meeting you, Rio has become herself again. She is the free-spirited little girl I knew before her parents passed. And I want to thank you for touching her mind, body, and soul the way you do.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help it anymore, she laughed, playing it as though she were nervous and excited to be accepted by Lilia, Rio blushing furiously beside her.</p><p>“I appreciate the sentiment, Miss Calderu,” Agatha replied, leaning over to hug her as Rio buried her head in her hands.</p><p>That had been three years ago. And what was originally part honeymoon, part Agatha’s work trip to sell her new massager turned into a whirlwind of a tour around the continent as Agatha’s business <i>really</i> took off. Rio followed her wife everywhere and anywhere, often writing accounts of the various places they ate and drank and slept, and selling it to various publications back home for some spending money.</p><p>Naturally, she and Agatha also used their trips to determine where in the world would the sex be best. Rio argued that at home when she felt the most relaxed, was where she received the best orgasms. But Agatha always countered with an early summer evening in Paris that ended with the two of them falling asleep, still connected, and Agatha waking to Rio practically riding her until she came. Agatha would also offer up their time in Greece, where Nicholas was likely conceived.</p><p>If any of their friends or family were ever confused as to how their son came to be, neither woman would ever know. All they could prove was that Nicholas was a child of love and light who forced the two of them to slow down and appreciate what they had even more than before.</p><p>Becoming mothers convinced them to move to the coast. It convinced them to go into business together; Agatha would create the designs and patents and Rio would handle the description and actual sale of various devices to stores and apothecaries and beyond. And, in Agatha’s opinion, it also convinced Rio to rid herself of the rules she once followed and become more herself.</p><p>Her wife actually wore trousers on the days she gardened and Agatha thanked every deity she could possibly think of the first time she saw Rio in them.</p><p>Nicholas ran back into the kitchen, breaking the two of them out of the daze they often found themselves in when they cuddled. “Supper?” he asked Agatha before looking between the two and adding, “Hug?”</p><p>Rio bent down, leaving a lingering hand on Agatha’s waist as she picked Nicky up and returned to her position. Agatha turned around, enveloping the two people she most cared about in her arms. She could feel tears prick in her eyes as she held what she’d thought she would be unable to have for so long.</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha said against the top of Nicky’s head. Saying those three words was as easy as breathing and actually meaning them was something even more intuitive.</p><p>“I love you too,” Rio replied.</p><p>“Love you mostest,” Nicky chirped as well, making his mothers laugh as the family held onto each other for just a second longer. </p>
