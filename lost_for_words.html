<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio takes one last look at the boxes cluttering her apartment before turning to leave, groaning at the fact that she’ll have to unpack them all eventually. Her new apartment is perfect and she can’t wait to make it her own, but the idea of unpacking so many boxes is already giving her a headache. <em>Whatever. That’s a problem for future Rio. </em>She locks her door and makes her way to the elevator.</p><p>She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves once she’s inside. New town, new apartment, new job… she’s looking forward to finally putting the past five years behind her. A fresh start.</p><p>The drive to Westview High is only about ten minutes, she was lucky to find an apartment close by. Before she knows it, she’s sitting in her car trying to hype herself up to go in.</p><p>This year she’ll be teaching 10th grade biology along with 11th grade AP biology. It’s not like it’s her first year teaching, she’s been teaching for about five years now, so she doesn’t know why she’s so nervous. There’s not even any students yet, this week is just for teachers to get set up before school actually starts. It’s just a big change, is all.</p><p>She huffs out a breath and decides to rip the bandaid off. She quickly gets out of her car and grabs her bags before heading inside.</p><p>When she walks in the front door, an older woman sitting behind the counter smiles at her.</p><p>“Can I help you?” she asks</p><p>“Hi! Um, today’s my first day actually. My name is Rio Vidal.” Rio says with a smile.</p><p>“Oh yes! Hi! Right this way. I’ll bring you to the principal.” She rounds the counter and leads her down a hallway. “I’m Carla, by the way. Anything you need, I’ll just be in the front.” she says kindly. <em>Already way nicer than my other office ladies, wow.</em></p><p>They turn a corner and stop in front of a door that reads <em>Principal Davis</em>. Carla knocks and there’s a quiet, “Come in!” before she opens the door.</p><p>“Sharon, Ms. Vidal is here.” Carla tells her.</p><p>Sharon stands up behind her desk excitedly. “Ms. Vidal! Welcome! We’re so happy to have you here, let me show you around!”</p><p>She rounds her desk and motions for Rio to follow. “So, this is the A building, which contains the english, history, and art departments. And of course, this is the administrative wing.”</p><p>They leave through the big glass doors leading to the rest of the building. “English classrooms are on the bottom floor, history classrooms are down a bit farther, and upstairs is the entire art department along with the music room.” She opens a door that reads STAFF ONLY in big letters. “And this is the teacher’s lounge! You can find the fridge, microwave, coffee maker and things like that in here. There’s also a tv and space to relax, should you want a moment away from any kids.”</p><p>As she opens the door Rio spots a woman fighting with a coffee machine that looks older than herself.</p><p>“Oh! Perfect! Alice, this is our new hire, Ms. Vidal. This is our music teacher, Ms. Gulliver.” Sharon says with a smile.</p><p>Alice shoots her a bright smile as she walks over to shake Rio’s hand. “Please, Alice is fine. It’s nice to meet you! Are you new to town as well or just new to us?” she asks warmly.</p><p>“Both, actually,” Rio replies.</p><p>“Well, If you ever need anything, my room is just upstairs. My door is always open.”</p><p>Rio smiles at the kind offer. “Thank you. I appreciate it.”</p><p>She puts her lunch in the fridge and Sharon shows her the way out of the building, continuing their tour. “And this is B building, this is where you are! Science and math are downstairs, and all the electives are upstairs. Cooking, drama, languages, things like that. And here’s your room!”</p><p>She leads Rio to a door numbered 107, unlocks it, and is about to usher her inside when she spots another teacher to introduce her to.</p><p>“Jennifer!” she suddenly yells at a woman standing in front of the door next to them.</p><p>The woman turns and raises an eyebrow when her eyes land on Rio.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal, this is Ms. Kale, she teaches chemistry. Jen, this is Ms. Vidal, she’s new! She’s going to be teaching biology and she’ll be just next door to you.”</p><p>The woman steps up to her, looking skeptical, but shakes her hand anyway.</p><p>“Jennifer Kale,” she says in a bored tone.</p><p>“Rio Vidal. Nice to meet you.” Rio says with a friendly smile that isn't reciprocated.</p><p>“Mm,” is all Jennifer says before turning and walking into her room.</p><p>“Don’t mind her, she’s much nicer when you get to know her,” Sharon laughs.</p><p>Somehow, Rio doubts that.</p><p>They step into Rio’s room and she looks around, already appreciating how much bigger it is than her last school. She can’t wait to decorate and bring some life into it.</p><p>Sharon flips the pages of her clipboard and pulls out some papers for Rio. “Here’s a copy of the school year schedule and your class roster. There’s some other papers you’ll need, it’s all sent through email anyway, but I like to give physical copies as well. Feel free to decorate your room however you like! As long as it’s appropriate, of course.”</p><p>Just then, Sharon gets a message on her phone and looks worriedly up at Rio. “I’m sorry dear, it looks like i’ll have to cut the tour short. But you aren’t missing much, there’s the gym and the cafeteria and the sports fields out back, I’m sure you’ll get the lay of the land over time,” she says with an apologetic smile.</p><p>“That’s alright, no worries. Thank you so much, Principal Davis.”</p><p>“Oh, honey call me Sharon,” she says as she waves a hand in the air.</p><p>Rio nods with a smile. “In that case, call me Rio.”</p><p>“Alright. You get yourself settled and I’ll see you around.” Sharon says with one last smile before leaving.</p><p>Now alone, Rio looks around the room and smiles, a giddy feeling bubbling up in her chest. She takes a deep breath sets all her stuff down, feeling hopeful for the year ahead.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s the first day and Rio’s nerves are getting the better of her. The students will be arriving soon and as excited as she is to meet them, teenagers can be brutal if they don’t like you.</p><p>She looks around her room and double checks it’s appearance, from the wall decorations to all the plants she’s brought in. It sort of looks like an educational jungle… just what she wanted. She’s already planned out her lessons for the next couple weeks, so it should be smooth sailing. Today is just for them to get to know each other and what to expect from her class.</p><p>She’s just organizing the papers on her desk when there’s a knock on the door. A boy peeks his head in with a hesitant smile that brightens once he spots Rio behind her desk.</p><p>“Hi! Are you Ms. Vidal? Is this AP biology?” he asks.</p><p>“Yes! You’re in the right place,” she says with a warm smile.</p><p>“Nice! Hi, I’m Billy. Well, William, but I go by Billy.” He chuckles before adding, “Kaplan, that is.”</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you, Billy. Just take a seat anywhere.”</p><p>He takes a seat right in front, near her desk, and she smiles.</p><p>“So, you’re new right?” he asks excitedly.</p><p>“Yup. Today’s my official first day.”</p><p>“Cool. You're <em>so</em> gonna like it here!” he says, practically bouncing in his seat.</p><p><em>Wow, he’s definitely full of energy</em>, she thinks to herself.</p><p>“I’m sure I will, everyone seems really nice so far,” she replies.</p><p>The rest of her students begin to file in slowly. Once they’re all seated and the bell rings, she introduces herself.</p><p>“All right class! I’m Ms. Vidal and this is AP biology. Today’s class is just to go over our syllabus and get to know each other a little bit, yeah? No homework yet, don’t worry.”</p><p>The period goes smoothly, as do the rest of her 10th grade classes. Soon enough, it’s lunch time.</p><p>Feeling a little tired, she heads towards the teachers lounge to make herself a cup of coffee and grab her lunch. When she opens the door she immediately sees the bright red streaks in Alice’s hair. She’s sitting next to Jennifer and an older woman she hasn’t met yet.</p><p>Alice spots her at the same moment and waves her over. “Rio! Come sit with us! Can I call you Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s relieved not to have awkwardly find a place to sit by herself or go eat in her room alone. She chuckles, “Sure, and yeah, of course. Just let me grab my lunch.”</p><p>She gets her sandwich from the fridge and sets it next to them. She goes to pour some coffee into the mug she brought with her before sitting down.</p><p>As she sits down, Alice introduces her to the other two women. “Rio, this is Jen. Jen, Rio.”</p><p>“We’ve met.” Jen deadpans and stabs her salad with her fork.</p><p>“And this is Lilia! Best art teacher in Westview.” She winks at her with a smile.</p><p>“Flatterer,” Lilia chuckles. “Hello dear, it’s nice to meet you,” she directs towards Rio.</p><p>“So, how is your first day going?” Alice asks excitedly.</p><p>“Pretty good! The kids are sweet and everyone’s been very nice so far,” Rio says as she opens her sandwich.</p><p>“Clearly you haven’t met some people yet,” Jen snarks.</p><p>Alice rolls her eyes. “Don’t mind her, she’s just cranky today,” Alice whispers jokingly.</p><p>Jen sets her fork down and gives Alice a look, affronted. Lilia hides her smile behind her mug, Rio holds back a chuckle.</p><p>Alice quietly gives her the rundown on everyone else in the room and anybody else she might need to know about. Just then, the door swings open and a woman walks in, looking at her phone. Rio’s breath catches in her throat when she sees her and her sandwich stops halfway to her mouth. She can’t remember the last time she’s seen someone so beautiful.</p><p>The woman is wearing a blood red dress shirt with a black pencil skirt and Rio’s eyes follow her across the room as she grabs what looks like a salad from the fridge. Rio tries valiantly not to stare at her ass as she bends over. <em>She fails. </em></p><p>The woman tosses her hair over her shoulder and struts towards the door, only to be stopped by a rather pathetic looking man moving into her path. He seems to actually be shaking as he tries to speak to her. She looks incredibly irritated at the interruption and raises an eyebrow at him.</p><p>“S-sorry to bother you Ms. Harkness, b-but I was just h-hoping to maybe-” he stutters.</p><p>“Spit it out, Ralph,” she states impatiently.</p><p>“The list of books to be read this year. I was hoping to maybe switch-”</p><p>“No.”</p><p><em>No</em> is all she says as if that’s the end of the conversation, which it apparently is, because when he opens his mouth to speak she merely raises her eyebrows at him and he cowers. He backs out of her way and she continues on her way out the door. Rio is left breathless at the display of dominance.</p><p>As soon as the door closes behind her, Rio turns back to the table and asks, “Who the hell was that?”</p><p>Alice leans over the table slightly. “That was Agatha Harkness,” she says quietly.</p><p>“Why are you whispering?” Rio whispers back.</p><p>Alice pauses, seemingly trying to choose her words wisely. “She teaches 11th and 12th grade english. She's not exactly… the friendliest of people,” she says with a wince.</p><p>“A soulless bitch is more like it,” Jen mumbles under her breath before taking a bite of her salad.</p><p>Alice sighs, “She’s… not the easiest person to get along with. Her and Jen have this sort of feud or whatever.” She waves her hand in Jen’s direction and Jen scoffs. “She's also scary as hell, pretty much everyone is terrified of her. I really wouldn't get on her bad side if I were you. Especially being a newbie,” she warns.</p><p>Lilia rolls her eyes and chuckles, “Don’t listen to either of them, dear. She might be a bit prickly, but she’s not that bad once you get to know her.”</p><p>“Lilia’s only saying that because she’s one of like two people that Agatha likes.” Alice laughs. “I’d still be careful, though,” she says seriously.</p><p>“Okay…” Rio says nervously.</p><p>They finish their lunch together before they all head back to their rooms. As Rio is walking back to her class holding her now lukewarm cup of coffee, she’s still thinking about what Alice had said. She sounded so… <em>foreboding</em>. As if she was warning Rio not to go in some dark cave with a deadly monster lurking inside. <em>How bad could this woman be?</em></p><p>She can’t help it, her mind replays the moment she first laid eyes on her. <em>Agatha… </em>She can’t stop thinking about how <em>beautiful</em> she is. Even being incredibly rude to that man, she was still unfairly attractive. The energy that seemed to completely fill the space around her was intoxicating.</p><p><em>God, she is so pathetically gay.</em></p><p>Lost in her thoughts, she turns the corner and crashes directly into something. She realizes it’s not a something, but a <em>someone </em>as she hears a sharp gasp from in front of her. She looks down to see that her coffee has exploded over both their chests and, to Rio’s absolute horror, she slowly looks up into the eyes of Agatha Harkness herself. She immediately launches into an apology.</p><p>“Oh my god.. I am so sorry! I wasn’t looking where I was going. I.. oh god. I’m so sorry…”</p><p>Rio is at a loss for words. The obvious shock on Agatha’s face is wearing off, quickly being replaced with a look that would have grown men cowering in fear.</p><p>Even filled with unbridled rage directed solely at Rio herself, she can’t help but notice how incredibly <em>blue</em> her eyes are. <em>See.. pathetic.</em></p><p>She snaps out of it and realizes now is probably the time to fear for her life.</p><p>“<em>Sorry?</em> You’re <em>sorry?</em>” Agatha growls in a tone that sends a terrible chill down Rio’s spine. She’s standing there like an idiot with her mouth hanging open and Agatha practically screams,<em> “You absolute idiot!”</em></p><p>Her voice echoes down the hall. The few students that were near startle and scurry away when they see who exactly is shouting.</p><p>“You're lucky I don't have time for this!” she shouts in Rio’s face before stomping off, clearly in a hurry to get somewhere.</p><p>Rio stands there completely frozen even after she leaves. She glances around the hall and sees its now empty, everyone clearly not wanting to be in the danger zone when Agatha inevitably tore Rio to shreds. She swallows thickly before slowly making her way back to her room.</p><p>Once she’s inside, she leans against her door and drops her head back with a soft thud. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. So much for not getting on her bad side…</p><p> </p>

<p>“Well, it was nice knowing you,” Jen says mournfully when Rio tells her and Alice about the incident the next day at lunch. “We’ll make sure to send our condolences to your next of kin,” she deadpans while she pokes at her lunch with her fork.</p><p>Rio groans and drops her head to the table. “How bad is it really? Do I need to break my lease?” she mumbles with her head down and her shoulders slumped.</p><p>Jen chuckles, “You spilled your coffee all over the queen of holding grudges and making her enemies suffer. And you probably ruined whatever stupidly expensive designer shirt she was wearing. You might want to tell your parents you love them one last time. Just in case.”</p><p>Alice smacks her arm. “Dont listen to her. Agatha might.. definitely be those things, but shes not going to <em>actually</em> hurt you or anything. She might just be… ok yeah, she might be a little mean to you and make your work life a living hell for a while, but maybe you can smooth things over! You could try… talking to her? Maybe?” she trails off with a wince.</p><p>Rio sits up but smacks her hands over her face and rests her elbows on the table. She lets out a long, dramatic groan. Alice and Jen both chuckle. She leans her cheek on one hand and sighs dejectedly, looking down at her soggy sandwich.</p><p>Of course, that’s when the door bursts open and in walks Agatha, already looking irritated. When her eyes meet Rio’s she sends a glare her way that, in another life, could probably have turned someone to stone. She makes her way over to the coffee maker and pours herself a cup. Rio cant help but steal glances at her as she fixes it, adding two sugars and some creamer. Without a word, she turns and struts out of the room. Rio watches her go.</p><p>“Jesus Christ. If looks could kill…” Jen murmurs.</p><p>“Okay, maybe you should be worried.” Alice says, only partially joking. </p><p>Rio closes her eyes and lays her head back on her hand, not even hungry anymore.</p><p>During the next passing period, Rio is sulking at her desk when she hears the sharp <em>click, click, click</em> of heels coming down the hall. She doesn't think anything of it until she hears them enter her room. She looks up and immediately sits up straight when she sees Agatha stalking towards her with a steely look on her face. She doesn’t even have time to open her mouth before something soft hits her in the face.</p><p>“Dry clean <em>only</em>. Don't you <em>dare</em> take it to whatever disgusting laundromat you surely frequent,” Agatha says before turning on her heel and leaving the room as Rio sits there with another stupid look on her face.</p><p>She mentally smacks herself for looking like an idiot in front of her <em>again. </em>Why does her brain completely shut off any time she's near? She knows she should probably go and try to smooth things over with her, but she also knows there's a 95% chance she's just going to embarrass herself and make things worse.</p><p>Her students begin filing in. Her favorite student Hannah sits at her desk which is right in front of Rio’s, and looks at her with concern.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal.. are you alright? You look like someone just kicked you in the stomach.”</p><p>Rio laughs, “Just grown up problems.”</p><p>“Hey! I’m like basically grown up,” she says, pretending to be offended.</p><p>“Nuh uh,” Rio replies and sticks her tongue out at her childishly.</p><p>Hannah laughs and does it back.</p><p>She goes straight to the dry cleaners after work, drops off Agatha’s ridiculously soft shirt, and goes back home hoping to pass out early.</p><p><em>Jen was right, it does feel stupidly expensive.</em></p><p>When she opens her door, her cat Pudge is immediately rubbing against her ankles.</p><p>“Okay bud, let’s get you some food.”</p><p>She sets her bags down on the table by the door and picks him up, nuzzling her face into his neck. She inhales, his warm cat smell immediately relaxing her.</p><p>She carries him to the kitchen and opens a can of wet food, setting it on the counter for him to eat before walking to her room, stripping her shirt off as she goes.</p><p>When she gets to her room she takes off her pants and flops face first on the bed. She lets out a loud groan into her pillow.</p><p><em>What a great fucking clean slate this is turning out to be…</em></p><p>She feels pudge walk up her back and stretch out, settling in to sleep on top of her. She’s so tired, she just turns her head and drifts off to sleep like that. Pudge on her back and Agatha on her mind.</p><p>~</p><p>Two days later Rio picks up Agatha’s shirt from the dry cleaners. She’s somehow managed to avoid her since their last encounter.</p><p>She decides to stop by a little bakery on her way to school and order a coffee and a chocolate chip muffin for Agatha as a peace offering, hoping to clear the air between them.</p><p>She brings the coffee and muffin to her classroom before school starts, taking a deep breath to calm her nerves as she approaches the door. Her door is wide open, but Rio knocks on the doorframe anyway to be polite before slowly walking in.</p><p>Agatha is typing on her computer and when Rio knocks, she glances up and rolls her eyes when she sees her. “You better have my shirt,” is all she says as she continues to type.</p><p>Rio hesitantly approaches the desk, trying to fake the confidence she definitely doesn’t have at the moment.</p><p>“Yep! Got it right here. Very… stainless.”</p><p>She inwardly cringes at herself. <em>Why did she say that?! </em></p><p>Agatha merely points to the edge of her desk without looking away from her screen. Rio sets the shirt down and awkwardly clears her throat.</p><p>“Um, I uh… also brought you this. I didn’t know what you like so I just went with a classic.”</p><p>She sets the muffin down closer to Agatha and Agatha finally acknowledges her. She looks at the muffin and then arches an eyebrow as she slowly looks up at Rio. “And what is that?”</p><p>“A peace offering,” Rio says with a hopeful smile. “I wanted to apologize for the other day. I was hoping we could maybe start over… My name is Rio.”</p><p>Suddenly she frowns down at the muffin as a thought occurs to her, “Oh, I hope you’re not allergic to anything. Maybe the muffin was the wrong choice…” she murmurs to herself.</p><p>“I don’t want your peace offering, Ms. Vidal. Take it with you on your way out,” Agatha says slowly as if she’s speaking to a child. She turns back to her computer screen as if that ends the conversation.</p><p>Rio sighs. “Come on, I truly am sorry. I didn't crash into you on <em>purpose</em>.”</p><p>Agatha briefly closes her eyes and sighs, clearly irritated by Rio’s presence. She sits back in her chair and looks directly at her as Rio continues.</p><p>“I really don’t want there to be any sort of bad blood between us. I mean, I haven't even been here a week,” she awkwardly chuckles, trying to lighten the mood even a fraction. It doesn't work.</p><p>Agatha just continues to stare at her, looking annoyed. “Are you finished?”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth but she doesn't know what to say. “I–”</p><p>Agatha abruptly stands and cuts her off. “Listen closely, Ms. Vidal.” She places her hands on her desk and leans forward. “I don't want your peace offering. I don't want a goddamn olive branch. I have no interest in conversing with you in any way, shape, or form. We work in completely separate departments that don't even remotely overlap. There is no reason for me to ever speak to you and there is definitely no reason for you to be here bothering me. Take your muffin and get out.”</p><p>Rio gapes at her as she watches her sit back down and go back to her computer as if nothing happened. As if Rio isn’t standing right there.</p><p>She scoffs. “Believe it or not, <em>Ms. Harkness.</em> We still work at the same school and we’ll still be seeing each other around. You wouldn't have ran right into me if that wasn't the case.”</p><p>At that, Agatha snaps her eyes up to Rio. She clearly hit a nerve. Inwardly, Rio pats herself on the back for a moment.</p><p>“How <em>dare</em> you. You were th–” Agatha starts, but Rio cuts her off, now she's getting angry herself.</p><p>“I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt and not judge you based on what everyone else says about you, but clearly they're right. All I wanted was to clear the air between us, but you can't even refrain from being incredibly rude for one conversation." Agatha has stood up and she's leaning on the desk again. She's clearly getting angrier with every word out of Rio's mouth. She opens her mouth to probably rip Rio a new asshole but Rio raises her voice over her. “No. You know what? Screw you. Fine, I won't be civil either."</p><p>Rio glares at her as she turns and storms out of the room, ignoring whatever insults Agatha tries to throw at her on the way out.</p><p>~</p><p>“Can you believe that?! And I was being so nice!” Rio tells Alice as they have lunch in Alice’s room that day.</p><p>“Well, yes. Unfortunately that sounds exactly like something Agatha would say,” Alice chuckles.</p><p>“Ugh. Whatever. I’m not being nice to her ever again,” Rio huffs as she sits back in her chair, her meatball sub forgotten on the table.</p><p>She sits up suddenly. “UGH! And I left the muffin and coffee in there when I stormed out! She better not have eaten it!” Rio exclaims. Alice laughs loudly.</p><p>“I’m sure she threw them in the trash out of spite, don’t worry.” Alice chuckles.</p><p>Rio frowns. “Wait, that’s worse. I spent money on those,” she says dejectedly.</p><p>Alice throws her hands up in the air and laughs.</p><p>~</p><p>That night, she stops at a bar by her apartment to blow off some steam. It’s a little hole in the wall, so she’s hoping not to run into anybody from school.</p><p>She walks in and heads straight for the bar, sitting on a stool and setting her bag down next to her. The bartender is a pretty brunette covered in tattoos and she leans over the bar with a flirty smile to ask, “What can I get you, gorgeous?”</p><p>Rio is tempted to flirt back, she really is. And yet, as she stares into the bartenders blue eyes, all she can think of is Agatha.</p><p>“Whiskey neat, please.”</p><p><em>Why can’t she get her out of her head? She clearly has a type - rude and inconsiderate. Ugh.</em></p><p>As the bartender slides her the drink with another flirty smile, a man slides up next to her. She smells him before she sees him. He reeks of booze, clearly a little more than tipsy. He’s balding on the top of his head and he has a nasty smile on his face as he looks her up and down.</p><p>“Hey, beautiful. Can I buy you a drink?” He slurs.</p><p>She gives him a dirty look and bluntly states, “No.”</p><p>“Oh come on, we could have some fun,” he runs his fingers down her bicep.</p><p>She jerks away and spits, “Get the <em>fuck</em> away from me before I rip your <em>fucking</em> dick off. Since you can’t take no for an answer.”</p><p>He jerks back, “Fucking bitch,” he slurs before stumbling away.</p><p><em>Ugh, so much for blowing off steam. Now I just feel gross.</em></p><p>She downs her drink, orders another one and drinks it slightly slower, and then pays, tipping the bartender with a tense smile. Now she’s desperately looking forward to taking a shower and climbing into bed.</p><p>As she leaves, she sees the guy from earlier sloppily making out with some poor girl in a booth. He sees her and sends her a lecherous smile. She grimaces and keeps walking.</p><p>She falls asleep as soon as her head hits the pillow.</p><p> </p>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The first day of school always gives her a migraine, but today has to be the worst one out of all the years she’s been teaching. Not only did she forget to eat breakfast, but her mother called her this morning, which always ruins her entire week. Then her car wouldn’t start and she had to ask Wanda to carpool to school.</p><p>And now she has to deal with Ralph whimpering on about something she’s already told him no on a thousand times. He keeps trying to corner her to plead his case, but she’s not going to budge. The books in the curriculum were chosen for a reason, she’s certainly not changing it.</p><p>Not to mention, one of the students in her 11th grade english class is a real pain in her ass, giving her constant attitude about everything. It’s only the first day and she’s already acting out.</p><p>Although, she does have Billy Kaplan in her class again. She had him his freshman year when she was teaching 9th grade english and she can admit she does have a soft spot for him. His energetic personality combined with the fact that he’s never seemed to be afraid of her, had somehow gotten through her defenses.</p><p>She’s on her way to meet with the principal about her senior trip when she turns the corner and runs right into someone, feeling something explode all over her chest. She gasps in shock.</p><p>She looks up only to find the most beautiful brown eyes she’s ever seen staring back at her. <em>Wait, what? </em></p><p>She realizes there’s something soaking through her brand new shirt and her shock fades into anger. As she looks down to see the big brown stain, her anger only intensifies. She hears the woman start to babble out an apology.</p><p>“<em>Sorry</em>? You’re <em>sorry</em>?!” she growls. “You absolute idiot!”</p><p>She hears her voice echo down the hall and even though she knows this woman didn’t spill her coffee on her on <em>purpose</em>, she’s still pissed that she wasn’t watching where she was walking in the first place.</p><p>“You’re lucky I don’t have time for this!” she yells at her before stomping off towards Sharon’s office.</p><p>The first thing she says when she opens Sharon’s office door is, “That new woman… who is she.” Her tone is icy as she practically growls the question.</p><p>Sharon looks up at her, startled at the sudden intrusion. She looks down to the stain on her shirt in confusion but answers anyway. “Ms. Vidal? She’s our new biology teacher. …Is everything okay?” she asks hesitantly.</p><p>“No, Sharon. Everything is <em>not</em> okay. Do you see this?” She points at the stain on her shirt. “Your new hire is a bumbling idiot!” she exclaims angrily.</p><p>Sharon merely raises her hands in a placating gesture. “I’m sure she didn’t mean-”</p><p>“That’s not the point!” Agatha interrupts her. She suddenly deflates and sits in the chair across from Sharon’s desk with a huff. “Whatever, that’s not the reason I’m here. It’s about my trip.”</p><p>“Ah, yes.” Sharon sighs.</p><p>“You can’t take away my funding, Sharon. Please, the students love it every year.” Agatha pleads, sounding entirely unlike herself.</p><p>“Yes, I know. It’s just that Mr. Anderson makes a very good case for his trip as well, you see.” Sharon says awkwardly.</p><p>“He’s trying to use this trip for his own pleasure, Sharon. It’s just one of his stupid hobbies! The kids won’t care at all!”</p><p>“Well… he says it’s educational…”</p><p>“Educational! The seniors don’t want their senior trip to be <em>educational</em>, Sharon. They want to have <em>fun</em>.”</p><p>“Yes, I know. Nothing is decided yet, you may still get your trip,” Sharon tries to assure her but ultimately fails.</p><p>Agatha huffs and storms out of the room. She heads directly for her own classroom to change into the spare shirt she keeps in her desk.</p><p>She vents to Wanda about her day when she has lunch in her room later.</p><p>“She spilled her coffee all over me, Wanda. She ruined my favorite shirt!” she exclaims as she paces back and forth. “And now Sharon might give my senior trip funding to <em>Frank</em> of all people for his stupid abstract art museum because he’s claiming it’s educational for the kids. What senior wants to go to an abstract art museum instead of an amusement park?! That’s my money! And he's stealing it!”</p><p>She’s out of breath by the time she’s done with her rant. Wanda merely takes a bite of her salad and lets her finish.</p><p>When Agatha slumps into a chair near her desk, she offers, “Well, he hasn’t gotten the funding yet, so don’t give up.” She points her finger at Agatha. “As for the new girl, you know damn well she didn’t mean to spill that coffee on you, you should probably cut her some slack,” she tells her.</p><p>Agatha gives her a dirty look and she laughs. “As your best friend, those looks stopped scaring me a long time ago.” Agatha huffs.</p><p>Agatha replays the incident in her mind for the hundredth time. She remembers how brown her eyes were, how sweet her voice sounded.</p><p><em>No. She's not going down that road. Who cares how beautiful she was? The warmth that spread through her chest as their eyes met was from the coffee. Nothing else.</em></p><p>She needs snip these feelings at the root, before they have a chance to grow.</p><p>She storms into B building, looking for Rio’s classroom. She walks in and throws the stained shirt in her face and tells her dry clean only, not at all affected by the stupidly endearing look on her face. Nope.</p><p>Two days later she's sitting at her desk when she hears a knock on her doorframe. She looks up and immediately rolls her eyes when she sees who it is. “You better have my shirt,” is all she says as she continues creating her next lesson plan.</p><p>She hears Rio slowly approach her desk and mumble something about her shirt being stainless. She also says something about a muffin. Agatha looks up to see a to go cup and a chocolate chip muffin sitting on her desk.</p><p>The gesture warms her chest, and the feeling makes her decidedly uncomfortable. So she sticks with what she knows. “And what is that?” she asks, unamused.</p><p>“A peace offering…” the hopefully smile on Rio’s face does something to her, something she refuses to acknowledge.</p><p>Instead, she’s mean. She knows that she’s mean, she just can’t help it sometimes. She pushes Rio away before she can get any closer, it’s like her body can sense danger a mile away. And the feelings that Rio evokes in her are nothing but dangerous.</p><p>“I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt and not judge you based on what everyone else says about you, but clearly they’re right.”</p><p>Okay, she’s not going to lie, that one stung a bit. She knows what everyone says about her and she usually doesn’t care. It serves her well to have everyone be afraid of her, it usually means she gets what she wants. But to have it thrown in her face like that…</p><p>Rio storms out of her room, leaving her standing there, shocked at her audacity, adrenaline rushing through her veins. It’s not often she has someone stand up to her like that. It's was really quite exhilarating.</p><p>She huffs as she sits back in her seat. Once she’s calmed down, she glances over at the coffee and muffin that Rio left on her desk in her haste to storm out.</p><p>She didn’t have breakfast, okay? That’s why she eats it. And if the coffee was made exactly how she likes it, it doesn’t affect her at all. Not one bit.</p>

<p>A month goes by with no progress between them. Every time they pass each other in the halls or the teachers lounge, there's always scowls and glares and snarky remarks. They avoid each other when they can.</p><p>Alice and Rio become closer, even Jen warms up to her, and they become something of a little trio. Rio is complaining to them at lunch about Agatha once again, “She’s just so… ugh! So rude! She called me an incompetent idiot today. And I didn’t even do anything wrong!”</p><p>Alice and Jen share a look before Alice says, “You know, for someone you claim to hate, you sure do talk about her a lot.”</p><p>“I- oh shut up,” Rio grumbles. “She just gets on my nerves.”</p><p>“Mine too, and yet I don’t talk about her nearly as much as you do,” Jen says with a smirk.</p><p>Rio gapes at them before scowling. “You’re ganging up on me,” she huffs.</p><p>She finishes the last bite of her pasta and puts it away in her bag. “I’m outta here,” she says, sticking her tongue out at them.</p><p>They chuckle. As soon as Rio is out of earshot, Jen turns to Alice, “Fifty bucks says they get together by the end of the school year.”</p><p>Alice laughs, “You’re on.”</p><p>~</p><p>Rio’s almost to her classroom when one of her students comes running around the corner with a frightened look on her face.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal! Ms. Vidal!! Please come quick, I think Hannah’s having a panic attack. I don’t know what to do,” she says frantically.</p><p>Rio is immediately running after her, they turn the corner and see Hannah sitting curled up on the floor, her knees against her chest, with… <em>Agatha </em>kneeling in front of her.</p><p>As they approach, Rio hears Agatha speaking to her in a calm voice, trying to soothe her. She reaches up to gently pry Hannah’s hands out of the death grip they have on her hair.</p><p>“Hannah, listen to me. I need you to breathe, honey. Deep breaths. Breathe with me. <em>In… out… in… out…” </em>She says soothingly.</p><p>Rio is taken aback, seeing her be so gentle. She hasn’t witnessed her being anything other than incredibly rude and domineering since she started working here. Seeing her act so kind is kind of like a slap to the face.</p><p>Rio comes up to kneel beside them and puts her hand on Hannah’s shoulder, rubbing soothingly. “Hannah, honey, it’s okay. You’re alright,” she says calmly.</p><p>Hannah begins to calm down at hearing her voice and her breathing begins to even out. Agatha and Rio look at each other and, for once there is no hostility between them, only concern for Hannah’s wellbeing.</p><p>She finally calms down, tears running down her cheeks, she looks at them helplessly. “I-I’m sorry,” she whispers.</p><p>“No, honey. You have nothing to be sorry for,” Agatha says kindly as she tucks a piece of hair behind Hannah’s ear. “Do you want me to call your parents?” she gently asks her.</p><p>“No! I-I mean, no thank you. I’ll be fine,” she says frantically.</p><p>“How about you come hang out in my class during my free period? I’ll write you a note,” Rio tells her with a warm smile.</p><p>“Really?” she asks quietly.</p><p>“Yeah, we can even put on that movie you were telling me about. How does that sound?”</p><p>Hannah gives her a watery smile. “Yeah. Okay.”</p><p>Rio looks up to find Agatha watching her closely, she can't quite decipher the look on her face, but it’s definitely not one she’s ever seen Agatha direct at her before.</p><p>She helps Hannah stand up on shaky legs, “Thank you,” Hannah directs towards Agatha.</p><p>Agatha smiles warmly at her, “Of course, sweetheart. I’m just glad you’re okay.”</p><p>Agatha nods at Rio and Rio nods back before turning and walking Hannah back to her room.</p><p>When they’re inside she tells her, “If you want to talk about it, I’m always here to listen. Or we can put on that movie and just relax, whatever you need. Okay?”</p><p>Hannah begins to tear up again, “I- I just got a bad grade on my test. My mom is gonna be really pissed at me,” she says very quietly.</p><p>“Oh, honey, I’m sorry. It’s gonna be alright.”</p><p>She shakes her head but doesn’t say anything.</p><p>“Okay, what was that movie called again?” she asks with a small smile.</p><p>A small smile creeps up Hannah’s face. “You’ll really watch it?” she asks.</p><p>“Of course! You said it was cute.”</p><p>“It’s <em>so</em> cute! It’s called The Secret World of Arrietty. It’s a ghibli movie.”</p><p>“Ooh, I do love My Neighbor Totoro,” she says</p><p>She puts the movie up on the projector and presses play on her computer. They watch for her entire free period until the bell rings and Hannah has to go to her next class. <em>She’ll just grade at home later.</em></p><p>“Thank you, Ms. Vidal,” Hannah says sincerely as turns around. “Really, thank you.”</p><p>“Of course, Hannah,” she says with a warm smile.</p><p>You shouldn’t really pick favorites, but Hannah is probably her favorite student, always kind and incredibly witty. She’s also one of her brightest. But she’s a little worried about her situation at home, especially now. She thinks back to how Agatha handled her so gently and her chest warms.</p><p>Later that day goes to the lounge to pour herself a cup of coffee, only to find the room empty except for Agatha making her own cup at the counter. She pauses in the doorway for a moment just as Agatha looks over her shoulder and spots her. Agatha goes back to what she was doing and Rio walks up to the coffee machine.</p><p>After a minute of silence, Rio decides to try and breach the divide between them, even a little bit.</p><p>“Thank you for earlier, with Hannah,” she says without looking behind her.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat. “Yes, well… I didn’t do it for you,” she snarks.</p><p>Rio sighs, she doesn’t know why she bothered.</p><p>They’re quiet for another moment before Agatha finishes making her cup and turns to leave. Before she gets to the door she turns around and asks quietly, “How is she?”</p><p>Rio turns to look at her and softens a bit at the concern on Agatha’s face, “She’s alright, just needed some time to calm down.”</p><p>Agatha nods and leaves.</p><p>Okay, so maybe she isn’t a heartless monster like Rio was beginning to suspect. <em>I guess you really couldn’t be, in this profession. </em></p><p>But to be so kind and gentle… maybe Agatha is secretly… deep… <em>deep</em> down, a good person. Maybe the tough exterior she puts on is just to protect the softer side of her.</p><p><em>Ugh, this really isn’t helping my crush. </em></p><p>~</p><p>That friday is open house and Rio is very excited to show off how good her students are doing. Well, most of them, that is. And she’s looking forward to meeting parents as well.</p><p>“All right, guys, that’s all for today. Don’t forget tonight is open house! Bring your families, I’m looking forward to showing you guys off!” she grins at them.</p><p>People start arriving at about 6 pm. Hannah’s mom is one of the first to walk up to her.</p><p>“So. You’re my daughters favorite teacher?” she says haughtily. She seems like a very unpleasant person and Rio can tell from that sentence alone that she needs to tread carefully with her.</p><p>Rio looks behind her and sees Hannah standing there, blushing lightly and looking at the floor.</p><p>“Oh! Well if so, I’m honored to have the title. She just so happens to be my favorite student as well,” she whispers and jokingly speaks behind her hand. “But don’t tell the others.”</p><p>Hannah looks up at her and smiles, Rio winks at her.</p><p>She talks about how Hannah is the best in her class and her mother seems appeased. She meets a number of other people all wanting to hear about how good their kids are doing.</p><p>Just when she’s about to close up for the night, a woman comes rushing up to her door out of breath. “Wait! You’re Ms. Vidal, right? Sorry I’m late.”</p><p>“Yup that’s me.”</p><p>“My daughter Sarah has you for AP Bio,” she smiles. “My name is Natasha.”</p><p><em>Oh god, this is what she had been dreading all night.</em></p><p>Sarah is the one student she has that she just can’t seem to get through to no matter what. She doesn’t do her work, constantly disrupts class whenever she decides to show up, and just keeps insisting on acting out every chance she gets.</p><p>“Oh! Um, hi! Come in, come in.”</p><p>“So, how’s she doing?” Natasha asks once they sit down.</p><p>“Well, I won’t lie, she does have a problem turning in her work,” Rio says hesitantly. “When she does turn it in, though, she shows a lot of promise. I think she just needs to apply herself more.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s not surprising, she does have some behavioral issues. It’s okay, I know. We’re working on it,” she says with a small smile.</p><p>Her smile suddenly turns into something else as her eyes linger on Rio’s face. “She talks about you a lot though, says you’re a great teacher. Her favorite.”</p><p><em>She sounds almost… but no. She wouldn’t be flirting with me when we’re talking about her daughters behavioral issues… would she? </em></p><p>“Well, that’s always nice to hear.” Rio chuckles</p><p>“Were you heading out for the night? I don’t want to keep you.”</p><p>“Oh, well yeah, but I can stay if there’s anything else you’d like to discuss? I don’t mind.”</p><p>“No, no, I’ll let you go.” Natasha says as she waves a hand.</p><p>They walk out of the classroom together and Rio locks up. As she turns around to say goodbye, Natasha is standing a lot closer than she was before. She leans in closer and inhales.</p><p>“What perfume is that? You smell amazing,” she says flirtatiously.</p><p>Rio flounders, she opens her mouth but nothing comes out. “I-”</p><p>Natasha tilts her head and smiles at her.</p><p>“I um, don’t remember,” she chuckles awkwardly.</p><p>“Well, it suits you. I have to go, but I’ll see you around, yeah?”</p><p>“Uh- okay…” Rio says.</p><p>Natasha sends her one last flirty smile before turning and waking away.</p><hr/><p>Open house is always a nightmare, dealing with parents isn't exactly Agatha’s forte, especially when you have to tell them something about their child that they don’t want to hear.</p><p>Like Sarah for instance, having to tell her mom how much of a problem she is had been… unpleasant. Not because her mom fought her on it, but because she just didn’t seem to care.</p><p>Natasha introduced herself last, having said she was running late from work. Which was irritating, but fine. Except, when Agatha told her about Sarah causing so many problems in her class, she acted as if it’s not important at all.</p><p>“She has behavioral issues, we’re working on it,” Was all she said, with a flip of her hand. It irked Agatha to no end. This is a serious problem and it should be treated as such.</p><p>After Natasha leaves, with probably no plan to confront her daughter in any way, Agatha gathers her things and locks up.</p><p>She wanted to speak to Rio about Hannah’s mother and how she’s a bit worried about the way she treats her, so she makes her way to B building. She stops dead in her tracks when she sees Rio and Natasha standing outside her class, Natasha leaning in quite close to her.</p><p>She sees Rio’s blush from a mile away, the way she gets flustered at Natasha's proximity and whatever flirtatious comment she just threw at her, if the look on Natasha’s face is any indication.</p><p>A hot rush of anger washes over her. <em>How dare she flirt with a parent out in the middle of the hall? It’s incredibly inappropriate!</em></p><p>She sees the flirty smile that Natasha sends her and feels something solid settle in her gut like lead. <em>She needs to get out of here. Now.</em></p><p>She turns on her heel and storms out to her car, driving home quickly, stewing about what she saw the whole way home. Thinking about it leaves a sickly feeling in her stomach, she doesn’t want to acknowledge why.</p>

<p>Things between them are even more tense for the next few months. Agatha refrains from any snarky comments, choosing to just avoid Rio completely. Every time she looks at her, she sees Natasha leaning in close, Rio’s blush, and it makes her incredibly irritable for the rest of the day.</p><p>“What the hell is wrong with you lately? You seem more crabby than usual,” Wanda asks her when they’re eating lunch in her room one day.</p><p>Agatha shoots her a dirty look. “I’m not <em>crabby.</em>”</p><p>Wanda barks out a laugh.</p><p>Agatha realizes how that must’ve looked. Okay, so she’s a little crabby. So what? She’s always crabby.</p><p>“Come on, what’s wrong?” Wanda tries again.</p><p>“She just gets under my skin,” Agatha says quietly</p><p>“Rio?” Wanda asks knowingly, trying to suppress the small smile creeping up her face. Her best friend can be <em>so</em> oblivious sometimes.</p><p>“Ugh,” is all Agatha says, poking at her salad.</p><p>“I think she seems nice,” Wanda shrugs.</p><p>Agatha sends her another glare, continuing to push her food around. She’s suddenly not very hungry.</p><hr/><p>Rio and Jen are sitting at a table in the teachers lounge eating their lunch when Alice sits down across from them, leaning over to whisper dramatically, “I’d stay out of Agatha’s way today if I were you guys.”</p><p>“Why, what’d she do now?” Jen asks, unamused.</p><p>Alice shakes her head before continuing quietly with wide eyes, “She’s on the warpath. I only know it’s about her trip, I hear Frank is trying to steal her funding for his own.”</p><p>“Her trip?” Rio asks, confused.</p><p>“Every year, she plans the senior trip to the big amusement park about half an hour away. The students go crazy for it. And now Frank-Mr. Anderson. I don’t know if you’ve met him, he’s another art teacher. A real asshole. Anyway, he’s trying to get Sharon to give him Agatha’s trip money so he can take the kids to some stupid museum he’s obsessed with. He’s claiming it’ll be ‘extremely educational and beneficial for their cultural growth’ or whatever,” Alice rolls her eyes. “And Agatha is <em>piiiiissed</em>,” she says.</p><p>“An amusement park? That doesn’t seem very… Agatha,” Rio says skeptically.</p><p>Jen chuckles. “It’s not. But the kids love it, so,” she shrugs.</p><p>Rio thinks it’s sweet that she cares so much about the seniors getting their trip, even if it seems like it’s extremely out of Agatha’s comfort zone. She can't picture Agatha doing something fun like getting on a roller coaster. Like an alien riding a horse or something equally crazy.</p><p>During her free period she goes to Alice’s room to ask her if she might want to hit that bar up later, when she hears shouting coming from one of the art classrooms. As she gets closer, she realizes it’s Agatha that’s shouting.</p><p>She debates running for the hills to save her own ass, not wanting to anger Agatha further and have her yell at her for just existing, until she hears what she's yelling about.</p><p>“You can’t do this Frank! The kids don’t want to go to your stupid museum! That is my funding and my trip. <em>Back. Off.” </em>The way she growls the last two words sends a terrible chill down Rio’s spine.</p><p>She hears a man's voice start to yell, “I can do whatever the hell I damn well please! I’m not afraid of you like everyone else is. You can’t boss me around!”</p><p>Rio is immediately irritated. He shouldn’t be yelling at a woman that way, no matter how irritating said woman can be. She pushes the door the rest of the way open.</p><p>“Is everything okay?” she directs at Agatha.</p><p>“Oh, perfect,” Agatha rolls her eyes. “Why are <em>you</em> here?”</p><p>“I heard shouting…” Rio trails off as her eyes finally land on the man Agatha was speaking to. Her stomach drops as she recognizes him. <em>The creepy man from the bar. </em></p><p>His eyes widen as he recognizes her as well. She spots the ring on his finger and she feels a sick feeling of disgust roll through her body.</p><p>She walks further into the room and regards him with a blank face. “I don’t believe we've met. I’m Rio Vidal, the new biology teacher.”</p><p>Frank looks extremely uncomfortable as he clears his throat. “Nice to meet you. If you wouldn’t mind, we were speaking,” he gestures between himself and Agatha.</p><p>“Actually, you were shouting. Cussing at another teacher, to be exact. I heard you down the hall. You do realize this is a building full of children?” she tells him, her tone devoid of all emotion. She spots a picture of his family sitting on his desk.</p><p>He stutters, unable to think of a response. Agatha watches them both before Rio merely turns around, says “keep it down,” over her shoulder and leaves.</p><p>She doesn’t invite Alice to the bar that night, she goes back to her room to process what the hell just happened. Almost four months working here and she didn't know she worked with that sleezeball until now. She spends her free period coming up with a plan in her mind.</p><p>After school that day she waits until the students have left before she goes back up to Frank’s room. She walks in without knocking and he startles when he sees that it’s her. She casually strolls up to his desk and lazily turns the photo of his family around, picking it up. It’s a photo of him, his wife, and two little girls.</p><p>“How long have you been married, Frank?” she asks conversationally.</p><p>“None of your fucking business,” he spits.</p><p>Rio whistles. “That’s not very nice, Frank. Well, I’m asking anyway. How long?”</p><p>He pauses before replying through clenched teeth, “Twenty years.”</p><p>Rio gasps mockingly. “Wow, congratulations! She must really love you. And how old are your girls?” she asks with smile.</p><p>He glares up at her from behind his desk. “Twelve and thirteen.”</p><p>Rio hums. “What a happy family,” she says as she stares at the picture.</p><p>“What the fuck do you want?!” he angrily blurts out.</p><p>She flips the picture around and sets it facing him in the middle of his desk before looking him in the eye. “You’re gonna back off of Agatha’s trip,” she says seriously.</p><p>He scoffs. “You’re blackmailing me?!”</p><p>Rio tilts her head. “No. I’m merely telling you what's going to happen. You’re going to go to Sharon and tell her you don’t need the money. You’ve simply changed your mind… haven’t you, Frank?” she asks condescendingly.</p><p>He grits his teeth and clenches his fists on the desk. She waits patiently for a response.</p><p>“<em>Fine,”</em> he spits out.</p><p>Rio smiles widely. “Good. Great talking to you, Frank. Give your wife my regards.” She turns to leave, leaving Frank fuming behind his desk.</p><p>She knows he’ll follow through. Unless he wants her to spill about that night at the bar, which she’s guessing he probably doesn’t.</p><p><em>What a fucking pig.</em></p><hr/><p>Agatha just turns the corner, on her way to speak to Frank about the trip once again, when she sees Rio waltz right into his room without knocking. Her curiosity peaked, she looks back and forth to check that the hall is empty before sneaking up to the door. She listens through the opening.</p><p>“None of your fucking business,” she hears Frank spit out at her in a tone she’s never heard him use before. It sends adrenaline pumping through her veins.</p><p>She hears Rio ask about his marriage in a patronizing tone as he sounds more and more angry.</p><p>“What the fuck do you want?!” he barks at her, making Agatha jump.</p><p><em>What the hell are they talking about? What is Rio doing?</em></p><p>“You’re gonna back off of Agatha’s trip,” Agatha feels her blood run cold.</p><p><em>What the fuck is going on?!</em></p><p>She hears Frank scoff. “You’re blackmailing me?”</p><p>“No. I’m merely telling you what's going to happen. You’re going to go to Sharon and tell her you don’t need the money. You’ve simply changed your mind… haven’t you, Frank?”</p><p>Frank angrily says <em>fine</em> and Agatha release a breathe she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.</p><p>She couldn’t speak if she tried. She has no idea what the hell Rio has on him, or why she's using it to help <em>her</em> of all people. Especially after the way she’s treated her since she started working here.</p><p>She stands there in shock for a moment before she realizes Rio is walking towards the door. She rips off her heels and sprints down the hall in her stockings, hiding around the corner just in time. She peeks her head out and sees Rio walking the other way.</p><p>She slumps against the wall, trying to make sense of what just happened and she finds that she can’t. It doesn’t make any sense <em>at all</em>.</p><p>She can fight her own battles, she would’ve gotten that funding on her own. And yet, she’s incredibly touched that Rio would go out of her way to defend her like that. She feels a wave of warmth start in her chest and spread throughout her whole body. Rio <em>stood up for her</em>. <em>Nobody</em> stands up for her.</p><p>Later that night, she invites Wanda over to tell her what happened.</p><p>“She WHAT?!” Wanda exclaims as she sits forward on the couch.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha says as she paces back and forth in front of her tv, holding a glass of whiskey.</p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“So you got your funding?” Wanda asks.</p><p>“I.. I’m not sure. I don’t know when he’ll talk to Sharon, if he even will.”</p><p>“Sounds like he will,” Wanda mutters under her breath. “Why do you think she did it?”</p><p>“I haven’t the faintest idea! Why <em>would</em> she do it?!” Agatha huffs and sits down next to her on the couch. “She’s probably planning on holding it over my head. Watch.” She scowls.</p><p>“Or… she could just be a nice person,” Wanda tries.</p><p>“<em>Nobody</em> is that nice. Not with the way I’ve treated her.” Agatha shakes her head and sips her drink.</p><p>“Well, maybe you should ask her. Or I guess you’ll know if she comes to you first.”</p><p>Agatha hums and sips her drink, Rio and her stupidly beautiful brown eyes on her mind for the rest of the night.</p><p>~</p><p>The next day Sharon pulls her aside as she passes her in the hall.</p><p>“Oh! Agatha! Congratulations, you got your trip! Don’t worry about Frank, he said he changed his mind,” Sharon says with a kind smile.</p><p>Agatha stands there a bit dumbfounded for a moment. <em>So he really did go straight to Sharon. What does Rio have on him?!</em></p><p>Sharon leaves her be and she walks numbly back to her classroom, sitting behind her desk and staring at nothing in particular</p><p>Her students begin to file in and she snaps out of it. She teaches her class feeling decidedly light on her feet.</p><p>That day at lunch, she finds Wanda eating at a table in the teachers lounge… a few feet away from Rio and Alice.</p><p>Agatha walks up to the counter and pours herself a cup of coffee, grabs her lunch from the fridge, and sits next to Wanda, making sure to face Rio. As casually as she can, she tells Wanda about her conversation with Sharon.</p><p>“So… Sharon told me this morning that I’ve got my funding,” she says loud enough for Rio to hear, trying to subtly watch her for a reaction.</p><p>She doesn’t get one. Rio just continues to read the paper in her hand and sip her coffee.</p><p>“Wait, really?! Congratulations!” Wanda tells her, but Agatha can’t take her eyes off of the side of Rio’s face.</p><p>Wanda notices her trying not to be obvious but, very obviously, watching Rio and she smiles to herself.</p><p>If the lounge hadn’t been basically empty except for the four of them and a couple others on the couch, she would've thought that Rio hadn’t heard her. But she’s sure she did.</p><p><em>What is she playing at? Why doesn’t she want to take credit?</em></p><p>What Agatha doesn’t see, is the small smile Rio hides behind her coffee mug.</p>

<p>Christmas break is nearing and she can feel the anticipation in the air. Everyone is looking forward to the time off, students and teachers alike.</p><p>Rio just needs to get through parent-teacher conferences tonight and then it’s smooth sailing. Midterms are sure to be a breeze with how well her students are doing and then she’s free for two weeks.</p><p>Well, there <em>is</em> the staff Christmas party, she’s been told attendance is mandatory. She’s not exactly looking forward to it, but Alice insists she’s going to have fun.</p><p>Before that though, she has to get through tonight. She’s kind of nervous about seeing Natasha again, she’s hoping she doesn’t try and flirt with her.</p><p>Natasha, of course, <em>does</em>. In fact, she takes it as the perfect opportunity to flirt with her.</p><p>Rio looks up from her desk as she walks in, having waited her turn with all the other parents just outside.</p><p>Natasha walks in and takes a seat across from her with a flirty smile.</p><p>“We meet again,” she says.</p><p>Rio chuckles awkwardly. She opens her mouth to mention how Sarah is doing, when Natasha speaks again.</p><p>“I like that shirt, it looks good on you,” she says flirtatiously.</p><p>“I- um.. thank you. So… Sarah,” Rio tries to focus on the reason she’s there. They continue the meeting like normal, except for the looks Natasha keeps throwing her every so often.</p><p>“I’ll talk to her, I promise,” Natasha says as they wrap up their meeting. As they walk to the door she turns to Rio and says smoothly, “It was really nice seeing you again. Until next time.”</p><p>Rio closes the door behind her and slumps against it. She rests her head back and closes her eyes, taking a deep breath.</p><p>She’s flattered, truly. Natasha <em>is</em> a very beautiful woman, it’s just that her mind is kind of constantly occupied by someone else.</p><p>~</p><p>Midterms go well, just as she thought they would, and it’s the last day of school before break.</p><p>“Ugh, I’m so looking forward to this time off,” Alice says at lunch.</p><p>“Yeah, me too.”</p><p>“Are you excited for the party tonight?” she asks with a smirk. Rio gives her a look.</p><p>“You know damn well I’m not.”</p><p>“Well, you’re going, and we’re gonna have fun,” she says excitedly. “Right, Jen?”</p><p>Jen just shrugs. “Free booze.”</p><p>Rio pauses. “…True.”</p><p><em>Okay, maybe it won’t be so bad.</em></p><p>~</p><p>Later that evening Rio arrives at the party and makes a beeline for the drink table where she knows the punch will be spiked. The gym is completely decked out in Christmas decorations with a Christmas tree and everything, creating a cozy atmosphere.</p><p>She looks around as she sips her drink, looking for Alice or Jen, when her eyes land on Agatha speaking to Wanda. She’s wearing a black dress with long sleeves and a deep V neckline. Her hair is half pinned up with the rest falling in waves down her back. She looks even more beautiful than usual in the warm lighting. Rio’s breath catches in her throat.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Alice says from beside her. Rio hadn’t even heard her come up. Her head jerks to the side in surprise.</p><p>“I- I wasn’t- oh shut up,” she grumbles as Alice tries not to laugh.</p><p>She glances back at Agatha to find her already looking at her. She doesn’t glare like usual, merely stares for a moment before turning back to Wanda.</p><p>“Woah… no death glare?” Alice asks, a little shocked.</p><p>“Huh,” is all Rio manages.</p><p>“She must be warming up to you,” Alice nudges her shoulder with a smirk.</p><p>“Oh, please,” Rio rolls her eyes.</p><p>~</p><p>She bumps into Sharon at the snack table a while later, feeling a little tipsy from the punch.</p><p>“Oh! Rio, perfect timing, dear. Would you mind running to the supply closet and getting more napkins? I can't find any anywhere,” she asks.</p><p>“Yeah sure.”</p><p>She’s looking down at her phone when she runs straight into someone leaving the storage closet. She looks up to see Agatha holding the napkins she came to get, staring at her with wide eyes.</p><p>Her blood runs cold as she prepares for the verbal beating Agatha is about to give her for running into her <em>again</em>, but it never comes. Agatha merely clears her throat and looks off to the side.</p><p>“Sorry, I was just uh… coming to get some napkins…” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha holds up the ones in her hand and Rio nods awkwardly. They’re both quiet, neither making a move to leave.</p><p>“Um.. that’s a beautiful dress, you uh, you look great,” Rio says nervously, blushing slightly.</p><p><em>Why are you still standing here?! Leave!</em></p><p>Agatha just looks at her for a moment before quietly saying, “Thank you. You… look nice as well.”</p><p>Rio looks down at the red dress shirt and black pants she’s wearing and blushes harder. “Thanks,” she croaks.</p><p>When she looks back up she sees Agatha with her head tilted up, looking at something above them. She follows her gaze and spots a small sprig of mistletoe hanging above them.</p><p>She freezes. Her mouth drops open as she begins to panic.</p><p>“I- um.. we- we don’t… I mean, uh,” Rio stammers.</p><p>Before she can even get another word out, she feels Agatha press a chaste kiss on the corner of her lips. Her eyes go as wide as they possibly can as she stares at her, frozen in shock.</p><p>Agatha pulls back with a shy look. She clears her throat and her eyes dart around.</p><p>“Yes, well… I’m very… superstitious. Bad luck and all that,” Agatha says awkwardly.</p><p>She moves around Rio and goes back to the party with the napkins in hand. Rio is left standing there, staring into thin air, unable to move.</p><p>She doesn't know how long she stands there frozen, but once she finally moves, she doesn’t go back to the party. She numbly walks straight to her car and drives home, the feeling of Agatha’s lips on her own haunting her for the rest of the night.</p><hr/><p>She doesn’t know why she did it.</p><p>As she quickly walks back to the party, her fist clenched around the napkins so hard her knuckles turn white, she asks herself over and over.</p><p><em>Why did you do that? Why did you DO that?! Why the fuck did you do that!</em></p><p>She’s breathing hard as she enters the gym. She goes straight to the drink table to drop off the napkins before scanning the crowd for Wanda. She sees her across the room talking to Lilia and she’s immediately moving towards her. She doesn’t even say anything, merely grabs Wanda’s arm and drags her out of the gym.</p><p>She drags her all the way back to her classroom, resting her head on the door after she locks it and taking a deep breath.</p><p>“I just kissed Rio…” she says quietly.</p><p>“WHAT?!” Wanda shouts.</p><p>Agatha slowly turns to find a comical expression of shock on Wanda’s face. She cringes.</p><p>Wanda suddenly snaps out of it and shakes her head. “I’m sorry. I think I misheard. You couldn’t possibly have said what I think you just said.”</p><p>“I kissed Rio,” she says again.</p><p>Wanda’s jaw drops and she just stares at her for a moment.</p><p>“What the hell do you mean <em>you kissed Rio</em>?!”</p><p>“I-” Agatha sighs. “There was mistletoe in the supply closet and I- I just… did it.” She closes her eyes and slaps her hand over her forehead. “And then I mumbled something about being superstitious and left her standing there.”</p><p>Wanda barks out a laugh, doubling over as her laughter increases.</p><p>“Will you stop laughing! This isn’t funny,” Agatha whines.</p><p>Wanda wipes under her eyes as she gets her laughing under control. “I’m sorry. It's just… She’s used to glares and snarky comments from you and now you <em>kiss her</em>. I can only imagine the look on her face.”</p><p>Agatha winces. “She was quite shocked.”</p><p>A giggle escapes Wanda and Agatha sighs again. “I don’t know why I did it. I just… ugh.”</p><p>Wanda softens. “You like her.”</p><p>Agatha cringes but says nothing. She knows there’s no point in denying it. She just wishes she didn’t feel this way, especially about a coworker who she has to see so often. There’s no escaping her.</p><p><em>Not that you’d want to</em>, her traitorous brain tells her.</p>

<p>Rio replayed that moment under the mistletoe a million times over the break. Now it’s the first day back and she’s a nervous wreck. She doesn’t know if she wants to avoid Agatha forever or if she’s looking forward to seeing her.</p><p>She’s lost in her thoughts as she turns the corner to her classroom and bumps into.. <em>Agatha. Again! What is wrong with her?!</em></p><p>They collide quite harshly, Agatha dropping the book she was holding, and yet, she still doesn’t yell at her. She looks angry for a split second before <em>blushing</em> when she sees that it’s Rio who bumped into her.</p><p>She tucks her hair behind her ear in a very uncharacteristic fashion and clears her throat.</p><p>“You really make a habit of bumping into people, huh?” she chuckles.</p><p>Rio let's out a choked laugh and quickly bends down to pick up her book. She hands it over stiffly, her face on fire.</p><p>“Ha! Yeah, sorry,” she says too loudly.</p><p>“Well…” Agatha nods at her. She hesitates briefly before awkwardly stepping to the side and walking away.</p><p>Rio is left breathless at the interaction, not expecting it to happen so soon. She watches her walk away before snapping herself out of it and quickly making her way to her room.</p><p>Little did she know, Billy and Hannah witnessed the entire interaction, having prepared for Agatha to unleash her wrath on Rio like usual and not at all expecting what really happened.</p><p>“Oh my god! Did you see that!” Billy whisper-shouts.</p><p>“They were <em>blushing</em>! Blushing! Agatha Harkness herself just <em>blushed</em>. Oh my god…” Hannah says in shock.</p><p>“They’re totally in love, holy shit.”</p><p>“Do you think they know it, though?” Hannah asks with a smirk.</p><p>“Definitely not. I’m sure they’re both in denial. Talk about emotionally constipated.” Billy rolls his eyes.</p><p>“Aw, this is so cute though! They would make a beautiful couple,” she sighs.</p><p>“How much do you want to bet they’ll never admit their feelings, though.”</p><p>Hannah thinks about it with a frown. <em>Ms. Harkness doesn’t exactly seem like the most forthcoming with her emotions…</em> Billy suddenly turns to her with a mischievous smirk.</p><p>“What if we helped them?” he grins at her.</p><p>“Helped how?” she asks with a raised eyebrow. If they got caught meddling in their love lives, she’s sure Ms. Harkness would skin them alive.</p><p>“Just… give them a little push,” he shrugs.</p><p>She considers it for a moment before smiling back at him. “Alright, I’m in. What’s your plan?”</p><p>~</p><p>“Ms. Harkness?” Billy calls as he peeks his head in Agatha’s room during lunch that day, hoping to find her in there.</p><p>She looks up from the papers she was grading on her desk and raises an eyebrow at him over the rim of her glasses. “Yes?”</p><p>He bounces in the room like usual. “Can I eat lunch with you? Hannah doesn’t feel too good today.”</p><p>She sighs as if it’s the biggest imposition, when in reality he knows she enjoys his company. “I suppose.”</p><p>He sits down at the desk in front of her own and begins eating the sandwich he brought from home.</p><p>“Oh! I wanted to ask you something…” he says excitedly.</p><p>She looks up once again from the papers she had gone back to grading when he sat down. “Hm?”</p><p>“Would you… maybe want to come to my baseball game this Friday? My parents can’t come and I’d.. really love it if you could be there,” he says shyly, giving her his best puppy dog eyes.</p><p>She can only hold onto the stern look for a split second before she’s sighing. “I suppose I can stop by…” she says reluctantly.</p><p>He whoops from his seat and she rolls her eyes, a small smile pulling at the edge of her lips that she tries to hide.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. You’re lucky I don’t hate you.”</p><p>“Oh, please. I know I’m your favorite,” he says smugly.</p><p>She gives him the stink eye before going back to the papers on her desk. Inwardly, Billy is ecstatic. Step one of operation AgathaRio: complete.</p><p>~</p><p>He asks Rio to come to his game the same way and she, of course, says yes. <em>Step two: complete.</em></p><p>It’s game day and he’s in the dugout waiting for the game to start when he sees Agatha arrive and find a seat on the bleachers. He pulls his phone out from his bag and texts Hannah.</p><p align="right"><strong><em>The eagle has landed.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Gotcha!</em></strong></p><p>He sees Hannah take a seat next to her and he smiles. So far, the plan is going smoothly.</p><hr/><p>“Ms. Harkness! Hi! Do you mind if I sit with you?” Hannah says excitedly as she sidles up next to her.</p><p>Agatha looks up at her and sends her a hesitant smile. “Hello, Hannah. Sure, sit wherever you like.”</p><p>Hannah sits and immediately starts up some small talk. “Billy invited me too, I don’t know anyone else,” she smiles with a shrug. “It was nice of you to come! I know he’s gonna love it that you’re here. You’re like his favorite teacher ever.”</p><p>Agatha smiles softly at that. “That’s sweet.”</p><p>They game starts and while Agatha watches, Hannah watches the entrance, scanning for Rio.</p><p>When she sees her walking up to the bleachers, she excuses herself. “Excuse me, Ms. Harkness. I’m not feeling too well.” She bolts off the bleachers before Agatha has a chance to respond.</p><p>She “accidentally” runs straight into Rio.</p><p>“Woah! Oh, hey Hannah. Where are you rushing off to so fast, huh?” Rio says with a warm smile.</p><p>“Hey, Ms. Vidal! I’m so glad you could make it!” she says excitedly before wincing as if in pain. “Can you do me a favor? I was just sitting with Ms. Harkness, but I’m not feeling too well.. I think I need to go. Would you mind sitting with her? I feel bad leaving her all alone,” she asks.</p><p>“Oh, um, sure…” Rio says hesitantly, looking off into the bleachers. “Where is she sitting?”</p><p>“Oh just off to the right, towards the bottom,” she says, pointing in the right direction.</p><p>“Okay, uh, I hope you feel better.”</p><p>“Thanks, Ms. Vidal. I’ll see you around!”</p><p>She pulls out her phone to text Billy</p><p align="right"><strong><em>Next stage is in motion!</em></strong></p><hr/><p>Hannah asked her to, that’s why she's gonna do it. She doesn’t want Hannah to feel bad.</p><p>As she walks up to the bleachers and spots Agatha, her hair pulled up into a messy bun, looking as beautiful as ever, she’s overcome with nerves. She shakes her hands out and takes a deep breath.</p><p>“Hey, mind if I sit?” she asks Agatha shyly and watches her startle.</p><p>Agatha’s head shoots up and her eyes widen behind her sunglasses. “I- uh, sure.”</p><p>Rio sits next to her and they're quiet for a few minutes, before Rio can’t take it anymore and tries to break the silence.</p><p>“So, how was your break?”</p><p>Agatha looks at her from the corner of her eye before looking back to the field. “It was good. Time off is always nice. And yours?”</p><p>“Good! Just relaxed mostly. Unpacked the last of my boxes.”</p><p>Agatha nods and they fall back into silence. Rio suddenly remembers the popcorn she bought and pulls it out of her bag. She tilts the bag in Agatha’s direction as an offering.</p><p>Agatha looks between her and the bag before hesitantly taking some.</p><p>"You like baseball?" Rio asks.</p><p>"Not at all," Agatha deadpans and Rio huffs out a laugh.</p><p>"Why are you here, then?" </p><p>"My student invited me," she shrugs.</p><p>"Aww," Rio says and Agatha gives her a dirty look, although with no heat behind it this time. It's almost... <em>playful.</em> "Yeah, mine too."</p><p>They make small talk as they watch the game, Agatha even going so far as to <em>joke</em> with her. Rio tries to hide the giddy smile threatening to spread across her face the entire time.</p><p>~</p><p>Later that evening, Rio goes out with Alice and Jen and they take her to their favorite bar.</p><p>“What are we drinking?” Rio asks.</p><p>“Shots! Shots! Shots!” Alice chants.</p><p>“Oof, okay,” she chuckles.</p><p>The three of them get well past tipsy after a handful of shots each along with their individual drinks. Sometime later she tells them she has to pee.</p><p>In the bathroom, as she’s washing her hands, she hears the door open behind her.</p><p>“I thought that was you,” she hears someone slur behind her. She looks in the mirror to find none other than Natasha herself leaning against the bathroom door. “Funny running into you here,” she tries to say seductively but she ultimately just sounds drunk.</p><p>Rio smiles wide, always overly friendly when she drinks. “Hey! What are the chances?” she laughs.</p><p>“You look beautiful tonight,” Natasha says as she takes a step closer. “You look beautiful every time I see you.”</p><p>“Pssh, thanks,” Rio laughs and clumsily waves a hand in the air. “So do you!”</p><p>Natasha tilts her head and smiles. “You think so?” She’s wearing a short black dress with spaghetti straps that truly hugs her curves perfectly. Rio can definitely say she looks beautiful tonight.</p><p>As Rio looks her up and down and nods, her smile widens. Before she knows it, she’s standing right in front of her and bringing a hand up to toy with the bottom of her shirt.</p><p>“You know… I’ve wanted to kiss you since the first time I saw you,” she says.</p><p>“Real-?” Is all Rio gets out before Natasha is leaning in and kissing her firmly.</p><p>Rio freezes for a moment before she closes her eyes and lets herself be kissed. It’s sloppy due to both of them being drunk and not romantic in the slightest. Natasha pulls back with a smile after a moment, not having noticed that Rio didn’t kiss her back.</p><p>“Do you want to get out of here?” she asks breathlessly.</p><p>“I- I can’t leave my uh… my friends,” Rio stammers, incredibly flustered.</p><p>“Alright, you have my number. Call me sometime,” Natasha says before leaving the bathroom, giving her one last look from under her eyelashes.</p><p>Rio leans against the sink once she’s gone, breathing heavily. She’s incredibly flattered that someone as beautiful as Natasha would want her and she thought maybe she could give her a chance when she kissed her, but it just didn’t feel right.</p><p>A chaste kiss planted on the corner of her mouth made her feel more than kissing Natasha ever could. She can’t help but compare the two, and there’s no competition.</p><p>She feels an odd sense of disappointment, that the last lips to touch hers are now Natasha’s, and not Agatha’s. In her drunken state, she feels like she’s drowning in her emotions, in her feelings for Agatha.</p><p>She walks back out to the table, trying to pretend like everything is fine and she spends the rest of the night getting drunk with Alice and Jen.</p><p>Her last coherent thought of the night is, <em>shit, I’m in deeper than I thought.</em></p>

<p>It’s the Monday after she went out with Alice and Jen, the same night she made significant progress with Agatha at the game. It’s looking like they might even be able to be <em>friends</em>. She can't believe it.</p><p>She’s sitting at their usual table in the lounge, sipping her coffee when she whispers, careful of the other people in the room, “Oh, I forgot to tell you guys… I saw Natasha at the bar on Friday.”</p><p>“The mom who was flirting with you?” Jen asks.</p><p>Rio cringes. “Yeah, that’s her. She uh…” she lowers her voice, “She kissed me.”</p><p>“SHE KISSED YOU?!” Alice says way too loudly and Rio slaps a hand over her own forehead.</p><p>“Shh! Alice! Ugh!”</p><p>“Sorry, sorry. But oh my god!”</p><p>“Yeah…”</p><p>“Did you kiss her back?” Jen asks.</p><p>“I- I don’t know, I was drunk… Ugh things are going to be so awkward the next time I see her,” Rio whines.</p><p>What she doesn’t see, is Agatha go very still at the counter where she was just making a cup of coffee for herself.</p><hr/><p>She hears it all. The whole conversation, although they’re trying to whisper. And she feels her body freeze.</p><p><em>Natasha kissed her. She kissed her.</em></p><p>Her whole body feels tense and she feels a terrible burning sensation in her gut. Agatha feels like she’s suffocating under the weight of her jealousy. Yes, she can admit to herself now that that’s what this feeling is.</p><p>She pictures Natasha kissing her in some dirty bar bathroom, Rio reciprocating, and her fists clench around her mug so hard her knuckles turn white.</p><p>She stiffly walks back to the table where she was sitting with Wanda, only to find her already watching her, concerned. She shakes her head quickly and stabs her salad aggressively, trying to listen to the rest of their conversation.</p><p>“Are you going to kiss her again?!” Alice asks excitedly and Agatha wants to smack her upside the head.</p><p>“What! I- ugh. It’s not like that.” Rio says awkwardly, sounding incredibly flustered.</p><p><em>At least she didn’t say yes…</em></p><p>“It’s complicated,” Rio says and Agatha feels a ball of dread settle in her gut.</p><p><em>That’s not a no.</em></p><p>“Well I say you should, she’s hot as hell,” Jen says.</p><p>Agatha could kill her. She already hated the bitch, but now she’s crossed a line. Who cares if she has no clue the line even existed.</p><p>Agatha’s heard enough. She grabs her salad and calmly walks out of the room, trying not to give her true feelings away. She misses the way Rio’s eyes widen as she watches her walk out.</p><p>Wanda’s hot on her trail, following her all the way to her room.</p><p>“I heard. Are you okay?” she asks cautiously.</p><p>“I’m perfectly fine. Why wouldn’t I be?” Agatha says as she pretends to organize the papers on her desk.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“So she kissed that bitch?! What do I care!” she says a little hysterically. “I have no right to be jealous. I don’t <em>get</em> jealous, so don’t even say the word.”</p><p>“I didn’t..” Wanda raises her hands in a calming gesture.</p><p>Agatha slumps down in her chair and huffs. She’s quiet for a moment as she solemnly stares down at her desk.</p><p>“I’m jealous,” she says very quietly. “So jealous I can hardly breathe.”</p><p>“You really like her,” Wanda says. It’s a statement, not a question.</p><p>Agatha sighs heavily. “I wish I didn’t.”</p><p>“But you do… Maybe you should tell her.”</p><p>Agatha barks out a laugh. “Please! We’ve just recently started having civil conversations with each other, I can't just jump to confessing my feelings. Are you crazy?!”</p><p>“I think you’d be surprised. I’ve seen the way she looks at you sometimes.”</p><p>“You haven’t seen anything,” Agatha shakes her head.</p><p>Wanda sighs, knowing not to push.</p><p>~</p><p>Things between Agatha and Rio are a little more awkward since the baseball game. She’s been more reserved. It’s just that every time she sees Rio, she pictures her kissing Natasha, and it sends a sick feeling rocketing through her body.</p><p>She doesn’t know how to be around her.</p><p>Rio knocks on her door after school one day and peeks her head in.</p><p>“Hey, uh this might be totally none of my business but I just wanted to ask if everything was okay? You were acting a little strange earlier.”</p><p>She’s referring to earlier that day when Agatha saw Rio walking towards her, spun around on her feet to try and avoid her, and bumped into a pillar like an idiot. She’s sure it looked a little more than strange.</p><p>She’s touched that Rio would go out of her way to ask, although she still doesn’t know how to interact with her.</p><p>“I’m alright. Thank you for checking,” Agatha says stiffly.</p><p>“Are you sure…?”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“Alright,” Rio says reluctantly, knowing she shouldn’t push the subject, before brightening. “So the conference is coming up, any tips for me?”</p><p>“Go easy on the Matharitas, they hit you quick,” she deadpans.</p><p>Rio chuckles and stuffs her hands in her back pockets. “Got it. How do you usually like it?”</p><p>Agatha feels her face warm at the double entendre, even though she knows she didn’t mean it that way.</p><p>She clears her throat. “It’s fun. The panels not so much, but the party afterwards is always pretty enjoyable. Plus free drinks at the pool,” Agatha shrugs.</p><p>“Nice! I'm excited. I’ll see you there, yeah?”</p><p>Agatha merely nods. When Rio sends her a bright smile, although somewhat hesitant, she feels a wave of warmth wash over her.</p><p>~</p><p>That smile haunts her for the next few days. <em>She’s so sweet, and this is how I treat her</em>.</p><p>Wanting to make up for being so standoffish the past few days and wanting to get back to how things were at the game, maybe even better, Agatha goes to Rio’s room to ask her if she’d like to go get lunch with her.</p><p>She finally worked up the courage to extend this olive branch, she won’t be backing out now.</p><p>As she goes to knock on Rio’s door, she hears Alice’s voice through the crack in the door. She pauses with her fist only inches away.</p><p>“If you really like her, you should go for it.”</p><p>“Nothing can happen, Alice. It's probably against the rules, anyway,” Rio says dejectedly.</p><p>Agatha stumbles backwards, clutching her hand to her chest, before walking quickly down the hallway back to her classroom.</p><p>She feels a tear fall as she locks her door, the weight of her devastation threatening to consume her. She feels like something heavy has been laid upon her shoulders, her whole body sagging under the weight of it.</p><p>She slides down to the floor and puts her face in her hands.</p><p><em>How could she be so stupid? How could she think her and Rio could ever… No. Don’t even go there. She likes Natasha.</em></p><p>She wants to cry, but she knows she only has herself to blame. If only she hadn’t treated her so terribly, perhaps…</p><p>But no. It’s too late now, it doesn’t matter anyway. She just can’t let herself get any more attached. Pushing Rio away is the only option, the only way to protect herself.</p><p>Lunch forgotten, she sits on her floor trying to collect herself until the next bell rings.</p><hr/><p>“So, tell me why you <em>really</em> don’t want to give Natasha a chance,” Alice says as she takes a bite of her lunch.</p><p>“There’s just no spark. She doesn’t haunt my dreams, she doesn’t drive me crazy.”</p><p>“…This is about Agatha isn’t it?” Alice says knowingly.</p><p>Rio sighs. “She kissed me. At the Christmas party.”</p><p>Alice’s jaw drops comically and she drops her fork.</p><p>“There was mistletoe in the supply closet. She just… kissed me. And I haven’t been able to think of anything else since. It’s killing me, Alice,” she says.</p><p>Alice is quiet for a moment, taking in this new information.</p><p>“If you really like her, you should go for it.”</p><p>“Nothing can happen, Alice. It's probably against the rules, anyway,” Rio says dejectedly.</p><p>“It's definitely not. Trust me, I’ve checked,” Alice says distractedly as she pokes at her lunch.</p><p>Rio suddenly grins. “Oh? And why was that? For a certain chemistry teacher, perhaps?”</p><p>Alice blushes fiercely. “Shut up.”</p><p>Rio laughs, grateful to have the mood lightened.</p><p>“I see how you guys look at each other, you know. I’m surprised you haven’t jumped each others bones yet,” Rio chuckles.</p><p>Alice somehow blushes and even darker shade of red and closes her eyes. She slowly lowers her head to the table in front of her. “You’re going to be insufferable about this, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Oh, definitely.”</p><p>~</p><p>Later that day after school Rio sees Agatha in the hall and smiles at her.</p><p>“Hey! How's your day going?” she asks warmly.</p><p>Agatha gives her a cold stare and replies, “Fine," in an icy tone.</p><p>Rio is immediately taken back to their first couple days working together, when Agatha hated her guts.</p><p>She thought things were better. Especially after Billy’s baseball game. They had been talking like friends, or at the very least like acquaintances, but nothing like her demeanor now.</p><p>She stands there frozen as Agatha flips her hair over her shoulder and struts away without another word, or even a glance in her direction.</p><p>She feels disappointment and confusion rush through her veins and her heart feels incredibly heavy as she walks to her car.</p>

<p>“Okay, we're going to see a socially acceptable number of panels and speeches, and then we’re getting shitfaced,” Alice says from the front seat of Jen’s car. They decided to carpool to the conference.</p><p>Rio laughs from the backseat. “I’m down, but I also hear there’s a pool.”</p><p>“A stupidly nice one that we are definitely going in tomorrow,” Jen chimes in.</p><p>“It’s heated!” Alice says excitedly.</p><p>Rio smiles, excited for the mini vacation, even if she does have to do some learning.</p><p>When they arrive, Rio sees Agatha checking in with Wanda at the desk. Agatha looks up at her at the same time and Rio sends her a hesitant smile and a wave. Agatha’s face hardens and she snatches her room key off the desk, storming over to the elevators. Rio’s face crumples in disappointment.</p><p>“Yeesh. I thought she was being nice to you now?” Jen says.</p><p>“I… thought so too…” Rio says sadly. Suddenly, she’s not so excited for this trip.</p><p>They had made so much progress, what the hell <em>happened</em>? Did she do something?</p><p>She numbly walks up to the desk to check in before walking up to her room. She sets her bags down and sits on the bed, thinking.</p><p>She hates wondering if she’s done something wrong. If she did, she wishes Agatha would just come out and tell her. Now she’s going to have to corner her and ask because this hot and cold thing is killing her.</p><p>She has plenty of panels to see today, most are science related that she’ll be going to with Jen, but she has Personalized Learning scheduled last. It’s a generic panel for any subject, so she’s hoping Agatha will be there.</p><p>~</p><p>It’s been a long day of listening to people drone on and on and she can’t wait to just get back to her room and relax.</p><p>She’s just entered the Personalized Learning panel when she spots Alice and Jen already there, saving her a seat in the back. As she’s walking towards them, she sees Agatha sitting towards the front. She'd recognize that beautiful long hair anywhere.</p><p>She's distracted during the entire panel, her eyes continuously drifting back to Agatha’s head, watching her look down to take notes every so often.</p><p>When they’re done she doesn’t take her eyes off of Agatha as she watches her gather her things and get up to leave.</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” she distractedly whispers to Alice. She gets up and tries to cut through the crowd to get to Agatha but she’s too late. She sees her and Wanda leave through the double doors marked EXIT, but when she opens them and looks around, she’s lost them in the crowd.</p><p>She sighs, her shoulders slumping.</p><p>When she finds Alice and Jen again they tell her they're taking her to the hotel bar. Apparently that’s where everyone goes to wind down after listening to the panels all day.</p><p><em>Wind down</em> isn’t exactly the vibe Rio gets when they arrive. People are getting pretty wild when they enter the bar area.</p><p>The three of them find some seats at the bar and order their drinks. After about an hour, she’s ready for bed.</p><p>“Guys, I think I’m gonna head up to bed. I’m exhausted,” she tells them.</p><p>“Noooo,” Alice whines, clearly feeling the alcohol.</p><p>Jen is merely bobbing her head back and forth to the music with her eyes closed, seemingly as drunk as Alice.</p><p>Rio’s taken it easy, sipping her one drink for the past hour. With Agatha on her mind, she’s not really in the mood to party like they are, Alice and Jen having just taken their second shot.</p><p>She tells them goodbye and grabs her bag. When she rounds the corner, she sees Agatha coming down the hall towards her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen and she immediately ducks into the door next to her. Rio frowns and follows her. She opens the door to find Agatha standing in the middle of a large storage closet.</p><p>Agatha spins around with a panicked look.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing in here?” Rio asks.</p><p>“Um.. just… looking for the bathroom,” she winces at her terrible lie.</p><p>Rio steps in and closes the door behind her, blocking Agatha’s way out. She helplessly throws her hands out, palms up.</p><p>“Agatha… Did I do something to upset you? I- I thought things between us were better.. I <em>want</em> things to be better,” she says desperately.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opens and closes a few times but no words come out.</p><p>Rio continues, “At the baseball game, I- I mean.. things were good. And now things have gone back to how they were in the beginning… I just.. I don’t know what I did to make you hate me so much.”</p><p>“…I don’t hate you,” Agatha says quietly.</p><p>“Oh, please.” Rio rolls her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t!”</p><p>“Well you sure do act like it!”</p><p>“Because I like you too much!” Agatha shouts. Her eyes go wide and her mouth drops open, Rio’s doing the same.</p><p>“What?” Rio whispers.</p><p>“I- I didn’t..” Agatha stutters, flustered.</p><p>“You… like me?” Rio says softly.</p><p>“I…” she shakes her head, but ultimately gives up. Her shoulders slump and she’s closes her eyes. “…I like you,” she whispers. Expecting to be rejected and wanting to get ahead of it, she says, “But I- I know you like Natasha, okay. So I’m not expecting anythi-”</p><p>She doesn’t get to finish her sentence before Rio’s lips are on hers, Rio lunging at her and cupping the sides of her face to pull her in for a kiss. Agatha is frozen in shock for only a moment before she closes her eyes and melts into her.</p><p>She wraps her hands around Rio’s back and grips her shirt in her hands, pulling her closer. She licks Rio’s bottom lip, tilting her head to deepen the kiss when Rio opens for her. She feels her back hit the shelf behind her, the items on it rattling dangerously, threatening to fall off.</p><p>Their kiss goes on for what feels like forever, until they need to breathe. Rio pulls back, breathing harshly, and drops her hands to Agatha’s hips, Agatha bringing hers up to play with the hair at the nape of Rio’s neck.</p><p>Rio places soft kisses down Agatha’s chin, her jaw, down to her neck, lingering on the skin just below her ear. Agatha moans as she sucks the skin there, pulling her in by the back of her neck. Rio’s hands slide up Agatha’s shirt to feel her bare back.</p><p>Agatha feels herself getting carried away, she can’t catch her breath. Any more of this and she’ll be begging Rio to take her in this storage closet.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio whispers against her skin. She drags her lips up her cheek until their lips are touching. She softly brushes her nose against Agatha’s and smiles. “I like you too.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a breathless laugh and smiles widely, resting their foreheads together. She leans in for another kiss, humming against Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Rio’s licks into her mouth and Agatha moans loudly as she sucks on her tongue. Rio pulls back but doesn’t go far, whispering against her lips. “Come upstairs with me.”</p><p>Agatha nods immediately. “Yeah…”</p><p>Rio grabs her hand and drags her out of the closet, the metaphor not lost on Agatha.</p><p>She pulls her all the way to the elevator, pressing the button for her floor before pushing Agatha up against the wall and connecting their lips once again.</p><p>They’re kissing frantically until the elevator rings, signaling they’ve arrived on her floor. Agatha has to push her away to get her attention, laughing as Rio quickly pulls her down the hall.</p><p>Rio hastily tries to unlock the door, unable to focus as Agatha places gentle kisses up her neck, slipping her hands under her shirt and reaching around to rake her nails down her stomach. She finally gets it open and spins around, kissing Agatha hard and pulling her inside.</p><p>She immediately begins to lift Agatha’s shirt and Agatha breaks the kiss to rip it over her head. She lunges back at Rio, pulling her in for another kiss while pushing her backwards towards the bed as they both kick off their shoes. She pulls Rio’s shirt off before pushing her down until she falls on her back, immediately scooting backwards up the bed.</p><hr/><p>Agatha feels like her whole body is on fire in the best possible way. This isn’t how she expected her night to play out, but she’s beyond happy with the outcome.</p><p>She unclasps her bra and rips it off. As she climbs up Rio’s body, she leans down to kiss across her collarbone and chest and Rio arches for her. She reaches around to unclasp hers as well, peeling it off slowly.</p><p>She lowers her body on top of Rio’s and kisses her hard, moaning at the feeling of their chests pressed together. The skin to skin contact sending electric currents through her body.</p><p>Agatha pulls back and sits on her knees, bending down to kiss along the hem of Rio’s jeans. She drags her tongue up her happy trail, dipping it into her bellybutton as she unbuttons them.</p><p>She sits back on her heels as she tugs off Rio’s jeans, and then her own along with her underwear until she’s bare. She leans down and drags her lips up Rio’s thigh, placing soft kisses until she’s close enough to her covered pussy. She runs her nose up the center, reveling in the large wet spot there. She moans softly as she inhales her scent.</p><p>Rio’s chest is heaving as she watches from above. Agatha looks up and holds eye contact as she begins to peel her underwear down with her teeth, hooking her fingers under the hem to pull them down all the way.</p><p>She pulls both of Rio’s thighs over her shoulders, squeezing as she settles down on her stomach between them.</p><p>She licks the crease of her thigh teasingly, so close and yet so far from where Rio needs her and Rio makes a soft keening sound. Agatha doesn’t have it in her to tease this time, maybe later once she’s gotten her fix, so she dives right in.</p><p>She takes a broad lick up her center and moans at the taste of her, Rio moaning at the direct contact. Agatha slides her hands up Rio’s body until both of them are covering her breasts, squeezing and playing with her nipples.</p><p>She licks into her, all the way up to her clit, kissing it softly before taking it into her mouth and sucking. Rio let’s out a choked cry as she feels Agatha pull her into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha alternates between sucking hard and flicking her tongue back and forth. Rio’s hands cover hers on her breasts as she throws her head back, her thighs clamping over Agatha’s ears.</p><p>Agatha frees one hand and rakes her nails down Rio’s body, bringing her fingers down to her core. She places two of her fingers at her hole and looks up at her, her chin dripping.</p><p>“Fingers?” she asks.</p><p>“Yes! God yes,” Rio gasps, her eyes closed.</p><p>Agatha smiles and puts her mouth back on her clit, taking a long pull as she inserts one finger. She feels Rio gush over her hand and adds another, Rio letting out a scream of pleasure as she combines the two actions.</p><p>Rio comes faster than anticipated, Agatha playing with her g spot on every drag outwards. She comes with a scream as she suffocates Agatha with her thighs.</p><p><em>What a wonderful way to go…</em></p><p>Her thighs loosen around her head after a rather long orgasm and Agatha cleans her up, licking up every drop of her wetness she can find. Agatha slowly kisses up her body, pausing to suck on her nipple and grinning as Rio moans weakly.</p><p>Rio slowly reaches a hand up to tangle in her hair and pulls her in for a deep kiss, immediately licking into her mouth, tasting herself on her tongue.</p><p>She uses her other hand to reach around Agatha’s back and pull her down so her weight rests on her fully, sliding a thigh in between hers. She raises it, giving Agatha some much needed pressure right where she needs it and she moans loudly into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio says as Agatha places kisses down her neck, sucking on her pulse point. She cups the back of her neck and pulls her closer, closing her eyes.</p><p>“Hm?” Agatha hums distractedly, beginning to grind on her thigh, placing her own back in between Rio’s.</p><p>“What did you mean when you said you know I like Natasha?” she asks breathlessly.</p><p>Agatha immediately stops her movements at the mention of that woman. She pulls back with a frown. “Way to ruin the mood,” she pouts.</p><p>Rio chuckles and holds her tightly when she tries to roll off of her. “Seriously. What did you mean?”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “I heard you talking to Alice in your classroom. She said you really like her and you said you thought it was against the rules. Which it isn’t, by the way. Dating a parent of your student, I mean,” Agatha says as she looks anywhere but Rio’s face. “And I heard you in the lounge saying you kissed her.” She misses the way Rio gapes at her.</p><p>Rio is quiet for a moment, completely shocked at how wrong Agatha seems to have gotten things.</p><p>“Agatha!” She laughs. “Oh my god, you’ve gotten it so wrong.”</p><p>Agatha frowns down at her, a little put out that Rio is laughing at such a serious matter, but it’s hard to focus when their bodies are still pressed together so intimately.</p><p>Rio’s laughter dies down and she smiles up at Agatha so softly, it takes her breath away. She reaches up and tucks some hair behind her ear.</p><p>“We were talking about <em>you</em> that day in my classroom, and… dating a coworker. Not that I ever thought we could get this far,” she chuckles. “I really did think you hated me.”</p><p>Agatha’s face goes slack, her jaw dropping open. She’s speechless. “I… oh.” She feels herself blush fiercely.</p><p>“And Natasha did kiss me,” Rio says as she begins placing soft kisses across Agathas chin, then her cheek. “And yet, all I could think about was that kiss under the mistletoe, even with how brief it was. I didn’t kiss her back.” She kisses back to her lips and lays her head back down on the pillow.</p><p>“Oh,” is all Agatha says. She’s not usually this inarticulate, but her brain seems to have been turned to mush.</p><p>Rio grins up at her and traces her finger across her bottom lip. She raises her knee higher, putting more pressure on Agatha’s core, and Agatha moans helplessly.</p><p>“I hope there’s no more confusion on how I feel,” Rio says smoothly, a cheeky smirk on her lips.</p><p>Agatha lets out a breathless laugh and surges forward, kissing her firmly. She moans as she begins to grind down harder on Rio’s thigh.</p><p>Rio reaches down and spreads her folds so she can get more direct friction and Agatha breaks the kiss, letting out a cry.</p><p>“I want you to ride me,” Rio purrs against her parted lips.</p><p>Agatha makes a desperate sound in the back of her throat. “Yes, please…” she whispers.</p><p>Rio brings her fingers down to her core and pushes two in, meeting no resistance. Agatha lets out a filthy sound she's never heard herself make before. Rio adds a third and she throws her head back with a loud moan. She rests her hands on Rio’s breasts and sits up, pushing her fingers farther into herself.</p><p>She's slowly begins to move her hips back and forth, rocking into Rio’s hips, riding her fingers. As her hips pick up speed, the pleasure intensifies. She grips Rio’s breasts in her hands and Rio moans. Agatha opens her eyes at the sound and looks down to see Rio watching her with hooded eyes and blown pupils.</p><p>She holds intense eye contact as her hips continue to rut against her. Rio moves her thumb to rub over her clit in time with her thrusts and her face contorts in pleasure, still looking into her eyes.</p><p>“Fuck, don’t stop. I’m close,” Agatha says breathlessly. Rio grins up at her and brings a hand up to toy with her nipple.</p><p>The second Rio curls her fingers, she’s done for. She comes harder than she ever has before, gushing all over Rio’s hand. She lets out a desperate shriek as her body goes stiff, pleasure unlike anything she’s ever felt before setting her body alight.</p><p>She slumps against Rio as soon as she comes down from her high. She buries her head in her neck, her entire body feeling like a pile of goo. Rio brings a hand up to soothingly rub her back, placing soft kisses across her shoulder as she pulls out of her. Agatha lets out a weak grunt.</p><p>Agatha rolls off of her and lays on her side, their heads resting close together. Rio turns on her side to face her, running her fingers up her arm.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Agatha mutters into the pillow and Rio grins.</p><p>“Good?”</p><p>“Ugh,” Agatha grunts. Rio chuckles and Agatha smiles as she turns her head to face her.</p><p>They stare at each other for a moment, both smiling like fools, before Rio says, “Go out with me.”</p><p>Agatha’s face goes slack. “Like.. a date?” she asks shyly.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio smiles warmly, “Like a date.”</p><p>Agatha's smile slowly creeps up her face until she's grinning at her. She chuckles breathlessly and leans in for a gentle kiss. “I’d love to,” she whispers against her lips.</p><p>Agatha rolls her body on top of Rio’s, deepening the kiss. She slots her thigh in between Rio’s as she reaches down to squeeze her breast and Rio moans into her mouth.</p><p>They spend the rest of the night getting lost in each other, talking and giggling like fools in between rounds. They fall asleep in each others arms, a soft smile on Agatha’s face as she drifts off to sleep, feeling happier than she has in a long time.</p>

<p>Agatha wakes up feeling more rested than she has in a long time. As she comes to, she realizes there’s a body wrapped around her from behind. The memories of the previous night come flooding back to her and she smiles into her pillow.</p><p>Rio’s body is flush against her back, not a stitch of clothing between them. Her arm is draped over her waist, protectively cradling her stomach, and her face is buried her hair.</p><p>Agatha feels a rush of happiness start in her chest and flow outwards through her entire body, she can’t remember the last time she woke up in someone’s arms like this, the last time she even <em>wanted</em> to.</p><p>She's smiling to herself when she feels Rio stir behind her. Agatha panics for a moment, worried that she might wake up and say it was a mistake, that she didn’t really mean it. Rio must have felt the way her whole body tensed, because she nuzzles her nose into her neck and inhales, pulling her closer.</p><p>“Mm, good morning,” she mumbles into her neck, sending a chill down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>Agatha’s initial panic fades, and she feels nothing but warmth.</p><p>Rio begins placing soft kisses up the side of her neck and Agatha melts back into her. She feels Rio’s hand slide up to cup her breast before lightly toying with her nipple and she moans, goosebumps breaking out all across her body.</p><p>“Good morning,” she says breathlessly.</p><p>Rio tugs on her shoulder until she rolls onto her back. She kisses over her shoulder, up her neck, until she reaches her lips. Agatha moans as soon as Rio kisses her. Kissing has never affected her like this before, morning breath and all.</p><p>Rio moves so that she’s leaning over her and Agatha immediately wraps her arms and legs around her hips, pulling her down to rest her weight on her. When their cores meet, they moan into each others mouths.</p><p>Rio thrusts forwards and Agatha gasps, spreading her legs farther apart and throwing her head back. She lets out a breathless chuckle at how good it feels, <em>how intimate</em>.</p><p>They continue like that for a few minutes and as good as it feels, she needs more. Rio seems to read her mind because she pulls back and whispers in her ear, “I need to taste you.”</p><p>Agatha moans. “Yes,” she hisses.</p><p>Rio kisses down her body, pausing to give her nipples attention before she continues downwards. Agatha is breathing heavily as she watches her descend.</p><p>When she finally lowers her mouth to her pussy, Agatha’s eyes roll back in her head and she lets out a sound that’s half laugh-half moan.</p><p>They spend the next hour making each other come multiple times, before they get up and get ready for the day.</p><p>“I don’t want to leave,” Rio says as she sits on the bed and watches Agatha fix her makeup in the vanity mirror. Agatha smiles.</p><p>She turns around and walks up to her, standing in between her legs and tucking some hair behind her ear.</p><p>“We have panels to see, unfortunately.” Agatha says softly and Rio pouts. The sight warms Agatha’s chest. “Don’t worry,” she bends down until their lips are only centimeters away, “afterwards, I’m all yours.”</p><p>A filthy smile blooms on Rio’s face and Agatha chuckles. She places a lingering kiss on her lips before pulling back and wiping her lipstick off of Rio’s lips.</p><p>“Come find me later…” she says seductively before grabbing her bag and making her way to the door, swaying her hips. She turns around and finds Rio’s eyes lingering on her ass as she bites her lip. Rio slowly drags her eyes up her body and grins, Agatha chuckles. She can’t stop smiling as she leaves the room and she’s in a wonderful mood for the rest of the day.</p><p>“What’s got you looking so damn chipper?” Wanda asks her as they sit down for another panel together.</p><p>Agatha merely smiles at her. “Am I not allowed to be in a good mood?”</p><p>Wanda squints at her. “Oh my god. You totally got laid. Who was it?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw drops and she laughs before she gives in and says with a soft smile, “…Rio.”</p><p>Wanda immediately has the most comical expression of shock on her face as she jerks forward in her seat and Agatha can’t hold back her laughter.</p><p>“Oh.. my god… How the hell did that happen?!” Wanda whisper-shouts</p><p>Agatha shakes her head softly. “It’s a long story, but I’m glad it did. It was wonderful,” she sighs wistfully.</p><p>“Oh my god. You just sighed wistfully. Who are you!” Wanda giggles. “Okay, but really, I’m happy for you.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha smiles softly.</p><hr/><p>“I need to crawl in a hole and die,” Alice says miserably when Rio first sees her that morning. She looks a sickly green color, incredibly hungover, as she sits slumped over in a chair in between panels.</p><p>Jen walks up to them with sunglasses on, moving in slow motion and looking equally miserable. She looks at Alice and clears her throat, Alice blushing fiercely all of a sudden and looking anywhere but at Jen. Rio looks between them and her jaw slowly drops, her eyes widening.</p><p>Alice takes one look at her and cringes, she shakes her head slightly and Rio snaps out of it, putting on a blank expression. <em>We are so talking about this later</em>, she mouths when Jen has her forehead in her hand.</p><p>She clears her throat. “So, there’s been a new… development,” she says trying to hold back a smile and failing. They both look at her and she quietly says, “I uh… slept with Agatha… last night.”</p><p>Both of them freeze and they look so shocked, Rio barks out a laugh. “Are you gonna say anything?”</p><p>They both stay silent, not moving nor responding. It seems they’ve both completely malfunctioned at the news.</p><p>“Agatha <em>Ice Queen</em> Harkness? You had<em> sex</em> with her?!” Jen hisses quietly.</p><p>Rio frowns, “Hey. Don’t call her that.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Jen says disbelievingly.</p><p>Alice is still sitting there with her jaw gaping open and she suddenly snaps it shut. “Holy shit… Congratulations! That’s crazy!” she says excitedly before wincing and clutching her head.</p><p>“I believe a congratulations is in order for you two as well,” she mutters under her breath before grabbing her bag and running away. She catches a glimpse of Alice blushing profusely and Jen’s jaw hanging open and she laughs as she walks out the door.</p><p>~</p><p>She just finished her last panel of the day and she pulls out her phone to text Agatha when she realizes she doesn’t even have her number. She texts Alice instead and Alice tells her where to meet them for the party.</p><p>Apparently, there’s some huge party thrown in the banquet hall of the hotel, and it’s supposed to be the highlight of the weekend. She can almost guarantee Agatha will be there so she’s definitely going.</p><p>She finds Alice and Jen waiting for her outside the hall, standing incredibly close to each other with matching smiles, and she smiles to herself.</p><p>“Hey guys,” she says with a smug smirk on her face. They jerk away from each other and avoid eye contact.</p><p>Alice clears her throat, “Well, let’s go in! It’s already pretty packed so I’m not sure we’ll find a table.”</p><p>They head inside and are lucky enough to get a table towards the back just big enough for the three of them. Jen volunteers to go get drinks and as soon as she’s gone, Rio immediately turns to Alice.</p><p>“Oh my god!”</p><p>Alice lets out a long dramatic whine. “Shut uuuup.” She hides her face in her hands as Rio laughs loudly.</p><p>“Oh come on, you guys are so cute! I’m happy for you! Look at us, all getting laid,” she says with another laugh, this time Alice joins in.</p><p>She sees Agatha walk in with Wanda and Lilia, wearing a white dress shirt tucked into slacks that hug her curves deliciously. Rio feels her mouth water.</p><p>Wanda and Lilia go grab a table and Agatha heads to the bar. Rio turns to Alice and says, “I’ll… be right back,” before getting up and making her way through the crowd. Alice rolls her eyes with a smile when she sees where she’s heading.</p><p>“Boo,” Rio says huskily in Agatha’s ear as she sneaks up behind her. She slides up to Agatha’s left side, facing her and leaning her hip on the bar.</p><p>Agatha turns her head when she hears her, her body following suit a moment later as a smirk creeps up her face. “Hello,” she murmurs, staring at Rio’s lips and Rio grins.</p><p>“How was your day?” Rio asks her as she sips her drink. The bartender comes over and places one in front of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha smiles. “It was good. I was quite distracted all day, though,” she says as she glances down at her drink before looking up at Rio through her eyelashes, her smile turning into a filthy smirk.</p><p>“Oh? Distracted by what exactly?” Rio asks with raised eyebrows and a big smile.</p><p>Agatha tilts her head and takes a step closer, bring a hand up to draw patterns on Rio’s stomach. “Lots of things. Your tongue, mostly.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes drop to her lips and she hums. “Mm. I know what you mean.” She leans in close to whisper in her ear, “I can still taste you on my tongue.” She hears Agatha gasp softly.</p><p>As she pulls back, Agatha stares at Rio’s lips before slowly trailing her eyes down her neck, her breasts, and down to her stomach where she’s playing with her shirt. Rio feels her body go hot under her gaze. “I think.. I’d rather take this party upstairs,” Agatha says lowly, inches away from her face.</p><p>“Hey there!” Wanda says, coming up behind Agatha. “You were taking way too long to get drinks, but now I see why,” she says with a cheeky smile.</p><p>Agatha hangs her head and closes her eyes. She huffs out a laugh. “Rio, this is Wanda. Wanda, Rio. I don’t believe you’ve properly met, yet.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Rio. I’ve heard <em>so</em> much about you,” Wanda grins as she sticks out her hand.</p><p>Agatha sends her a glare as Rio’s eyebrows raise. “Oh, really?” she says, glancing at Agatha with a smug smile as she takes Wanda’s hand. Agatha closes her eyes and lets out a disbelieving laugh.</p><p>“Go get your drinks,” she tells Wanda as she smacks her arm.</p><p>Wanda laughs as she walks away. “Nice meeting you! Officially!” she yells and Rio sends her a wave.</p><p>“You talked about me?” she immediately asks Agatha, smirk still plastered on her face.</p><p>“Ugh. You’re going to be insufferable about that, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio takes a step closer and leans toward her, staring at her lips. “Definitely. But I’m not exactly one to talk. Alice will tell you, I’ve been quite annoying about my big pathetic crush on you.” She laughs.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t laugh with her, she just stares at her lips with hooded eyes. Apparently, that seemed to do it for her. She grabs Rio’s hand and drags her out of the party without another word.</p><p>Rio makes eye contact with Alice across the room, Alice grins at her and gives her a goofy thumbs up. Rio laughs happily and lets herself be dragged out of the banquet hall.</p><p>Rio places her hands on Agatha’s hips and her chin on her shoulder as they stop in front of the elevator and press the button. When it dings and they rush inside, Rio presses the button for her floor and pushes Agatha against the wall again.</p><p>She kisses her deeply, immediately licking into her mouth as her hands run down her hips to grab her ass. Agatha moans and hooks her right leg over Rio’s hip. Rio slides her left hand down her thigh and then back up to her ass, squeezing again and pulling her against her.</p><p>They rush out of the elevator stealing kisses down the hallway until they stop in front of Rio’s room. Agatha flips Rio around, pushes her hips against the door, and kisses her again. She slides her hand around and reaches into her back pocket, squeezing her ass before pulling out her keycard and unlocking the door.</p><p>Once they’re inside, they undress each other as quickly as possible until they’re in just their underwear and Rio flips them around. She pushes Agatha down on the bed and straddles her hips. She pins her arms above her head, interlaces their fingers, and grins down at her.</p><p>“God, I wish I had my strap,” Rio rasps against her lips.</p><p>Agatha moans loudly and closes her eyes. “Fuck. As soon as we get home.”</p><p>Rio leans down and connects their lips in a passionate kiss, Agatha arching beneath her. She tries to move her hands out of Rio’s grip but she tightens her hold and Agatha whines.</p><p>“Please, Rio. Touch me,” she gasps.</p><p>“Are you going to be good for me?” Rio asks smugly.</p><p>“Yes,” she hisses. “Please.”</p><p>Rio kisses her deeply before pulling back slightly. “God, I love hearing you beg,” she says as she sits back on Agatha’s hips.</p><p>She releases her hands and bends down to take a nipple in her mouth. Agatha cries out in pleasure as she sucks on it.</p><p>She kisses down her stomach, pausing to suck the sensitive skin under her breast until a hickey forms. She licks around her bellybutton and down to her underwear.</p><p>In a teasing mood, she lightly rubs her thumb over the wet spot in the center of her panties. Agatha huffs and squirms on the bed.</p><p>“Take them off,” she pleads and Rio smirks at her. She slowly peels them off, much too slowly for Agatha’s liking before she eventually takes them off and tosses them over her shoulder.</p><p>She bites her knee before placing slow kisses up her thigh, leaving hickeys as she goes. She pulls back and looks at the marks she made with a smug smile. Agatha sees and chuckles above her.</p><p>When Rio takes a slow lick up the center of her pussy, Agatha slaps a hand down on the bed and lets out a choked sound.</p><p>“Wait…” she says breathlessly, “Come up here.”</p><p>Rio looks up at her and obeys, placing sloppy kisses up her body as she goes. When she gets to her lips she kisses her deeply and Agatha giggles against her lips.</p><p>“Turn around,” Agatha says.</p><p>Rio stares at her for a moment before she grins. She sits up and slowly peels off her underwear before climbing up the bed until she’s kneeling next to Agatha’s face, then she swings a leg over her head and arches her back, placing her hands on Agatha’s stomach. She lowers herself down until Agatha’s mouth makes contact with her pussy, moaning when she immediately licks into her.</p><p>She leans down and takes Agatha’s clit into her mouth, sucking on it gently. Agatha moans into her and grabs her ass with both hands, pulling her further onto her face. She follows Rio’s lead and takes her clit in her mouth.</p><p>Rio wraps her hands around Agatha’s thighs and pulls them up around her head, wanting to feel them wrapped around her as she pushes her face as far into Agatha's pussy as she can.</p><p>She sticks her tongue inside her and Agatha moans loudly, gripping her ass harder and doing the same.</p><p>One more suck to her clit, Agatha flicking her tongue back and forth, and Rio comes with a shout. She shakes on top of her, her whole body tensing up as she gushes into Agatha’s mouth. She immediately goes back to Agatha, making her come after adding her fingers to the mix. The constant pressure on her clit making her cry out as she does.</p><p>Rio rolls off of her and they both lay there trying to collect themselves after their powerful orgasms.</p><p>“Wow,” Rio croaks.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha laughs.</p><p>Her laughter persists, the euphoria she just experienced still flowing through her veins, making her feel absolutely giddy. Rio sits up and grins, she starts to laugh along with her as she flips around and lays down next to her. When their laughter dies down, they’re left with big smiles on their faces. Agatha leans in and kisses her sweetly.</p><p>Rio could <em>really </em>get used to this. The thought suddenly terrifies her.</p>

<p>Rio falls asleep wrapped around Agatha feeling conflicted.</p><p>She can’t remember the last time she was this happy, certainly not in her last relationship, but it’s <em>because</em> of that relationship that she's nervous. She can’t go through that again… and putting herself out there like this is taking the chance that she might.</p><p><em>No, this will be different… Agatha is different</em>, she tells herself over and over to calm her nerves.</p><p>They wake up Sunday morning and reluctantly part ways, comforted by the fact they’ll see each other on Monday. There are lots of kisses and touching that almost goes too far, but they’re already late for checkout and they have no time to get lost in each other again.</p><p>“Wait! I don’t even have your phone number,” Rio blurts out as Agatha is about to leave her room.</p><p>Agatha comes over and stands in between Rio’s legs where she sits on the bed. She grabs her phone out of her hand and puts her number in under her full name and Rio smiles at how formal it is.</p><p>Agatha bends down to place one last lingering kiss on her lips before leaving. As soon as she’s gone, Rio immediately changes her name to just Agatha with a purple heart and texts her so she has her number too.</p><p>~</p><p>Rio walks into school on Monday with a spring in her step. She enters the teachers lounge with a smile on her face and goes straight to the coffee machine.</p><p>“Gooood morning,” she sing songs.</p><p>“Someone’s happy,” Alice says with a smirk.</p><p>“Looks like that makes two of us,” Rio replies with raised eyebrow and Alice grins.</p><p>“Yes it does.”</p><p>Just then, Wanda walks in with Agatha following behind her. Rio’s heart does a pathetic little jump at the sight of her and she tries to stifle the smile that’s threatening to break her face in half.</p><p>Agatha scans the room and smiles coyly when her eyes land on her. She pours her own cup of coffee and sits at her table with Wanda, facing Rio. She holds eye contact over the rim of her mug as she takes a sip. Rio feels herself blush.</p><p>When everyone starts to leave the lounge, Rio hangs back, watching as Agatha makes no move to get up from her table until it’s just the two of them.</p><p>She slowly walks over to Rio and kicks one of her ankles out until she can stand in the space between her legs. She slides her hands over Rio’s shoulders to cup the back of her neck and play with her hair. Rio’s hands slide up the back of her bare thighs, under the hem of the skirt she’s wearing and she looks up at her.</p><p>Agatha smiles down at her and gently tucks some hair behind her ear. “Good morning,” she says softly.</p><p>Rio grins up at her and squeezes the back of her thighs right above her knees. “A very good morning.”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip before leaning down and kissing her, pulling back after just a second and Rio makes a sound of protest in her throat. Agatha chuckles.</p><p>“We need to get to class, darling,” Agatha tells her.</p><p>The pout on Rio’s face immediately morphs into a bright smile. “Darling.. I like that.” She raises her hands further up Agatha’s skirt.</p><p>Agatha huffs out a laugh. “Good.”</p><p>Once again, they reluctantly part ways with another soft kiss goodbye, promising to see each other soon.</p><hr/><p>Billy slams his bag down next to Hannah at lunch.</p><p>“Oh my god! Have you seen them today?! They might as well write I’M IN LOVE across their foreheads!” he says with a wide grin as he sits down.</p><p>“Seriously, oh my god. Jacob interrupted class again today and Ms. Harkness <em>laughed</em> at his joke. She <em>laughed</em>!” Hannah says with wide eyes.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal isn’t any better, she’s practically floating around on a cloud,” he laughs.</p><p>Hannah sighs wistfully. “They are so cute.”</p><p>Billy smiles smugly. “We totally did that, we should tell them one day. How do we get invited to their wedding?” Hannah laughs</p><hr/><p>The next few days are full of stolen kisses and cute messages exchanged in between classes.</p><p>“Hey, beautiful,” Rio says as she knocks on Agatha’s door a few days later during the passing period.</p><p>Agatha looks up at Rio over the rim of her glasses and a smile blooms on her face. Those glasses do something crazy to Rio’s stomach every time she sees them. She blushes profusely at the thoughts that follow.</p><p>Agatha stands from her desk with a flirty smile. “And what has you blushing so sweetly?”</p><p>Rio blushes harder but she sends her a filthy smirk. “Ill tell you later.”</p><p>Agatha leans in for a chaste kiss when she gets close enough and Rio chases her lips when she pulls away. Agatha chuckles, “What brings you by?”</p><p>Rio clears her throat, suddenly feeling shy. “I just wanted to ask if you’re free this Saturday?”</p><p>Agatha grins and brings a hand up to tug on the bottom of Rio’s shirt. “Don’t get shy on me now, Vidal.” Rio blushes harder and closes her eyes with a smile. Agatha chuckles and places a kiss on the corner of her lips. “I am absolutely free. Are you asking me on that date?”</p><p>“Yes,” she clears her throat, “I am. I was hoping I could make you dinner, maybe we could watch a movie?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile softens. “I would love that.”</p><p>Rio’s face brightens, her shy demeanor gone. She leans in and steals a quick kiss before backing away. “Okay. I’ll see you soon.” She blows her one last kiss before ducking out the door. She feels like she’s on cloud nine as she walks back to her classroom.</p><p>That is, until she turns the corner and sees none other than her ex girlfriend standing in front of her door.</p><p>She stops dead in her tracks, her blood turns to ice in her veins.</p><p>Stacy spots her before she has the chance to turn and run, sending her a big smile and it makes her feel sick.</p><p>She takes a hesitant step forward as Stacy takes three.</p><p>“Stacy..” she croaks.</p><p>“Rio! Oh, I’m so glad I found you,” Stacy says happily.</p><p>“What the <em>fuck</em> are you doing here?” Rio snaps before looking around and lowering her voice. “I have nothing to say to you.”</p><p>Stacy sighs. “Please don’t be like that, I was so excited to see you.”</p><p>“Well I don’t know why!”</p><p>“I miss you, is all,” she says with a shy expression and it makes Rio’s blood boil. “I’ve been trying to get ahold of you.”</p><p>“I don’t care. I said I have nothing to say to you. Leave me the fuck alone,” she hisses and turns to enter her room.</p><p>“They're hiring for a french teacher!” Stacy yells and Rio freezes. “And I’m applying…”</p><p>Rio feels like she’s going to throw up. She slowly turns around. “What?” she growls.</p><p>“They’re hiring a fren-”</p><p>“<em>I heard you</em>,” Rio snaps. “But <em>why</em> did you just say that?” she strains.</p><p>Stacy walks into Rio’s room like it’s no big deal. She turns and says, “Because, I just want to be closer to you, is that so bad? I want to show you how sorry I am for how things ended.”</p><p>“Yes, it’s bad! I don’t want you here! I moved to get away from you! How did you even find me?!”</p><p>“We had good times, didn’t we? We can get back to that, I know we can!” she says desperately.</p><p>“Ugh!” Rio yells, so angry she’s at a loss for words.</p><p>“Is everything alright?” she hears Agatha ask from the doorway and her voice is like a cool balm on her heated skin.</p><hr/><p>“Ms. Harkness! Something’s wrong, Ms. Vidal is fighting with some lady. She seems really upset,” Hannah says frantically as she rushes into Agatha’s room.</p><p>Agatha is up and rushing down the hall in a split second. She doesn’t even have time to wonder why Hannah would come to get <em>her</em> of all people, although she’s glad she did.</p><p>“Is everything alright?” Agatha asks from the doorway of Rio’s room, Rio looking angrier than she’s ever seen her, glaring at some woman.</p><p>The woman looks to Agatha and frowns. “Everything’s fine, thank you.”</p><p>“Get out,” Rio growls, her fists clenched at her sides.</p><p>Agatha looks between them warily, never having heard Rio use that tone before.</p><p>“Rio, please,” the woman pleads.</p><p>“Stacy. <em>Get. Out</em>.” Rio growls.</p><p>Stacy sighs dejectedly. “Alright, but I’m not going anywhere. My interview is on Monday.”</p><p>Rio closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. She misses the cold glare that Agatha throws at Stacy as she walks past her, and the way Stacy flinches.</p><p>Agatha slowly walks up to her and places her hand on her back, rubbing soothing circles. “What’s going on?” she asks calmly.</p><p>Rio slumps down into her desk chair and rests her head in her hands, her elbows leaning on her desk. She takes deep breaths to calm herself.</p><p>“Rio… Who was that?” Agatha asks hesitantly.</p><p>Rio sits up with a sigh and hugs her arms around herself. “My ex girlfriend… It… ended badly.”</p><p>“Oh…” Agatha pauses. “What did she mean, her interview is Monday?” she asks, dreading the answer.</p><p>Rio looks up at her with a miserable expression. “She’s interviewing for the French position.”</p><p>She immediately wants to help, needing to wipe that depressed look off of Rio’s face, it hurts her to see her so miserable. “No. No way.” Agatha shakes her head, “I won’t let her, darling, don’t you worry,” she says as she bends down to kiss her forehead.</p><p>“There’s nothing to do, Agatha, just hope she bombs her interview, I guess,” she says miserably.</p><p>Agatha cups her chin and tilts her face up towards her. “What’s her name?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“What. is. her. name?” she says slowly with raised eyebrows.</p><p>“Um… Stacy Monroe. Why?”</p><p>Agatha bends down and places a slow kiss on her lips. She pulls back and whispers, “Don’t worry about it, darling. Are you going to be alright? Class starts in five minutes.”</p><p>Rio’s sighs heavily. “Yeah, I’m okay.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll see you after school, okay?”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>Agatha places one last kiss on her lips before leaving. She doesn’t go back to her room. It’s her free period, so she makes a beeline for Sharon’s office.</p><p>She waltzes past Carla and knocks twice on Sharon’s door before barging in.</p><p>“I’m cashing in my favor,” she states bluntly.</p><p>Sharon startles and looks at her with wide eyes. “W- what?”</p><p>“Last year, you asked for my help no questions asked and I did what you asked. You said you owed me and I’m cashing in.” Agatha takes a seat in the chair in front of Sharon’s desk and crosses her legs. “There’s a woman applying for the French teaching position and I need you not to hire her.”</p><p>“Um… May I ask… why?” Sharon asks hesitantly.</p><p>“Personal reasons. Her name is Stacy Monroe,” Agatha says, her hands clasped together in her lap.</p><p>“Oh! She was a wonderful candid- I mean- terrible, terrible candidate.” She clears her throat. “Alright. Um, let’s just… not tell anyone about this, yes?” Sharon says uncomfortably.</p><p>Agatha nods. “Thank you, Sharon,” she says as she gets up to leave.</p><p>“Agatha! Um, well, I’ll still have to do her interview, so you might still see her on Monday. Just so you know. For whatever your… personal reasons are, I mean.”</p><p>Agatha nods, already determined to keep that bitch away from Rio. She hated seeing how upset the interaction made her. She decides to invite her over tonight to try and cheer her up.</p>

<p>Rio knocks on Agatha’s door at 6:30, having immediately taken her up on the offer to come over tonight.</p><p>Agatha opens the door a second later with a warm smile. “Hey, you made it.”</p><p>Rio smiles shyly and steps inside when Agatha opens the door wider. “Thanks for inviting me,” she says timidly. She’s feeling like an anxious mess since seeing Stacy earlier.</p><p>“Of course, take out is in the kitchen, I thought we could put on a movie and just relax. Do you want some wine?”</p><p>Rio blows out a breath, “Yes, please,” she says instantly.</p><p>Agatha gently interlaces their fingers and pulls her towards the kitchen. She gives her a mini tour on the way.</p><p>“The living room is just through there, the bathroom is down the hall next to the closet, and the dining room is right here next to the kitchen."</p><p>The house feels warm and cozy, lit by lamps instead of harsh overhead lighting, which Rio appreciates.</p><p>“And this is the kitchen!” Agatha says as she turns towards Rio with her arms spread out. “Do you want to take the food to the couch?”</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” Rio says quietly.</p><p>Agatha rubs her arm before grabbing the bottle of wine and two glasses, Rio grabbing the bags of what smells like chinese food.</p><p>“I didn’t know what you liked, so I just got some of everything. Although you might have to fight me for the dumplings.” Agatha winks at her playfully and Rio smiles, already feeling the weight that’s been on her shoulders all day begin to lift.</p><p>Agatha fills up their glasses as Rio begins to unpack the boxes of food, both of them moving in sync so naturally. The thought makes a warmth spread through Rio’s chest.</p><p>Agatha scrolls through movies until Rio makes a pleading sound in the back of her throat when she passes over an old Jimmy Stewart movie. She chuckles and puts it on. They eat their food in comfortable silence, just watching the movie, but when they’re both done Rio sets her glass down on the coffee table along with Agatha’s.</p><p>She leans over Agatha and nudges her to lay down on her back, curling her body against her side. The continue watching the movie as Agatha begins to play with her hair and rub random patterns on her back, Rio finally relaxing.</p><p>“Did you want to talk about it? Today, I mean. I know I was acting strangely,” Rio says quietly, her head tucked into Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Only if you want to. We can also just stay like this and relax, whatever you need,” Agatha says warmly.</p><p>Rio sighs and scoots back just a little so Agatha can look down at her. Rio looks down and begins to play with Agatha’s shirt, twisting it back and forth, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>“We were together for five years… She had just proposed to me and, I don’t know why, but I said yes. We weren’t good together, she was toxic and manipulative and mean, but for some reason, I thought getting married might solve our problems. What an idiot,” Rio sighs, disappointed in herself.</p><p>This is always hard to talk about, but she finds that she wants Agatha to know. She wants her to know everything about her.</p><p>“A few weeks later I came home early from a trip, wanting to surprise her, and I found her having sex with my best friend in our bed. Cliché, I know,” she lets out a self deprecating puff of a laugh. Agatha softly rakes her nails over her scalp reassuringly. “My best friend of twenty years, by the way. Apparently, they had been fucking for almost a year.. and she still fucking proposed. We would do all sorts of stuff together as a group, my friend had a partner as well.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrows, her heart rate spiking in renewed anger. Agatha uses her other hand to rub up and down her forearm and it helps calm her, she sighs. “It gets worse. I had to tell everyone the engagement was off, which was humiliating enough, but she went behind my back and convinced all our friends that <em>I</em> was the bad guy, that <em>I</em> had cheated on her. And they believed her.” Rio closes her eyes. “I was so tired of running into them everywhere, so I moved here.”</p><p>She pulls back and looks up at Agatha, trailing her eyes across her face. “And I’m really glad I did,” she whispers.</p><p>Agatha gives her a sad smile. “I’m so sorry you had to go through that, darling. You deserve so much better.” She places a kiss on her forehead and speaks against her skin, “You deserve the world.”</p><p>Rio leans into her, turning to bury her face in her neck when she feels tears pricking at her eyes. She inhales Agatha’s scent and it calms her immensely. Agatha’s still raking her nails across her scalp when she growls, “And I’ll kill the bitch if I see her again. She better stay the fuck away from you on Monday.”</p><p>Rio lets out a watery laugh against her neck, Agatha’s protective tone making her whole body tingle.</p><p>Rio sighs before pulling back to look at her again. “Do you mind if we postpone our date a bit? I’m a nervous wreck about her interview on Monday and I want to give you my full attention. I’m sorry,” she says sadly.</p><p>Agatha immediately cups her face, running her thumb along her cheek. “Don’t apologize, darling. Of course it’s alright. I don’t mind at all.”</p><p>Rio rests their foreheads together and whispers, “How did I get so lucky, huh?”</p><p>“Probably a saint in your past life,” Agatha quips.</p><p>Rio laughs, her bad mood forgotten for a moment as she leans forward to press her lips against Agatha’s. She kisses her for a minute before pulling back and brushing their noses together. She settles back down, laying her head on Agatha’s chest as they finish the movie.</p><p>After putting the food away Agatha looks over to Rio standing awkwardly by the stove. “Will you stay?” she asks shyly. “No funny business, I just.. want to hold you.”</p><p>Rio feels so happy she thinks she might burst into a million little pieces of confetti. She nods and Agatha interlaces their fingers once again before pulling her upstairs.</p><p>Agatha lovingly strips her down to her underwear and dresses her in one of her oversized shirts, placing a gentle kiss on her lips when she’s done before turning and changing herself. Rio is entirely unused to this type of care and affection, she doesn’t know what to do with the emotion creeping up her throat.</p><p>Agatha pulls the blankets back and pats the bed next to her, opening her arms. Rio crawls into them and tucks her head back under Agatha’s chin, resting her head on her chest as she tangles their legs together.</p><p>Rio falls asleep almost instantly, feeling more loved than she has in a long, long time.</p><hr/><p>Agatha runs her fingers through Rio’s hair, lightly scratching her scalp until she falls asleep in her arms.</p><p>She feels an overwhelming wave of emotion crash over her as she looks down at Rio’s sleeping form. How anyone could hurt her like that, she doesn’t know.</p><p>Rio is the sweetest person she’s ever met, to betray her so cruelly… <em>That bitch better fucking watch out on Monday</em>.</p><p>Agatha feels her blood pressure start to rise from her anger as she thinks of the pain Rio must have been in. She has to force herself to relax so she doesn’t wake her. She tells herself Rio is safe now, shell never have to go through anything like that again. Not if she has any say in it.</p><p>It’s that thought that sends her heart rate spiking in a completely different way… Rio will never have to go through that again because <em>she</em> will never mistreat Rio like that, and she doesn’t want Rio to ever be with anyone else but her.</p><p>It suddenly hits her just how deeply she cares for Rio… she doesn’t want to say the word, and yet it’s the only one that seems fitting for the depth of her affection for the woman in her arms.</p><p><em>She loves her</em>.</p><p>It’s true, she knows it is, and acknowledging it sends a rush of adrenaline through her veins. She’s terrified of being so vulnerable like this, but she knows she wouldn’t want it to be with anyone else but Rio.</p><p>She definitely won’t be <em>saying</em> any of this to her. Not yet, it’s way too soon. But she knows deep in her bones that she will one day. Probably sooner rather than later.</p><p>~</p><p>Agatha wakes up to her alarm blaring. She feels Rio stir in her arms, neither of them having separated the entire night.</p><p>Rio nuzzles her face into her neck and groans. “Mm, too earlyyy,” she whines.</p><p>Agatha chuckles and reaches back to turn her alarm off, which makes her pull their bodies apart, Rio chasing her as she goes. Agatha is absolutely loving needy Rio right now.</p><p>She smiles and wraps her arms around Rio’s neck, hugging her close. “We have school in an hour.”</p><p>“Uggghhhh,” Rio let’s out a long dramatic groan.</p><p>Agatha leans down to whisper in her ear, “Come on, if you get up now I might even let you shower with me. To save time, of course.”</p><p>Rio immediately perks up at that, her head shooting up and narrowly missing Agatha’s jaw. She’s up and out of bed in less than five seconds, standing at the side of the bed with a big smile.</p><p>“I’m up!”</p><p>Agatha laughs and covers her eyes as she rolls onto her back. Rio goes to the end of the bed and drags Agatha down by her ankles, Agatha letting out a shriek at the unexpected movement.</p><p>“Oh, you’re dead,” she says as she begins to sit up with a laugh.</p><p>“You’ll have to catch me,” Rio says seductively as she begins to peel off the oversized shirt Agatha had put on her. She starts backing towards the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha is a little hypnotized as she watches Rio slowly reveal her bare breasts before she’s scrambling off the bed after her. Rio disappears into the bathroom, giggling loudly.</p><p>She’s bent over the faucet turning on the shower when Agatha runs in. She slides up behind her and presses her hips flush with her panty covered ass. She runs a hand up her spine before bringing it back down, tugging her underwear down slowly until they drop to the floor. Rio grins at her over her shoulder before turning around.</p><p>“Your turn,” she says as she begins to lift Agatha’s shirt.</p><p>Agatha rips it off and surges forward to kiss her, clumsily removing her underwear as well. She checks the temperature before pushing Rio under the spray, climbing in after her.</p><p>She pushes Rio against the tiles and presses their bodies flush together, the water making them slip and slide against each other. The sensation is unbelievable. Rio shivers from the duality of the cold tiles and Agatha’s scorching hot body.</p><p>Agatha kisses her again before sliding her thigh between Rio’s and pressing it upwards. Rio moans into her mouth and immediately begins to grind down. She whines when the water prevents her from getting any friction.</p><p>Agatha slowly trails her fingers down her stomach until she reaches her pussy. She spreads her folds with her first and ring finger, using her middle to lightly circle her clit.</p><p>“I th- thought you said we d-didn’t… have time…” Rio gasps.</p><p>“Mm, I can make time to tease you…” Agatha replies huskily.</p><p>Rio whines again and Agatha grins. “But I suppose we don’t want to be late for school…” She suddenly pushes two fingers into Rio, meeting no resistance because of how soaked she is. After a few pumps, she adds a third and Rio leans her head back against the tiles, her mouth hanging open.</p><p>She comes as soon as Agatha rubs her thumb over her clit, feeling their wet nipples rubbing together sends her over the edge. Agatha feels herself rather close to it as well.</p><p>Rio sags against the wall for a moment, Agatha pressing her body harder against her to hold her up. Their breasts smash together.</p><p>Rio opens her eyes and grins at her mischievously. She suddenly flips them around and drops to her knees in front of Agatha with a devilish smirk on her face.</p><p>Suffice to say, they’re almost late to school. They make it just in time, arriving in separate cars but with matching wet hair.</p><p>~</p><p>When Agatha checks in on her during break, Rio is a completely different person, back to being anxious and subdued. The stress of having Stacy near is clearly getting to her.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha says as she knocks on Rio’s door.</p><p>Rio startles and her head shoots up.</p><p>“Just me,” Agatha tries to put on a reassuring smile.</p><p>“Sorry, just a little jumpy. I’m worried she’s just going to show up again.” Rio’s shoulders slump.</p><p>Agatha walks over to her and wraps her arms around her from behind, resting her chin on her shoulder. Rio reaches up to hold her forearms as she leans her head back against her. Agatha turns her head and places a soft kiss against her exposed neck.</p><p>“It’s going to be alright, darling. I promise.”</p><p>Rio merely sighs. “Thank you for checking on me, I needed this.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Rio turns her head and Agatha places the softest kiss on her lips, trying to convey so much emotion through the simple action and hoping she understands.</p>

<p>“What do you <em>mean</em> you’ve never seen How the Grinch Stole Christmas?! It’s a classic!” Rio gapes at her, pausing their game.</p><p><em>“The Shop Around The Corner</em> is a classic.” Agatha smirks as she tries to throw another piece of popcorn into Rio’s mouth, missing and hitting her square in the forehead. She cackles at Rio’s affronted expression.</p><p>They’re sitting in Rio’s classroom having lunch together. Agatha wanted to distract her, it’s the day of Stacy’s interview and Rio is kind of one big ball of anxiety.</p><p>The warning bell rings and Agatha knows she has five minutes to get to her building, she looks at Rio with sad eyes. “That’s my cue. Goodbye, darling. Don’t worry too much, okay? It’ll be alright,” she says as she stands up and grabs her bag. She leans over and kisses Rio sweetly. “I’ll see you later.”</p><p>Rios expression fell as soon as the bell rang, her worry seemingly hitting her once again. <em>At least she forgot for a little while</em>.</p><p>She looks at Agatha with anxious eyes. “Yeah, I’ll… see you later.”</p><p>Agatha blows her a kiss when she opens the door to leave. As the door shuts behind her, she turns and comes face to face with Stacy, who is no doubt here looking for Rio in her room.</p><p>Agatha stops in her tracks and her warm smile turns into an icy glare in a split second when she realizes who’s in front of her, and where she was going.</p><p>“Can I help you?” Agatha says calmly, trying to reign in her anger. They <em>are</em> at school, after all. She doesn’t want to cause a scene.</p><p><em>She’s fucking lucky we’re surrounded by children.</em></p><p>“No, thank you,” Stacy says with a somewhat irritated expression at having Agatha block her path. She tries to step around her and Agatha steps in front of her again.</p><p>“You’re not going near her,” Agatha says with a look that could kill. “You need to leave.”</p><p>Stacy looks shocked for a moment before her expression morphs into indignation. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“You heard me. Leave.” Agatha growls.</p><p>“Who the hell are you to tell me-”</p><p>Agatha takes a step closer, getting in her personal space and lowering her voice dangerously. “If you know what’s good for you, you’ll turn around right now and walk out of here.”</p><p>Stacy’s mouth drops open and her eyes go wide. She huffs, “Ugh!” she shouts before turning around and stomping away. Agatha stands there to make sure she really leaves. Once she’s gone, students start trickling into Rio’s room and Agatha knows she needs to get to her next class.</p><hr/><p>Rio has been a nervous wreck all morning. Her lunch with Agatha had been a nice distraction, but as soon as she left the anxiety came rushing back. She knows what she has to do, but she’s dreading it. She just knows that there is absolutely no way she can work at the same school as <em>her</em>.</p><p>After the last bell rings, Rio takes a deep breath to calm her nerves before making her way to Sharon’s office. She knocks lightly and waits for Sharon to say come in, opening the door and peeking her head in.</p><p>“Hello, Rio! What brings you by?” Sharon says with a warm smile.</p><p>Rio tries to gather every ounce of courage she has as she takes a seat in front of her.</p><p>“This isn’t easy for me to say… and I know it’s unprofessional of me, but… there’s a woman who is applying for the French position here and… I just need to let you know that if you hire her, I’ll have to quit. Her name is Stacy Monroe and we have a.. complicated history,” she says, tense. She misses the way Sharon’s eyes widen at the name, too buys staring at her hands. “I really love it here and I don’t <em>want</em> to quit. <em>Please</em> don’t hire her, Sharon,” she pleads desperately. She feels herself start to get choked up as she nears the end of her speech. “I’m sorry to put you in this position, I don’t want it to sound like an ultimatum. I’m merely… asking,” she finishes lamely.</p><p>Sharon’s mouth hangs open for a moment before she slowly shuts it. “Well, you have nothing to worry about, dear. It appears we’re going with someone else after the interviews today.” She smiles at Rio kindly. “We wouldn’t want to lose you anyway, you’re one of our best teachers.”</p><p>Rio release a large breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding, sagging with relief. She closes her eyes and says, “Thank you, Sharon.”</p><p>She leaves after that and goes straight to Agatha’s classroom, knowing she usually stays after school to grade a bit.</p><p>She bursts through the door and Agatha startles, looking up at her worriedly. She stands up just as Rio surges forward and wraps her arms around her neck, hugging her close. She buries her face in Agatha’s neck and inhales, feeling her body finally relax.</p><p>Agatha immediately wraps her arms around Rio’s waist, rubbing her back. She has a concerned look on her face, although Rio can’t see it. “Darling? What’s wrong?”</p><p>Rio let’s out a relieved laugh and pulls back so they’re face to face. “Nothing. Nothing is wrong,” she shakes her head. “Everything is perfect.”</p><p>“Wha-?”</p><p>“I talked to Sharon, she said she’s going with someone else for the French position,” Rio says with a wide smile.</p><p>“That’s great!” Agatha smiles back.</p><p>Rio leans forward and connects their lips in a sweet kiss. She swipes her tongue over Agatha’s lips once before pulling back just an inch. “Let’s have our date this weekend.”</p><p>Agatha grins and pulls her closer. “I’d love to.”</p><hr/><p>Sharon didn’t think anything of it when Agatha came to her and told her not to hire that woman. She figured she had wronged Agatha somehow and this was Agatha getting back at her. She did owe her a favor, after all.</p><p>It wasn’t a difficult decision. Although she was a wonderful candidate, there were plenty of others that were equally, if not more qualified. But to have <em>Rio</em> come to her and tell her that <em>she</em> has a complicated history with the woman… it's quite interesting, indeed.</p><p>So Agatha cashed in her one favor with the principal on behalf of Rio. A favor that she could’ve used a hundred times over the past year but never did. Not even when it came to the funding of her trip.</p><p>To use it for Rio now… It was just incredibly sweet. She doesn’t know what’s going on between them, but she can guess from the way Agatha has been in a remarkably better mood as of late. Sharon smiles to herself.</p>

<p>Rio is checking that everything is set up perfectly for the fifth time. Candles, check. Music, check. Dinner, check. She looks in the mirror and frantically checks her makeup.</p><p>Agatha should be arriving any minute now, and Rio is beyond nervous. She wants this date to be perfect. They’ve sort of already had a couple dates, but this is the first official one and she wants it to go well.</p><p>She hears a knock on her door and she jumps, whipping around. She rushes to the door and does one last check of her outfit before opening it with a smile.</p><p>She swears her heart stops when she sees Agatha on her doorstep, dressed in a simple black dress with a low neckline that shows off her cleavage. She has her hair up in a clip with a few stray curls escaping. She looks too beautiful for this world.</p><p>Rio just stands there gaping like an idiot, her brain seems to have frozen completely as her eyes trail down Agatha’s body and Agatha smirks at her.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha says as she lets her eyes roam over Rio.</p><p>“…H-hi.” Rio stutters. “Uh.. come in, come in!”</p><p>She steps back from the door and Agatha slowly walks past her into her apartment. Rio closes it and turns to face her.</p><p>“I uh… I made lasagna,” she states weakly, trying to pull herself together.</p><p>“I love lasagna,” Agatha says with a warm smile.</p><p>“It’s got a uh.. secret ingredient,” she says shyly. “And wine! I’ve got red and white. Would you like some?”</p><p>Agatha nods and she moves towards the kitchen. “There’s not much to see, but this is the living room, my room is down the hall on the left, the bathroom is on the right, and the kitchen is over here,” she tells her.</p><p>Agatha follows behind her and when Rio glances at her standing in the kitchen doorway, she sees her smiling softly at her. She blushes instantly.</p><p>“Red please,” Agatha tells her.</p><p>Rio grabs two glasses and pours the wine. Agatha walks around the counter to meet her and grabs her glass. She takes a sip and watches Rio over the rim.</p><p>Rio takes a big sip of her own and Agatha chuckles. “Rio. Relax,” she tells her and leans in to kiss her slowly. “You’ve already got me,” she whispers.</p><p>Rio lets out a breath and chuckles. “I’m just nervous.”</p><p>“I can tell,” Agatha says with an amused smile.</p><p>Rio’s rolls her eyes at herself and clears her throat. “Dinner is ready if you want to eat?”</p><p>Agatha nods again with a smile. “I’m excited for this secret ingredient…” she says as she takes a seat at the table.</p><p>Rio takes the lasagna out of the oven along with the garlic bread and places them on the table. She serves them both before sitting across from Agatha and smiling shyly over the candles.</p><p>“You’ll have to guess.”</p><p>Agatha takes a bite of her food and her eyes go wide. “Holy shit,” she says as she covers her mouth with her hand. “Is it crack?”</p><p>Rio laughs and shakes her head. “Red pepper flakes.”</p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p>“I’m glad you like it,” Rio says, relieved.</p><p>“I think like is a little bit of an understatement.”</p><p>They continue eating as they talk about anything and everything, making eyes at each other the whole time.</p><p>“So, how long have you wanted to be a teacher?” Rio asks her.</p><p>“Always. I’ve known it’s what I wanted since I was little.” Agatha clears her throat, looking down at her plate. “My mother always wanted me to be something 'respectable’ like a doctor or a lawyer. She’s not exactly happy with my choices… we don’t talk much.”</p><p>“I’m sorry…” Rio says sincerely. “I’m not close with my family either. They don’t really approve of the whole… being gay thing.” It still stings to say, but she’s come to terms with it.</p><p>Agatha reaches across the table to put her hand over Rio’s and squeezes with a sympathetic look on her face. “And how long have you wanted to be a teacher?” she asks.</p><p>“Since high school. For the longest time I wanted to be an astronaut, but the food just wasn’t doing it for me.” Agatha laughs and Rio grins at her.</p><p>Shortly after, they move to the couch to put on a movie and relax. Agatha sits down with a groan, holding her stomach.</p><p>“I ate too much of your stupid amazing lasagna,” Agatha groans.</p><p>Rio laughs, sitting down next to her and grabbing the remote. She puts her arm over Agatha’s shoulders and Agatha smiles, immediately leaning into her. She scrolls until she sees How the Grinch Stole Christmas.</p><p>“Oh my god! I totally need to pop your grinch cherry right now.” Rio says seriously. This is a serious matter, after all. Agatha scrunches her nose up at her wording, but agrees to watch.</p><p>Halfway through, Agatha’s hand begins drawing random patterns on her thigh, inching higher and higher. Every little movement of her fingers makes Rio’s heart beat faster.</p><p>Agatha turns her head and rubs her nose against Rio’s neck. “Rio…” she sings.</p><p>“Hm?” Rio chokes out.</p><p>“How about we finish this another time, hm?” Agatha says huskily.</p><p>Rio looks down to find Agatha staring up at her with hooded eyes. “Yeah…” she says breathlessly before leaning down and connecting their lips.</p><p>Agatha immediately pushes herself forward, pressing her lips more firmly against hers. Rio licks her bottom lip and Agatha immediately opens for her, humming into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha hikes her dress up and swings a leg over Rio’s, straddling her lap. She tilts her head to deepen the kiss and licks further into her mouth. She brings both her hands up to tangle in Rio’s hair and tugs lightly, making Rio moan.</p><p>Rio fumbles for the zipper on the back of her dress, finally finding it and slowly tugging it down. As soon as Agatha feels her dress loosen, she slides her arms out and pushes it down. Rio’s face goes slack at her lack of a bra.</p><p>Rio suddenly surges forward to take a nipple in her mouth, bringing a hand up to give her other breast some attention, and Agatha throws her head back with a gasp.</p><p>Rio suddenly pulls back. “Wait, wait,” she says breathlessly. “I um… wanted to ask you…” She looks up into Agatha’s eyes, both of them breathing heavily from their heated make out session. Rio, suddenly feeling very shy, asks, “will you, um, be my… girlfriend? Like officially?” She cringes at how juvenile it sounds.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen, their make out session completely forgotten for a moment.</p><hr/><p>“Just wear the black dress. You’ll look hot,” Wanda says over the phone.</p><p>“But is it too slutty?” Agatha asks, sounding uncharacteristically anxious.</p><p>“No! It’s very classy. She won’t be able to take her eyes off you, trust me.”</p><p>“Ugh, alright.”</p><p>“Will you relax? It’s going to be fine. You’re already together!”</p><p>“Well… we haven’t exactly… talked about anything,” Agatha says hesitantly.</p><p>“Oh, please. That girl is so obsessed with you, it’s disgusting. You should see the way she looks at you when you aren’t looking. Like a cute little puppy,” Wanda laughs.</p><p>As much as she wants them to be together, they haven’t discussed making things official. She doesn’t know if Rio would even want to, and it’s currently sending her into a nervous spiral.</p><p>She goes with the black dress, and by the look on Rio’s face when she opens the door, she’d say it’s a hit.</p><p>She's sure her face shows her appreciation for Rio’s outfit just the same. She’s dressed in a white dress shirt and black pants, with the sleeves rolled up to her elbows. The sight of her forearms flexing as she moves makes Agatha’s mouth water.</p><p>She’s touched that Rio would want to cook for her, that it clearly means a lot to her, or else she wouldn’t be so anxious. Seeing how nervous she is makes Agatha’s nerves ease a bit.</p><p>This clearly means a lot to her too.</p><p>They sit down to eat the best lasagna she’s ever had in her life and talk about anything and everything. She tells her about her mother and it hurts to hear that Rio has a similar situation with her family. She wishes she could spare her the pain.</p><p>When they move to the couch, she can barely stand. Goddamn red pepper flakes. Rio puts on the grinch and Agatha tries to pay attention, she really does. It’s just that.. Rio is right next to her and she smells so good and she’s just so warm.</p><p>She can’t help herself, once her food has settled she turns her head to run her nose along Rio’s neck, inhaling her perfume. The fresh scent mixed with something uniquely Rio makes her a little dizzy.</p><p>“How about we finish this another time?” she asks.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replies, sounding just as affected by their proximity as she is.</p><p>Before she knows it, she’s in her lap, pushing her dress to her waist, smiling at the dumbfounded look on Rio’s face. She’s staring at her breasts like she’s never seen them before, her jaw slack and eyes hooded. Agatha chuckles.</p><p>When Rio pulls back, she panics for just a second, thinking Rio has changed her mind. Until she sees the shy look on her face and her heart rate spikes in anticipation instead. She always gets that look before she says something ridiculously sweet.</p><p>“Will you, um, be my… girlfriend? Like officially?”</p><p>She sees Rio cringe at her wording but she doesn’t care. She doesn’t care if they sound like teenagers, the word girlfriend coming out of Rio’s mouth makes her heart soar.</p><p>Her eyes go wide and her jaw drops a little before she’s smiling so wide she thinks her face might break in half. A giddy laugh bubbles up in her throat as she surges forward to kiss her desperately.</p><p>Rio’s hands raise from where they settled on her hips to clutch at her bare back. Agatha pulls back just barely to whisper against her lips. “Yes, Rio. I would love to.”</p><p>Rio sends her the brightest smile and she feels something click into place in her chest. Nothing has ever felt so right before.</p><p>They break for air and Agatha wastes no time in moving down to Rio’s neck. She begins unbuttoning her dress shirt as she sucks the sensitive skin underneath her ear. Rio throws her head back and moans loudly.</p><p>Agatha feels Rio’s hands gripping her bare ass. The thong she’s wearing doesn’t cover much, and is doing absolutely nothing to stop the wet spot from forming on Rio’s pants where shes been grinding, looking for friction.</p><p>“Please, my darling.. Touch me,” Agatha whines into her ear and Rio moans.</p><p>“Alright, baby. You’re gonna ride my fingers.”</p><p>Agatha moans loudly at both the pet name and Rio ordering her around. She spreads her legs as far as she can, opening up for her.</p><p>Rio reaches down and slides her thong to the side before spreading her wetness around her folds. Her pussy is sopping wet, Rio really doesn’t need to wait, but apparently she feels like teasing.</p><p>She lightly brushes over her clit and Agatha whines. She thrusts her hips forward, trying to find her fingers and Rio chuckles.</p><p>“Okay, okay.”</p><p>Rio finally slips the tips of two fingers into her, but it’s not enough. Agatha whines and tries to push herself down, but Rio just pulls away.</p><p>“Ah ah ah. You need to be good for me baby.”</p><p>Agatha huffs and pouts at her. Rio merely leans forward for a quick kiss. She puts just the tips of her fingers back inside her and Agatha sighs at finally getting something, even if it isn’t enough.</p><p>Rio kisses down her neck, across her chest, making her way to her nipples as she lightly traces her tongue around her areola. She very slowly pushes her fingers inside, making sure Agatha feels every inch.</p><p>Agatha moans loudly as she’s slowly filled. She swears she can feel every ridge on Rio’s long fingers. Once she’s fully seated on them, Rio stays still. Agatha tries to move her hips but Rio’s grip on her tightens, stopping her movements. She whines, tucking her head into Rio’s neck and wrapping her arms around her.</p><p>“Please,” she whispers.</p><p>“Please what, baby?” Rio asks coyly. Agatha could really smack her right now.</p><p>“Please… fuck me..” she begs.</p><p>“As you wish.”</p><p>Rio slowly drags her fingers out until the very tips are inside her and then slams them back in, immediately fucking her at a fast pace.</p><p>She moves her thumb to lightly swipe back and forth over her clit and Agatha sees stars. Her forehead is pressed against Rio’s shoulder and her mouth is gaping open as she grips the back of the couch. Rio reaches up to pinch her nipples and it sends an electric current shooting through her body.</p><p>“Oh god!” she moans, her face scrunched up in pleasure.</p><p>Rio tucks her head and sucks the sensitive skin of her neck until a hickey starts to form. Agatha throws her head back. Rio reaches up and releases the clip keeping her hair up, letting it fall in waves down her back.</p><p>She feels Rio thread her fingers into her hair and tug her head backwards, the feeling making her shout in pleasure.</p><p>Rio rapidly circles her clit, curls her fingers and massages her g spot, and she’s gushing all over her lap, probably staining her poor couch. Her body jerks on top of Rio’s until she slumps over, exhausted.</p><p>Rio draws light patterns on her bare back, humming. She can feel her smiling into her shoulder. She weakly reaches her hand up and smacks her arm.</p><p>“You make me come too hard,” she jokes. Rio laughs loudly and wiggles the fingers still inside of her.</p><p>“Ah!” Agatha exclaims weakly before laughing. She wraps her arms around Rio’s neck and pulls her in for a soft kiss.</p><p>“So you’re complaining that your girlfriend makes you come too hard? See how much sympathy that gets you,” Rio smiles.</p><p>Agatha grins and rubs their noses together. “Girlfriend…” She leans forward and kisses her sweetly, both of them smiling into the kiss like lovesick fools.</p><p>They make their way up to the room not long after, Agatha stumbling on wobbly legs, and she enacts her revenge. She makes Rio beg her to let her come on her tongue, having edged her at least four times.</p><p>They fall asleep tangled together once again, Agatha resting her head on Rio’s chest, her leg thrown over her hips as Rio lays on her back. Neither of them move the whole night.</p><p>Rio goes to Agatha’s the following night, packing a bag so they can carpool to school the next day.</p><p><em>“We could carpool tomorrow, if you want,” Agatha suggests casually.</em></p><p><em>“Then my car will be at your house, though,” Rio says, confused.</em></p><p><em>Agatha smiles into the phone. “I suppose you’ll just have to come back with me then.”</em></p><p><em>A mischievous grin slowly creeps up Rio’s face. “Oh? And will I be driving home afterwards?”</em></p><p><em>“Definitely not,” Agatha says smoothly.</em></p><p>That had settled it, Rio packed a bag as fast as she could and they drove to school together the next morning.</p><p>When Wanda sees them walk into school together, hand in hand, she grins at them. “Good morning, lovebirds. One car today?” she asks teasingly.</p><p>Agatha smacks her arm with her free hand and laughs. “Shut up.”</p>

<p>Rio’s sitting on her couch, working on her laptop when it’s suddenly snatched out of her hands. The next second, Agatha is straddling her lap with a dirty grin.</p><p>“You’ve worked long enough, darling. Come to bed,” she pouts, reaching up to play with Rio’s collar.</p><p>They’ve been dating for a month now and things couldn’t be better. Rio is the happiest she’s ever been in her life.</p><p>She laughs lightheartedly. “Babe, I need to grade these essays… and it’s only 7:30!”</p><p>“Mm, I’m sure we can think of something to occupy ourselves until we get tired…” she says seductively.</p><p>Pudge chooses that moment to crawl in between them with a loud meow, clearly hungry.</p><p>“Pudge objects,” Rio says, amused.</p><p>Agatha immediately softens and pets him adoringly. “Are you hungry, my baby? Let’s get you some food.” She picks him up and climbs off of Rio’s lap, moving towards the kitchen to open a can of wet food. Pudge lets out a happy meow and starts purring as soon as Agatha gives him her attention.</p><p>They’re at Rio’s apartment, where Agatha now has a drawer and a designated area in the bathroom for all her toiletries and makeup. Where she also seems to be her cats new favorite person, although Rio isn’t truly bothered by it. She finds it absolutely adorable. She loves the way Agatha gets all soft around him.</p><p>“He likes you more than me, I swear,” Rio pouts playfully, picking her laptop back up.</p><p>Agatha smiles and makes him sit like a dog before putting his bowl down, pudge letting out a happy cry.</p><p>“I still can't believe you trained my cat to sit,” Rio laughs. “He doesn’t listen to me at all.”</p><p>Agatha grins as she moves to sit next to Rio this time. “I guess I really am his favorite,” she teases.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes and tries to go back to grading, but Agatha leans in and begins running her nose up her neck. She completely loses focus.</p><p>“Agathaaa,” she whines.</p><p>“Hm? Oh, don’t mind me,” Agatha replies innocently and Rio huffs. She closes her laptop and tosses it to the side, grabbing Agatha and hauling her onto her lap. Agatha yelps and giggles at the action, moving to straddle her once again.</p><p>“We should take a trip,” Agatha says, playing with her hair.</p><p>“A trip?” Rio asks, tilting her head like a confused puppy.</p><p>“Yeah. Spring break is coming up, we should go away somewhere.”</p><p>Rio smiles wide. “I’d love to,” she says softly. “What did you have in mind?”</p><p>“Mm. I don’t know.. Somewhere comfortable where I can fuck you all. week. long.” she whispers, slowly leaning in until their lips are only an inch apart. She doesn’t connect them yet, teasing her.</p><p>Rio leans forward to kiss her and Agatha pulls back, waiting for the pout that she adores to bloom on Rio’s face before she cups her cheek and surges forward.</p><hr/><p>They decide on a cabin and Agatha finds them a nice one, secluded in the woods where they won’t be interrupted. It has a hot tub in the back as well, which she’s definitely looking forward to.</p><p>The drive is a couple hours and when the cabin comes into view, Rio has a look of wonder on her face.</p><p>“Holy shit! This place looks so nice!” she exclaims joyfully.</p><p>Agatha smiles at her, glad that she made the right choice. “Wait until you see inside.”</p><p>Rio parks the car and grabs their bags, following Agatha inside. She sets them by the door and looks around in awe. It really is a beautiful cabin, Agatha knew it was the one as soon as she saw it online.</p><p>Agatha walks further into the living room, standing in front of a large fur rug in front of the fireplace. Rio sneaks up behind her and places her hands on Agatha's hips, pressing her body flush against her back.</p><p>“Mm. I’ll be fucking you in front of that later,” Rio says as she leans in to nibble on her earlobe.</p><p>Agatha leans back into her and hums. She spins around until their fronts are pressed together and wraps her arms around Rio’s neck. “You’re gonna love the bedroom,” she says with a cheeky grin.</p><p>Rio grabs their bags and Agatha leads her across the cabin to the master bedroom. Rio’s jaw drops. It’s <em>huge</em>. A king size bed sits in the middle of the room, natural light filling the space beautifully. Two large glass doors lead out to the balcony with a beautiful view of the woods.</p><p>Agatha sits on the bed and crosses her legs, spreading her arms out behind her and sending Rio her most seductive look. “There’s a hot tub out back you’ll be fucking me in as well.”</p><p>Rio drops the bags where she’s standing and lunges at her. Agatha yelps as she jumps on top of her, giggling as Rio pins her arms above her head.</p><p>Later that night, Rio begs her to go in the hot tub.</p><p>“Already?” Agatha chuckles.</p><p>Rio just gives her a dirty smile and nods. “Mhm. Come on.”</p><p><em>As if she’d ever say no to that</em>.</p><p>They both run upstairs to change, Agatha in a red bikini and Rio in a black one. Agatha goes in the bathroom to change, wanting to have a big reveal of the new suit she bought just for this. And what a reveal it is…</p><p>She opens the door and leans against the doorway, posing for Rio, who looks up and freezes like a deer in headlights. Her bathing suit is, admittedly, very skimpy. It doesn’t exactly leave much to the imagination. There’s little red strings tying the sides together along with ties behind her back and neck. Little red triangles are the only thing holding her breasts up.</p><p>Rio’s bathing suit is a little more practical, but the sight of her bare abs and legs has Agatha hypnotized as well.</p><p>“On second thought, let’s just stay right here,” Rio says weakly as she stares at Agatha’s cleavage. She starts walking towards her slowly, reaching for the ties on Agatha’s hips when Agatha puts her hand on her chest, stopping her.</p><p>“Down boy. There’s a hot tub with our name on it, we’re going,” Agatha laughs.</p><p>Rio pouts for a moment before Agatha turns to lead her out the door and she gets a clear view of the way her bottoms ride up her ass. Agatha looks over her shoulder and sees her practically drooling.</p><p>Once they get outside, Agatha pushes Rio towards the water and climbs in after her, immediately straddling her lap. She throws her arms over her shoulders and just looks at her.</p><p>Never in her life has anyone meant this much to her, and it’s still so soon in their relationship. The thought makes her nervous, but not nearly as much as she thought it would. She never thought she could be so vulnerable with someone, she swore she would never let anyone past her walls, and yet Rio blew right through them so easily.</p><p>Agatha sighs happily and rests her forehead against Rio’s, trying desperately to hold back the three words threatening to burst out of her at any moment. She doesn’t want to be the first one to say them.</p><p>Except, she doesn’t trust herself to be able to hold them in any longer. She tilts her head and kisses her instead, slipping her tongue in between Rio’s lips. She feels Rio’s tongue gently massage her own and she moans.</p><p>The mood shifts into something more serious, both of them trying to convey an emotion too deep to name. Rio reaches down and unties her bottoms, letting them float away, and Agatha pulls her in to kiss her harder.</p><p>She rides Rio’s fingers like her life depends on it, breathing hard into Rio’s open mouth and staring into her eyes as she comes. She immediately tucks her head into Rio’s shoulder, feeling overwhelmed. She feels tears start to prick at her eyes and she blinks them away.</p><p><em>I love you</em>, she thinks as hard as she can, hoping Rio can feel it.</p>

<p>They spend the entire first half of their vacation fucking each other senseless in the ridiculously large bed, only leaving the bedroom to christen the other rooms in the house. So far, they’ve had sex in every room except the laundry room, but Agatha's sure they’ll get to that at some point.</p><p>She’s reading her book on the couch while Rio goes to the store about twenty minutes away. Rio had said something about a surprise and absolutely forbid Agatha from going with her, so now she’s sitting alone in the living room, missing her.</p><p>She hears the front door open and a rush of excitement floods her chest. She looks over the back of the couch and sees Rio peek just her head in.</p><p>“Close your eyes!” Rio shouts.</p><p>“What?” Agatha laughs.</p><p>“Close themmm,” she whines. “No peeking!”</p><p>Agatha raises a hand over her eyes with a smile. She hears quick rustling as Rio makes her way into the kitchen.</p><p>“Okay! You can open them!” she yells from the kitchen. She puts the groceries away and comes into the living room. She falls on the couch with a smile. “No going in the fridge, though.”</p><p>“What's this big surprise, huh?” Agatha smiles at her, putting her book down.</p><p>“I’m making you dinner. The surprise comes after.”</p><p>Agatha nudges her with her bare foot. “Tell me…” she pouts.</p><p>Rio grabs her foot and begins to massage it. “Nuh uh. It’s a surpriiiise.”</p><p>She lightly runs her finger up the bottom of her foot and Agatha yelps. Her body jerks involuntarily and she tries to squirm away, but Rio traps her foot on her lap and begins tickling her.</p><p>She continues for a few minutes before she stops and lets Agatha catch her breath. She crawls up her body and lowers herself so her weight is resting on her. She smiles as Agatha glares up at her.</p><p>“Mean.” Agatha pouts.</p><p>Rio steals a quick kiss and her pout softens. She leans in again for a slower kiss and Agatha melts against her, unable to stay mad for long.</p><p>~</p><p>Rio makes her signature lasagna for dinner and Agatha eats too much once again. They relax on the couch in front of the fire to let their food settle, Agatha laying on Rio’s chest as Rio reads to her.</p><p>After a while, she looks up at Rio and just watches her, trailing her eyes over the features she loves so much.</p><p><em>She’s so beautiful…</em></p><p>Rio pauses her reading when she feels Agatha’s gaze on her. She looks down and smiles.</p><p>“Are you ready for your surprise?” she asks quietly.</p><p>Agatha grins, having completely forgotten. She nods excitedly.</p><p>“Okay, go sit by the fire, I’ll be back in a minute,” she says as she motions for her to get up.</p><p>Agatha moves to kneel on the fur rug in front of the fireplace. She places another log in the fire and watches it burn.</p><p>“Okay, close your eyes again!”</p><p>She closes them and hears Rio come closer. She hears more rustling and the clinking of glasses before Rio tells her it’s okay to open her eyes. When she does, the first thing she sees is Rio with a big smile on her face and her arms out wide.</p><p>“Surprise! I got champagne and strawberries and chocolate syrup and whip cream,” Rio says excitedly.</p><p>Agatha smiles softly before her smile turns filthy. She crawls forward until she’s in Rio’s personal space. “Mm, I can’t wait to lick it off of you. Thank you, baby.”</p><p>She leans in for a slow kiss, both of them getting lost in it for a moment before Agatha pulls back and crawls into Rio’s lap. She reaches beside them and pours their champagne.</p><p>She grabs the bowl of chocolate syrup and dips her finger in, then brings it up to swipe across Rio’s bottom lip, leaning in to suck it off. She pulls back with Rio’s lip between her teeth so Rio has to move with her, sucking it like a lollipop.</p><p>She lets go with a pop and smiles seductively. Rio stares at her with hooded eyes before surging forward for a desperate kiss. Agatha pulls back with a laugh.</p><p>“Let’s have some champagne and strawberries before you ravish me, darling,” she laughs, wiping some chocolate off the corner of Rio’s lips and sucking it off her thumb. She sips her champagne with a smile as she watches the dazed look on Rio’s face out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>They make it through their second glass before she can’t take it any longer.</p><p>She’s straddling Rio’s lap, playing with her hair as Rio places soft kisses all over her neck, just holding each other close, when the mood shifts.</p><p>She threads her hands into the hair at the nape of Rio’s neck and tugs her head back, immediately covering her lips with her own.</p><p>They quickly strip off their clothes until they’re both lying naked in front of the fire, which feels amazing on her bare skin. Agatha pushes her down so she's lying flat on her back and she hovers over her with a devilish smirk.</p><p>Agatha grabs the chocolate syrup and pours some into the hollow of Rio’s throat. She grabs the whip cream and sprays some directly on her nipples, the cold sensation making Rio squirm.</p><p>Agatha sits back on Rio’s hips and surveys her work with a proud smile. Rio lets out a breathless chuckle in anticipation.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t waste another second. She leans down and sucks the syrup off of her throat, making sure to suck hard enough to leave a mark. She slowly trails her tongue down the center of her chest. When she gets to Rio’s nipples she pauses and teasingly flicks her left one with her tongue.</p><p>She savors the taste of the whip cream before taking a broad lick of her nipple, taking most of the cream off. She smiles as she takes it into her mouth to suck, Rio throwing her head back with a gasp. Felling greedy, Agatha takes as much of her breast into her mouth as she can, switching between sucking and flicking her tongue rapidly like she would over her clit.</p><p>She does the same to the other nipple, taking her time before grabbing the whip cream again. She sprays more over Rio’s curls, leaning down to inhale her scent combined with the sweet cream.</p><p>Rio spreads her legs wide as Agatha settles on her stomach between her thighs. Agatha grips one and pulls it over her shoulder while pushing the other outwards.</p><p>She licks around her clit lightly, not making direct contact until she hears the adorable little whine that Rio does when Agatha teases her. Right on cue, Rio whines for her and she smiles.</p><p>She takes her clit between her lips and sucks on it, feeling Rio’s thighs snap shut over her ears. Agatha moans into her, she can never get enough of how she tastes, especially with the syrup and cream still on her tongue.</p><p>She moves lower and licks into her, shoving her tongue as far in as it’ll go before pulling out and replacing it with two of her fingers. She moves her mouth to back to her clit and continues sucking, curling her fingers and massaging that spot inside her that drives her crazy.</p><p>Rio’s moans immediately go up a decimal, turning into high pitched shrieks as she sucks harder on her clit. She reaches up to lightly pinch her nipple and she feels Rio gush into her mouth.</p><p>She takes her fingers out and lowers her mouth to catch everything, not wanting to waste a single drop.</p><p>Rio goes limp and Agatha stays for a minute to clean her up, peppering kitten licks all over her cunt, getting as much of her come as she can.</p><p>She climbs up Rio’s body, expecting her to need a minute to recover, but she immediately pulls her close and flips them over so Agatha is on her back.</p><p>Rio kisses her hard, sucking her tongue into her mouth and moaning as she tastes herself. She immediately straddles Agatha’s thighs with a dirty grin.</p><p>“My turn.”</p><p>She grabs the whip cream and sprays a line from her neck all the way down to her pussy, leaving a little heart on her curls and her belly button. She sprays little smiley faces on her nipples and Agatha laughs loudly. Rio grins at her and leans down for a kiss.</p><p>She kisses down her neck, sucking hard enough to leave hickeys that Agatha knows she’ll have to cover up, until she gets to the top of the line she made.</p><p>She slowly licks from the center of her chest up to the hollow of her throat. Agatha closes her eyes with a sigh, loving the feeling of Rio’s tongue on her skin.</p><p>Rio moves lower, kissing over her breasts and pausing to suck on her nipples until they harden in her mouth. She continues on down her body, placing slow kisses over where her stomach extends a bit from eating too much lasagna earlier.</p><p>She slowly dips her tongue into Agatha’s belly button and it sends a chill up her spine. She sucks all the whip cream off her torso before moving down to her pussy.</p><p>Rio settles in between her legs and pushes them up as far as they’ll go, watching as Agatha’s folds spread for her.</p><p>She leans forward and sucks the whip cream off the top of her cunt, licking into her curls. She lets her tongue slither down in between her folds until she reaches her core, making her tongue firm and slowly pushing inside her.</p><p>Agatha moans loudly and arches her back, gripping behind her knees to keep herself open. When Rio moves up to suck on her clit, she whimpers and chokes out, “Rio.. get t-the… strap…” in between gasps.</p><p>Rio is up and out of the room in an instant, definitely not needing to be asked twice.</p><p>She comes rushing back into the room a moment later, clumsily stepping into the strap. Agatha stretches out on the rug with her arms above her head, sending Rio her best bedroom eyes.</p><p>“Fuck, baby. You look so hot like this,” Rio says breathlessly as she gets the strap situated and kneels between her legs. She grips her thighs and pushes them open, bending down for one more lick of her sopping wet cunt.</p><p>Agatha moans and pulls her up so she’s leaning over her. She wraps her legs around her hips and pulls her against her. “Don’t tease, darling. Fuck me.. <em>please</em>,” Agatha begs.</p><p>Rio doesn’t feel like teasing, not when Agatha is squirming like this, so clearly desperate for her cock. She lines herself up and pushes the tip in, meeting barely any resistance. She pushes more in slowly.</p><p>Agatha moans loudly and claws at her back. “Oh, fuck!” she shouts.</p><p>“I love how tight you are, baby. Always squeezing my fingers. You feel so good around my cock,” Rio rasps in her ear.</p><p>Agatha continues to moan and shout as she rakes her nails down Rio’s back. She reaches down and grips her ass with one hand, pulling her closer.</p><p>“Fuck, harder baby. Please,” Agatha begs.</p><p>“As you wish,” Rio grins.</p><p>She pulls back until just the tip is inside her before slamming her hips forward, bottoming out. Agatha shrieks in pleasure and digs her nails in. Rio grunts from the pain but keeps going.</p><p>She reaches down to rub circles around her clit, never stopping her thrusts, and Agatha screams.</p><p>“Oh god! I’m close!” Agatha pants.</p><p>Rio chooses that moment to pull out completely and Agatha makes a choked sound in protest. She looks up at her, confused for a moment, before Rio flips her over and pulls her up on her knees.</p><p>Agatha moans deeply and arches her back, stretching her arms out and spreading her legs wide. Rio wastes no time and slides right back into her, thrusting at the fast pace they had a moment ago.</p><p>Rio reaches her hand up and slaps her ass, watching the flesh move and a pink handprint begin to form. The slap lights all of Agatha’s nerves on fire, she whines loudly and begins pushing her hips back to meet Rio’s thrusts.</p><p>“Again!” she yells.</p><p>Rio obeys and slaps her again, this time the other cheek. She does it again and again, Agatha letting out sharp cries at each one.</p><p>Rio reaches around to frantically rub her clit, knowing she’s close, and Agatha slaps a hand down on the rug with a loud, “FUCK!”</p><p>The angle Rio is thrusting into her is rapidly hitting that spot inside her that makes her come like a fountain, and that’s exactly what she does.</p><p>She grips the rug as if it’s the only thing tethering her to the earth as Rio desperately fucks into her. Her face scrunches up in pleasure and her body begins to shake. Rio suddenly grips her hair and pulls her head back. The pleasure is so intense, she goes completely silent, unable to make a sound as her mouth hangs open.</p><p>A second later, Rio’s thighs are soaked and the rug they’re on is definitely ruined. Rio is running her hand up and down her back soothingly as her hips begin to slow.</p><p>She gently pulls out of her and Agatha falls face first into the rug, taking big gasps of air. Her entire body feels boneless, she couldn’t move if she tried.</p><p>Rio takes the strap off and moves to Agatha’s side, pulling her up so she’s spooning her. Agatha just lets herself be moved, enjoying the feeling of Rio’s front pressed against her back. She hums weakly.</p><p>Rio nuzzles into the back of her neck and smiles. “This is the happiest I’ve ever been in my life,” she whispers.</p><p>Agatha smiles and slowly twists onto her back and then her side, facing Rio. She smiles at her and whispers, “Me too.”</p><p>Rio brings her clean hand up to trace along Agatha’s brow bone, down her cheek, across her lips. She’s staring at her so adoringly that, without even thinking, Agatha suddenly says, “I love you.”</p><p>Her eyes widen at the same time as Rio’s, neither of them having expected that to come out of her mouth just then.</p><p>“You… love me?” Rio asks, her voice full of wonder.</p><p>“I- um, yes. I- I do." Agatha clears her throat, incredibly nervous all of a sudden.</p><p>Rio surges forward and kisses her hard. She pulls back to whisper against her lips, “I love you too, Agatha. So much.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen again and she feels them begin to water, tears threatening to spill. She laughs happily and Rio joins in. Agatha leans forward to connect their lips once more but it’s barely even a kiss with how wide they’re smiling.</p><p>Rio peppers quick kisses all over Agatha’s face, her cheek, her nose, her forehead, back down to her lips, Agatha giggling the whole time. She places her forehead against Agatha’s and sighs softly.</p><p>“I love you,” she says.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t wipe the smile off her face if she tried. “I love you too, darling. More than anything.”</p>

<p>“Hey baby,” Rio says when she comes home to find Agatha already on her couch, watching a movie with Pudge on her lap.</p><p>They exchanged keys a couple months ago and now Agatha is at her apartment more often than not. Rio is absolutely ecstatic about it.</p><p>“Hello, my love. How was your day?” Agatha says, tilting her head back.</p><p>Rio leans over to give her a kiss before coming around the couch and flopping down next to her with a huff. “Exhausting. These kids are killing me with finals coming up.”</p><p>“Well I might have some news that will cheer you up,” Agatha says with a smile.</p><p>“Oh? Is it whatever you’re wearing underneath this outfit?” Rio says, creeping closer. Agatha chuckles.</p><p>“No, I’m afraid not. Guess who’s group you’ll be chaperoning for the senior trip?”</p><p>“Really?! Sharon paired us together? That’s great! Oh, it’s gonna be so much fun!” Rio says excitedly.</p><p>“I may have pulled some strings,” Agatha grins.</p><p>Rio leans in for a kiss and hums against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“So what’s your favorite ride?” she asks after they’ve settled down together on the couch.</p><p>“I’ve never been on one.” Agatha replies.</p><p>“What?!” Rio shouts as she shoots up. “Oh, I am <em>so</em> getting you on a roller coaster.”</p><p>“No, you most certainly are not.” Agatha laughs at the idea.</p><p>Rio gapes at her. “What do you mean no?! This is your trip!”</p><p>“Yes, because the kids love it. I’m just there to make sure they don’t get into any trouble.”</p><p>After a minute of her mouth hanging open, she snaps it shut. “I’m totally getting you on one,” Rio says with a grin.</p><hr/><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Oh, come onnn. Please? Pretty please?”</p><p>“No. No way,” Agatha shakes her head.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>“Rio, I love you, but no.”</p><p>“Awww!” two of Agatha’s students say from behind them, popping their heads over their bus seat. Agatha turns and gives them a playful glare. They just grin at her and sit back down.</p><p>Rio pleads with her the whole ride, even stooping as low as trying to bribe her, but she still stands firm.</p><p>Once they're inside, the kids are let loose. As long as they stay inside the gates and don’t cause any trouble, they’re free to do whatever they please.</p><p>That suits her just fine because it means her and Rio get the day to themselves. Although Rio is determined to kill her on a metal death trap at some point today, she’s looking forward to the time spent together.</p><p>As soon as the kids are gone, Rio grabs her hand and leads her towards a big candy store.</p><p>“It’s 9am!” Agatha laughs.</p><p>“Hey, gotta stock up for the day,” Rio tells her very seriously. Agatha just rolls her eyes.</p><p>Rio fills up a whole bag with all sorts of candy and they begin exploring the park. They spend the first couple hours wasting all their money on the rigged carnival games until Rio wins them matching squid hats. The body of the squid is the hat part, with long tentacles that hang down around your body. Purple for her and green for Rio.</p><p>They’re really quite hideous, but as Rio puts hers on and it swallows her whole head, her chest feels impossibly warm.</p><p>Rio hands one to her and she sighs, reluctantly putting it on.</p><p>They walk around like that all day, she doesn’t even care about the <em>oohs</em> and <em>awwws</em> she gets from student as they pass.</p><p>“I used to be feared,” she grumbles when one of the girls in her class tells her they look so cute. “Now I’m <em>cute</em>.”</p><p>Rio laughs loudly as she snacks on her candy. “You’ve always been cute.”</p><p>Agatha sends her a pale imitation of her patented death glare. They never hold any real heat with Rio nowadays.</p><p>Rio simply darts forward and steals a quick kiss with a grin.</p><p>“See?” Agatha pouts.</p><p>“You’re plenty scary baby, trust me.”</p><p>As they walk hand in hand, a very large, very complicated looking rollercoaster comes into view. A large sign sits in front of it titled <em>The Grim Reaper. </em></p><p>Rio gasps when she sees it.</p><p>“Oh my god! That’s just like my favorite when I was a kid!” She turns to Agatha and starts whining like a puppy, making her eyes as big as she can and sticking out her bottom lip.</p><p>Agatha stares at her, already knowing the outcome of this, and yet trying to hold firm for a little while longer. She eventually closes her eyes and sighs. <em>As if she could ever say no to that face.</em></p><p>“<em>Fine</em>. You’re lucky I love you,” she grumbles.</p><p>Rio whoops and does a little dance, Agatha softens against her will. <em>What a dork</em>.</p><p>It’s not that she's scared. Agatha Harkness is <em>not</em> afraid of a stupid roller coaster. It’s just that… she’s never been on one. And the probability of plummeting to your death because of a big stupid metal machine is <em>not</em> zero.</p><p>Okay, so maybe she’s a little nervous.</p><p>As they wait in line, Rio rambles on about the amusement park she used to go to as a kid. Agatha tries to listen, she does, but also her heart is threatening to beat out of her chest and she can barely hear Rio over her heartbeat in her ears.</p><p>Rio notices, because of course she does, and immediately stops her story.</p><p>She puts her hand on Agatha’s forearm and rubs her thumb back and forth over her bare skin.“Hey, if you really don’t want to, we don’t have to. It’s okay, I won’t be upset,” she says seriously.</p><p>Agatha knows she wouldn’t be, she’s too sweet for that. She looks to her left and sees a child no older than nine waiting to get on the ride and her resolve hardens. She clenches her fists and takes a deep breath. No, now it’s a matter of principal. Agatha Harkness is not going to be beat by this goddamn death trap.</p><p>“If this kid can get on, so can I. I'm doing it,” she says determinedly.</p><p>Rio smiles softly. “Alright. I think you’re gonna love it, though!”</p><p>“We’ll see,” she huffs.</p><p>Half an hour later, they're being strapped in and Agatha’s poor heart is threatening to give out on her.</p><p>The ride shoots off like a rocket, looping in and out and over itself, and a minute later they’re done. Rio immediately looks over to check on her with a big smile.</p><p>Agatha starts laughing happily. “Oh my god!” she yells over the noise. “That was amazing!”</p><p>“AH!” Rio yells. “I knew you’d like it!”</p><p>They go on six more rides before the day is almost over, Agatha loving every single one.</p><p>“Okay, you’ve converted me. Congratulations,” Agatha says as they sit down to eat. Rio found them a picnic table somewhat secluded in a little woodsy area and Agatha definitely appreciates the privacy after being constantly surrounded by people all day.</p><p>“Yes! I told youuu,” she sings and Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>They enjoy a nice lunch together and Agatha is having a wonderful time until Rio says, “When we get home can we <em>please</em> finally watch The Cat in the Hat.”</p><p>“Do you have a thing for Dr. Suess or something?” Agatha laughs before freezing.</p><p><em>Home.</em></p><p>She said home. Not “my apartment” or “your house,” but <em>home</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s whole body goes warm at the idea of them having a home together. She doesn’t care where it is as long as Rio is there with her.</p><p>Rio is babbling on about how funny the movie is when Agatha interrupts quietly. “Wait… home?”</p><p>Rio stops abruptly and tilts her head. “What?”</p><p>“You said home… when we get home..”</p><p>A smile slowly creeps up Rio’s face. “Are we not living together yet?” she asks coyly.</p><p>Agatha laughs and shakes her head.</p><p>“Well I don’t know why the hell not.” She sets her sandwich down and grabs Agatha’s hand, turning her body towards her. “Move in with me.”</p><p>Agatha laughs joyfully and surges forward to kiss her hard. She threads her hand into Rio’s hair and pulls her closer. She has to remind herself to keep it PG, there <em>are</em> kids around after all, but it’s a difficult task.</p><p>“I love you so fucking much. I can’t wait to live with you,” Agatha whispers against her lips. “And Pudge.”</p><p>“Oh great, just what I need, you two ganging up on me.” Rio grumbles and Agatha giggles happily.</p><p>This is it, the beginning of their life together, and Agatha couldn’t be happier, sitting on a dirty amusement park bench with the woman she loves, planning how they’re going to redecorate their home.</p><p>And she knows things are only going to get better.</p>

<p>Rio is sleeping peacefully, buried under the fluffiest duvet she’s ever owned, curled around the love of her life, when two little knees jam into her ribcage with the force of a two ton truck.</p><p>She jerks awake and wheezes out a groan.</p><p>“Mama! Mommy! Wake up! It’s Christmas!” Nicky shrieks at the top of his lungs.</p><p>Agatha groans in front of her and shifts in her arms. “Baby, it’s too early,” she rasps as she turns on her back with her eyes closed.</p><p>Nicky throws his body over the both of them and starts wiggling wildly. “Get up! Get uuup!”</p><p>At five years old, Nicky still has no concept of letting them sleep in even a little bit. Rio looks over her shoulder at the clock on her bedside table and it reads 6:25 am. She groans.</p><p>Rio reaches out and palms his face, pulling him down in between her and Agatha, restraining his flailing limbs with her arms and legs as he giggles uncontrollably.</p><p>Agatha cracks her eyes open to watch and smiles softly. “I guess we’re up,” she says.</p><p>She suddenly shoots up in bed and lunges for Nicky, tickling his belly while Rio has him restrained. His giggles turn into shrieks of laughter as they gang up on him.</p><p>After a minute of tickling, Agatha lets him catch his breath and Rio releases him. Agatha leans down to place a soft kiss on his forehead and then Rio’s lips. “Good morning, my darlings. Merry Christmas.”</p><p>Rio looks up at her and then down at Nicky, a wave of warmth starts in her chest and explodes outwards throughout her body. She can’t believe how lucky she is to have them both, to be able to wake up to this.</p><p>Nicky practically drags them out of bed and into the living room, squealing loudly when he spots the presents under the tree. Agatha comes up behind her and wraps her arms around Rio’s waist, setting her chin on her shoulder as they watch him look through the presents.</p><p>“Yours have dinosaur paper, baby,” Agatha tells him. They stand there and take in the moment.</p><p>“He’s so cute,” Agatha whispers in her ear.</p><p>Rio turns in her arms and grins at her. “We made that.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles and leans in for a sweet kiss, both of them smiling into it. “I love you,” Agatha says quietly.</p><p>“I love you more.”</p><p>They’re staring lovingly at each other until they hear a shriek. They turn to find Nicky already beginning to open his presents. Rio chuckles but Agatha yells, “Nicky wait! I need pictures!”</p><p>She rushes out of the room to grab her phone from the bedroom, Nicky impatiently pouting until she comes back and gives him the okay to continue.</p><p>He blows through all his presents at lightning speed, immediately beginning to play with them once he’s done. Agatha and Rio turn to each other to exchange their own presents.</p><p>Agatha opens hers to find a beautiful ruby necklace she had once casually mentioned loving as they passed it in the store window. Rio had remembered, went back and got it some other time, and Agatha is touched. She feels tears build up behind her eyes and she blinks them away. Even after all these years, she’s still not used to how caring Rio can be.</p><p>Rio’s opens hers to find two tickets to Italy where they’ll be spending their thirteenth anniversary. Her head shoots up and she gapes at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha throws her head back and laughs at her reaction. “I take it you’re excited?”</p><p>Rio snaps out of it and launches into the excited rambling that Agatha absolutely adores. “Are you kidding! Oh my god, Agatha! You know Ive always wanted to go. Babe, oh my g- wait, who’s gonna watch Nicky? These say we’ll be gone for a week..”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “Wanda said they’ll take him. He definitely won’t mind a week long sleepover with Billy and Tommy.”</p><p>Rio grins and cups both sides of her face, bringing her in for a slow kiss.</p><p>“Ewww!” Nicky giggles from the floor, covering his mouth with a big smile. They both chuckle.</p><p>Nicky spends the next couple hours playing with his new toys and they have to force him to pause when it’s time to eat breakfast.</p><p>They spend the day watching Christmas movies and cuddling on the couch. How the Grinch Stole Christmas has become something of a tradition for them, Rio having hooked Nicky on it as soon as he was old enough to understand. Hell, she sat him in front of the tv to watch it before he could even speak. Something about “training him early.” It makes Agatha nostalgic as well, remembering that first year they were together.</p><p>Later in the day, Agatha leans over to whisper in Nicky’s ear, “Do you know what time it is?”</p><p>“Cookie time!” Nicky exclaims.</p><p>They bake sugar cookies for the small gathering they’ll be having later. The house smells like sweets and there’s soft Christmas music playing, creating a warmth in Rio’s chest that lingers all day.</p><p><em>This</em> is the home she’s always wanted.</p><p>As Agatha kneads the dough and Nicky sings all the wrong words to Jingle Bell Rock, Rio comes up behind her and wraps her arms around her stomach. She tucks her face into Agatha’s neck and begins humming along to the song, swaying them back and forth.</p><p>“I love you,” she whispers. “I love our family.”</p><p>Agatha smiles softly. She turns to head to press a kiss to Rio’s lips. “I love you, darling.”</p><p>A few hours later, people start arriving. Alice and Jen are first, Nicky running up to them excitedly.</p><p>“Auntie Jen! Auntie Alice! Do you want to see my new train set?!” he yells.</p><p>“Hey there big guy! Um, of course I do, duh!” Alice says, playfully rolling her eyes as she scoops him up. Jen smiles at them wistfully, no doubt imagining them having a kid of their own.</p><p>Rio comes up behind Nicky at a normal pace. “Baby, inside voices, remember?”</p><p>“Yes, mama,” Nicky whispers quietly. It’s always one or the other with him, Rio chuckles.</p><p>“Hey guys! How have you been? How’s married life treating you?” she greets them warmly, hugging them both. Nicky joining in for a group hug when she moves to hug Alice, squeezing them both tightly.</p><p>“We’ve been good!” Alice says with a smile.</p><p>“Married life is wonderful, you guys weren’t kidding,” Jen laughs.</p><p>“I believe someone has a train set to show me,” Alice says to Nicky, tickling his belly and he squeals happily.</p><p>She walks off towards the living room with him in her arms and Jen watches them go with a soft expression on her face.</p><p>“Does that look mean what I think it means?” Rio asks with a shit eating grin. “Will I be getting a niece or nephew some time soooon? she sings.</p><p>Jen smacks her arm and laughs. “Oh, shut up. Where’s your wine.”</p><p>Rio brings her into the kitchen where Agatha is checking on the ham in the oven. She stands up and smiles when she sees Jen.</p><p>“Hey! Where’s your partner in crime?” she asks</p><p>“Enjoying a train set, I believe,” Jen chuckles, moving forward to give Agatha a hug. Once Agatha and Rio started dating, Rio made sure they got over whatever petty rivalry they had. They’ve been close friends for years now, especially once Alice and Jen began dating and they started doing things as a group.</p><p>Rio pours a glass of wine for Jen and one for herself as they sit down at the island. They catch up for about twenty minutes before the doorbell rings again. Rio gets up to answer it but before she even makes it out of the kitchen, they hear loud shrieking from three small sets of lungs.</p><p>They all laugh. “Well, I guess we know who’s here,” Agatha says fondly.</p><p>Wanda and Vision make their way into the kitchen with Lilia behind them. “Look who we found outside,” Wanda says with a smile.</p><p>They all say their hello’s and Alice comes in a moment later, pouting.</p><p>“I’ve been replaced,” she huffs. Nicky clearly having forgotten about her once his friends arrived.</p><p>Wanda chuckles. “Little boys are fickle like that. You should see the twins when they go to their grandma’s house, suddenly I’m chopped liver.”</p><p>They sit down for dinner not long after, wrangling the boys into their seats at the table. It’s a lovely meal with lovely people and only one thing could make it better. Rio’s been holding it in all day and she feels like she’s going to burst.</p><p>She looks up and makes eye contact with Agatha, silently asking if it’s time, and Agatha nods with a smile. Rio grins excitedly and stands up, clearing her throat.</p><p>“Okay guys, we have an announcement.” Rio says loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>They all quiet down, looking between the two of them with curious expressions. Wanda spots Agatha’s glass of water first and her eyes go wide, her head whips towards Rio.</p><p>Rio looks at Agatha and smiles. “We’re pregnant! Again!”</p><p>The table erupts in shouts and cheers, everyone congratulating them and asking a million questions.</p><p>“Who's carrying?!”</p><p>“How far along?”</p><p>“Do you know the gender!”</p><p>Agatha chuckles as Rio sits back down. “I’m carrying, about 12 weeks, and no, not yet. Although we’re hoping for a girl.”</p><p>“I'm getting a sister!” Nicky pipes up from his seat.</p><p>“Hey, or a brother, little man. We don’t know just yet,” Rio tells him, ruffling his hair.</p><p>He pouts. “I want a sister.”</p><p>The rest of the night goes smoothly, everyone laughing and having a good time. Alice and Jen are the first to go, Wanda and Vision taking the boys next. Lilia is the last to leave, hugging them both and congratulating them once again. She’s become something of a mother figure to them both, neither of them finding one in their actual mothers.</p><p>After she leaves, Rio cleans up the kitchen as Agatha puts Nicky to bed. They’re both done at relatively the same time and they fall onto the couch with a huff.</p><p>“I’m beat,” Rio says as she lays her head against the back of the couch.</p><p>“Me too. This little lime is already playing with my energy levels. I feel like I could sleep for a week,” Agatha groans, rubbing a hand over her stomach.</p><p>Rio stands up and reaches a hand out for her. “Come on, baby. Let’s go to bed.”</p><p>Agatha takes her hand and lets her pull her up off the couch, neither of them letting go until they reach the bedroom.</p><p>Rio turns and helps Agatha undress, not in a sexual way, merely wanting to take care of her. Agatha lets herself be undressed before Rio slips a large sleep shirt over her head, telling her to slip into bed.</p><p>Rio hurries to do the same before pulling the covers back and crawling in next to her.</p><p>They settle on their sides, facing each other, both of them smiling softly. Rio reaches up and tucks a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you and our babies,” she says softly.</p><p>Agatha begins to tear up, pregnancy already wreaking havoc on her emotions, and she sends Rio a watery smile. “Me too, darling. I love you so much.”</p><p>Rio wipes a tear that had fallen out of the corner of her eye. She leans forward and places the softest kiss on her lips.</p><p>“Goodnight, my love.” She wiggles downward, pulling the blankets with her, until her face is level with Agatha’s stomach. She lifts her sleep shirt and places a soft kiss on her lower belly where Agatha is just starting to show. “And goodnight, my little love. I love you both.”</p><p>Agatha smiles down at her and brushes her hair back from her face, tucking it behind her ear. They fall asleep wrapped in each others arms, just like they do every night, both of them wondering how they got to be so lucky.</p>
