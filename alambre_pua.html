<div class="userstuff">
<p>The bouncer in front of Coven nodded at Rio when she approached the door.</p><p>“Sup, Bucky,” she said, giving him a tap on the shoulder as she passed. “How’s the crowd so far?”</p><p>He smiled, arms crossed. “Looking good. Your girl might become a hit tonight.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the proud smile tugging at her lips. She gave him a playful salute before slipping inside the bar, already pulsing with the low thrum of pre-show anticipation.</p><p>Coven had always held a special place in her heart—and Alice’s too.</p><p>It was the first place they ever went together back in college. They used to sneak out of long study nights just to stand on the sticky floor near the stage, soaking in the sound of local bands trying to make it. They saw acts go from unknowns to radio regulars within months of playing that stage.</p><p>It wasn’t just the magic of the place—it was who owned it. Lilia had a reputation for giving new talent a real shot. No clout-chasing, no industry favors, just raw music. If you had the guts to perform and something real to offer, she’d give you a spot.</p><p>When Alice’s song started gaining traction and it came time to plan her first show, there was no question where they wanted it. Coven was the beginning. The place where they both first believed it could happen.</p><p>And now, it was happening.</p><p>Alice was more than Rio’s best friend—she was her biggest project.</p><p>Her mother had been a world-renowned opera singer, and from the time Alice could hold a bow, she was being molded for the same legacy. Violin came first, cello later. Her talent was undeniable, but the joy? That had faded long ago.</p><p>Rio had met her in college, and it didn’t take long to see how caged Alice felt. She loved music, but not the version she was expected to perform. She wanted to sing, to move, to feel her own pulse in the rhythm, not just echo the ghosts of composers long gone. Even after her mother’s death, Alice clung to the classical world like a guilty tether.</p><p>Rio had been the one to cut it.</p><p>She introduced Alice to artists blending orchestral elements with pop, rock, and experimental genres. She challenged her to write her own lyrics, to reimagine her skills in a sound that felt like hers. Slowly, they built something new. Together.</p><p>Rio produced Alice’s early tracks herself, layering lush strings under crisp beats and airy vocals. Then, one day, a song caught fire online and everything changed. Offers poured in. Labels reached out. Now here they were.</p><p>Tonight was Alice’s first solo concert. And her full album—the one they were building together from scratch—was nearly done.</p><p>Rio had been working as a producer for a few years now, mostly under the pseudonym Lady Death. The name had started as a joke, something she tagged her early edits with, but it stuck. Some of her darker, moodier mixes had found their way into the hands of bigger artists, and she’d ended up on tracks with names way above her tax bracket. Still, she liked keeping her real identity private. Lady Death was a vibe, Rio was the engine behind it.</p><p>She ran her own studio now—Underworld—a gritty space in an old warehouse outfitted with top-tier gear, mismatched furniture, and the kind of mood lighting that made even the shyest singers feel like stars. She did most of her production work there and rented it to up-and-coming artists who needed a cheap place to work, but tonight wasn’t about any of that.</p><p>Tonight was about Alice.</p><p>The thought made her chest swell.</p><p>Inside Coven, the lights were low and moody, casting violet shadows against the old brick walls. The crowd was still filling in, buzzing with pre-show chatter. Rio made her way toward the bar where Carol, Coven’s longtime bartender, was polishing glasses and scanning the room like a hawk.</p><p>“Hey, trouble,” Carol greeted her with a smirk.</p><p>“Hey cutie.” Rio leaned against the counter. “You got my usual?”</p><p>“Already poured.” Carol slid a frosty bottle across to her. “You nervous for her?”</p><p>Rio took a swig, letting the cool bitterness settle her nerves. “Nah. She’s gonna kill it.”</p><p>She ducked through the hallway leading to backstage, navigating through a few tangled cords and stacked gear cases until she found Alice, pacing in tight circles like a trapped cat.</p><p>Her band—three musicians Rio had helped scout—were gathered in a quiet huddle, tuning instruments and sipping water, trying to stay loose.</p><p>Alice looked up the second Rio walked in, eyes wide and anxious.</p><p>“Hey,” she breathed. “I think I’m gonna puke.”</p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. “Please don’t. Carol will never let us live it down.”</p><p>Alice groaned, hugging her arms. “I don’t know if I can do this.”</p><p>“Yes, you can,” Rio said, stepping closer, her voice calm and steady. “You’ve played for bigger crowds than this, remember?”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “Yeah, but I wasn’t singing then. That wasn’t me—it was Bach, or Saint-Saëns, or whatever piece my mother thought would impress people.”</p><p>Rio softened. She reached out and placed her hands gently on Alice’s shoulders.</p><p>“And that’s why this is better,” she said. “Because tonight is you. This is the real Alice. And everyone out there? They’re going to love her.”</p><p>Alice blinked, her breath catching. “You really think so?”</p><p>“I know so.” Rio grinned. “You’ve been waiting your whole life for this moment. Don’t let nerves convince you it’s not yours.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes were glassy, but she nodded. “Okay. Okay.”</p><p>“You’re gonna burn this place down.”</p><p>“Metaphorically,” one of the band members chimed in nervously.</p><p>Rio gave them a thumbs-up. “Definitely metaphorically.”</p><p>The stage manager called five minutes, and the band started moving, energy shifting from nerves to adrenaline. Rio gave Alice one last squeeze on the shoulder before slipping back out toward the front of the house.</p><p>She snagged a stool near the bar, bottle still in hand, just as the lights dipped and the crowd hushed in anticipation.</p><p>And when the first haunting notes of cello rang out from behind the curtain, Rio’s heart thumped once, hard, like it already knew Alice was going to crush it.</p><p>The lights painted her like a goddess as she stepped into view, violin slung low across her back, voice velvet and power. The room shifted instantly. People didn’t just cheer, they leaned in, like they wanted to be closer to whatever magic Alice was weaving.</p><p>And Rio? She couldn’t stop watching.</p><p>Every beat, every transition, every note they’d obsessed over in the studio—it worked. But more than that, Alice worked. Her presence was magnetic. Fearless. She moved like someone who finally understood she had the right to take up space.</p><p>Rio had worked with a lot of artists over the years—some big names, some that paid the bills. But this? This was different. This was her best friend becoming exactly who she was meant to be.</p><p>The crowd was wild. By the end of the set, half the bar was screaming, the other half in tears. Alice soaked it all in like she was breathing for the first time.</p><p>The moment she came offstage, still radiant and out of breath, she spotted Rio immediately.</p><p>“I FUCKING DID IT!” she practically shouted, throwing her arms around her.</p><p>Rio laughed, catching her mid-run. “You did, Al. You killed it.”</p><p>“I’m shaking. I can’t feel my feet. Oh my God.” Alice pulled back slightly, her smile dizzy and real. “Okay, I have to talk to my manager and Lilia and probably get dragged into a hundred convos, but—don’t leave, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, breathless from secondhand adrenaline. “I’ll be here.”</p><p>Alice kissed her cheek, then darted off into the post-show chaos.</p><p>Rio wandered back toward the bar, heart still racing, the sounds of congratulations and clinking glasses surrounding her in a warm, fizzy haze.</p><p>She’d just reached for her beer when she felt it—a presence.</p><p>When she glanced to the side, she saw <em> her. </em></p><p>Leaning casually against the wall a few feet away was a woman in glossy black leather pants and a matching cropped top that shimmered under the dim bar lights. She had big, voluminous brown hair that framed her face like it had been styled by chaos and charm itself—and those piercing blue eyes?</p><p>They were locked on Rio.</p><p>She didn’t flinch when Rio looked back. If anything, she grinned. A slow, cocky smile that curled like smoke.</p><p>And then she started moving.</p><p>Gracefully. Confidently. The crowd parted for her like they somehow sensed they weren’t the main characters anymore.</p><p>She stopped beside Rio, close enough for the air to hum between them.</p><p>“Thought I’d never catch your attention,” she said, voice low and syrupy. “And here I thought I was Alice’s biggest fan”</p><p>Rio smirked, sipping her drink. If only she knew.</p><p>“Well,” she said, leaning in just a touch, “considering I’m her best friend, you could say I’ve already won.”</p><p>The woman blinked, startled. “Shut up. You’re lying.”</p><p>“Am I?” Rio raised an eyebrow, eyes glittering with amusement.</p><p>She could see the woman scanning her face, looking for the punchline. It didn’t come. Instead, her lips parted like she was about to challenge her again—</p><p>“OH MY GOD, THERE YOU ARE!”</p><p>Alice appeared once more, bounding over like the rush of a chorus drop. She wrapped Rio in another hug, full of leftover adrenaline and joy.</p><p>“I just had to say thank you again,” she said. “For everything. I know you already know this, but like—again. Thank you.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her back. “Always, Al.”</p><p>Alice pulled back and finally noticed the woman beside them. “Oh—sorry, am I interrupting?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “We were just talking.”</p><p>The woman, surprisingly flustered now, straightened. “Hi. I was just telling her how amazing you were.”</p><p>Alice smiled. “Thank you!”</p><p>There was a pause—then Alice raised an eyebrow at Rio, teasing. “Friend of yours?”</p><p>Rio gave a little shrug. “We just met.”</p><p>The woman extended her hand. “Agatha.”</p><p>Alice shook it. “Nice to meet you, Agatha. You already know my name, and this—” she jabbed Rio in the side, “—is Rio. My best friend, my producer, and the reason I didn’t run offstage crying tonight.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but her smile betrayed her.</p><p>“Well, I gotta go for real now,” Alice said. “But I’ll call you tomorrow. And Agatha—nice meeting you.”</p><p>“Likewise,” Agatha said, voice unusually soft.</p><p>Alice gave them both a quick hug, then disappeared once again into the sea of people.</p><p>Rio turned back to Agatha, who was watching her with that same spark in her eyes.</p><p>“Producer, huh?” she said, a slow smile forming again. “That explains a lot.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Like what?”</p><p>Agatha leaned in just enough to make it intentional. “Like why I couldn’t stop looking at you.”</p><p>Rio’s skin buzzed, her mouth curling into a grin. This wasn’t how she thought tonight would end, but she wasn’t complaining. Not at all.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio was nothing like Agatha expected.</p><p>She’d already noticed her before Alice took the stage—how could she not? The ridiculous tank top spelled dyke in rhinestones like a dare, tucked into black jeans and paired with the kind of boots that said <em> fight me or fuck me, your choice. </em> A leather jacket draped on the bar counter and where she leaned like she owned the building, laughing easily, bottle in hand, at home in the glow of neon and bass.</p><p>Agatha had only come to Coven for Alice’s concert. She’d followed her music online for months—intrigued by the blend of cello and synth, of raw vocals layered over strings. Alice was strange and brilliant and, frankly, overdue for a solo debut. She had been planning to go with her best friend, but Wanda had bailed last-minute with a frantic text about her dog and a missing chocolate bar and an emergency trip to the vet.</p><p>Normally, that would’ve been it. Agatha didn’t really like to go to bars alone. Especially not like this. But something in her itched to get out that night. So she went.</p><p>And then, after the show, there she was again. Talking to the bartender at the bar, still flushed from the music, with that stupid shirt and a killer smile.</p><p>When she looked at her, Agatha saw as a sign that she should approach and damn, thank God she did.</p><p>They started talking about Alice, but it didn’t take long for the banter to start. And once it started, it didn’t stop. Rio was fast, in every way. Her wit, her comebacks, her grin. She looked Agatha up and down like she was solving a puzzle.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, sipping her beer, “what do you do when you’re not intimidating people with your amazing eyes and drinking whiskey like a Bond villain?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Oh, don't you wanna guess?”</p><p>Rio took a look at her for a moment before her eyes sparkled. “Sure.”</p><p>Agatha already knew this was a rigged game, but she wanted to see Rio try anyway.</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha leaned one elbow on the bar. “You guess right on the first try, I buy you your next round. But if you guess wrong twice… you’re buying mine.”</p><p>Rio set her drink down. “That’s dangerous confidence.”</p><p>“I like my odds.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, giving Agatha a deliberate once-over—leather pants, sharp rings, sleek blazer, and unapologetic posture. She tapped her fingers against the side of her glass.</p><p>“You look like you work in fashion. Like an influencer or something”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Nice try with the flattery, but big no”</p><p>“Damn.” Rio leaned in. “Okay, second shot. Gallery curator. Like, high-end. You tell rich people why the sad red circle is worth eighty grand.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Wrong again.”</p><p>“Shit, really!”</p><p>“Yeah”</p><p>“Wait—are you in marketing?”</p><p>“God, no.”</p><p>Rio looked genuinely thrown now. “Then what? What the hell do you do?”</p><p>Agatha took a slow sip of her drink before answering, just to make her squirm. “I’m a data analyst.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “You’re lying.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“You—no. You showed up looking like that and you spend your day staring at spreadsheets?”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Pivot tables and predictive modeling, baby.”</p><p>Rio dragged her hands down her face. “I’m gonna need to reevaluate my entire perception of hot women in leather.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, and it slipped too easily into something softer—something warmer.</p><p>That was the thing. Rio had come off cocky at first, but the more they talked, the more it became clear: she was just comfortable in her skin. Playful. Smart. Every flirtation came with a smile, every tease with a sparkle in her eyes. And the way she listened—really listened—made Agatha feel like she was the only person in the room.</p><p>Eventually, they left the bar behind and moved to the back lounge, settling into one of the low velvet couches. It was dark and quieter, the bass from the speakers thudding gently beneath their conversation. They sat close. Too close to be innocent.</p><p>Rio’s arm brushed Agatha’s. Her fingers skimmed lightly along Agatha’s sleeve, just enough to make her breath hitch. Agatha shifted slightly toward her, catching the heat between them like a live wire.</p><p>“You cold?” Rio asked, her voice low.</p><p>Agatha turned her head. “Do I look cold?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said with a smirk, her fingers drifting to Agatha’s wrist. “You look like you’re trying really hard not to kiss me.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. It was pretty clear.</p><p>Rio’s fingers moved to her neck, thumb resting just beneath her jaw, and Agatha leaned into the touch without thinking. Their faces were inches apart. Their eyes locked. She didn’t know who closed the distance.</p><p>But suddenly—</p><p>Lips.</p><p>Soft at first. Careful. But the heat had been simmering between them all night, and the second their mouths met, it was like a match dropped on dry wood.</p><p>Agatha curled her fingers into Rio’s tank top, pulled her closer. Rio’s hand slid into her hair, the kiss deepening, intensifying. Tongues tangled. Teeth grazed. Rio kissed like she didn’t care who was watching, and Agatha kissed like she forgot anyone else existed.</p><p>They didn’t stop. Not for a while. Not until they were breathless, tangled against the couch cushions, faces flushed and pulses pounding.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, Agatha let her forehead rest against Rio’s. Her lipstick was ruined. Her heart was racing.</p><p>“I don’t usually do this,” she said, laughing under her breath.</p><p>Rio didn’t let go. “Is this the part where you tell me you're also a part-time assassin?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, kissed the corner of her mouth once more. “No. This is the part where I ask if you want to come back to mine.”</p><p>Rio blinked. Her expression shifted—surprise, then interest, then that same crooked smile that had knocked Agatha off-balance the minute they met.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said. “Yeah, I do.”</p><p>Agatha stood, grabbing her jacket. Rio followed, their fingers brushing, then tangling together naturally—like they'd been doing this forever instead of for one dizzying, magnetic night.</p><p>She hadn’t come to Coven looking for anyone. But walking out with Rio beside her, was definitely making the mild panic attack she had earlier worth it.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Rio had barely heard the soft click of the door closing behind them before her back met it with a solid thud, and Agatha was on her like gravity had snapped.</p><p>It was immediate, wild, and hot—mouth crashing into hers with a hunger that made Rio’s knees threaten to give out. Tongues tangled, breath hitched, and hands fumbled like neither of them had a second to waste. Somewhere between the second kiss and the third gasp, Rio laughed—half giddy, half stunned.</p><p>
<em> What the hell was she doing? </em>
</p><p>She’d had one-night stands before. She wasn’t new to this. But usually she was drunker, hazier—her memory soft and blurred by the time she stumbled into someone’s apartment. Tonight, though? Tonight she was sharp, every nerve buzzing, her skin tingling with awareness.</p><p>The only thing dizzying her was the way Agatha looked at her—like she was starving and Rio was the only thing on the menu.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio breathed, voice breaking slightly as Agatha wrestled with her jacket, still kissing her, still pressing her up against the door like she was trying to fuse their bodies together through sheer will.</p><p>Agatha growled something into her mouth, low and frustrated—something like "why is this thing so complicated?"—and Rio couldn’t help her grin.</p><p>“You know,” she teased, helping shrug off one sleeve, “this would be a lot easier if we were sitting… or, I don’t know, laying down on a bed like normal people?”</p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to glare at her, breathless and flushed. “You could be helping instead of talking.”</p><p>“Wasn’t sure if you needed help. You seemed very committed to doing this while I’m pinned to a wall.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha muttered, and kissed her again—hard enough that Rio forgot how to laugh for a second.</p><p>Then, with a firm tug on her hand, Agatha dragged her through the apartment, their footsteps staggered, frantic. It wasn’t graceful—it was messy and eager, like every step closer to the bedroom was a second too slow.</p><p>They stumbled into it like a storm, a soft purple and pink neon glow seeping through the blinds, catching on Agatha’s figure as she stripped off her jacket in a practiced shrug.</p><p>Rio's breath caught. That leather top barely qualified as clothing, and the pants looked like they’d been sewn onto her. Her mouth went dry.</p><p>“Fuck,” she said with a disbelieving laugh, stepping forward, hands sliding over Agatha’s waist. “Do you usually just walk around like this?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, slow and cocky. “Only when I want people to suffer.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, teeth grazing her lower lip. “You’re evil.”</p><p>“And effective,” Agatha replied, eyes heavy-lidded as she nudged Rio backward until the backs of her knees hit the bed.</p><p>Rio flopped down with a bounce, propped up on her elbows, grinning up at her. “So, you like control, huh?”</p><p>That earned her a roll of the eyes and a knee on the mattress. Agatha crawled over her slowly, deliberately, like a cat with something cornered. She paused just over Rio, her hair falling in waves around her face, her gaze locked and loaded.</p><p>“I should warn you,” Agatha murmured, her voice lower now, almost teasing. “I bite.”</p><p>“God, I hope so.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her like she was daring her to keep joking—deep, messy, confident. Her hands found Rio’s wrists and pinned them loosely against the bed, long enough to make a point. Rio arched into her, groaning as Agatha dragged her teeth across her jaw.</p><p>Then her hands moved—slow, curious, sliding beneath the hem of Rio’s shirt and lifting. Rio let her, watching her from under her lashes.</p><p>Agatha pulled it off completely and tossed it aside, eyes trailing down the new stretch of skin with a smug little smile. “Much better.”</p><p>Rio reached up, hand slipping beneath Agatha’s top, tugging her closer until their bodies pressed together. “You gonna let me return the favor or are you just gonna admire me all night?”</p><p>“I haven’t decided,” Agatha said, tilting her hips down just enough to make Rio gasp. “You’re very entertaining like this.”</p><p>She leaned down to bite at the spot just below her jaw.</p><p>Rio hissed. “Okay, yeah. That—fuck. Keep doing that.”</p><p>Agatha hummed against her throat, teeth scraping, lips following. One of her hands slipped under the waistband of Rio’s jeans, just enough to tease, to threaten.</p><p>Rio squirmed. “Are you this mean with everyone, or am I just lucky?”</p><p>“You’re lucky,” Agatha said, kissing a path down to her collarbone. “That I like to make people work for it.”</p><p>That did something to her—something sharp and instant. Rio grabbed her hips, flipped them without warning, and settled between her thighs.</p><p>“Your mouth’s dangerous,” she muttered, kissing down her neck. “Keep going and I’m gonna forget to pace myself.”</p><p>Agatha arched beneath her, already pulling at the back of her sports bra, nails skimming over Rio’s spine. “Who said anything about pacing?”</p><p>Rio groaned, low in her throat, and finally started working on those damn pants. “Jesus. You’re going to be the death of me,”</p><p>Agatha hummed, smug and breathless. “Why? Because I know exactly what I want you to do to me?”</p><p>That made Rio stop for a second. Not because she was thrown off—just stunned by how hot that was.</p><p>She looked down at her, pupils blown wide, fingers still hooked into the waistband. Then she smirked. “If you want to be in control… you can be.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes gleamed with hunger. She looked like a girl about to devour something sweet and messy and hers. “Bold of you,” she said, voice low and electric, “to assume you had it in the first place.”</p><p>Rio groaned like it hurt. “God, you're such a fucking brat.”</p><p>She kissed every inch of skin she could find like she was worshipping her. Her mouth didn’t just brush—it lingered, licked, teased, bit.</p><p>“But just know,” she said between kisses, “next time—I’m going to ruin you for being this smug.”</p><p>“Are you confident enough there is going to be a next time?” Agatha teased.</p><p>But her laughter turned into a gasp the moment Rio’s mouth found her—confident and hungry and utterly unrelenting.</p><p>Rio yanked Agatha’s pants down, slow and deliberate, like unwrapping a gift she’d been dying to get her hands on. She kissed down the inside of her thighs—open-mouthed, wet, hot—until Agatha was trembling beneath her. But instead of going straight for it, she sat back on her heels, smirking.</p><p>Agatha’s legs fell open instinctively. A silent plea.</p><p>But Rio didn’t move. She dragged her fingers up the soft skin of Agatha’s thigh, slow enough to frustrate. Teasing. Barely there.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. “If you keep teasing me, I’ll actually kill you.”</p><p>Rio laughed—low, dark, dangerous. “You’re cute when you beg.”</p><p>“I’m not—begging,” Agatha said, but the way her hips shifted upward said otherwise. She was already flushed, already needy, already coming apart from nothing but a look and a touch.</p><p>“You sure?” Rio asked, finally slipping her fingers between her legs—just to feel. “Because you’re soaking.”</p><p>Agatha cursed, hips jerking. “Oh fuck you”</p><p>“You will… soon,” Rio said simply. “But first I would like to take my time. Especially when someone’s been a brat this whole time”</p><p>She leaned down, lips brushing over Agatha’s inner thigh as she slid a single finger in—slow, controlled, torturously deep. Agatha moaned, low and desperate.</p><p>Rio watched her face the whole time. Watched her lashes flutter, her mouth part, her spine arch.</p><p>Then she did it again—this time curling her finger just right.</p><p>Agatha’s whole body jolted. “Fuck, don’t stop. Don’t you dare stop—”</p><p>Rio grinned mischievously, pulling her finger out slowly. Agatha opened her mouth to fire back, but then Rio added a second finger. And whatever insult she was about to throw got swallowed by a moan so filthy it made Rio groan under her breath.</p><p>“Oh, baby,” she murmured, mouth trailing up to Agatha’s stomach, her voice gone to smoke. “Look at you. Squirming already.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha gasped. “Just—please.”</p><p>Rio curled her fingers again. Agatha gasped louder.</p><p>“See? So pretty when you beg” Rio whispered, pressing a kiss just below her ribs. “It sounds so good on you.”</p><p>Agatha was practically writhing now, heels digging into the bed, hands grasping at sheets and air and anything that might ground her.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t done yet.</p><p>She moved her fingers in steady, precise strokes, watching every reaction—every twitch, every tremble, every soft sound that escaped Agatha’s lips.</p><p>And then she leaned in and let her mouth join her hand. The first swipe of her tongue on Agatha's neglected clit made her choke on a moan, head falling back, eyes rolling shut.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she gasped, voice breaking apart. “Rio—”</p><p>Rio moaned into her, the vibration making Agatha jolt again. Her fingers never stopped. Her mouth didn’t relent.She wanted to break her in the best way. Wanted to give Agatha everything she asked for and more—exactly how she wanted it.</p><p>Agatha came hard—legs shaking, hands in her hair, thighs trying to squeeze around Rio’s head. But Rio held her there, fucked her through it with mouth and fingers and heat until she was trembling, undone, gasping for breath.</p><p>Her body was still trembling, sprawled across the bed with her hair fanned out like something from a dream. But Rio wasn’t done. Not even close.</p><p>She was obsessed with the way Agatha fell apart—how responsive she was, how her hips twitched with the lightest touch, how her breath caught on every teasing stroke like Rio had access to some switch inside her. She’d never had someone this sensitive to her touch. And fuck, she loved it.</p><p>Rio let her fingers drift across Agatha’s stomach, featherlight, just to see her shiver again. Then she leaned in and pressed a kiss above her navel, smiling when Agatha let out a soft, involuntary gasp.</p><p>“Look at you,” Rio murmured, voice low with awe and something darker. “All it takes is one touch and you’re already shaking.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her fingers fisted in the sheets, her chest rising and falling in quick, shallow breaths. Rio watched her for a second, completely enthralled.</p><p>“You look so pretty,” she whispered, dragging her mouth along Agatha’s ribs, warm lips against warm skin. “It’s like your body wants to give in to me.”</p><p>She kissed her way up to Agatha’s breast, tongue flicking over a nipple until it pebbled beneath her mouth. Agatha moaned, loud and raw, and Rio groaned softly in response, aroused by the sheer intensity of it.</p><p>“You like that?” she asked, even though she already knew the answer.</p><p>Agatha nodded desperately, mouth parted like she couldn’t find the words. Rio cupped her other breast, teasing the nipple with slow, firm pinches until Agatha arched into her hand, caught in the tension between too much and not enough.</p><p>“You’re so sensitive,” Rio whispered. “It’s fucking addictive.”</p><p>She took her time. Let her hands roam, down Agatha’s sides, across her hips, along the soft inside of her thighs, just to feel the way her muscles twitched and jumped, how her breath hitched with every inch she claimed.</p><p>And when Rio finally slid her fingers between Agatha’s legs again, slow and reverent, she felt how wet she still was. Practically dripping.</p><p>“So wet for me” she said, dragging her fingers through it, letting them circle Agatha’s clit with maddening slowness. “God, you’re a dream.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered.</p><p>“I barely touch you and you’re already shaking.”</p><p>Then she slid two fingers inside, slow but deep, and Agatha cried out, high and desperate. Her walls clenched around Rio instantly, and Rio’s eyes fluttered shut at the feeling.</p><p>“Fuck,” she breathed. “How are you still so tight?”</p><p>Agatha writhed beneath her, her head tossed back, hands clutching at the sheets again. Rio could feel how close she already was, how every stroke of her fingers drew her tighter, more breathless.</p><p>And it turned her on so much—the way Agatha’s body answered her, how she seemed to instinctively know how to push her toward the edge.</p><p>“You make me want to ruin you,” Rio whispered, leaning close to press the words against Agatha’s neck. “Over and over again. Just to watch what it does to you.”</p><p>Agatha moaned in response, her back arching as Rio’s fingers found that perfect angle again. Her other hand moved up, cupping one breast, teasing the nipple as her lips brushed over flushed, damp skin.</p><p>“Come on, baby,” she whispered, thrusting harder now, fingers relentless. “Let go for me”</p><p>Agatha obeyed with a sob, her whole body trembling violently as her orgasm crashed over her again. She clenched hard around Rio’s fingers, thighs shaking, mouth open in a soundless cry that made Rio’s whole body throb with arousal. Rio held her through it—whispering, kissing, touching her like she never wanted it to stop.</p><p>When she finally stilled, Rio pulled back to look at her—flushed, dazed, sweaty, gorgeous.</p><p>“You good?” Rio asked, trying and failing not to look too smug.</p><p>Agatha blinked up at her like she couldn’t remember how to speak. Then she let out a breathless laugh.</p><p>“Don't get cocky” she said, a little breathless.</p><p>Rio smirked. “Kinda hard not to when you're looking like that”</p><p>“Like what?” Agatha asked, arching a brow.</p><p>“Wrecked,” Rio taunted.</p><p>Agatha reached up, pulled her into a kiss that was all tongue and promise.</p><p>“Shut up” she breathed.</p><p>Rio was still smirking when Agatha surprisingly flipped them around, pushing her onto her back with intent. The kind of intent that made heat flash low in her belly.</p><p>“You think you’re so charming,” Agatha murmured, straddling her hips, hair a mess and lips swollen. “teasing me like that.”</p><p>Rio licked her lips. “Worked, didn’t it?”</p><p>Agatha leaned down, their mouths nearly touching. “Oh, you think you're getting away with that attitude?”</p><p>Her fingers skated up Rio’s stomach. A soft touch—warm, featherlight—but it still made Rio shiver. Then Agatha’s other hand curled around her throat.</p><p>Not squeezing. Just resting.</p><p>Claiming.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat. It was like her body reacted before her brain even had time to register. The flash of heat. The tight pull in her core. The way her thighs pressed together without thinking.</p><p>And Agatha noticed. Of course she did.</p><p>She paused, eyes narrowing. “Well, well.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, probably to deny it, play it cool, but then Agatha applied just a little pressure. Nothing dangerous. Barely anything at all.</p><p>But Rio’s brain short-circuited.</p><p>Agatha smirked, a devil in soft skin. “So that’s what does it for you?”</p><p>Rio glared, her voice embarrassingly breathless. “Shut up.”</p><p>“Mmm, no,” Agatha purred, her fingers tightening just a little more—just enough to make everything inside Rio flicker. “Not now that I know.”</p><p>She shifted her weight and slid down Rio’s body, dragging her nails just under the band of her underwear. Her touch was fire and ice, and Rio’s whole body jerked in response.</p><p>“Be good,” she said, voice low and velvety. “Or I’ll make you beg.”</p><p>“What if I want to?” Rio managed, though the defiance in her voice was unraveling.</p><p>“Of course you do,” Agatha scoffed, eyes sparkling. “Don't worry, you will.”</p><p>She kissed her again—slow, unhurried. Then her lips moved down, and down, and down. Not in a straight path, but detouring with intent. She started at Rio’s throat, nosing into the sensitive spot just below her jaw before trailing slow kisses along her neck. She let her tongue drag deliberately across the hollow there, feeling Rio’s pulse flutter beneath her mouth.</p><p>“You always get this worked up from a little kissing or seeing me come make you this wet?” she teased, voice low against Rio’s skin.</p><p>Rio growled something unintelligible in response, but her fingers were already curling into Agatha’s hair..</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>Then she moved lower—slow, exploratory. Her mouth found Rio’s breast, licked around a nipple before sucking it into her mouth, rolling it with her tongue, letting her teeth graze just enough to make Rio’s hips jump. She gave the same attention to the other side, her hands sliding along Rio’s waist, fingertips barely pressing, tracing lazy shapes down to her thighs and back up again.</p><p>Agatha was methodical. Patient. Not in a hurry. She was learning Rio’s body with the kind of curiosity that felt like worship and the kind of control that felt like torture.</p><p>Rio was already flushed. Already breathless. But Agatha hadn’t even touch her anywhere near she wanted.</p><p>Then her mouth dropped lower, tongue brushing just above where Rio was craving. She kissed her there, slow and maddening.</p><p>And paused.</p><p>“You want my mouth?” she asked softly, lips just barely grazing her. “Say please.”</p><p>Rio exhaled hard. “Fuck you.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. Then she moved. Her mouth was warm, wet, deliberate. She licked with intent, starting slow and steady, building rhythm, learning what made Rio gasp and twitch and buck. She flicked her tongue fast then slow, then flattened it just to see Rio shake. Her fingers found their place inside her—two at once, smooth and deep—and curled with perfect precision.</p><p>Rio moaned, arching hard. Her hands scrambled to grab onto something, anything, but all she found was Agatha’s head between her thighs and the throb that built and built like a tidal wave in her spine.</p><p>Agatha didn’t just give pleasure—she orchestrated it. She pulled it out of Rio in pieces. Drew it up like music, a steady climb. And every time she felt Rio start to climb too fast—too close—she backed off just enough to keep her suspended.</p><p>“I hate you,” Rio groaned, voice hoarse.</p><p>Agatha looked up from between her legs, lips shining. “No, you don't”</p><p>She leaned in again—this time even slower, her fingers curling deep, her tongue moving in tight circles that made Rio see stars. She didn’t speak now. Just let her mouth do all the talking—pulling Rio apart with every grind of her tongue and press of her fingers.</p><p>Then, without warning, her hand slid up again—one hand still fucking her open, the other pressing to her throat.</p><p>Not hard. Just firm.</p><p>And Rio nearly lost it.</p><p>It was like her brain short-circuited. Her mouth fell open. Her hips jerked. That hand on her neck wasn’t choking—it was grounding her, claiming her, owning her, and somehow it made everything feel sharper. More electric.</p><p>“You like that, don't you?” Agatha asked, her voice all silk and smug satisfaction. “God, you’re soaked.”</p><p>Rio whimpered something that might’ve been a yes. Agatha’s grip on her neck pressed tighter.</p><p>“Say it,” she whispered. “Tell me you want to come.”</p><p>Rio whimpered. Felt herself unraveling. “I—I want to—fuck—please—”</p><p>Agatha rewarded her instantly.</p><p>She pushed her fingers deeper. Pressed her mouth hard. And Rio shattered. Her orgasm ripped through her like a current, full-body and consuming, the kind that made her forget where she was, who she was, anything except the way Agatha was touching her like she’d been built for it.</p><p>She sobbed out a moan, hips twitching, eyes wet, completely and utterly undone. And still Agatha didn’t let her go.</p><p>She worked her through it. Drew it out. Dragged another whimper, another wave, until Rio was nothing but molten limbs and weak gasps.</p><p>And when it was finally over—when her body was limp and her chest was heaving and her throat felt raw from moaning—Agatha kissed her cheek, then her jaw, then her mouth.</p><p>“Not so smug anymore, huh?” she murmured against her lips.</p><p>Rio laughed—wrecked, breathless, stunned. And then she tilted her head just enough to look her in the eye, something raw and honest in her voice.</p><p>“You're acting like I’m not exactly where I wanted to be” she whispered, still catching her breath.</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>And the look she gave her wasn’t just hunger. It was reverent. Delighted. Possessive.</p><p>“Careful, honey,” she said, dragging her fingers down her ribs with a touch so light it made Rio twitch, “I just might take advantage of that”</p><p>And who was Rio to say no to a hot woman wanting to wreck her?</p><p>She let out another soft laugh and reached up, fingers curling in Agatha’s hair, pulling her down for another kiss.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what time she’d fallen asleep. The last thing she remembered was Rio’s hand draped over her hip and the way her own body still trembled from being used—thoroughly and with great enthusiasm—multiple times before they finally knocked out.</p><p>But when she woke up to sunlight creeping in through the gaps in the curtains and a low hum of city noise in the distance. Her body felt deliciously heavy, limbs sprawled across the bed like she’d melted into the mattress overnight.</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly, then groaned, stretching, she felt sore in all the right places.</p><p>It wasn’t until she rolled over that she realized the other side of the bed was empty. The pillow was cold. The sheets rumpled but untouched since early morning.</p><p>Agatha frowned, propping herself up on one elbow and glancing at the bedside clock.</p><p>11:47 AM.</p><p>Figures. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d slept in this late, but she also couldn’t remember the last time she’d had that much sex. That much fun. That much chemistry with someone she’d met barely a few hours before they were tangled in bed together.</p><p>She sighed, running a hand through her messy hair, trying not to feel too… <em> something </em> about the fact Rio was already gone.</p><p>It was one night, she reminded herself. An amazing one, sure, but still just one night.</p><p>Even so, she couldn’t help the small flicker of disappointment in her chest. She would have loved waking up to warm skin and sleepy kisses and maybe another round before she had to go.</p><p>Still, if all she got was the memory of last night? Totally worth it.</p><p>Agatha swung her legs over the edge of the bed, still naked, and padded across the room to where she’d left her purse. Her body protested with every step, her thighs sore, her hips a little stiff. She smirked to herself as she dug through her things for her phone.</p><p>“Thank you, Rio,” she muttered under her breath, the ache between her legs making her grin a little wider.</p><p>She found her phone at the bottom of her bag, but something else was tucked underneath it.</p><p>A piece of torn paper.</p><p>Agatha froze for a beat before tugging it out.</p><blockquote>
<p><em> Sorry, I forgot i had to meet Alice and I didn't want to wake you, but text me so I can make it up to you. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> R </em></p>
</blockquote><p>And beneath that, a number.</p><p>Agatha bit her bottom lip, the smile pulling back onto her face before she could stop it. There was something bold and confident about the note, just like the woman who wrote it. No apology beyond the necessary, no awkward qualifiers. Just an invitation.</p><p>
<em> Text me so I can make it up to you. </em>
</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart,” Agatha murmured to herself, plopping down on the edge of the bed and unlocking her phone, “you’re going to regret writing that.”</p><p>She typed the number in quickly, saving it under the contact name:</p><p><strong><br/>
</strong> <strong>Rio</strong> 🍆💦</p><p>Then she stared at it for a second, laughing to herself, before backing out and opening her conversation with Wanda.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
so i had sex with the hottest woman i’ve ever met and i think she ruined me in ways i won’t recover from 😃</p><p>Wanda was typing before Agatha even had the chance to put her phone down. She ignored it for now.</p><p>Message sent, she looked back at the note still sitting beside her. Folded it neatly. Slid it into her phone case, like a tiny insurance policy.</p><p>She didn’t know if she’d see Rio again. But she wanted to.</p><p>And maybe, if she played it right, last night wouldn’t be the last time she got wrecked by that stupidly hot, smug, charming woman with the filthy mouth.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip.</p><p>Yeah. She was definitely texting her. But first she needed coffee. And some Advil.</p><p>Twenty-five minutes later, freshly scrubbed and wrapped in one of her fluffiest towels, Agatha padded barefoot through her apartment, hair damp and wild around her shoulders. She’d taken her time in the water, letting the steam do its thing, trying to calm the weird giddy buzz still humming in her chest.</p><p>There was a lightness to her limbs now. A soreness, yes, but it felt earned. Delicious. Like waking up after a victory.</p><p>She brewed coffee. Took two Advil. Sipped from the mug as she leaned against the counter, phone in hand. For a moment, she just stared at it, thumb hovering.</p><p>Then she smiled—sharp, a little evil—and started to type.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
so, are you planning to stick around next time or do I have to handcuff you to my bed?</p><p>She took a sip of her coffee, barely tasting it. Three seconds later, her phone buzzed.</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
You should be thankful I gave you the right number, otherwise that would’ve been a very weird thing to text a stranger.</p><p>Agatha let out a soft laugh, her eyebrows lifting. But before she could say something else, another message appeared.</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
btw, you had handcuffs this whole time and didn't say anything yesterday?</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
<img alt="" height="400" src="https://i.ibb.co/HLGpGL8Z/IMG-5520.jpg" width="300"/><br/>
didn't think I would have to use it<br/>
after all you were being so good for me<br/>
but I guess if you play your cards right, we can use it next time</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦 </b><br/>
I thought you said I was being too confident for saying there was going to be a next time</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
well<br/>
you did say you were making up to me</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
you're right<br/>
I did<br/>
so what can I do to see your gorgeous face again?</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
hmm<br/>
i’m open to suggestions</p><p><b>Rio🍆💦</b><br/>
are you free on Friday?</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
depends<br/>
what exactly do you have in mind?</p><p><b>Rio🍆💦</b><br/>
dinner<br/>
somewhere with real glasses, cloth napkins, and good food</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
that sounds dangerously close to a date</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
it can be<br/>
if you want it to</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
i’ll decide after I see where you're taking me</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
fair<br/>
but to be completely honest<br/>
if you wear anything like yesterday i might have some trouble behaving</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
well i guess you will have to start working on your self-control</p><p><b>Rio🍆💦</b><br/>
fuck<br/>
why do you have to make everything so hot?</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
it's a skill<br/>
or maybe you're just horny</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦 </b><br/>
kinda hard not to<br/>
i’m feeling like Raven’s visions<br/>
but it’s just flashes of last night<br/>
thighs. nails. your voice.<br/>
you get the idea</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
you're ridiculous</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
i'm not<br/>
but you wanna know it is?<br/>
<img alt="" height="533" src="https://i.ibb.co/G4gW0Y9V/IMG-5538.jpg" width="300"/><br/>
showing up to brunch with my best friend with a hickey on my neck</p><p align="right"><b>me</b> <br/>
poor thing<br/>
but I did warn you and you were not complaining yesterday</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
yeah, i know<br/>
anyways, Alice saw them before I did, so i’ll probably never stop hearing about it</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
would sympathize with your sob story if I didn't have to take two advils today just to be able to walk again</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
damn<br/>
that actually made me feel better<br/>
I’m feeling really proud of myself now</p><p> </p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
<img alt="" height="400" src="https://i.ibb.co/8DTGh9w8/IMG-5543.jpg" width="300"/><br/>
at least you gave me a chance to just lazy around today</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
fuck<br/>
don't do that</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
what? 😇</p><p><b>Rio🍆💦</b><br/>
you know<br/>
I just stopped thinking about last night<br/>
and then you had to go and bring it all back</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
that’s too bad<br/>
especially considering you’re the one who bolted without even saying goodbye</p><p><b>Rio🍆💦</b><br/>
ouch<br/>
I would never do that unless I had a real reason</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
yeah yeah</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
I mean it<br/>
next time I promise I’ll stay<br/>
might even make you breakfast if you’re good enough</p><p>Agatha let out a soft scoff, tossing her phone beside her on the couch for a second before replying.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
no promises</p><p><b>Rio🍆💦</b><br/>
brat</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she couldn't help but smile.</p><p>She spent most of the day letting her muscles recover while she lounged around her apartment. She stayed curled up with a book she wasn’t really paying attention to, flipping pages without retaining much, more focused on the sunlight stretching across the floor than whatever the protagonist was whining about.</p><p>Every so often, her phone buzzed with a text from Rio. No conversations really developed, just little drops of attention, lazy and casual and frequent enough that Agatha felt smiling.</p><p>She ignored Wanda’s text most of the day, mostly out of self-preservation. But by late afternoon, she knew if she didn’t answer soon, Wanda would probably bust through her door.</p><p align="right"><strong>me</strong><br/>
yes, I’m alive<br/>
will tell you everything soon</p><p><b>Wan 🍓</b><br/>
what do you mean soon???<br/>
need the details<br/>
you know i've been living vicariously through you 😭</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
and that was supposed to change yesterday, but you bailed on me 💀</p><p><b>Wan 🍓</b><br/>
first of all i had an emergency<br/>
and most import you got laid because of that<br/>
so why am i being punished???</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
because you're nosy<br/>
and because i’m too tired to do this now<br/>
but we can meet up sometime this week, ok?</p><p><b>Wan 🍓</b><br/>
damn<br/>
that good, huh?</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
a lady don't kiss and tell</p><p><b>Wan 🍓</b><br/>
please<br/>
we both know you're not a lady<br/>
and you love to tell everything</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha decisively ignored her best friend after that.</p><p>By nighttime, she was showered, stretched out in bed, and contemplating whether she had the energy to rewatch a movie or just let Netflix’s ambient fireplace play in the background again.</p><p>She was just about to put her phone down when it buzzed one last time.</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b><br/>
you asleep?</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
not yet<br/>
why?</p><p>There was a pause, then:</p><p><b>Rio🍆💦</b><br/>
just wanted to say goodnight</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>
dream about me</p><p><b>Rio🍆💦</b><br/>
god, i hope i do 🥵<br/>
goodnight, gorgeous</p><p>Agatha snorted softly and tucked the phone against her chest for a moment before setting it on her nightstand. She drifted off a few minutes later, smiling without even realizing it.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p> </p>

<p>“What the fuck is wrong with you?”</p><p>Kate’s voice sliced through the fog of Rio’s thoughts like a bucket of cold water.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio blinked, pretending like she hadn’t just been zoning out. “Also, I’m still your boss, don’t talk to me like that.”</p><p>Kate rolled her eyes and crossed her arms, the picture of exasperated youth. “Well, you’re not exactly paying attention to your job, so technically you’re being unprofessional first.”</p><p>Rio sighed and swiveled her chair around to fully face her assistant. “Is there a particular reason you’re taunting me in my studio?”</p><p>“I came to tell you that Alice’s record label called asking if you can be in a meeting there this week,” Kate said, nodding toward the blinking voicemail light. “But you’ve been staring at that looped harmony for the past five minutes. Like. Five actual minutes.”</p><p>“Schedule it for tomorrow,” Rio said with a sharp wave of her hand.</p><p>Kate raised an eyebrow. “Should I also bring you a fan and some tissues for whenever your mystery girl texts again?”</p><p>Rio shot her a look. “Out.”</p><p>“I’m just saying—”</p><p>“Out, Kate.”</p><p>With a dramatic groan, Kate backed out of the room, muttering something about awful code of conduct in this company.</p><p>To be fair, she wasn’t wrong.</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair, eyes on the ceiling, letting out a long breath. She had been distracted—painfully so—and it had been going on since Friday. Or, more accurately, since the moment she’d kissed Agatha.</p><p>They’d been texting casually since Saturday morning, and Rio had been caught off guard by how quickly Agatha had wormed her way into her mind. She was smart—terrifyingly smart—and sharp in the kind of way that made Rio want to argue with her just to see what would happen. But she was also hot. Distractingly hot. And even worse, flirty. In this unpredictable, dry-humored, devastating kind of way that kept Rio off balance.</p><p>There was no telling what Agatha would say next. No pattern to follow, no script. It was maddening and kind of addictive.</p><p>Just as Rio caught her mind drifting again, her phone buzzed on the table.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> 🍒<br/>had to go to the office to do a presentation for one of our clients and the guy almost popped a boner lol</p><p>Rio snorted so hard she nearly dropped the phone. She started typing a reply, grinning, her heartbeat picking up just a little—like it always did when Agatha's name lit up her screen.</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>well, at least he must have been happy with the results, huh?</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒<br/></b>i think he wasn't paying attention enough to have any opinion about the detailed report i did to show the increase on the performance of his employees</p><p>Rio let out a low groan, dropping her head back against her chair.</p><p>God, this really shouldn’t be hot.</p><p>She is a music producer, for fuck’s sake. She lived for distortion layers, vocal loops, and tempo shifts. The only time she ever thought about numbers was when she was syncing a beat or cursing at a plugin for not exporting right.</p><p>But Agatha…</p><p>Agatha could talk about anything and Rio would probably be leaning forward, nodding like she actually understood. There was something completely ridiculous about the way Agatha could casually drop phrases like "departmental restructuring success rate" and suddenly Rio was pressing her thighs together and trying not to fantasize about Agatha doing presentations in a tight pencil skirt and glasses.</p><p>It was messed up. But it was also kind of amazing. Agatha being a fucking nerd had definitely made Rio more horny than she should. She would sit through an entire corporate meeting just to watch her talk.</p><p>She thumbed her screen, typing:</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>i’m kinda convinced you could turn a pie chart into foreplay<br/>are you proud of yourself, nerd?</p><p align="right"> </p><p>She was already bracing herself for whatever snarky comeback Agatha would send next.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> 🍒<br/>that's because you know i’m hot<br/><img alt="" height="423" src="https://i.ibb.co/whYTMCgT/IMG-5547.jpg" width="300"/><br/>this was what i was wearing btw</p><p>Rio stared at the photo for a beat too long. Then again.</p><p>Then typed without thinking:</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b> okay i get the guy now<br/>the only increase i care about right now is in my need to have you immediately</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒<br/></b> you’re ridiculous<br/>we’re seeing each other in two days, you’ll survive</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b> i’m not so sure about that<br/>honestly thinking of filing an hr complaint against you for workplace distraction<br/><br/></p><p><b>Agatha🍒<br/></b> I don't even work with you lol<br/>also. i take no responsibility for your inability to focus</p><p>Rio flopped back in her chair, grinning like a teenager with a crush. Which, she supposed, was dangerously close to how she actually felt. Agatha is going to be the death of her.</p><p>Unfortunately, she had work to do. So she forced herself to shake the heat off her cheeks and focus again.</p><p>The project she was working on wasn’t exactly thrilling, but once she fell into the rhythm of measurements, revisions, and render previews, everything else melted into the background. Hours slipped by unnoticed, and her phone sat untouched on the edge of her desk, forgotten for once.</p><p>When she finally looked up, her stomach gave a little lurch. It was nearly 9 p.m.</p><p>With a groan, Rio stretched her arms overhead, spine cracking from the way she'd hunched over for way too long. She started shutting everything down, already fantasizing about the leftover pasta waiting for her in the fridge.</p><p>Only when she grabbed her phone and saw the notifications did she remember the rest of her world existed—specifically, Agatha’s part of it.</p><p>One unread message.</p><p><br/>Sent nearly an hour ago.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> 🍒<br/><img alt="" height="533" src="https://i.ibb.co/5XSL9m1M/IMG-5581.jpg" width="300"/><br/>only way to recover from a day at the office</p><p>Rio tapped the image.</p><p>And nearly dropped her phone. The whole scene was so warm and intimate it made Rio’s chest ache. Of course Agatha would do this. She was unreal.</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b> fuck<br/>can’t believe i’m only seeing this now<br/>are you trying to kill me???<br/>because it’s working</p><p>She stared at the photo again, biting her lip. Agatha really wasn’t going to let her live.</p><p>Even after locking up the studio and heading to her car, Rio couldn’t get the image out of her mind. It was the casual intimacy of it. The way Agatha never seemed to try, and yet always knew exactly what would undo her.</p><p>The whole drive home, Rio found herself zoning out at red lights, her thoughts circling back to the way the shadows clung to Agatha’s skin. She wondered what book she was reading. If she had music playing in the background, and what kind of songs Agatha liked to choose when she was alone like that.</p><p>By the time Rio parked, her phone buzzed again. She didn’t need to check to know who it was.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> 🍒<br/>no idea what you’re talking about</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but there was no stopping the smile that crept onto her face.</p><p>Smartass.</p><p>She walked up to her apartment, shoulders relaxing more with each step, that cozy feeling settling somewhere behind her ribs.</p><p>She kicked off her sneakers, dropped her bag by the door, and collapsed onto the couch with her phone still in hand. Another message came through.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> 🍒<br/>did you stay at the studio until now?</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b> <img height="420" src="https://i.ibb.co/9mtx1gPH/IMG-5693.jpg" width="300"/><br/>yeah, just got home<br/>i’m beat</p><p><b>Agatha</b> 🍒<br/>you know<br/>i was trying to sleep like a responsible adult<br/>how am i supposed to do that now when this is what you send me?</p><p>Rio blinked at her screen, eyebrows lifting. She was about to type something equally snarky when yet another message came in.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> 🍒<br/>looks comfortable tho<br/>I would definitely love to sit there</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio stared at the screen, a slow grin pulling at her lips.</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>on my couch?</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒<br/></b> nah<br/>there's a better seat right there</p><p>Rio sank further into the couch, fingers tightening around her phone. The grin wouldn’t leave her face if it tried. She could practically hear Agatha’s voice in her head—playful, innocent, and clearly anything but.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>yeah?<br/>wanna come sit on my lap, baby?</p><p>The moment she hit send, her heart thudded faster. There was a thrill behind the words, but also something grounding in it, a challenge wrapped in endearment. She waited—barely a minute—before Agatha replied.</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b><br/>i thought you were beat<br/>shouldn’t you be resting?</p><p>Rio exhaled a soft laugh, tilting her head back against the couch cushion.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>i was<br/>then you started talking about straddling me and now i’m wide awake</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b> <b><br/></b> straddling, huh?<br/>interesting word choice</p><p>Rio bit her bottom lip. Her mind was already running through the scene, imagining Agatha’s knees on either side of her thighs, that devilish little smirk, the way her fingers would find purchase against Rio’s shoulders like she belonged there.</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒<br/></b> should i go slow?<br/>take my time settling in…<br/>make myself comfortable</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>you asking for permission<br/>or just painting me a picture?</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b><br/>i’m pretty sure i don't need to do either of that</p><p>That made Rio curse under her breath.</p><p>She shifted on the couch, heat curling low in her stomach. Her skin was suddenly too warm beneath her clothes, like Agatha’s words alone had reached through the screen and tugged at her.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>you’re trouble<br/>you know that, right?</p><p><strong>Agatha 🍒</strong><br/>well, you’re the one making it very hard for me to be good</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>i don’t want you to be good right now</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒<br/></b> yeah?<br/>would you let me use you?<br/>ride you until i feel good</p><p>Rio made an actual sound—somewhere between a groan and a whimper—and tossed her head back into the couch cushion, hand flying to cover her face. Jesus. Her heart was pounding. Her entire body was suddenly coiled tight, every nerve alive like Agatha had just climbed into her lap right there and whispered it in her ear.</p><p>She stared at the screen, her thumb hovering, thoughts scrambled. Then she typed.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>you know i would<br/>i’d let you take whatever you wanted from me<br/>however you wanted</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b><br/>mhmm<br/>you’d just sit there and take it?<br/><br/></p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, legs shifting under the weight of her own arousal. Her fingers tightened around the phone.</p><p align="right"><strong>me</strong><br/>i don't think i would be able to watch without touch you</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b> <b><br/></b> mmm<br/>and you think i would let you?</p><p>Rio’s stomach flipped.</p><p align="right"> </p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>so you want me to behave?<br/>sit still while you grind on me like that?<br/>use me like your toy?</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b><br/>exactly<br/>you’d be so good<br/>letting me move how i like<br/>touch myself while i ride you<br/>so shameless</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. The image Agatha gave her playing in a loop on her mind.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>i’d watch every second<br/>memorize every sound<br/>you’d make a mess of me<br/>and i’d thank you for it</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b><br/>you should<br/>i would make sure to whisper in your ear how desperate i am<br/>how wet i am<br/>how close i’m getting</p><p>Rio’s legs squeezed together involuntarily. Her whole body thrummed with heat.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>fuck, baby<br/>you’re killing me</p><p><strong>Agatha 🍒</strong><br/>i bet you’d love it<br/>me whimpering your name<br/>until i finally fall apart</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, staring at the screen like it might combust in her hand. Her head was spinning, and she could feel how wet she was by the way her boxers were clinging uncomfortably. But she didn't want to jerk off, she wanted Agatha there, doing all of that to her.</p><p>So without thinking she typed:</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>fuck<br/>do you want to come over?<br/>i need you so bad right now</p><p>There was a pause. A heartbeat. Then:</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒<br/></b> yeah?<br/>ask nicely then</p><p>Rio groaned.</p><p align="right"> </p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>please</p><p><br/><b>Agatha 🍒<br/></b> you’re so easy, baby<br/>but i really need to go to sleep</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>you did not just do that</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b><br/><img alt="" height="533" src="https://i.ibb.co/1GMCvccQ/IMG-5691.jpg" width="300"/><br/>i absolutely did<br/>tucked in, cozy, very much done for the night<br/>😴💤</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>AGATHA</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b> <b><br/></b>😇</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>you dragged me through hell just to leave me like this?</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b><br/>i guided you through a beautiful fantasy<br/>you’re welcome</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>you’re a monster<br/>a smug, evil temptress<br/>with no remorse</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b><br/>you’re the one who said i could take whatever i wanted<br/>i wanted your attention<br/>and now i’ve got it<br/>all night long</p><p>Rio stared at her phone, flustered and furious and fully, absolutely turned on. She swore softly under her breath and let her head fall back.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>you’re lucky you’re hot<br/>go to sleep before i grab my keys and drive to your place to wreck you</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒</b><br/>goodnight, baby<br/>hope you dream about me 😘</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>goodnight, brat</p><p>Rio cursed again, half-laughing, half-whimpering. She locked her phone and let it rest on her chest, a grin tugging at her lips no matter how hard she tried to smother it.</p><p>She let her head fall back against the couch, heart thudding, a dazed laugh escaping her lips. What a fucking menace.</p><p>Rio was officially not getting any rest tonight.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Agatha was focused—fully in the zone. The kind of locked-in state that only came after two double espressos and an untouched to-do list she actually wanted to tackle. Her office was quiet aside from the occasional click of her mouse and the muted hum of the AC. The campaign data was finally starting to make sense. She barely noticed how tense her shoulders had gotten or how long she'd been hunched over her desk until Wanda’s sudden entrance nearly knocked her soul out of her body.</p><p>“I thought I told you to stop doing that,” Agatha snapped, clutching her chest as she glared at her best friend.</p><p>Wanda, utterly unbothered, just grinned and plopped herself down dramatically onto the couch Agatha kept in her office for moments exactly like this.</p><p>“Yeah, and you also told me to rescue you if you’d been staring at spreadsheets for more than two hours without blinking,” she said, stretching her arms behind her head. “I texted you thirty minutes ago, by the way. I said I was coming to drag your sorry ass to dinner.”</p><p>Agatha reached for her phone automatically, muttering, “Shit,” when she saw Wanda’s unread message—and the texts that had slipped past her while she was working.</p><p><b>Wan</b> 🍓<br/>leaving now. if you don't answer me in 10 min i’m breaking in</p><p>And then:</p><p><br/><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/>still thinking about what you did yesterday</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio’s message for a second too long—long enough that Wanda caught the way her expression shifted, and sat up like a predator catching the scent of fresh meat.</p><p>“Oh my God, was that her?” Wanda asked, already grinning. “Please tell me that was her.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, locking her phone. “You’re unbearable.”</p><p>“I’m delightful, and you know it,” Wanda said, standing just to follow Agatha into her room like an overexcited puppy. “So, the mysterious sex goddess is still on your mind, huh?”</p><p>“She has a name,” Agatha muttered, pulling open a drawer.</p><p>“Which I still don’t know,” Wanda reminded her smugly. “All I know is you met at Alice’s concert, you two fucked nasty and now you’re smiling at your phone every time it vibrates.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, grabbing a sweater. “Her name is Rio and we’ve been talking. A little…”</p><p>Wanda dramatically fanned herself. “Oh, she’s got you bad.”</p><p>“Please,” Agatha scoffs. “You’re being delusional,”</p><p>“Am I? You brought someone home. You never do that.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It was the heat of the moment”</p><p>“That’s one word for it,” Wanda said, grinning.</p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda laughed, clearly delighted by how fast she could get on Agatha's nerves. “I’m just saying. You flirt with everyone but you never bring people back here. You even said that's how you avoid having to deal with women clinging at your place afterwards and making you get the ick”</p><p>“And I stand by that” Agatha said without looking at her best friend. “You can take this as me doing an empirical research”</p><p>“You're so fucking full of shit” Wanda said trying not to laugh. “Don't pretend you're not acting all giddy when she texts”</p><p>As if on cue, Agatha’s phone buzzed on the nightstand. She snatched it before Wanda could reach for it.</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/>also, that wasn’t a complaint.<br/>would definitely love to get back to that soon</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>Wanda was already leaning in. “Don’t be selfish. Read it out loud.”</p><p>“Nope,” Agatha said, turning away, but she couldn’t stop the smile that tugged at her mouth.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened. “Oh my God. Did she just sext you?”</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b> i bet you had fun after i went to sleep<br/>and i will think about it</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Nope,” she said firmly to Wanda, pushing her out of the room. “Shoes. Door. Burgers. Now.”</p><p>Wanda groaned dramatically, but followed with a smirk that said this is not over.</p><p>By the time they slid into a booth at their favorite burger place, the city had cooled down and Agatha was slightly more relaxed.</p><p>Her stomach was finally quiet, and the smell of fries helped. Until Wanda leaned her elbows on the table and said, “So. Rio.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look up from her menu. She should have known Wanda wouldn't let this go.</p><p>“What about her?”</p><p>“You tell me.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then shrugged. “I already told you all there was to say. We fucked, she bailed and now we’ve been talking. It’s been fun.”</p><p>“That's it? No plans to see each other again?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “We’re… having dinner tomorrow.”</p><p>Wanda's eyes sparkled. “Like a date dinner?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, already tired of this conversation. “I don’t know if it’s a date.”</p><p>“Do you want it to be a date?”</p><p>Agatha glanced up sharply. “You’re so annoying.”</p><p>“That’s not a no.” Wanda leaned back, looking way too pleased. And when Agatha didn't say anything else she added. “So you like her.”</p><p>“I don’t know her.”</p><p>“But you’re curious.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She fiddled with a straw wrapper, trying to look unbothered. “I guess. I like texting her. It’s easy.”</p><p>“And hot,” Wanda added, chewing a fry.</p><p>Agatha shot her a look. “Don’t get excited. We’ve known each other for a week. For all I know, dinner might be a disaster and we never see each other again.”</p><p>“Mhm,” Wanda said with a mouthful, clearly not believing that for a second.</p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed again. She lifted it and froze—this time, her smile bloomed a little slower.</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/><img alt="" height="524" src="https://i.ibb.co/QFVHGSPT/IMG-5711.jpg" width="300"/><br/>i’m still stuck at the studio<br/>that should be a good reason for you to cheer me up</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b> cute<br/>but i’m not rewarding your bad work habits</p><p>Agatha bit back another smile, completely ignoring the fact that she had been working until just a few minutes ago and tucked the phone away before Wanda could pounce.</p><p>“What?” she said preemptively.</p><p>“Nothing,” Wanda narrowed her eyes. “just wondering why you're flushed”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“You’re totally blushing.”</p><p>“Eat your burger.”</p><p>Wanda grinned. “You’re so gone.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but even she couldn’t deny the little flutter in her chest.</p><p>The rest of dinner passed with Wanda being as nosy as ever, and Agatha deflecting every question like a professional. She didn’t want to admit how much she was enjoying talking to Rio. Or how she’d kept checking her phone under the table, even when there were no new notifications.</p><p>By the time she got home, Agatha had taken off her makeup, precariously tying her hair, and was standing in front of her closet debating if she actually needed pajamas or if she could just sleep in her underwear.</p><p>She was halfway through brushing her teeth when her phone buzzed again on the counter.</p><p>She wiped her mouth and leaned over to grab it, unlocking the screen with a swipe of her thumb.</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/><img alt="" height="400" src="https://i.ibb.co/DdyJpR7/IMG-5598.jpg" width="300"/><br/>thank god the chinese place next to my house was still open 😭</p><p>Agatha snorted, It was ridiculous how much joy a blurry, poorly lit photo could bring her.</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b> at least that looks good<br/>i can’t really judge because wanda had to come rescue me and take me to dinner</p><p><b>Rio🍆💦<br/></b>so you just using every girl you know to pay for your dinner now?</p><p><b>me<br/></b> ofc<br/>what's the point of being this hot if I don't get at least a free meal?<br/>and you haven't brought me dinner yet</p><p><b>Rio </b> 🍆💦<br/>brat 🙄<br/>what did you guys get?</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/><img alt="" height="533" src="https://i.ibb.co/81n0z4x/IMG-5694.jpg" width="300"/><br/></b>just burgers</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/>damn<br/>that look delicious<br/>how was your day?</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b> little boring<br/>but at least i got a lot of work done<br/>wbu?</p><p align="left"><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/>same<br/>are you ready to sleep?</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/><img alt="" height="534" src="https://i.ibb.co/tdZYj9w/IMG-5599.jpg" width="300"/><br/></b>just getting ready to bed</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/>fuck<br/>why do you keep doing this to me? 😩</p><p>Agatha smirked, finally getting in bed and stretching under the blankets.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>i’m not doing anything this time<br/>you're just horny</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/>i hope you know i’m going to get you back for edging me the whole week</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>god i hope so<br/>goodnight, loser</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/>goodnight, gorgeous</p><p>Agatha blinked at the screen, that one word settling somewhere soft and stupid in her chest. She tucked her phone under the pillow, rolled onto her side, and let herself smile, small and private, before closing her eyes.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Rio’s day had started great.</p><p>She was up by 6:30 and at the gym by 7, hoodie pulled low and playlist loud. Her trainer was out sick, but that didn’t stop her. She ran intervals on the treadmill until her lungs burned, then moved to weights, feeling every rep in her arms and back. There was something satisfying about it—sweat, silence, and the illusion of balance.</p><p>Back at her apartment, she showered, made some breakfast and answered a handful of emails Kate had flagged as important.</p><p>By the time Rio left for the studio, she felt ahead of the day. She texted Agatha on her way.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>good morning, gorgeous<br/>I’m picking you up at 7:30<br/>dress comfy<br/>i’ll text when I’m on my way, okay?</p><p>She was even smiling when she stepped inside the building, where she had a half-finished mix from last night waiting for her. Rio liked mornings in the studio because it was usually just her and the track, headphones on, fingers dancing across knobs and sliders.</p><p>She locked in. Tweaking levels, re-recording a synth loop, humming through a couple possible vocal layers. Almost didn't see Kate arrive with lunch around 12:30, she barely noticed until a salad and smoothie were shoved in front of her.</p><p>“I can't believe my job is to feed a workaholic 35-year-old,” Kate complained.</p><p>Rio leaned back just long enough to smirk. “Do you want me to find someone else for the job?”</p><p>Kate rolled her eyes, glanced at the project screen, and caught a glimpse of Rio checking her phone.</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒<br/><img alt="" height="366" src="https://i.ibb.co/60hBnGKp/IMG-5713.jpg" width="300"/><br/></b>i have a shit ton of things to do<br/>and was forced to spend 2 hours in a meeting that could have been an email 💀<br/>hope your day is going better than mine</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b> sorry to hear that<br/>at least you're going to see me later<br/>that's definitely going to make your day better</p><p>“At least mysterious girl makes you take breaks now”</p><p>Rio tried to play it cool. “I have no idea what you're talking about”</p><p>“Yeah, right” Kate said, grinning as she backed out the door.</p><p>By midafternoon, the mix was sounding clean. Rio was finishing up bounce passes when her phone buzzed with a message from Steve.</p><p><b>Steve [Avengers Records]</b> <b><br/></b> any chance you can come in today?<br/>Yelena wants to go over stuff in person. urgent.</p><p>Rio frowned. She had agreed to work with another artist from Avengers because Alice had signed up with them. Usually she prefers to work with independent artists, but she knows big companies like that put a lot of money in her bank, so every once in a while, she accepts an offer if she feels the artist is not an asshole.</p><p>She’d only met Yelena the day before—a new Russian artist Avengers Records had just signed. The kind who didn’t smile much, probably wore vintage leather in July, and refused to shake hands. But Rio had liked her. She’d been intense, sure, but also sharp and creative. A little volatile in the way artists sometimes were, but she hadn’t struck her as a diva.</p><p>Still, Rio knew what this was.</p><p>The label wanted her for this project, badly. And the deeper they pulled her in, the harder it would be to say no.</p><p>She stared at the message, thumb hovering. She should’ve said no. Instead, she sighed and replied.</p><p align="right"> </p><p align="right"><b>Me</b><br/>on my way.</p><p>She told Kate she would have to head out and that she could go home when she was done, because she would probably just go home from there.</p><p>Then she grabbed her bag and called an uber already dreading what was waiting for her.</p><p>Avengers’ office was its usual organized chaos—exposed beams, guitars lining the walls, glass meeting rooms full of half-finished coffees and people arguing about tour budgets. Steve met her at the front, trying and failing to look collected.</p><p>“Yelena’s in a mood,” he muttered. “Just… do that calm-down thing you do to Alice. Be your Lady Death self or whatever.”</p><p>“Got it,” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>He led her into Studio B where Yelena was on the couch, sunglasses still on, arms crossed. She looked like she’d been sitting there stewing for an hour.</p><p>“They gave me garbage,” she said flatly, before Rio could even say hi. “I’m not doing garbage. You need to fix this or I walk.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Hi, nice to see you too.”</p><p>Yelena just pointed to the console like it was infected. and what followed was four and a half hours of pure, unfiltered chaos.</p><p>The mix she was angry about wasn’t even Rio’s work, obviously—it was a pre-production pass someone else had thrown together for internal review. But Yelena had fixated on it. Every frequency offended her. Every kick felt “cheap.” She contradicted herself constantly: brighter, no darker. more reverb, no less. And she wanted Rio to fix it.</p><p>So she did.</p><p>Bit by bit, Rio stripped it down. Built it back up from the bones. Not because she liked it—she didn’t—but because it felt like putting out a fire in slow motion. At least once an hour, Yelena would scoff, pout, or take a smoke break without warning. Her accent sharpened with every complaint.</p><p>It wasn’t until Rio finally played the reworked version that the girl gave a small nod and muttered, “Fine. That doesn’t make me want to vomit.”</p><p>High praise.</p><p>By the time she stepped out of the studio, the sky was completely dark. Her back ached. Her head throbbed from the constant loop of sound. Her hands were still shaking faintly from the combination of adrenaline, stress, and the insane amount of Red Bull and cold brews she’d downed during the session.</p><p>She pulled out her phone—and froze. It was almost 10 pm.</p><p>That’s when she found just 3 unread texts from Agatha among the chaos of her other notifications.</p><p><b>Agatha 🍒<br/></b> are you actually picking me up or should i get ready for something else?<br/>is everything okay?<br/>ykw, i got it.</p><p>Rio felt her stomach drop.</p><p>“Fuck,” she muttered, standing still on the sidewalk.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>agatha, i’m so sorry.<br/>i just saw this.<br/>everything exploded with a project i just got pulled into.<br/>i should’ve messaged you.<br/>but i didn't know it was going to take this long</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>No response. She stared at the screen, willing it to change.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>i swear i didn’t mean to stand you up.<br/>i really want to see you.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>She stood there a second longer, then called a cab. Not toward her own place, but toward Agatha’s.</p><p>She didn’t know what exactly she was doing, but she knew she needed to fix this.</p><p>Yeah, she knew they only knew each other for a week, but getting to know Agatha had been fun so she’d been genuinely excited to see her tonight and she would hate to lose her chance because of this.</p><p>She got to Agatha’s building by 11 p.m., with a takeout bag in her arms from the Chinese place across the street, hoping dumplings, noodles, and eggplant stir-fry would count as a peace offering.</p><p align="right"> </p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>i’m outside.<br/>i brought food.<br/>can we talk?</p><p>Nothing. She stood there with the bag, awkward, heart pounding, wondering if she should’ve just gone home and sent flowers tomorrow.</p><p>She knocked lightly. Still no answer. Rio let out a breath and set the bag down gently in front of the door.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>i’m sorry<br/>I’m going to leave the food here.<br/>at least you can't say I've never brought you dinner.</p><p>She turned and walked slowly toward the elevator, hoping the joke wouldn't make Agatha more pissed.</p><p>But when she was halfway down the hall she heard the door click open behind her.</p><p>Rio turned, heart pounding.</p><p>Agatha stood barefoot in pajama shorts and an old MIT t-shirt, arms crossed. Her eyes were cold, but not angry.</p><p>“You don’t even know if I’ve eaten,” she said.</p><p>Rio held up her hands. “Educated guess?”</p><p>A long pause.</p><p>Then Agatha stepped aside.</p><p>“Come on, I wanna see if you got my order right.”</p><p>Rio nodded and walked back, unsure what to say next, too afraid of screwing this more.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Agatha walked back to the couch where she’d left her half-empty glass of wine, now slightly warm, and watched as Rio came in and dropped the takeout bag on the coffee table without a word.</p><p>She looked like hell. Hair messy, shoulders tense, wearing a shirt that had definitely seen better days. And Agatha had half the mind to feel bad for her.</p><p>But mostly, she felt tired.</p><p>She’d spent the past few hours mentally cursing Rio, cycling through all the stages—annoyed, worried, then back to annoyed again. This wasn’t the version of the night she’d envisioned. Not by a long shot.</p><p>When she started the day, there had been something close to giddiness buzzing beneath her skin. It was ridiculous, really.</p><p>But Rio had started to have that effect on her.</p><p>Agatha had let herself lean into the anticipation—just a little. She did her makeup, tried on three different outfits before settling on one, even picked out nice jewelry. It was stupid, probably, but for a few minutes, it had felt good. Hopeful, even.</p><p>And maybe that was the problem.</p><p>Because when the clock ticked past eight and there was still no Rio—no call, no text, not even a lazy emoji—something inside her cooled.</p><p>By 8:30, she was out of the dress and back in her favorite pajama set. By 9, she’d poured herself a second glass of wine and folded herself into the couch like she was trying to disappear inside it. Arms crossed. Glass in hand. Phone face-down, so she wouldn’t be tempted to check it again.</p><p>She hated waiting. Hated what it did to her.</p><p>Worse than that, she hated the version of herself that waited. The one who sat there imagining how the night could go. The one who thought maybe, maybe, this thing with Rio wasn’t just casual.</p><p>That was the part she really resented, because she should have known better. She always knew better.</p><p>She’d crafted her life around avoiding this exact feeling. Guard up. Control locked.</p><p>Always a step ahead. And yet, there she was—mascara still sitting on the bathroom counter, her phone screen smudged from checking it too many times, and a knot in her stomach she couldn’t wine away.</p><p>At some point in the night, when the wine had started to simmer inside her, she found herself wishing Rio would at least message her, not to explain, not to apologize, but so she could just to offer an out. Shift gears.</p><p>Say, skip dinner, come over.</p><p>Sex. Something physical. Something easy.</p><p>That, at least, would’ve felt familiar. Salvageable.</p><p>Because this? Sitting around like she was hoping for something else—something more—was the exact kind of vulnerability she’d built her life avoiding. And it was her own fault for letting it happen.</p><p>Because from the start, this thing with Rio had been different. It hadn’t followed the script. She didn’t move like other people. She crept in through side doors and open windows, careless and charming, and by the time Agatha realized she might’ve let something real in, it was already too late.</p><p>And real meant dangerous.</p><p>Because real didn’t last. Not for her. Real meant disappointment, failure, watching something you wanted decay into something you resented.</p><p>So now, with Rio finally in front of her, looking exhausted and guilty and trying to smooth things over, Agatha forced herself to breathe slowly.</p><p>She eased down into the couch, lifting her wineglass as if none of it touched her. As if she wasn’t balancing on the knife-edge of something sharp and deeply familiar.</p><p>Rio sat down. Close, but not enough to touch her, Agatha could see she was nervous.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said, her voice low and sincere. “I didn’t mean to disappear. They called me in last minute—they needed help with the artist I just agreed to produce for, and—”</p><p>Agatha cut her off gently, but firmly.</p><p>“Listen,” she said, shifting comfortably into the cushions like she wasn’t thinking about how long she’d been waiting. “It’s okay. You got busy. These things happen. I get it.”</p><p>She saw the beginnings of a smile on Rio’s face, soft and hopeful.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t done.</p><p>“I just don’t like creating expectations,” she added, voice smooth. “That’s where the fun dies.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her right away. She picked up her glass again and took a slow sip, letting the pause stretch. She needed the delay, the distance, to keep her voice from cracking.</p><p>“Last week was amazing,” she said finally. “And I’d love to keep doing that. But I think there’s no reason to turn this into anything it doesn’t have to be.”</p><p>She turned her gaze to Rio now, trying to assess her expression before her final cut, but her face remained unreadable.</p><p>“We can keep this casual. Text each other when we’re in the mood to fuck. No pressure.”</p><p>
<em> No pretending. </em>
</p><p>She crossed one leg over the other and tried to make it sound like a business proposal. Something neat. Clean.</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed slowly. “So what? You want to be fuck buddies now?”</p><p>Agatha forced herself not to flinch.</p><p>“Yeah,” she replied simply. “Friends with benefits, if you want. I like having sex with you. You’re nice to talk to. I just don’t want to spoil the fun by adding something else to it. If we both know what this is, then no one’s getting disappointed.”</p><p>She watched Rio closely, trying to figure out if she was going to be able to call her bluff or walk away altogether. A small part of her almost wanted that. At least it would be over, cleanly.</p><p>But instead, Rio let out a slow breath—almost a sigh—and reached for her, pulling Agatha into her lap and kissing her like she didn’t want to waste another second arguing.</p><p>She kissed her with a hunger that felt closer to need than want, cupping Agatha’s jaw like she was trying to anchor them both.</p><p>“Let me take care of you, baby,” Rio murmured against her skin, her lips brushing Agatha’s throat as she spoke, not demanding, just offering. Steady. Solid. Certain.</p><p>And Agatha didn’t hesitate. She didn’t push back. Didn’t even pretend to. Her hands slid to Rio’s shoulders, her fingers curling in the soft fabric of her shirt like it was the only thing keeping her tethered.</p><p>Because finally, she didn’t have to think anymore.</p><p>Didn’t want to challenge or tease or control the pace like she always did, like she had to. She just wanted to let herself forget.</p><p>To let herself <em> feel </em>.</p><p>And Rio seemed to understand that without a single word.</p><p>There was no smirk when Agatha let herself fall back against the pillows later. No cocky comment when she didn’t immediately take charge. Just a quiet look, something heavy and focused in Rio’s eyes, and then her hands were on her—confident and sure, guiding rather than coaxing.</p><p>She kissed Agatha like she was trying to memorize the shape of her mouth. Slow and deep, then messy and gasping, tongues tangling in a rhythm that made Agatha whimper. She didn’t care how needy she sounded anymore. She didn’t care about anything except how good it felt to be kissed like that. like she was wanted, but more than that, like she was known.</p><p>Rio’s hands were everywhere, but not greedy. She moved like she had nothing to prove, like she already knew exactly what would make Agatha fall apart. And maybe she did.</p><p>Because Agatha was already coming undone. The drag of fingertips along her side. The scrape of Rio’s teeth on her collarbone. The way she kissed her way down her chest like she was trying to carve a path into her skin. It was all too much, and not enough, and exactly what Agatha needed.</p><p>She didn’t fight for dominance the way she had the first time. Didn’t flip Rio over or grip too tight or try to outpace her. That first night had been electric, yes, but also sharp and laced with tension. A battle disguised as sex.</p><p>And maybe that had been fun at the time, maybe it had made them both burn hot and fast, but it hadn’t felt like this.</p><p>This was something else.</p><p>She let her knees fall open easily. Let Rio settle between her thighs without so much as a twitch of resistance. She didn’t try to control the rhythm or the tempo. She didn’t try to tease back when Rio mouthed at the inside of her thigh or looked up at her with dark, hooded eyes.</p><p>She just gave in.</p><p>And Rio didn’t push. Didn’t comment. She just leaned in, tongue firm and slow, dragging over sensitive skin with the kind of care that made Agatha’s hips stutter and her fingers tighten in the sheets. Her breath came out in shudders, and she moaned, loud and unfiltered, her head tipped back, mouth falling open.</p><p>Rio didn’t let up. Didn’t tease. Didn’t make her wait. She just gave.</p><p>Again. And again.</p><p>Until Agatha wasn’t thinking about anything except the press of lips on her skin and the way her stomach kept tightening, coiling, releasing under Rio’s touch. Until her mind was blissfully blank, emptied of anything that wasn’t the next gasp, the next moan, the next sharp, glorious rush of pleasure.</p><p>And even when she was spent and panting, Rio didn’t stop.</p><p>She kissed her way back up her body, slow and reverent, her hands smoothing over Agatha’s hips like she was trying to soothe every nerve she’d just lit on fire. She hovered over her, kissing her soft and open-mouthed, like she didn’t mind that Agatha was still shaking underneath her.</p><p>Agatha let her. Let her hold the reins. Let herself be kissed and touched and taken care of. Because in that moment, she didn’t need to be anything else.</p><p>Not the woman with the sharp tongue. Not the one who called the shots. Not even the one who proposed this whole no-strings arrangement. Just a body. Just sensation. Just breath and skin and heat.</p><p>And Rio, whispering her name like it was the only word she knew, pulling her under again.</p><p>Agatha stopped counting how many times she came. Stopped trying to orient herself. She let herself drift in it—held, consumed, undone—until she couldn’t remember why she needed to feel like this in the first place.</p><p>Until there wasn’t anything on her mind anymore.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The next morning, Agatha woke up sore in a way that made her stretch like a cat and wince with satisfaction. It wasn’t the dull ache of stress or bad posture, it was the good kind. Her limbs heavy, her hips sore, her mouth still faintly swollen.</p><p>But the bed beside her was empty.</p><p>She blinked into the soft morning light, the haze of sleep lingering as her hand reached across the mattress instinctively.</p><p>Cold sheets. No Rio.</p><p>Her stomach sank.</p><p>She sat up slowly, pushing hair out of her face, dragging a hand down her neck.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>She shouldn’t be surprised. That was the deal. No strings. No morning-after expectations. Still, the absence was sharper than it should have been.</p><p>Agatha caught herself scanning the room for any trace left behind, her shirt on the chair, a phone charging, but it looked exactly as it had before Rio arrived last night, minus the slightly crooked lamp and a trail of Agatha’s clothes on the floor.</p><p>She inhaled deeply, forcing the sharp edges of disappointment down.</p><p>But then the sound of a cabinet slamming. Followed by a muffled curse. The scrape of a chair. The shuffle of feet.</p><p>She blinked again.</p><p>That wasn’t the sound of someone leaving.</p><p>That was the sound of someone <em> staying. </em></p><p>She slid out of bed, wrapped herself in a robe, and padded barefoot to the door. A soft morning breeze filtered through the apartment’s half-cracked window. Her skin felt warm and raw and too aware.</p><p>And when she finally got to the kitchen, she found Rio half-crouched in front of the fridge, her messy hair sticking up to her neck curling up a little, wearing nothing but her boxers and a gray tank that hung low on her shoulders and clung to the lines of her body like a second skin.</p><p>Agatha paused in the doorway, quiet.</p><p>Rio was muttering to herself about eggs, or maybe bread, with her head stuck in the fridge and her slender legs braced wide for balance. The muscles in her thighs tensed as she shifted, and Agatha’s eyes followed the lines upward, the tank rising just enough to show a strip of her lower back and those impossible abs.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek. Hard.</p><p>It would’ve been easier if Rio weren’t so stupidly attractive in the morning. If she were the kind of person who looked groggy and disheveled instead of casually gorgeous and ridiculously built. It would’ve been easier if Rio didn’t look like she belonged in this kitchen, barefoot and half-naked, like she had every right to be here.</p><p>Like she’d done this before.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the doorframe and cleared her throat. “Making yourself at home?”</p><p>Rio didn’t startle. She just stood up with a carton of eggs in one hand and an unbothered smirk. “You didn’t exactly leave me a breakfast menu.”</p><p>Agatha lifted a brow. “So you decided to raid my fridge?”</p><p>“I’m improvising.”</p><p>“You don’t even know where the pans are.”</p><p>Rio stepped to the cabinet and, without hesitation, pulled one out. “Sure I do.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, crossing her arms. “Have you done this before?”</p><p>“Used a kitchen?” Rio asked innocently, cracking an egg into the pan. “Yeah. Once or twice.”</p><p>Agatha hated how easily Rio slid into her space. How she moved like she belonged in it. And how that made something twist in her chest. She folded her arms tighter.</p><p>Rio turned the stove on and leaned her hip against the counter, looking way too smug for someone still wearing boxers with Snoopy on them.</p><p>“You’re staring,” she said without looking up.</p><p>“I’m judging.”</p><p>“You say that,” Rio said, cracking another egg, “but your eyes have been locked on my thighs for a solid thirty seconds.”</p><p>Agatha made a sound halfway between a scoff and a laugh. “Please.”</p><p>“You want me to put pants on?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes dragged up Rio’s body, deliberately slow. “I want you to finish cooking so I can eat and kick you out.”</p><p>“Harsh.”</p><p>“You want honesty or a cuddle?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I’ll take honesty. I’m better at handling it.”</p><p>She was doing it again, keeping it light, toeing the line without ever crossing it. There was no expectation in her voice, no suggestion this morning meant anything more than food and a goodbye. She didn’t mention last night. Didn’t say Agatha’s name like it meant something. Didn’t lean in too close or ask for anything more.</p><p>It was infuriating.</p><p>Agatha turned and grabbed two mugs, more to have something to do than anything else.</p><p>She could feel Rio behind her, heat rolling off her bare skin, and tried not to think about how warm her hands had been the night before, how her mouth had moved like it knew every inch of Agatha’s body by instinct.</p><p>Rio’s voice came low behind her. “You always look this wrecked in the morning after, or am I that good?”</p><p>Agatha turned slowly, tilting her head. “You’re a menace.”</p><p>Rio leaned closer. “You didn’t seem to mind last night.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved despite herself. “That was last night.”</p><p>“And this is…” Rio trailed off, eyes dropping to Agatha’s mouth. “...definitely the morning.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse jumped. She didn’t move.</p><p>Rio’s fingers brushed lightly against her hip, just enough to make Agatha lean into the contact. It was a tease. A spark. A challenge.</p><p>“You keep looking at me like that,” Agatha warned, “and I’m going to do something we’ll both regret.”</p><p>Rio’s grin turned wicked. “Yeah? Like what?”</p><p>“Like try to kill you with a blunt knife, asshole”</p><p>“Please, don't threaten me with a good time,”</p><p>Agatha grabbed the hem of Rio’s tank and pulled her in by it, their bodies flush in one fluid motion.</p><p>“You're ridiculous,” she murmured. “I forgot you actually get off on me being mean to you”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. Her hand came up to Agatha’s waist, easy and unhurried. “I mean...how could I not?” she said, voice soft and cocky and wrecked all at once. “you look so hot when you're pissed”</p><p>Agatha laughed under her breath. “That mouth is going to get you in trouble.”</p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed just under the edge of her robe. “Promise?”</p><p>The tension snapped taut. Their bodies were already angled into each other, every line touching, the kitchen impossibly still around them. Agatha’s heart thudded so hard she was sure Rio could feel it.</p><p>But Rio didn’t kiss her. She waited.</p><p>Agatha hated how good she was at this. At restraint. At giving just enough and not a drop more.</p><p>Agatha could pretend it was casual. She could pretend this was just about sex.</p><p>She just wasn’t sure how long she could keep pretending.</p><p>Still, she refused to give in. Not yet. She let go of Rio’s shirt, stepped back, and turned toward the kitchen island with an air of exaggerated nonchalance.</p><p>“You’re lucky I’m starving,” she said instead.</p><p>Rio snorted. “So grumpy before coffee. It's kind of hot.”</p><p>“Shut up”</p><p>“Please,” Rio said, grabbing two plates, “now you're just making this too easy for me to say make me”</p><p>Agatha purposely ignored her after that.</p><p>They sat at the kitchen island, the smell of fresh eggs and toast and too-strong coffee thick between them.</p><p>Comforting. Warm.</p><p>Agatha tried not to think about how natural it all felt. Sitting there in her robe, her bare legs brushing against Rio’s under the counter.</p><p>“You didn’t have to do this,” she said at one point, trying not to sound too grateful.</p><p>Rio just shrugged. “I know, but I didn't wanted to risk seeing you hangry first thing in the morning,”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she was smiling behind her coffee mug.</p><p>After they ate, Rio started clearing the dishes. “I’ll wash,” she said, already at the sink.</p><p>Agatha stood. “You cooked. That means I clean.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “I wanted to cook. That doesn’t mean you have to—”</p><p>“I’m not arguing,” Agatha cut in, nudging her out of the way with her hip. “This is my kitchen. I do things my way.”</p><p>Rio put her hands up in mock surrender, but didn’t leave. She stayed close. Too close.</p><p>Agatha tried to focus on the dishes, but Rio leaned in to put something on the drying rack, her chest brushing against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>And then again when she reached around to grab a towel. Her fingertips grazed Agatha’s lower back. Soft. Slow. Deliberate.</p><p>“You’re hovering,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p>“Just supervising,” Rio murmured. “You looked like you were about to drop that mug.”</p><p>“I wasn’t.”</p><p>“You sure?”</p><p>“Don’t test me.”</p><p>But Rio was testing her. Every soft touch, every smirk, every casual lean against the counter—it was all a slow, calculated unraveling.</p><p>Agatha set down a plate with more force than necessary and turned to face her. “Do you ever know when to quit?”</p><p>Rio leaned in, voice low, eyes dark with amusement. “Not really my thing.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. Her pulse spiked.</p><p>God, the fucking nerve that woman had.</p><p>The fact that she looked insanely hot in the morning-light, abs peeking out from under her loose tank, arms flexed just enough to make Agatha’s brain go static wasn't helping either.</p><p>And she was so close Agatha could practically feel the tension between them.</p><p>Agatha didn’t think. She just moved. One sharp step forward, one hand flat against Rio’s stomach to push her back—hard—until she hit the counter.</p><p>Rio blinked at her, surprised but pleased. Very pleased.</p><p>Agatha braced a hand beside her waist, holding her there.</p><p>“You think you’re clever?” she asked, voice all smoke.</p><p>Rio grinned. “I’m liking my odds so far”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes dropped to her lips. Her collarbone. Her abs. That stupid grin.</p><p>She wasn’t wrong.</p><p>And Agatha had officially run out of reasons to keep pretending she wasn’t going to do something about it.</p><p>“Fine,” she muttered. “You want trouble?”</p><p>Rio raised a brow, waiting.</p><p>And Agatha kissed her like she had been thinking about the whole morning.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Rio trailed kisses along Agatha’s throat. Her hands slipped under the hem of her robe, finding familiar curves, soft skin that made her chest tighten with something she didn’t dare name.</p><p>“You’re insatiable,” Agatha breathed, gripping the counter behind her as Rio pressed a thigh between her legs.</p><p>“You said casual,” Rio whispered against her collarbone, “not boring.”</p><p>But just as Agatha reached for the hem of Rio’s shirt, ready to pull her in completely, a shrill ring echoed from the living room.</p><p>Rio groaned and dropped her forehead to Agatha’s shoulder, reluctant to let go. She ignored it, dragging her lips along the slope of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>The phone rang again.</p><p>“Just answer it,” Agatha said softly, not unkindly. “It might be important.”</p><p>Rio wanted to say nothing was more important than what they were doing, but the words got caught in her throat. Because she remembered what Agatha had told her the night before. No expectations. No pretending.</p><p>This was all she was going to get.</p><p>She sighed and stepped back, already missing the warmth of Agatha’s body as she walked back to the living room. Her phone was still where she left it on the couch.</p><p>A missed call from Steve, and a message blinking on her lock screen.</p><p><b>Steve [Avengers Records]<br/>
</b>Hey, you going to be at Underworld today? Alice saw Yelena struggling this morning and said maybe it’s good to let her stretch a little outside the label.<br/>
We’ll pay whatever you want<br/>
just let me know.</p><p>Rio dragged a hand down her face. She had barely started working with them and they were calling in favors already.</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/>
</b>Yeah, swing by after lunch.<br/>
I’ll be there by 2</p><p>Rio let out a breath and dropped her phone back on the couch. When she looked up, the kitchen was empty.</p><p>She found Agatha in the bathroom, bare legs against the cool tiles, about to step into the shower.</p><p>“I’m guessing you have to go,” Agatha said without turning, her voice light.</p><p>Rio nodded, eyes trailing the curve of Agatha’s back as her robe fell from her shoulders. She looked up just in time to see Agatha smirking at her in the mirror.</p><p>“Do you have time to join me before you go?”</p><p>“If you want me to,” Rio said, even though her body was already moving, feet pulling her closer like she didn’t have a choice.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, just hooked her fingers in the hem of Rio’s tank top and tugged it up.</p><p>Rio followed her into the shower without thinking.</p><p>So what if it took her a way too long shower and 2 really inconvenient missed calls from Kate for her to leave Agatha's apartment?</p><p>It wasn't like she was stalling.</p><p>And she definitely wasn’t smiling when she finally made it to Underworld around 2:30 p.m. with her hair still damp, her knees a little bruised and wearing one of Agatha’s old t-shirts.</p><p>The fabric was soft from too many washes. Lavender scent clinging to the collar like a whisper. The hem hit a little higher, riding up every time she adjusted her bag strap. It felt like a hug, a secret, a dare.</p><p>Rio had to actively focus not to let her brain spiral into Agatha territory again.</p><p>Inside, Yelena was already mid-story, arms slicing the air as she spoke to Kate with an animated intensity Rio hadn't seen on her before.</p><p>Kate looked fully enraptured, nodding like her life depended on it.</p><p>“Hey guys, sorry I’m late,” Rio said, dropping her bag with a thud.</p><p>Yelena straightened like she’d been caught watching porn at work. “No problem,” she said way too fast. “Kate was keeping me company.”</p><p>Kate choked on her water.</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “Thank you, Kate.”</p><p>Kate wiped her mouth. “No problem, boss.”</p><p>Rio gave Yelena a look and tilted her head toward the back. “Let's go?”</p><p>Unlike the day before, the session went well. Smooth. Productive. Yelena wanted to work on something new and Rio got a chance to start from scratch which helped both of them to understand each other's vibe better.</p><p>But by the time Rio made it home, she was wrecked—emotionally wrung out, body heavy in that bone-deep way that came from too many nights of not sleeping enough, too many thoughts tangled in her head.</p><p>She dropped her keys into the bowl by the door and sank onto the couch, letting her bag slide to the floor with a dull thud.</p><p>Agatha’s shirt still smelled like her and Rio stupidly pressed the edge of the collar to her face and closed her eyes.</p><p>She should take it off. Throw it in the laundry, forget about the morning, the night before. But she didn’t.</p><p>Instead, she let her mind wander—dangerously, stupidly—back to the feel of Agatha's breath against her neck, the heat of her thighs bracketing Rio's hips, the soft whimper that had left her mouth when Rio kissed her.</p><p>The way Agatha had looked at her after had made something in Rio's chest seize. Not just lust. Not just pride.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>And that was the fucking problem.</p><p>Because she remembered what Agatha had said, right before. The words hadn’t been cruel, but they had landed with the same force as a slap.</p><p>
<em> “We can keep this casual. Text each other when we’re in the mood to fuck. No pressure.” </em>
</p><p>It wasn't a question. Not really.</p><p>And in turn, Rio had kissed her instead of answering. Because the look on Agatha’s face when she’d said it—carefully blank, eyes just a little too focused on anything but Rio—had told her everything.</p><p>If Rio had pushed back, if she had said what she really wanted, something that wasn’t casual, something that might last past that night, Agatha would’ve pulled away. Would’ve run.</p><p>So Rio let her believe it. Let her believe she didn’t mind being just another body in Agatha’s bed.</p><p>But that wasn’t true.</p><p>And sure as hell hadn’t been true last night, when Agatha had let go of all the edges. When she made it clear that the only vulnerable part she was letting Rio in was her body.</p><p>Casual, but not meaningless.</p><p>That was Agatha letting Rio hold the weight of her, all of her, in the only way she knew how to be held.</p><p>And Rio didn’t dare fuck that up.</p><p>Didn't dare to ask for more than what Agatha was willing to give her.</p><p>Now, curled up in a too-quiet apartment, Rio pressed the heels of her hands to her eyes.</p><p>
<em> What the fuck was I thinking? </em>
</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>She groaned, dropped her hands, and stared at the ceiling for a second longer before forcing herself to her feet. She didn’t even need to check the peephole.</p><p>Of course it was her.</p><p>“Don’t you have pop star things to do?” she mumbled, pulling the door open wider to let Alice in.</p><p>“I do,” Alice said cheerfully, stepping inside with a pizza box balanced in one hand, “but I wanted to know about your date.” She dumped the box on the coffee table like it was the most casual thing in the world.</p><p>Rio bit back a sigh and turned toward the fridge, opening it more to buy herself time than because she actually wanted a drink.</p><p>She pulled out two beers anyway.</p><p>“Nice shirt,” Alice said, tone bright and unmistakably smug.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio muttered, keeping her back turned as she popped the caps off. No need to encourage her.</p><p>“Oh, come on!” Alice groaned. “Give me something here.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the counter for a beat, the beers sweating in her hands. She could tell her everything—lay it out and wait for Alice to tear it to pieces—or she could lie.</p><p>Neither option felt good.</p><p>“I kinda fucked up,” Rio said, finally walking back over and handing Alice a bottle. “I got stuck at Avengers Studio until late. She was pissed.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes went wide as she sat down, pulling the box open. “Oh my God, you had one job! How did you let that happen?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said, collapsing beside her. “Yelena was pissed, I was trying to help, and I didn’t realize how late it was until I got out.”</p><p>“Typical,” Alice muttered, rolling her eyes. “So how’d you manage to make it up to her? I am assuming the shirt is hers and not from some random girl.”</p><p>“I went to her place with takeout to apologize.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “Nice.” She raised her hand for a high-five, then paused, squinting at Rio. “Wait. Why do you look like a kicked puppy?”</p><p>Rio stared at her bottle. The condensation rolled over her fingers like cold sweat. There was no going around it now.</p><p>“She said it was okay,” she started, voice quiet, “but that she preferred if we kept things casual.”</p><p>Alice winced. “Yikes.” She took a swig of beer. “So what—did you decide to stay and have one last night anyway?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>“Oh my God, you idiot,” Alice groaned. “You agreed with her, didn’t you?”</p><p>Rio gave a small nod.</p><p>“Come on!” Alice dragged a hand down her face. “I thought you said you wanted to date her.”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“So what? You’re gonna keep hooking up with her and hope she magically falls in love with you?” Alice asked, incredulous.</p><p>Rio gave a humorless laugh. “Pretty much, yeah.”</p><p>Alice stared at her. “You’re a fucking idiot.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio said. “But I really think she is just scared”</p><p>“And what are you going to do? Defeat her 7 avoidant attachment style habits?”</p><p>At that Rio had to laugh.</p><p>“I don't know, okay? I will see how this go”</p><p>Alice was quiet for a moment. Then: “Well… I guess if this is the mess you’re signing up for, I’m here for the fallout. But I’m telling you right now, if she breaks your heart, I will egg her apartment.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “That’s fair.”</p><p>“Good,” Alice said, reaching for a slice at last. “Now eat some of this before <em> I </em> start crying over your tragic situationship.”</p><p>They both fell into silence again, the kind that felt more like understanding than avoidance. The pizza cooled on the table between them, mostly untouched. But the space didn’t feel quite as heavy anymore.</p><p>Eventually, Rio glanced sideways. “Hey, Alice?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Alice nudged her with her foot. “Don’t thank me yet. I’m still gonna make fun of your stupid plan in the future”</p><p>“I wouldn't expect anything else from you,” Rio said with a smile.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Agatha was half-lounging on the couch with her laptop on her knees when her phone lit up with the message.</p><p><b>Rio 🍆💦</b> <b><br/>

The "come over" felt heavier than usual, loaded in a way Agatha couldn’t quite read.</p><p>Her mind betrayed her for a second—what if Rio wanted to stop this? What if she had thought it over, sobered up from the warmth of the weekend, and decided this casual thing was too complicated? Or worse, not enough?</p><p>Agatha’s heart thudded. Talk about something. The vague nature of it made her stomach twist. Her instincts wanted to shut the feeling down, to compartmentalize and protect herself—but she also couldn’t help it: the nerves were real.</p><p>Still, she played it cool.</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>

i will think about it.</p><p>But even as she sent the text, she was already mentally sorting through her closet.</p><p>She told herself not to overthink it. She was not going to spiral. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe Rio wanted to renegotiate their “deal.”</p><p>Maybe she—</p><p>She needed to calm down.</p><p>Agatha stood and gave herself the luxury of time. A long shower. She let the water wash away the tension, the confusion, the stupid seed of hope that kept sprouting in the back of her mind like it had any right to be there.</p><p>She moisturized slowly, taking care with every inch of her skin. She spent more time than usual brushing her hair out, running her fingers through the dark strands until it fell in soft waves around her shoulders.</p><p>And when it came time to choose an outfit, she paused—then reached for a sheer black blouse she knew clung just right and tied in soft knots down the front. Easy access. Just in case.</p><p>Because despite everything, she still wanted to be wanted.</p><p>She slipped into a short black skirt, checked herself in the mirror with a practiced glance, and added her locket necklace for good luck and a touch of gloss.</p><p>From the little cabinet next to her bookshelf, she chose a bottle of light white wine. Nothing too heavy. Something they could sip while talking—whatever kind of talking this turned out to be.</p><p>Agatha called the Uber, grabbed her coat, and made her way downstairs. The city buzzed outside, but she didn’t hear it. Not really. She was too busy trying not to wonder what exactly Rio wanted to say.</p><p>The car slowed in front of a red-brick loft with tall windows and creeping ivy clinging to its edges. A garage-turned-studio door sat beside the entrance. There was a bike chained up to the railing, a wind chime barely hanging on to a bent hook, and someone had scribbled a chalk drawing of a cat sunbathing on the concrete. It was charming in a way that made Agatha feel slightly off-balance, like she was stepping into one of Rio’s secrets.</p><p>She checked the address again, then stepped out with the bottle of wine cradled in one arm. As she approached the tall black door, she smoothed her hair out of habit and pressed the doorbell.</p><p>Agatha had barely finished ringing the doorbell when the door to Rio’s loft opened and whatever clever greeting she’d planned died on her tongue.</p><p>Because standing in front of her was Rio. Barefoot. Hair a little messy and wild in that shaggy cut that somehow made her cheekbones sharper and her whole vibe effortlessly cool. Her cropped black tee hugged her shoulders and torso like a second skin, clinging to lean muscle and warm brown skin, revealing a perfect sliver of toned stomach above the waistband of her navy Adidas track pants.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Her brain flatlined for a full three seconds, because… what the hell. She was not supposed to be this turned on already. She thought it would be more like “you left me sore and slightly heartbroken and now I’m standing on your doorstep trying to make <em> you </em> horny” thing.</p><p>But her eyes didn’t get the memo.</p><p>They dragged down from Rio’s jaw—so sharp it could’ve cut glass—down the slope of her neck, to the soft dip at her collarbone, the way her biceps flexed ever so slightly when she leaned one hand against the doorframe. The fabric of her shirt stretched just enough to make Agatha think about things she really shouldn’t be thinking about. And those pants—loose, low-slung, swaying around her hips—somehow managed to make her look even more sculpted.</p><p>Rio didn’t look like she’d tried.</p><p>She looked like she’d rolled out of bed, thrown on whatever was clean, and accidentally reinvented streetwear.</p><p>And Agatha?</p><p>Agatha was malfunctioning.</p><p>She blinked. “Fuck”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. “That's how you're greeting me?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and looked away—desperate for something neutral to focus on, but the hallway behind Rio was filled with sun and exposed brick and smelled like paprika, so that didn’t help either.</p><p>“Shut up” she mumbled, more to herself than anything.</p><p>“Something on your mind, gorgeous?” Rio asked, grinning now, catching on.</p><p>Agatha glared at her. “Nope”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, tongue poking at her cheek in a smug smirk. “Why? Too shy to tell me you're thinking I'm hot?”</p><p>“I think you’re a trap,” Agatha muttered, brushing past her into the loft. “And I’m already regretting coming here.”</p><p>Except she wasn’t. Not even close. And that was exactly the problem.</p><p>Rio's place was annoyingly charming, much like the woman herself. The loft wasn’t huge, but it had high ceilings, exposed brick, and big industrial windows that let the late sun pour in. It smelled faintly of sage and fresh rosemary—probably from the little planter box by the kitchen sink—and the entire space had the kind of warm, low-maintenance style Agatha always said she hated but secretly liked. It was painfully Rio. Cool in a way that didn’t try too hard, just like her.</p><p>She barely made it halfway across the room before Rio’s arms wrapped around her from behind. The contact was firm, warm—familiar in a way that made Agatha’s chest tighten. One of Rio’s hands slipped under her blouse, splaying over her bare stomach, and Agatha inhaled sharply but didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t <em> want </em> to move.</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting you to actually listen to me,” Rio murmured, her voice low against her ear.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>Rio leaned in, her lips brushing against the shell of her ear. “When I said to wear something easy to take off,” she whispered, her fingers skimming Agatha’s waist. “You look so hot, baby”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her body betrayed her—pressing back into Rio’s touch, skin prickling with anticipation.</p><p>“I didn’t wear it for you,” she said, though her voice lacked any bite.</p><p>“Sure,” Rio replied, grinning into her neck. Her fingers didn’t push further, but they stayed there, steady and sure. “Just a coincidence, huh?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to respond but only managed a soft exhale when Rio pressed a kiss beneath her jaw. That was the worst part—how good this felt. How dangerous it was to let it happen. How easy it would be to forget the lines she’d drawn.</p><p>She turned in Rio’s arms and kissed her. Slow at first, then deeper. Like they both needed to taste the restraint they were pretending to have. Rio kissed her like she knew every part of Agatha that shouldn’t be touched—and wanted them anyway. When they pulled apart, Agatha was breathless and maybe a little dizzy.</p><p>But Rio didn’t give her time to think, just grabbed her hand and tugged her toward the kitchen. “Come on, let's eat first,”</p><p>“You cooked?” Agatha asked, only half-mocking.</p><p>“I was already making dinner. You just got lucky,” Rio replied with a smirk. “And I since you brought wine, we can call it even.”</p><p>Agatha set the bottle on the counter and watched Rio move around her own kitchen with effortless confidence. The whole thing felt... too domestic. Like they’d done this before. That made Agatha want to dig her nails into the countertop and remind herself this was supposed to be casual.</p><p>They sat on the couch, wine glasses in hand, and ate. The food was incredible—creamy risotto with roasted vegetables, something Rio had probably made without a recipe. Agatha told her so. Twice.</p><p>But when the plates were empty and her glass half-full, Rio shifted, turning toward her.</p><p>“I thought you wanted to talk,” Agatha said, trying to sound unaffected. But she could already feel her nerves tightening, bracing.</p><p>“I do,” Rio said, calm and steady. “You said you wanted to keep this casual. And I’m good with that. But I realized we haven’t actually set any rules”</p><p>Agatha blinked. She wasn’t expecting that to come from Rio’s mouth. Her stomach dropped, a subtle, unwelcome lurch. This was exactly what she’d asked for. Clear boundaries. No drama. Easy.</p><p>So why did it feel like the ground shifted under her feet?</p><p>She curled her lip and forced a scoff. “Ugh, why do you have to make everything so boring?”</p><p>Rio just rolled her eyes. “Agatha, I get that you want to keep this fun—and I do too. That’s why I don’t want to fuck it up again by accidentally doing something that will piss you off.”</p><p>That was too thoughtful. <em> Too aware. </em> Agatha wanted to scream, or throw a cushion at her, or maybe just run. But instead, she shoved it all down and said—</p><p>“Okay. Fine.”</p><p>Before Rio could say anything else, Agatha moved.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio asked, her tone cautious but amused.</p><p>“Well, as you said, I like to keep things fun,” Agatha replied, already swinging one leg over Rio’s lap and settling herself there with a slow, deliberate roll of her hips. “So I’m going to sit here, and you’re going to try to keep it cool while we finish this very mature and healthy conversation.”</p><p>Rio made a sound that landed somewhere between a groan and a whimper, and Agatha smirked.</p><p>Her hands braced on Rio’s shoulders, dragging lightly over the muscle there, thumbs brushing her collarbones. She tilted her head, eyes half-lidded. “What? You can't multitask?”</p><p>Rio’s hands instinctively found her waist, gripping tightly, but she didn’t pull her closer. She was trying—bless her. Agatha could feel the tension in her shoulders, the tight control behind her gaze.</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Go on. I’m listening.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, eyes dark and unreadable. “You’re the worst.”</p><p>“But you like it.”</p><p>And god help her, Agatha liked it too. Liked being wanted. Liked teasing the control out of someone else instead of fighting to keep her own. Liked that Rio let her play, even when it drove her mad.</p><p>But then she shifted again. Just a little. A slow, deliberate nudge of her hips meant to provoke, to lean into the game.</p><p>Except this time she felt it.</p><p>She blinked. Then blinked again.</p><p>It took a full breath before her brain caught up with her body.</p><p>Something solid. Pressed against her.</p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p>Her breath hitched. She froze.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything—just arched one brow, almost like she’d been <em> waiting </em> for this moment.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened on her shoulders, nails digging in lightly, and the heat that shot through her core was immediate, devastating. Her confidence teetered.</p><p>“You’re…” she started, then stopped, then made a small, involuntary noise in the back of her throat. “Seriously?”</p><p>Rio smiled—lazy, cocky, unfairly in control. “What happened, gorgeous? Not so confident anymore?”</p><p>Agatha could only look at her, thrown wildly off-balance. Her plan to tease, to keep things light, had just spectacularly backfired. She tried to recover, sitting back slightly—though she didn’t move off Rio’s lap. Her lips parted. Her cheeks flushed.</p><p>“I fucking hate you,” she muttered.</p><p>“Sure you do,” Rio murmured, letting her hands slide lower, settling at the small of Agatha’s back. “Is that why you're grinding on my lap right now?”</p><p>“I am not—” Agatha began, then realized she was. Her hips had moved unconsciously, slowly, like her body was betraying her one nerve ending at a time.</p><p>When Rio pulled her closer again, she couldn’t stop the soft, wanting moan that escaped her throat. She barely caught it in her hand as she clapped it over her mouth.</p><p>Rio laughed, warm and low. “You need to focus.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Fine. First rule: no cuddling.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Seriously?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha said, voice a little higher than usual. “This is about sex. Not feelings.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know,” Rio said.</p><p>“I’m just trying to avoid… confusion,” Agatha pointed.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, pretending to think. “Okay, but… what if we accidentally cuddle in our sleep?”</p><p>“That doesn’t count,” Agatha said too fast.</p><p>Rio bit her lip, clearly holding back a laugh. “Right. Accidental cuddling—totally fine. Got it.”</p><p>Agatha scowled. “Stop mocking me.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, brushing her nose against Agatha’s cheek. “You’re very cute when you’re flustered.”</p><p>“<em> Focus, </em>” Agatha growled.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Rio said, holding up her hands in mock surrender, but quickly putting back on Agatha’s waist. “No cuddling. Got it.”</p><p>She paused, then added, “No kisses outside the bedroom.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look. A long, loaded, are-you-kidding-me stare. “You literally kissed me when I got here.”</p><p>“I meant outside the sex thing,” Rio corrected quickly. “you know, with the intent of having sex”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Fine. No going out together.”</p><p>Rio blinked again. “Wait, so we can only see each other at our places?”</p><p>“I mean, if I run into you somewhere, I’m not going to, like, turn around and run away.”</p><p>“Wow,” Rio said, full of dry sarcasm. “How considerate of you.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a tight smile. “You’re welcome.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, then leaned forward again, resting her forehead against Agatha’s. “You’re such a mess.”</p><p>“You’re one to talk.”</p><p>“No, but seriously, what if I want to invite you to my studio?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha arched her brow. “Is there a particular reason you would do that?”</p><p>“I don't know, I might get horny there” Rio bit back making Agatha laugh so hard she almost fell from her lap.</p><p>“You're ridiculous, I mean like nothing that feels like a date, you know, restaurants, movies, those things”</p><p>“Got it, can't buy you food” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha pinched Rio’s side without warning, making her yelp and squirm under her.</p><p>“Don’t do that,” Rio whined, trying to wiggle away.</p><p>The movement, however, had the opposite effect—Agatha was jostled forward, her hips sliding and grinding against Rio’s lap in a way that was absolutely not accidental. A strangled moan escaped her throat before she could catch it, and her eyes fluttered shut for a second.</p><p>“Fuck, don’t do that,” she hissed, but the words lacked heat, especially since she was still moving, grinding slowly like her body hadn’t caught up to the protest in her brain.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem to mind. She leaned in, voice low and smug against Agatha’s ear. “The sooner we’re done with this, the sooner you’re going to be able to enjoy this properly.”</p><p>A full-body shiver ran down Agatha’s spine. She groaned, tossing her head back for a second before glaring at her. “Fine, let’s keep going.”</p><p>Rio grinned like she’d won something. “Okay, so… I can’t invite you to Alice’s next concert?”</p><p>Agatha perked up immediately. “Wait—Alice is having another concert?”</p><p>Rio laughed, nodding. “Yeah. So, okay—rule revision. No going out… unless Alice has a concert.”</p><p>“I didn’t say that,” Agatha said, though her excitement had already betrayed her. “But you can give me tickets.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes in mock seriousness. “And you’ll… what? Not pretend you didn’t see me?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, then leaned forward and bit her shoulder gently.</p><p>“Ow—okay, okay, I got it!” Rio laughed, pulling her closer again.</p><p>“Good. No meeting friends,” Agatha added, trying to refocus.</p><p>Rio’s expression changed—just a flicker, but enough. “Fine. No family either.”</p><p>Agatha immediately looked away. She didn’t like talking about her family, even on a good day. Especially not when she was trying very, very hard not to make this whole thing any more complicated than it already was.</p><p>There was a short beat.</p><p>Rio, ever attuned, asked quietly, “Are you okay, baby?”</p><p>Agatha’s body tensed. “No pet names outside the bed,” she snapped—not too loud, but fast enough to make it hurt.</p><p>And it did. She saw the way Rio’s face dropped, just a little. Like she’d been caught mid-reach and told off for trying.</p><p>“Okay. Sorry,” Rio said, her voice soft now, almost cautious.</p><p>Agatha felt it hit—like a small, mean echo under her ribs. She hadn’t meant it to come out like that. She hadn’t meant to make Rio look like that. But she didn’t backtrack.</p><p>Instead, she shifted again, curling one hand behind Rio’s neck like she wanted to press reset.</p><p>“And no sappy talk,” she added quickly, trying to sound teasing.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Dead serious,” Agatha said, even though her voice felt a little thinner now.</p><p>Rio looked at her for a long beat, unreadable.</p><p>“Fine,” she said at last. “No sappy talk.”</p><p>Agatha smiled tightly. “Perfect.”</p><p>But the twist in her stomach didn’t go away.</p><p>“Anything else?” she forced herself to ask, her voice more brittle than she intended.</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, brushing her fingers down Agatha’s arm, like she was grounding herself before stepping into something delicate.</p><p>“I know this is a non-exclusive thing,” she said, soft but clear, “but I don’t really want to know if you hook up with someone else. And I’ll keep it to myself too.”</p><p>Agatha tried not to think about how those words lodged somewhere deep in her chest, sharp and lingering. The thought of Rio with someone else clawed at her brain, but she forced herself to smile like it didn’t matter.</p><p>“Sure,” she said simply. “That’s fair.”</p><p>They both sat still for a beat. Not saying anything. Not looking at each other quite the same. The room felt quieter than it had all night. A heavy kind of quiet. Not tense, just… dense.</p><p>Then Rio moved.</p><p>She shifted her hands to Agatha’s hips, grounding them there before leaning up—close, deliberate, careful. She pressed a kiss to Agatha’s collarbone, then another to her neck, and finally, her mouth met Agatha’s in a kiss that was slower than before.</p><p>It wasn’t rushed like the earlier teasing. It was warm. Deep. A little hungry.</p><p>Agatha melted into it despite herself.</p><p>And just like that, something settled between them. Not clarity exactly, but a truce made with mouths and hands instead of logic.</p><p>There was something steady in the way Rio kissed her now, something that said <em> I heard you. I’m still here. </em></p><p>It made Agatha want to scream.</p><p>Instead, she reached up and tangled her fingers in Rio’s hair, kissing her back hard, like she could override whatever Rio had just made her feel.</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, Agatha swallowed thickly.</p><p>“So that’s it? All the rules?” she asked, her voice rough with want.</p><p>Rio nodded, lips brushing against hers. “Unless you have more.”</p><p>Agatha gave a tight smirk. “No. I think we’ve done enough negotiating for one night.”</p><p>She moves forward, biting at the junction of Rio’s neck and shoulders, kissing it softly before biting at it.</p><p>“Fuck” Rio said squirming under her. “Okay, one more rule, no visible marks, I don't want to go out looking like a teenager who had just learned what a hickey is”</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“Fine, only private marking. Got it” she said, purposefully giving Rio a thumbs up.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but she was smiling now.</p><p>“Then we’re good?” Agatha asked, her hands already playing with the hem of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath. “We’re good.”</p><p>And maybe that was true. Maybe it wasn’t.</p><p>Either way, she was already leaning in for another kiss.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Agatha’s skin was warm under her hands, and Rio hummed contently as she trailed kisses down her collarbone, lingering at the hollow where she could feel Agatha’s pulse fluttering.</p><p>But even as Agatha arched into her—deliberate, greedy, with fingers tugging up the hem of Rio’s shirt like it offended her—Rio could still feel it.</p><p>The shift.</p><p>Not a retreat, not obvious.</p><p>But a wall. Quietly raised. Precision where there should’ve been abandon.</p><p>Anyone else would’ve missed it. But Rio has been watching Agatha close enough to let it go unnoticed.</p><p>She knew suggesting this to Agatha would make her think about this situation and it could backfire. Because thinking clearly made Agatha look for the exits.</p><p>But Rio needed this leverage. Not to win the night, but to map the lines. To learn where Agatha let herself be touched when it crawled under her skin.</p><p>Still, this was better than she expected.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t run. She hadn’t shut down. But she paused. She’d kissed like it was a strategy. Every motion was carefully loaded, like she was trying to keep her own softness from showing.</p><p>And that stung. Just a little. Not because Rio didn’t get it—but because she did.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how to be cared for in the quiet. That wasn’t where she felt safe.</p><p>She didn’t let people in when things were still. No, she only let them in when everything was on fire.</p><p>So fine, Rio would let it burn.</p><p>Her mouth curved slightly against her skin as she let her hands slide lower—slow, sure, reverent.</p><p>If Agatha needed noise to drown out the doubt, she’d give her thunder. If she needed to be wrecked to feel real, then Rio would worship her that way, with teeth, with pressure, with motion that said <em> I see you, </em>even if the words never passed between them.</p><p>But she’d get Rio, too. Every inch of her. Every flicker of want curled into the smirk, every pulse of adoration woven through the teasing. She’d get someone who already knew her tells, who was already starting to anticipate the next move. Someone who’d work to earn every sound, every quake, every surrender.</p><p>Agatha had said from day one, she liked to make people work for it.</p><p>So she would.</p><p>Rio felt her grinding against her lap now, deliberate and rhythmic, not in desperation, but in control. A dare.</p><p>As if saying <em> “Come on, don't you want this?” </em></p><p>Rio did. Without missing a beat, her hands moved to the lace at Agatha’s blouse, tugging with careful fingers until the knot unraveled and the fabric fell open. She pulled back just far enough to see.</p><p>No bra. Of course.</p><p>Just Agatha—flushed, half-naked, breasts rising with every breath, nipples already peaked with attention.</p><p>The sight alone made Rio bite her lip. Her fingers tightened instinctively on Agatha’s ribs.</p><p>"Fuck," she breathed, more to herself than anything else.</p><p>She leaned in and mouthed at her breast, soft at first, then firmer, letting her tongue flick, swirl, teeth graze just enough to make Agatha gasp and arch closer.</p><p>The sounds she made—needy but challenging—fueled Rio’s determination. Her hands slid lower, tracing her thighs, pushing up Agatha’s absurdly short skirt, watching it bunch around her waist.</p><p>Rio pulled back again, just to look.</p><p>Smirking at the way the fabric between her legs was damp, clinging. A deep, dark patch blooming through the lace.</p><p>“Already this worked up, baby?” Rio murmured, voice low and cocky.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a shaky breath—half scoff, half moan.</p><p>“You do like to hear yourself talk, huh?” she said, hips canting up, clearly inviting the next move.</p><p>Rio grinned. “Only when it gets you like this.”</p><p>She ran two fingers along the wet patch, slow and firm, dragging out another sharp breath from Agatha.</p><p>She leaned in, all heat and intention, and kissed her with the kind of hunger that was both promise and proof.</p><p>She’d take Agatha apart.</p><p>Not because she wanted to win. But because she wanted her to feel it. Wanted her to remember that being touched like this, being known like this, wasn’t a weakness.</p><p>It was safety.</p><p>It was intimacy.</p><p>And it could start here, in the fire.</p><p>Agatha pulled her shirt off with the kind of frantic urgency that made Rio’s pulse spike. But Rio didn’t move to strip further.</p><p>She just leaned back on the couch, arms spread wide like a throne, watching the way Agatha’s chest heaved with every shallow breath. She was flushed, pupils blown wide, skin gleaming in the low light.</p><p>Her knees digging into the cushions, Agatha rolled her hips again—chasing friction.</p><p>The strap pressed hard between them and Agatha was making a mess on it. On her. Rio didn’t stop her. But she didn’t give in either.</p><p>Rio tried not to let it go when Agatha moved her fingers with precision over her sternum, cupping her breast with intent.</p><p>Instead, she let her hands roam up Agatha’s thighs, slow and possessive, thumbs brushing over sensitive skin. Until she was met with the damp spot on her panties again and she pressed just firm enough to make Agatha gasp.</p><p>"You're soaked," Rio murmured, smiling like she’d won a bet they both knew she’d placed the second Agatha climbed into her lap. “You’re going to ruin my pants, baby.”</p><p>Agatha rocked forward harder in response, pinching at one of Rio’s nipples while her mouth closed greedily around the other, but Rio stilled her with a hand on her hip.</p><p>“Slow down.”</p><p>Agatha whined—an honest, needy sound that Rio felt all the way down her spine.</p><p>“I said,” she whispered, guiding her hips into a slower grind, “slow.”</p><p>“You’re so fucking mean,” Agatha hissed, but her fingers clutched at Rio’s ribs like she didn’t want to be anywhere else.</p><p>“You love it,” Rio teased. “when I make you take your time.”</p><p>She leaned in and licked a stripe up Agatha’s throat, lips brushing the edge of her jaw. Agatha shuddered.</p><p>Then Rio dipped her hand under Agatha’s panties. No rush. Just warmth and slow, confident touch. slicking her fingers through everything Agatha had made for her, before she finally helped her out of the soaked fabric and dragged her thumb over her clit just soft enough to tease.</p><p>Agatha whimpered.</p><p>“See,” Rio murmured. “You’re already falling apart. And I barely touched you”</p><p>But palms didn't lose pressure, though. She let her eyes flicker to Agath’s face, memorizing the wall she trembled.</p><p>Agatha let out a low, shaky groan, dropping her forehead to Rio’s. “Please.”</p><p>“Please what?” Rio asked, voice thick, her fingers still slow and cruel between Agatha’s legs. “You want it me to fuck you?”</p><p>Agatha moaned, a helpless little sound that had Rio tightening her hold on her hips.</p><p>“I can feel you’re already close,” Rio said, dragging her hand lower again, just enough pressure to keep Agatha on edge. “But you’re not going to come yet.”</p><p>She kissed her, deep and deliberate, like a claim. Her free hand going up, fingers circling a nipple, making her gasp again.</p><p>“I’m gonna take my time,” Rio whispered against her lips. “And you're gonna feel every second of it.”</p><p>Agatha was trembling now, thighs shaking around her, hips twitching forward like her body couldn’t help it.</p><p>Rio moved her hand again, this time with more pressure, fingers slick and sure, working Agatha closer and closer, but never tipping her over.</p><p>She could feel it, the tension, the ache, how badly Agatha wanted to let go.</p><p>But Rio made her wait.</p><p>Not to be cruel.</p><p>But because she wanted this to be the kind of pleasure that came slow, thick, inevitable.</p><p>The kind that said: <em> I know you. I know how to make you come undone. Let me. </em></p><p>Agatha was panting now, nails digging into Rio’s back, forehead pressed to hers as her body shook.</p><p>“Please,” she begged again, voice cracking. “Rio—”</p><p>Rio heard the way Agatha said her name—like it was all she had left. Like it was the only thing she still remembered how to say.</p><p>She looked up through half-lidded eyes, watching Agatha’s face twist with the effort of holding on. The way her thighs trembled around Rio’s hips. The way her mouth opened but no sound came out, just little choked gasps as Rio kept her hand working slow, tight circles against her clit.</p><p>“You’re so fucking pretty like this,” Rio whispered, breath ghosting against Agatha’s flushed chest, mouth brushing her sternum. “Falling apart for me.”</p><p>She curled her fingers just a little deeper, still shallow, still not quite giving her everything. Still keeping her there on the edge.</p><p>Agatha made a sound like she was going to cry. She rocked forward, hips chasing friction, smearing herself further against the bulge beneath her, staining Rio’s pants with every desperate roll. Her arms were trembling now, barely holding her upright.</p><p>“Fuck, baby,” she murmured, smirking as Agatha moved. “You’re making a mess on me.”</p><p>And she was. The dark fabric of Rio’s pants was damp beneath Agatha, clinging slightly where her slick heat pressed through. Agatha didn’t stop. If anything, the wet sound of it, the slight resistance in the fabric, only made her grind harder.</p><p>Rio’s hand traced a slow path up the back of her thigh, deliberate and steady, just enough to make Agatha shiver.</p><p>“I haven’t even gotten my pants off yet,” Rio drawled, gaze dragging across Agatha’s flushed face, the way her hair was slipping out of its pins. “Haven’t fucked you with my cock yet and you’re already dripping all over me.”</p><p>Agatha whined—quiet, desperate—and lifted her hips, just enough to unseat herself.</p><p>“Then take it off,” she rasped, tugging at the waistband of Rio’s pants like she was ready to tear them herself.</p><p>Rio chuckled, one brow arched. “You gonna behave if I do?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha snapped, impatient. “I’m gonna fuck myself on your cock until I forget my own name.”</p><p>That did something to Rio. Her mouth parted slightly, her smirk softening into something far hungrier. She lifted her hips just enough to peel down the pants and boxers together, revealing the black harness snug against her hips and the purple silicone cock standing proud, ready.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped, pupils blown wide. She moved forward like it was magnetic, but Rio caught her waist in one firm hand.</p><p>“Ah-ah,” she teased. “I’m taking my time, remember?”</p><p>She angled her hips just so, letting the tip of the strap brush through Agatha's folds. Agatha whined above her.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about fucking you with it since that first day”</p><p>Agatha moaned, nearly folding forward. “Rio—”</p><p>“Mm-mm.” Rio’s voice was pure sin now. “And that fucking teasing thing you pulled didn't help either”</p><p>Agatha whined, trying to push down.</p><p>“You’re gonna sit down slow, baby. I want you to feel every inch.” Rio finally said.</p><p>Agatha nodded desperately, rising just enough to line herself up. Rio helped guide her, one hand on her hip, the other steadying the base. And when Agatha finally sank down, slow and shaky, her breath punched out of her like a prayer.</p><p>“Shit—” she gasped, clinging to Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio whispered, tightening her grip. “You like it?”</p><p>Instead of answering, Agatha rolled her hips once, experimentally, and Rio groaned—more from the sight than the feel. Her hands flexed on Agatha’s waist as she pulled her in, grounding them both.</p><p>“You feel so fucking good like this,” Rio said, voice low in her throat, lips brushing against Agatha’s cheek, her jaw, her ear. “You make me wanna ruin you.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered, nails digging into Rio’s shoulders as she rocked harder. But Rio kept her pace slow. Guiding. Measured.</p><p>“You’re not gonna rush this,” she murmured, nipping at Agatha’s throat. “You’re gonna fall apart nice and slow for me. I want you to remember how it feels when I take my time with you.”</p><p>She brought her hand back to Agatha's clit, drawing out the tight, shuddering moan it pulled from deep in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Rio slid her free hand up her back, warm and steady, grounding her. “That’s right” she murmured, voice lower, gentler. “You’re doing so good, baby,”</p><p>Agatha groaned—something between exasperation and desperation—and slumped forward, cheek pressing to Rio’s. Her breath was hot and uneven.</p><p>Then, finally, she mumbled it.</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha said, barely audible. “Please.”</p><p>It hit Rio like a jolt—low and rough and pleading. Not just lust. Not just want. Need. That single word cracked something open. Unlocked her restraint.</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio said, voice hoarse now. “You wanna come?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, frantic and helpless, and Rio didn’t tease anymore.</p><p>She planted her feet on the ground, matching Agatha’s pace, working her clit with her palm, holding her firmly with the other arm as Agatha’s body locked up around her.</p><p>“Come for me, baby,” Rio whispered against her temple. “Let go. I’ve got you.”</p><p>And Agatha did.</p><p>It crashed over her all at once, sharp and hot and messy. Her whole body tensed, then bucked, legs trembling as she gasped out a sob, then a cry, then just Rio’s name again, over and over. Her hands clutched at Rio’s back, digging in like she needed to anchor herself, like she might float off if she didn’t.</p><p>Rio held her through it, easing her thrusts but never stopping. Not until she felt Agatha collapse against her chest, boneless and shaking, lips parted in stunned silence.</p><p>She kissed the top of her head, one hand still tracing slow circles across her back.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio whispered, barely able to speak around the rush of emotion in her throat.</p><p>Agatha let out a weak laugh, still catching her breath, and slumped fully into her arms.</p><p>“Fucking hell,” she mumbled, voice wrecked. “You’re evil.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, arms tightening around her. “But I made you feel good.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even pretend to argue. She just nodded, and whispered, “Yeah. You really did.”</p><p>Then she leaned in again, mouth hot and open and hungry and Rio let her, because she wasn’t just trying to make Agatha feel good.</p><p>She was trying to make Agatha let her into the quiet, too. She was trying to teach her what it meant to be loved.</p><p>Even if all Agatha could handle tonight was the lesson burned in her body.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p>

<p>It’s been almost two months since they decided to do the friends with benefits thing—and, against all odds, it was going surprisingly smooth. No drama. No expectations. Just heat, pleasure, and the kind of intimacy that neither of them dared to examine too closely.</p><p>They still texted during the day. Quick check-ins. Memes. Snarky comments about annoying coworkers. Agatha sent blurry screenshots of confusing datasets that were driving her insane. Rio replied with short videos of half-finished tracks and long, breathy voice notes when her brain was fried. </p><p>Only now, the emojis were filthier, the jokes sharper, and the tension always humming under the surface. Agatha would be in a meeting and get a <em> “thinking about how good you sound when you come” </em> message that made her shift in her seat. Rio would get a photo of Agatha’s legs stretched out on her couch with a casual <em> “bored. need something to do. or someone.” </em></p><p>At first, it was weekends only. Booty calls that began with a text and ended with one of them limping the next day. But it drifted. Slid into the week. Into late-night visits and post-work quickies, into whispered confessions that started with<em> “I haven’t stopped thinking about your mouth” </em>and ended with one of them getting wrecked over Rio’s kitchen table.</p><p>It wasn’t just convenience anymore. Not just sex. There was tension now, and comfort. Craving and curiosity. Familiar hands that knew just how to touch, how to tease. Familiar lips that always returned to the same places like muscle memory.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t about to complain. She was having the time of her life. </p><p>So when her phone buzzed late that night with a text from her favorite distraction, she was already smiling.</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🍆💦<br/>
<img alt="" height="400" src="https://i.ibb.co/k2RMRPQB/IMG-5645.jpg" width="300"/><br/>
done for today 💪🏼</p><p>Agatha groaned, swiping a hand over her face. God, how was she supposed not to be horny when Rio kept doing shit like that?</p><p align="right"><b>me</b><br/>

🏃🏻‍♀️‍➡️</p><p>Agatha laughed, heart pounding. She didn’t bother trying to focus on her screen again. There was no point. Not with the way her body was already warming up with anticipation. She shut her laptop, tossed it on the coffee table, and padded barefoot to her bedroom to fix her hair, freshen up, and throw on something very easy to remove. </p><p>When the knock finally came, she nearly tripped on her own excitement rushing to open the door.</p><p>Rio stood there, a takeout bag in one hand and that same post-workout glow still lingering on her cheeks. She didn’t even get a word out.</p><p>Agatha grabbed her by the collar of her t-shirt and yanked her inside with a hungry kiss that left no room for doubt.</p><p>Rio barely managed to drop the food on the side table before Agatha pressed her back against the door, her fingers already tugging at the hem of her sweatpants, her mouth moving like she'd been starving.</p><p>With a groan, Rio moved her hands to the back of Agatha's thighs, holding her up. Agatha let out a sound between a surprised gasp and a moan, her hands gripping Rio’s shoulders for balance, but she wrapped her legs tightly around her waist like it was second nature.</p><p>Rio walked them through the apartment with ease, navigating the short hallway while kissing her slow and deep, her grip steady even as Agatha shifted in her arms, grinding against her with no shame.</p><p>“Fuck, those workouts are really paying off, huh?” Agatha whispered against her lips, breathless and already wrecked from just the taste.</p><p>Rio smirked, cocky and flushed. “Oh, baby, I’m barely using my muscles”</p><p>Agatha barked out a laugh, low and sharp, biting at Rio’s bottom lip before kissing her again, deeper now, hungrier.</p><p>“Well then,” she murmured between kisses, “remind me to thank your trainer later.”</p><p>Rio reached the bedroom and didn’t even bother turning the lights on. The soft glow from the hallway was enough. She dropped Agatha gently onto the bed, following immediately after, slotting their bodies together like they were made for it.</p><p>“You can thank me first,” Rio said, her voice low and teasing, as she leaned down to press her mouth to Agatha’s jaw, then her neck, nipping just below her ear in a way that made Agatha shiver.</p><p>“Cocky,” Agatha breathed, fingers sliding under the waistband of Rio’s sweats. “You’re so cocky, baby”</p><p>“You love it,” Rio said, and there wasn’t even a trace of doubt.</p><p>Agatha didn’t deny it.</p><p>Instead, she pulled her closer, her body arching up to meet her, lips dragging over Rio’s throat as she whispered, “Shut up and make me come before the food gets cold.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Baby, you’ll be too limp to even chew when I’m done.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply this time. She just grabbed Rio by the back of the neck and dragged her down into a kiss—fast, hot, all teeth and tongue and desperation. There was no teasing left in her body, no smirking remark waiting on her lips. She didn’t want to be coy. She didn’t want to be clever. She just wanted to feel her.</p><p>Rio kissed her back just as fiercely. There was no hesitation—there never had been, not with them. From the beginning, they both knew exactly how to touch each other, how to make each other burn. And right now, Agatha was on fire.</p><p>She pulled at Rio’s shirt impatiently, shoving it up her ribs and tossed it to the side without ceremony. Her fingers grazed bare skin and her whole body shivered, wanting more. Needing it. She pushed herself up just enough to lick across Rio’s collarbone, to bite her shoulder, to dig her nails into the warm skin of her back as Rio settled fully between her legs.</p><p>Feeling Rio’s weight over her felt like coming home.</p><p>Rio's mouth was everywhere—her throat, her jaw, her chest. Kissing, licking, biting. Agatha arched up into her, nails scraping down her spine, her breath coming in harsh, uneven bursts.</p><p>“Fuck,” she whimpered, hips tilting. “I need you—I need—”</p><p>“I know,” Rio murmured into her skin. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha could feel how soaked she already was, could feel how slick her thighs were, how badly her body ached for more. Rio’s hand slipped between them and Agatha nearly sobbed when fingers found her, slow and sure and devastating. Her hips jerked up, shameless.</p><p>She wanted more. She wanted everything.</p><p>Her hands clung to Rio’s back, then tangled in her hair, pulling her down for another kiss—messy and breathless and demanding. Her legs wrapped around Rio’s waist without thought, trying to keep her close, to ground herself in the feel of her body against hers.</p><p>“Don’t stop,” Agatha begged, voice wrecked. “Please don’t stop—”</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio breathed, nipping at her ear, her fingers never faltering. “I told you. I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha felt like she was breaking apart and clawing her way toward heaven at the same time. Every touch from Rio was exact—like she knew the way Agatha’s body responded, how close she was, how much she wanted to fall apart in her hands.</p><p>And Agatha did want to fall apart. But she wanted to give it too. To offer every gasp, every moan, every frantic arch of her hips like a gift.</p><p>Her hand slipped between them, wanting to touch her too, to make her feel even half of what Agatha was feeling. But Rio caught her wrist and pinned it above her head, eyes dark and locked on hers.</p><p>“Not yet,” she said. “This is for you.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered, her body trembling under the weight of that certainty. “I want to make you feel good—”</p><p>“You will,” Rio said. “But right now I want to hear you falling apart”</p><p>And Agatha shattered.</p><p>Her whole body bucked up as the orgasm tore through her, fast and brutal. She cried out, eyes squeezing shut, fingernails digging into Rio’s shoulder where she’d been released. Her thighs clamped tight around her, and she held on like she might float away otherwise.</p><p>Rio kissed her through it—soft, grounding, her voice murmuring low reassurances she could barely understand but clung to anyway.</p><p>Agatha’s chest was heaving. Her skin felt feverish when she flipped them, somehow, with shaky limbs and sheer will. She hooked her fingers into the waistband of Rio’s pants and tugged them down. Her kisses followed, slow and reverent at first, a trail of devotion from navel to hip, her mouth worshipping warm skin, her mind quiet for just a beat.</p><p>Then she saw them.</p><p>Two faint bruises. One just above Rio’s inner thigh, the other lower, darker, like the echo of fingers gripping too tight. They were half-faded at the edges—greenish-yellow—and sore-looking in the center.</p><p>Not fresh. Not old enough to be from last time.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted.</p><p>Her lips froze inches above Rio’s skin, hovering like her thoughts. Her eyes locked on the bruises, her pulse thudding so loud in her ears she barely registered the moan Rio let out above her.</p><p>They weren’t <em> hers. </em></p><p>She would’ve remembered.</p><p>She tried to push it away. Tried to rationalize. They weren’t exclusive. This wasn’t supposed to be that. Rio could do whatever she wanted, <em> whoever </em> she wanted.</p><p>But her hands clenched.</p><p>Her chest burned.</p><p>She imagined someone else’s hands on Rio’s thighs, leaving these exact shadows behind. Someone else coaxing those breathless sounds from her lips. Her jaw tightened so hard it ached.</p><p>“Everything okay, baby?” Rio asked, pulling herself up by the elbow. Her voice gentle and curious, breath still uneven.</p><p>Agatha blinked, startled by how long she’d been staring.</p><p>She swallowed the knot in her throat, forced her mouth into a smile, and tilted her head up. “Just taking my time,” she said, her voice velvet-smooth but tight at the edges.</p><p>She didn’t give herself time to dwell.</p><p>She dipped her head back down and kissed the skin right next to one of the bruises—slow, but with something darker simmering beneath it. Her tongue slid over the spot. She kissed it again, then opened her mouth wider.</p><p>And bit. Not enough to hurt, but enough to leave a mark.</p><p>Rio gasped. Her hips jerked, caught off guard. Agatha didn’t apologize. Didn’t pause.</p><p>She trailed her mouth up Rio’s body, tongue sliding hot and rough along her stomach, then higher—lips brushing her ribs, her sternum.</p><p>Kissing. Biting. Marking.</p><p>She sucked a bruise into the curve of her breast, just above where her bra would sit. Another over her collarbone. Another high on her shoulder—each one deliberate, placed in spots she knew would peek out from tank tops, shirts, towels.</p><p>Agatha could still hear Rio’s voice telling her they shouldn’t leave marks. But she ignored it now.</p><p>Her tongue slid across Rio’s chest. She kissed hard, scraped her teeth down until Rio whimpered, her hands gripping the sheets, her back arching with every pass of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“Shit,” Rio exhaled, voice breathless. “That’s—Baby—fuck.”</p><p>Agatha still said nothing.</p><p>She braced one hand over Rio’s stomach to keep her still, her other skimming up to cup her breast, thumb teasing, squeezing, as her mouth continued its campaign across her skin.</p><p>She kissed the edge of her neck, then behind her ear, then lower again—just beneath the jawline.</p><p>And then she sucked, slow and deep.</p><p>A bloom of red flushed up immediately, and Agatha didn’t stop until she knew it would last. Until it was undeniable. Until it was hers.</p><p>Rio’s moan sounded almost dazed. “You’re—Jesus, you’re really—”</p><p>Agatha slid back down before she could finish.</p><p>She was done being careful.</p><p>Her mouth moved back to Rio’s inner thighs, but this time, she didn’t hesitate. She kissed around the old bruises, then to the opposite thigh—biting again, her nails sinking lightly into Rio’s hips.</p><p>She wasn’t asking. She wasn’t gentling it.</p><p>She was claiming—not through words, but through the way Rio gasped and squirmed, through the flush on her skin, through the scratches blooming where Agatha’s fingers gripped too tightly.</p><p>Her hands roamed, pinning, guiding, holding Rio open like something precious. </p><p>Her kisses turned rougher, wetter, her tongue moving deliberately, teasing and devouring until Rio was shaking under her.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio gasped, her hand in Agatha’s hair now, clutching tight. “I’m gonna—”</p><p>Agatha didn’t let up. She doubled down, one hand splayed across Rio’s stomach to anchor her, the other sliding lower to steady her thigh, thumb brushing over fresh marks she’d made.</p><p>There was a wildness in her now. Something unspoken but undeniable. Something that burned down through every touch, every lick, every scrape of teeth.</p><p>By the time Rio came, gasping her name and writhing beneath her, Agatha’s chest was heaving again—less from effort, and more from everything she wasn’t saying.</p><p>She kissed the inside of Rio’s thigh again as the tremors faded, then rested her head there for a moment, lips parted, heart pounding.</p><p>She didn’t look at the old bruises again. She didn’t need to. She’d left new ones.</p><p>Ones no one would mistake.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Somehow, having sex with Agatha had left her more sore than the almost 2 hours of workout session she pushed herself through it earlier.</p><p>Rio groaned as she finished tugging on her sweatpants. Her body ached in all the right ways, the kind of exhaustion that came from being thoroughly worked over and wanting it all over again. Her skin still held the memory of Agatha’s mouth—bruises she was going to have to pretend didn't exist if anyone noticed them tomorrow. </p><p>She should be pissed, she had specifically told Agatha not to do this, but in all honesty she didn't really care.</p><p>She padded barefoot toward the kitchen, following the smell of warm spices and something tangy and familiar. Agatha had left her behind after their shower, mumbling something about being starving, and now stood at the stove in one of Rio’s shirts—oversized, washed-out black cotton that hung down over her thighs as she stole a cube of feta from the open container of Greek salad.</p><p>Rio paused in the doorway for a second, just watching her. Agatha’s hair was damp and tucked behind one ear, her skin pink from the heat of the shower. She looked… soft, relaxed. <em> Real. </em></p><p>It hit Rio in a small, quiet way. The kind of moment she didn’t let herself linger in too long.</p><p>Instead, she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around Agatha from behind, pressing a kiss to her temple.</p><p>“I asked them to put extra feta for you and you're still stealing from mine?” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha hummed in satisfaction, leaning back into her like it was the most natural thing in the world. “It tastes better this way”</p><p>Rio smiled into her hair. She hadn’t actually planned to stop at the Armenian place after her class—she usually just went straight home and made whatever was fast—but Agatha had texted her to come over, so she just got them something to eat, knowing pretty well Agatha would be starving and complaining the whole time if there was nothing ready for her to eat after.</p><p>Normally, Rio's go-to side dish at this restaurant was the tabouleh salad. But last week, Agatha had wrinkled her nose at it, picking around the parsley until Rio finally asked, “You don’t like it, huh?” and Agatha had replied, “Listen, I swear I tried, but it tastes like soap to me”</p><p>So now there were two portions of Greek salad in the bag, even though Rio didn’t even really like feta all that much. But she liked the way Agatha’s eyes lit up when she stole it from her plate. That had seemed like reason enough.</p><p>Agatha moved toward the living room, balancing the plates of shish kabob in her hands. Rio grabbed two glasses and the bottle of iced tea, just about to follow when she heard Agatha curse and call out over her shoulder, “Can you pick another fork for me? I just dropped mine.”</p><p>Rio did, handing it to her once she joined her on the couch, close enough that their knees touched.</p><p>“Thanks, baby,” Agatha said absently, eyes on the TV as she flipped through options.</p><p>And Rio froze.</p><p>
<em> Baby. </em>
</p><p>Not in bed. Not panting against her skin. Not whispered like a secret she wasn’t supposed to hear. Just… casually dropped in the middle of reheated food and unsweetened iced tea.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, just blinked once—twice—and studied Agatha’s face as if that might offer a clue. But Agatha just grabbed her plate and started to eat like nothing had happened.</p><p>Two months into this arrangement and Agatha hadn’t called her anything but Rio outside the bedroom since the whole rules talk. It had been a clean line drawn in the sand—something Agatha needed, something Rio had learned not to push.</p><p>So yeah. Hearing it now—soft, almost absent—made Rio’s stomach do something stupid.</p><p>So she didn’t do anything. Just stuffed a forkful of Greek salad into her mouth and tried not to smile like a complete idiot.</p><p>Agatha sat beside her, one knee tucked up, half-focused on some old episode of Abbott Elementary, stealing every piece of feta from Rio’s plate like it belonged to her.</p><p>Agatha turned to her, but when she looked at Rio she narrowed her eyes. “You good?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “Yeah,” she lied. “Just remembered something Yelena told me yesterday.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, biting into a piece of chicken. “How’s her thing with Kate, by the way?”</p><p>That saved her. Rio jumped at the distraction. “A disaster, probably. Every time she comes by the studio, they act like teenagers with a crush, and I have to watch it unfold like it’s a slow-motion car crash.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “That sounds awful.”</p><p>“It is. I’m invested now, though.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, mouth full of salad. “Of course you are.”</p><p>The TV played in the background, but neither of them were really watching. It was one of those evenings that felt like it didn’t need to be defined. No pressure. No rules. Just bodies close enough to share the same couch cushion.</p><p>Rio reached behind her head, stretching slightly as she took a sip of her iced tea. “I actually listened to my trainer for once,” she said, offhanded. “Tried Muay Thai last week.”</p><p>Agatha looked up, surprised. “Muay Thai?” she repeated, clearly amused. “Since when are you into martial arts?”</p><p>“I’m not,” Rio said with a low laugh. “I mean—I never thought about it. He just kept nagging me about switching things up, and I needed something to get my brain out of the studio. Turns out I kind of liked it.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened. “Did you kicked anyone in the face?”</p><p>“Not yet,” Rio smirked. “Though I’ve been finding these random bruises since last Friday. Like, I keep forgetting about how it got there.”</p><p>She didn’t think much of it. Just kept eating. But when she glanced up, Agatha wasn’t laughing anymore.</p><p>Her expression had gone still—soft, but unreadable. And for a heartbeat, her gaze locked on Rio’s collarbone like it had found something invisible there.</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “What?”</p><p>Agatha blinked—once, then again—and suddenly her entire face changed. Not with alarm. Not even confusion. But clarity. Like something clicked. </p><p>And then, without a word, she beamed.</p><p>It was barely a smile. Just the slightest upturn of her lips, a shift in her eyes that warmed every sharp edge.</p><p>She didn’t say a word. Just scooted a little closer, like her body couldn’t help itself.</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes playfully. “Okay… you’re weirding me out. What’s up?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha said, voice featherlight. “Just picturing you in gloves and all that”</p><p>That wasn’t what she was picturing at all, Rio could tell. But she didn’t push. Because whatever that flicker of realization was—whatever tension had just unraveled in Agatha’s chest—it made her soft. And Rio had learned to take the softness when it came.</p><p>Agatha leaned in until their arms touched. Her head tilted toward Rio’s shoulder, like she might rest there again but wasn’t quite ready to settle.</p><p>Rio didn’t move away.</p><p>She just kept eating, her heart thudding a little too loud, a little too hopeful.</p><p>Agatha was close. Relaxed. Still smiling.</p><p>And Rio—still in love, still pretending not to be—let herself have this, just for now.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p><br/>

🙄</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>It was almost 2 a.m.</p><p>Rio ran the same song back for what felt like the billionth time that day, her thumb sliding over the trackpad as she adjusted the levels on her laptop again. But no matter how much she tweaked it, nothing sounded right. Her brain wasn’t cooperating.</p><p>She stared at the screen, her eyes bleary, jaw tight. The melody floated through the room in soft pulses, but her attention was elsewhere.</p><p>She hadn’t been able to concentrate all day. Not really. Every time she tried to focus, her mind drifted to Agatha.</p><p>They hadn’t seen each other in days. Work had swallowed both of them whole—deadlines, meetings, late nights—and while that was normal, it didn’t make the quiet easier. Not when Rio kept checking her phone like some idiot waiting for a text that meant something more than<em> “sent in the notes, x.” </em></p><p>Earlier that evening, Agatha had sent her a picture. Just her outfit for the night—something short and black and beautiful, with her signature wine-colored lipstick and a pair of knee-high boots that Rio had definitely helped her take off once or twice.</p><p>She’d captioned it with a simple “Wanda made me go out.”</p><p>Rio had tried not to feel anything. Tried not to imagine every person who’d look at Agatha tonight and think about touching her. Tried not to think about how she wasn’t allowed to be the one next to her in public.</p><p>Her chest tightened. She sighed, slumping further into the couch, letting her head fall back and her eyes close.</p><p>Maybe she could sleep. Maybe—</p><p>Her phone rang.</p><p>Rio jumped, startled by the sudden noise piercing through the quiet room. She glanced around in confusion, blinking as she tried to locate it. The screen lit up on the coffee table, vibrating beside an empty mug.</p><p>She grabbed it, squinting at the caller ID.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Rio frowned. Her heart skipped for a second—somewhere between hope and concern. Agatha never called her.</p><p>She answered. “Hello?”</p><p>“Babyyyyy,” Agatha slurred on the other end, her voice syrupy and slow. “Can you come pick me up?”</p><p>There was music in the background. Laughter. Glass clinking.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Are you drunk?”</p><p>Agatha giggled like that was a stupid question. “Mmmm. Little bit.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched. “You want me to come pick you up?”</p><p>“Pleeease?”</p><p>Rio sighed, her frustration bubbling up in the space between her ribs. So this was how Agatha’s rules worked, apparently. No going out together, but it was totally fine to call her like this in the middle of the night when she needed a ride home.</p><p>Still, she rubbed a hand over her face and said, “Where are you?”</p><p>“Hm.” Agatha went quiet for a second, like she had to think very hard about it. “I’m at… that dark place.”</p><p>Rio stared at the wall. “What dark place?”</p><p>“You know,” Agatha mumbled. “The one with the, like… the red lights and the stupid expensive cocktails.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, trying not to snap, “what dark place?”</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>“Are you mad at me?” Agatha asked, her voice small and wobbly.</p><p>Rio exhaled. Her chest softened despite herself. “No. I’m just trying to figure out where you are so I can come get you.”</p><p>“You said my name.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “What?”</p><p>“You never call me Agatha anymore,” she said, a little pouty. “Only gorge—gorgeous… and baby.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip so she wouldn’t groan, somewhere between a laugh and a whimper.</p><p>Agatha kept going, oblivious. “I don’t like when you say it like that. Sounds like you’re mad.”</p><p>Rio looked up at the ceiling, prayed for patience. “I’m not mad. Just—help me out, okay? What’s the name of the bar?”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment.</p><p>Then—“DARKHOLD!” she yelled so loud Rio yanked the phone away from her ear. “That’s where we are! Or I think Wanda’s still here somewhere—I don’t know, she was dancing with a girl”</p><p>Rio had already stood up, grabbing her keys from the hook by the door. “Okay. Baby, I’m coming to get you. Just… keep your phone close. I’ll call you when I’m outside, all right?”</p><p>“Okaaayyyy,” Agatha sing-songed. “Bye baby.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, the barest smile tugging at her lips despite herself.</p><p>“Bye,” she said, locking the door behind her.</p><p>The song was still looping in her earbuds as she stepped into the humid night air, but she barely heard it now.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Rio double-parked outside Darkhold. The place looked like a vague portal to hell, lit in red and pulsing with bass. She called Agatha, barely waiting for her to pick up.</p><p>"Hey, I’m outside."</p><p>A few minutes passed before Agatha finally stumbled out of the bar’s entrance, squinting at her phone screen, then lighting up when she spotted Rio’s car.</p><p>But Rio's breath caught.</p><p>Agatha's lipstick was smudged—badly. Not just from drinks or sweat. It was the kind of messy only kissing could make. Her hair was slightly tousled, the corner of her mouth flushed.</p><p>Something burned hot in Rio's chest.</p><p>Still, Agatha beamed and stumbled toward her like none of that mattered. She threw her arms around Rio’s shoulders, pressing messy kisses to her cheek, her temple, her neck.</p><p>“Thanks for picking me up, baby,” she said sweetly, slurring, pressing messy kisses along Rio’s cheek and neck.</p><p>Rio tensed. “Come on. Let’s go,” she muttered, guiding her toward the car.</p><p>It took a bit of maneuvering, but she got Agatha into the passenger seat.</p><p>“Where are we going?” Agatha asked, slumping into the seat, her words heavy with sleep.</p><p>“I’m taking you home,” Rio said, eyes fixed on the road.</p><p>“Nooo,” Agatha whined, “I wanna go to your place. Mine is too far. And I want you now.”</p><p>Rio let out another long sigh. Her place was closer. And she didn’t feel good about leaving Agatha alone like this. She gave in with a quiet nod.</p><p>By the time they arrived, Agatha had dozed off. Rio rounded the car, gently waking her with a soft touch to her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha groaned, then smiled, eyes half-lidded and affectionate. She clung to Rio as they made their way up to the loft, whining the whole way but never letting go.</p><p>She seemed to sober a little once they were inside the bedroom—enough to start trying to kiss Rio again, tugging at her shirt.</p><p>“Babe,” Rio murmured, catching her hands gently, “stop. You’re drunk. And I’m tired. Let’s just go to bed, okay?”</p><p>Agatha pouted but nodded. Rio helped her out of her outfit and into a worn pair of pajamas. She took off Agatha’s makeup with a practiced tenderness, and they brushed their teeth together in the bathroom, wordless and sleepy.</p><p>When they finally collapsed into bed, Rio expected Agatha to roll to her side like usual. But instead, Agatha pulled her in—tight, warm, clinging.</p><p>Rio froze. They’d never done this. Not without sex first. Another one of Agatha’s rules.</p><p>But she didn’t pull away. Because despite the confusion, despite the lipstick and the doubts still curling in her stomach, Agatha was here. Pressing soft, sleep-heavy kisses to her neck. Reaching for her like it's the only thing that matters.</p><p>It was getting harder—all of it. The blurred lines. The rules that kept being broken. The way it all felt so real sometimes, only to be followed by a playfulness that it's too detached to be seen as unintentional. Neither of them had the courage to talk about it. Or ask for more. They just kept pretending.</p><p>And Rio was scared. Because she loved Agatha—quietly, hopelessly—but moments like this felt like illusions. Beautiful, fragile lies she was too afraid to break.</p><p>Agatha nestled closer with a sleepy sigh, her breath tickling Rio’s skin.</p><p>“I’ve missed you this week,” she murmured, barely audible.</p><p>Rio’s heart clenched. A smile tugged at her lips despite everything. “I’ve missed you too, cariño.”</p><p>The petname slipped before she could stop, but Agatha beamed with her eyes still closed, and for a moment, Rio thought she’d drifted off. But then she whispered:</p><p>“Goodnight, love.”</p><p>Rio kissed the top of her head, curling around her. Holding her like the illusion might be real if she just held tight enough.</p><p>“Goodnight, mi amor,” she whispered back.</p><p>And if it was a dream, she didn’t want to wake up.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Agatha woke up slowly, blinking against the soft sunlight flooding the room. She didn’t even need to open her eyes to know where she was—Rio always forgot to close the curtains all the way, and it was always too damn bright. But it wasn’t just that. It was the warmth. The way Rio’s arms were still wrapped tightly around her, legs tangled. That sleepy, protective hold that made Agatha feel—dangerously—safe.</p><p>She smiled before she could stop herself, letting her body relax into the feeling. For a moment, she allowed it. Let herself linger in the quiet glow of morning and affection, even as a distant part of her brain whispered that it didn’t make sense.</p><p>She had gone out with Wanda to not end up here.</p><p>Agatha’s brows knit together slightly, trying to piece together the night before. She remembered the drinks—at least four or five—remembered dancing, Wanda disappearing somewhere into the crowd, and that moment when someone new came up behind her. A woman. Hands on her hips, lips brushing her ear. For a heartbeat, Agatha had leaned in.</p><p>She thought maybe that was what she needed. A reminder that she wasn’t tethered, that she didn’t need Rio. That she could still let someone else touch her, want her, pull her out of this messy emotional limbo.</p><p>But then the woman kissed her.</p><p>And it had felt… wrong. Not bad. Just empty. Off. Too fast or too slow, too much or too little, but never quite right.</p><p>She’d excused herself, muttering something about the bathroom. But the moment she was alone in front of the mirror, flushed and tipsy and heart hammering in her chest, she saw it in her own reflection:</p><p><br/>
The woman couldn’t touch her like Rio did.<br/>
She didn’t know how to read her the way Rio did. And the problem wasn’t her. </p><p>It was Agatha.</p><p>Because she didn’t want anyone else. </p><p>Not really.</p><p>The next part was a blur. She must have called. She barely remembers. Just Rio’s voice on the other end, the door opening, hands guiding her in, the feel of pajamas and brushing teeth and soft sheets. Glimpses, like snapshots. But the clearest thing was falling asleep wrapped up in Rio’s arms, warm and safe and… home.</p><p>She should get up.</p><p><br/>
She should <em> think </em> about what she’s doing.</p><p><br/>
But her body feels too good—too warm, too wanted.</p><p>She feels Rio stir behind her. Not fully waking, just shifting in that half-asleep way that still feels intentional. Her arm tightens, tugging Agatha closer. Then her lips find the back of Agatha’s neck, soft and slow, and Agatha can’t help the involuntary sound that escapes her throat.</p><p>Rio smiles against her skin.</p><p>She doesn’t need to see her face to know it. She can feel it, like the grin is pressed into her shoulder.</p><p>Rio kisses her again, this time with purpose, slow little drags of her mouth across warm skin, like she’s tracing a path she’s memorized but still wants to rediscover. When she reaches the shell of Agatha’s ear, she whispers, voice rough and low from sleep:</p><p>“Morning, gorgeous.”</p><p>Agatha exhales a laugh she wasn’t expecting. “Good morning, baby,” she murmurs, pressing back into her, fitting their bodies together like puzzle pieces that stopped pretending not to match.</p><p>Rio’s hand slides under her shirt—slow, smooth, familiar. There’s nothing overt in the touch. Nothing obscene. Just skin to skin. A claiming, maybe. Or a remembering.</p><p>But it <em> burns. </em></p><p>Agatha’s breath catches, her whole body prickling with heat, because somehow, this still makes her feel undone.</p><p>She reaches back, finds Rio’s hair, tangles her fingers in it. She pulls, gently, but with intent, and Rio answers without hesitation—pressing her mouth to Agatha’s neck again, kissing lower, then up along her jaw. Her breath is warm, her hands anchoring, and Agatha shivers, helpless against the way her body reacts.</p><p>There’s nothing rushed about it. No desperate tug, no frantic edge.</p><p>Just… slow, purposeful touches. The kind that only come from knowing. From learning a body like it was a language, until fluency becomes second nature. Rio touches her like someone who’s been studying. Like she’s memorized every soft sound, every place that makes her arch, every way Agatha tries to hide her need and fails.</p><p>And Agatha—</p><p>She gives in.</p><p>She turns in her arms, kisses her with intent. Her mouth moves like it has something to say, and maybe it does—maybe it’s a hundred things she’s too scared to say out loud. So she says it with her lips. With her hands.</p><p>She kisses Rio like <em> I missed you. </em></p><p><em><br/>
</em> Touches her like <em> I’m scared to want you this much. </em></p><p><em><br/>
</em> Moves against her like <em> I know this isn’t supposed to mean anything, but I don’t know how to make it mean less. </em></p><p>Her fingers slide under Rio’s shirt now, nails grazing skin, and it’s her turn to map the familiar terrain. She knows this too—knows how Rio responds when she lingers, when she takes her time. She explores like someone searching for answers in the only language either of them can bear to speak right now.</p><p>There’s heat, yes. But it’s not wild or hungry. It’s not about the sex.</p><p>It’s about being seen.</p><p>There’s reverence in the way their bodies move, unhurried and fluid. They touch like they’re trying to memorize each other all over again. Like they’re trying to say <em> stay </em> without saying anything at all.</p><p>Agatha’s heart aches.</p><p>Because she knows Rio is sure. She always has been.</p><p>But Agatha—she’s still figuring it out. Still terrified of what happens when the wanting becomes real. When feelings sour. When people stop trying. She’s not used to letting someone stay long enough to disappoint her.</p><p>And yet—</p><p>Every time she tells herself to stop, her body betrays her.</p><p>Because this isn’t casual anymore. Not really. Not when Rio holds her like this. Not when her lips say I see you. Not when Agatha’s own hands tremble with everything she won’t let herself ask for.</p><p>She’s still scared.</p><p>But it’s getting harder and harder to care about rules that don’t make sense anymore.</p><p>So she keeps kissing her. Keeps pressing her heart into skin. Keeps praying Rio won’t notice the truths she’s bleeding all over her body.</p><p>Or maybe—just maybe—hoping she will.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p>

<p>Rio couldn’t pinpoint how it happened, but something had shifted between them.</p><p>It wasn’t loud or dramatic. It was soft. Subtle. Like the way sunlight slowly stretched across a room in the morning—easy to miss if you weren’t paying attention, but impossible to ignore once you felt the warmth on your skin.</p><p>Agatha had been softer lately. Not entirely unguarded—Rio knew her too well by now to expect that—but she had been... more. More relaxed. More open. She didn’t flinch when Rio brushed hair out of her face. She didn’t pull away when Rio kissed the inside of her wrist just because. She lingered after sex, let her fingers rest on Rio’s chest like they were allowed to stay.</p><p>Rio didn't push Agatha to talk about that night. Not because of her own rule. But because she realized it didn't really matter to her who Agatha kissed that night, because in the end she had come back to Rio. Because Agatha’s body curled into hers, draped her arm across her stomach, and fell asleep next to her like her body already knew where home was.</p><p>And for the first time since this started, Rio didn’t feel like there was a boulder sitting on her chest. In all that chaos came something that brought her some peace, left her content.</p><p>The sex hadn’t changed much. It was still hungry, often demanding. They could still spend whole nights tangled in sheets and sweat, mouths moving faster than their thoughts. But now, there was also the way Agatha lingered. How she let Rio take care of her outside the bedroom too. Let herself be held. Let herself be known.</p><p>And Rio didn’t go all out, not yet, not completely. But she didn’t feel like she had to hold back as much anymore. Not when Agatha let her stay longer. Not when Agatha talked to her in a way that didn’t feel like it couldn't go beyond the surface.</p><p>She smiled to herself, staring at her computer screen where her latest project stubbornly refused to flow. Her headphones were snug around her head, blocking the city noise and playing loops of the same verse she’d been adjusting for the past hour. A mellow R&amp;B beat thumped in the background, but her mind is still very much in bed. Still with Agatha.</p><p>They had just survived another brutal week—deadlines, clients, meetings, everything crashing down all at once. Agatha had shown up at her apartment late the night before, dropping her bag with a groan and saying, “I need to be fucked until I forget what a pie chart looks like.”</p><p>Rio had laughed, kissed her against the door, and even though they were both exhausted, somehow they’d still stayed up late, tangled on each other and grinning.</p><p>Now Agatha was still asleep, and Rio didn’t have the heart to wake her up, not after the sleepless nights she knew Agatha had pulled to meet her deadline.</p><p>So she’d made coffee quietly, opened her laptop, and managed to get in a solid hour of work before her screen flashed with a notification—missed call from Mamá.</p><p>Rio sighed, shook her head fondly, and called back from her computer on FaceTime, knowing her mother would complain if she didn’t see her face.</p><p>The moment her mom picked up, she frowned dramatically, hands on her hips. “¿Nena, por qué no has llamado a tu madre?”</p><p>Rio smiled, indulging her mother like always. “Mami, he estado ocupada, lo siento. Estoy bien, lo prometo.”</p><p>Her mom clicked her tongue but melted anyway. The Spanish slipping in a warm embrace as they caught up, her dad joining in from the other side of the kitchen in their home. It was a soft, easy rhythm—updates, gossip, gentle ribbing.</p><p>Rio leaned back and adjusted her headphones. she didn’t hear Agatha calling her name. Didn’t hear the bedroom door creak open. She was completely unaware of the soft footsteps padding across the loft behind her.</p><p>So when Agatha leaned into the frame, pressing her face into Rio’s neck with a sleepy, "Good morning, baby," Rio jumped a little.</p><p>“Sorry, didn't mean to startle you” Agatha laughed softly, wrapping her arms lazily around her and kissed the side of her throat, entirely oblivious to the laptop camera still on in front of them. “I’ve been calling you. Are you done there?” she murmured.</p><p>Rio’s eyes went wide. She froze.</p><p>She reached up and pulled off her headphones, just in time to hear her mother’s delighted gasp come through the laptop speakers.</p><p>“Er—Agatha,” Rio said, her voice cracking. “I’m on FaceTime. With my parents.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. Then slowly leaned around to look at the screen.</p><p>Both of Rio’s parents were grinning far too wide.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said. She looked like she wanted to disappear. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt.”</p><p>The words were said to Rio, but her eyes flicked to the camera, like she was offering the apology to them too.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, trying not to panic. “It’s okay,” she said, then, without thinking, “You can stay if you want.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated—just for a beat. Her expression unreadable. Then she nodded, voice soft. “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha made her way to the front of the couch. Rio swallowed hard, following Agatha with her eyes, until she was sitting next to her, only then did she turn back to her computer, where her parents were looking at her with a surprised expression.</p><p>“Mom, Dad,” she said, voice a little steadier now. “This is Agatha.”</p><p>Her mom’s smile grew impossibly wider. “¿Es tu novia?”</p><p>Rio flushed. She glanced at Agatha, who thankfully didn’t seem to catch the question.</p><p>“Es complicado,” she muttered to her mom, then switched to English. “Agatha, these are my parents—Isabel and Carlos.”</p><p>Her dad gave a wave. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled politely, tucking a bit of hair behind her ear as she straightened her posture. “Nice to meet you too. Sorry for… interrupting your call.”</p><p>She looked shy, which was rare—careful with her words in a way she usually wasn’t. Rio knew it must be hard for her to be in the spotlight like this. And Rio had not meant for this to happen like this. She hadn’t meant for any of this to happen yet.</p><p>The last thing she wanted was to scare Agatha away.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t seem scared—just a little uncertain. And Rio could work with that.</p><p>“We were just catching up,” Isabel said warmly. “I was saying how I’ve barely heard from my daughter lately.”</p><p>Carlos nodded. “We were starting to think she’d forgotten about us.”</p><p>“She works too much,” her mother added pointedly. “But it’s nice to see her having some fun too.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio with a small smile, then looked back at the screen. “Yeah, I’ve been saying that to her, she needs some balance.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but smiled. The moment felt strangely domestic. And weirdly… easy.</p><p>Her hand, almost on its own, slid over to Agatha’s bare thigh—resting there gently. A silent reassurance. <em> You’re okay. This is okay. </em></p><p>Agatha looked down for a second, startled by the touch, then relaxed a little, her knee brushing into Rio’s as she shifted closer. Her body language softened, her tension gradually ebbing away in the few minutes that followed as her parents asked more questions—about Agatha’s job, what she liked to do and telling Agatha stories about Alice too when they found out about how they met.</p><p>Rio butt in whenever she could. But mostly she just let herself enjoy Agatha cautiously try to keep up with her parents rhythm.</p><p>Eventually, her mom glanced at the time. “We should go. It was so lovely meeting you, Agatha.”</p><p>“Same here,” Agatha said, smiling warmly. “Sorry again for barging in on your family time.”</p><p>“No problem, querida, you’re welcome anytime,” Isabel said, in a tone that made Rio want to launch herself into the sun.</p><p>They said goodbyes and ended the call.</p><p>For a second, Rio didn’t move. Didn’t even breathe. She stared at the blank screen, not daring to look at Agatha and risk breaking the moment.</p><p>But then, Agatha shifted closer, her head dropping gently to rest on Rio’s shoulder, like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Rio exhaled, finally.</p><p>“I’m sorry about that,” she said, voice quiet, still tinged with nerves.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha murmured. She let out a breathy laugh. “I’m the one who should be sorry. I was not expecting to meet your parents while still half-naked… Glad they couldn’t see that.”</p><p>Rio laughed—half mortified, half utterly charmed—and turned slightly, wrapping an arm around her. Agatha leaned into it without hesitation, settling into the space like she belonged there.</p><p>“Thanks for indulging them, baby.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in response, the corners of her mouth tugging up into a sleepy smile. “They seem sweet.”</p><p>“They are,” Rio said, her voice softening. Her fingers drifted lazily along Agatha’s bare arm, her skin still warm from sleep. “And they liked you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything at first, but Rio could feel her smile against her shoulder.</p><p>A beat passed. Then, Agatha tilted her head, her voice thoughtful. “So… you speak Spanish.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “I do.”</p><p>Agatha sat with that for a moment, like she was turning it over in her mind. Then she pulled back slightly, just enough to look at her.</p><p>“So does this mean I can call you papi in bed instead of daddy?”</p><p>Rio groaned, immediately burying her face in her hands. “Agatha.”</p><p>But the blush rising in her cheeks betrayed her.Agatha was clearly joking, but she caught it. The way Rio’s breath stuttered. The way her ears flushed. The way she didn’t actually hate the idea.</p><p>She didn’t press it though. Just grinned, smug but silent, and let Rio squirm.</p><p>They lapsed into a quiet that wasn’t awkward—just easy. Warm. The kind of silence that filled itself, no words needed.</p><p>So Rio let herself have that. Let herself enjoy it—the weight of Agatha’s body leaning into her, the warmth of her still there, the low hum of amusement between them, and the feeling that—accidental or not—this moment had been good.</p><p>Maybe even a little bit important.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>hey<br/>how long are you going to stay<br/>at Underworld today?</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🎧<br/>5-ish<br/>why?</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>my headphone finally took its last breath 🕊️<br/>i was wondering if you could<br/>help me pick a new one</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🎧<br/>i told you that thing was on life support lol<br/>but sure, i can swing by<br/>your place and we can go over some options</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>i was actually thinking about<br/>going to the store<br/>i need to see if they will be<br/>comfortable enough to spend<br/>too much time wearing them</p><p><b>Rio</b> 🎧<br/>sure<br/>i will pick you up when<br/>i'm done here</p><p align="right"> </p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>thanks, baby<br/>we can grab dinner after<br/>my treat</p><p><b>Rio 🎧<br/></b>ok, gorgeous<br/>i will text you when i'm omw</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>see you later 💜</p><p>

<br/>
</p><p>The sun had dipped just enough to cast golden streaks across the city when Rio pulled up to Agatha’s building. Agatha was already outside waiting, dressed casually but still deliberate—like someone who didn’t want it to look like she’d tried too hard but had definitely thought about it. As soon as she slid into the passenger seat, she leaned over and pressed a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek, one that felt more like habit than conscious choice.</p><p>Then she immediately started messing with the radio.</p><p>Rio groaned, hand swatting at her without looking. “Can you not?”</p><p>“You’ve been listening to the same three songs for a week,” Agatha said sweetly, skipping through Rio’s presets like she lived there. “I’m saving your reputation.”</p><p>“I’m a producer. That’s research.”</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha hummed, finally landing on a station she knew would annoy her—pop remixes with clunky synths and no bass depth. “You like this one?”</p><p>Rio gave her a sharp side glance, but didn’t change it. “You’re so annoying”</p><p>Agatha smirked and leaned back in her seat, resting her head against the window as they drove. Normally, she hated shopping on weekends—the crowds, the waiting, the endless decision-making—but the day was nice, she was restless, and, if she was honest, she wanted an excuse to get out of the apartment.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, one hand on the wheel, the other lazily tapping against her leg to the beat of the bad pop song Agatha was still making her listen to. “What are we looking for?”</p><p>“I need something comfortable,” Agatha said. “Noise-canceling. I can’t work anywhere but home lately—everywhere else is too damn loud.”</p><p>Rio nodded like she’d already figured that out on her own. “I know a place. It’s not far, and they’ll let you try stuff out. You’ll like it.”</p><p>The store was tucked into a quiet street, all dark wood and exposed speakers, like a café for audiophiles. The kind of place Agatha would’ve never gone into on her own. Inside, the rows of headphones were neatly displayed, each with tiny glowing labels and more specs than she could make sense of.</p><p>Agatha blinked at the wall of options, lips twitching like she was about to laugh.</p><p>“Jesus,” she muttered.</p><p>Rio stood beside her with her arms crossed, an amused smile tugging at her mouth. “Overwhelmed?”</p><p>“Completely.”</p><p>“Come here,” Rio said, gently taking her elbow and guiding her to one of the demo stands. “Start with this one. It’s mid-range, good noise canceling, comfortable cups.”</p><p>Agatha slipped it on, raised an eyebrow. “Not bad.”</p><p>Rio was patient—calm, easy, the opposite of how Agatha usually felt when she had to make a decision involving more than two options. She explained things without sounding condescending, helped her adjust the headband, even cued up a few demo tracks so Agatha could test how they felt with different sounds. She didn’t hover, but she stayed close, and Agatha liked that more than she expected.</p><p>Eventually, Rio handed her a slightly more expensive pair. “Try these. I think they’re better for long hours. The way you work, you’ll appreciate the weight distribution.”</p><p>Agatha slipped them on and sighed. “Okay. These are good.”</p><p>“I told you.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. Don’t gloat.”</p><p>At the counter, when Agatha pulled out her card, Rio slid hers forward too.</p><p>“I got it,” she said easily.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slapped over Rio’s without hesitation. “Oh my god, shut up. You are not paying for this.”</p><p>“But I want to get them to you,”</p><p>“Too bad, you're here to look hot while you geek out about sound or whatever, not to be my sugar daddy” Agatha said, firm. “Don’t be ridiculous.”</p><p>Rio groaned, blushing at Agatha's words and the way the cashier was looking at them.</p><p>Agatha looked at her satisfied and she finally let her hand fall back with a quiet laugh. “Okay, okay.”</p><p>The walk back to the car was slow, unhurried, the kind of pace that didn’t feel like it needed filling. Agatha found herself brushing her arm against Rio’s once, and when Rio didn’t pull away, she let it stay. She could feel the shape of Rio’s body next to hers—warm, steady, a little casual in that way she always was.</p><p>They reached the car, and Rio popped the trunk so Agatha could stash her new headphones inside their sleek little box. But instead of getting in, Agatha lingered on the sidewalk. She glanced down the street, her brow lifting slightly as something tugged at her memory.</p><p>“Oh,” she said, squinting toward a narrow side road just past the parking lot. “There’s a pasta place around the corner. Like, actually good pasta.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah. Wanda and I came here once when she was still working at that weird little gallery down the street.” She looked back at Rio, chewing on her bottom lip like she was weighing something. Then: “Do you wanna eat before we go back?”</p><p>Rio didn’t even hesitate. “Yeah. Sure. That sounds good.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, almost surprised at how easy that had been. She slammed the trunk shut and turned on her heel without another word, walking just a bit ahead until Rio naturally caught up beside her.</p><p>It was only a couple of blocks—long enough for Agatha to enjoy the breeze and the faint hum of the city, short enough that neither of them had time to talk themselves out of this... whatever this was. They weren’t walking like they were killing time. They weren’t hurrying.</p><p>There was something strangely intimate about walking to dinner after spending an hour trying to find her headphones, like they were an actual couple just... doing life.</p><p>And the quiet didn’t feel awkward. Not at all.</p><p>At one point, Rio bumped her gently with her shoulder. “You’re smiling.”</p><p>“I am not,” Agatha said, immediately defensive.</p><p>“You are,” Rio teased, grinning. “You get all smug when you know where the good food is. It’s cute.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t fight the smile threatening the corner of her mouth. “Shut up”</p><p>Rio pulled her by the waist and whispered in her ear. “You can make me”</p><p>Agatha could feel the shivers going down her body, but instead of kissing her, she put her hand over Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“Brat,” she said, poking at Rio’s side with her other hand.</p><p>Rio squirmed, letting her go, but they kept close to each other, soft smiles never leaving their faces.</p><p>The pasta place was small and tucked between a florist and a bookstore, its windows fogged faintly from the warmth inside and its outdoor tables covered in red-checked cloths like someone’s idea of a charming cliché. Agatha pushed the door open and stepped inside like she owned the place.</p><p>And Rio followed. Always followed, it seemed.</p><p>Neither of them said anything about it, but Agatha knew Rio must be feeling it too. This was public. This was new. This was real in a way they hadn’t fully figured out yet, but it felt good.</p><p>They were navigating something unfamiliar, and for now, that was enough.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Rio let out a soft laugh that melted into a gasp when her back hit Agatha’s bed, her hoodie catching against the comforter, eyes wide at the sight of Agatha already crawling over her like a slow burn.</p><p>She didn't exactly plan to end up here—not really. She’d only stopped by after work, still smelling like the studio, hair pulled back under a beanie, earbuds shoved into her pocket and the bass of her last mix still vibrating in her bones.</p><p>They’d eaten dinner on the couch. The TV was on, something forgettable playing in the background, but Agatha hadn’t said much. Just pushed her food around, eyes flicking toward Rio now and then, distracted.</p><p>Restless.</p><p>It didn’t take a genius to figure out why.</p><p>Two weeks. That’s how long Rio would be gone—back in San Juan to work on a big project with Benito, and staying an extra few days for her cousin’s birthday. It wasn’t a big deal. They weren’t dating. This thing between them was casual. Fun. Physical. No expectations. Rio kept repeating to herself.</p><p>Still.</p><p>She had caught the way Agatha’s knee bounced, how her fingers kept curling into the hem of her oversized sweater, like she didn’t know what to do with her hands. And instead of calling her out directly, Rio had leaned in with that crooked smile—the one she knew drove Agatha a little insane—and said:</p><p>“Hey… you wanna know what I was thinking?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a side-eye. “Do I?”</p><p>Rio nudged her thigh. “I think we should fuck each other senseless. Y’know… to make up for the time I won’t be here.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, rolled her eyes. “Very considerate of you.”</p><p>“I do my best,” Rio said with a grin. “But I meant it. You’re already all fidgety like you’re gonna lose your mind while I’m gone.”</p><p>“I’m not fidgety,” Agatha snapped, which only confirmed it.</p><p>And now—well. Now Rio was on her back, looking up at the woman who’d just stripped her out of her jeans like she was starving.</p><p>“You’re really committing to this send-off, huh,” Rio breathed, hands sliding up Agatha’s thighs as she settled between them.</p><p>“You started it,” Agatha said, eyes dark with something she wouldn’t name. “I’m just finishing strong.”</p><p>“Guess I won’t be able to walk straight on the plane,” Rio teased.</p><p>“That’s the idea.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her—deep, claiming, her tongue licking into Rio’s mouth with a hunger that made her moan. She didn’t bother holding back. Her mouth moved lower, kissing every inch of skin she could reach, lingering over the places that made Rio writhe.</p><p>Rio wasn’t used to feeling <em> missed </em> before she was even gone. She wasn’t used to anyone needing her like this.</p><p>And Agatha… Agatha was clearly not used to wanting anything this badly and not knowing how to ask for it.</p><p>It was easier like this.</p><p>Easier to press her into the mattress and leave trails of heat across her ribs and stomach. Easier to kiss behind her knee and pretend it was teasing, not desperate. Easier to trace her hands across every inch of Rio’s body like memorizing it might make two weeks feel shorter.</p><p>When she finally aligned the strap—slow, careful—Rio was already half-gone. Her eyes fluttered closed as Agatha pushed in, holding her tight with a steady rhythm that left no room for pretending this was just casual.</p><p>Agatha fucked her with purpose. No slow buildup. No games. Just sure movements and whispered filth and the kind of eye contact that made Rio feel split open in a way she hadn’t been prepared for.</p><p>“I love how you get all wet for me” Agatha murmured against her throat.</p><p>“Just shut up and fuck me,” Rio groaned, but her voice cracked slightly.</p><p>Agatha heard it. Felt it. But she didn’t</p><p>say anything.</p><p>Instead, she shifted her angle, kissed the corner of Rio’s mouth, and whispered, “I’ll make you feel it for days, baby.”</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Her pace stayed consistent, strong, steady like a beat Rio couldn’t shake. One hand held her hip, the other tangled in her curls, and her mouth kept kissing, praising, pressing words into skin like a spell.</p><p>“You’re perfect for me like this. Always so good. You gonna miss me, baby? Hm?”</p><p>Rio felt her stomach twist. Her eyes pricked unexpectedly, a sharp burn that made her blink hard.</p><p>Not now. Don’t do this now.</p><p>This wasn't the type of overwhelmed cry during sex. It was something raw she couldn't really explain. But something about the way Agatha was holding her—like she didn’t want to let her go, like this was her version of saying stay—it got to her.</p><p>Still, she didn’t say anything.</p><p>Just let herself fall into it. Let Agatha coax her to the edge, let the rhythm and the praise carry her. Her high hit hard, and when she came, Agatha kissed her through it, slowed down only when she knew Rio couldn’t take more.</p><p>She stayed there after, curled over Rio’s chest, sweaty and breathless, one hand still splayed across her stomach like she was trying to keep her grounded.</p><p>Neither of them said anything for a long time.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha whispered, “You better send me good playlists while you’re gone.”</p><p>Rio huffed a soft laugh, stroking the back of her neck. “You hate my playlists.”</p><p>“I don’t hate them. I just like pissing you off.”</p><p>“You’ll miss me,” Rio teased gently.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>But she didn’t let go either.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p><b>Rio 🎧<br/><img alt="" height="442" src="https://i.ibb.co/0VCjXD98/IMG-6189.jpg" width="300"/><br/></b>barely got here and my brother is already talking about work 🙄</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/></b>i’m sorry<br/>your what?!?</p><p>

<br/>
</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p align="center"> </p><p>It was a little after 9 p.m., and Agatha was four episodes deep into a Sex and the City rewatch, texting Wanda about every terrible decision Carrie Bradshaw had made in the last twenty minutes.</p><p>Normally, around this time, she’d be wrapped up in Rio—either literally or metaphorically. Dinner, sex, lounging around half-dressed trading jokes or music recommendations. It had become something of a rhythm between them. Familiar. Easy.</p><p>But Rio had been in San Juan for nearly two weeks now, and Agatha was getting a little bored.</p><p>Not lonely, exactly.</p><p>Just… lacking.</p><p>They’d been texting, sure. Even a couple of short calls squeezed between Rio’s sessions and Agatha’s late meetings. The occasional selfie.</p><p>But they hadn’t <em> seen </em> each other since Rio kissed her goodbye at her kitchen the morning before her flight. Still, despite the texts and late-night voice notes, something about the distance had begun to gnaw at her.</p><p>So when Rio’s name lit up her phone with a FaceTime call—at nearly 12:30 a.m. Puerto Rico time—Agatha didn’t even hesitate. She answered immediately, smile tugging at her mouth before she could stop it.</p><p>Rio’s face appeared, pillow-squished and bleary-eyed, hair up in a frizzy bun. “Hola, cariño”</p><p>“Well, well,” she drawled, adjusting the angle to look just unimpressed enough. “Look who finally remembered to call after midnight like a proper booty call.”</p><p>“Mmhm,” Rio mumbled. “I was lying here thinking about how tired I am and then thought, ‘Wait, I haven’t seen Agatha’s face in two weeks. I deserve that.’”</p><p>Agatha’s chest did a small, traitorous flutter. She tucked a hand under her cheek, shifting the angle of her phone. “You did see my face. I sent you like three selfies yesterday.”</p><p>“Not the same,” Rio said, voice thick with sleep. “Not real-time. I wanted your voice with it.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t hide the smile curling at her lips. “God, you’re clingy tonight”</p><p>“You’re loving it.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer that. She tilted her head instead. “So… how’d the main event go? Maria’s 30th. Did she survive?”</p><p>Rio groaned and buried half her face in the pillow. “Barely. I’ve now attended six birthday parties for the same woman. I think I might be a legally obligated member of the Maria Party Committee.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I still can’t believe she made her 30th a multi-week saga.”</p><p>“She said, and I quote, <em> ‘Thirty is a new spiritual portal, and I must honor it 30 times.’ </em>”</p><p>“That sounds fake,” Agatha said, laughing. “But now I’m regretting not celebrating mine enough”</p><p>“I swear to god,” Rio mumbled. “She had a dominoes tournament, a karaoke night, a beach bonfire, a ‘Miami Vice’ themed dinner—don’t even ask—and today was the final boss battle. I started helping set up around 8am. I got drunk before 2pm and sobered up just in time to start feeling hungover at the party. So that’s where I’m at.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “So you’re saying you hit the full spectrum: pregame, blackout, hangover, and emotional recovery—all in one solar cycle?”</p><p>“Exactly. My body thinks it’s Monday. It’s not.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, but her gaze lingered on Rio’s face. “You look tired. You should go to sleep.”</p><p>“I am tired,” Rio admitted. “But I wanted to see you first.”</p><p>Agatha looked down, smile softening. She didn’t say anything at first, didn’t trust her voice to come out steady. They’d kept this thing casual, kept it safe. But this part—missing someone this much and not quite knowing what to call it—that was uncharted territory.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, shifting slightly in bed. “Tell me what you did today. Please. I need to hear about someone who wasn’t attacked by a rogue inflatable flamingo in a pool.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Okay, well, my day was significantly less chaotic. I went to brunch with Wanda, we hung out a little after that, then I got back home ate dinner and got annoyed at Carrie for… well, being Carrie.”</p><p>“Sexy and dramatic?”</p><p>“Mostly annoying.”</p><p>Rio laughed, low and scratchy. “I miss annoying you in person.”</p><p>“I bet you do,” Agatha murmured. “But you’re coming back soon”</p><p>“Two more days,” Rio said, eyes fluttering closed. “Flight lands late Thursday. You’ll be around?”</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>They let that hang in the air for a second, warm and unspoken.</p><p>On screen, Rio let out a long breath, content and sleepy. “Good.”</p><p>Agatha watched her for a moment. Her hand ached to reach through the screen, to touch the curve of Rio’s jaw, to press a kiss to her shoulder. But she didn’t say it. Just settled into the quiet of the call, letting the sound of Rio’s breathing fill the space between them.</p><p>“Go to sleep,” Agatha whispered, her voice gentler than she meant it to be.</p><p>“I will,” Rio murmured, voice barely above a breath. “Just… stay a little longer.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even hesitate. “Okay.”</p><p>They lingered like that, the screen dimmed but still glowing faintly with Rio’s image. Her face, soft and unguarded, shifted from amused to sleepy as their conversation drifted between nonsense and comfort. Rio talked about the last batch of mixes she and Benito had been fixing, and Agatha told her about a strange neighbor she’d passed in the hallway who had a pet iguana on a leash. Rio had laughed so hard she coughed.</p><p>But slowly, Agatha started to notice the rhythm of Rio’s blinks changing, how her replies grew slower, warmer, slurred around the edges. Her breathing started to even out.</p><p>“You’re falling asleep,” Agatha said, smiling.</p><p>“‘M not,” Rio insisted weakly, though her eyes barely opened.</p><p>“Oh my god, stop being so stubborn. Just go to sleep.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved up faintly. And then—</p><p>“Okay, goodnight, cariño… I love you.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth moved before her brain could catch up.</p><p>“Love you too, baby.”</p><p>It came out so naturally. So effortlessly. Like she’d said it a hundred times before.</p><p>
<em> Shit. </em>
</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>Her pulse stuttered, panic blooming out from the center of her chest like something she couldn’t contain. Her whole body went still. She stared at the screen, horrified, almost expecting Rio to blink at her, suddenly alert, shocked, needing to talk about it.</p><p>But Rio was asleep.</p><p>Completely, peacefully asleep.</p><p>Her face had softened. Her breathing had deepened.</p><p>Agatha just… stared.</p><p>The words replayed in her mind like a loop she couldn’t shut off.</p><p>
<em> "Love you too, baby." </em>
</p><p>She hadn’t meant to say it.</p><p>Except… maybe she had.</p><p>And now that she’d said it out loud—even if Rio hadn’t heard—it was real. And that scared the shit out of her.</p><p>She fumbled to end the call, her thumb shaking as she pressed the screen off and tossed the phone aside like it had burned her.</p><p>She laid back, chest rising and falling too fast. Her room was too quiet, too sharp in its stillness.</p><p>This wasn’t supposed to happen. She wasn’t supposed to let this happen.</p><p>This thing with Rio—it had rules. It was supposed to be easy. Fun. Comfortable, yes, but surface-level. Skin-deep. Just enough to keep the loneliness at bay without ever opening the door to something that could truly hurt.</p><p>Somehow, they'd slipped past all that. Slowly. Silently.</p><p>It had crept in through the cracks. The way Rio looked at her when she thought Agatha wasn’t watching. The way Agatha saved Rio’s voice notes and played them again when she couldn’t sleep. The way it felt—every touch, every shared song, every time Rio made her laugh so hard her ribs hurt.</p><p>Agatha covered her face with both hands, pressing her palms against her eyes like she could stop the spiral.</p><p>This wasn’t just casual anymore.</p><p>It hadn’t been for a while.</p><p>Now it was something dangerous. Because she knew what happened when things got real. People changed. People left. Or worse—they stayed and disappointed you slowly until all that was left was the quiet grief of what could’ve been.</p><p>She didn’t want to do that again.</p><p>She <em> couldn’t </em> do that again.</p><p>Not if it was real.</p><p><br/>Not if it had teeth and could bite her back.</p><p>She’d spent her whole life building walls that kept her safe, and Rio had never asked her to take them down.</p><p>But maybe she had anyway.</p><p>And now Agatha had no idea how to put them back up.</p><p>

<p>“Okay, that’s it. You need to stop the self-pity party,” Wanda announced, standing in the doorway of Agatha’s apartment like a one-woman intervention.</p><p>Agatha barely looked up from her place on the couch, a throw blanket draped over her legs and an untouched cup of tea slowly going cold on the coffee table. The TV was playing reruns of Gilmore Girls, Lorelai’s voice chattering in the background like white noise. </p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Agatha mumbled, even though she absolutely did.</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes and crossed the room, dropping onto the couch beside her with a sigh that was half exhaustion, half exasperation. “Agatha, come on. You’ve been like this for weeks. I’ve seen crime scene photos with more color than you’ve had in your face lately.”</p><p>“It’s been three weeks,” Agatha corrected, staring at the screen. “Not exactly a lifetime.”</p><p>“It’s been almost three weeks since you ghosted your situationship and then blew up what you had with the person you were clearly in love with. And in those three weeks, you’ve turned into a haunted Victorian widow—except sadder and somehow less productive.”</p><p>Agatha let her head fall back against the couch cushion, groaning. “Can we not do this today?”</p><p>Wanda turned toward her. “Agatha. You’ve been stuck in this loop. Watching the same three shows, reading the same text thread, scrolling through her old stories. You’re not moving on. You’re hiding.”</p><p>Agatha flinched. “I tried to move on. It’s not like I didn’t try.”</p><p>“Right,” Wanda said dryly. “Because deleting your Instagram for five days and refusing to answer my calls is the same thing as emotional growth.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip.</p><p>She had tried. At least, she’d convinced herself that she had. But Wanda was right—everything she did since that night had been more about avoiding her feelings than working through them. And the guilt had been building like water behind a dam. She kept waking up thinking about Rio. Kept checking her phone even though she knew there wouldn’t be a message. Even her silence felt performative—like some backwards punishment she was inflicting on herself for what she’d done.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said, voice sharper now, “don’t you fucking dare pull this shit on me. I told you from the start this was going to get messy if you weren’t honest with yourself. I coddled you. I let you sit in your fear because I know how hard this shit is for you. But enough is enough. You need to take your head out of your ass and fix this.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned, a cold twist of dread blooming beneath her ribs. “What the fuck am I supposed to do, Wanda? She told me not to contact her again.”</p><p>“So that’s it? You’re just going to roll over and give up?”</p><p>“What else should I do? Show up at her house and ask her to be my girlfriend?” she snapped, more bitter than she meant to be.</p><p>Wanda made a dramatic gesture like exactly. “Yes. That. Be vulnerable. Be honest. Use your actual words for once.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breathless laugh. “You’re insane.”</p><p>“No, I’m just not scared of my own feelings.”</p><p>“That’s easy for you to say.”</p><p>“Actually, no, it’s not. You think this shit is easy for anyone?” Wanda leaned in, her voice low and cutting. “You keep acting like being scared gives you an excuse to hurt people before they get a chance to hurt you. But Agatha—Rio stayed. She put up with all your nonsense. She laughed with you, showed up for you, held you when you were too tired to talk, didn’t run when things got too close. You kept saying it was casual, but that girl showed up for you like it was anything but.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened.</p><p>She knew. She knew all of that. Knew it in the way Rio would press her forehead to hers after sex, in the sleepy voice notes she sent after long days, in the way she remembered Agatha’s coffee order better than Agatha did. She knew it in the way it hurt to miss her.</p><p>“I don't even know how to be honest about this,” Agatha said, voice smaller now. “I don’t know where to start.”</p><p>Wanda exhaled slowly. “Then start with the truth. Start with: ‘I’m sorry I hurt you.’ Then: ‘I freaked out because I realized how much I love you.’ Then—if she doesn’t kick you out—listen to her. Don’t defend yourself, don’t deflect. Just fucking listen.”</p><p>Agatha blinked down at her hands. “What if she still thinks this was just sex?”</p><p>“Well, can you blame her? You texted her in the middle of the night after ghosting her for weeks,” Wanda teased.</p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p>“Agatha, I know you are frustrated, but the only way for her to understand this is for you to say how you really feel,” Wanda said firmly. “Love’s not enough to make it work, but it’s a start. The rest—you’ll have to build that. With communication. With work. With showing up even when you’re scared shitless.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, quiet. “Yeah. I know.”</p><p>Wanda leaned in, her voice softer. “You’ve been stuck in this distorted spell for too long, honey. If you really want Rio in your life, you have to show her the truth. You have to let her see the version of you that wants to stay, not just the one who’s afraid to leave.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. Her heart was pounding. Wanda wasn’t wrong. She’d built this thing with Rio on silence, on suggestion, on touching without naming. They’d drifted closer for months—six of them—and Agatha had convinced herself that as long as she didn’t say it, she wouldn’t lose it. That silence meant safety.</p><p>But silence had never protected her.</p><p>It had only guaranteed the loss would come without a fight.</p><p>And now, with the echo of Rio’s absence stretched across every corner of her life, Agatha realized she’d rather risk the fall than keep pretending none of it mattered.</p><p>She took a shaky breath.</p><p>“I’ll try,” she whispered.</p><p>Wanda smiled, reaching for her hand. “That’s the spirit”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, eyes stinging. “She’s probably still mad.”</p><p>“And she has every right to be,” Wanda said gently. “But that doesn’t mean she stopped feeling everything else. She loved you. She probably still does. And even if she doesn’t let you back in, at least you’ll know you tried.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly.</p><p>It was time.</p><p>Time to stop pretending this hadn’t meant everything.</p><p>Time to be honest.</p><p>Time to show up.</p><p>She looked over at Wanda. “God, since when did you become so good at this?”</p><p>“It’s a gift,” Wanda said, smug as ever. “Now get your shit together. You have a woman to woo.”</p><p>Agatha smiled—tired, raw, but real.</p><p>Then she stood.</p><p>Wanda blinked up at her from the couch. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Going to her place,” Agatha said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes, gaze drifting pointedly over Agatha’s oversized sweatshirt, sleep-rumpled joggers, and hair that hadn't seen a brush since—well, probably last Tuesday.</p><p>“I mean…there is no better time than now, but do you really want to show up looking like a raccoon that lost its way home?”</p><p>Agatha turned, already halfway to the hallway, and flipped her off without even glancing back. “Fuck you”</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Wanda called after her, grinning. “Maybe consider not smelling like depression and popcorn before you confess your feelings. Just a suggestion.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, but the sound of her bathroom door creaking open a second later must have been enough to answer her best friend.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Rio had just gotten home, kicked off her shoes with a groan, hoodie halfway peeled off and clinging to her elbow. The apartment smelled faintly like incense from the stick she’d lit that morning, but all it did was remind her she hadn’t opened a window in days. The silence felt heavier than usual. No music. No voice notes. Just the buzz of the fridge and the weight of her own tired thoughts.</p><p>She was halfway to convincing herself that toast counted as dinner when the doorbell rang.</p><p>She groaned, dragging her feet toward the door. “Alice, I swear to God, if you don't sto—”</p><p>She opened the door.</p><p>And stopped.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Standing there in her hallway, like something out of a dream she’d worked really hard to forget. A takeout bag in her hands. Messy hair like she’d been pulling at it, biting her lips raw. Her eyes were tired and puffy, but bright—focused on Rio like she couldn’t look anywhere else.</p><p>Rio’s heart lurched before her brain could even process it. She hadn't seen Agatha in person in nearly two months. Not since before she went to visit her family.</p><p>She looked the same. She looked different. She looked familiar. And she looked like someone Rio had been trying to forget for nearly a month.</p><p>Her voice cracked something open with just a word. “Hi,” Agatha said, timid, like she knew this was a long shot.</p><p>Rio blinked. Her fingers curled slightly against the doorframe.</p><p>What was she doing here?</p><p>And why—why did part of her want to collapse into her right then and there?</p><p>The other part remembered how it felt to be left in silence.</p><p>“What are you doing here, Agatha?” she asked, keeping her tone cool even though her pulse was climbing fast.</p><p>Agatha flinched. Just a flicker. Just enough to be noticeable.</p><p>Rio almost hated how easily she caught it. How much she still noticed every detail about her.</p><p>“I—Can we talk?” Agatha asked, voice a little stronger this time. Her fingers clutched tighter around the takeout bag, her shoulders tense. “Please?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. She couldn't.</p><p>There had been so many nights she wanted this exact thing. That knock at the door. That soft “hi.” The apology she’d never gotten. And now Agatha was standing here—bruised and exhausted and real—and Rio didn’t know what the hell to do with it.</p><p>Because beneath all that longing was something colder. Something sharp.</p><p>Betrayal.</p><p>She hadn’t been just hurt when Agatha disappeared. She had been wrecked. Spinning in her own head, wondering what she did wrong, trying not to check her phone, trying to make sense of a silence that came out of nowhere after six months of something that was nowhere near casual as it was supposed to be. </p><p>And now here she was.</p><p>And Rio hated that her body still responded. </p><p>That some part of her—no matter how small—was relieved to see Agatha again. That her chest still pulled tight with the want of her, like the sea being pulled by the moon, and the tide of her feelings were just waiting to crash on shore.</p><p>She wanted to slam the door.</p><p>She wanted to pull her inside.</p><p>She wanted to say it was too late.</p><p>She wanted to forgive her already. </p><p>She wanted to do none of it.</p><p>Instead, Rio stared for a beat longer—until her own voice betrayed her and came out smaller than she meant.</p><p>“Okay,” she said, barely above a whisper. She stepped aside.</p><p>She didn’t look at Agatha as she walked past her into the apartment. Because if she did, she might feel too much again.</p><p>Agatha hesitated at the threshold, then stepped in. Quiet. Like she was afraid to make too much noise.</p><p>Rio shut the door behind her slowly, pressing her palm to the wood for a second before turning around. And when she did, Agatha was there in her living room again, like she’d never left.</p><p>And Rio didn’t know what the hell to do with the ache in her chest that said she’d missed her every single day since.</p><p>“I brought you food,” Agatha said softly, holding up the bag with an awkward little shrug.</p><p>Rio’s heart tugged in spite of herself.</p><p>“You don’t even know if I’ve eaten,” she muttered.</p><p>“Educated guess?” Agatha offered, trying for a light tone, but her voice wavered at the edges.</p><p>And just like that, Rio was back in that familiar scene all those months ago—standing by her door, somewhere between relief and heartbreak. </p><p>It was like her brain couldn’t stop running through all the what-ifs. What if she hadn’t fucked up that first night—hadn’t forgotten their date, hadn’t let her work took more of her time?</p><p>What if she hadn’t accepted the friends-with-benefits arrangement that felt safer at the time, but slowly hollowed her out?</p><p>What if she’d just been honest? From the beginning. About what she wanted. About what she felt. About how this thing with Agatha had started fast and physical, but had quickly burrowed somewhere deeper than her skin.</p><p>Would they be here now, tiptoeing around the rubble?</p><p>Would Agatha have ghosted her?</p><p>Would Rio have spent the last three weeks pretending she didn’t check her phone every damn night, just in case?</p><p>She didn’t move toward the food. Didn’t ask Agatha to sit. But Agatha stepped in anyway, setting the takeout on the coffee table and lowering herself onto the edge of the couch like she was approaching a live wire.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said quietly.</p><p>Rio didn’t look at her. “About what exactly? Disappearing? Leaving me without a clue of what happened? Or texting me in the middle of the night like I’m just a fucking booty call and not someone who shared a life with you for months?”</p><p>The words shot out before she could stop them—raw and sharp, carved straight from her chest.</p><p>Agatha flinched. Her shoulders curled inward for a second, then straightened again. “Yes. About all of that. I’m sorry I hurt you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond. Her hands curled into fists in her lap.</p><p>“But what I’m more sorry about…” Agatha continued, slower this time, “is starting this thing in the first place.”</p><p>That landed like a slap.</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped. Her throat went tight.</p><p>Right. Of course. This was regret.</p><p>Her jaw clenched, and she looked away—but then:</p><p>“I don’t mean it like that,” Agatha added quickly, seeing the devastation ripple across Rio’s face. “I mean… I’m sorry for letting you believe in something that wasn’t true. Or not telling you what was true, which is worse.”</p><p>“I’m not good at dealing with my feelings,” Agatha said, voice quieter now. “I think you know that.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “No shit.”</p><p>Agatha gave a ghost of a smile. “Okay, I deserved that.”</p><p>Rio didn’t smile back.</p><p>“This isn’t an excuse,” Agatha continued. “But maybe it’s a reason. Or the only one I can offer right now.”</p><p>“I haven’t been honest with you since the beginning,” she said. “When you missed our date, I told myself it was fine. But it wasn’t. I felt like… if I pulled back, if I could just detach a little, then I could keep you close without getting hurt.”</p><p>Rio’s brows knit, throat working hard to stay silent.</p><p>“I thought if we kept it light, kept it physical, I could survive it. I didn’t expect it to matter this much. I didn’t expect you to matter this much.”</p><p>Agatha let out a long breath. “I thought it would be easier that way. But there’s no easy when it comes to feelings. I was selfish, and I knew it, but I also knew I wasn’t ready. And somewhere in that mess, I decided it was better to hurt you first than give you the chance to hurt me.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened.</p><p>She’d known all of this. Somewhere in the back of her mind, buried under hope and longing and the casual rhythm they’d built—she’d always known. But hearing Agatha say it aloud still hit like a knife.</p><p>“I lied to myself,” Agatha said. “And worse—I let you believe the lie too. That this didn’t mean anything.”</p><p>A long pause settled between them.</p><p>Agatha’s voice dropped, softer than Rio had ever heard it. “But it did. It does. It always did.”</p><p>Rio finally looked at her.</p><p>“I know at some point,” Agatha said, “we both knew it. We just didn’t say it. We kept pretending. But it was there—in the small things. In the way you’d remember my favorite salad, or how you’d put your cold feet on me just to be annoying. It was there in how you always let me vent about work or how you let me be quiet when I didn’t have words.”</p><p>Her throat worked, her voice starting to crack.</p><p>“It was there in our bodies too,” she added, more fragile now. “They knew each other. They felt it too, right there under our skin.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched.</p><p>And then Agatha said it.</p><p>“That night I went out… I wasn’t planning to kiss anyone. But when it happened, it hit me. Not because I didn't know, but because it was clear. No one knew me like you. Not even close. I didn’t want to be there. I wanted to come home to you.”</p><p>Rio sat frozen, her heart pounding.</p><p>“You have became my home,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio didn’t even realize she was crying until a tear fell hot on her hand.</p><p>“I didn’t know how to say any of this. We never really talked like this. About our feelings. And every day that passed it was harder and harder to keep pretending.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice dropped even lower now, almost inaudible. “But that night… when you called me from San Juan, and you were tired and sweet, and your voice was so soft…”</p><p>Rio blinked at her.</p><p>“…you said you loved me,” Agatha finished. “And it was so easy for me to say it back. I didn’t even think.”</p><p>Rio blinked again, her voice a whisper of disbelief. “When I said what?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her gently, eyes brimming. “You were half-asleep. I think you might have let your guard down, because you said, ‘Goodnight, cariño. I love you.’ Like it was the most natural thing in the world.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard.</p><p>“And I said it back,” Agatha said. “Because it was true. I just didn’t know how to face it until it was already out in the air between us. And then I panicked, and I disappeared, and I broke the one thing I didn’t want to break.”</p><p>Her hand inched slightly closer on the couch.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Rio. I’m sorry I ran. I’m sorry I wasn’t honest. I’m sorry I hurt you.”</p><p>She exhaled. “But I love you. I’ve loved you for longer than I ever let myself admit. And if there’s any part of you that can forgive me… I want to try again. The right way.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak at first.</p><p>The pain was still there—anchored deep in her chest like it had settled in for good. But beneath it, something else stirred. Something old and soft and dangerously hopeful. A thing she’d tried to smother under silence and pride.</p><p>And now that Agatha had cracked herself open—now that the truth sat between them, exposed and raw—Rio didn’t know what scared her more:</p><p>That it might not be enough.</p><p>Or that it might be everything.</p><p>Her voice was quiet when she finally spoke. “We fucked something good, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch this time. She just waited.</p><p>“What exactly do you think will change now?” Rio asked, and it wasn’t bitter, but it was honest—too honest, and it made her throat tighten.</p><p>Agatha shifted slightly, looking at her like she already knew this part was coming.</p><p>“You're right, we did,” she said, steady. “But… Rio, our relationship was built on lies. Not malicious ones, not the kind people tell to manipulate or hurt—but the kind we tell ourselves when we're too scared to admit what we really want. The kind that feel like protection until they turn into walls.”</p><p>Rio looked down.</p><p>“I know the feelings were real. I know the good times were too,” Agatha said, softer now. “But we were never honest with each other. Not about what we felt. Not about what we feared. We danced around it until there was nowhere left to go but away.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, the ache in her throat sharp.</p><p>“But I see it now,” Agatha went on. “there was no way forward if we kept pretending. And I don’t want that again. Yes, I love that we can read each other well, but we can't really build a whole relationship around what we assume from each other. I don’t want us to go back to what we were. I want us to start from the beginning—openly, honestly.”</p><p>She glanced at her. “Not just saying how we feel, but saying what we fear. What we need. What we can and <em> can’t </em> handle.”</p><p>Rio blinked, eyes stinging again.</p><p>“And I’m not just saying this for me,” Agatha added. “This is about you too. You’ve always carried the weight of what I didn’t say. You gave me room, even when it cost you your own. And that wasn’t fair. It’s never been fair.”</p><p>Rio didn’t realize how tightly her hands were clenched until her fingers started to ache.</p><p>“If you ever agree to this,” Agatha said, voice barely above a whisper, “I want you to know that you deserve to love in a way where you don’t have to hold yourself back. Where you don’t have to hide or shrink or second-guess what you feel just because I’ve made it hard to show up for you.”</p><p>And Rio—Rio felt herself crumble.</p><p>Because this was everything she had wanted from the beginning. Not just the confession. Not just the love. But the space. The recognition. The offer to build something real instead of fragile and half-lit.</p><p>But now that it was in front of her, she didn’t know how to reach for it.</p><p>She was terrified of letting herself believe. Terrified of opening up again just to fall harder this time.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts—because of course Agatha could—she said gently, “You don’t have to give me an answer now. I’m not asking you to decide everything tonight. But I’d love the chance to be here. To try. Together.”</p><p>The silence between them was thick and humming with tension. But it wasn’t angry. It was waiting.</p><p>Rio took a slow, shaky breath.</p><p>And then, finally: “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded. </p><p>“I’m sorry for coming here unannounced and dropping all this on you,” Agatha said, already beginning to stand. “I’ll let you rest now. Don’t forget to eat and—”</p><p>But Rio reached out and grabbed her wrist.</p><p>“Have dinner with me.”</p><p>Agatha froze, eyes wide with surprise. Then she looked down at Rio’s hand, then back up—searching her face.</p><p>Whatever she saw must’ve been enough, because her shoulders relaxed and a small smile curved at the corner of her lips.</p><p>“Okay,” she said, and there was something warm in the word. Something hopeful.</p><p>“I’ll get the plates,” Agatha offered as she stood again, brushing her hair out of her face. “Can you pick something for us to watch?”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, letting go of her wrist.</p><p>She watched Agatha head into the kitchen, the sound of rustling bags and opening cabinets grounding her back into the moment.</p><p>There was a lot to go through. Still so much unsaid, so many pieces to untangle and rebuild.</p><p>But for now, just for tonight—Rio let herself have this.</p><p>The food.</p><p>The couch.</p><p>The woman who came back.</p><p>And the smallest flicker of something like peace, sitting just beneath the ache.</p><p><br/>

</b>ok</p><p>It had been a week since Agatha showed up at Rio’s door with food and apologies and a heart cracked open wider than it ever had been. Since then, they hadn’t talked about love again. Or pain. Or what exactly they were going to be now. But they had been talking. Soft, tentative exchanges scattered across the week like breadcrumbs.</p><p>It felt… strange.</p><p>Not in a bad way. Just new. Lighter, maybe. </p><p>Like she’d taken a weight off her shoulders—but now she was walking bare. Nothing left to hide behind. No sarcasm shield. No “it’s just casual.” Just her. Honest and exposed.</p><p>Every time she typed a text, she’d pause, catch herself censoring, softening, pulling back like she used to. And then she’d hit delete. Type it again. And send it this time as is. She was trying. Policing herself not to shut down, not to run. She knew now that letting Rio in wasn’t something she could half-do. That was the whole point.</p><p>That’s why she invited her.</p><p>They hadn’t seen each other since the night she left Rio’s apartment after dinner. A full seven days of letting the truth work quietly between them. Agatha hadn’t even realized she was thinking about asking Rio to come until she had already sent the text. But now, standing in the middle of a bustling street fair with Wanda haggling over beaded rings, the weight of it hit her.</p><p>This wasn’t just a casual invitation. This was her extending something real.</p><p>Because Rio had never really seen her like this—in the world. Not in the curated, quiet intimacy of dimly lit bedrooms and middle-of-the-night phone calls. Not inside the controlled space of their bubble. She had never met Wanda, which felt almost absurd now, considering how deeply Wanda lived inside Agatha’s everyday life.</p><p>And the truth was, Agatha hadn’t let herself get pulled into Rio’s world either. She never went to the studio, never saw Rio at work, never met the characters she spoke of—her friends, her team, her brother, her people.</p><p>Just Alice on that first night and the accidental run-in with her parents that Agatha still cringed about sometimes at 2 a.m.</p><p>It was easier that way. Safer. The fewer overlaps, the easier to pretend it was temporary. That it wasn’t serious. That it wasn’t going to hurt.</p><p>But now… she was done pretending.</p><p>She wanted Rio to see her in daylight. With Wanda making fun of her and the sun on her face. She wanted to see what that felt like—to let Rio be a part of this version of her, messy and imperfect and real.</p><p>And she was still thinking about all of that, half-distracted by the blur of movement around them, when her phone buzzed again.</p><p><b>Rio 🪷</b><br/>
done early<br/>
where exactly are you?</p><p>Agatha felt a flutter low in her stomach. She stared at the screen for a second longer than she needed to, before typing out her reply.</p><p>And for the first time in her life, she didn’t feel like she was waiting for something to magically go wrong.</p><p>She just felt… happy.</p><p>A few minutes later, she looked up—and there she was.</p><p>Rio moved through the crowd with that same calm, unfussed stride that always made it feel like the world would wait for her. She wore a loose black button-up over a plain tee, long, frayed denim shorts brushing her thighs, her familiar shaggy hair sticking out from under a cap. There was something easy about her, something undone in the best way, and Agatha felt her chest give one sharp tug.</p><p>She fit.</p><p>That was the first thought that bloomed in her chest, warm and terrifying.</p><p>Rio fit here.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Among the world Agatha had built for herself—carefully, stubbornly—and kept separate for so long.</p><p>And seeing her now, stepping toward her with that slight smile tugging at her lips and sunglasses pushed down the bridge of her nose, Agatha realized how much she had wanted this. How many times she had imagined Rio meeting Wanda. Rio laughing beside her not just behind closed doors, but here, out in the sun where she shines brighter.</p><p>It felt unreal. And yet—completely right.</p><p>When Rio reached her, she didn’t hesitate. She just opened her arms and Agatha didn’t think. She folded into the hug like it was a reflex—like her body had been waiting to exhale for a full week and could finally do so now.</p><p>“Thanks for inviting me,” she said, words caught somewhere between a breath and a confession. She didn’t let go.</p><p>“Thanks for coming” Agatha said softly, just as affected.</p><p>For a moment, they stood like that, cocooned in the quiet of each other, even as the fair bustled around them.</p><p>Then Wanda appeared beside them like she hadn’t been watching from the corner of her eye for the past minute. “I see you two found each other.”</p><p>They pulled apart—more from instinct than embarrassment. Agatha didn’t miss the amused glint in Wanda’s eye or the slightly smug smile she was trying to suppress.</p><p>“Rio, this is the pain in my ass and best friend, Wanda,” Agatha introduced, her voice light, casual—masking the intensity of what this moment meant to her.</p><p>Wanda gasped dramatically. But Rio just raised an eyebrow and grinned.</p><p>“Nice to finally meet you. Honestly, I was starting to think you were just Agatha’s imaginary friend.”</p><p>That made Wanda laugh, bright and easy. “You’re funny. I like you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, but her heart swelled. This—this effortless banter, this shared space—it meant more than she could ever say out loud.</p><p>Wanda started walking toward the next booth.</p><p>“We were trying to figure out where to eat. Any suggestions?”</p><p>“There’s a great Mexican place a couple blocks away,” Rio offered, slipping seamlessly into the conversation. “Burger joint the other direction. Some hole-in-the-wall spots on the way we can check out if you want.”</p><p>“Mexican sounds good to me,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Works for me,” Wanda added.</p><p>“Great,” Rio said. “Let’s go.”</p><p>They turned to walk, Agatha falling into step between them—and then something unexpected happened.</p><p>As they moved through the crowd, Rio’s hand brushed against hers. Once. Twice. Then without ceremony, without even glancing her way, Rio slid her fingers between Agatha’s like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>She didn’t even seem to notice she’d done it. Just kept chatting with Wanda like it was second nature.</p><p>But Agatha felt it everywhere.</p><p>Her pulse jumped. Her breath caught. She wasn’t sure if it was surprise or joy or the quiet ache of something too good to name.</p><p>So she squeezed Rio’s hand, gently.</p><p>And for the briefest second, Rio glanced over her shoulder—eyes bright beneath her sunglasses—and winked. Just once.</p><p>Then she turned back to Wanda, not missing a beat.</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak. She didn’t have to.</p><p>She let herself fall into the rhythm of their walk, their voices, their laughter. Let herself be held by the simple fact that Rio was here. Beside her. In her life.</p><p>And she didn’t feel scared anymore.</p><p>Just... known. And for the first time, maybe even a little bit safe.</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Rio thought she’d be more nervous to meet Wanda.</p><p>But either Wanda was making an effort to put her at ease—or she was genuinely just that easy to talk to. Funny, sharp, and a little chaotic in a way that didn’t feel performative. She didn’t prod or pry, didn’t treat Rio like an outsider, just folded her in like she’d always belonged.</p><p>When their food finally arrived and Agatha unwrapped her order, Wanda squinted dramatically at the plate and let out a delighted little gasp.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she said. “Of course you know she doesn’t like parsley.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, shooting her a look. “You’re so annoying.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Yeah, she’s ridiculously picky. I started keeping notes.”</p><p>Wanda snorted, clearly thrilled. “You have a whole database, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha reached across the bench to pinch Rio’s side. “This was a mistake. I should’ve never introduced you two.”</p><p>“Too late, babes,” Wanda sang, flicking the paper wrapper from her straw at her. “We’re bonded now. This is forever.”</p><p>Rio laughed, biting into her taco, but she was only half listening after that.</p><p>She couldn’t stop glancing at Agatha.</p><p>There was something about seeing her like this—lounging beside her on a sun-warmed bench, hair in soft waves from the wind, lips curled into reluctant smiles every time Wanda launched into another ridiculous story. Something real. Open. Less armor, more warmth. She was snarky and defensive, sure, but not closed off. Not the Agatha Rio had grown used to navigating with caution, always a breath away from pulling back.</p><p>And Rio realized with something soft and aching in her chest—she hadn’t gotten to see this before.</p><p>Not like this.</p><p>She wanted to. She wanted to see every version of Agatha there was, all the mess and mystery and sharp, golden corners of her. She wanted to know what her laugh sounded like when she wasn’t holding back. She wanted to sit next to her like this on every kind of day.</p><p>Beneath the table, Rio reached out and gently touched Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>Agatha glanced over, brows raising in mild confusion, but Rio just smiled at her—quiet and full of something she wasn’t ready to name. And Agatha smiled back. A little too fond.</p><p>They went like that for the rest of lunch. </p><p>Laughing. Letting things flow. Wanda pulled out a never-ending reel of embarrassing stories—Agatha sulking over a broken shoe, screaming at a pigeon, drunkenly attempting karaoke at a Halloween party—and Agatha groaned and whined and bickered, but didn’t actually tell her to stop.</p><p>Rio couldn’t remember the last time a lunch had felt like that. Like something you missed the moment it was over.</p><p>And she did miss it, just a little, when they stepped back onto the sidewalk and Wanda stretched her arms overhead with a groan.</p><p>“Well, this has been nice,” Wanda said. “But I have to get my son from day care.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Wait—you have a son?”</p><p>Wanda gave her a deadpan look. “My dog.”</p><p>“There’s a dog day care?”</p><p>“You would be shocked how extra it is,” Agatha muttered. “They pick him up in a little van like a school bus and everything” </p><p>“I work to give my child the life he deserves.” Wanda added proudly. </p><p>Rio barked a laugh. “You’re unbelievable”</p><p>“I get that a lot,” Wanda said, already pulling her phone out. “You coming?” she asked Agatha.</p><p>Agatha hesitated. Looked at Rio.</p><p>And before she could say anything, Rio spoke. “I can give you a ride.”</p><p>It slipped out without a second thought.</p><p>Wanda grinned like that was exactly what she wanted. “Awesome. My Uber’s here anyway. Bye, Rio. It was really nice meeting you.”</p><p>“Same,” Rio said, genuinely. She watched Wanda hop into the waiting car, then turned back to Agatha.</p><p>“My car’s back at the studio,” she said, suddenly a little awkward. “If you don’t mind walking.”</p><p>“Walking’s fine,” Agatha said, voice softer now. Shy in a way that made Rio’s chest tug.</p><p>So Rio reached out and took her hand again. She didn’t think about it. Didn’t wait. Just went with her guts.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes went comically wide, clearly caught off guard, but she didn’t pull away.</p><p>Rio smiled. “Relax,” she said gently, giving her fingers a light squeeze. </p><p>Agatha made a face, but her cheeks pinked slightly as she laced their fingers together more tightly. And together, they started walking—hand in hand, like it had always been that simple.</p><p>The late afternoon sun had started to dip lower in the sky by the time they reached the front lot. It wasn’t much—just a patch of cracked asphalt outside the warehouse building, tucked behind an overgrown fence and marked by the worn black sign that read UNDERWORLD in peeling white letters.</p><p>Agatha looked around, curiosity flickering in her eyes, but Rio was watching her too closely to really care about anything else.</p><p>She slowed to a stop a few feet from her car and turned toward her. Her hand tightened slightly in Agatha’s, pulling her just a little closer—not enough to surprise her, but enough to feel intentional.</p><p>“Do you want to see my studio?” she asked, voice quieter than before, like the question held more weight than the words themselves let on.</p><p>Agatha looked up, surprised—not in the startled way, but like something she wasn’t expecting had gently rearranged her. “Really?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her throat working around the simple reply. “Yeah. I mean… if you want to.”</p><p>Because the truth was, she’d thought about it. A lot. What it would be like to bring Agatha into her space—not just into her life, but into this part of her that most people didn’t really get to see.</p><p><br/>
Her studio wasn’t just work. It was hers. Her history. Her heartbreaks. Her best instincts. The place she’d poured herself into again and again, whether she had the words to explain it or not.</p><p>And with Agatha… they’d spent so long in that glass dome of theirs—quiet bedrooms, coffee-stained mornings, guarded silences that never asked too many questions. Agatha never wanted to see her here. And maybe somewhere deep down, she’d known what it would mean if she did.</p><p>So now, standing here—sunlight catching in Agatha’s lashes, her fingers still resting loosely in Rio’s hand—it suddenly felt like the most important thing in the world. To let her in. </p><p>For real.</p><p>Agatha’s smile was soft but it broke across her face like dawn. “Yeah,” she said, like it was obvious. “I’d love to.”</p><p>And just like that, Rio felt it again—that ache—the one that had followed her from the first time Agatha ever smiled at her like that. Like Rio was something lucky she’d stumbled into.</p><p>She swallowed around it and reached for the carabiner clipped to her belt loop, tugging the keys free as they headed toward the entrance.</p><p>“No Kate?” Agatha asked as they walked the short distance to the warehouse door.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Nah. She only works weekends if the other studios are booked.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. </p><p>“Besides she actually has a date today,” Rio chuckled, unlocking the heavy door with a low click. “Yelena finally asked.”</p><p>Agatha gasped so loudly Rio had to laugh again. “No way. I thought we were going to die of old age before they actually got their shit together.”</p><p>“Same,” Rio said with a grin. “She made me swear not to text her unless someone dies.”</p><p>“God, I’m so happy for them” Agatha muttered fondly and Rio felt herself smile as she led her down the hallway, the dim light from the overhead bulbs caught the dust motes in the air.</p><p>They passed rows of old amp cabs and folded mic stands before reaching the door at the far end—the one with the chipped black paint and “Lady Death” scribbled in Sharpie near the handle.</p><p>Rio paused, heart thumping louder than she wanted to admit. Then she turned the knob and pushed the door open.</p><p>“Welcome to the genius lab,” she said, stepping aside and trying not to sound self-conscious.</p><p>Agatha stepped in slowly, her eyes moving across the space like she was cataloguing every detail—the guitars on their wall mounts, the overlapping sound panels, the monitor still glowing faintly blue in the low light.</p><p>The place was far from pristine. There were mismatched mugs on a shelf near the synth rack, a half-eaten protein bar beside a stack of lyric drafts, tangled cables on the floor and a lopsided rug someone had spilled something on months ago.</p><p>It wasn’t perfect. But it was hers.</p><p>And something about seeing Agatha in this space made Rio’s chest feel too tight for words.</p><p>Agatha turned to her with a bemused expression and a smirk that tugged at one corner of her mouth. “Genius lab?”</p><p>Rio shrugged one shoulder, trying to downplay the ridiculousness of it. “Hey, branding matters.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she smiled. Not a deflective smile, not a mask—just something warm and true.</p><p>And Rio suddenly felt like it might be okay—being seen like this. Letting someone walk all the way in.</p><p>Because Agatha was here.</p><p>And she wasn’t looking for a door out.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">📱⚡️📱</p><p>Agatha walked slowly around the studio, fingertips skimming the tops of amps and tangled cables, eyes trailing over framed gig posters, lyric scraps, and instrument racks. Now that she was finally here, she wanted to take it all in—every detail of Rio’s world that she’d never seen, never allowed herself before now.</p><p>From her seat at the desk, Rio watched her. Quietly. Fondly. Like she couldn’t believe Agatha was actually standing here.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha looped back around and stopped in front of her, her lips twitching up. “This is really cool,” she said, and for once she meant it without sarcasm.</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair with a smirk. “Yeah? Am I finally shedding my loser title?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head and grinned. “Nah. That’s permanently tattooed on your forehead.”</p><p>Rio laughed, reaching out to tug her closer by the hands. Her fingers drifted down to Agatha’s shorts, brushing against the fabric playfully.</p><p>“Nice shorts,” she said, too casual to be innocent.</p><p>Agatha glanced down, already clocking where this was going. “Thank you. I love them.”</p><p>“They look familiar,” Rio said, letting her fingers trace a slow line along Agatha’s thigh. “Like, maybe… the ones I asked about a few months ago? That you swore you hadn’t seen?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, feigning confusion. “Hmm. Doesn’t ring a bell.”</p><p>Rio pinched her leg in retaliation and Agatha yelped, jerking reflexively. But she was still a little tangled in Rio’s legs, and the sudden shift caused Agatha to stumble forward—catching herself just in time by planting her hands on the arm of Rio’s chair, face now mere inches away from hers.</p><p>Their eyes locked.</p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s breath on her lips, her hand now resting securely on Agatha’s waist. Holding her. The closeness made her heart thunder against her ribs.</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha breathed.</p><p>Rio didn’t let go. Instead, she gently guided her to perch on the edge of the desk beside her, Agatha's legs in between Rio, their knees brushing. Agatha stayed frozen for a beat, caught in the feeling of Rio’s hands, her warmth, her steadiness.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me come here,” Agatha said softly, like it mattered more than it sounded.</p><p>Rio looked up at her, expression open and sincere. “I’m glad you wanted to”</p><p>Agatha felt her throat tighten unexpectedly. So she just nodded, unsure if she could speak yet.</p><p>Rio let out a slow breath, like she was gathering something heavy in her chest. “I’ve been thinking… about what you told me last week.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart thudded. “Yeah?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes found hers—steady, open, but with that faint flicker of vulnerability Agatha had come to recognize. “When you told me… about that night. The call from San Juan. How I told you I loved you and I didn’t even remember saying it.”</p><p>Agatha felt her stomach twist gently, but she nodded. </p><p>Rio gave a small, tired smile. “I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. Because for so long, I thought you ghosted me because I’d done something wrong. I thought maybe I’d pushed too far, or said too much. That I’d ruined it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes filled fast. “Rio—”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said gently, holding up her hand, not to stop her, but to let her finish. “I know that’s not what happened now. But back then… when you disappeared, and I didn’t know why, it felt like my heart just—” She stopped, blinking hard. “It felt like I’d been dropped mid-sentence. Like I was in the middle of building something real, and then you were just… gone.”</p><p>Agatha looked down, ashamed. “I’m sorry, I was scared.”</p><p>“I know you were,” Rio said. “And I’m not mad at you for that. I get it more now. But I need you to understand something too.”</p><p>She pulled herself closer. “You disappearing without a word—it made me question everything. Made me feel stupid, like I imagined the whole thing. I thought I had made something out of nothing. That I cared more than you did. That I was wrong to think it meant anything.”</p><p>Agatha looked up at her, eyes glassy. “You weren’t wrong.”</p><p>Rio gave her a small smile—sad and warm all at once. “I know that now. But back then… it made me feel like I wasn’t enough. Like you saw all the ways I loved you and still chose to run. And I kept thinking—God, how could I still want her when she left me like that? But the truth is… I did. I still do.”</p><p>She ran a hand over her face, like she was trying to clear away the lingering ache of it.</p><p>“And the worst part?” she said, softer now. “Is that I didn’t even blame you. Not really. When I sat long enough with what you said to me last week, I realized… you were right we’d never actually been honest with each other. We kept pretending we could keep things casual, or light, or safe. But we were both already in too deep.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart swelled with something that felt like grief and hope braided together.</p><p>“I thought I was being patient,” Rio continued. “Like if I kept showing you—with my actions—what this could be, maybe you’d believe in it too. I thought that was selfless. But the truth? I was also being a little selfish because I was scared too. It was easier for me to keep my feelings to myself than risk getting rejected by you. But in the end I was waiting for you to love out loud, when I never did that with you.”</p><p>Agatha breathed out shakily, tears rolling down her cheeks now.</p><p>“Even in our best moments, we were still hiding. Still holding back. We built something nice, yeah, but we never gave each other our full selves. Just the parts we thought were safe.” Rio said.</p><p>Rio reached up and took her hand, her thumb brushing lightly across Agatha’s knuckles. “I don’t want to do that anymore.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her through watery eyes. “Me neither.”</p><p>She held Agatha’s hand in between both of hers. “So. Let’s do it differently now. Let’s try again—but for real this time.”</p><p>Agatha blinked through her tears. “For real?”</p><p>“Yeah, just one rule though,” she said, her voice lightening just a little, teasing—but still achingly sincere.</p><p>Agatha let out a soft laugh, despite the tears. “Only one?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio smiled, but her eyes were still glassy. “Be honest. Even when it’s scary. Especially when it’s scary. No more hiding. No more pretending.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, overwhelmed but steady. “Okay.”</p><p>“I know we’ll mess up,” Rio said. “We’re still us. But as long as we talk through it… I think we’ll be okay.”</p><p>“I know I don't have the best track record here,” she said shakily, “but I’m not going anywhere this time, I swear.”</p><p>Rio’s smile was soft and reverent. “Good. Because I don’t plan on letting you run anymore.”</p><p>Agatha let out a wet laugh. “I’m sorry I ran. It’s still so hard for me to believe it’s okay to want this much, to feel this much. I’m still scared that what they've told me my whole life is true…that I’m hard to love after all”</p><p>Rio stood, cupping her cheeks and brushing her thumbs along the tear tracks. “Baby,” she said, voice aching with truth, “you are not hard to love. Don't ever let that get into your head. It’s okay to be scared. I’m scared too. But I love you. All of you. Even the messy, scared, complicated parts—especially those.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her like she was seeing sunlight for the first time in months. “I love you too, so much I didn't even knew it was possible”</p><p>Rio smiled, brushed a thumb across her cheek. A beat of silence passed between them. Heavy. Sacred.</p><p>She didn’t know who moved first.</p><p>Maybe it was her.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Maybe it was Rio.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Or maybe it was just inevitable—two magnets finally allowed to pull toward each other without resistance.</p><p>Their lips met softly, like they’d both dreamed of this moment but were afraid to break it. There was no urgency, no fireworks—just warmth. A quiet, steady kind of yearning. Like the kind of kiss you give when you're finally allowed to breathe again.</p><p>Agatha leaned into it like she was leaning into something sacred. She could feel Rio’s hands—one cupping her jaw, the other still at her waist. She smelled like cedarwood and citrus and something distinctly hers, and Agatha wanted to sink into her, to memorize her again, piece by piece.</p><p>When they broke apart, Agatha didn’t pull back. She stayed close, forehead pressed to Rio’s, eyes closed, heart thudding like a steady drum against her ribs.</p><p>She felt like she was home. For the first time in a long time.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio whispered, voice low and smiling.</p><p>Agatha let out a soft laugh, choked up but warm. “Hi.”</p><p>Neither of them moved. The studio around them was quiet—just the low hum of equipment, the soft whir of the fan overhead. And their breath. In sync. Tangled. Familiar.</p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed under her eye gently. “Hey,” she said, her voice quieter now, more tentative. “Do you wanna… see what I’ve been working on with Benito?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Really?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. I mean… I’ve been thinking about it. About us. And I realized… I want you to see every part of me. Not just the parts that are safe or easy. I want to share things now. Like this.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. “I’d love to.”</p><p>She meant it. So much it hurt.</p><p>Rio smiled and gently tugged Agatha to sit next to her. She opened her laptop, a few quick clicks revealing a project file in her DAW. Then she pulled her headphones off the rack, but Agatha shook her head. “Play it on the speakers,” she said, barely above a whisper. “I want to hear it with you.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then nodded and adjusted the output.</p><p>The track started low—Benito’s voice smooth and relaxed, rapping over layered percussion and a beat that felt sun-warmed, like the streets of San Juan baked into melody. The bass kicked in, grounding it with something rich and alive. Rio’s work in the production was amazing—polished but warm, full of details you could only catch if you were really listening.</p><p>Agatha was.</p><p>She sat still, soaking it in, her eyes flicking over to Rio as if trying to see the song through her.</p><p>And then—</p><p>A soft harmony. A breathy “mmm.” Just a tiny vocal run tucked behind the chorus.</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed, and then she smiled.</p><p>“You said you weren’t singing on this,” she said, eyes still fixed on the speakers, but her voice carrying something fond.</p><p>Rio chuckled softly. “I’m not. It’s just a few ad-libs. Background stuff.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, eyes shining. “I know your voice.”</p><p>Rio blushed.</p><p>And Agatha’s heart squeezed.</p><p>Because that was it, wasn’t it? That was love. Knowing someone’s voice even when they tried to hide it in the corners. Catching the shape of them in the quiet spaces. Wanting them exactly as they were.</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” Agatha said after a beat. “All of it. The music. The detail. And hearing your voice in it—it’s like…” she trailed off, searching for the words. “It’s like being let in.”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, that soft, bashful smile tugging at the corners of her lips.</p><p>“I want to let you in,” she said. “All the way.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything right away. Her throat was tight again, her chest too full. But this time, the ache wasn’t a bad one. It was the kind of ache that came from having everything you’d quietly longed for finally placed in your hands.</p><p>She nodded slowly.</p><p>Then moved closer and kissed Rio again, deeper this time. Steadier. Her hands found Rio’s face, one thumb resting gently on her cheekbone. She felt the soundboard press against her side, the faint vibration of the track still playing, but all she could really feel was her. Warm. Real. <em> Here. </em></p><p>She was allowed to love this freely. To be loved this freely.</p><p>It was overwhelming in the best way. Like standing under a waterfall, arms outstretched.</p><p>When they pulled back again, Agatha didn’t let go.</p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered. “For showing me this. For letting me be part of it.”</p><p>Rio leaned into her touch, eyes closed for a moment. “You're always welcome here”</p><p>They stood like that for a while—music still playing, the room wrapped in the golden hush of shared intimacy.</p><p>Agatha felt like she was falling in love all over again. Only this time, there was nothing hidden. No conditions. No fear.</p><p>Only freedom.</p><p>And the warm, impossible feeling of being loved in return.</p><p align="center">💜🎧💚</p>

She was almost done—she just needed shoes, her jacket, and her bag.</p><p>When she was satisfied with her reflection, she grabbed her phone again and quickly typed:</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/>
</b>hey, swing by my place before you head out?<br/>
we can go together<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b>wan 🍓<br/>
</b>on my way 😎</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grinned, dropping the phone in her bag. She couldn’t help it—the smile came easily these days.</p><p>They were going to Alice’s concert tonight. More than a year after she’d gone to that first one—the one where she met Rio. Back then, she never would have guessed they’d end up here.</p><p>Six months into dating for real, and Agatha had learned something that still surprised her: she actually <em> loved </em> being in a relationship. Not just with anyone—with Rio.</p><p>Things had shifted so much since they stopped holding back. Rio’s place and hers had begun to blur together, clothes and records and coffee mugs showing up in both without either of them thinking twice. Agatha knew the exact brand of tea Rio liked and kept it stocked. Rio had learned to always give Agatha at least 30 minutes of quiet time after she came back from the office. They grocery shopped together now, argued about what counted as “staples,” and had somehow fallen into the habit of cooking at least two dinners a week side by side—Rio with music humming low in the background, Agatha stealing tastes off her spoon.</p><p>It wasn’t perfect. They still bickered over stupid things—who hogged the blankets, whose turn it was to do laundry, whether pineapple belonged on pizza—but the difference now was they didn’t retreat into silence afterward. They’d learned how to talk it through, to say the thing instead of swallowing it.</p><p>And in between the everyday life stuff, there was still all the teasing and flirty banter they’d had from the beginning—only now it came with a kiss pressed to her temple mid-conversation, a hand at the small of her back in crowded places, the quiet kind of intimacy that made her feel claimed and cherished all at once.</p><p>It felt easy. Fun. <em> Solid. </em></p><p>Wanda’s Uber was already idling at the curb when Agatha stepped outside, the cool night air brushing over her bare legs. She pulled open the door and slid into the back seat.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened immediately. “Jesus, Agatha,” she said, looking her up and down with an exaggerated whistle. “Rio’s gonna pop a boner the second she sees you.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, trying to hide her grin behind a shake of her head. “Classy, Maximoff.”</p><p>“What? I’m just telling you the truth,” Wanda said, smirking as she pulled the door shut. “You look hot. Like… dangerously hot.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t help feeling a little smug at the thought.</p><p>The drive wasn’t long, and when they pulled up, the venue loomed bigger than the one from last year. The hum of the crowd outside was electric. Agatha’s stomach flipped—partly from excitement for Alice, partly from anticipation of seeing Rio.</p><p>They bypassed the long line, flashing their VIP passes at the door. Inside, the air buzzed with chatter and the low thump of the bass from the sound check.</p><p>“Alright,” Wanda said, immediately scanning the space, “I’m hitting the bar. You want anything?”</p><p>“I’m good,” Agatha said distractedly, already glancing around the floor.</p><p>No sign of Rio.</p><p>She figured she was probably still with Alice backstage, making sure everything was set for the show. Still, her fingers twitched toward her phone before she could stop herself.</p><p align="right"><b>me<br/>
</b>hey baby<br/>
just got here<br/>
where are you?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waited for a couple of minutes, but when an answer didn't come, she decided to scope out the place, weaving through clusters of people until she found a decent vantage point. The venue had a wide stage, balcony seating overhead, and the low buzz of a crowd still waiting for the night to start. She let her eyes roam, half expecting to spot Rio somewhere in the mix.</p><p>That’s when the backstage door to the left swung open.</p><p>And there she was.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse tripped over itself.</p><p>It didn’t matter that she’d been seeing Rio almost every day for the past six months, or that she’d memorized the slope of her shoulders, the weight of her hand on the small of her back, the way she smelled when she came home late from the studio—somehow, seeing her like this still made something in Agatha’s chest go molten.</p><p>Rio stepped out with that easy, unhurried confidence that made people turn to look without even realizing why. Dressed in all black, the loose, slouchy trousers and sleeveless vest showed just enough to tease at the muscles on her arms and along her ribs. Her hair was perfectly mussed, the kind of style that looked accidental but definitely wasn’t. The low light caught on the chain at her throat and the small hoop in her ear.</p><p>Agatha was halfway to a full-on daze when she noticed who was next to her.</p><p>A curvy redhead—shorter than Agatha but not by much—was walking right alongside Rio, leaning in as she spoke. She was laughing at something, and Rio was smiling in that soft, private way Agatha knew too well.</p><p>The sting hit low in her stomach, sharp and familiar.</p><p>Nope. She was not having that.</p><p>It wasn’t that she didn’t trust Rio—God, she trusted her more than anyone—but she did not appreciate anyone else getting that close, looking at her girlfriend like they could just… reach out and touch.</p><p>Rio was hers.</p><p>And no one else got to drool over her.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw set as she started making her way through the crowd toward them, her eyes fixed on Rio’s profile. She didn’t even care that she was probably staring like she was ready to fight someone. She just knew she was not about to stand here and watch some pretty stranger try to inch their way into her girlfriend’s space.</p><p>She didn’t slow down as she crossed the space between them—heels clicking against the floor, eyes locked on her girlfriend. Without thinking twice, she slid an arm around Rio’s waist, pressing her body flush to hers, and kissed her cheek like she was staking a claim.</p><p>Rio stiffened for half a heartbeat—just long enough for Agatha to notice—before her mouth curved into a smile that made Agatha’s chest unclench.</p><p>“Hi, baby. I’ve been looking all over for you,” Agatha said, her voice dropping into that low, sultry register she knew perfectly well how to use. It was meant for Rio’s ears only, though she wouldn’t have minded if the redhead caught the edge of it too.</p><p>If Rio noticed, she didn’t show it.</p><p>“Sorry, cariño,” Rio murmured, warmth in her voice as she tilted forward to leave a quick peck on Agatha’s lips. “I was trying to keep Alice calm. I didn’t know you were here already.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, letting her hand linger against Rio’s side before turning her attention to the other woman. Her smile sharpened just slightly. “And who is this?”</p><p>The redhead rolled her eyes like she’d been expecting the question, but extended her hand anyway. “Natasha Romanoff.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Agatha,” she replied, her own smile turning downright wicked. “Rio’s girlfriend.”</p><p>Natasha’s lips twitched, and under her breath, she muttered, “<em> Bozhe, yesli ty reagiruyesh' kak storozhevaya sobaka, to mogla by uzhe i pometit' Rio. </em> ” <em> ( </em> Geez, if you’re gonna act like a guard dog, might as well pee on her too.* <em> )<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha didn’t catch it at first—at least, she didn’t think anything by it—until a very familiar snort came from right behind her.</p><p>“Hey, guys. Sorry, the bar was packed,” Wanda announced breezily as she joined the group.</p><p>She glanced at Natasha, then smirked and replied. “<em> Kstati, smeshnaya shutka. I ne perezhivay, Agata tol'ko na slovakh derzkaya. </em>” (Nice one. She gets like that sometimes. Don’t worry, she’s mostly all bark and no bite.*)</p><p>Natasha’s smile turned sly, and she lowered her voice—still in Russian—“<em> Kstati, ya absolyutno ne zainteresovana v yeye devushke. </em> ” (By the way, I'm not interested in her girlfriend at all.*) Her gaze slid deliberately to Wanda, eyes glinting. “ <em> No ty, dorogusha, drugoye delo. </em>” (But you, my dear, are a different matter.)</p><p>Wanda’s lips curved, her tone matching Natasha’s playful heat. “Noted.”</p><p>“What the fuck are you talking with her?” Agatha demanded, narrowing her eyes between them.</p><p>“Nothing, just greeting her,” Wanda said innocently, then added with a grin, “I’m Wanda, by the way—this menace’s best friend.” She jerked her thumb toward Agatha.</p><p>Rio, ever the peacekeeper, stepped in before Agatha could press it further. “I’m glad you’re all getting along. Lena was a little worried Natasha would feel left out if she came alone, but I told her you guys would love her sister.”</p><p>Agatha felt the heat rise up her neck. Yelena's sister. Of course. And now she was the one looking like she’d shown up ready to claw someone’s eyes out for no reason.</p><p>Still, she kept her arm firmly around Rio’s waist. Sister or not, there were some things worth making very clear.</p><p align="center">💜🎧💚</p><p>By the time the opening act was halfway through, Rio had finally managed to drift with Agatha toward a quieter pocket of the venue. They were still close enough to feel the bass thump in their chests, but far enough from the others that the noise was just a little muted, like the rest of the world had taken a step back to give them space.</p><p>She slid in behind Agatha, wrapping her arms around her waist and pressing her chest to her back. “You’re ridiculous,” she murmured into her ear, close enough that her lips brushed warm against the edge of her jaw.</p><p>Rio didn’t need to see her girlfriend’s face to know she was biting her lip. She knew the body language by heart—the faint tilt of her head, the slow inhale she tried to disguise.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Agatha said, voice all mock-innocence.</p><p>“Oh, mi diabla, you know exactly what I’m talking about,” Rio murmured, letting her lips brush just under Agatha’s ear. “The way you practically marked me in front of everyone.”</p><p>Agatha let out a low chuckle, her fingers gliding over Rio’s hands where they rested on her hips. “Funny coming from you,” she teased, tilting her head slightly. “Wasn’t it you who almost growled when that girl at the bar asked for my number last week?”</p><p>“That was different,” Rio said quickly, but the flush creeping up her neck betrayed her.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Mhm. Sure, baby. Sounds like someone else gets a little territorial too.”</p><p>The opening act played on, the bass vibrating through the floor, but here—half-hidden in the shadows of the crowd—they were locked in their own slow burn. Rio’s hands roamed lazily, fingertips brushing the sheer fabric of Agatha’s tights, just enough to make her press back into her.</p><p>Agatha gave a small, dry laugh but didn’t deny it. She didn’t need to. Rio already knew.</p><p>The thing was—this wasn’t a real problem for them. They’d talked about it enough times, in those late-night, half-asleep conversations where the truth always came out. Both of them knew no one could actually come between them. Not Natasha, not anyone. They were locked in too deep for that. But every now and then, the little flashes of possessiveness—Agatha’s hand slipping tighter around her waist, Rio’s voice dropping a shade too sharp when someone flirted too long—were… hot. It was like being reminded, without words, you’re mine.</p><p>“You know,” Rio murmured, her lips grazing the shell of Agatha’s ear again, “I don’t mind you being like that. It’s hot. Makes me feel…” she paused, her smile audible, “…owned.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply but kept her voice steady. “Careful, baby. You say things like that and I might just take you up on it right here.”</p><p>Rio’s low laugh was almost drowned by the music. “Don’t tempt me, mi vida. You look dangerous enough tonight.” Her gaze slid deliberately down Agatha’s outfit—the feathery black jacket, glittering shorts, and those knee-high boots. “You’re walking around looking like the kind of trouble people write songs about.”</p><p>Agatha finally turned in her arms, their bodies flush, her hand finding the back of Rio’s neck. “And you’re acting like the kind of trouble that gets people dragged into dark corners.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, her pulse stumbling before it found a quicker rhythm. “Don’t say things like that…” She let her nails graze lightly over Agatha’s side, right where her shirt left a sliver of skin bare. “…or Alice might have to play an encore before we even make it to see her.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, leaning just close enough for Rio to feel the whisper of her breath. “We’re here to support your best friend.”</p><p>“Mm-hm,” Rio said, eyes flicking deliberately down Agatha’s outfit, exactly the kind of thing that made it impossible to look away. “And this is purely for supportive reasons?”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk deepened, but she didn’t answer. Instead, she let her fingers trail along Rio’s jaw, slow and deliberate, the kind of touch that made it impossible to think about anything else.</p><p>The opening chords for Alice’s set hit, and the crowd erupted. The two of them stepped closer to the stage, but neither loosened their grip. Every bass note, every shift in the lights seemed to heighten the electricity between them.</p><p>They didn’t dare take it further—not here, not now—but both of them knew they were playing with fire, pushing each other’s buttons in a game they both knew wasn’t going to end until much later… and in much less clothing.</p><p>Even in the crush of the crowd, Rio kept one arm hooked low around her girlfriend’s waist, fingers pressing into the warm curve of her hip through her jacket. Every time the crowd surged forward, Agatha leaned back into her just enough to make Rio’s chest tighten.</p><p>She didn’t need to ask if Agatha was doing it on purpose—she absolutely was. And Rio wasn’t innocent either. She found herself leaning in under the guise of whispering about the setlist, letting her lips brush the shell of Agatha’s ear, catching the subtle shiver that followed.</p><p>It was their own little orbit, one no one else could break into. There was still something intoxicating about this—keeping each other close, the subtle claims made with a hand on a hip, a thumb stroking at a bare patch of skin, the way Agatha’s nails would ghost over Rio’s thigh when the lights went low.</p><p>And it only got worse once the set was over. Backstage, the noise shifted from roaring bass to the warm hum of voices and clinking bottles. Alice was beaming, flushed from the performance, and Rio hugged her tight, murmuring how proud she was. Agatha chimed in with her own congratulations, still standing so close their arms brushed with every movement.</p><p>They lingered for a while, laughing with the small group that had gathered. That’s when Wanda sidled up with a knowing smirk. “You two are disgusting,” she teased, making a vague gesture at their still-interlocked hands.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “You’re just jealous.”</p><p>Wanda scoffed, but before she could bite back, Rio caught sight of Natasha—standing just behind Wanda—sliding a hand low against her back. Comfortably low. Rio’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile, locking eyes with Wanda for just a second. Wanda’s smirk faltered for half a beat, and Rio didn’t need words to make her point. <em> Right. We’re the disgusting ones. </em></p><p>When they finally stepped out into the cool night air, it didn’t go unnoticed that Wanda and Natasha drifted off together, their heads ducked close in quiet conversation. Agatha raised an eyebrow, and Rio just shrugged, the corner of her mouth curling like she was sitting on a secret.</p><p>The second they were in the backseat of the Uber, the air between them snapped tight. The restraint they’d kept all night dissolved like it had never existed. Agatha was on her instantly, one hand fisting in the front of Rio’s vest as her mouth claimed hers in a kiss that was more heat than air.</p><p>Rio groaned against her lips, sliding a hand into Agatha’s hair, tugging just enough to pull a soft gasp from her. “All night, cariño…” she murmured between kisses, “…you’ve been driving me insane.”</p><p>Agatha’s laugh was low and dangerous against her mouth. “Good. I want you thinking about me every second.”</p><p>“As if I ever don’t.” Rio’s reply was almost a growl, her thumb brushing over the sharp angle of Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>The city lights strobed through the car windows, painting them in fleeting flashes of gold and shadow as they kissed like they couldn’t get enough, like the hours of teasing had wound them too tight to do anything but burn now. Neither cared that the driver could hear the soft, muffled sounds between them.</p><p>All that mattered was getting home—because once they did, there’d be no crowd, no stage lights, no interruptions.</p><p align="center">💜🎧💚</p><p>The door had barely clicked shut before Agatha was on her.</p><p>Rio’s back hit the wall with a soft thud, and Agatha didn’t waste a second—her hands found the edges of that open black vest, dragging it wider until the bare strip of skin underneath was flush against her. She could smell the faint mix of Rio’s perfume and the electric tang of the concert still clinging to her hair, see the way her short, messy layers framed her smirk.</p><p>“You’ve been testing me all night,” Agatha murmured, voice low and threaded with heat, her hands sliding under the hem of Rio’s vest to her warm stomach.</p><p>Rio tilted her head like she was about to play innocent, but Agatha caught her mouth before she could speak. The kiss was all teeth and need, no softness yet—the kind of kiss that made Rio’s hand find Agatha’s hip in an instant, grip tightening through the fringe of her top.</p><p>“You like when I do,” Rio managed between kisses, but her voice wasn’t as steady as she probably wanted it to be.</p><p>Agatha’s smirk deepened. “Yeah. I do.” She kissed her again, slower this time, dragging it out until she felt Rio’s body push forward, trying to close the last millimeter between them. Then she broke away, lips brushing the shell of Rio’s ear. “But you’re mine, baby.”</p><p>The quiet groan Rio let out went straight through her.</p><p>Without giving her a chance to recover, Agatha’s hands slid lower, hooking into the waistband of those loose black pants, tugging Rio toward the bedroom. She didn’t have to pull hard—Rio followed like she always did when Agatha’s voice got that certain edge.</p><p>Inside, Agatha gave her a push so she landed sitting on the bed, legs spread just enough to make the invitation obvious. The sight of her there—vest open enough to tease, top showing way too much skin, chest rising fast—made Agatha’s pulse kick. She stepped between Rio’s knees, fingers tracing along her arm before curling around the back of her neck and pulling her in for another kiss.</p><p>Rio’s hands were on her thighs immediately, sliding up over her tights until they found the warm skin under the hem of her shorts. The heat of her palms was distracting, dangerous, but Agatha had no intention of losing control just yet.</p><p>She broke the kiss to look down at her—really look. “Take this off,” Agatha said, and it wasn’t a request.</p><p>Rio’s grin turned slow, deliberate, but she obeyed, tugging the vest and top free in one smooth motion. Agatha’s gaze followed every inch revealed, taking her time, because she knew Rio liked to be watched like this.</p><p>When Agatha finally leaned down again, she let her teeth scrape lightly along Rio’s jaw before kissing her there. “Mine,” she said again, softer now but no less certain. She knew—and Rio knew—it wasn’t about possession. It was about belonging. About every wall they’d taken down to get here.</p><p>And then Rio pulled her down onto the bed, flipping them so fast Agatha barely had time to gasp. The mattress caught her back, the springs giving with a soft creak as Rio’s weight pressed her down.</p><p>Agatha’s first instinct was to reach up, to drag her nails over the curve of Rio’s waist and anchor her there, but Rio was already kissing her—deep, greedy, her mouth tasting like the last sip of her martini and the rush of adrenaline still buzzing between them.</p><p>Agatha let her take the lead for a beat, let herself sink into the way Rio’s hands roamed like they were mapping territory she’d crossed a hundred times but still wanted to relearn.</p><p>The rough glide of her palms over Agatha’s tights, the impatient tug at the waistband of her shorts, the subtle, hungry press of her hips—all of it made Agatha’s head tilt back into the pillow, her lips parting on a sharp breath.</p><p>But it was Rio’s eyes when she pulled back that hit harder. Dark and intent, yes, but threaded through with something else—that unshakable, wide-open love that always managed to get under Agatha’s skin no matter how fast her pulse was racing. It was enough to make her throat feel tight for a second, the kind of tight that wasn’t about restraint but about recognition.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She just looked at her like that, her fingers curling against the bare strip of Agatha’s stomach where her shirt had ridden up, her touch warm, steady, grounding.</p><p>Agatha could feel herself unraveling in two directions at once—heat clawing up her spine and that quiet, dizzy ache of being loved so completely she almost didn’t know what to do with it.</p><p>“You’re… unfair,” Agatha murmured, voice whinier than she meant, brushing her thumb over Rio’s jaw in a slow, almost tender stroke before catching the back of her neck and pulling her back down.</p><p>The kiss was harder this time—not quite a takeover, but close—her teeth grazing Rio’s bottom lip before her tongue chased the sound she made. Agatha’s legs shifted, knees bracketing Rio’s hips, letting her girlfriend press in closer. She could feel the rhythm of her heartbeat where their bodies met, feel the way Rio’s hunger never canceled out her care, and it made Agatha want to give her everything and still demand more.</p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to look down at her, lips wet, breathing uneven. “God, look at you,” she teased, her voice thick. “Already wrecked, and I’ve barely touched you.”</p><p>Agatha’s laugh was sharp, but her pulse kicked at the words. “You’ve been teasing me since the concert,” she bit back, tilting her chin up. “So unless you plan on doing something about it—”</p><p>She didn’t get to finish. Rio’s mouth was at her neck in the next breath, teeth catching at that sensitive spot just above her collarbone before she bit, hard enough to pull a startled sound from Agatha—something between a gasp and a yelp. The sting bloomed into heat immediately, and she could feel Rio’s smile against her skin as she soothed the mark with a slow, lingering kiss.</p><p>“Stop being a brat,” Rio murmured, low and warm against her throat, “or I’m going to make this as slow as I can.”</p><p>Agatha barely had time to narrow her eyes before Rio’s hands were under her shirt, pushing the fabric up and off of her. Cool air swept over her skin for a fleeting second before Rio’s fingers found her nipple, giving it a deliberate pinch—a sharp, electric jolt that made her hips twitch up in reflex.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered, breath catching, but Rio was already shifting lower, her mouth closing over her other breast.</p><p>It really wasn’t fair—how easily Rio could undo her, how quickly she could make her forget she’d ever intended to stay in control. Part of her hated it, or at least pretended to, but God, she was good.</p><p>Her fingers slid into Rio’s hair, gripping tight as teeth grazed just enough to make her nerves sing. The warmth of her mouth contrasted with the faint scrape, and Agatha’s spine arched toward her without conscious thought.</p><p>Rio moaned against her skin, low and unrestrained, and the vibration rolled through Agatha’s chest, down her stomach, making her toes curl. “You’re doing that on purpose,” Agatha breathed, voice already slipping toward a plea she wasn’t ready to admit.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer—not with words. Her free hand settled at Agatha’s hip, thumb pressing into the curve like she owned it, anchoring her there. Each slow drag of her mouth was calculated, pulling Agatha’s focus into the heat and pressure until it was all she could think about.</p><p>Rio’s mouth roamed lower, her warm breath ghosting over skin and sending a shiver up Agatha’s spine. She felt each exhale as if it were a deliberate touch, designed to keep her just on the edge.</p><p>A soft, almost smug bite landed just above her hip, enough to make her gasp and clutch the sheets. Before Agatha could fully recover, Rio was pushing herself up, and Agatha swore she saw Rio’s pupils darken.</p><p>The hum that followed—low, satisfied, appreciative—hit Agatha in her stomach. “Already ruined,” Rio murmured, her gaze fixed on the damp lace of her panties like it was proof of something she already knew.</p><p>Agatha bit back a smirk, refusing to give her the satisfaction. “Maybe if you’d kept your hands to yourself at the venue,” she said, her voice steady even as her body betrayed her, “I wouldn’t be like this.”</p><p>Rio’s grin sharpened, all challenge. She leaned forward, bracing herself over Agatha, one hand pressed into the mattress by her hip. “So this is my fault now?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers slid up into her hair again, tugging just enough to make her breath hitch. “Yeah,” she said, smirk returning as her eyes raked over Rio’s flushed face, “You know it is.”</p><p>That earned her another sharp nip, this one higher on her thigh. The bite stung—bright and hot—and Agatha felt Rio’s smug, satisfied smile press against her skin like a dare. The mark throbbed, a little heated bruise blooming where Rio’s teeth had closed, but it was the look on Rio’s face that set Agatha’s pulse racing: that arrogant, slightly pleased expression that always meant Rio knew exactly what she was doing and enjoyed the fallout.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened in Rio’s short hair, not enough to hurt, just enough to lift her head so their eyes met. The angle made Rio blink, the bravado wobbling into something more honest—a catch of breath, a tilt of vulnerability Agatha relished. For a second she watched Rio’s throat work, watched the way her nostrils flared and how the short hair at the nape trembled where her fingers curled.</p><p>“That’s enough teasing, baby,” Agatha murmured, her voice low as velvet. She leaned in until her lips brushed Rio’s brow. “Put those fingers to a good use.”</p><p>For a moment, Rio didn’t move. She just stared at her, that heat in her eyes darkening, her chest rising with a deeper breath. Then, with a muttered “So bossy,” she shifted her weight forward, the mattress dipping under her knees as her hands slid higher on Agatha’s thighs—deliberate, steady, almost taunting in their slowness.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse was a drumbeat in her ears.</p><p>She tugged harder, and Rio made a small sound—equal parts plea and promise. The tug did what it always did: made the grounded woman in front of her tilt toward need. It was hot how quickly Rio’s composure slipped when Agatha did something as small as that.</p><p>Agatha felt proud of the effect she had, and she felt protective, too; the two feelings braided together in her chest and warmed her from the inside out.</p><p>Rio’s hands moved first, not to push Agatha away but to anchor herself—one palm splayed on Agatha’s hip, the other finding purchase on the mattress. Then, slowly and deliberately, she obeyed, easing her fingers up Agatha’s thigh in feather-light strokes that left a trail of heat. Each pass was teasing, teasing until it wasn’t: circling, pressing, testing where the line between restraint and surrender lay.</p><p>Her breath hitched with each small, precise exploration. She loved the way Rio set the pace now—confident but considerate, hungry but always watching for the tiny signals that said when to press and when to hold.</p><p>“I love when you get like this, mi ángel” Rio murmured against the hollow of Agatha’s throat, voice thick with the amusement that always lived there when she watched Agatha unravel.</p><p>Rio’s thumb lingered at the edge of lace, circling lazily, until the tension in Agatha’s body coiled so tight it nearly snapped. Then, with a slow curl of her fingers, she hooked into the waistband and began to slide the panties down. The movement was unhurried, deliberate—her knuckles brushing skin as the thin fabric was eased past Agatha’s hips, down her thighs, until it caught briefly at her knees. Rio tugged it the rest of the way with a practiced flick and let the scrap of lace fall forgotten onto the floor.</p><p>Agatha felt her whole body flush—heat radiating from her chest to the tips of her ears—not from modesty, but from the way Rio looked at her now. That steady, grounded focus of hers had sharpened into something darker, more consuming, and Agatha felt every ounce of it on her skin.</p><p>Rio’s hand returned without hesitation, fingers tracing the line of Agatha’s thigh before slipping higher, brushing over the curls of her neatly trimmed bush. Her touch was reverent, almost contemplative, as though she had all the time in the world to map the softness beneath her fingers.</p><p>She parted Agatha with slow precision, her fingertips gathering the wetness there, slick and warm. It clung, stretched between her fingers when she pulled back, and Rio’s lips curved into a grin that was half awe, half hunger. She dragged her fingers back down through the heat of it, circling deliberately, then lifting her hand just enough to watch the shine glisten in the faint light.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio murmured, her voice low, a little hoarse as she closed her lips against her digits, licking it clean. Her eyes flicked up to meet Agatha’s, heavy with desire. “You are so hot.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stutter, her whole body arching just slightly in response. She could feel the weight of her words like a touch, settling between her ribs, sparking pride and want in equal measure.</p><p>“You always say that,” Agatha managed, her voice shaky but threaded with a smirk.</p><p>“Because it’s always true,” Rio shot back without hesitation, her thumb pressing down now, a gentle but maddening pressure that made Agatha’s thighs twitch. “Every single time.”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft, broken laugh that turned quickly into a whimper when Rio’s fingers slid lower again, stroking through her with ease.</p><p>The teasing was slower now, but more devastating because of it—like Rio wanted to savor every reaction, every gasp, every tightening of Agatha’s grip in her hair.</p><p>Her chest rose and fell in sharp, uneven breaths. “You’re driving me crazy here,” she whispered, her nails grazing Rio’s scalp, tugging her closer as if proximity alone might ground her against the flood of sensation.</p><p>Rio pressed a kiss against her inner thigh, right next to the mark she’d left earlier, her fingers never pausing their steady, unhurried rhythm. “Good,” she murmured against her skin. “That’s exactly where I want you.”</p><p>Before Agatha can say anything, Rio’s teeth sank into her thigh again, sharp enough to make Agatha yelp, the sound breaking into a low whine before she could swallow it down. The sting flared and pulsed, blooming into heat that shot straight to her center. Her hips tilted instinctively, chasing pressure, grinding against the hand already working her open.</p><p>“God—” Agatha gasped, her breath catching as she arched into the touch, thighs trembling. She couldn’t stop the way her body betrayed her, seeking more, demanding more, even when Rio was taking her time.</p><p>That earned her a laugh, low and smug, vibrating against her skin as Rio mouthed lazily at the bruise she’d just created.</p><p>“Desperate already?” she teased, lips dragging over tender flesh, the smile audible in her voice.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped open, her jaw working, ready to throw back something sharp, something to claw back a little control—but before she could get the words out, Rio curled her fingers inside her just right.</p><p>The sensation stole her breath, dragged a helpless whine from her throat, raw and unguarded. Her back lifted off the mattress, her nails raking through Rio’s short hair as if clinging could save her from being unraveled so quickly.</p><p>“There it is,” Rio murmured, her tone rich with satisfaction. She pressed another kiss to the bruised skin, gentler this time, almost sweet in contrast to the sting still throbbing there. Her fingers moved with more purpose now—steady, deliberate thrusts matched with the wicked press of her thumb against Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“You love this, don’t you?” she went on, her voice dark and certain. “Walking around, parading these bruises… just so people know you’re mine.”</p><p>The words landed heavier than the bite, winding their way through Agatha’s chest until they lodged tight in her throat. She wanted to argue, to deny the smug claim—but every roll of Rio’s wrist had her thighs tightening, her hips canting helplessly into the rhythm. She could feel herself clenching hard around the fingers filling her, slick sounds betraying just how much she wanted this.</p><p>Her head tipped back, lips parting around a shaky groan. She hated how much the taunt was true, how she did love carrying Rio’s marks afterward—the faint, hidden reminders that only they knew the story of. She wanted to snap back, but all she could manage was a ragged, “Fuck, baby—”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened against her thigh, her teeth grazing once more over tender flesh as her pace quickened. Her free hand pressed firmer into Agatha’s hip, pinning her down when she tried to writhe for more. “That’s it, mi loquita” she coaxed, her voice thick with heat, her words threading into the rhythm of her hand. “Let them see how much you belong to me.”</p><p>Each thrust felt harder now, sharper, her thumb circling in perfect counterpoint, pulling broken sounds from Agatha’s lips no matter how much she tried to keep them down. Her body rocked helplessly into it, tension building with every stroke, every deliberate drag of teeth over her skin.</p><p>When Rio bit her thigh again—harder this time, just shy of cruel—the cry that tore from Agatha was raw, her hips jerking up into the fingers driving her closer and closer to the edge.</p><p>Rio’s laugh was dark and low, curling around Agatha’s nerves like smoke. She pressed another biting kiss into the soft flesh of her thigh, teeth dragging just enough to sting, and then she lifted her head to look at her—cheeks flushed, lips wet, eyes hazy.</p><p>“You know what I think?” she said, her tone dripping with smug certainty. Her fingers never slowed, sliding deeper with a curl that made Agatha jolt and choke back a sob. “I think you love this more than you love claiming me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered, her chest heaving as she tried to glare, tried to form words, but her brain was already fogged over from the relentless rhythm of Rio’s hand. All she could manage was a thin, keening whine, her hips rocking up helplessly to meet every thrust.</p><p>Rio grinned at the sound, sharp and wicked. She dipped lower to mouth over the newest bruise blooming purple on Agatha’s thigh, then whispered against it, “Yeah? You like being mine, mi amor?”</p><p>Each word punctuated with a thrust—harder now, deeper—drawing another helpless whimper from Agatha’s throat. Her thighs trembled around Rio’s shoulders, her nails scraping against the sheets in a vain attempt to ground herself.</p><p>Rio’s voice dropped further, the accent on her tongue making the words feel intimate, molten. “I bet you’d love to wear my initials around your neck…” She curled her fingers just right again, hitting that spot that made Agatha’s breath break into a cry. “…just as much as I love your hands around mine.”</p><p>The declaration landed like another bite, sharp and devastating, and Agatha couldn’t decide if she wanted to argue or beg for more. The sound she made was somewhere in between—a desperate, choked moan that left her flushed all the way to her chest.</p><p>Rio laughed softly, satisfied, and pressed her thumb firmer against her clit, dragging slow circles that made Agatha arch off the bed.</p><p>“That’s what I thought,” she murmured, eyes gleaming as she watched her Agatha unravel beneath her touch.</p><p>Rio’s thumb never faltered, the steady, deliberate circles sending shocks of heat spiraling through Agatha’s body. Each glide of pressure felt sharper, more consuming, pulling her higher and higher until her breath was breaking in ragged bursts. Her back arched off the bed, chest heaving, her fingers knotting in the sheets like she could anchor herself against the rush threatening to tear her apart.</p><p>She knew Rio could feel it—the way her thighs trembled uncontrollably around her shoulders, the way her body clenched down tight around her fingers. Rio always knew. And usually, she would take this moment to draw it out, to push Agatha further, drag her into that delicious edge of desperation until she was begging.</p><p>But Rio’s gaze locked on her, dark and unwavering, and her smile softened into something almost reverent as her voice dropped low, coaxing, intimate. “Come on, baby… let go for me.”</p><p>The words struck like a spark, undoing whatever fragile control Agatha still held. Her cry was sharp, raw, filling the room as her body snapped tight, every nerve alight with blinding pleasure. She came hard around Rio’s fingers, clenching so tight it stole her breath, her thighs locking as if she couldn’t bear to let go.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop, didn’t ease until the wave had fully ripped through her. She rode it with her, coaxing every last shudder, her thumb unrelenting until Agatha’s gasp turned into a broken whine. Only then did she slow, easing her movements, her free hand smoothing up over Agatha’s hip in grounding strokes.</p><p>“That’s it,” Rio murmured, kissing the inside of her thigh gently, just above the fresh bite mark. Her voice was a warm thread of praise, soothing the ragged edges of Agatha’s release. “So beautiful when you fall apart for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s body went slack, her breath coming in sharp, uneven pulls. She felt heavy, boneless, and yet that foggy ache in her chest—the one Rio always managed to stir—burned brighter than ever.</p><p align="center">💜🎧💚</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile when Agatha pulled her closer, kissing her hungrily, all teeth and heat and need. She would never get used to this—the way Agatha clung to her after being undone, fingers gripping like she couldn’t bear to let go, kissing her like the air in her lungs came second to having Rio’s mouth on hers.</p><p>It never failed to make Rio’s chest ache in the best way. Because it hadn’t always been like this. She remembered how careful Agatha used to be, how guarded she’d kept herself, how she had rationed her affection like it was something dangerous to hand over too freely. But now? Now she kissed like she had nothing to hide, like she wanted Rio to feel every ounce of hunger, every jagged edge of need, every greedy demand that came with loving her.</p><p>And Rio loved it. She loved how Agatha still carried that sharpness, that certainty, never shy about what she wanted, but now she asked without fear, without hesitation. It was intoxicating to be wanted like this, so openly, so fiercely.</p><p>And Rio could never not oblige.</p><p>“Take this off,” Agatha complained between kisses, her voice half a growl, half a plea as she shoved at the waistband of Rio’s jeans.</p><p>Rio laughed into her mouth, breathless, tugging them down quickly enough to prove she wasn’t about to argue. She kicked them away without grace, gasping when Agatha’s palm pressed firmly over the thin fabric of her boxers.</p><p>“And you have the audacity of talking about me,” Agatha teased, her smirk curling against Rio’s lips as her fingers flexed, pressing against the soaked patch there.</p><p>Rio’s head fell back, eyes fluttering shut, a choked laugh breaking on her tongue. “Shut up,” she managed, but the way her hips shifted into Agatha’s hand betrayed her completely.</p><p>Before Rio could catch her breath, Agatha flipped them with sudden, surprising force, her strength always a little shocking in moments like this. Rio’s back hit the mattress, and she had just enough time to suck in a sharp breath before Agatha was on her again—her mouth hot and greedy as it dragged over her jaw, down the column of her throat.</p><p>Rio watched her through heavy-lidded eyes, transfixed, her chest rising and falling fast as she felt Agatha’s lips trail lower, leaving wet, open-mouthed kisses that turned sharp with intent. Each scrape of teeth sent jolts down her spine, each pull of suction marking her skin with a possessive kind of artistry.</p><p>She knew what Agatha was doing—payback, plain and simple. Every bite, every blooming bruise was a deliberate echo of the ones Rio had left earlier, but heavier, slower, meant to linger.</p><p>Rio hissed when Agatha sucked harder just below her collarbone, her fingers tangling in her girlfriend’s hair. “Fuck,” she breathed, a broken, helpless sound, even as her lips tugged into a grin. She couldn’t tear her gaze away, watching her fierce, stubborn, impossibly beautiful girlfriend claiming her in every way that mattered. The sting, the heat, the weight of it all—it anchored her, left her trembling in the best way.</p><p>When Agatha finally leaned back, her lips were swollen and slick, a victorious glimmer in her eyes that made Rio’s stomach flip. That smug little smile only deepened as she hooked her fingers into the waistband of Rio’s boxers and tugged them down. The fabric slid off in one smooth pull, leaving Rio bare to the cool air that rushed over her overheated skin.</p><p>She gasped, body jolting with the sharp contrast, a sound half-shock, half-need tearing from her throat.</p><p>Agatha’s smirk widened as if she’d been waiting for that exact reaction. Her hands settled on Rio’s thighs, pressing them open with easy insistence before lowering herself between them.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched hard when she felt the first slow drag of Agatha’s tongue along her folds—unhurried, deliberate, starting at her entrance and gliding upward, ending with a teasing flick over her clit that made her whole body seize up. She couldn’t help the noise that slipped free, a whine so soft and desperate it made heat crawl up her chest.</p><p>Agatha hummed like she’d been rewarded, the vibration rolling against Rio’s skin, and then she pulled one of Rio’s hands down, threading it firmly into her own hair. She tilted her head just enough to look up, eyes gleaming, lips glistening.</p><p>“Use my mouth to make you feel good, baby,” Agatha said, her voice sultry and rich, curling low in Rio’s stomach. “You deserve a reward.”</p><p>Before Rio could even process the words, Agatha pressed her tongue back against her, this time with more pressure, more intent. The long, languid lick turned firmer as she circled over her clit, slow but steady, coaxing sounds from Rio that she couldn’t have held back if she tried.</p><p>Her fingers clenched instinctively in Agatha’s hair, gripping tight around the dark, unruly waves as if to ground herself. She tugged helplessly, hips twitching up into the warmth of her girlfriend’s mouth.</p><p>“Fuck—Agatha…” she groaned, her voice breaking into another whine as her head tipped back against the pillows, eyes squeezing shut. Her chest rose and fell rapidly, every nerve ending focused on the wet, perfect rhythm of Agatha’s tongue.</p><p>And Agatha—God, Agatha—smiled against her skin, lips curving wickedly as she doubled down, licking deeper, slower, savoring the way Rio unraveled for her.</p><p>Rio’s low sounds turned urgent, a string of syllables that dissolved into the mattress the moment Agatha’s mouth went back to work.</p><p>Every slow, deliberate motion Agatha made sent a line of electricity through Rio — the way she leaned, the pressure she chose, the patient way she answered and amplified every little involuntary noise. Rio’s fingers tightened in Agatha’s hair like a lifeline; her hips found any tiny advantage to press closer, to beg for more without saying it.</p><p>“Agatha—” Rio’s voice broke, the sound raw and shaky. Her hand fisted tighter in her girlfriend’s hair, pressing her down, anchoring herself because she was already so close it scared her. “Fuck, baby, mi amor… you’re—” Her words shattered into a whimper when Agatha doubled down, tongue dragging slow and deliberate, lips sealing around her with ruthless precision.</p><p>But Agatha heard it: the quick hitch, the way Rio’s voice frayed on vowels, the little syllables she reserved for private moments. She let the sound settle in her, let it make her selfish. There was a patient cruelty to how she worked now — not mean, not careless, but precise: she held Rio’s gaze when she could, watched the way her mouth opened and closed, the way her breath stuttered when Agatha hit the spot that always made her lose the line between thought and feeling.</p><p>Her hips canted forward helplessly, chasing the rhythm. “Oh my God—Agatha, por favor…” The plea cracked on her tongue, desperation curling every syllable. She wasn’t usually this undone so quickly, but with Agatha, it always felt like her body never remembered how to resist.</p><p>Her thighs quivered around her girlfriend’s shoulders, chest heaving. “Mi reina, you’re gonna kill me like this,” she gasped, eyes squeezing shut as another whine slipped free. She hated how needy it sounded—and she loved it too, because Agatha would never let her forget it.</p><p>Agatha hummed against her in response, a smug vibration that made her vision go white at the edges. Rio let out a sobbing laugh, tugging harder at her hair. “You hear me? You're gonna ruin me.”</p><p>Her breath hitched again, uneven, frantic. She clutched at the sheets with her free hand, voice tumbling fast, shameless. “Siempre me tienes así. Baby, you don’t even know—” She cut herself off with a broken moan when Agatha’s pace shifted just slightly, cruel in its perfection.</p><p>“Fuck,” she cried out, head tipping back, “I can’t—I can’t take it—” Her hips rolled helplessly, chasing the pressure, dragging Agatha closer. She was past pride now, her voice cracked wide open with need. “Please, baby, don’t stop. Please, I need you—right there, just like that—”</p><p>Every word was punctuated by sharp, frantic breaths, her body straining for release. And Agatha—smiling wickedly against her skin—gave her exactly what she begged for, relentless, steady, determined to watch her fall apart completely.</p><p>When Rio finally let go—when the tightness in her chest became something that spilled outward in a long, raw exhale—it felt less like a collapse and more like a surrender that had been asked for and freely given. Her hands slackened in Agatha’s hair, her breath shuddered, and the trembling that ran through her was loud and beautiful in the hush that followed. Agatha stayed where she was, attentive and careful: softening her touch, letting the vibration of her hum settle Rio back into her body instead of leaving her stranded at the edge.</p><p>Rio’s first words afterward were half a laugh, half a sob, and full of the endearments that had come to mean everything. “fuck… baby… eres mala,” she panted, voice thick and affectionate.</p><p>Agatha kissed the corner of Rio’s mouth and let a light smile tug at her lips. She traced lazy circles on Rio’s chest with the pad of her thumb, feeling the steady, uneven beat of a heart that preferred honesty to distance. “You are always so good,” she said, voice low. “In every stupid, gorgeous way.”</p><p>Rio reached up and pulled Agatha down into a kiss that was all gratitude, hunger, and childish delight rolled into one. “Yo también,” she whispered against Agatha’s mouth, eyes shining. “Yo también soy tuya.”</p><p>And she knew Agatha could understand what she meant.</p><p>They stayed like that for a long time: Agatha cradling Rio with hands that still felt a little marked from earlier bites, Rio clinging with an open, almost clumsy affection, repeating vows that needed no translation. Outside, the city kept moving, but inside the bedroom the world had narrowed to two steady heartbeats and the easy, urgent rhythm of people who had learned how to take and give in equal measure.</p><p>Rio kept her hand in Agatha’s hair long after the last of the tremors faded, tracing slow, affectionate patterns. “Stay,” she murmured, softer than the night, more certain than any boast.</p><p>Agatha answered with a kiss and a squeeze, the word that had become their softest armor. “Siempre.”</p><p align="center">💜🎧💚</p><p>Agatha woke with her heart racing, her nerves already buzzing like she’d been running laps in her sleep. The ceiling above her came into focus, pale light spilling through the curtains, and her chest tightened all over again as she remembered what today meant.</p><p>Meeting Rio’s family. In person.</p><p>She’d technically met her parents once—if you could even call it that—when she’d stumbled into the background of a video call, hair wild, in an old t-shirt. Rio had laughed and introduced her like it was nothing, while Agatha had stammered through a mortifying smile and waved at the screen. It hadn’t been so bad, really; Rio’s parents had been warm and kind, already so obviously in love with their daughter’s happiness.</p><p>But Benito… that was different.</p><p>She hadn’t met him yet, not once in the eight months since she and Rio had made it official. He’d been on tour, or back home in Puerto Rico, or too busy with the album to be in L.A. Now he’d been in the city for two weeks, working nonstop with Rio in the studio, and somehow their schedules had never lined up. Not once.</p><p>Until today.</p><p>And unlike his parents, Benito knew. He knew about the ghosting, the silence Agatha had forced on Rio during those messy, terrifying months when she was too scared to be honest with Rio. She didn't have any contact with him—not directly—but Agatha somehow could feel it, the quiet weight of his protectiveness pressing down on her.</p><p>Rio had reassured her more than once: <em> There are no hard feelings, mi vida. He just wants to see me happy, and you make me happy. </em> But Agatha still dreaded it. She knew what she’d done, and she knew how she’d feel if the roles were reversed.</p><p>She swallowed hard, dragging a hand over her face, then rolled onto her side.</p><p>Rio was still asleep, her hair spilling all over the pillow, her lips parted slightly as she breathed. She looked so peaceful it almost hurt. Normally, Rio was the one sneaking out of bed first, always leaving behind coffee and breakfast waiting for her by the time Agatha managed to stumble into the kitchen. But last night had stretched late—another marathon studio session with Benito—and Rio had collapsed into bed the second she got home.</p><p>She decided she’d do what Rio usually did: start the morning off right. Make breakfast, strong coffee, something that might settle her nerves before the storm of the day.</p><p>Moving carefully, she slid out of bed, tugging the hoodie tighter around her. She padded across the room, already planning pancakes, maybe eggs, something simple but warm. She had her hand on the doorknob when a voice stopped her.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>The words were thick with sleep, slurred just enough to make Agatha’s heart squeeze. She turned back and there she was—Rio, sitting up clumsily, short hair sticking in every direction, eyes barely open and a little pout on her lips. She looked impossibly soft, Agatha’s eyes lingered on the Snoopy sweatshirt her girlfriend wore, bunched up around one shoulder. A gift from her, chosen because it had made Rio laugh until she doubled over in the store.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile, walking back to the bed. She bent down, brushing Rio’s hair back before pressing a kiss to her forehead. “I’m just going to make us breakfast,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio hummed, but instead of lying back down, she looped her arms lazily around Agatha’s waist and pulled her closer.</p><p>Agatha laughed quietly, her chest swelling at the clinginess. “Baby, you should sleep a little more, I’ll be right back, okay?”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio muttered, the word petulant but softened by the curve of her smile. She buried her face briefly against Agatha’s stomach before finally letting her go.</p><p>Agatha lingered for a moment, smoothing her hand down her girlfriend’s hair, committing the image of her to memory. She’d take every ounce of this warmth with her into the kitchen, carry it like armor against the nerves gnawing at her.</p><p>Agatha padded softly out of the bedroom, the familiar creak of the floorboard by the hallway making her lips twitch with affection. She knew every sound and corner of Rio’s apartment by now—the rhythm of the place had become hers, too. She walked it with the ease of someone who belonged, someone who had slipped so seamlessly into Rio’s space that sometimes she forgot she still technically had her own apartment across the city.</p><p>But this place lingered differently in her chest. This felt like home.</p><p>Her own apartment now felt too neat, too impersonal, just a space she used more like a crash pad than anything else. Here, though—here, there was warmth. The evidence of Rio’s life was scattered everywhere, mismatched mugs in the cupboards, sheet music on the coffee table, a sweatshirt slung over the back of the couch.</p><p>And lately, Christmas decorations.</p><p>That part still made her pause.</p><p>Agatha had hated Christmas almost her whole life. The noise, the forced cheer, the messy reminders of things she didn’t have—it had always left her cold. But Rio, with her unshakable enthusiasm, had made it her mission to change Agatha’s mind the moment she found out. And though Agatha would never admit it out loud, she’d been making progress.</p><p>She smiled faintly at the thought, picturing her girlfriend dragging her from lot to lot until she found the tree, her nose pink from the chill, her eyes lit with that stubborn spark. Agatha had trailed after her for almost an hour that night, listening to her debate which branches were fullest and which trees had the best “energy.” Later, she’d sat curled up on the couch with a mug of coffee while Rio agonized over ornament themes, arguing passionately about color schemes as though the fate of the season depended on it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t care about any of it—not really. But she cared about Rio. And Rio cared enough for the both of them. So she indulged, letting herself be tugged along to tree farms and ornament aisles, and she found she didn’t mind.</p><p>She even liked it sometimes.</p><p>The one tradition she genuinely enjoyed was the movies. That was easy—safe. She’d been more than happy to curl up on Rio’s big, ridiculously comfortable couch, wrapped in a blanket while whatever Christmas classic was queued up on the screen. And inevitably, she’d fall asleep tucked against her girlfriend’s chest, lulled by the steady rise and fall of her breathing. Those moments were simple. Those moments were hers.</p><p>Agatha smiled at the memory as she waited for the coffee machine to start its low hum. She reached for the plate on the counter, snagging one of the gingerbread cookies she and Rio had decorated yesterday. She bit into it, suppressing a laugh when she remembered why they’d shoved the plate out of sight—half of them had turned out looking very suggestive on purpose.</p><p>Definitely not something to leave lying around when Rio’s parents arrived.</p><p>Her stomach twisted at the thought, the taste of ginger and spice lingering on her tongue. She closed her eyes briefly, hand braced against the counter as the machine gurgled and hissed.</p><p>Agatha balanced the tray carefully in her hands as she walked back down the short hallway, the smell of coffee and warm toast curling into the air. The mugs clinked softly with each step, a reminder of how much she’d grown used to this.</p><p>She nudged the bedroom door open with her hip, and Rio was still sprawled across the bed, half tangled in the sheets, hair sticking up in wild angles, eyes heavy-lidded but waiting.</p><p>The second she noticed Agatha, Rio’s hands lifted in the air in a dramatic gesture—grabby and impatient.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help it; she shook her head, amusement tugging at her lips. “You’re impossible,” she murmured, setting the tray carefully down on the bedside table. But despite the mock disapproval, she climbed back into bed, and the moment she did, Rio rolled toward her with unhurried determination, arms winding around her waist.</p><p>She tucked her face against Agatha’s neck, warm breath ghosting over her skin. “You said you would be right back,” she mumbled, her voice scratchy with sleep.</p><p>Agatha could practically feel the pout pressed against her throat. She laughed softly, carding a hand through her girlfriend’s messy hair. “I was gone for less than thirty minutes, baby.”</p><p>“Too long,” Rio hummed, as though that settled the matter.</p><p>Agatha smiled, her chest tight with affection. She wrapped her arms around her, holding her closer, letting the weight of Rio against her ground her in a way nothing else could.</p><p>For a moment she thought she had drifted back to sleep—the steady breathing, the utter stillness. But then Rio shifted, lifting her head just enough to brush the faintest kiss against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Thanks for making breakfast, mi vida,” she whispered, her eyes still soft with sleep but her smile brightening.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, brushing her thumb over Rio’s cheek. “This hardly constitutes as making breakfast, but you’re welcome.” She tilted her head slightly, curiosity creeping into her tone. “So, what’s our game plan for today? What time are you picking your parents up at the airport?”</p><p>Rio sighed against her neck before finally lifting her head, hair a wild halo that made Agatha smile despite the tightness still lingering in her chest. “Their flight gets in around one,” she murmured, voice a little clearer now. “I’m gonna drive over and pick them up. Benito’s not coming with me, though—he said he has to record something this afternoon, so he’ll come by later to help set things up.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, tracing idle patterns over the back of Rio’s sweatshirt. “Do you want me to come with you?” she offered, even though her stomach flipped at the thought. Meeting her parents in person after all this time—it felt heavier than a simple airport pickup.</p><p>Rio’s lips curved softly, the kind of smile that was meant to soothe. “Mi vida, would you mind staying here instead? Benito and I ordered from Don Julio’s—you know, that boricua spot we always argue over because you and I pick too much mofongo.” Her laugh was soft and fond. “Could you stay and grab it when they deliver? I’m not sure if I will make it back here before they get here”</p><p>Agatha blinked, it felt oddly comforting that Rio and Benito had thought this through.</p><p>“Of course,” she said, and couldn’t help the teasing edge that slipped in. “It’ll be my honor to spare your parents from my three-ingredient pasta.” The joke was ridiculous, theatrical—Agatha had always been theatrically bad at cooking when she let herself be—but Rio’s laugh was immediate and bright, making the room warm in a way coffee never did.</p><p>“You’re the best,” Rio murmured, and for a second she looked almost guilty for asking, as if she knew she was handing Agatha both a favor and a small test. She threaded her fingers through Agatha’s and squeezed. “I know you're worried about Benito. I’ll text him. Tell him not to be an asshole today, okay?”</p><p>The corners of her mouth tipped up into a grin that was more reassurance than threat.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. The knot in her stomach loosened a few degrees—enough that she could laugh with Rio instead of at herself.</p><p>“Deal,” she said. “And fine—if he’s rude, I’ll—” She stopped, because there was nothing clever to say that sounded true. Instead she kissed the side of Rio’s neck, soft and solid. “I’ll hold down the fort.”</p><p>They ate the rest of their breakfast slow, the place between them quiet and attentive. Rio dozed once or twice with her head against Agatha’s collarbone, a hand still tucked into the back of her hoodie, and Agatha found the rhythm of her breathing oddly calming. She imagined the coming hours—the airport, the polite smiles, the small talk—and the fear was still there, but smaller somehow, dulled by the fact that they’d planned this together. When Rio pushed her hair out of her face and kissed her, it was a simple, grounding motion, and Agatha felt steadier.</p><p>By the time Rio got ready to go, Agatha followed her to the door. “Be careful, transit will probably be bad” she called after her.</p><p>Rio turned at the door, one last grin, and mouthed. “I love you”</p><p>It landed like a warm coin in Agatha’s chest.”I love you too, now go before you get late” she said, giving her girlfriend a quick kiss.</p><p>Alone for a moment, Agatha padded into the kitchen to tidy the tray, she could worry about the rest later. For now, she made another pot of coffee and let the quiet unknot her a little more.</p><p align="center">💜🎧💚</p><p>Rio bit her lip, her leg bouncing restlessly against the plastic chair as she sat near the gate at LAX. The arrivals screen glowed above her, announcing the flight from San Juan had landed, and every time the glass doors slid open, her stomach flipped. She’d been rehearsing this moment for days, though she knew it was silly—she wasn’t the one meeting someone new tonight. But still, she wanted it all to be perfect. Agatha was nervous enough about meeting her family, and Rio wanted to soften every edge of the day before they all ended up together under one roof.</p><p>And then—there they were. She saw her father, tall and steady as ever, rolling one suitcase with another balanced on top, and her mother right beside him, scanning the crowd until her eyes landed on Rio.</p><p>“¡Mami! ¡Papi!” Rio’s voice carried over the noise, bright and unrestrained. She bolted up from her chair, weaving past a family reuniting, and practically threw herself into her mother’s arms.</p><p>“¡Mi nena!” Isabel exclaimed, kissing her cheek twice, then pulling back to frame her daughter’s face in her hands. “Mírate, bendito. ¡Qué flaquita estás! ¿Estás comiendo bien?”</p><p>“Mami…” Rio groaned but hugged her tightly again, laughing. “Claro que sí. No empieces.”</p><p>Carlos chuckled, handing off one of the bags to her free hand. “Déjala, Isa. Mira qué contenta está de vernos.” He pulled Rio into his own hug, solid and warm. “Qué mucha falta hiciste, mi amor. Too much time.”</p><p>“Always too much,” Rio admitted, voice thick for a moment. Then she stepped back, juggling one of the suitcases. “Come on, let’s get you to the car. Flight was long, right?”</p><p>“So long,” Isabel sighed, adjusting her purse on her shoulder. “But we’re here now. Eso es lo que importa.”</p><p>From there, the conversation flowed easily. She caught them up quickly as they made their way through the terminal: the drive to LAX that morning, Benito being buried in her studio, the rush of holiday preparations she was still pretending to be on top of. By the time they stepped out into the brisk LA air and reached her car, the chatter was quick and layered, her parents chiming in, asking questions, laughing in disbelief at how fast the year had gone.</p><p>Inside the car, once the luggage was loaded and Isabel had claimed the passenger seat while Carlos settled in back, Rio finally let herself exhale. She pulled out of the lot, fingers drumming against the steering wheel.</p><p>“So Benito really wanted to be here to meet you, but he’s recording an interview or something this afternoon. We’ve been working like crazy on the album—three tracks already, and I swear he’s pushing me harder than ever. But it’s good. It’s really good.”</p><p>Carlos leaned forward slightly, a smile tugging at his mouth. “That’s why you two are making us come to LA instead of flying home? He’s taking this one seriously.”</p><p>Rio laughed at her father teasing, glancing at them before turning onto the freeway.</p><p>“It feels different this time. Focused. But he told me to make sure you knew he’ll see you tonight though.”</p><p>Isabel shifted in her seat to look at her. “Y tu novia? Where is she?”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved without her meaning to. “Agatha's at my place, waiting for the food delivery. Benito and I ordered from the Boricua spot we love so we wouldn’t have to stress about cooking. Figured it was better that way, everyone relaxed and fed. And honestly…” She smirked a little. “It also spares you from Agatha trying to cook. She’s amazing at a lot of things, but not that.”</p><p>Her mom’s laugh was soft but genuine. “She sounds smart already, knowing her limits.”</p><p>Rio grinned wider, stealing a glance at her father in the rearview mirror. He was watching her with a faintly amused expression, one brow arched.</p><p>“What?” she asked.</p><p>“Nothing,” Carlos said, though his voice was warm. “Just… you smile a lot when you talk about her. That tells me plenty.”</p><p>Heat crept up Rio’s cheeks, but she didn’t bother hiding it. Instead, she adjusted the volume on the radio, letting a soft melody fill the space. Isabel reached across the console to squeeze her hand, and Rio let her, grounding herself in the quiet intimacy of the moment.</p><p>The rest of the drive to the hotel unfolded in the same easy rhythm—catching up on family back in San Juan, her parents commenting on how different LA felt since the last time they left their island to visit her, and Rio weaving in updates about the studio, her routines, and little details of her life. When her parents asked again about Agatha, it was without pressure, just the curiosity of people who had already pieced together so much through their daughter’s phone calls.</p><p>Rio knew she wasn’t subtle. She’d catch herself talking about Agatha without even realizing it—about how she hogged her hoodies, how she laughed until she cried at the dumbest movies, how she’d fallen asleep halfway through reading a book last week, head tucked into Rio’s lap. She’d told her mom about the time Agatha stayed up with her until dawn at the studio, just to make sure she didn’t burn herself out. She’d told her dad about how Agatha had been developing a love for plants since she started hanging around Rio’s apartment.</p><p>Now, as the city stretched wide around them, Isabel and Carlos shared a look between them—subtle, but full of meaning. They already knew this woman mattered deeply. Tonight wasn’t about finding that out; it was about finally seeing the face behind the name, the voice behind the stories, the person who had already carved her way into Rio’s heart.</p><p>When they finally pulled up to the hotel, Isabel reached over to squeeze her hand again before getting out. “Tonight will be good, mi nena,” she said simply, with the calm certainty only a mother could give.</p><p>Rio nodded, her heart thudding at the thought. She wanted to believe that too. Tonight, everyone that mattered to her would finally be in the same room.</p><p align="center">💜🎧💚</p><p>Agatha was halfway through dusting Rio’s huge monstera plant—the one that took up nearly half the corner by the window and made her feel like she was living in a greenhouse—when the sharp chime of the doorbell cut through the apartment. She startled, nearly dropping the cloth, and muttered under her breath as she shoved her feet into the nearest pair of slippers.</p><p>“Coming!” she called, padding across the floor, smoothing down her hoodie like she was about to face an inspection. She tugged the door open, expecting maybe the delivery driver.</p><p>But instead, she froze.</p><p>On the other side of the doorway stood Benito, animatedly gesturing with one hand while speaking rapid Spanish to a girl who seemed to be in her mid 20s. He balanced several takeout bags in the crook of his arm, while the girl carried a wide cardboard tray with drinks carefully balanced inside.</p><p>“Oh, hi,” Agatha blurted, her voice awkwardly pitched higher than she meant.</p><p>Benito’s demeanor shifted instantly. The wide, warm grin he’d worn while speaking to the girl softened into something more measured as his eyes flicked to Agatha. She had to force herself not to flinch at the change, suddenly hyperaware of how tense the air between them felt.</p><p>“Rio texted me saying she was on her way back and I met Gabi struggling with these, so I helped her,” he explained smoothly, holding up the bags like proof.</p><p>Agatha nodded quickly, fingers tightening around the doorframe. “Right. Of course. Thanks.”</p><p>She stepped aside, pushing the door wider, and automatically reached to relieve the girl—Gabi—of her burden. But she shook her head, smiling politely.</p><p>“Where should I put these?” she asked.</p><p>“The kitchen is fine, it’s—” Agatha began, gesturing vaguely down the hall.</p><p>“Yo sé dónde queda, ven conmigo, baby,” Benito cut in, his words smooth, rolling off his tongue with the familiar music of his accent.</p><p>Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown by the sudden pet name, by the casual confidence with which he said it. Her brows furrowed slightly, but she didn’t comment, simply stepping back as he and Gabi moved past her.</p><p>The muffled sound of their footsteps and Benito’s low voice drifted from the kitchen while Agatha stood rooted in the living room, arms crossed, trying to untangle the flicker of confusion running through her chest. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, glancing toward the door as if wishing Rio would walk through it right then, saving her from the strange heaviness pressing into the space.</p><p>A few minutes later, Benito reemerged with the girl in tow, the bags now tucked neatly on the counter. Gabi offered Agatha another polite smile, her tray now empty.</p><p>“All set,” she said gently, giving a small wave before slipping out the door.</p><p>The lock clicked behind her, and silence folded itself over the apartment. Agatha suddenly became hyperaware of the faint hum of the refrigerator, the tick of the clock on the wall, the soft rustle of fabric when Benito moved. For the first time all day, the apartment—Rio’s apartment, the one that always felt too full of warmth and life—felt oppressively small.</p><p>“So…” she began, her voice coming out thinner than she wanted. She cleared her throat and tried again, forcing her hands to still in her lap. “So, how did the recording go?”</p><p>Benito stood there for a beat, studying her with an expression that made her spine tighten. It wasn’t openly hostile, but it was guarded, measured, like he was deciding whether or not to bother answering her. Then, without a word, he walked over and dropped onto the armchair across from where she sat on the couch. His body language was relaxed, but his eyes—those sharp, assessing eyes so much like Rio’s when she was being serious—never wavered.</p><p>m“It was okay,” he finally said, his voice low, even. “I was recording something I want to use for one of the music videos.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, leaning forward slightly, glad for the neutral ground. “Oh, that’s nice. Sounds exciting.” And she meant it—she really did. But Benito didn’t smile. He didn’t nod. He just sat there, watching her like he was trying to read a page she hadn’t meant to leave open.</p><p>The silence stretched again, heavy and uncomfortable, until Agatha let out a slow breath and sank back against the couch. She rubbed her palms against her thighs, forcing herself to meet his gaze. “Listen,” she said quietly, her voice steadier now, though her chest was tight. “I know you’re worried about your sister. I get it. And I know I’m probably the last person you wanted to see standing here, pretending like I belong. But I swear—I swear to you—I have no intention of fucking this up again.”</p><p>Her words landed between them like stones, the truth of them raw in the air. She didn’t break his gaze, even though every part of her wanted to. Instead, she sat there in the charged silence, waiting, bracing herself for whatever he might say next.</p><p>The silence thickened until Benito finally leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, fingers laced loosely together. His eyes didn’t leave hers, and when he spoke, his tone was even, but there was a sharpness underneath, the kind that came from care more than anger.</p><p>“My sister is my favorite person in the world,” he said, each word deliberate. “And I saw how hurt she was. You can’t blame me for feeling a little skeptical here.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, but she nodded, holding his gaze. “I don’t blame you. I was… I was awful to her back then. I know that. And if I could take it back, I would. But all I can do now is make sure it never happens again.”</p><p>Benito’s mouth pressed into a line. He leaned back in the chair, his eyes narrowing like he was trying to weigh her words against everything he remembered from before.</p><p>“You have to understand,” he said after a long pause, “when she called me crying, when she couldn’t even finish sentences because she was so wrecked over you, it—” He stopped, running a hand over his face. “It killed me. I don’t ever want to see her like that again.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest ached, guilt surging up like it was happening all over again. She clasped her hands together, gripping tight to keep her voice steady. “You won’t. I know I don’t deserve your trust right away, but I swear I’m not going anywhere. Not now. Not ever. If she wants me here. She… she’s it for me.”</p><p>Benito let out a slow breath, his eyes flicking down for a moment before returning to hers.</p><p>The sharpness had softened, though not entirely gone. “She’s happier now,” he admitted, almost grudgingly. “I can see it. Even over the phone, before this trip, I could hear it in her voice. And that doesn’t happen easily with her.”</p><p>A small smile tugged at Agatha’s lips, though her chest was still heavy. “She makes me happy too. More than I thought I deserved. I’m intend to hurt her, Benito. I promise you that.”</p><p>For the first time, his shoulders eased, just a fraction. He nodded once, slow, like he was allowing himself to believe her—or at least beginning to. “Good,” he said finally. “Because if you do, I won’t just sit back and watch again.”</p><p>Agatha almost laughed, though it came out as a shaky exhale instead. “Fair enough.”</p><p>The moment held between them, not exactly friendly but no longer hostile, the weight of it lingering in the air. And then, just as the quiet threatened to settle again, the sound of a key turning in the lock cut through the tension.</p><p>The moment the door opened, the air shifted.</p><p>“Cariño, I’m back—” Rio’s voice carried into the living room as she nudged the door shut with her hip, a bag of groceries in her arm.</p><p>She froze mid-step when she saw Benito slouched in the armchair, arms crossed, and Agatha sitting stiffly on the couch across from him. Her brows shot up. “Bueno… esto sí que no me lo esperaba.”</p><p>Benito’s smirk appeared instantly. “Ya era hora, hermanita. You’ve been hiding her from me.”</p><p>Rio let out a sharp laugh as she set the groceries on the counter. “Hiding from you? Please, you're the one who seems to always be conveniently busy”</p><p>“Busy working,” Benito shot back with a shrug. “Somebody’s gotta carry this album.”</p><p>“¡Ay, bendito!” Rio clutched her chest, mock-offended as she kicked off her shoes. “If anyone’s carrying, it’s me. Tú lo único que haces es cantar y ponerte guapo pa’ la cámara.”</p><p>Benito grinned, leaning against the armchair like he owned the place. “Y lo hago mejor que tú. Admitelo.”</p><p>Rio barked out a laugh, rolling her eyes as she crossed the room and dropped onto the couch beside Agatha, immediately tangling their hands together. She kissed Agatha’s temple, then looked at her brother with a smirk. “You see this? He’s impossible. Imposible.”</p><p>“Don’t listen to her,” Benito said, switching easily back to Spanish. “Ella no puede vivir sin mí.”</p><p>“¡Cállate!” Rio shot back, laughing as she leaned against Agatha’s shoulder. “Tú no sirves pa’ nada.”</p><p>Benito raised his brows, feigning offense. “Sin mí no tienes disco, hermanita. Recuerda eso.”</p><p>Rio groaned into her free hand, but the edges of her mouth curved up. “Sin mí no tienes dirección. Yo soy la productora, acuérdate tú.”</p><p>“Touché,” Benito muttered, though his grin said he didn’t mind conceding that round.</p><p>Agatha chuckled nervously, squeezing Rio’s hand. The warmth in the banter was obvious, the kind that came from years of fighting and making up, of knowing exactly which buttons to push. For a moment, the heaviness in the room dissolved into something lighter.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, narrowing her eyes at her brother. “So… did you behave while I was gone?”</p><p>Benito’s gaze slid toward Agatha, then back to his sister. “Más o menos.”</p><p>“That doesn’t sound reassuring,” Rio said suspiciously.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, managing a small smile. “It was fine.”</p><p>“Fine,” Benito echoed, deliberately smug.</p><p>Rio groaned. “Ay, Dios mío. I leave you two alone for half an hour and it’s already a telenovela.”</p><p>“Tranquila, hermanita,” Benito teased, smirk widening. “No la asusté. Todavía.”</p><p>Rio threw a cushion at him. “Cabrón.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, tension unwinding in her chest as the siblings’ familiar rhythm filled the space, playful and sharp-edged but threaded with love. It wasn’t perfect, but it was a start.</p><p align="center">💜🎧💚</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorframe for a second, watching Agatha in front of the mirror. The way her girlfriend leaned in close, steady hands finishing the careful line of lipstick—it made Rio’s chest feel tight in the best way. She grinned before the words even left her mouth.</p><p>“Nice sweater,” she said, smirking at how Agatha’s lips curved instantly.</p><p>That black-and-white sweater had been hers once, but by now, Rio knew better than to argue. If Agatha wore it, it belonged to both of them.</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha said, and Rio walked over, sliding her arms around her from behind. Her chin fit perfectly against Agatha’s shoulder as she caught their reflection in the mirror.</p><p>They looked good together.</p><p>“We’re kinda matching,” Rio pointed out, eyes flicking between her outfit with her own black and white pants and the one Agatha wore.</p><p>“Yeah, we are.”</p><p>Rio smiled at that, but her attention didn’t waver from Agatha’s expression. She was calm on the surface, but Rio noticed the little giveaways: the quick exhale, the way her shoulders tightened the closer the evening came.</p><p>“You left your brother alone?” Agatha asked, voice lighter than her eyes.</p><p>“Nah,” Rio said. “He insisted on picking up Mami and Papi himself. Wanted the first hug of the night.” She chuckled softly, squeezing Agatha’s waist. “You saw how he is.”</p><p>The smile on Agatha’s face lingered, but Rio could feel the tension thrumming underneath. She tightened her hold just a little. “You’re nervous,” she said gently. Not a question.</p><p>Agatha let out a small laugh, but Rio could hear the truth in it. She didn’t need her to admit it—she already knew. And so she leaned in, her voice softer, lower, meant for Agatha’s ears alone.</p><p>“It’s gonna be fine, mi amor. Mami and Papi already love you, even if they don’t know you yet. And Benito—” Rio smirked, shaking her head— “you handled him. That’s saying something.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha’s reflection shifted, some of that edge easing away, replaced with a half-smile that was real this time. God, she was beautiful like this—unguarded.</p><p>“They’ll see what I see,” Rio added, pressing closer. “How could they not?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, and Rio didn’t wait another second. She turned Agatha around and leaned in, kissing her, tasting the fresh sweetness of lipstick against her lips. She hadn’t meant to ruin the careful work, but once Agatha kissed her back, she didn’t care. She smiled against her mouth, unwilling to pull away until she had to.</p><p>When she finally pulled back, Rio laughed softly, making Agatha turn. The sight in the mirror was purple smudges across both their lips, the careful edges of Agatha’s makeup completely ruined in seconds.</p><p>“Worth it,” Rio murmured, leaning in to press one more kiss to her cheek just to prove she meant it.</p><p>Agatha groaned, grabbing tissues from the counter with mock exasperation, muttering something under her breath as she tried to salvage her work. Rio only grinned wider, propping her chin on Agatha’s shoulder to watch. Even nervous, even flustered—maybe especially then—she was everything Rio wanted.</p><p>By the time the knock on the door finally came, both of them were ready, side by side, a little flushed from laughing while fixing the lipstick disaster. Rio felt a rush of relief as she let her parents in, happy she didn’t have to worry about anything else tonight. This wasn’t the big Christmas party, that would come later that week, with friends and noise and chaos.</p><p>She’d planned this evening deliberately, a quieter gathering before the real whirlwind of the holidays, because she knew how easily Agatha could get overwhelmed. Tonight was about family only.</p><p>Carlos and Isabel stepped inside, bringing with them the faint chill of the evening and the unmistakable warmth that came whenever they entered a room. Her mother was the first to spot Agatha, her face lighting up immediately as she crossed the space with open arms.</p><p>“So, you're Agatha,” she said warmly. “¡Qué bella! Mucho gusto, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha froze for just half a heartbeat before recovering, returning the embrace with a shy smile. “It’s so nice to finally meet you,” she said, her voice soft but sincere.</p><p>Carlos followed with his steadier, quieter presence, but his hug was no less genuine. He clapped Agatha gently on the back, then pulled away with a smile that reached his eyes. “Bienvenida a la familia. Rio talks a lot about you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart swelled so fast it almost hurt. Seeing her parents greet Agatha not just politely, but with open affection, melted something inside her. She hovered for a moment, just soaking it in—the way her mother’s hands rested reassuringly on Agatha’s arm, the way her father’s smile lingered.</p><p>Even Benito, who’d been leaning against the doorway pretending to scroll through his phone, behaved better than Rio expected. He offered Agatha a small nod, almost neutral, but the sharpness he’d carried earlier was gone. Rio suspected that had more to do with their parents’ presence than with Agatha herself, but she wasn’t going to complain. It was still progress.</p><p>Everyone settled into the living room with plates of food, voices overlapping in a soft, familiar rhythm. Isabel asked Agatha questions with genuine curiosity, Carlos chimed in with his classic dad humor, and even Benito offered the occasional comment. Rio sat back for a moment, her chest tight but full, watching the scene unfold.</p><p>This was all she had wanted—for Agatha to feel at home with them, for her family to embrace the person who had become her anchor. And sitting there, watching laughter bloom easily across the room, Rio felt certain: this was exactly how it was meant to be.</p><p>Rio let that feeling carry her through the whole night like a tide she didn’t want to swim against. Every time she glanced around the living room, she found something else to hold close: Benito loosening up, laughing despite himself at one of Agatha’s dry little jokes; her parents leaning forward in delight as Agatha spoke, their warmth pouring over her in waves.</p><p>At one point, Isabel launched into a story about how Rio and Benito used to fight over the remote as kids, reenacting the ridiculous shouting matches. Benito groaned and buried his face in his hands while Agatha laughed so hard she nearly dropped her fork. When Carlos chimed in with another story about Benito once trying to dye Rio’s hair with food coloring, Benito threw a pillow across the couch in protest.</p><p>Agatha’s laughter was rich and easy, her eyes sparkling, and Benito—against all odds—grinned back, shaking his head. “I don’t know why you’re laughing, cutie,” he muttered, “you’re next on their list of embarrassing stories.” Agatha only shrugged, clearly delighted.</p><p>Rio pretended to cringe at her parents’ relentless storytelling, but underneath the act, her chest felt impossibly full. This was what she wanted. Not just polite greetings, not just formal approval—she wanted this: her worlds colliding and blending together, soft and imperfect and real.</p><p>The real weight of it, though, hit her much later, when the night had wound down and they were finally back in bed. The quiet of the room wrapped around them, the faint hum of the city beyond the window their only witness. Agatha was already curled against her, her hair falling loose against Rio’s arm.</p><p>“Thanks for tonight,” Rio whispered into the dimness, her voice soft, tender. She stroked Agatha’s hair slowly, as if anchoring herself. “I’m really happy you finally got a chance to meet my parents.”</p><p>Agatha shifted, tilting her face up slightly, her voice hushed but steady. “Thank <em> you </em>. I know how much you love them, and I’m really glad I got to meet them and… and be part of your little family, even if just for the night.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened. She pulled Agatha gently upward, until their eyes met in the half-dark. “Agatha,” she said firmly, her voice breaking just a little around the edges, “I hope you know this isn’t just for tonight. You are my family, just as much as them now. And I promise you—my dad wasn’t kidding when he welcomed you. Neither was my mom. They meant it.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, her breath catching. For a moment, Rio saw that flicker of disbelief, that deep-rooted fear of not belonging. She brushed her thumb along Agatha’s cheek and pressed a kiss to her temple. “You’re not just visiting my life,” she whispered. “You’re part of it. You’re in it. With me.”</p><p>Agatha blinked quickly, her eyes shining, her hand tightening at Rio’s waist as though holding on for dear life. The emotion in her face was raw and unguarded, and Rio’s heart ached with the weight of it.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio soothed, her voice barely more than a murmur. “Don’t cry, amor. It’s okay. We’ve already changed so much since we met. And I want more. I want to keep building my life with you.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky laugh, wiping at her eyes before burrowing closer into Rio’s chest. “I want that too,” she whispered.</p><p>And there, tangled together in the quiet, with the night pressing softly around them, Rio felt it settle inside her—how much had shifted between them, how much more there was to grow into. She held Agatha close, steady and unyielding, and as they drifted toward sleep, one truth sang louder than anything else: this was only the beginning.</p><p align="center">💚⚡️💜</p>
