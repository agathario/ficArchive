<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I cannot <u>believe</u> you talked me into this."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, Agatha, chill! It's one night out. Cheap drinks, good music..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sure, Jen. Good music. The last time we came to this place was a live night, and the headliner was a fucking Alison Blaire impersonator!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"That was four years ago. They've changed things up a lot. Come on."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha allowed Jen to drag her along as they waited to get into the club. She would rather be anywhere but here, at a club she had last entered when she was still technically two weeks under drinking age. Still, it had been a long time since she had a good night out. She was not counting Wanda's bachelorette party because, while there had certainly been good drinks and wild drama that night, it had really ended up mostly being upsetting in the final analysis.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">At least the wedding the next week had been worth it.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The club, once they were inside, was packed pretty full, the smell of too many cheap perfumes and colognes blanketing everything. Agatha and Jen managed to wade their way through the crowd to the bar and order, then turned to survey the dance floor.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thought you said there was a DJ tonight," Agatha said, nodding to the empty booth.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Jen scoffed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"People take breaks, Agatha. At least there's still music playing."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha distracted herself with drinking her gin and tonic as slowly as possible while fighting the urge to bob her head along to any of the music. Just about the time Jen was getting well into her second Manhattan, Agatha had barely made a dent in that first G&amp;T, and further progress was momentarily halted when a voice boomed out over the club's sound system.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"HEY, HOW WE ALL DOING TONIGHT?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Glancing over to the DJ booth, Agatha saw that it was now occupied by a figure with wild dark hair, eyes shielded behind dark glasses, torso shrouded in an enormous puffy coat.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, hey, it's Rio!" Jen said, leaning close to Agatha as the next set started.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yup! Regular DJ down here every other Friday and Saturday!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then Jen got distracted by something down at the other end of the bar and sort of wandered off, leaving Agatha all on her own.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Still nursing that first drink, Agatha shrugged and started to ease her way along to be closer to the booth. She wanted to see this DJ a little closer. There was something almost intriguing about this... Well, she presumed guy. Not that women could not be DJs and shit, of course, but there was something about Rio, who had now shrugged off the big jacket, that screamed "twink." Agatha had no interest in men, but she had discovered at some point that she had a social affinity for twinks. They were adorable, generally unimposing, and most of the ones she knew were almost as bitchy as she was. Of course, no group was a monolith, but still, this Rio seemed interesting.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The closer she got, the more entranced Agatha felt.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr"><em>'Oh, fuck,'</em> she thought, <em>'please don't let </em><u><em>this</em></u><em> be how I find out I have a 0.0002% attraction to guys.'</em></p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio had a soft, almost babyish face—at least what was not hidden by the glasses—and a slim, almost wiry build. Agatha could see, thanks to the DJ being clad in a mostly unbuttoned white button down, something like a hint of delicate muscle definition around the chest and abs, and as she got to the side of the booth, peering up the steps that led into it, she saw that Rio's legs were encased in dark leather trousers, so tight fitting that she was certain she saw a noticeable bulge. Of course, the only bulge Agatha <u>might</u> hypothetically be interested in was one caused by a packer, but still...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr"><em>'Fuck, was my drink spiked?'</em></p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">How was she feeling attraction to a guy? She had never experienced anything like this. Something about Rio was simply magnetic.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then, Rio looked down at Agatha. And then, Rio smiled, a cocky, bright grin with a small gap between the top front teeth.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Shit," Agatha breathed, and downed the remainder of her drink in one gulp.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Heading back the way she had gone, Agatha caught a bartender's attention and ordered a second drink. Farther down the way she saw Jen, deep in conversation with a cute, punk-looking girl. Good for Jen.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For a while, Agatha purely kept herself occupied with her second drink and her phone, desperate not to look at the confusing DJ. At some point after an hour and a half had passed, she heard Rio speak over the mic again, but still she kept her head down, pretending to find a recipe for lobster bisque—she had searched for the most random thing she could—shatteringly fascinating.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hi!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Glancing to her right, Agatha nodded briefly, then did a double take.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">That wild hair. Those dark glasses. That cute, cocky grin.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh," Agatha managed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I never seen you around here before!" Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... I don't come out often."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Huh‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I said I don't come out often!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ah! Well, kinda ironic you're at a gay club then, huh‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The comment took a moment to land, but then it hit. Agatha laughed and, to her mortification, snorted. She immediately felt herself blush, and she looked down at her drink.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm Rio!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, uh, I'm... I'm Agatha!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nice to meet you, Agatha!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio was offering a hand, and without really thinking, Agatha turned and tried to shake... But handed Rio her half-finished drink instead. Rio laughed, a raucous, warm sound.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I already get free drinks, but thanks!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Oh shit, I'm..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hey, it's okay!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Taking her drink back, Agatha nearly finished it and decided she should make a quick, face-saving exit.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Uhm, I need..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You want another drink‽ I can get it for you free!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, thanks! This was my second! Hit my limit!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool, cool! So, you don't come to places like this a lot‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not in years!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Too bad! We get pretty heavy here! You seem like the kinda girl who'd enjoy it!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Well, I... I'm busy a lot!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I get that!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio waved down the bartender and asked for a bottle of water. Once it arrived, the bottle was chugged to emptiness in seconds, and then Rio grinned at Agatha again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You likin' my show‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're great! I mean, your mixes..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha studied Rio, trying to parse the vague androgyny of this person. Her eyes wandered up and down, but still she was uncertain of things.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, since you're here, are you..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Lesbian!" Agatha rushed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool! Me too!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Oh, thank God! Agatha felt a little more certain about her intrigue now. When Rio leaned in close, the world seemed to slow down.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, I got a little time before my next set! You wanna... Maybe hang out‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No pressure! Just thought, you're hot as hell and I... Well, I mean, if you wanna..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I mean, I won't... I... Is this..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's whatever you want it to be!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Glancing at her phone, Agatha felt heat begin to pool between her legs.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"How much time do you have‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Enough to make you see stars," Rio smirked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Shit. Fuck. Was she seriously thinking of hooking up with someone she just met? That was so irresponsible, so silly, so...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Meet me in the bathroom! Five minutes!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed and gave Agatha a little salute.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"As you wish!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Finishing the drink in her hand, Agatha tucked her phone into her clutch and eased past Rio, headed for the bathrooms. This was perhaps the dumbest thing she had ever done, but fuck it. She was young. She deserved a little irresponsible fun now and then, right? At worst this would be just a very awkward hook-up.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The bathroom was surprisingly empty as she entered, and Agatha was grateful for that. Checking herself in the mirror, she saw that she was a little flushed, and her lipstick could use a touch-up, but otherwise she was presentable. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and went into the third stall after a quick inspection showed it to be reasonably clean. She tore off some strips of toilet paper and arrayed them on the seat, then sat to wait. She was nervous that Rio would not bother to show up, but a few minutes later, she heard the bathroom door open and close, followed by the scuff and stomp of motorcycle boots.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>¿Ágata, estás aquí?</em>"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Ah, so Rio spoke Spanish. That was one more way to connect.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Sí,</em>" Agatha said softly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio's boots stopped in front of the third stall, and then the door swung slowly open.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You speak Spanish?" the DJ asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"And a couple of other languages. I teach adult ESL courses at the community college."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No shit. That's pretty great."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio stepped into the stall, closing and latching the door. Suddenly Agatha felt very nervous, and it must have showed, because Rio smiled and reached down to stroke her cheek.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You really want this? If you don't..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I do, I just... It's been a while since I did anything."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. You wanna just go back out and talk by the bar?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Standing, Agatha slipped her arms around Rio's neck.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just kiss me first?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Course I will. Of course."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio's lips were soft, and Agatha wondered as they met her own how they might feel on other parts of her body. She groaned, and Rio responded in kind, eagerly deepening the kiss.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Damn," Rio whispered when they parted.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can you... Can we go for a repeat?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah, definitely."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The second kiss ended when Rio turned them slightly and backed Agatha up against the partition with the second stall.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, babe, you're hot," Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha blushed, looking away until Rio cupped her chin gently and drew her back eye to eye.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I mean it. You're fuckin' hot, Agatha."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're pretty fuckin' hot yourself."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I get that a lot."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">With a smirk, Rio slid one hand down from Agatha's waist and fiddled with the hem of the purple minidress that Agatha had deemed the perfect look for tonight.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Want me?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded and whimpered and oh, if she had been fully cognizant of that noise as it left her throat, of the neediness of it, she would have been embarrassed as hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio kissed her again, softly, and nuzzled their noses together a moment.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, you look so pretty when you're desperate for me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Touch me?" was all Agatha could think to say.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She felt Rio's fingers, firm and warm, brush the bare skin of her inner thigh. They slid up, almost daring to press against Agatha's panties, but then the movement stopped.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, babe, you're so wet you're dripping. Fuck."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha drew in a shuddery gasp as Rio kissed her once more, at the same time bringing the fingers all the way up to press firmly against the satiny material of her panties.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ready for me, yeah?" Rio rasped, rubbing back and forth along the crotch of the panties.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please," Agatha begged, but her words cut off as Rio's fingers pushed her underwear to the side.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Pretty pussy all wet for me, huh?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please, Rio, I need it."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? You gonna take everything I got to give?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck yes!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Two of Rio's fingers slid in, smooth and easy, and then they scissored apart. Agatha groaned at the slight stretch, and Rio grinned. Slowly, achingly slowly, the fingers began to ease out, then slid back in rapidly. That was the pace at first: slow, careful, almost total withdrawal, then a quick slam back in. After a few minutes, all the movements picked up speed. Agatha was vaguely aware of the obscene wet sounds that the action made, as well as the scent of her arousal filling the stall. These sensations only served to ramp her up more.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio varied the routine continuously, changing speed and rhythm, adding a little quirk and twist of the fingers, rubbing a thumb over and around Agatha's clit.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please, please, please," Agatha found herself chanting, and she was not sure what she wanted.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good girl, Agatha. You're taking me so well. Fuck, I could do this to you all night."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Agatha choked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Just as it was all coming together, as Agatha was on the edge of what she was sure would be <u>th</u><u>e</u> climax of a lifetime, there was an instant of distraction when Rio's phone buzzed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Shit. Can you cum for me, Agatha? Cum all over my fingers? Be a good girl and cum for me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The prompting seemed to help, and soon Agatha felt as if she had pitched headlong over a cliff, letting out a rough, growling moan as slick squirted over Rio's hand. In the aftermath, Agatha was certain she would fall to the floor, but Rio buoyed her up.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Okay, <em>cariño</em>. Just let it go. I gotcha. Fuck, that's hot. Fuck, you squirted so good, babe."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio kept pumping away for a few moments, then gently eased the fingers out.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Easy. Think you can stay on your feet?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Y-yeah," Agatha nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">To her great surprise, Rio leaned in and kissed her again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"That was beautiful. I... Wow. You're beautiful, Agatha."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Th-thanks."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Smiling, Rio once more cupped Agatha's chin—thankfully with the hand that wasn't soaking.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You got a ride home tonight?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... A friend and I got a rideshare. But I... She won't mind if we leave separately."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<u>Just</u> a friend?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just. Barely, even."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You stick around, I could give you a lift later. You want that?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... I... Yes."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You sure? You don't have to..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I want it."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Okay, yeah. You hang around the booth near closing time. Now, I gotta get back out there. You okay on your own?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, feeling so fucked out she could hardly think. It had been a <u>long</u> time since someone else made her cum.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">After one last kiss, Rio turned and unlocked the stall.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Remember. Stick around the booth, and then we'll see where the night takes us later."</p></div>

<div align="left"><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Jen, it transpired, had already been looking for Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Met someone," Jen blurted, downing... Well, whatever number of Manhattans she was on.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Great," Agatha said, "have a good time!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, I will! You okay for a ride‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Totally! I met someone too!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, then gestured toward the DJ booth.

Actually, she looked to be heading out with a whole crew of people.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hope it's a fun orgy," Agatha muttered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She decided, in the interests of remaining relatively clear-headed for whatever might lie ahead, to stick to water for the rest of the night. Given the experience Rio had given her in the stall, she wanted to be able to be fully aware for whatever happened next. Frankly, she was also hoping to reciprocate some of the pleasure. Agatha Harkness was many things, but she would never be a selfish lover.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Well, selfish hook-up.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She let her eyes scan around the club as the night stretched on, but in the end her eyes kept wandering back to Rio. She allowed herself the indulgence of imagining a life they might have together. Of course they would likely not last beyond tonight—Agatha had, at the ripe old age of 24, already given up on hoping to ever find a lasting relationship. She was too needy, too cold, too in her own head.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Still, she could imagine.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio, she thought, would be gentle in bed. Always checking that Agatha felt safe, <u>was</u> safe, and that whatever they were about to do was deeply wanted. Concerned more for Agatha's comfort and pleasure than anything else.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It would be nice to have a lover like that. It would be a real change from past experience. From...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Oh, no. No going down that thought path, especially not in public.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The joy of imagination temporarily soured, Agatha took to her phone as distraction. There she sat at the end of the bar, water bottle clutched in her hand, scrolling thoughtlessly, when a hand came to rest on her shoulder. She looked up and Rio was there, smiling at her. The sunglasses were finally off, revealing wide, tearful-looking dark brown eyes that Agatha could easily get lost in. Rio leaned close to almost whisper, breath warm against Agatha's cheek.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You ready to head out?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yup," Agatha squeaked, nodding.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good girl. C'mon."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For an instant, Agatha hesitated. Was this stupid, leaving with someone she had just met? But Rio smiled at her and took her hand.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You want me to call you a car instead?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh, no. No, I... I just..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You don't have to go anywhere with me, sweetheart, but I promise you're safe with me, and I promise you a good time if we <u>do</u> leave together."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... I wanna go with you..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha trailed off, not entirely sure why she felt so nervous. Rio smiled, kissed her cheek, then whispered again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'll take care of you. Make sure you get home safe."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You good with riding a motorcycle?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh, sure. Yeah."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I can always call us a car, sweetheart."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, it's all good. I've been on motorcycles before."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha slid off the barstool, and Rio looked around her briefly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Got a coat with you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha shook her head.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I didn't figure I'd need one."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"All right. Stay here just a second, okay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For a moment, Rio's warm hands cupped her face, and those soft lips pressed the most delicate of kisses to Agatha's brow. Then Rio released her, turned, and disappeared off behind some staff only door at the other end of the bar. Agatha shivered not with cold, but with a broken sort of wonder. That kiss had been so gentle that it made her feel... Something. Something beyond raw lust—not that she minded raw lust—that made her heart flutter in a way it had never done.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr"><em>'Fuck, what if this is just a heart condition?'</em> she panicked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio returned quickly, hauling the massive puffy coat Agatha recalled from earlier in the night.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You can wear this. I just have it on for the look when I start my sets, but it's super warm."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio laid something aside on the edge of the bar and helped Agatha pull the coat on, then grinned at her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You look cute."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha felt herself blush, and Rio huffed out a little laugh.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're even cuter when you blush."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, you're always cute," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? Huh. See what you say in the morning."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Grabbing the set aside item, an ancient looking cellphone, Rio checked something on it.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sure you wanna ride with me?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I do," Agatha nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, c'mon then. Your place or mine?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"How far is yours?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio shrugged.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"'Bout 12 blocks north."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Way closer than mine. Your place it is, then."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They left the club by a back exit, Rio grabbing a battered leather jacket and shrugging it on along the way. The motorcycle was parked practically up along the back wall, helmet secured to the handlebars with black cord tied in some absolutely gordian configuration. A spare helmet was produced from the under seat storage, and Rio carefully helped Agatha fit it on and fasten it.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sorry to mess up your hair."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's all right," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I won't drive too fast, but hold on nice and tight once we're underway."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I will."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The ride over to Rio's was... Well, it was a motorcycle ride. The city blurred by, lights streaking the darkness, and Agatha held on to Rio for dear life. When they stopped, having pulled into a quite dark parking structure, Agatha realized she was shivering, not with the cold, but with a mix of worry and anticipation. Rio helped her off the bike and took her helmet, tucking it away.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You all right?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, not trusting her words at the moment.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You feel safe with me?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yes."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. Because you are, you know? You're safe. Come on, let's head inside."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio lived in a part of the city that was formerly industrial, specifically in an old factory that had been repurposed into a mixed space: housing and work/studio spaces.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Elevator's down," Rio explained during the three floor walk up.<br/>
"The cables caught on fire last month."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"The cables?" Agatha mused.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yup. We think it was ghosts."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The apartment itself, once they arrived, was not bad: mostly one big space with a few areas sectioned off with quickly built partitions or artfully arranged folding screens.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"My little kingdom," Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's..." Agatha trailed off.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Laughing, Rio put an arm around her shoulders.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's a place to live. You want anything? Glass of water or anything?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Do you have a bathroom?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Just over through there."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio pointed to the one door in the apartment that was not the entrance. Nodding and smiling, Agatha doffed the big coat, then headed for the relative seclusion of the bathroom. Behind her, Rio whistled some tune softly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She had to look around a bit for the light switch, which flicked up with a satisfying <em>THWONK</em>, summoning to life a veritable midday sun from overhead. The bathroom revealed was neat and orderly, though it seemed to have been decorated in the 1970s with a minor goth inclusion at some point. Harvest Gold toilet with a faux-wooden lid and seat, Avocado Green tub. The sink was white, built in to a matte black cabinet and featuring a backsplash of dark tile. The floor, meanwhile, was tiled in a sort of sickly pink. There was a double-doored medicine cabinet above that looked to be made of rattan.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">While she used the toilet, Agatha amused herself looking at Rio's things neatly arranged on the counter. Thick white bar of soap on the edge of the sink. An old mug with a faded image of Snoopy held a toothbrush, and a hairbrush and comb lay neatly beside it. There was a small container of floss on the opposite side of the sink, a bottle of mouthwash, and then, quite randomly, what looked to be a jug of liquid laundry detergent.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Finishing her business, Agatha washed up and stepped back out into the apartment proper. Rio had hung up their coats and was sitting on an uncertain looking old sofa, very stiffly at the edge of the cushions. One glance at Agatha, however, and the posture eased, a smile gracing Rio's delightfully soft face.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You all good?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, and Rio stood, crossing to her, cradling her face in those strong, warm hands, and kissing her with a tenderness that made her feel strangely delicate.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Come to bed?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Definitely."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The bedroom was beyond one of the not-quite-ceiling-height partition: a space where a platform bed sat on a large, dark rug. There was a nightstand with a small, bare-bulbed lamp and an old-fashioned alarm clock, and opposite the foot of the bed was an old chest of drawers and what looked like a footlocker.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Going to the bed, Rio turned back the sheets, then turned back and held a hand out to Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Don't wanna rush you, okay? We can go as fast or slow as you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha shrugged.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I mean, you already fingered me in a bathroom. We could probably just get on with things."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sure. But I wanna be sure you're okay with everything. Like, if there's anything you aren't into."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm not into being beaten up or tied down very much, at least not on a first date. Everything else is on the table."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio grinned and sat on the edge of the bed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"This a date, then?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Carefully, Agatha went and leaned down, gripping the front of Rio's shirt so she could finally take the lead during a kiss.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Does it feel like a date?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Nodding, Rio groaned into the kiss and got a grip on Agatha's waist. It barely took any movement to propel the both of them back on the bed. Agatha felt definite pressure from the bulge she had noted earlier, and she snaked her hand between their bodies to cop a feel.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You okay with that?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mmm, I'm very okay with it, so long as you know what you're doing."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, I'm a master cocksman."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah? You got a little badge or anything to prove it?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nah. Don't need it. I can prove it all on my own."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Shifting slightly, Agatha sat up astride Rio's hips, grinding down. Proudly, she watched as Rio's eyes almost rolled back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, sweetheart. Fuck, c'mere and let me kiss you again."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hold your horses," Agatha smirked, wriggling slightly and pulling her dress up and off, then tossing it aside.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Damn, you got good tits," Rio groaned.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks. Do I get to see you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">That seemed to pause things for a moment. A worried look crossed Rio's face and she sat up, wrapping her arms around Agatha's waist.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I, uh... I have... Like, I got a lot of scars and I usually keep my shirt on so no one has to see..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay," Agatha said, "okay, baby. It's all right."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She stroked Rio's hair. For just an instant, she let herself indulge the possibility of there being more to this than just a one night stand. Some odd protective instinct welled up in her chest, and she kissed the top of Rio's head.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You don't mind?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Of course not. We both deserve to be comfortable."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I just... Really I don't wanna make <u>you</u> uncomfortable."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're not. Honestly, I'm very comfortable right now."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... I feel like I need to tell you stuff. Like it... I..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio trailed off with an exhausted little huff of breath, and Agatha smiled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You tell me whatever you want or need me to know."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I bind and stuff. Is that bad?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No. Why would it be?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Some girls... It freaks 'em out."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, I'm not freaked out."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry I'm... That this is stupid now."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's not stupid. You were concerned that I feel safe with you. Why shouldn't it go both ways?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha pushed Rio's shoulders gently, just enough to cause a sit back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Are you... The binding, the packing. Are you..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nonbinary, I guess. Good ol' they-slash-them."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. I just need to know so I don't say something wrong."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You won't," Rio said, and Agatha laughed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, thank you for having faith in me. Now, I believe you were going to show me your skills..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh," Rio said, and flipped them over, "I got some other things you need to experience first."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It was a bit of a fuss for a moment, getting moved around to lie not across the bed, but the more traditional way. Rio was gentle, Agatha was eager. Then came a rain of kisses and nips and licks along Agatha's neck, over her breasts—Rio paid particular attention there—and down her abdomen until Rio's teeth could grip the waistband of Agatha's panties.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, aren't you the eager pup?" Agatha teased, and to her delight, Rio growled softly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">There was a gentle tug, and Agatha raised her hips to allow the garment to be pulled down. Eventually Rio was knelt on the end of the bed, one brow raised, panties still held between those pearly whites. The sight was somehow enough to send a jolt through Agatha. Smiling, she crooked a finger.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Get back up here."</p></div></div>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio had practically pounced on Agatha after throwing the underwear over to lie on the floor with the discarded dress, but after that things paused again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're beautiful," Rio murmured, and then kissed Agatha's forehead.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So are you," Agatha managed, rushing the words out over the sudden threat of tears squeezing her throat.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Still wanna..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. I do."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. 'Cause I... You okay if I go down on you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, fuck. I am totally and completely okay with that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio followed much the same path down Agatha's body as before, but this time there was nothing to stop their strong fingers from prodding gently at her flesh.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Damn. You always get this wet?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Only with the right sort of person," Agatha said, then gasped as Rio stroked her clit.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I must be exactly your type then. Fuck, sweetheart."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">If Rio proved, once again, to be particularly deft with digital touch, once things moved on to lingual...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck!" Agatha gasped.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Her legs shuddered as Rio lapped at her experimentally. The rumble of an amused chuckle against her cunt only made the trembling spread, and Agatha, needing to anchor herself as her mind quickly shut out all but the pleasure, buried the fingers of her left hand in Rio's hair. Momentarily, they moved and pressed a kiss to the soft skin of Agatha's right inner thigh.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You good?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'll be good," Agatha whimpered, not really thinking, responding on instinct.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio kissed the opposite thigh and then went back to work. For Agatha, everything was warmth, the delicious tingle of Rio teasing and sucking her clit, a delicate twist of fingers spreading her open.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha had thought she might take a little while to climax this time, but already she felt herself speeding to the edge, hips bucking, seeking to somehow tighten the connection.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, fuck, fuck!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It hit her like a wild wave, like a shot of electricity to the spine, and all she could do was ride it out, her grip on Rio's hair tightening. Her other hand was clutching the sheets like that was its sole intended purpose. There came an instant, before the last of her ability to think properly vanished, when she genuinely thought this <em>petit mort</em> might actually be the big one, the grand finale, and she found that she was glad. At least she would pass away happy. Of course, she did survive, but for a while she drifted in mindless pleasure, trembling, loose-limbed and warm.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr"><em>'Mind </em><em><u>literally</u></em><em> blown,'</em> was the first coherent thought that returned to her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">As the fuzz of bliss fell from her mind, Agatha felt Rio still down there, working delicately away. At some point she had released the iron grip on their hair, and they were now holding her hand. She squeezed softly, and they squeezed back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Agatha groaned, and wondered if she would ever regain any form of stronger articulance.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay?" Rio asked, raising up to rest their chin on her mons.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"M-more than that. Fuck. You... Fuck."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I do indeed," they rasped.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Kiss me? Please?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio moved to be not on top of her, but beside her, and pulled her close into their arms, kissing her warmly again and again. It was tempting to snuggle into the circle of their arms and simply to fall asleep, but Agatha knew there was more she wanted at the moment.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck me?" she asked, reaching to trace their bulge with a fingertip.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sure you want it?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck yes, I want it. Wanna feel you inside me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Even in the dark, Agatha could see Rio blush deeply, and they kissed her again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... You don't have to let me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm not letting. I'm telling. Now, if <u>you</u> don't want to..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I want to. I do."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">When Rio did not move right away, Agatha popped open the top button of their fly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can I see it?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. You can... Yeah."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The next button popped open, and the next, and soon the fly was fully apart and Agatha slipped her hand in, grazing against the front of tight boxer briefs. These had a fly as well, the standard little flap, and beyond that, she found the firm warmth she had been seeking.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're so hard," she said, stroking the length.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... It..." Rio choked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Such a big, hard boy."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio shivered, a small smile quirking around their lips. Gently, Agatha pulled the cock free and looked down at it. It was fairly ordinary looking, maybe seven inches long, not horrifically thick—thank goodness. The silicone was neon green swirled with black. It would probably feel quite pleasant.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Is it all right?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Very handsome," Agatha nodded, meeting their gaze and seeing them blush again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha let go, reaching to gather some of the moisture from between her own legs and then stroking it over the length of the cock. Rio whimpered and groaned, then thrust quickly into her grip.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're all ready to go, aren't you?" Agatha said with a smirk.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I've been ready since back at the club," Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh no. My poor handsome boy, suffering so long."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio suddenly tensed a moment, and Agatha worried she had said the wrong thing.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Should I not..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're doing everything just right," Rio assured her, then grunted and thrust again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, then we'd better get down to business."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded a few times in an odd, broken rhythm, then kissed Agatha once more and rolled her onto her back, settling on top of her and pressing the tip of the cock against her entrance.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Want it?" they asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Definitely."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">A single smooth, careful stroke left Agatha feeling just filled, and she wrapped her legs around Rio's hips.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Such a good boy," she said, and Rio's eyelids fluttered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Gonna make me finish too soon," they muttered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, we wouldn't want that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The pace Rio set, once they started to move, was easy at first, even gentle, and Agatha allowed herself to be lulled by the slowness, as well as the soft, lingering kisses that Rio kept pressing to her lips and cheeks and forehead.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're so pretty," Rio sighed, "and you feel so good."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You feel good," Agatha responded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">As they went on, Rio picked up speed, head dropping down by Agatha's shoulder.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck," they whispered, "you're so tight. You take me so good."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Smiling, Agatha stroked Rio's hair. Something about this moment, even though it was simply sex, was so good and soft and sweet. When Rio raised up and kissed her again, she captured their face between her hands.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Too fast?" Rio panted, slowing down.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No. Perfect. Just wanna... Oh, fuck! Wanna look into your beautiful eyes."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Again Rio blushed and smiled, for a moment pressing their forehead to Agatha's.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're good," they said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha's heart swelled, and she almost felt tears trying to rise again. Fighting the sensation down—how ridiculous would it be to cry right now?—she smiled. Rio ceased all motion and kissed Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Damn you're beautiful, Agatha."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thank you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">When the fucking began again, everything was slow, no rush at all. Eventually, however, things picked up again, and Agatha felt little tremors in Rio's body.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I gotta..." Rio trailed off.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Anything you need," Agatha assured them.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Can I... Can I cum?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Of course, baby. Cum inside me," Agatha whispered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh fuck yes. Please!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Mierda</em>."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio's face went tense.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Voy a correrme</em>," they groaned.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Está bien, cariño</em>," Agatha said, clinging to Rio, stroking their back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Voy a correrme</em>. <em>Te voy a dejar preñada</em>."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha moaned, the words impacting the perfect part of her mind, and she answered without really thinking.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Preñame</em>."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuuu," Rio wheezed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Their body stiffened and shivered as they instinctively thrust in deeper, and Agatha wrapped her legs tighter around their hips.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good boy. Give me all you've got. Oh, fuck, you're such a good boy."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio whined, hips twitching back slightly, then collapsed onto Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, fuck, fuck," Rio groaned.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You like that, pretty boy?" Agatha asked, petting their hair.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck yes. That... Fuck, we just met and you know how to push my buttons."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're no slouch yourself in that department."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For a long time they just lay there together, Rio trying to recover, Agatha enjoying the compression of her newfound lover on top of her. When Rio finally groaned and rolled away, Agatha whimpered at the sudden emptiness. Immediately, Rio moved to embrace her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Is it okay I said that?" Rio whispered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Perfectly. I mean, I think you heard me respond."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I did. I... Just didn't wanna make you uncomfortable."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, you did nothing of the kind, Rio. Fuck, you're wonderful."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So are you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then there was silence for a while, for so long that Agatha felt herself being pulled down into sleep. She sighed happily and pressed a kiss to Rio's cheek.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can I get up a sec?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hmm?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Gotta take meds."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh. Oh, yeah. I should... Could I use your bathroom again?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Come on."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Together, they left the bed. Agatha padded after Rio to the bathroom, barely noticing as Rio went to the sink, pulled the cock from the harness, and washed it. As Agatha sat and relieved herself, Rio washed up further, took a few pills with a cupped handful of water, then began pulling bits of kit from the medicine cabinet.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"What's all that for?" Agatha asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Pain shot," Rio said, and sure enough Agatha noticed a little syringe.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh. Are you... Is the pain..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not so bad, but sometimes... Well, I take this each night. Usually takes me through most of the day."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha sat, feeling a bit like an intruder, and watched the whole process. It all looked very steady, very practiced, and once things were complete, Rio disposed of the syringe in the detergent container by the sink.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"All done," Rio said, and smiled down at Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then Rio washed their hands and left the bathroom. Agatha still sat there a while, worrying. Should she do anything to try and help Rio? <u>Could</u> she do anything?</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Once Agatha had cleaned up, she left the bathroom and found Rio sitting on the edge of the bed, having finally changed out the button down shirt and tight pants from earlier for a faded gray t-shirt and plaid pajama pants.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Do you have to leave?" Rio whispered as Agatha approached.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Do you want me to leave?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, but if you need to..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I don't."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. I'd like it if you stay. If you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, I want," Agatha rushed, and crawled back into bed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio lay down beside her and sighed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I really am glad you'll stay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'll get out of your way as soon as you need in the morning."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... You could... You could stay for breakfast. I could take you home."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mmm," Agatha breathed, "I'd like that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Scooting closer, she cuddled up against Rio, grateful when strong arms wrapped around her. Soon enough, she felt sleep truly taking her, and she felt Rio kiss her forehead softly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sleep well, Agatha."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You too."</p></div>

<div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha was a little confused when she woke alone in a strange bed, but there was the warmth of very soft sheets to calm her and after a moment her mind caught up. Rio. She had gone home from the club with Rio. They had come back to the DJ's apartment together, and...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Well, normally Agatha tried not to overstate things, but she thought she had never felt more sated on a morning after.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">With a small grunt, Agatha turned over, stretched, and sat up, a hint of cool air sending a shiver up her spine. Fuck, all she had to put on were the things from last night. She felt awkward at the thought of leaving the bed naked. Sure, Rio had seen her naked last night, but...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hey. Good morning."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">There was Rio, peering around the partition, smiling.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good morning," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio came and sat on the edge of the bed, and Agatha scooted closer.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're so beautiful," Rio murmured.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha huffed out a laugh.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Really? First thing after a long night?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I suspect you're always beautiful."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then Rio leaned down and kissed Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm making us breakfast. You wanna clean up or anything?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I <u>would</u> love a shower."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool. I'll get you a towel and stuff."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio kissed Agatha again, then got up and went down to the footlocker at the end of the bed. Agatha sat up and watched them pull out a towel and a washcloth.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Here we go," they said, standing slowly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Are you in any pain?" Agatha asked, noting a slight tense expression.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No. The medicine helps. Here, I'll put these in the bathroom for you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha watched Rio head to the bathroom and stretched languorously. This was the first good morning after she remembered in... Ever, really. Quiet, gentleness, no rushing. As she left the bed, she smiled. Rio was terribly sweet—sweeter than she might have expected from their cockiness on first meeting.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They were just exiting the bathroom as she went to enter, and there was a mutual wobble of nearly running into each other.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Easy," Rio murmured, and steadied Agatha with hands on her hips.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The hands stayed there, gentle and soothing, for a good while, and then Rio leaned in for a little kiss.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good morning," they sighed once more as the kiss ended.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"A very good morning," Agatha agreed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You... I can lend you some clothes for after your shower so you won't have to eat breakfast naked."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thank you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I've had a really good time with you so far."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"And I've had a really good time with you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Could... This is gonna sound so stupid..." Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"What?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Could I just... Give you a hug?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Of course."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio shifted their stance a little, arms slipping around easily, and pulled Agatha close. Agatha, in turn, wrapped her arms around their neck. Rio was warm, wreathed in mingled scents of spice and resin and light sweatiness, and Agatha felt their body relax as she embraced them, posture going utterly soft.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio sighed and nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You just... You're nice. Really nice."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hmm. Not many would say so."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, I do."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha chuckled and dared to kiss the curve of Rio's jaw.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're really nice," she murmured, and felt them shiver in her arms.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Rio eased away, smiling.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You go get that shower, huh? I'll get you somethin' to wear and then finish up breakfast."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">In the bathroom, Agatha looked in a drawer beside the sink and found a clip, twisting her hair up out of the way with it. For a moment she surveyed herself in the mirror, taking in the remnants of her makeup and a few little hickeys beginning to bloom on her neck and chest. Normally the marks might have annoyed her, but somehow the fact that Rio had made them meant that they were all right.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It took a moment to get the water comfortably adjusted, but soon enough Agatha was rewarded with a nice, steamy shower. Rio's soap was redolent of vanilla and something earthy and woody, and Agatha paused to breathe in the scent for a moment. In a strange way, it made her feel strangely safe.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Stepping out of the shower, Agatha eagerly wrapped herself in the towel—it was wonderfully plush—and let her hair down. She saw that some clothes had been left for her on the cabinet by the sink and, drying off quickly, slipped them on. Clad in a pair of loose black sweatpants and a massive gray hoodie, Agatha headed out into the rest of the apartment again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio was in the sort-of kitchen area. There were cabinets, of course, and a sink, plus a little convection-and-cooktop combo for most of the cooking, a microwave, and a rather new-looking fridge. As far as seating, there was a battered old Samsonite card table with three folding metal chairs arrayed around it. It was an altogether eclectic assemblage, and Agatha found it oddly homey.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She dared to approach Rio, who was busy with cooking, and to lean against the counter nearby.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, chef, what're we having?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio looked at her, grinning.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just basic stuff. A cheese-and-spinach omelette, turkey bacon, and sweet rolls. You like coffee or tea or neither?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Tea would be nice."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Excellent, because that's what I'm having. You want green, Earl Grey, oolong..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Surprise me," Agatha said, and Rio laughed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"A woman who likes spontaneity. Careful, Agatha, or you'll capture my heart."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Will I?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, most assuredly."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Turning from her work, Rio kissed Agatha deeply.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Go and sit, sweetheart," they said, and something in the softness of the words made Agatha want to melt.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Choosing the chair with the least battered paint job, Agatha sat and watched Rio work, deftly bringing everything together before carrying two plates to the table and setting one before Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Look worthy?" Rio asked, nodding to the dish.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It looks amazing."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. Those culinary arts classes paid off then."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed and took up the fork Rio had placed near the plate.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Have you really taken classes like that?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Don't tell me you're secretly a chef at some high-end restaurant who does DJing on the weekends."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nope," Rio said, bringing two cups of tea over to the table, "I'm a funeral director."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yup. That freak you out?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not at all," Agatha shrugged.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool. A lot of girls, it freaks 'em out."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You must have a wide history of dating, and please pardon my phrasing here, a lot of scaredy-cats."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Maybe."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They sat and ate together, Agatha trying to keep a handle on her eating style, going slowly, chewing carefully, not wolfing her food. She thought she might be doing poorly when, suddenly, she realized that Rio had stopped eating and was watching her carefully. Setting her fork down, she let her hands rest in her lap.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Is there something wrong?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No," Rio said, "I just like that you clearly appreciate food."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Are you making fun of me?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No. No way! You just really seem into the food, and that makes me feel proud. You like what I cooked for you. I'm glad."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha wondered if she should break down that her appreciation for food was more a desperate fear of never having any. Was the morning after a one night stand too soon to info dump about her horrific childhood? Would it seem weird to just spew the facts?</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Definitely.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You cook really well," she said softly, telling the truth.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Did I say anything wrong?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nah. Just life stuff."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ah. Well, I really am just glad you like the food."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled and slowly took back up her fork.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, to completely change the subject," she said, "what do you do besides funeral directing and DJing and culinary studies? Got any hobbies?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I like to garden. We have a community garden up on the roof of this place, and I really like to go up there. I'll show you sometime, if you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'd like that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"And what do you do," Rio asked, "besides teaching?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Stay at home and avoid socializing," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? How's going out to the club figure into that?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, my friend Jen dragged me along. She insists I need a social life."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ah, well, aren't you glad she <u>did</u> drag you out? After all, otherwise you wouldn't've met me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm mentally filling out the Nobel prize application for her as we speak."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, and their dark eyes were filled with such mirth that Agatha could not help but feel a throb of something tender in her heart. Somehow, she kept having soft, protective feelings toward Rio, even though they had just met. She wanted to wrap this sweet, kind person up in the softest blanket possible and just keep them safe.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You got anything planned this weekend?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not really. I don't socialize much, like I said. I just sort of... Exist."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, seeing as how you stayed for breakfast, would you wanna exist with me a while longer?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'd really like that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good," Rio nodded, "'cause I hate doing dishes alone."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They did indeed do the dishes together after breakfast, and then they snuggled up together on Rio's battered brown couch. It was nice, just sitting together, breathing each other in. It was very quickly apparent that Rio had a fondness for playing with hair, and presently Agatha realized that any large tangles and snarls in her own wild mop had been  deftly worked out with Rio's fingers.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Could I, like, braid your hair?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"If you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio left the sofa for a moment, returning quickly from the bathroom with a couple of hair ties, a hand mirror, a small black comb, and a joyful expression.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You sure you're not also a hairdresser?" Agatha asked as Rio went to work.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"My last foster mom is one," Rio said, "and I used to hang around her shop a lot. Still do sometimes, on free days."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? You get along with her pretty well?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm. She's the best mom I ever knew."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Lucky you got her, then."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"In a way," Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">When they had gathered Agatha's hair into two loose braids, Rio handed her the mirror.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"How'd I do?" they asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hmm," Agatha pondered.<br/>"10 out of 10. I don't usually go for the schoolgirl look, but I think you've made it work for me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Definitely."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, a free, unbound laugh that made Agatha feel warm and cozy.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The rest of the morning was spent with Rio showing Agatha all around the building, with a focus on the aforementioned rooftop garden, and then just goofing off in Rio's apartment. Said goofing off consisted heavily of making out and cuddling, and Agatha was certain that she lost control of herself and said a few silly things, but then Rio said silly things too, like going on and on about how Agatha was beautiful, the most beautiful girl they had ever seen. That was pretty silly, at least as far as Agatha was concerned.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">A little after noon, they had a wonderful lunch—Rio ordered takeout from some little Italian place—and then Agatha decided that it was high time to lure Rio back into bed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So," she started, "how would you feel if we were to lie down a little while?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You wanna take a nap?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Something like that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It was easy to curl up together in Rio's bed. Agatha snuggled down with her head under Rio's chin, and she was pleased when Rio nuzzled the top of her head.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're cuddly," Rio murmured, "and that's great."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You a big cuddler?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mmm. But I never really get the chance much."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, I'll cuddle you all you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Truthfully, Agatha had been hoping for a fresh round of sex, but instead she found herself lulled to sleep by the warmth and closeness. When she woke, it did not seem like much time had passed. Rio had moved a bit and was now flopped over on their back, head turned toward Agatha, a little line of tension between their eyebrows. Carefully, Agatha leaned up and kissed the spot. That seemed to soothe the mark away, and then Rio's eyes opened slowly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hi," they rasped.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hi."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You okay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, I'm just fine. You?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Just... Itchy."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... My scars get itchy sometimes."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can I help you feel better?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, it's okay. I don't wanna scare you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I very much doubt you could, baby."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio turned back onto their side, pulling Agatha into their arms.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just could you... Could you rub my back and side, like, here?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They indicated the left side of their torso, and Agatha went to slip her hand under their shirt.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You... You don't have to touch the skin, if you don't want," Rio rushed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Will it be bad if I do?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, just... I just don't want you to be grossed out. You can just touch over the shirt, if you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Do <u>you</u> only want me to touch you over your clothes?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio shrugged.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I just don't wanna scare you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I won't be scared, baby. I wanna help you, okay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's real bad," Rio said, tears filling their eyes.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Shh. Just let me take care of you, okay? Shh. I've got you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Carefully, Agatha reached under the fabric, hand sliding almost immediately over skin that indeed felt heavily scarred. Smoothing her fingers over the surface, Agatha smiled at Rio.</p></div><p dir="ltr">"It's okay. Is this helping?"</p><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Y-yeah," Rio sniffled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Oh, my poor Rio. It's okay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You... I know it probably feels gross..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It just feels like scars. I've got a few of my own. Do they hurt at all?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uhm, they... The pain is from... Just a lot of stuff happened to me, is all."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, if I do anything that hurts, tell me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're good."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha pressed her forehead to Rio's, fingers still moving gently, almost massaging the puckered, rough skin.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thank you for trusting me, Rio."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... You... You're nice. You're... You're nice."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So are you," Agatha whispered, and felt the truth of the words in every fiber of her being.</p></div>

<div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They were together at Rio's apartment, absolutely absorbed in each other, until Sunday morning. Agatha offered to get a rideshare home, but Rio was only too glad to take her on the motorcycle. When they got to Agatha's, Rio came inside for a glass of water.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You can keep the clothes and stuff until we see each other again," they said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha went to her room and dropped off the little gym bag Rio had lent her for her club clothes, then returned to the kitchen to find Rio leaning thoughtfully against the counter.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I've had a really good time this weekend, Rio."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Me too. I... I hope we can keep... I mean, I wanna keep on seeing you, if you're okay with that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm definitely okay with it," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio held out their arms, and Agatha stepped into the embrace. She had never felt so safe being held. She had never felt like she belonged with someone. Rio hugged her tightly, but not <u>too</u> tight, and kissed her cheek.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You think maybe we could be something together?" they whispered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Maybe, if you don't mind damaged goods."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"How could I? I'm damaged too."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha wanted to tell Rio that was untrue, that from all she had seen they were not damaged. They were just hurt. She wanted to help them in whatever way she could, to try and heal the hurt even a little. Of course, she was not sure how to put all of that into words without sounding stupid.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can you stay, just for a little while?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You want me to stay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Only if <u>you</u> want to stay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It won't bother your roommate or anything, having a stranger around?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, for all I know Jen's not even home. She left the club with someone too."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">As if on cue, the apartment door banged open and Jen walked in, still wearing the clothes she had gone out to the club in, looking disheveled but very happy. When she spotted Agatha and Rio together, her eyebrows shot up.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh," she said, "hey."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hey, Jen," Agatha said, trying to keep her tone light.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">From the look in Jen's eyes, there was an interrogation in store later.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Don't mind me," Jen rushed.<br/>"Just need to wash up and change clothes. I have a brunch date."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Lucky you," Agatha nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Jen smiled and shrugged, then looked to Rio.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hey, DJ."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hi," Rio said softly, and Agatha sighed, rubbing a hand gently up and down their back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Jen, this is Rio Vidal. Rio, this my roommate, friend, and one of the many banes of my existence, Jennifer Kale."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nice to meet you," Jen said, already headed for her room.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha watched Jen go, and her annoyance was only dissipated by the sudden realization that Rio was shaking. When she looked, she thought maybe they would be upset or crying, but instead they were clearly fighting to hold in laughter.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Looks like she's had an even wilder weekend than you," they said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, Jen does love meeting new people."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"What about you? You like meeting new people?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Only if I find them worthwhile."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mmm. And have I been worthwhile so far?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Darling, you've been much more than that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha took Rio's hand and led them off to her room.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It isn't much," she said, "but it's home."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Shit. You have so many books!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm a big reader."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I bet. That's fuckin' rad."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah? You like a smart girl?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Absolutely," Rio said, turning and gently backing Agatha up against the door.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They kissed her in a way that screamed of hunger and need, and she was only too happy to let them have their way. When they slipped a leg between hers, Agatha groaned and clung more tightly, riding down against Rio's thigh.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Wanna fuck?" they murmured against her throat.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yes. Oh, fuck! Yes!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Here," Rio sighed, and guided Agatha to hook her left leg around their hip, "let's get to bed."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They lifted her easily and turned, crossing the room in two steps and easing down on the bed with her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You want this?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yes, Rio. Fuck, I... Please, want you to fuck me..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay, <em>querida</em>. Okay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha let out a small whine when Rio moved off of her, but they only left to get started tugging the sweatpants down her legs, then settled right back on her as she kicked the garment away. Once they were in place again, she locked her legs around their hips and humped frantically up against the bulge in their jeans.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Desperate girl," Rio smirked, "you need my cock that bad?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I swear, if you don't get inside me..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay, sweetheart. Fuck, you're soaking my jeans, huh? So fucking wet."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Fumbling with their fly, Rio got it open. The cock that sprang free was maybe a little shorter than the one Agatha had experienced at Rio's apartment, but it looked thicker and was a realistic flesh color. Just as Rio was getting it wet, dragging it up and down Agatha's slit, there was a light knock at the bedroom door.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm headed out!" Jen called.<br/>"Ya'll don't have too much fun!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For a moment, as they listened to Jen's footsteps move away, then heard the apartment door open and close, all was silence between them. Then, Rio started to shake again with repressed laughter, and Agatha could not help but join in.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Great timing, that roommate of yours," Rio whispered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mmm, well, her timing or lack thereof is the least of my concerns right now."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"What's your primary concern of the moment, hmm?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Getting you inside me. Both of us cumming and cumming until neither of us can think anymore. Then maybe a little midday nap."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I like that idea."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? Well, hop to, big boy. Fill me up."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Rio groaned, thrusting half into Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh my God, you're thick."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Like this one? It's a little more me, I think."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, it's definitely... Fuck! Fuck, keep going like that!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio had managed to line things up so that each thrust caused a tight little pressing drag against Agatha's clit. The sensation was delightful, and Agatha groaned as the heat in her belly mounted.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You gonna squirt for me?" Rio muttered, locking eyes with Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The visual connection was at once necessary and almost painfully intimate, and Agatha whimpered, cupping Rio's jaw in her hands.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Will you cum inside me?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"That... Is the goal, <em>querida</em>. Fill you up."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, Rio... Fuck. Please, please..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please what, sweetheart?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, I... I dunno. You feel so good, baby. So fucking good!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled, kissing Agatha softly and keeping up the slow, almost lazy up-and-down, in-and-out of the sex. Everything seemed exactly right, perfect, ideal, and Agatha's mind was rapid fire flickering with memories of all the other intimacies of the weekend so far, of every time Rio had fucked her or gone down on her or fingered her or...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Shit!</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Stop!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">As soon as the word left Agatha's lips, Rio froze, then pulled away and moved to lie beside her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"What's wrong? Was I hurting you? Fuck, sweetheart, I..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, no, I just... Fuck, I'm not... I'm not on birth control, and you've... We haven't used any protection."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Shit," Rio huffed out.<br/>"You're... Uhm, do you track your cycle?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not like I probably should."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Shit. Well, look, it... It's gonna be okay. Look, we can get some, like, morning after stuff. Just... Hey, Agatha, hey..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">But Agatha's mind had snapped over to memories of her last relationship, of her ex being so cruel, so nasty all the time, and of that last betrayal of getting rid of her birth control and then talking her into things and...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Well, it had all ended with Agatha actually being grateful for once that her mother was such a bitch.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">When she came back to the moment, Rio was holding her, not too tight, whispering comforting things, stroking her hair.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"...be okay, sweetheart. It'll all be okay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sorry, I... I just had a nasty ex who kept trying to baby trap me, one way or another, and..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I would never do that to you, I promise. Look, here, let me get my phone and we'll order the stuff right now, okay? We probably don't even have to worry, since those kinds of pregnancies are so rare without a lot of effort..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, trust me, my ex put in the effort."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, Agatha, are you..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Therapy has helped. Look, you don't have to worry, okay? I... I'll get the pills, and you can just... I dunno. You can head out or whatever. Everything's all fucked up now anyway and..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No it's not. I mean, for me it's not. But if you want me to go..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio was already moving as if to leave the bed, but Agatha reached out.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please! Please, I... I didn't mean..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">And the tears she had fought back all weekend, the tears that had threatened every time Rio called her beautiful, or every time they were so nice that it almost hurt, broke through. Instantly Rio was holding her, settling her on their lap and rocking her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hey. Hey, I gotcha. It's okay. You're safe, sweetheart. Fuck, I wanna... I just wanna fix it all. Okay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio pressed a soft kiss to Agatha's temple.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Let me get the pills for you, okay? I wanna help, since I... Well, I feel like I screwed up."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Y-you didn't. You've been so... So nice. I... I just..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha let herself cry, clinging to Rio, her tears soaking their shirt.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay, <em>querida</em>," Rio murmured, "you just let it all out. Okay. <em>Estás a salvo conmigo, querida</em>."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Rio moved to settle Agatha back on the bed, pulling the sheet and blanket up over both of them.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm going to get the pills, okay? I'll have them delivered here, and everything'll be fine. What's the apartment number again?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha mumbled out the address, and Rio took out their phone, busily tapping away.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Is there anything like... Okay, there's a couple different brands here. Anything better, or that..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just whatever's cheap."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. You want anything else? Little treat might help you feel better?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You don't have to..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please? I just wanna give you anything that'd make you feel better."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha sighed, hands fidgeting together.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Chocolate milk?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? We can do that. Fuck, I love chocolate milk. Gonna get us a whole half-gallon. You like those little spicy stuffed tortilla chips? You know the ones you bite into and it's like powdered jalapenos inside?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I would live on them if I could," Agatha admitted.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sweet! Chips too."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled a little, tapping in the last of the order.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Got it in. Stuff should be here in no time."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Laying the phone aside on Agatha's nightstand, Rio smiled and smoothed back Agatha's hair.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Guess we both been through some shit, huh?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... I g-guess," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, look, I... I really like you, Agatha. Maybe it's fuckin' crazy, but you got somethin' about you I just can't resist."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They scooched down in the bed and opened their arms.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hold you while we wait?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It seemed so easy to settle back into Rio's arms, to let them cuddle her and caress her. They did not strike her as someone with hidden intentions or ulterior motives. They were just kind.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">When the phone buzzed with notification that the delivery was nearby, Rio released Agatha from the comforting embrace a moment, rolling away, frantically stuffing the packer back into their jeans and zipping up.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Be right back," they said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">While they were gone, Agatha turned onto her back, arms behind her head, and stared at the ceiling. Rio was probably right that there was little to be concerned about, but it was no good taking a chance. Sure, this probably meant the whole thing between them, whatever it might have been, would be over now, but maybe they could stay friends.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha had never had a lot of friends, and Rio seemed like they would make a nice addition to the tiny circle.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">When Rio returned with the bag, they took the pills out and set them on the nightstand, then offered the big pack of chips to Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"For my sweetheart," they said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No problem. I, uh, got some other things too. Some cots and dams for, ya know, next time maybe we wanna get... Ya know. Intimate."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The package that Rio set on the nightstand was a retina-searing pink, and something about it made Agatha laugh. Rio smiled, reaching out and stroking her cheek.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Now, I'm gonna go pour us some little glasses of this delicious chocolate milk. Really get this party started."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio left again, returning moments later with the glasses of milk. They set those on the nightstand as well, then stood by the bedside, staring down at their own feet, hands behind their back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Thanks for... For letting me in," they said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, thank you for being understanding."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I try. People are... They're hard to understand, but I try. And listen, about Saturday, that first time I fucked you like that, if what I said..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Rio, I didn't mind it. You were lost in the moment. So was I. And truthfully, it was nice."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?" Rio breathed, looking at Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, patting the bed beside her so Rio would sit.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It was nice, because in that moment everything was good. You weren't hurting me, or forcing anything."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You sure it's okay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. With you, it... It was perfect. Beautiful. Sweet."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Good. I... Like I said before, I really like you. I wanna keep seeing you. I... You're pretty cool."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're pretty cool too, ya know?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah, I know."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For a moment, Agatha recognized the cockiness from their first meeting, and she felt pleased. She liked the gentle, kind Rio she had been getting to know, but that confidence was what had first drawn her in.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I wanna keep seeing you too," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? Good. I mean, I'd understand if you didn't, what with me being so irresponsible..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I was more than a little irresponsible too. But we've got it together now, right? Got a handle on things?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded, a tiny smirk twisting their mouth.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Yeah, I think we got it."</p></div>

<div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, I'm gonna need you to tell me everything."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha sighed, taking the glass of wine Jen offered and slumping down a little on the sofa. It was Thursday night, and they had both been so busy all week that they had not had time before now to catch up and report on their weekend experiences. Taking a long sip of her drink, Agatha closed her eyes.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, I wish we could afford the good stuff."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah, well, for now, it's boxed Zinfandel or nothing. Now, spill."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"The wine?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Agatha..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fine, fine. Whatcha wanna know?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Like I said. Everything. Rio. You. Last weekend."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, after you abandoned me in favor of that little menage..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It was not... Look, Alice and her friends move in a pack."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh? Do warn me if they turn you into a werewolf too."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Jen scoffed, sinking down onto the other end of the sofa.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Agatha, just dish okay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fine. I went home with Rio in the wee hours of Saturday morning. They offered to call me a rideshare or bring me here themself, but their place was closer."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh-huh, a likely story," Jen nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's true!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I bet. What kind of car do they drive? I didn't spot any unfamiliar ones outside on Sunday."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"That's because they have a motorcycle."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Jen's eyes went wide.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, a cliché bad boy type."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Rio is not a bad boy type," Agatha groused.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh no?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No. They're self-assured, a bit cocky maybe, but they're... Oh my <u>God</u>, Jen, they're so sweet and kind."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">A funny little laugh gasp-snuffled its way out of Jen.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sweet and kind? Oh, you're in trouble now, Harkness."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"What do you mean?" Agatha asked, taking a long pull of her wine.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, I mean, you're a total bitch. If Rio is as sweet as you say..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I am not a <u>total</u> bitch. My <u>mother</u> is a total bitch. I'm just <u>usually</u> a bitch."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Right, right. My mistake."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha's phone jangled, and she looked at it, smiling.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Speak of the devil, Rio's on their way."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"On their way <u>here</u>?" Jen asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, Jennifer, to Jupiter. Of <u>course</u> they're on their way here!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ooh, a cheeky Thursday date?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It is not a date. We just... Well, since tomorrow's the start of a long weekend, we thought we might hang out."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"All weekend? Oh, <u>definitely</u> not a date."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rolling her eyes, Agatha finished her wine.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You got any plans?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not tonight, but Alice <u>is</u> taking me out to dinner on Friday."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ah, dinner. Well, if I don't see you again before that, I hope you have a marvelous time."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Jen cocked a brow, gulping down half of her drink.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Are you really planning to just spend a whole weekend with Rio again?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Possibly."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Girl, you are down <u>bad</u>. I haven't even seen you have a one night stand since... Well, since everything."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just because you don't know every detail of my personal life..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh please, Agatha. You've been basically a shut-in socially for, what, almost three years now?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Two and a half."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Close enough," Jen scoffed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"And anyway, I haven't been a shut-in. I've gone to... To stuff."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"The occasional work mixer, Thanksgiving dinner with your sister and her weird crew, and that annual Womyn Power drum circle thing with your mom?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"That's stuff!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Drinking down the last of her wine, Agatha stood.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Anyway, if you'll excuse me, I need to go get changed. I want to be comfortable."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"For hanging out?" Jen prompted.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha gave a curt nod.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"For hanging out."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Off to the kitchen she went first, and actually poured just a tiny bit more wine for herself. For a moment she stood at the sink, just thinking. Given her little flip out on Sunday, she was surprised Rio still even wanted to be around her. Still, it would be nice to just spend time with someone so generally chill and gentle. It would be nice to have any social life at all away from work.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Draining the glass again, Agatha rinsed it and left it on the drain board, then went to her room. They would be going out for dinner, then back to Rio's apartment to just be together. Agatha had a bit of hope that maybe, just maybe, they might have sex, but once again, considering Sunday, she figured she had blown any chance of that. It was a shame really, because Rio was so gentle and made her feel so safe during.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Sighing, she went to her room. The restaurant was, per Rio, not fancy, but still, Agatha wanted to look presentable.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Slacks. Slacks would be good. And a nice blouse. She agonized a bit over what to do with her hair, knowing it would be inevitably tousled by a motorcycle helmet. When she heard a knock at the apartment door, she winced and hurried to pull her hair back into a not-too-loose chignon. By the time she rushed from her room, Jen had let Rio in and herded them into the living room. Rio sat awkwardly in the old armchair that had been Agatha's "housewarming" gift from her older sister, but as soon as Agatha entered the room, they stood so quickly that they overbalanced and wobbled slightly. On instinct, Agatha went and hugged them.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hi," she said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hey," Rio squeaked, and wrapping their arms around her, "you look really pretty."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks. You look very handsome."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I do, don't I?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It was true; in their dark jeans and half-buttoned cream shirt, Rio looked very handsome indeed. They kissed Agatha's forehead and smiled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You ready to go?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh, yeah. Lemme go grab that gym bag you gave me. I packed some necessities in it in case, you know, I spend the night."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I was hoping you might," Rio said, and grinned.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You two have fun," Jen said, trying to look as if she was busy with her phone.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha rolled her eyes and took Rio's hand.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Wait for me by the door, okay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded and trailed along after, grabbing their jacket from the hook where it had been left when they entered. Hurrying to her room, Agatha got the gym bag, then turned off the light and returned to Rio. Then she remembered her jacket was in the living room.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh shit, hold this," she said, and handed the bag to Rio.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You got it."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Ducking back to the living room, Agatha nearly collided with Jen, who was holding her jacket out to her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks, Jen."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No problem. Call me if anything comes up."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sure, sure."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha strode back toward the front door and found Rio standing, staring at the damn print Mother had insisted Agatha take and that Jen had insisted they hang right by the front door because "what kind of lesbians would we be if we didn't?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hey, so," Rio began, "is that..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm, sure is," Agatha said, shrugging her jacket on.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool. It's... Uhm, it's very detailed."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"My mother is friends with a very certain set of artists. We gonna head out?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh, yeah."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio tore their gaze from the print and turned to Agatha, smiling just slightly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Could I kiss you?" they asked.<br/>
"Like, a kinda... More of a kiss?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Any time you want," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Smile widening just slightly, Rio pulled Agatha close, leaning in nose to nose.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm glad I get to see you again," they whispered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm glad you want to see me again," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I suspect I'll always wanna see you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">And then Rio kissed her with such softness, such tenderness, that Agatha was afraid she would melt into a puddle on the floor. She curled one hand around the back of Rio's neck, moaning, whimpering, wanting more, and soon Rio had her backed up against the door, and things had moved from kissy to decidedly gropey.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, uhm," Rio gasped when they had parted, "what if we were to... To just head straight to my place and order takeout?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I would be very happy with that," Agatha nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool. C'mon."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The ride across town felt particularly exhilarating. The air was cooler still than last weekend, the streets were relatively empty, and though Rio drove carefully, a little thrill of danger coursed up and down Agatha's spine. Perhaps more than danger, however, it was arousal; Agatha felt totally ready for whatever might happen between herself and Rio this weekend.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">As soon as they reached Rio's building they rushed up the three flights of stairs, and the moment the door of Rio's apartment was closed behind them, there was an almost bruising embrace.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Can I say I missed you?" Rio asked.<br/>
"Is it weird if I missed you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, baby," Agatha assured them, "I missed you too. Every time you texted me, all I could think about was wanting to be with you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"We've known each other not quite a week, and I... I wanna... I dunno. You make me feel wild, Agatha. Wilder than usual. Like... Fuck! Like I'm gonna explode with the things I already feel about you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">As they spoke, Rio broke up the words by kissing Agatha's forehead, her cheeks, her lips, and then the once again rested their forehead against hers.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can I take you to bed?" they asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, yes. Any time."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can I... Would it be all right if I made love to you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Isn't that what going to bed is for?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio shrugged slightly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not for some people. Not this soon. But I wanna worship you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The words were softly spoken and so full of emotion that Agatha felt herself blushing. She buried her face against Rio's shoulder.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please," she whispered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please what, <em>querida</em>?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please make love to me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio kissed her again, then smiled and took her hand, leading her to the bed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You feel safe?" they asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Always with you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. I want to be a safe person for you. I feel safe with you, and I want you to feel safe with me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I do."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">At the bedside, Rio halted, stepping away a moment to take off their watch and place it on the night stand.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Would you let me take your hair down?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You can do that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Will you let me undress you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Of course. But I... Rio..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"What?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"When can... I don't want to push you, but when can I see you? All of you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio turned back to Agatha and smiled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Soon, <em>querida</em>. Very, very soon. I know you won't be afraid. Now, turn around for me?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha turned her back to Rio as asked, feeling the long, deft fingers pull the pins from her hair, coaxing it down, combing through it.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You have such beautiful hair," Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thank you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They lifted her hair to the side so that it draped forward over her right shoulder, then moved in close to wrap their arms around her waist.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're beautiful, Agatha. Every part of you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're beautiful too."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled and kissed the back of Agatha's neck.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ain't I, though? But right now, this is about you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Carefully, Rio slid their hands up and undid the top two buttons of Agatha's blouse.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Still safe?" they asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yes."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. I never want to worry you."</p></div>

<div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha looked at her blouse and bra, neatly draped over the footlocker, then down at Rio who was kneeling before her.</p><p dir="ltr">"Still okay?" Rio asked.</p><p dir="ltr">"Wonderful," Agatha said, and ran a hand through Rio's hair.</p><p dir="ltr">Smiling, Rio hugged her waist, then shifted back and undid the button and zipper of the slacks. Slim fingers slipped past the waistband, getting a grip on Agatha's underwear at the same time, and slid everything down.</p><p dir="ltr">"Step out for me," Rio said.</p><p dir="ltr">Stepping aside, Agatha watched Rio stand slowly and move to place the slacks with the other removed garments. When they turned back to her, they untucked their shirt and popped open the three buttons that were actually done up.</p><p dir="ltr">"I trust you," they said.</p><p dir="ltr">When they were close enough, Agatha reached out, hands lightly skimming over Rio's abs, sliding up over their chest until grazing some material other than skin. Agatha froze, but Rio just shrugged.</p><p dir="ltr">"The tape," they said.</p><p dir="ltr">"For binding?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm. That okay?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course. Can I..."</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha trailed off, gnawing her lip. Rio reached out and gently stroked her cheek.</p><p dir="ltr">"What, <em>querida</em>? What do you want?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Can I... Would you hug me? Right now I just... I want to feel your skin against mine."</p><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Yeah. We can definitely do that."</p><p dir="ltr">It was a hug. They had already, in the incredibly short time they knew each other, hugged quite a bit, particularly last Sunday. But this time, skin to skin, felt like a culmination. It was a mark of trust growing between them. Agatha turned her head a little and kissed the side of Rio's neck.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thank you for trusting me."</p><p dir="ltr">"Thank you for being kind to me," Rio said, "and for not judging."</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Rio pulled away again, only enough to shrug off their shirt and then sit on the edge of the bed. They held out their arms.</p><p dir="ltr">"Let me hold you?"</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha settled on their lap, distracted for a moment with studying their now visible tattoos. She had seen hints of them last weekend, but now she could fully appreciate the twining of vines and blossoms that made up a half sleeve on each arm. Hints of similar work showed along the sides of Rio's ribs, and a part of Agatha wondered if everything carried on over and around the scars on their back.</p><p dir="ltr">"So," Rio said, fingers teasing at the base of Agatha's spine, "still good to go?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh, definitely," Agatha said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Good. We'll be careful, okay? I, uhm... I got some protection for here too, since I left that package from Sunday at yours."</p><p dir="ltr">"Thoughtful."</p><p dir="ltr">"I try to be. Don't want any little surprises, huh?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Not... No we don't," Agatha said, catching herself half way.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio smiled at her.</p><p dir="ltr">"Changed your words there," they said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Better phrasing," she shrugged.</p><p dir="ltr">It would be fundamentally stupid to admit that, ever since Sunday, she had been considering certain scenarios. It was too soon in whatever this was to be thinking of that, and Agatha still had a lot to work through in therapy. Then there was the possibility that Rio might not want children. Maybe one day such a discussion could be had.</p><p dir="ltr">One day.</p><p dir="ltr">"Agatha? Hey, you all right?"</p><p dir="ltr">"I... Sorry, I was just..."</p><p dir="ltr">"Seemed pretty far away in your head there for a bit."</p><p dir="ltr">"Just... I..."</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh, shit, did that bring up bad stuff? I... I just wanted to reassure you that we're gonna be careful, that you don't have to worry. I'm sor..."</p><p dir="ltr">"Rio, it's all right. I just had some thoughts. It's okay. Kiss me?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Sure you're all right?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Perfectly fine. Please, just kiss me."</p><p dir="ltr">So Rio kissed her, soft and deep and warm, and when the kiss ended, everything had shifted so that Agatha was lying on the bed, Rio at her side.</p><p dir="ltr">"You're so fuckin' beautiful I almost can't believe it," Rio muttered, pressing a kiss to Agatha's left shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">"I... Rio, please..."</p><p dir="ltr">"What, sweet girl?"</p><p dir="ltr">"I need you. Please, I need you."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm here."</p><p dir="ltr">Rio's touch was reverent, careful, and in the moment Agatha could almost believe that she truly was beautiful. The possibility of such thoughts had been driven out of her mind a few years before, but Rio looked at her with such soft adoration that the walls of doubt cracked, just a bit. Gentle kisses and delicate caresses began to reassure her that she was desirable.</p><p dir="ltr">"Tell me if you want to stop," Rio whispered, then kissed the pulse point at one side of Agatha's throat.</p><p dir="ltr">"Don't you stop. Don't you ever dare stop."</p><p dir="ltr">In some way, it was like a dance unpracticed but instinctively known. Rio moved one way, Agatha moved to align. Another movement, a shift up or down, and then they were back together again, skin to skin, the only major barrier being Rio's jeans. Soon, however, those were removed, and then only a thin layer of cotton separated things. As their legs twined together, Agatha learned by touch that one of Rio's legs bore scars too, quite old by the feel, and she ached for whatever horror had befallen this sweet, caring person. Her own childhood had been disrupted, neglectful, abusive, but it seemed to her that Rio's youth must have been particularly atrocious.</p><p dir="ltr">"We... Could I go down?" Rio asked.</p><p dir="ltr">"Do you want to?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Pretty badly, but I'll only do it if you feel safe."</p><p dir="ltr">"I want you to. I just..."</p><p dir="ltr">"I promise, we'll be careful. I won't touch you without protection, okay?"</p><p dir="ltr">"I know. I trust you. I just feel like I don't do enough for you."</p><p dir="ltr">"You do, Agatha. You do more than enough."</p><p dir="ltr">"Are you sure?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course. I... There's a lot, but trust me, I'm getting so, so much out of this."</p><p dir="ltr">"Okay. If you're sure, baby."</p><p dir="ltr">"I am."</p><p dir="ltr">Then Rio moved to fumble open the nightstand drawer and pull out the appropriate item. They knelt up between Agatha's legs, fingers shaking a little as they opened the packet. Agatha nudged a leg against them, and they looked at her.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have an appointment with my doctor on Tuesday," she said, "and I'm gonna get on the pill again. Should save some trouble, yeah?"</p><p dir="ltr">Rio smiled a little and shrugged, then went back to their struggle.</p><p dir="ltr">"I... I don't mind. I just wanna protect you, ya know? I know maybe there's... There's stuff. I don't wanna do something that would make you scared or would hurt you."</p><p dir="ltr">"I know, and you're so sweet to be concerned. But you know, if you don't want to worry for now, I still have morning after pills at home."</p><p dir="ltr">Again Rio looked up, a little crease of tension between their brows.</p><p dir="ltr">"Are... Uhm, do you... Do you want..."</p><p dir="ltr">"I want whatever would be easiest for you," Agatha said.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't want to be bad to you or something."</p><p dir="ltr">"You aren't. You won't be. I'm saying, for now, it's all right."</p><p dir="ltr">"You sure?"</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding, Agatha pushed herself up on one elbow.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's all right. We can be safe. You don't have to worry."</p><p dir="ltr">"But you..."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm not afraid of you. You're not the person who hurt me. I know you won't try to make me do anything I don't want to do."</p><p dir="ltr">There was a long silence, and then Rio crawled up and kissed Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">"Are you totally sure you feel okay with this?"</p><p dir="ltr">"I am."</p><p dir="ltr">Another kiss, and Rio drew a shuddering breath.</p><p dir="ltr">"If there <u>is</u> a problem, <em>querida</em>, I'll... Well, I'd do whatever you need to help. To take care of you."</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course you would. You're so sweet to me."</p><p dir="ltr">It was all closeness then, union of body on body that Agatha was certain would look almost indivisible from outside. Rio kissed her lips, her neck, and then slowly worked down her body, the still wrapped dam forgotten amid the sheets. Agatha's toes curled prematurely as her mind called up the memory of Rio's oral skills. Yes, protection was a good idea, but at the moment all Agatha could seem to care for was pleasure: as much as possible, as quickly as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"You're sure?" Rio checked after planting a kiss just above Agatha's navel.</p><p dir="ltr">"Completely," Agatha said.</p><p dir="ltr">They grinned at her, kissing the same spot again, then continuing the downward trek. Agatha threaded the fingers of her left hand into their hair, as if to anchor herself and possibly Rio in the moment. No reason to let either of them totally float away with the pleasure.</p><p dir="ltr">The closer things came to ultimate contact, the more she found herself subject to small thrills and shivers of anticipation. It seemed too that each kiss closer to Rio's goal was hotter. Beyond the simple brush of warm lips against equally heated skin, these touches were the near blinding tease of a white-hot iron. When one landed at the meeting point between Agatha's left hip and her pelvis, she whimpered. When the next was squarely on her mons, directly above the top of her cleft, she groaned, hips trembling upward, and she felt Rio make some small, approving noise.</p><p dir="ltr">"Good girl," Rio sighed, and kissed the softness of Agatha's right inner thigh.</p><p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Agatha gasped.</p><p dir="ltr">Coherent awareness scattered for a time, and everything coalesced to the heat of Rio's breath, the pressure of their lips and tongue and fingers, the comforting squeeze as they gripped Agatha's free hand. It was as if the pleasure they offered were already deeply familiar, something Agatha's body deemed itself worthy of. This body, so used to harshness and pain, apparently was fully ready to accept this gentleness. The sense that somehow the darkness of the past was deserved did not dissipate, but it was pushed far, far back in the mind.</p><p dir="ltr">There was only goodness, the sharp curl and snap of building sensation, and beneath that the glow of deep pleasure was settling almost into Agatha's very bones.</p><p dir="ltr">"Please," she rasped, fingers clutching tighter at Rio's hair, "yes! Please, right there!"</p><p dir="ltr">Heat, pressure, abs tensing, and an instant where Agatha looked down and saw that Rio was watching her over the curve of her mons, that the dark eyes were glittering with warmth and need and wonder.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes! Oh, fuck! Fuck!"</p><p dir="ltr">Still the wave rose, swelled, and in a narrow spiral of her consciousness, Agatha was sure that she would be swept away, that she would lose all touch with the world and reality, and that would be fine, perfect, so long as Rio kept stoking the fire in her, kept drawing her up and up and up...</p><p dir="ltr">The climax struck, rushing up every nerve like fire up a trail of accelerant.</p><p dir="ltr">"Rio! Yes, yes, <u>FUCK</u>!"</p><p dir="ltr">Just when the last embers seemed ready to fade, another was oncoming, slamming hard and fast, lifting Agatha up, twisting through her as if it was deserved, as if it was as vital as breathing, and that one nearly snuffed out, for the moment, any lingering doubt born of self loathing.</p><p dir="ltr">Twice more pleasure overwhelmed her, and then Rio was up beside her, holding her, a hand still at her cunt, fingers softly twisting in and out, thumb teasing her clit, drawing out one more great rush of exhilaration before Agatha whimpered, shivered, and squeezed her legs together to close off access.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've got you," Rio said, voice very soft, and kissed Agatha deep, sharing with her the taste of herself.</p><p dir="ltr">"Rio..."</p><p dir="ltr">"Right here, <em>querida</em>."</p><p dir="ltr">"Rio, I... Please don't let me go."</p><p dir="ltr">"I won't, sweetheart. Long as you want me, I'll stay with you, I promise."</p><p dir="ltr">Turning onto her side, Agatha felt the self-directed anger and loathing drifting back into her mind, and she clung to Rio as a sob escaped her.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry if I was bad."</p><p dir="ltr">"You weren't, Agatha. You weren't bad."</p><p dir="ltr">"I... If it... I'm sorry."</p><p dir="ltr">"You got nothing to be sorry for. You're good. So good."</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha pressed a kiss to the hollow between Rio's collarbones, a penitent seeking absolution, and felt Rio kiss the top of her head.</p><p dir="ltr">"<em>Descansa, Ágata. Aquí nada te puede hacer daño.</em>"</p></div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>One month. Agatha had been seeing Rio for one month now. Whatever the relationship was had not been deeply discussed, but the two had been spending as much time together as possible, and Rio continued to be endlessly sweet and kind. They had even stopped by yesterday evening and given Agatha a box of her favorite chocolates.</p><p>"Happy one month," they had said, and kissed her long and slow right there in the apartment doorway.</p><p>Now Agatha sat in her bedroom, phone in hand, practicing a call she thought she might regret.</p><p>"Hey, Val, so about Thanksgiving..." she tried, then stopped herself.</p><p>She knew she would need to proceed carefully regarding this whole thing. Not that she was doing anything earth-shattering, but she was asking her older sister if she could bring someone along to Thanksgiving. If she presented Rio as just a friend, that would probably work, but Agatha herself would feel that she was denying something important. If she presented them as a date... Well, Val had always been protective of Agatha, but since the end of Agatha's last relationship, she had, at times, been absolutely overprotective. There was no telling how she might react to the possibility of Agatha getting back into dating. Probably it would be fine, but there was always a chance she would be weird or something.</p><p>Sighing, Agatha shook her head. She needed to make the call now. She had already asked Rio to accompany her to Thanksgiving dinner, and now she needed to give Val the heads-up. Quickly, she scrolled through her contacts and hit the button to call her sister. There was a knock at the apartment door, but Agatha was too engrossed in listening to the call ringing through to pay much attention.</p><p><em>"Agatha, are you okay?"</em></p><p>"Hey, Val. I'm fine. I just had a question about Thanksgiving."</p><p><em>"Oh, hon, you know you don't have to bring anything. Don't I always handle all the food?"</em></p><p>"Yeah, you do, but this... Listen, would it be okay if I brought someone along to dinner?"</p><p>There was a long pause, and in the middle of it someone knocked softly at Agatha's bedroom door.</p><p>"Hey, <em>querida</em>?" Rio said.</p><p>Agatha muted her end of the call for a moment.</p><p>"C'mon in!"</p><p>Rio shuffled into the room, smiling, but then looked nervous when they saw Agatha on the phone.</p><p>"Do you need..."</p><p>"It's fine. Just calling my sister."</p><p><em>"Hey, Aggie, sweetie,"</em> Val said, and Agatha unmuted the call.</p><p>"Still here, Val."</p><p><em>"Great. I just checked, and we've got plenty of space for you to bring a little friend."</em></p><p>Rio sat on the end of Agatha's bed, trying not to laugh. Agatha cocked a brow at them, and that only made them struggle harder.</p><p>"Uh, actually, Val, Rio's... Rio's not just a friend."</p><p><em>"Oh?"</em></p><p>"Yeah. I've actually been seeing them for a month."</p><p><em>"Oh! Well, good for you! Well, by all means, bring... Rio, was it?"</em></p><p>"Yup."</p><p><em>"Bring Rio along! I'd love to meet whoever you're dating."</em></p><p>"Great, awesome. Thanks, Val. I gotta go."</p><p><em>"Okay. Hey, call me next week, okay? We gotta talk about that trouble Mother's been causing at the home."</em></p><p>"Right, will do. Bye!"</p><p>Ending the call quickly, Agatha sighed and flopped back against her pillows, one arm flung over her eyes. Rio, chuckling, gently squeezed her right ankle.</p><p>"So, I'm more than a little friend, huh?"</p><p>"I am so sorry you had to hear that," Agatha groaned.</p><p>"Nah, nah. My fault for coming in when I did, I guess."</p><p>There was a slightly quake of the mattress as Rio moved, stretching out at Agatha's side.</p><p>"So, Thanksgiving dinner with your sister, huh?"</p><p>Agatha sighed, turning on her side to curl into Rio's embrace.</p><p>"My sister and her rag-tag crew."</p><p>"What, she got a bunch of kids?"</p><p>"Nope. Just... Associates. Friends, in a way. Mostly folks with troubled pasts that she sort of helps out."</p><p>"Oh. She sounds nice."</p><p>"She is, really. Val took care of me a lot when we were kids. She was 15 when I was born, so she was almost like a really young mom sometimes. Our mother... Well, she had stuff she preferred over raising kids, and she had some really strict ideas about parenting when she bothered to try."</p><p>"I'm really sorry," Rio said, stroking Agatha's hair.</p><p>"Nothing to be done about it now. Anyway, Val... She's taken care of me a lot. She's really a good sister."</p><p>"I bet. Must be nice being close to a sibling. I only see my sister, like, twice a year."</p><p>"You have a sister?" Agatha asked.</p><p>"Yup. Twin sister. Lenny. We got split up in the system when we were pretty young and didn't reconnect properly until a few years ago. We get along, but she lives all the way across the country. Last time I saw her was six months ago. Went to meet my niece for the first time."</p><p>Rio pulled their phone out and tapped around a bit, then turned it to show Agatha. There on the screen was a picture of Rio with someone who looked almost exactly like them, differentiated only by clothes and haircut. The two were crouched side by side under a tree, maybe in a park somewhere, and Rio's sister was helping a tiny, dark-haired toddler stand just in front of her.</p><p>"Adorable," Agatha said, and she meant it.</p><p>"Yeah. That's most of the family I got, Lenny and her wife and baby. There're a few cousins out there, but we're not as in touch."</p><p>"I only have Mother and Val," Agatha shrugged.<br/>
"Val and I don't even know who our fathers are."</p><p>"Rough. Well, you got me now too. I mean, I know I'm not family, but I... I care about you."</p><p>Agatha burrowed further into Rio's embrace.</p><p>"I care about you too," she whispered.</p><p>For a long time they lay there in quiet, simply holding each other. It was Rio who finally spoke.</p><p>"Thanks for inviting me to Thanksgiving," they said.</p><p>"Thanks for agreeing to be there."</p><p>More silence passed between them, and Agatha felt herself growing dozy.</p><p>"Wanna take a nap with me?" she asked.</p><p>A laugh rumbled in Rio's chest, and they kissed the crown of Agatha's head.</p><p>"I would like nothing more."</p><p>"Good. Because I don't intend letting you go for a while."</p><p>"Mmm. Thank goodness it's Saturday."</p><p>"Yes," Agatha purred, "and tonight we have this place all to ourselves once Jen goes out. You gonna stay the night?"</p><p>"Only if that's okay with you."</p><p>"More than okay. Did you bring your shot and everything?"</p><p>"Meds," Rio yawned, gesturing vaguely to a knapsack at the foot of the bed, "mm-hmm."</p><p>"Sweet dreams."</p><p>"Oh, always with you."</p><p>So they slept for three hours, waking when hunger grabbed both of them.</p><p>"Leftover spaghetti and meatballs sound good?" Agatha asked, enjoying simply lounging in Rio's arms.</p><p>"Sounds amazing, sweetheart. You're amazing."</p><p>Blushing, Agatha kissed Rio.</p><p>"You're too sweet to me, pretty boy."</p><p>"Well, you deserve someone being sweet to you."</p><p>"Do I?"</p><p>"Yup. Definitely."</p><p>When they left the bedroom, they found that Jen in the kitchen, already heating up a portion of the leftovers for herself. In the end, they all sat down and ate together and had some conversation which led to an interesting connection being made.</p><p>"Wait, is it Alice Wu-Gulliver you're seeing?" Rio asked when Jen brought up her plans for later.</p><p>"It is," Jen nodded.<br/>
"Met her at the club the same night you and Agatha met."</p><p>"Great! Aw, that's fantastic!"</p><p>Turning to Agatha, Rio grinned.</p><p>"Alice is an old pal, and the artist who's done most of my tattoos. Tellin' ya, your buddy Jen here couldn't've landed a sweeter person."</p><p>"Well, I'm sure Alice is wonderful," Agatha said, "but I beg to differ on the idea of no sweeter person."</p><p>Agatha punctuated the remark with a kiss to Rio's shoulder, and Jen made a fake retching sound as she went to rinse her plate.</p><p>"You two are do lovey-dovey together it sickens me, but in the best way," she muttered.</p><p>"I bet you're just as lovey with Alice," Agatha pointed out, "since I've seen how you are when you're dating someone."</p><p>"Oh, please, I am cool and calm and collected when dating. No pining, no clinging..."</p><p>"A likely story, Kale."</p><p>Jen went off to her room, grumbling good-naturedly, and Agatha giggled. Rio, quietly watching the whole exchange, simply smiled.</p><p>"You and Jen are good pals," they said.</p><p>"Well, we've known each other since college. We even had a bit of a thing when we were both 17."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>Agatha, realizing the casualness of her revelation, instinctively scooted her chair slightly away.</p><p>"It was just hook-ups, and it only happened three times. We don't... We would never..."</p><p>"Hey," Rio said softly, "I get it. You don't have to defend stuff to me or... Christ, Agatha, you're shaking like you saw a ghost."</p><p>Rio turned in their chair as if to touch her arm, and Agatha flinched back so hard she nearly fell on the floor.</p><p>"Please, I'm sorry if..."</p><p>"It's okay, Agatha. Hey, I'm not upset or anything. Don't be afraid, okay? C'mere if you want?"</p><p>Scooting their chair back, Rio opened their arms and, eventually Agatha moved to sit on their lap.</p><p>"Don't be scared, please?" they murmured, holding her hand.</p><p>"I just don't want you angry at me."</p><p>"Why would I be?"</p><p>"Because I... I dunno."</p><p>Rio kissed her cheek.</p><p>"Agatha, I'm not mad at you for anything, okay? Especially for stuff that happened well before we knew each other."</p><p>"Sorry. I'm just... I'm sorry."</p><p>"Nothing to be sorry for. Wanna finish eating and then we can do something fun?"</p><p>"Like what?"</p><p>"Anything you want, <em>querida</em>."</p><p>"Could we just go snuggle on the couch and maybe watch a movie?"</p><p>"Yeah, of course. We can do anything and everything you want to do."</p><p>"And you're honestly not angry?"</p><p>"Not at all. I'm worried 'cause there's someone out in the world who hurt you so bad and made you afraid, but I'm not angry at you, or inclined to do you any harm."</p><p>"I... You're sweet."</p><p>"So are you," Rio said, one hand gently rubbing Agatha's back.</p><p>"I'm only sweet with you."</p><p>"Yeah? Ah, I bet that's not true. Even if it is, well, I'm just glad I get to know how sweet you can be. Feels like an honor if I'm the main one. Like I got a treasure or something."</p><p>"You <u>are</u> a treasure, Rio Vidal."</p><p>"So are you, Agatha Harkness. So are you."</p>

<p>"I look okay?" </p><p>Rio was in the doorway, shifting weight foot to foot, basically looking incredibly nervous. Agatha simply smiled and went to them, taking their hands.</p><p>"You look wonderful," she said.</p><p>"Just I... Do you think the sweater is too much?"</p><p>"Darling, it's beautiful. You're beautiful."</p><p>Blushing, Rio pulled Agatha into a quick hug.</p><p>"You're beautiful, sweetheart."</p><p>"Ugh, oh no, we're both too beautiful," Agatha teased, "so I guess we better just stay home and keep all this beauty to ourselves, huh?"</p><p>"We could," Rio said, "but Jen is letting us borrow her car, and didn't you say that's a miracle?"</p><p>"Hmm. Yeah. Wouldn't wanna waste the chance."</p><p>Agatha had driven Jen to the airport three days before, only agreeing in exchange for the use of the car. It was not that Agatha was planning a lot of getting around over the Thanksgiving holidays—if she had her way she would be shut up in her bedroom with Rio until it was time to go pick up Jen from the return flight. Still, having the car would save on rideshares if they did have to get anywhere.</p><p>"Guess we better get going, huh?" Rio said</p><p>Agatha took their hand and pulled them over toward the bed.</p><p>"We have a little time. Come and warm me up a bit? I've been so cold without you for a whole week."</p><p>"I'm sorry, babe. You know things got busy and..."</p><p>"It's okay," Agatha said, and gently pushed Rio back to sit on the bed before straddling their lap.</p><p>"Babe..."</p><p>"It's okay. Just hold me a little while. I missed you so much."</p><p>"I missed you too," Rio said.</p><p>"My poor, pretty boy. All tired from working so hard. Shh, it's okay. Oh, you're so warm."</p><p>"Kiss?" Rio asked, tilting their head back.</p><p>Agatha kissed them hard, wanting things to move on, wanting them to take her. It had only been a week apart with barely even time for calls or texts, but it had been a full week. She needed them. When Rio slumped back across the bed, Agatha followed, resting on top of them.</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p>"Hnn?"</p><p>"Make love to me?"</p><p>"You sure you want to? I mean..."</p><p>"We don't have to if you don't want, but..."</p><p>It seemed that was enough inducement for Rio, who tightened their one-armed grip around Agatha's waist and flipped them so that Agatha was on her back.</p><p>"I want to," Rio murmured, "so bad."</p><p>"Then do it. Please?"</p><p>With a little smirk, Rio reached down and unfastened their slacks.</p><p>"You want me inside you?" they purred.</p><p>"Oh, God, yes."</p><p>"Mmm. No God. Just me."</p><p>Agatha felt the head of the cock pressing at the crotch of her panties and she whimpered, hips bumping up. There was the warmth of Rio's hand on her thigh, and she felt them tug the little bit of impeding fabric to the side just before the warm bluntness of the cock prodded her clit, drawing a gasp from her.</p><p>"W-which one?" she asked.</p><p>Rio chuckled, kissing the side of her neck.</p><p>"Little Rio," the said.</p><p>Agatha moaned. That was the one she had decided already that she liked best. It just felt right; not too much, not too little. As it slid into her, she sighed, head falling back.</p><p>"Oh, fuck."</p><p>Everything was quick, hard, short strokes from Rio and Agatha pressing up to meet them, hands gripping Rio's sweater.</p><p>"Good girl," Rio whispered, "taking me just right."</p><p>"Rio.... Oh, fuck, please..."</p><p>"I gotcha, sweetheart. I... I gotcha."</p><p>"You feel so good."</p><p>"So do you. Fuck."</p><p>"Rio, please, I... Please?"</p><p>Agatha was not entirely certain what she was asking for, but Rio kissed her and smiled.</p><p>"Anything you want, <em>querida</em>. I'll do anything for you."</p><p>It was good and sweet and wonderful and Agatha felt the tell-tale build of heat and pressure in her belly, and then she came, moaning, clinging tight to Rio as if otherwise she might drift away. Rio kept moving, driving in rough, grunting softly with each thrust until they too were undone and went still and limp on top of Agatha a moment. When they had recovered a little, they eased the cock out gently.</p><p>"I love you," Agatha whispered.</p><p>Instantly, she hated herself. It was so soon, only a month and a half since they met. She had really fucked up now, getting to clingy, moving too fast...</p><p>"I love you too," Rio said, and nuzzled their nose against Agatha's.</p><p>"You mean it?"</p><p>"Hell yeah. Do you?"</p><p>"Yeah. Yeah, I do. I love you."</p><p>"I love you. Fuck, Agatha, I love you so much."</p><p>Rio moved off of her but stayed, as ever, close at her side, and kissed her as if she were sacred. </p><p>"I'm sorry if this is sudden, or..." Agatha started.</p><p>"Nothing to be sorry for," Rio assured her.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Agatha, I've been holding back from admitting I love you since the second week we knew each other. I'm just glad it's out there now."</p><p>"And you really do love me? You're not just saying it?"</p><p>"Agatha, I love you. I adore you. Whatever we are, whatever this is, I can't pretend there's no love in it."</p><p>Another kiss, beautiful, delicate... And then Agatha's phone blared an alarm, jolting them apart.</p><p>"Fuck," Agatha winced.</p><p>"Shit. Guess we gotta head out?"</p><p>"Well, that's my 'Hey, we should leave in 15 minutes alarm,' so we have a little time."</p><p>"Okay. Good. Good."</p><p>For a few more priceless moments they were simply together, face to face, brow to brow, sharing breath. Then Rio smirked and sat up.</p><p>"Guess we oughta sort of collect ourselves and get going."</p><p>Sighing, Agatha sat up.</p><p>"That would be the smart and reasonable thing..."</p><p>"Well, good thing we're both wicked smart. As to reasonable..."</p><p>"Don't push your luck, Vidal."</p><p>"Who, me?" Rio laughed, then kissed Agatha again.<br/>"We better get a move on, mi amor."</p><p>The words sent a shiver through Agatha, and there was a rush of happiness in her stronger than any she had felt in years.</p><p>By the time they had freshened up and headed to the car, Agatha felt positively ecstatic. She had really thought for a few years now that she was unlovable, that she would never find peace and joy with someone, and yet here was Rio, loving her. Here was Rio holding her hand as they walked together, telling her how beautiful she looked, smiling and kissing her cheek just before getting in the car, and watching her with adoring eyes the whole drive over to Val's.</p><p><em>'I don't know if or how I deserve all this,'</em> she thought, <em>'but my God I hope it lasts.'</em></p><p>By the time they made it across town, parked the car, and were heading up to Val's townhouse, Agatha had calmed slightly, only because she was worried about how her sister would act toward Rio.</p><p>"Just remember," she said, squeezing Rio's hand, "Val means well. She's just super protective of me."</p><p>"I get it," Rio said  "'cause I feel super protective of you too."</p><p>"Well, I just... I don't want her to scare you off."</p><p>"Oh, sweetheart, at this point it would take a lot to scare me off."</p><p>At the door, Rio squeezed Agatha's hand.</p><p>"I love you," they said.</p><p>"I love you too," Agatha said, turning to kiss them just as...</p><p>"Aggie! Hey, little sister! Oh, and this must be Rio!"</p><p>Jerking back, Agatha turned and saw her sister grinning like someone who just won the lottery.</p><p>"Hi, Val. Rio, Valentina. Val, Rio. There, introductions made. Now, when do we eat?"</p><p>Val ushered the both of them into the house, an arm around each so that she was between them.</p><p>"So, Rio, you're seeing my baby sister?" Val gushed.</p><p>"Y-yes ma'am. Just over a month now."</p><p>"Oh, please, call me Countess de Fontaine. Or Lady de Fontaine. Whatever's more comfortable."</p><p>Rio looked over at Agatha, their face the picture of utter bafflement.</p><p>"Third husband shenanigans," Agatha shrugged, and Val threw back her head with laughter.</p><p>"How do you think I afford this place?" she said.</p><p>Guiding them along to the kitchen, Val at last stepped out from between them and smiled.</p><p>"Well, look at you two, just the picture of happiness."</p><p>Agatha stepped closer to Rio and grabbed their hand. Val had that look in her eyes: there was possibly an inquisition coming.</p><p>"So, Rio," Val said, "what is it you do?"</p><p>"Uhm, I'm a funeral director, m... Lady de Fontaine."</p><p>"Ah! Some of my friends work in funerals as well."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Yes, you'll probably meet a couple of them later. Well, Rio, how old are you?"</p><p>"28, Lady de Fontaine. I'll be 29 next August."</p><p>"Good, good. And aside from funeral direction and dating my baby sister, what do you do?"</p><p>"Uhm, I DJ at clubs on the weekends. That's actually how I met Agatha."</p><p>"I see. I wasn't aware Agatha was inclined to go out to clubs."</p><p>"It was one time," Agatha cut in, "because Jen dragged me along."</p><p>"How is Jennifer?" Val asked, and Agatha heard Rio give an audible sigh of relief.</p><p>"She's great. Off visiting family for the holiday."</p><p>"How lovely. Well, Rio, why don't you go along through there and mingle with the other guests? I need to talk to Agatha in private for a moment."</p><p>Rio looked in the direction Val was pointing, then back to Val, nodding and almost bowing.</p><p>"Of course, Lady de Fontaine," they rumbled, and then backed reverently out of the kitchen.</p><p>As soon as Rio's hurried footsteps had receded into the distance, Agatha shook her head and covered her face with her hands.</p><p>"Oh my God, Val."</p><p>"What? I need to keep an eye on my precious baby sister's social life."</p><p>"I won't <u>have</u> a social life if you scare people off!"</p><p>"Maybe keeping people on edge is a good thing, Agatha. After all, the last person you dated..."</p><p>"That was different! I was barely out of college when I met her and I hadn't gone to therapy for my mommy issues and..."</p><p>"And you ended up in a relationship with someone over 20 years your senior who abused you and treated you like shit! I want to protect you, Agatha..."</p><p>"And I want <u>you</u> to acknowledge that everything with Hela was over with two years ago and I'm not the naïve girl I was!"</p><p>Closing her eyes, Agatha took a deep breath.</p><p>"Rio is very kind and sweet and gentle, Val. They treat me with respect, they're genuinely concerned for my happiness..."</p><p>"You've known them a month."</p><p>"Yes, and in that month I've been happier and more cared for than I've ever imagined being. There's no attempt from them to control me, no attempt to keep me from living my life. All Rio wants is for me to be happy."</p><p>"All right," Val said, nodding, "I'll buy that they're not hurting you. But have you checked up on things at all? Their background, family..."</p><p>"I know what they've told me. Their parents died when they were two and a half, and they mostly grew up in foster care after that. They have a twin sister out in California."</p><p>"And financially?"</p><p>"Oh my <u>God</u>, Val..."</p><p>"Well, Aggie, you come into your trust fund next year. Do you really want to risk..."</p><p>"Rio does very well for themself, Val, but even if they didn't, I wouldn't care. I would give them every spare penny I have, and then I would drain my trust account for them."</p><p>"Have they been asking you for money?"</p><p>"No, and they wouldn't have to. I would just give it anyway."</p><p>"Agatha..."</p><p>"Valentina."</p><p>Suddenly, Val's expression softened and she stepped forward to envelope Agatha in a tight hug.</p><p>"I just want to protect you."</p><p>"I know, Val."</p><p>"I wish I had protected you better when you were little."</p><p>"You barely got out of Mother's house alive, Val, and you were still so young when I was born. You did what you could, when you could."</p><p>"I tried. I really tried."</p><p>"I know you did. Is something burning?"</p><p>Val spun out of the hug, then rushed to the oven.</p><p>"My apple pistachio pie!"</p><p>Agatha took the opportunity to slip away while Val was distracted, wanting to hunt down Rio. She found them quickly enough, standing just inside the drawing room, chatting quite amiably with some of the other guests. Sidling up, she patted their back.</p><p>"Hey there, stranger."</p><p>Rio turned to her, smiling.</p><p>"Agatha! Hey, ya know, it's a small world. Do you know Yelena and Bob?"</p><p>Agatha looked at the two people Rio had been speaking with and nodded.</p><p>"I believe we met here last year."</p><p>"Hi," Bob said, and Yelena just nodded.</p><p>"They both work for me!" Rio said.</p><p>"You're dating the boss?" Yelena asked Agatha.</p><p>"Well, yes I am."</p><p>The blonde moved a step closer to Agatha, expression perfectly neutral.</p><p>"Be good to them."</p><p>Agatha felt distinctly as if she were being backed into a corner.</p><p>"I... I will. I am!"</p><p>"Back off a little, Yelena," Rio said."Agatha's great."</p><p>"Yes, well, you deserve the best."</p><p>Turning, Yelena strode over and struck up conversation with a tall young woman who seemed vaguely familiar to Agatha.</p><p>"Rio's a great boss," Bob smiled.</p><p>"I'll bet they are," Agatha said.</p><p>"Oh yeah. They... Not a lot of people would give a guy like me a chance, but Rio's been real supportive. It's great."</p><p>"Bob's a hard worker," Rio said.</p><p>They chatted a while longer before Bob wandered vaguely over to talk to Val's security leads, Buck and Sam, who were in the corner practically canoodling. A scrawny boy with dark, wildly curly hair approached in Bob's wake, smiling and extending a hand to Agatha.</p><p>"Hey," he said, "remember me?"</p><p>"Uh," Agatha said, shaking his hand, "maybe?"</p><p>"William Kaplan. I'm Wanda's cousin? We met at the Seder you came to earlier this year."</p><p>"Oh! Oh, yes, I remember. You're studying to be a teacher, right?"</p><p>"Yup."</p><p>"Wonderful. Well, William, I'd like you to meet Rio. Rio, William's cousin Wanda is just about one of my dearest friends."</p><p>William, in turn, waved over a hulking young man whom he introduced as his boyfriend, and there was a bit of friendly chitchat before Val appeared, having managed to fully change her clothes and style her hair. She looked, in Agatha's frank opinion, more like she was going to a gala than hosting a slightly overcrowded Thanksgiving dinner.</p><p>"If everyone would like to accompany me to the formal dining room," she intoned, solemn as a priest.</p><p>What followed was less an orderly procession than a mad dash, and the table, groaning under the weight of the massive feast laid out on top, was soon surrounded by hungry people laughing, talking, passing things. Agatha stole little glances at Rio throughout the meal, and she was pleased. They seemed to belong here, to fit right in with all of Val's strays. Once or twice they looked at her, grinning, and then they would inevitably grab her hand under the table and squeeze gently.</p><p>After the meal was over, everyone sort of hung around a bit, helping to put things away and clean up. Agatha and Rio found themselves up to their elbows in dishes, scrubbing and rinsing the little remnants of food away, loading up the dishwasher, then unloading it with help from Yelena and her girlfriend Kate before starting in on another load of dishes. The whole time they worked, they talked and laughed, hands brushing now and then as they passed a plate or reached for a sponge.</p><p>"I really like your sister," Rio said at one point.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah. I can tell she really cares about you a lot, and that she must be a really great person."</p><p>"Well, Val is... Val."</p><p>At last, the dishes were mostly tackled, and Val stepped up behind them, a gentle hand on each of their backs.</p><p>"Well, kids, all done for another year."</p><p>Agatha turned and hugged her sister.</p><p>"Thanks for having us, Val."</p><p>"Hey, what's family for?"</p><p>NIght was well fallen as they left the townhouse, and Rio kept an arm tight around Agatha's shoulders while they walked to the car.</p><p>"Hey," they said, stopping just short of the car.</p><p>Agatha turned to them, suddenly nervous.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>Rio smirked and pulled her close.</p><p>"I love you, <em>querida</em>."</p><p>With a happy sigh, Agatha kissed them.</p><p>"I love you too," she said.</p><p>"Good. Now, let's get home and show each other how in love we are."</p>

<p>"It's nearly Christmas. What should I get you?"</p><p>Agatha finished up washing her face and moved back from the sink, grabbing up her towel.</p><p>"You don't need to get me anything, Rio."</p><p>"I want to, though. Our first Christmas together, I'd like to get you just a little something. At least I'd like to do something for you."</p><p>Rio was busily preparing an injection, and Agatha watched, the towel draped around her neck.</p><p>"If you want to do something for me, you could teach me how to give you the shots," she said.</p><p>"I can do it okay."</p><p>"Of course, but what if I want to help you? Or what if someday you have a really bad flare-up and need the help?"</p><p>"Agatha, I appreciate that you wanna help. I don't even need the shots all the time and anyway I don't want... Well, I don't want you to feel like you've gotta play nursemaid or something."</p><p>"I wouldn't be playing nursemaid," Agatha said.<br/>
"I'd be a loving girlfriend."</p><p>The whole time they spoke, Rio had kept up the preparations, and now they injected the medication, then tossed the syringe in the sharps container.</p><p>"You wanna help me?" they asked.</p><p>"I do. Very much."</p><p>"Then just keep being my sweet girl. Keep taking care of me with your gentle touches and your soft kisses."</p><p>"I just want to feel really useful."</p><p>"You are, Agatha. You're always helping me in one way or another. Even just being around me, you're useful. You make me happy. Make my life feel complete."</p><p>Rio put away their kit then moved to embrace Agatha.</p><p>"I'll think about it, okay? Promise."</p><p>"I just wanna help you," Agatha said, and she hated that she felt tears welling in her eyes.</p><p>"You can help me tonight, okay?"</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"My back feels all tight. Rub it for me?"</p><p>"Yeah! Yeah, I can definitely do that."</p><p>"Good girl."</p><p>Together they went to bed, and Rio sat down on the edge.</p><p>"Lotion's right there," they said, pointing to a bottle on the nightstand as they whipped off their shirt.</p><p>As they lay belly down in the middle of their bed, Agatha felt her heart ache at the sight of their back. It bore the marks of so much pain, and she wished she could permanently take away the hurt that lingered. Squeezing a bit of lotion into her right hand, she set the bottle back in place and then knelt on the edge of the bed.</p><p>"Any particular spot?" she asked, rubbing her hands lightly together to warm the lotion.</p><p>"Just all over."</p><p>Nodding, she moved to straddle Rio, sitting on their ass. They laughed.</p><p>"You're gonna get me turned on, babe."</p><p>"Should I move?"</p><p>"Please stay."</p><p>"Okay. I mean, this really is a good place to sit. Nice, firm cushion."</p><p>Rio laughed again, moving their hips a bit.</p><p>"Yeah? You like sittin' there?"</p><p>"I like sitting on any part of you," Agatha shrugged.</p><p>"Mmm. Gonna have to get you to sit on my face some... Aahhh, babe, that feels good..."</p><p>Rio groaned when Agatha went carefully to work on the tightened skin and tense muscles.</p><p>"Too hard?" Agatha asked, not wanting to hurt Rio.</p><p>"No, sweetheart. You're perfect."</p><p>Agatha blushed and went on. She kept her hands moving, slowly and evenly, over Rio's back, mesmerized by the way the curves and swirls of the vines that made up Rio's intricate back tattoo seemed to ripple with the pressure. The work carried on from a little above the base of the spine to up near the shoulders, meeting and merging with the half sleeves on either arm. It was a very fine piece.</p><p>The longer she rubbed and pushed, the more Agatha felt a little sad. She knew little so far of the exact cause of Rio's injuries, of the precise incidents of abuse, but she knew they had all happened when Rio was very young. In the two and a half months they had been seeing each other, she had seen one photo of a very small Rio.</p><p>"I was 'bout two there," Rio had muttered, "so Dad and Mom were still alive. This is the only picture I got from before everything."</p><p>It sickened Agatha to think that anyone could harm a child, especially such a small, defenseless one. Rio's parents, she knew, had died when Rio and Lenny were two and a half. The twins had gone first to the care of an older cousin who had abused them, causing Rio's first massive injuries, to the legs and genitals, and then lost each other in the foster system for many years. Rio had ended up further injured in their second non-familial foster home—that was the source of most of the back scarring.</p><p>Agatha had very violent thoughts about what she hoped might happen, or perhaps had happened, to the people who harmed Rio.</p><p>Agatha tried to pull her mind back from all of that, but it simply jumped track to her own childhood abuse. Mother had been cruel, withholding affection and attention endlessly, and more often than not dishing out pain, physical or emotional, when she did deign to notice Agatha. There had been nights spent alone and frightened as a tiny child when Mother went out to her action meetings without bothering to call Val or hire a sitter. Then there were all the times Agatha had been dragged along to consciousness raising meetings or endless Womyn Power gatherings, left to amuse herself in some out of the way corner or wander some muddy field naked because "Your body is not shameful! It is a weapon against the system!"</p><p>She could not imagine how awful it would have been if things had escalated to the level of what Rio went through.</p><p>"Rio?" Agatha said.</p><p>"Hnn?" Rio rumbled.</p><p>"I... I wish..."</p><p>There were so many things she wanted to say.</p><p><em>'I wish we had been friends as children. I wish we could have protected each other. I wish I could find everyone who hurt you and inflict that pain on them.'</em></p><p>But all those words, she realized, could be boiled down together to a short, easy phrase. Letting her hands slide up to Rio's shoulders and down their upper arms a bit, she leaned over and kissed the back of their neck.</p><p>"I love you," she murmured against their skin.</p>

<p>Agatha fumbled the drawer open and grabbed a clean spoon just as Rio entered the kitchen.</p><p>"Here," she said, spooning up a little sauce, "taste this."</p><p>Rio took the spoon, sniffed curiously, blew on the sauce briefly to cool it, then ate it.</p><p>"Shit," they said, "that is really, really good."</p><p>"You don't think it needs anything?"</p><p>"I don't think so, but that's up to you really. You're the cook."</p><p>"Oh, please, I can make this and scramble eggs."</p><p>Grinning, Rio went to the sink to wash the spoon.</p><p>"I said cook, Agatha, not chef. Anyway, you're better in a kitchen than you think."</p><p>"You're just saying that because of last week."</p><p>They had spent the prior weekend at Rio's place and had perhaps, at one point, engaged in some less than food safe activities at one point on the kitchen counter. Well, sort of on the counter. Agatha had been sitting on the counter, Rio had been sitting on a low chair...</p><p>It had been a very good time, really.</p><p>Rio had gone over now and was getting plates down from the cabinet.</p><p>"Oh, we'll need four tonight," Agatha said.<br/>"Jen's finally bringing Alice here for dinner."</p><p>"Ah, cool. Think they'll stay here all night, or..."</p><p>"Jen informed me that they'll be heading over to Alice's to sleep, so you and I have the place to ourselves."</p><p>"Sweet! Don't get me wrong, Jen is cool and Alice is one of my best friends, but I... Well, I like when..."</p><p>"When it's just us?" Agatha provided.</p><p>"Yeah," Rio said, and blushed.</p><p>"You are just the sweetest, Rio Vidal."</p><p>"I... Well, you... I can be sweet with you. Like, all the time."</p><p>Turning off the burners and moving things back on the stove, Agatha turned and went to hug Rio.</p><p>"I think you're just a big softie."</p><p>"Only for you," Rio reiterated, and kissed Agatha.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha let her mind wander. She could imagine, here in Rio's arms, that this was some place they were living together. Home. She could imagine they would last as a couple, maybe move in together, get married, and then every evening could be this wonderful.</p><p>Just for a moment, she did not feel she was waiting for the other shoe to drop in some way.</p><p>At last leaving the embrace, Agatha went and finished preparing the food while Rio finished setting the table. Everything was just in readiness when the door of the apartment opened and Jen entered, followed by Alice.</p><p>"Hey," Jen called, "what smells so good?"</p><p>"Just my classic spaghetti and meatballs," Agatha said.</p><p>"Nice!"</p><p>As Jen and Alice entered the kitchen, Rio went and offered Alice a one-armed hug and, just for a fleeting instant, Agatha felt a stab of jealousy. The pang passed quickly; Rio had often spoken of their strong friendship with Alice, and there was no indication of it being anything else. Still, as everyone sat down to eat, Agatha scooted her chair closer to Rio's, keeping a hand on their thigh through most of the meal.</p><p>"So, Rio," Alice said at one point, "you still considering that new piece we talked about last week?"</p><p>"Uhm, yeah. Thinkin' about it."</p><p>"Cool, cool. I think it'll go really well with everything else you've got."</p><p>"Hope so," Rio said, keeping their head down and blushing noticeably.</p><p>"Oh, you're thinking of getting a new tattoo?" Agatha asked, trying to keep her tone neutral.</p><p>She did not mind at all the idea of Rio getting more tattoos, but she was curious now.</p><p>"I am, yeah," Rio nodded.</p><p>"Adding to your sleeves or the back or..."</p><p>"Uhm, I was thinking sort of mid chest this time. Still something pretty on theme though. Flowers."</p><p>"Neat."</p><p>"Yeah. I... I, uhm, was thinking azaleas."</p><p>"Oh, those are my favorite!" Agatha rushed, and Rio smiled at her.</p><p>"Exactly," Rio said, and smirked a little.</p><p>Agatha felt her face go hot, and oh, Jen was never going to let her live down blushing like this. Sure enough...</p><p>"Rio, I gotta thank you," Jen said.</p><p>"Oh? What'd I do?"</p><p>"It's just that I haven't seen Agatha this delightfully flustered so often in a long time."</p><p>"Ah, ya know," Rio shrugged, "I have an effect on her. But then, she has an effect on me too."</p><p>As Rio spoke, they touched Agatha's hand on their thigh, patting gently.</p><p>When the meal was done, Jen and Alice headed out in a hurry, leaving Agatha and Rio to clean up.</p><p>"Hey, so," Rio sighed, setting a plate in the drain rack and taking the next to rinse, "you got big plans for Christmas day?"</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>"Not really. Probably go over to Val's a little while in the morning for gift exchange, then just bum around here. I was hoping I might be able to see you."</p><p>"Ah, I... I'm free most of the day. Only I was just wondering if maybe you might wanna come to Christmas dinner with me an' my mom."</p><p>"Your..."</p><p>"Foster mom, I mean. But she's the best mom I ever had since I was little."</p><p>"I... Are you sure you want me to go along?"</p><p>"Yeah, definitely! Mom actually said I oughta ask. I've told her a lot about you, and she's really been wanting to meet you."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yup. Course, you don't have to go if you don't want. I just think it could be a good time. You'd like Mom; she kooky, but she's really nice."</p><p>"Well, I wouldn't want to intrude."</p><p>"Wouldn't be an intrusion, sweetheart. I mean, you invited me to Thanksgiving at your sister's place. Was I intruding?"</p><p>"No! No, Val always has a lot of people around and she never really minds one more. She's basically Queen Hospitality when it comes to holiday stuff."</p><p>"Yeah, well, Mom's basically the same in a lot of ways. Like I say, if you don't wanna go, I get it."</p><p>"I want to, I just... What if... Well, what if your mom doesn't think I'm good enough for you?"</p><p>With a little grunt, Rio reached over and turned off the tap.</p><p>"Why would she think that, Agatha?"</p><p>"Because I'm... You deserve someone..."</p><p>"I want you. You're way better than I ever thought I could get. Maybe I'm not good enough for <u>you</u>."</p><p>"Please don't say that. You're wonderful. I... Please, don't be angry with me."</p><p>Rio turned and held their arms open. Immediately, Agatha accepted the embrace.</p><p>"I'm not angry," Rio whispered against her hair.<br/>"All I want is for you to be happy."</p><p>"I just never want to disappoint you."</p><p>"You never could, my sweet. Never."</p><p>"I want to be what you need."</p><p>"You're everything I could ever need or want and more, Agatha. Please, please try to believe that."</p><p>After a few quiet moments, Rio pulled back slightly.</p><p>"Wanna just got to bed and leave the last few dishes for the morning?" they asked.</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, and Rio stroked her hair.</p><p>"C'mon," they said, switching off the light over the sink.</p><p>In Agatha's room, Rio stopped at the dresser, carefully taking off their watch and leaving it next to Agatha's jewelry box. Turning, they rolled their shoulders and yawned before padding over to the bed, stripping down to their underwear as they went. Their shirt and jeans draped over the footboard, they crawled into bed and stretched, watching Agatha undress.</p><p>"Fuck, you're beautiful," they said.</p><p>Once more, Agatha felt herself blushing, and as she stepped near the bed, Rio sat up on the edge and reached for her hand.</p><p>"I love you," they said, and kissed her palm.</p><p>When Agatha joined them in the bed, they snuggled up close and sighed.</p><p>"Wish I could spend every night like this the rest of my life."</p><p>"Spend it how?" Agatha asked.</p><p>"Like this. Curled up in a nice, cozy bed with the most beautiful woman I know."</p><p>Again Agatha blushed, and she was halfway to being concerned it was some medical condition, but then decided not to worry so much and snuggled down under the blankets with Rio.</p><p>"You can spend however many nights you want with me," she said.</p><p>"Good, 'cause like I said, I want it to be the rest of 'em. All the rest of my nights forever."</p><p>"I really do love you, Rio. Just an absurd amount."</p><p>"I love you too, Agatha. More than anything."</p>

<p>"Just don't be nervous."</p><p>"Well now I have to be nervous," Agatha teased.</p><p>For an instant, Rio looked deeply concerned, but then they smiled.</p><p>"Woman, you'll be the death of me."</p><p>"Hardly think that's possible."</p><p>"Well, maybe just a little death," Rio said, and pulled Agatha into an embrace.</p><p>"Good thing we're the only ones in this elevator," Agatha whispered.</p><p>"Oh yeah? Why's that?"</p><p>"Means I can do this."</p><p>Agatha shifted her hips gently forward, putting the slightest pressure on the bulge in Rio's jeans.</p><p>"Fuck, Agatha..."</p><p>"That's what I'm hoping you'll do later tonight."</p><p>"Oh, definitely."</p><p>The elevator jerked to a halt, doors sliding smoothly open. Rio pressed a quick kiss to Agatha's lips, then took her hand and led her out into the corridor.</p><p>"Like I said, don't be nervous. At the same time, maybe brace for impact."</p><p>"Huh?" Agatha gulped.</p><p>"Mom's a hugger. If she likes you on sight, and I bet she will, she's liable to just glom on and squeeze the air out of ya."</p><p>"Noted."</p><p>Together they trudged, hand in hand, to the furthest door. Rio knocked, and then it was a matter of waiting.</p><p>Waiting and, in Agatha's case, internally panicking. What if she was not good enough? What if Rio's mom could just look at her and see what a fuck-up she was? What if...?</p><p>The apartment door slowly opened, revealing a petite older woman with wild, curly salt-and-pepper hair and the fashion sense of some sort of stereotypical fortune teller. She seemed, at first, to be wearing a short white fur stole, but a closer look revealed that a lean white cat was asleep, draped around the woman's neck.</p><p>"Rio, my dear!" the woman crowed, and grabbed Rio in a fierce hug that ended up, by virtue of tightly clasped hands, sweeping Agatha into the apartment as well.</p><p>"Hiya, Ma," Rio said.</p><p>"Oh, I've been so busy planning and preparing, all because I knew that this was going to be a very special Christmas dinner indeed."</p><p>Releasing Rio, the older woman at last made eye contact with Agatha.</p><p>"And you, my dear, must be my sweet Rio's beloved Agatha!"</p><p>Without any real warning, Agatha found herself hauled into a crushing, nigh-suffocating hug. It was not the worst thing, but it did wake the cat. The small white head raised, and for an instant Agatha felt the cat's cold little nose bump her own.</p><p>"Agatha, this is my foster mother, Lilia. Lilia, this is the best girl in the world, Agatha."</p><p>Rio's description made Agatha blush and raised happy tears in her eyes. Damn it, this relationship was making her sappy, and the wildest part was that she loved that.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha found herself turned loose, and Lilia smiled.</p><p>"Well, Agatha dear, Rio's told me so much about you."</p><p>The cat around Lilia's neck yawned, stretched, shifted to stand on her shoulder, then promptly leapt to the floor and began winding around Agatha's ankles, occasionally letting out a soft <em>mrrrrp</em>.</p><p>"It seems everyone is drawn to you," Lilia said.</p><p>"Oh, I... Well, I'm pretty good with cats," Agatha shrugged.</p><p>"This," Rio said, crouching for a moment to scoop the cat up, "is Alpine. Not sure what she's doing hanging out around here, though."</p><p>"Oh, Bucky left her with me until he gets back," Lilia said.</p><p>Agatha looked to Rio, full of questions.</p><p>"Bucky's another one of Lilia's kids," Rio said.</p><p>"He's spending this holiday season visiting his fiancé's family," Lilia explained, "and so I am cast in the role of pet-sitter. And why not? Suppose an old lesbian like myself ought to keep a cat or two around."</p><p>Leading the way into a cozy living room, Lilia pointed to a loveseat that had seen better days.</p><p>"Sit, kids, and let's talk a while."</p><p>Rio plopped happily down, Alpine stretching out on her lap, but Agatha hesitated, just for a moment.</p><p>"Please, dear," Lilia insisted, "make yourself at home."</p><p>Gently, Rio pulled Agatha down, then wrapped their arm protectively around her shoulders and kissed her cheek.</p><p>"You're safe here, babe," they murmured.</p><p>The warmth of their breath teased her ear, and Agatha felt the tiniest shiver roll through her.</p><p>Oh, as soon as she got them home...</p><p>"So, Agatha, you and Rio have been seeing each other for, what, two months now?" Lilia asked.</p><p>"Yes, ma'am. Two months. We... Well, perhaps we've moved a bit quickly..."</p><p>"Nonsense! Nothing's too quick when you're in love. You are in love, aren't you?"</p><p>Agatha let herself relax a bit more, and she smiled.</p><p>"Very much in love, ma'am."</p><p>"Please, you must feel free to call me Lilia."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Turning quickly, Lilia swept out of the room like an actress making a glorious exit from the stage.</p><p>"Sorry if Mom's a lot," Rio said.</p><p>"Oh, no, it... Well, she's very welcoming. I just don't want to mess anything up."</p><p>"You won't, <em>mi amor</em>. You never could."</p><p>When Lilia returned moments later, she was carrying an enormous silver tray all laid out with tea things. The pot did not match the cream pitcher or the sugar bowl, none of the cups seemed even vaguely similar, and nothing on the tray resembled the tray itself in style. Immediately Agatha was thrilled. The sight alone would absolutely kill the part of her mother that was a stuck-up conservative old money WASP hiding under the political lesbian separatist veneer.</p><p>She wondered if she should take a picture for the next time she visited the home.</p><p>"Here we are," Lilia said, "my own signature tea blend. Very fine stuff."</p><p>The cups were filled and handed 'round. Rio took cream and three sugars—they did love a sweet—but Agatha opted to take her tea as it was. After all, if this was a special blend, she wanted to get to know it.</p><p>It tasted distinctly like Rambeau brand Irish Breakfast tea with some cocoa nibs and rose hips in the mix, perhaps licorice root, and just a hint of...</p><p>"It's lavender," Lilia said, clearly having read the searching look on Agatha's face.</p><p>Ah, lavender. That fit.</p><p>"It's very good," Agatha said, and she meant that.</p><p>She might well have to see about obtaining some of this blend herself.</p><p>Alpine moved from Rio's lap to Agatha's and immediately made herself comfortable, curling into a little white lump and sighing happily.</p><p>"Well, no better judge of character than a cat," Lilia said.</p><p>"Oh, well, I... I just... As I said, I'm good with cats. Used to volunteer with a shelter during the summers when I was a teenager."</p><p>"How lovely! Have any pets of your own?"</p><p>"Not at the moment. The apartment I'm in right now doesn't allow them without a heinous deposit. If I could have a pet though, I think I'd like a cat. Or maybe a rabbit. My older sister had a rabbit when I was little, and I learned to help care for it."</p><p>"I see."</p><p>"I was... Well, I was homeschooled and didn't have a lot of friends my own age until I went to college when I was 15, so animals... Well, animals made up for some of the loneliness."</p><p>"15?"</p><p>Agatha nodded, sipping her tea.</p><p>"My mother was very insistent that I work as far as I could above my expected grade level," she explained, "and I'm a fast learner."</p><p>"Rio tells me you're a teacher."</p><p>"Yes. Adult education, specifically English as a second language."</p><p>"A wonderful pursuit, educating people."</p><p>"My Agatha's pretty wonderful all around," Rio said, kissing Agatha's cheek once more.</p><p>The softness of the contact seemed to blend with the warm, cozy atmosphere of the apartment and make Agatha at last begin to feel truly at ease.</p><p>When the tea was finished, Lilia carried everything away on the tray again, then called Rio and Agatha to the table for dinner.</p><p>"You're gonna love this," Rio said.<br/>"Ma always goes all out for Christmas dinner. All kinds of good stuff."</p><p>Rio spoke truthfully, because as soon as she stepped into the kitchen, Agatha felt overwhelmed at the sight of so much food ready and waiting. There was a little of everything, it seemed. The cuisine skewed heavily Italian as far as Agatha could tell—Sicilian, Rio had stressed to her—but she saw plenty of dishes that she associated with other cultures.</p><p>"Now, both of you sit," Lilia said, "and just dig right in."</p><p>"Don't worry too much about manners," Rio whispered to Agatha.</p><p>"Oh, no problem," Agatha nodded.<br/>"The second I laid eyes on all this deliciousness, manners went right out of my mind."</p><p>The meal was grand and filling and joyful, Rio and Lilia sharing old stories and laughing, but never shutting Agatha out of the conversation. She got a lot of useful information about what Rio had been like as a teenager—enough, at least, to make her aware that not much had changed.</p><p>"This one," Lilia cackled, clapping Rio on the shoulder, "has always been a cocky little creature."</p><p>Rio smirked, gnawing at a piece of <em>sfincione</em>.</p><p>"What can I say? I know my worth."</p><p>Agatha found herself hoping every Christmas in her future might be like this: a feast not only of food, but of love and humor and kindness.</p><p>They all ate until the table was groaning a little less from the weight of the food, but they were each starting to groan a little from being overstuffed. Rio scooted their chair back a little and sighed.</p><p>"Ma, ya did it again. Amazing dinner."</p><p>"It's one of the best meals I've ever had," Agatha agreed.</p><p>Lilia smiled, looking a little misty-eyed, and took each of them by the hand for a moment.</p><p>"Thank you, kids. You're too kind."</p><p>The sweet moment was only a little disrupted as Rio's phone buzzed loudly. They shook their head and moved to fish the device from their pocket.</p><p>"Sorry, Ma, I forgot to turn it off. I... Oh. Oh, holy... Wow! Merry Christmas to me!"</p><p>"What is it, dear?" Lilia asked.</p><p>"Message from Lenny. Guess what old bitch just kicked the bucket a week ago?"</p><p>Rio turned the phone to show Lilia, who clasped her hands together almost prayerfully.</p><p>"Oh, there is a God in heaven," the older woman said.</p><p>"Who died?" Agatha asked, rather amused by the overt pleasure on display.</p><p>"Ah, that cousin who had custody of me an' Lenny right after our parents died," Rio said, and flashed the screen of their phone toward Agatha for a moment.</p><p>It was only just a flicker, really, but her eyes managed to process that the person in the photo looked dreadfully familiar.</p><p>"Could... Could I see that again?" she asked, not really sure she should.</p><p>Rio turned the phone again, and Agatha studied the obituary filling the screen.</p><p>The eyes. The scowl. The name.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Feelings rushed in, good and bad, happy and horrified.</p><p>"Could... I'm sorry," Agatha said, "but Lilia, could I use your bathroom for a minute?"</p><p>"Of course, dear. Just down that little hall. The door in your left."</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>She stood and left the kitchen slowly, calmly, and headed along the hall. Once she was in the bathroom, door closed behind her, she lunged for the sink, feeling momentarily as if she might vomit.</p><p>She did not, but she caught sight if herself in the mirror and saw that she was pale enough in the moment to look a bit sick.</p><p>How? How was that person, that monster who had hurt Rio all those years ago...</p><p>How was it the same person who had almost destroyed Agatha's faith in relationships?</p><p>She must have seen it wrong, must have misread the name. Probably Rio's late cousin just looked an awful lot like Hela. That had to be it. Some sliver of the person's monstrous nature indelibly marked in their features, making them resemble other monstrous people. There was no way that it was anything but a coincidental resemblance.</p><p>Turning, Agatha pressed her back against the wall and slid down to sit on the floor.</p><p>Deep down, she knew she was rationalizing. There was no mistaking what she had seen. There was no denying whose obituary she had seen.</p><p>For a very long while Agatha sat, knees pulled up to her chest, feeling a strange cavalcade of emotions tumble through her. Fear, anger, joy, sorrow, unbridled glee. It was all so much.</p><p>Hela was dead. Hela who had hurt her, who had hit and controlled and tried to trap her.</p><p>Hela was dead, and Agatha was not the only person she had harmed, had damn near destroyed.</p><p>A soft knock at the bathroom door drew Agatha up out of confusion.</p><p>"Agatha? Babe, you okay?"</p><p>Scrambling to her feet, Agatha opened the door and threw herself into Rio's arms.</p><p>"I... I'm..." she tried.</p><p>"What's up? You feel sick?"</p><p>"Rio, I... Your cousin, the one who hurt you..."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Her name was Hela?"</p><p>"Yup," Rio said, rubbing Agatha's back.</p><p>"She's dead? Really dead?"</p><p>"Really most sincerely dead, <em>mi amor</em>. You... Are you bothered that me an' Ma were acting all relieved? I'm sorry if..."</p><p>"No, I just... I... Fuck, I'm so happy I could cry."</p><p>"Well, thanks. I'm pretty fucking happy too."</p><p>Looking into Rio's eyes, Agatha suddenly felt afraid.</p><p>"There's something... I should tell you why I..."</p><p>Oh, just spit it out!</p><p>"Rio, Hela was... She..."</p><p>"Hey, listen, you don't have to feel any certain way about this or..."</p><p>"Rio, she was the one who... Hela was my ex."</p><p>A look of confusion crossed Rio's face.</p><p>"Your ex?"</p><p>"Yes. The one who fucked me up so damn much. It was her."</p><p>"You... She... That rancid bitch... Oh, shit, Agatha, I'm so sorry! I... If I'd known..."</p><p>"It's nothing to do with you. Just seeing her again was sort of a shock."</p><p>"I bet."</p><p>Rio eased back from their embrace, carefully brushing a few strands of hair back from Agatha's face.</p><p>"Does this change stuff?" they asked.</p><p>"Why would it?"</p><p>"Well, I mean, I'm... I'm related to the person who hurt you. Who abused you."</p><p>"She hurt you too, Rio. She abused you in ways that I can't imagine."</p><p>"Sure, but... But if you... If it'd be uncomfortable for us to be together anymore..."</p><p>"What? Rio, please, don't say that!"</p><p>"I just mean I'd understand if you don't wanna see me or..."</p><p>"You're all I ever want! This does not at all change us, at least not for me. If you'd be bothered because I'm basically her damaged goods..."</p><p>"No! No way. I love you, Agatha, and nothing can make me stop. Besides, you're not damaged goods. Your beautiful and brave and strong. You're perfect."</p><p>Agatha lifted her hand to Rio's cheek.</p><p>"Kiss me quick?" she whispered, and Rio obliged.</p><p>They made their excuses quickly to Lilia after that, though they did not escape her apartment without quite a few little containers of leftovers. They held hands in the back of the Uber that took them to Agatha's, silently keeping touch, and then they held hands all the way up to the apartment.</p><p>As Agatha entered, she carried the canvas shopping back full of food containers that Lilia had insistently pressed on them, and it was not until she was loading all of the little plastic boxes into the fridge that she realized Rio was not right at her side.</p><p>She found Rio still hesitating at the threshold of the apartment door, staring down at their feet, hands jammed deep in the pockets of their jacket.</p><p>"I... You sure you want me around?" they asked.</p><p>"Of course I do."</p><p>Still Rio hesitated, and so Agatha opened her arms.</p><p>"C'mere, baby."</p><p>Rio shuffled nervously toward her, closing the door behind them and then hugging Agatha tight.</p><p>"None of what that bitch ever did, to either of us, is your fault or mine," Agatha said.</p><p>"I know, but..."</p><p>"Rio, I love you. I love you more than I've ever imagined I could love another person. There was a time when I thought it would be impossible for me to fall in love ever again. But you, Rio, found the way to my heart."</p><p>"I'll never hurt you," Rio husked, "or try to control you or force you to do anything you don't want."</p><p>"I know that. I'll never do any of that to you, either."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"I love you. Wanna keep loving you forever."</p><p>"Sounds good to me."</p><p>They stayed there a long time. At last, Agatha pulled away.</p><p>"Do you feel safe with me, Rio?"</p><p>"Always. You feel safe with me?"</p><p>"Always."</p><p>Eventually, they got around to putting away the rest of the leftovers, and then they went quietly to bed and held each other in the dark and shed tears of mutual relief that they had both long since escaped Hela's darkness.</p>

<p>Ever since the revelation of Christmas night, Rio had gotten very cautious with Agatha. Somehow they seemingly had become even more gentle and thoughtful, careful about every little move they made. It was sweet, really, but got a little annoying in the way it changed aspects of sex.</p><p>Now, even if Agatha initiated, Rio would seem hesitant.</p><p>"Do... Are you sure you wanna?" they would ask.</p><p>"I very much wanna. But if you don't..."</p><p>"I do! I just... I don't wanna pressure you or anything."</p><p>"You're not pressuring me, baby. I promise, there is no pressure. That goes for you too. I never want you to feel pressured."</p><p>A few days after they rang in the New Year together, they were in Rio's apartment, simply relaxing in bed, and Agatha decided to try and talk matters out.</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p>"Hnn?" Rio grunted, hand stroking up and down Agatha's back.</p><p>"Do you still want me?"</p><p>"Want... Course I want you, Agatha. You're my girl. You're everything."</p><p>"Then what's wrong?"</p><p>"Nothin' wrong, sweetheart."</p><p>"Ever since Christmas I just feel like you might be pulling away a little. I just... If you want me to leave you alone..."</p><p>"No, no, please," Rio rushed, rolling onto their side to face Agatha, "I don't want anything like that. I swear. I don't mean to seem distant or anything. I just... Ya gotta admit, Christmas was a big thing. I mean what we found out."</p><p>"It was."</p><p>"It's not I don't want you or anything. Just knowing, though, that the same person did so much harm to both of us..."</p><p>"Oh, she hardly harmed me."</p><p>"Bullcorn. You've told me she hurt you, hit you, controlled you..."</p><p>"Well, that's still not whatever she did to you."</p><p>"Different context. I was a little kid in her care. You were a romantic partner. I mean, I've no doubt she could have ended up doing stuff to you like she did to me an' Lenny, but... Well, I... I'm just glad she didn't. Wouldn't want you to ever go through that. Bad enough she hit you and tried to force a baby on you."</p><p>Agatha sighed and snuggled even more tightly against Rio.</p><p>"Hela did hurt me a lot. But you, you've never hurt me."</p><p>"Yeah, well, I just don't wanna risk that I might."</p><p>"You won't. Rio, you're so sweet to me, and so gentle. You've never hurt me and I know you never will."</p><p>"Not just you I worry about."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Rio let out a little groan.</p><p>"I think about... Look, I know we've only been together a few months, but I think we have a chance to make it work, to be together for the long haul. And I worry about if... Like if you... What if..."</p><p>Rio was getting twitchy, and Agatha gently hugged them.</p><p>"Okay, baby. Take your time. I'm here to listen when you're ready.."</p><p>"You... Even after what she did, do you think you ever... That you'd want kids?"</p><p>"Oh, I know I do. I wasn't ready when I was with her; it was so much, right out of college, and with someone who... Well, she wanted a child, and it seemed like after a while all I was to her was the vessel to provide that."</p><p>Agatha felt the achy tightness of unshed tears creeping into her throat, and she clung all the closer to Rio. They kissed her forehead and stroked her hair. The sweetness made the ache fade quickly enough.</p><p>"I know that when the time comes," Agatha went on, "I definitely want at least one child with someone who loves and respects me as a person and not just as a means to an end."</p><p>"Think you'd ever want a child with me?"</p><p>"Well, given that I'm hoping you'll be the person I'm with for the rest of my life, and that you've never treated me with anything but love and kindness and care, yes. I mean, if you'll recall the first night we slept together..."</p><p>"I'n still really sorry I said what I said then. That I... If it was anything like..."</p><p>"My love, you have nothing at all to be sorry for. That was beautiful."</p><p>"I just remember how scared you were later on when you realized we hadn't been careful."</p><p>"Yeah, because it was our first weekend together. Hell, it was my first time with anyone since I got away from her. I just didn't want to ruin things."</p><p>"I... Okay. Okay. But, like, if we did have kids one day, what if... What if I hurt 'em? What if I'm like her or something and I don't know it?"</p><p>"Rio, you are nothing like her. You won't hurt me, and if we ever have children, you won't hurt them. You're kind and gentle and I know you'll love our children. You'll be wonderful with them."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Mm-hmm. I worry a little over how I'll be as a mother, considering the example I had, but together, I'm certain we could be great parents."</p><p>"You'll be the best mom ever," Rio said.<br/>"Our kids'll always know you love 'em, and you'll teach 'em so many cool things and... And we'll all be happy."</p><p>"We will. We'll be very happy. Now, as for all this fear, please know that if there's ever anything making me uncomfortable, I'll tell you."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah. And I hope if ever anything I do makes you uncomfortable..."</p><p>"I'll tell you. You don't give yourself credit, I think, but you're really gentle too, at least with me. You've never crossed my boundaries or anything. That's rare."</p><p>"It shouldn't be rare. Oh, my poor Rio."</p><p>"I'm okay. I'm real strong."</p><p>"I know you are. I just wish I could take away all the bad things that have happened in your life."</p><p>"Well, I want to take away the bad things that have happened in your life. We're pretty evenly matched on that."</p><p>Rio pulled the blankets up closer and kissed Agatha softly.</p><p>"Next month," they whispered, "when I'm off at that work conference, can I call you each night?"</p><p>"Of course you can," Agatha said.</p><p>"Good. 'Cause I already know I'll miss you so much."</p><p>"I'll miss you too. Thank goodness it's only a weekend, hmm?"</p><p>"Yeah. Can I... Would it be okay..."</p><p>Rio shivered and seemed particularly nervous. Agatha smiled and rubbed their back.</p><p>"What, baby? What do you want?"</p><p>"Can I make love to you? If you don't want to, I get it..."</p><p>"Rio, I not only want to, I almost feel like I need to."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>"I want you right now, Rio, and I know you want me."</p><p>"I do. I want you so bad."</p><p>"So, be a good boy and take what you want."</p><p>Of course, as ever, Rio was gentle to start, but even so there was right away an extra heat and drive to their motions, pulling Agatha tight to them for a kiss that seemed almost to last forever, sliding their thigh between her legs.</p><p>"Can I touch you?" they asked.</p><p>"You better."</p><p>Agatha found herself on her back then, Rio reaching down into her sweatpants and cupping her sex.</p><p>"I love you, Agatha."</p><p>"I love you too."</p><p>A single finger parted Agatha, sliding and dabbling in her wetness, circling her clit.</p><p>"How are you always so ready?" Rio asked.</p><p>"It's easy... Fuck! You're irresistible."</p><p>Rio smirked.</p><p>"I am, aren't I?"</p><p>The finger circled again, slid, and the tip of it barely entered Agatha.</p><p>"Please?" she whimpered.</p><p>"Gettin' there, <em>mi amor</em>. Gettin' there."</p><p>A second finger moved into place, and as they slid inside, Rio nipped lightly at the pulse point to the left of Agatha's throat.</p><p>"Fuck, Rio, I... Fuck..."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Just fuck me! Fuck!"</p><p>Rio's lips were soothing the nipped spot with a warm kiss that quickly became an attempt to leave a mark. Heart racing, Agatha ran her fingers through Rio's hair, hand coming to rest at the back of their head. She had discovered just lately that she liked to be a little marked up.</p><p>She wanted everyone who saw her to somehow know that she belonged to Rio.</p><p>"So soft," Rio muttered, fingers moving quicker, parting slightly.</p><p>There was a very tight, precise little twist that Rio's fingers made on each stroke, the rough tips brushing over the perfect spot. Agatha sighed and closed her eyes, focusing on how sensations built and built, making her feel dreamy. It was as if a tender warmth was growing in her mind, wiping out anything but the jolts of pleasure.</p><p>"Rio... Rio, I..."</p><p>There was no need for speech, perhaps, and yet she could not stop herself attempting to verbalize her pleasure, only for the word to shudder apart into sighs and moans and disjointed sounds.</p><p>"Gonna cum for me?" Rio asked.</p><p>"Mmm, I... Oh! Fuck!"</p><p>"That's it. Good girl. Cum for me, Agatha. Lemme feel you."</p><p>It was cliché: in her head, Agatha visualized fireworks bursting, fire roaring, the crashing of a ninth wave, and she was left feeling weak and shaky and in need of the warmth of Rio's arms around her. She got what she needed, as well as soft kisses and gentle words of affection.</p><p>"You're so beautiful, Agatha. <em>Mi amor</em>. <em>Mi vida</em>. So perfect and beautiful."</p><p>"Rio," Agatha whimpered, "never leave me."</p><p>"I'm here, sweetheart. Not leaving you. I wanna be with you always."</p><p>"I love you."</p><p>"I love you too. So much."</p><p>Once more Rio rearranged the blankets, making everything neat and warm, then wrapping their arms around Agatha again.</p><p>"Warm enough?" they rumbled.</p><p>Agatha kissed them and smiled.</p><p>"Yes. I'm always warm enough with you."</p><p>"Good. Gotta keep you comfortable. You deserve to be as comfortable as possible."</p><p>"So do you."</p><p>"I've never been more comfortable than I am with you."</p><p>Rio's phone jangled on the nightstand. With a grunt, they half-turned over and grabbed it.</p><p>"Hello? Hey, Ma. Yeah, I'm good. Yeah. Oh, uhm, yeah, she's good too. She's right here with me, in fact. Yup. Well, I think we were just about to go to sleep. Right. Okay. I will, Ma. Love ya. G'night."</p><p>Bumping the phone back down onto the nightstand, Rio sighed and snuggled up to Agatha again.</p><p>"Ma says hi."</p><p>Agatha felt herself blushing, and she groaned as she buried her face against Rio's chest.</p><p>"Something wrong?" Rio asked.</p><p>"Oh, God, what... What if she knows what we just did?"</p><p>"Well, I doubt she does. Even if she did, she'd be happy for us."</p><p>"Still, I... Ugh."</p><p>"Don't worry, sweetheart. What happens in bed stays in bed."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>"Unless, ya know, we fuck somewhere besides the bed."</p>

<p>Agatha genuinely felt like she might go a little crazy while Rio was away for the weekend. They had spent weekends apart since meeting of course, but it had always been with the knowledge that they were in the same city and could see each other if they wanted. Now, though, Rio was three states away at some conference about the future of the funeral industry, and Agatha was home with a bottle of blackberry schnapps and her phone, waiting for Rio to call.</p><p>Rio had called last night, Friday night, but was too tired for more than some talking and wishing that Agatha was with them. They had finally started to doze off, and Agatha had gently wished them good night and told them to be a good boy and get some rest.</p><p><em>"I'm always a good boy for you, Mamacita,"</em> Rio had mumbled, and Agatha had gone to her own rest with a smile on her face.</p><p>Today, Rio had texted Agatha throughout the day, and had intimated that they were in a mood for tonight's call to be a little more romantic.</p><p>Agatha was all for that.</p><p>When the phone rang a little after 10 p.m., Agatha rushed to answer without even fully realizing it was a video call until Rio's gorgeous dark eyes and soft smile filled the screen.</p><p>"<em>Hey, mi amor,"</em> Rio said, and sat down on the edge of the creaky hotel bed.</p><p>"Hey, my love," Agatha whispered.</p><p>She was not sure why, but she felt a little tearful.</p><p><em>"Sweetheart, what's wrong? You look sad."</em></p><p>Agatha shrugged and managed a smile.</p><p>"Just miss you so much."</p><p><em>"I miss you too. I'll be home Monday, okay? And remember, we're having dinner together Tuesday night, out with Alice and Jen. We'll be back together before you know it."</em></p><p>"I've just... I dunno. I'm so used to having you here whenever I want you or need you and..."</p><p><em>"Hey, why don't you take a peek in your nightstand? I left something for you."</em></p><p>Shifting over, Agatha opened the drawer and noted a vaguely familiar bag there.</p><p>"Is this..." she trailed off.</p><p><em>"Open and see."</em></p><p>Tugging open the drawstring, Agatha grinned when she say that her guess had been correct.</p><p>"Little Rio!"</p><p><em>"In the flesh,"</em> Rio laughed, <em>"or really the silicone."</em></p><p>"Oh, but why leave him here? I know he's the one you like to wear most. Then one that feels the most... Well..."</p><p><em>"The most me, yeah. But I figured, since we can't totally be together in person this weekend, you ought to at least have a little bit of me there. Ya know, if you need."</em></p><p>"Oh, I think I do. I need you so much."</p><p><em>"Good. 'Cause damn, babe, I need you too."</em></p><p>A shiver ran through Agatha, and she sighed, lying back on her bed.</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p><em>"Yeah?"</em></p><p>"Please fuck me."</p><p><em>"You want it? You got it, sweetheart. Fuck, you look so pretty. My beautiful girl, all needy for me."</em></p><p>Agatha was deeply glad she was wearing only an old t-shirt and some sleep shorts. Less fuss to get down to basics, as it were. With a moan, she held the cock down between her legs and humped up against it.</p><p><em>"Fuck,"</em> Rio breathed, and shifted around on the hotel bed.</p><p>"I want you inside me so bad, Rio."</p><p><em>"I gotcha, sweets. I... Fuck, you look so pretty. Damn, I want you bad."</em></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p><em>"Fuck yeah."</em></p><p>Adjusting her grip, Agatha pressed the cock more firmly against the crotch of her shorts.</p><p><em>"I love you,"</em> Rio murmured, turning over and clearly humping down against the bed.</p><p>"Oh, fuck, I love you... Love you too..." Agatha struggled.</p><p><em>"Wanna be in you. Please, please..."</em></p><p>Agatha let the cock rest on her lower abdomen for a moment, using her free hand to get her sleep shorts started rolling down her legs.</p><p>"You wanna be inside me, pretty boy," she murmured, "then go ahead. Fill me up."</p><p>Once more grabbing the cock, she teased it along her slit, almost just as Rio would, applying just a hint of pressure so the blunt tip rubbed against her clit.</p><p>"Rio!" she cried, legs shaking.</p><p><em>"Fuck, fuck, fuck,"</em> Rio groaned.</p><p>Agatha teased herself just a moment longer, then slowly let the head of Rio's cock pop into her pussy. She whimpered happily, toes curling.</p><p>"You feel so good, Rio."</p><p><em>"Uh... Uh-huh... Uh... You feel... Fuck, you're so good, sweetheart."</em></p><p>Slowly, Agatha started the easy in-and-out stroking that always drove her wild.</p><p>"Fuckin' YES!"</p><p>Rio simply groaned in response, and her face was a mask of thoughtful tension.</p><p>"Oh, fuck, Rio..."</p><p><em>"Okay?"</em></p><p>"You always feel so big, baby. Fuck!"</p><p><em>"You... You like that?"</em></p><p>"Love it. Oh, fuck, I love it, but... But not as much as I love you."</p><p>Agatha's eyes fluttered shut for a moment as she gave herself over to the pleasant stretch of Rio's cock opening her up.</p><p><em>"You take me so damn good,"</em> Rio rasped.</p><p>This was not perfect, since they were not together, but it was damn good for the moment. Agatha's pulse started to race, and her hips rose and fell to meet the quickening thrusts of Rio's cock. She could imagine Rio's body on top of her, breath hot against her neck, and she shivered.</p><p>"Rio... Rio, I..."</p><p><em>"Huh, sweetheart?"</em></p><p>"I'm gonna cum..."</p><p><em>"Good girl. Cum on my cock. Cum for me."</em></p><p>"Cum with me? Cum inside me?"</p><p><em>"Yeah? Want my load?"</em></p><p>"Please..."</p><p><em>"Oh, shit, you're such a good girl. So pretty when you beg for me. Fuck."</em></p><p>Rio's breath hitched in a tell-tale way, and Agatha moaned, fucking herself a little faster.</p><p><em>"Gonna fill you,"</em> Rio grunted.</p><p>"Yes, please, please, please..."</p><p>Off they went together, groaning and whining and shaking. Agatha dropped her phone on the bed for a moment, hands falling limp, cunt clasping tight around Rio's cock.</p><p><em>"Fu-huck,"</em> Rio groaned, <em>"you okay, mi amor?"</em></p><p>"I... Oh, fuck, yeah. Yeah, I'm... God damn, I love you so much."</p><p><em>"Likewise, my sweetheart. I love you... More than anything."</em></p><p>Body still shaking, Agatha's hips jerked, and she felt Rio's cock actually pop out of her with a gout of slick. Grabbing up her phone, she smiled to see Rio looking dazedly at her.</p><p><em>"I can't wait to really be with you again,"</em> Rio said.</p><p>"I miss you like crazy, baby."</p><p><em>"Stay with me until I'm really gonna fall asleep?"</em></p><p>"I'd love to."</p><p>Rio smiled, twisting over on the bed again and switching off the lamp.</p><p><em>"You feel okay?"</em> they asked.</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha nodded.</p><p><em>"You sure? I... We've never done it like that before, and I don't wanna, like, make you uncomfortable or anything."</em></p><p>"Oh, baby, you couldn't do that. It was wonderful. Every time is wonderful with you."</p><p><em>"Good. All I wanna do is make you happy. All I ever wanna do."</em></p><p>"And you always do, Rio."</p><p>Rio's satisfied smile broke into a yawn.</p><p><em>"Damn, I'm glad tomorrow's the last day of this thing,"</em> they said.</p><p>"Boring?"</p><p><em>"Ah, turns out to be a lot of old sticks in the mud here who don't like the way the industry's turning."</em></p><p>"Sorry to hear that."</p><p><em>"'S okay. Just be glad to be home where I'm a little in charge of things."</em></p><p>"Oh? You like being in charge of me?"</p><p><em>"I... No, I meant at work! I don't wanna control you, I... I didn't mean..."</em></p><p>"Shh, baby. I was being silly. You'd never control me unless I asked, would you?"</p><p><em>"Nah. I wouldn't."</em></p><p>"Good boy."</p><p>Yawning again, Rio blinked.</p><p><em>"Gonna go to sleep now, sweetheart. I love you."</em></p><p>"I love you, Rio. See you Tuesday?"</p><p><em>"Might see me Monday,"</em> Rio smirked.<br/><em>"Have to wait and see."</em></p><p>"Ooh, a surprise. I look forward to it."</p><p>Once the call was over, Agatha set her phone aside and sat up.</p><p>"Better wash Little Rio," she sighed, grabbing the toy up and leaving the bed.</p>

<p>For some reason, Agatha was exhausted at the end of work Monday. She made her way home with the intent of eating something quick if Jen was not making dinner, then maybe soaking in the bath for a little while and going straight to bed. Rio had texted a few times earlier in the day; they were back in town and worn out from the weekend. There was no expectation that they would turn up tonight, and yet when she got home, there was Rio's motorcycle in the parking lot. Hurrying up to the apartment...</p><p>"Rio!"</p><p>"Hey, sweetheart."</p><p>They turned quickly from the stove as she threw herself into their arms.</p><p>"I thought you were so tired when you got back."</p><p>"I was, but I was able to rest a while. Then I decided to come over here and make dinner for you and Jen. Of course, turns out Jen had plans, but she let me in."</p><p>"So dinner for just you and me, then?"</p><p>"Looks that way. I am making extra though, in case Jen wants any whenever she gets back."</p><p>"You are the sweetest person in the world."</p><p>"Ah, I just love my girl. Why don't you go take it easy while I finish up cooking."</p><p>"I could help you, though."</p><p>"Sure, but I want you to rest. If you wanna help, you can set the table, but then I want you to go settle for a while. I just wanna kind of pamper you tonight."</p><p>"All right."</p><p>Turning away, Agatha went to get down plates. Rio followed after and hugged her around the waist for a moment, kissing the back of her neck.</p><p>"I love you," they breathed.</p><p>"Mmm. I love you too."</p><p>Once the table was set, Agatha went to her room and stripped to her underwear, stretching out on her bed a while. The delicious smell of what Rio was cooking wafted in, and she sighed. It was amazing to have someone so special who loved her and desired her and wanted to do so many things for her; for the first time in her life, she believed in something like good fortune, and also in the kind of romantic love she had once decided only came to anyone but her.</p><p>When Rio came to her bedroom door, Agatha propped herself up on her elbows. For a moment Rio simply stared at her slack-jawed.</p><p>"See anything you like, big boy?" Agatha asked.</p><p>"Uhm, yeah. I... Dinner... Dinner's ready. We... It... You want dinner?"</p><p>"I <u>am</u> pretty hungry."</p><p>"S-so am I," Rio rasped.</p><p>Turning away, Agatha took off her bra, grabbing her robe and slipping it on right after. She heard Rio make a funny little whining noise from the doorway, and she smiled as she turned back.</p><p>"Okay, my love?"</p><p>"I'm... Yeah. Yeah, I just... Fuck, Agatha."</p><p>"Fuck?"</p><p>"You were... I guess I didn't expect you to be almost naked and I... Fuck."</p><p>Crossing to Rio, Agatha wrapped her arms around their neck, kissing them softly.</p><p>"You need something, my pretty boy?"</p><p>The whine escaped Rio again, and Agatha smiled.</p><p>"I think my good boy is hungry for something other than dinner."</p><p>"I... Damn, Agatha, you just look so good."</p><p>"Do I?"</p><p>"Always."</p><p>Rio's eyes were wide, desperate, the pupils blown.</p><p>"Kiss me?" Agatha whispered.</p><p>The kiss was deep, hard, devouring. Agatha found herself pressed up against the wall, Rio's hands on her hips. One kiss faded into another and another and another, Rio's lips moving from her lips to her cheek to her neck. When Rio latched on, teeth nipping, Agatha groaned.</p><p>"Good boy. Mark your territory, hmm? Oh, my sweet Rio. Fuck."</p><p>There was a soft pop as the suction between Rio's mouth and Agatha's neck broke.</p><p>"Please, please, can I..." Rio trailed off.</p><p>"You want a treat before dinner?"</p><p>"Please?"</p><p>Reaching down, Agatha stroked the bulge she could feel in Rio's jeans.</p><p>"Mmm. You feel big tonight."</p><p>"It's Julio," Rio said.</p><p>"Oh, fuck me!"</p><p>"Can I?"</p><p>"You better!"</p><p>Rio buried their face against her neck with a little growling grumble, and Agatha swore her panties were instantly soaked. When Rio pulled back, eyes hazy, panting as they fumbled open their jeans, a little knot of tension that had been sitting in Agatha's gut all day dissolved.</p><p>"Leg up," Rio muttered, and guided Agatha's left leg to wrap around their hip.</p><p>The length of the cock pressed against the damp material between her legs, and Agatha shivered.</p><p>"Fuck, Rio, are you gonna..."</p><p>"Gonna what, sweets?"</p><p>"Gonna put that in me?"</p><p>"I am. Oh, fuck, I am."</p><p>And then the little barrier of fabric was pushed aside and the tip of the cock was rubbing, seeking, sliding, until it pressed at the entrance of Agatha's cunt.</p><p>"You ready for me?" Rio asked.</p><p>"Always for you," Agatha moaned.</p><p>Rio slid in slow, smooth, and it was a perfect fit, a belonging. Agatha whimpered happily, and when Rio tapped the side of her right thigh, up that leg came too so that Agatha was clinging to Rio, arms around their neck, legs around their hips, and they were driving into her, slow but rough, her back against the wall.</p><p>"So soft for me," Rio sighed, and kissed Agatha's neck near the spot they had been marking earlier.</p><p>"I love you," Agatha sighed.</p><p>"Love you too, <em>mi ángel</em>."</p><p>It seemed like they went for an hour, Rio holding Agatha up, filling her, and it seemed there were a thousand tiny climaxes, all building to the moment when Rio, panting, drove in hard and deep and then shivered, grunted, and sighed.</p><p>"Fuck," they whispered, and wrapped their arms tight around Agatha as they turned and staggered to the bed.</p><p>They eased down onto the bed, Agatha beneath them, and then slowly pulled out.</p><p>"You okay?" Rio asked.</p><p>"I'm great," Agatha smiled.</p><p>"I didn't hurt you?"</p><p>"You never do, baby. Promise."</p><p>"Good. Good. You wanna... We... We can clean up and I guess have dinner now?"</p><p>"Sounds wonderful."</p><p>What had seemed like an hour had really only been about twenty, and most of the food was sitting warm on the stove, covered, waiting. Brown rice with basil and garlic, spicy glazed carrots, and then what Rio grabbed from the fridge and seared perfectly just before they sat down to eat: portobello steaks.</p><p>"You're going to spoil me if you make me such wonderful meals even occasionally," Agatha said.</p><p>"Impossible," Rio laughed.<br/>"You can't be spoiled."</p><p>"Mmm. Try me."</p><p>They ate well, and did the dishes together, and then Rio smiled and guided Agatha to the living room.</p><p>"Can I ask you something?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"How long have you and Jen got left on the lease here?"</p><p>"Oh, until summer. We've been talking renewing, but then again Jen's been making noises like she might move in with Alice and..."</p><p>Agatha paused. Rio was sitting with her on the couch, looking very nervous and sweet, and she suddenly understood that there might be more than curiosity to the question.</p><p>"Rio, are... Are you asking..."</p><p>"I'm just asking you to consider moving in with me. I don't want to put any pressure on you or anything. If you want to stay here and find a new roommate if Jen leaves, or go somewhere else..."</p><p>"Oh my God! Rio, the only place I would even think of going... Oh, Rio, I... Of course I'd move in with you!"</p><p>"You sure? There's no rush, I just..."</p><p>"Do you want me to?"</p><p>"Only if you want to. I've got plenty of room at my place, and I know we've been together less than six months, but Agatha, I love you. I want to be with you, to come home to you, to spend time with you every day. I want that."</p><p>"And I want that too. Oh, Rio. My sweet, wonderful Rio. I never thought, never dreamed there was anyone in the world like you. Gentle and kind and caring and... And all for me."</p><p>"I just wanna make you happy. I wanna be with you and love you and make a life with you."</p><p>"You already make me happy, Rio. Every day."</p><p>"So, we... We're gonna live together?"</p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p>Rio's eyes welled with tears, and they kissed Agatha quick.</p><p>"I love you. Oh, I fuckin' love you, sweetheart."</p><p>"I love you too."</p><p>More kisses followed, and caresses, and they fell asleep tangled together there on the couch, waking only to Jen stumbling in a little after two in the morning. They lay quietly, bundled up in the old black throw blanket, and listened to her in the kitchen, heating up some of the dinner for herself. She walked right past them to her room, either not noticing or caring, and Agatha giggled softly against Rio's shoulder, then suddenly panicked.</p><p>"Do you have to leave?" Agatha whispered.</p><p>"Not unless you want me to. I brought a change of clothes and stuff for in the morning."</p><p>"Oh, thank goodness.</p><p>"Wanna go properly to bed?"</p><p>"That'd be nice."</p><p>Rio struggled off the couch first and, bending down, lifted Agatha in their arms.</p><p>"Careful!" Agatha rushed.</p><p>"I won't drop <em>mi reina</em>. I would never."</p><p>Off to Agatha's room they went, and Rio laid Agatha down carefully before stripping off their jeans and climbing in beside her. As soon as they were settled, she snuggled up to them and sighed.</p><p>"You really asked me to move in, didn't you?"</p><p>"I did. I asked, and you said yes."</p><p>"Thank goodness. I love you, Rio."</p><p>"I love you, Agatha. Rest now."</p><p>They kissed her, achingly gently, and then hugged her tight as the two of them drifted back to sleep.</p>

<p>Agatha woke as she now did on most days: wrapped in Rio's arms, comfortably nestled in the bed that they now fully shared.</p><p>She had been moved in with Rio as of a week ago. Yesterday, she had turned 25 and gotten access to her trust fund—oh, the annoyance of Val's "be responsible" talk as they drove over to the Murdock, Weying, and Strange offices to sign necessary papers!—which meant she finally felt a little safe about money. Not entirely safe, really, as the fund was not particularly enormous. But still, it was a cushion. A nest egg, even. On top of everything else, today was a Tuesday, but both Agatha and Rio were free of any work obligations.</p><p>"I am gonna spoil you all day tomorrow," Rio had promised over dinner last night.</p><p>It promised to be a very good day.</p><p>Rio and Agatha had been together for nearly eight months now. There had been ups and downs of course, as in any new relationship, but Agatha had never in her life felt safer and more loved than she did with Rio. Her sweet, silly Rio who, at the moment, was clinging to her, face pressed close between Agatha's breasts. Carefully, Agatha stroked Rio's hair.</p><p>"Good morning," she whispered.</p><p>Rio grunted, wriggled, and then Agatha felt the unmistakable touch of soft lips pressing a kiss to the center of her chest.</p><p>"Morning," Rio rumbled, the word seeming to vibrate straight to Agatha's heart.</p><p>She got to wake up every morning now beside this gentle, beautiful person.</p><p>Disengaging slowly, Rio rolled onto their back and stretched. Agatha allowed herself the pleasure of drinking in the sight of her lover, lithe and strong and present. Rio was not taped today, taking a little break, and Agatha had worried about how they would feel, but they had just laughed.</p><p>"With you, mi ángel, I feel safe enough to be however I need to be."</p><p>The words had been flattering and heartening. Rio made Agatha feel safe, and she wanted nothing more than to help Rio feel safe in return. There were things, she knew, that Rio might never feel safe about, but she would do all she could to help them.</p><p>Rolling back close to Agatha, Rio pulled her into a hug and offered up a simple, quick kiss.</p><p>"Happy day after your birthday," they said.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"I ever tell you that you're gorgeous?"</p><p>"Approximately 875 times a week. Did I ever tell you that you're gorgeous?"</p><p>"Probably, like, a thousand times a week."</p><p>Rio kissed her again, and again, then paused.</p><p>"How do you wanna start the day?"</p><p>Agatha smiled, rubbing her nose against Rio's.</p><p>"Could we make love?"</p><p>"Oh, we definitely can do that. You wanna..."</p><p>"You on top, please. I want to feel... I dunno. I want you on me and in me. Fuck, Rio, I need you so bad."</p><p>"Shit, yeah. Oh, fuck, so hot. Fuck."</p><p>Quickly, Rio was on top of Agatha, kissing, caressing, desperately grinding, and Agatha gloried in what, to her, felt like absolute worship of her body.</p><p>"Love you so much," Rio grunted.</p><p>"I love you," Agatha sighed, and reached down to stroke the bulge in Rio's boxers.</p><p>"Want it?"</p><p>"Please, Rio. Please."</p><p>There was an instant of stillness, and then the cock, Little Rio specifically, was out, pressing firmly against Agatha's slit. Agatha canted her hips frantically, desperate for as much contact as possible, and then...</p><p>"Yes," she hissed, shivering at the sweet stretch as Rio entered her.</p><p>In the moment, all Agatha wanted was to never be apart from Rio. To be with them all the time, to always be holding their hand or hugging them, to forever be kissing them or making love to them, would be equivalent to living in heaven. Rio had Agatha's whole heart.</p><p>"Mine," Rio whimpered softly, "are you mine?"</p><p>"Always. I'm always yours."</p><p>Rio's movements had slowed and shifted from rough thrusts to a deep, slow grind.</p><p>"Always mine?" they whispered.</p><p>"Forever," Agatha nodded.</p><p>"Good, 'cause you're my everything."</p><p>"And you're mine."</p><p>"I am. I'm yours. Fuck, Agatha, I... Oh, fuck..."</p><p>Rio froze for a moment, and at first Agatha thought they had cum, but then she realized that a phone was vibrating on the nightstand.</p><p>Her phone.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>"If it... If it's important, they'll leave a message."</p><p>"Sure?"</p><p>"I'm sure," Agatha said, and wrapped her legs a little more closely around Rio's hips.</p><p>"Fuck I love you."</p><p>Back to work Rio went, kissing Agatha and once more thrusting into her hard. The sensation drove Agatha wild, each in-stroke pushing a little whimpering huff from her. She felt almost intoxicated, mind hazed with pleasure. All she wanted was more.</p><p>"Yes... Fuck, Rio, harder... Please!"</p><p>"<em>Tan perfecta, Ágata. Ay, perfecta.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Te adoro, mi amor.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Te adoro. Quiero darte todo.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Sí, mi amor. Dame todo.</em>"</p><p>"<em>¿Quieres que me corra dentro de ti?</em>"</p><p>"<em>¡Sí, córrete dentro de mí! ¡Lléname!</em>"</p><p>Rio seemed to slow then, and Agatha caught their gaze, seeing uncertainty there.</p><p>"Please," she whispered, "give me everything. Please, my love. Please. Please."</p><p>With a soft grunt, Rio picked up speed again, thrusts getting short and hard, and they nipped at the side of Agatha's neck, then soothed the spot with a kiss. Something in the sweetness of that fed the heat in Agatha's belly, and she felt the pressure build, legs shaking as she tumbled over the edge into climax. Rio jammed hard into her just after, groaning and shaking.</p><p>"Fuck. Oh, fuck, mi amor. You okay?"</p><p>"I am perfect, baby. You're perfect too."</p><p>Rio went half-limp on top of her, and Agatha smiled, clinging to them as tight as they had been clinging to her before waking. These moments, the little relaxations together after the exertion of passion, were some of the best. So soft and warm and...</p><p>And her damn phone was buzzing again. Grumbling, she flailed her hand toward the nightstand, grateful when Rio barely moved and grabbed the phone for her.</p><p>"Thank you, baby," Agatha cooed before even looking to see who was calling.</p><p>Oh, Christ on a crutch. Mother. Mother, who had not called her in approximately a year and a half, and last time it had been to complain because the home had hired another...</p><p>Well, for someone who had spent their life allegedly devoted to specific leftist politics, Mother was incredibly racist. And sexist. And just fucking mean.</p><p>"Hello, Mother," Agatha said, trying to feign a bright tone; she felt Rio cringe and cling a little closer to her.</p><p><em>"Agatha, my darling baby, happy birthday! I know I'm a day late, but I just had to call!"</em></p><p>Oh. Oh, this had to be about the trust fund. Fuck.</p><p>"Thanks, Mother. That's very nice of you."</p><p><em>"Well, you know how I've always doted on you, Agatha."</em></p><p>Bullshit. Gaslighting BULLSHIT. The old bitch was daring to play it sweet, probably hoping Agatha would dip into the newly available cash and spring her. Whether she thought Agatha would put her in a nicer home or would take her in personally was unclear. It was also a moot point.</p><p>Pleasant Hill was the end of the road for Evanora Harkness. </p><p>Agatha and Val together had chosen Pleasant Hill very carefully when it became clear Mother needed to be settled somewhere with 24/7 assistance and care available. The place was clean, orderly, inexpensive, and offered the absolute baseline of care depending on each resident's needs. Mother had come out of the stroke relatively unscathed in most ways, but there were daily activities that had been impacted, and that she would always need help with.</p><p>It was certainly not the exact home Mother would have chosen herself, but neither of her daughters was certain a radical feminist commune-cum-nursing home staffed primarily if not exclusively by white women existed.</p><p>"It's just sweet you think of me at all, Mother."</p><p><em>"Oh, how could I not think of my baby? Why, to think, 25 years ago I gave birth to the most precious gift in the world."</em></p><p>Oh holy SHIT the bitch was laying it on thick. All she had ever said before about Agatha's birth was that the decision to skip the abortion and give birth at 50 had been the biggest mistake of her life, induced by having caught feelings for Agatha's other parent,—whoever they were, they had dipped before they even knew Evanora was pregnant, and frankly Agatha saluted them for saving themself while they could—and that the only upside to that entire part of her life had been going into menopause a year later.</p><p>"Really, Mother you're too sweet," Agatha said, and caught Rio's attention, rolling her eyes theatrically.</p><p>Rio gently pulled out, barely holding in a laugh, and moved to curl against Agatha's side. For her part, Agatha sighed and kissed their forehead.</p><p><em>"I was really hoping you might come to see me, Agatha. Just one little visit."</em></p><p>"Oh, gee, Mother, I would, but Rio and I are super busy today."</p><p><em>"Rio?"</em></p><p>"Mm-hmm. My lover."</p><p>She used that word because she knew on some level it just might irk Evanora. The old bitch always said love was no basis for a meaningful, change-driving relationship. There was no use in explaining to her that not everything in life needed to be purely for activism purposes.</p><p><em>"Oh. You're seeing someone. Is she nice?"</em></p><p>"Rio's very, very nice," Agatha said, and felt Rio squirm happily.</p><p><em>"Where did you meet her?"</em></p><p>"Oh, Jen dragged me out to a club last year, a little before Halloween. Rio was DJing."</p><p><em>"A DJ. How fascinating."</em></p><p>"Mm-hmm. Of course, that's just something they do on weekends. They're a funeral director most days."</p><p><em>"Is she?"</em></p><p>"Yes, they are."</p><p><em>"Agatha, are you dating a man?"</em></p><p>"No, Mother."</p><p>Frantically looking to Rio, Agatha winced.</p><p>"Can I tell her about you? About your gender?" she mouthed.</p><p>"Go for it," Rio mouthed back, and kissed Agatha's cheek.</p><p>"Rio's nonbinary, Mother."</p><p><em>"So a confused man who likes to wear dresses sometimes?"</em></p><p>"Mother, that's not..."</p><p><em>"Well, look, if he wants to look a fool and be mocked in the street, that's his problem. Maybe it'll teach him a little of the suffering of what it means to be a woman. You know, I raised you to..."</em></p><p>Agatha ended the call, and then she did what she considered perhaps her smartest move.</p><p>She blocked Mother's number.</p><p>"God, I hate her!"</p><p>Rio leaned up on one elbow.</p><p>"Is us being together gonna be a problem, or..."</p><p>"No! No, baby, no. Mother's just old and weird and doesn't actually want to understand things beyond a very certain perspective. A weird, twisted perspective."</p><p>"I just don't wanna cause problems with your family. I..."</p><p>"Rio, you're a part of my family now. My mother is just the crusty bitch who queefed me out one day a quarter of a century ago."</p><p>"Shit, sweetheart, sometimes you get so visceral..."</p><p>"Mmm, and you love that about me."</p><p>"I love everything about you."</p><p>Agatha felt a soft warmth spread through her chest, a familiar sensation since she had met Rio.</p><p>"Do you really mean that?"</p><p>"I do," Rio nodded.</p><p>"Oh, I... I love you so much. I love everything about you, and I love that you love me, and... I just fucking love you."</p><p>"You mean what you said about me being a part of your family?"</p><p>"I did. I do. You're so much a part of my family now. And someday, if we're lucky..."</p><p>Agatha shifted up onto her side and pressed herself close to Rio, kissing them deeply.</p><p>"Someday," she went on, "maybe we'll have a family of our own."</p><p>"Yeah. That... That could be really nice someday."</p><p>"Mm-hmm. You'll be such a good daddy."</p><p>Rio shivered a little.</p><p>"Say, uhm, you... You wouldn't be up for round two, would you?" they asked.</p><p>"Oh, I'm definitely up for it. Are you?"</p><p>"Hell yeah."</p><p>Round two was a little rough, fast, Agatha on top, riding Rio until they both felt entirely worn out. In the afterglow, Rio held Agatha a while, kissing her gently and stroking her hair.</p><p>"You wanna take a shower?" they asked.</p><p>"I should, but... But you can go first, if you want."</p><p>Rio made a funny little choked sound.</p><p>"We... We, uhm, could shower together."</p><p>Agatha's eyes went wide, and she sat up, pressing a hand gently to the center of Rio's chest.</p><p>"Are you sure it's all right, baby?"</p><p>"I feel safe with you. But we can go separate if you want. If you're worried it'll be gross or..."</p><p>"No! I just want you to... I don't want you to feel like you have to do things that might make you uncomfortable. I know how nervous you are about... About your..."</p><p>Rio took Agatha's hand, kissed it, then slid it down along their abs to slip under the waistband of their boxers.</p><p>"I feel safe with you," they repeated, and reached down to move the harness a bit.</p><p>"Will it... Hurt you if I touch..."</p><p>"No, it won't hurt. I... The sensation down there is... It's not a lot. I mean, I feel stuff, but... You won't hurt me."</p><p>In all their time so far, Agatha had not seen Rio completely naked, and she had never touched their genitals. They were nervous about the differences caused by what Hela had done to them, and they had mentioned prior girlfriends seeing or touching that area and being disgusted. Agatha knew she could never be disgusted by anything about Rio.</p><p>She could only ache for the horror and trauma they had experienced when they were so small.</p><p>Sliding her hand down, she found that Rio's mons felt not so different from some of the long-healed grafted areas on their legs. She knew from things they had mentioned that there would not be much hair.</p><p>"Future bush was not exactly top of the list of concerns when they were first treating me," Rio had said once, almost laughing, "and later on things... Well, later on I landed with shitty doctors."</p><p>Each movement, each increment of space that her fingers traveled, Agatha looked to Rio for assurance that they still felt safe. They smiled and nodded and kissed her once.</p><p>"You can feel if you want. You don't have to, but you can."</p><p>The further her fingers went, sliding to the beginning of a cleft, moving past a spot of particularly rough scarring, the more horrified Agatha was, not by what she was feeling, but by the thought of the agony Rio must have experienced.</p><p>"Oh, baby," she whispered, fingers lingering again over the rough lump before sliding straight to what she supposed was the urinary opening.</p><p>"They tried some more reconstruction when I was a teenager," Rio said softly, "but they botched the shit out of it."</p><p>"And it... It doesn't hurt or..."</p><p>"Oh, I'm all healed. And actually, I'm kind of chill with what I have there. Some of it feels right. I dunno if it's just 'cause I've never known much different or what, but it works for me. They managed not to fuck up the shit necessary to live; I can safely piss and shit and stuff, at least. Do kind of wish they hadn't fucked up reconstructing the clit, sometimes. I think it'd probably be sort of neat to have it more intact."</p><p>Rio was so blasé about it all, so calm, but Agatha still found herself wanting to weep. There had been so much pain in Rio's life, and there was no way to undo it. No way to make everything perfect for them.</p><p>"I hate that you were so hurt," Agatha choked out, and inwardly cringed because it sounded so stupid and pat.</p><p>"Yeah. I hate it too. But I lived. I just... I live with it. I hate when I think about the stuff that happened to you. I wish I'd been there to protect you."</p><p>"I wish I'd been there to protect you."</p><p>Rio smile widened a little.</p><p>"Maybe we can just protect each other now."</p>

<p>Agatha gave her hair one last look and then applied a final spritz of that perfume Rio really liked. Tonight was Rio's birthday, and Agatha was determined to make everything, especially herself, lovely for them. Dinner was basically ready, there was a chilled bottle of champagne waiting, and Agatha was finally feeling like she might be up for intimate activities again tonight after almost two months.</p><p>She still did not know how she managed to pick up the flu at random in late June. Who had flu in the summer?</p><p>(This question had been posed to Rio at one point when Agatha was miserable and achy in bed, which had led to a lecture on how a lot of illnesses can strike in nearly any season, and so Agatha had groaned and rolled over and asked for apple juice and another Advil.)</p><p>Pretty soon, Agatha heard the unmistakable clatter of Rio's gait in the hall. She rushed to the apartment door and opened it just in time for Rio to nearly jab their keys into her belly.</p><p>"Well hey there, lover boy," Agatha cooed, and Rio grinned.</p><p>"Wow, sweets, you look gorgeous! That a new robe?"</p><p>"It is, thank you for noticing."</p><p>Rio stepped inside and Agatha pulled them into a tight hug, feeling them go almost limp immediately.</p><p>"Rough day?" she asked.</p><p>"Just long. There was... stuff. Though this morning certainly made things feel easier."</p><p>Agatha smiled. She had awakened Rio this morning with gentle kisses and birthday greetings, as well as their favorite buckwheat pancakes. She had hoped that would be a bright enough start to their day.</p><p>"Why don't you go and take a nice, relaxing shower, baby? Dinner's all ready and waiting, but it can wait a little longer."</p><p>"I... I mean, I don't wanna screw anything up."</p><p>"Rio, it's your birthday. Nothing will be screwed up. Besides..."</p><p>Agatha nuzzled against Rio's neck.</p><p>"You might just find a present waiting for you in the bathroom," she whispered.</p><p>"Oh. Oh, I... Okay. Yeah! Shower sounds good."</p><p>And off Rio went, beginning to strip off their clothes as they crossed the apartment. Agatha hurriedly closed the door, then watched them go. They had only been in the bathroom for a few seconds when they let out an excited yelp and came rushing back out in just their underwear.</p><p>"Shower brush!" Rio cried.</p><p>"Yes," Agatha nodded, "I remembered how you..."</p><p>Her words were cut off when Rio rushed to her, sweeping her up into a hug and kissing her until she was left almost breathless.</p><p>"You are the best," they murmured against her lips.</p><p>"I just figured... Well, you said it would feel good on your back. I got the one with all the interchangeable scrubbers and everything."</p><p>"ThankyousomuchIloveyou!" Rio rushed, then gently set Agatha back on her feet.</p><p>"Go have your shower. And enjoy the new brush."</p><p>"I fully intend to!'</p><p>By the time Rio re-emerged from the bathroom, all scrubbed up and in their favorite pajamas, Agatha had the table all set and the dinner laid out.</p><p>"Holy shit, you made all my favorites," Rio marveled.</p><p>"Don't give me too much credit. Some of it's delivery."</p><p>"Still."</p><p>"Sit and let's just be together and enjoy, hmm?"</p><p>So Rio sat, and dinner was eaten, much footsie was played under the table, and Agatha drank the single glass of champagne consumed that night, then brought out the other gifts she had gotten Rio.</p><p>"Agatha, I... These are the boots I wanted! And these... Sweets, honestly, I... I... I just fucking love you so much."</p><p>"Good," Agatha said, standing and moving to pull Rio up into an utterly filthy kiss.</p><p>"F-fuck," Rio whispered as they parted.</p><p>"Well, I was hoping maybe we might get around to that tonight. It has been a while, after all, and I'm starting to be run off my feet with work and everything lately, so this might be the only chance for a little while, buster."</p><p>"Oh, I... I'd like to take the chance, then," Rio said, lifting Agatha in their arms but then wincing and putting her back down quickly.</p><p>"Pain, baby?" Agatha asked.</p><p>"Not too bad. Just need a minute."</p><p>"You wanna take a shot?"</p><p>"I... Nah, sweets. I..."</p><p>Rio sat back down quickly, and Agatha knelt to take and kiss their hands.</p><p>"Baby, if you need your shot, you should take it."</p><p>"But... But I..."</p><p>"I'll give it to you."</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, then nodded.</p><p>"Okay. Please?"</p><p>"Stay right here, baby. I'll be right back."</p><p>Agatha hurried to the bathroom. Rio had finally shown her how to administer the shots, even as they were tapering down and needing said shots less frequently. It was an act of total trust on their part, really, and Agatha felt overwhelmed with a gentle affection when they at last allowed her to help. Gathering up everything, she carried it back out.</p><p>"Here we go," she said, and knelt to wipe their usual injection site with a prep pad.</p><p>"Thanks for this," Rio murmured.</p><p>"Not a problem, my love. Now, let's see if I remember how. Pointy end in, right?"</p><p>"Agatha..."</p><p>"Kidding, I'm kidding. Little stick... There."</p><p>Once it was done, Agatha put everything away, disposed of the sharp, then returned to see Rio over by the bed. They were just "de-gearing," leaving Little Rio on the nightstand.</p><p>"Just gotta use the toilet and then I feel like taking you to bed," they said, crossing to kiss Agatha gently.</p><p>Now was her chance. While Rio was in the bathroom, Agatha rushed to remove her new robe, revealing the even newer lingerie beneath. Rio was going to get a kick out of all the lace that left just enough to the imagination. Settling on the edge of the bed, Agatha sat in a few different positions before she had a clever idea.</p><p>Rio came out of the bathroom, whistling softly, and went all the way over to turn off the light over the kitchen sink before returning to the bedroom and...</p><p>"<em>Mi amor</em>, that outfit is amaz... Wait, what are you doing with Little Rio?"</p><p>"Oh, I was just looking him over."</p><p>"You're licking him."</p><p>"Sucking, actually. And how can I help it when you've been packing him most of the day and he's been so close to you and..."</p><p>Rio shivered a little, stepping closer and holding out her hand.</p><p>"Can I..."</p><p>Agatha carefully handed the strap over and watched, highly satisfied, as Rio slotted it into their harness boxers.</p><p>"Proceed," Rio nodded, waggling their hips slightly.</p><p>Agatha snorted out a laugh and gently stroked their thighs before tugging them closer.</p><p>"I love you, you absolute goof."</p><p>Pressing a soft kiss to the tip of the cock, Agatha peered up at Rio through her lashes and shivered when they let out a low groan.</p><p>"Oh, fuck, Agatha, you look so pret..."</p><p>The words trailed off when she took the cock into her mouth and, with one practiced movement, managed to deep throat it.</p><p>"Holy Christ," Rio whimpered, hands burying themselves in Agatha's hair.</p><p>Honestly, to Agatha, what she had done was no great accomplishment. This particular cock was not horribly long, and frankly, she had been practicing in secret for a week. She did gag now and then as she went, and each time Rio would gently pull away a little.</p><p>"Okay?" they would ask.</p><p>"Mmm," Agatha would hum, nodding and blinking innocently up at them.</p><p>Eventually, Rio was lost enough in the moment to throw their head back, groaning, and to even tighten their grip on Agatha's head a little.</p><p>Getting face-fucked by the love of her life on their birthday had not necessarily previously been on Agatha's bucket list, but Rio's moans and movements were rapidly making her very glad about decisions she had made leading up to tonight.</p><p>"My good girl," Rio muttered, looking down at her, "so pretty, all dressed up like a present for me. Fuck, Agatha. Fuck, I'm gonna... Gonna fuckin' cum..."</p><p>In their time together, during the few experiences that Agatha had of blowing Rio, she had picked up quickly that they would fight the climactic instinct to thrust deeper into her mouth and throat, presumably worried about hurting her. This time, she was prepared, locking her arms around their hips as she felt them shiver and buck. Even as she clung to them, she could feel them pushing lightly as if to back away, though they were not doing so in a demanding way.</p><p>When they seemed done, Agatha released them, flinging herself back across the bed.</p><p>"What a good birthday boy," she cooed, noting a hint of harsh rasp in her voice.</p><p>"Oh, shit," Rio hissed, practically throwing themself down on top of her, "did I hurt you, <em>mi amor</em>?"</p><p>"No, baby. Oh, you did so good. Fuck, that was nice."</p><p>"I... I don't ever wanna hurt you."</p><p>"I know. You didn't and you won't."</p><p>"But your voice, it sounds..."</p><p>"Rio, trust that I am perfectly all right and very happy with what just went down."</p><p>For a moment, Rio's eyes seemed to cloud over, and Agatha wondered if the pain shot was hitting hard, but then they grinned at her almost wickedly.</p><p>"Speaking of going down..."</p><p>They kissed her frantically, moving quick to nip and tease at the pulse points along her throat.</p><p>"Oh, Rio..."</p><p>"What? I gotta unwrap my best present."</p><p>Rio's hands were warm, quick, and gentle, teasing here, pressing there. They took great pleasure in nuzzling at the lacey top concealing her breasts.</p><p>"Classy stuff," they whispered, and then they found the clasp and revealed Agatha's bosom to the air.</p><p>In an instant, they had latched on to suckle firmly at her left nipple.</p><p>"Oh, fuck," Agatha moaned, hand going to the back of Rio's head.</p><p>She had undone them, and now they were looking to undo her.</p><p>They spent so long kissing and licking and sucking at her breasts that she knew she would be covered in hickeys in the morning, but she found she did not care.</p><p>"Rio. Rio, Rio, I love you so much."</p><p>"The feeling is more than mutual, <em>mi amor</em>."</p><p>And then Rio hooked strong fingers into the waistband of her panties, moving to stand at the edge of the bed as they rolled the lace and satin down her legs.</p><p>"Welp," they said, "dinner was amazing, but damn am I glad I saved room for dessert."</p><p>Almost the moment Rio's mouth was on her, simply kissing up along her inner thighs, Agatha felt ready to explode. Her stamina, she decided, had been greatly reduced by the long illness and recovery.</p><p>They would need to find time to work on that.</p><p>Rio lapped at her greedily, wildly, and Agatha shivered, reaching down to stroke their hair.</p><p>"Oh, fuck, good... Fuck!"</p><p>They entered her with two fingers, scissored the digits apart, then managed to work their tongue in between. Agatha was pretty sure she was well on her way to heaven by the time Rio did a very interesting little tongue flick and leaned in just a little so that their nose bumped her clit and then she sort of...</p><p>Well, she blacked out for a moment.</p><p>When she was able to pay attention again, Rio was still at work, and they had moved to suck her clit while pushing into her cunt with a third finger.</p><p>"Oh holy fucking FUCK! Fuck, fuck, just like that, oh, good boy, yes! Yes, yes, yesyes..."</p><p>She had the feeling she squirted that time, and it was confirmed when Rio popped up quite happily licking their lips.</p><p>"Best birthday ever," they said with a smirk.</p>
