<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I cannot <u>believe</u> you talked me into this."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, Agatha, chill! It's one night out. Cheap drinks, good music..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sure, Jen. Good music. The last time we came to this place was a live night, and the headliner was a fucking Alison Blaire impersonator!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"That was four years ago. They've changed things up a lot. Come on."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha allowed Jen to drag her along as they waited to get into the club. She would rather be anywhere but here, at a club she had last entered when she was still technically two weeks under drinking age. Still, it had been a long time since she had a good night out. She was not counting Wanda's bachelorette party because, while there had certainly been good drinks and wild drama that night, it had really ended up mostly being upsetting in the final analysis.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">At least the wedding the next week had been worth it.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The club, once they were inside, was packed pretty full, the smell of too many cheap perfumes and colognes blanketing everything. Agatha and Jen managed to wade their way through the crowd to the bar and order, then turned to survey the dance floor.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thought you said there was a DJ tonight," Agatha said, nodding to the empty booth.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Jen scoffed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"People take breaks, Agatha. At least there's still music playing."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha distracted herself with drinking her gin and tonic as slowly as possible while fighting the urge to bob her head along to any of the music. Just about the time Jen was getting well into her second Manhattan, Agatha had barely made a dent in that first G&amp;T, and further progress was momentarily halted when a voice boomed out over the club's sound system.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"HEY, HOW WE ALL DOING TONIGHT?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Glancing over to the DJ booth, Agatha saw that it was now occupied by a figure with wild dark hair, eyes shielded behind dark glasses, torso shrouded in an enormous puffy coat.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, hey, it's Rio!" Jen said, leaning close to Agatha as the next set started.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yup! Regular DJ down here every other Friday and Saturday!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then Jen got distracted by something down at the other end of the bar and sort of wandered off, leaving Agatha all on her own.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Still nursing that first drink, Agatha shrugged and started to ease her way along to be closer to the booth. She wanted to see this DJ a little closer. There was something almost intriguing about this... Well, she presumed guy. Not that women could not be DJs and shit, of course, but there was something about Rio, who had now shrugged off the big jacket, that screamed "twink." Agatha had no interest in men, but she had discovered at some point that she had a social affinity for twinks. They were adorable, generally unimposing, and most of the ones she knew were almost as bitchy as she was. Of course, no group was a monolith, but still, this Rio seemed interesting.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The closer she got, the more entranced Agatha felt.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr"><em>'Oh, fuck,'</em> she thought, <em>'please don't let </em><u><em>this</em></u><em> be how I find out I have a 0.0002% attraction to guys.'</em></p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio had a soft, almost babyish face—at least what was not hidden by the glasses—and a slim, almost wiry build. Agatha could see, thanks to the DJ being clad in a mostly unbuttoned white button down, something like a hint of delicate muscle definition around the chest and abs, and as she got to the side of the booth, peering up the steps that led into it, she saw that Rio's legs were encased in dark leather trousers, so tight fitting that she was certain she saw a noticeable bulge. Of course, the only bulge Agatha <u>might</u> hypothetically be interested in was one caused by a packer, but still...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr"><em>'Fuck, was my drink spiked?'</em></p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">How was she feeling attraction to a guy? She had never experienced anything like this. Something about Rio was simply magnetic.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then, Rio looked down at Agatha. And then, Rio smiled, a cocky, bright grin with a small gap between the top front teeth.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Shit," Agatha breathed, and downed the remainder of her drink in one gulp.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Heading back the way she had gone, Agatha caught a bartender's attention and ordered a second drink. Farther down the way she saw Jen, deep in conversation with a cute, punk-looking girl. Good for Jen.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For a while, Agatha purely kept herself occupied with her second drink and her phone, desperate not to look at the confusing DJ. At some point after an hour and a half had passed, she heard Rio speak over the mic again, but still she kept her head down, pretending to find a recipe for lobster bisque—she had searched for the most random thing she could—shatteringly fascinating.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hi!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Glancing to her right, Agatha nodded briefly, then did a double take.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">That wild hair. Those dark glasses. That cute, cocky grin.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh," Agatha managed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I never seen you around here before!" Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... I don't come out often."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Huh‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I said I don't come out often!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ah! Well, kinda ironic you're at a gay club then, huh‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The comment took a moment to land, but then it hit. Agatha laughed and, to her mortification, snorted. She immediately felt herself blush, and she looked down at her drink.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm Rio!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, uh, I'm... I'm Agatha!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nice to meet you, Agatha!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio was offering a hand, and without really thinking, Agatha turned and tried to shake... But handed Rio her half-finished drink instead. Rio laughed, a raucous, warm sound.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I already get free drinks, but thanks!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Oh shit, I'm..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hey, it's okay!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Taking her drink back, Agatha finished it and decided she should make a quick, face-saving exit.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Uhm, I need..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You want another drink‽ I can get it for you free!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, thanks! This was my second! Hit my limit!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool, cool! So, you don't come to places like this a lot‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not in years!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Too bad! We get pretty heavy here! You seem like the kinda girl who'd enjoy it!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Well, I... I'm busy a lot!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I get that!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio waved down the bartender and asked for a bottle of water. Once it arrived, the bottle was chugged to emptiness in seconds, and then Rio grinned at Agatha again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You likin' my show‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're great! I mean, your mixes..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha studied Rio, trying to parse the vague androgyny of this person. Her eyes wandered up and down, but still she was uncertain of things.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, since you're here, are you..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Lesbian!" Agatha rushed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool! Me too!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Oh, thank God! Agatha felt a little more certain about her intrigue now. When Rio leaned in close, the world seemed to slow down.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, I got a little time before my next set! You wanna... Maybe hang out‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No pressure! Just thought, you're hot as hell and I... Well, I mean, if you wanna..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I mean, I won't... I... Is this..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's whatever you want it to be!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Glancing at her phone, Agatha felt heat begin to pool between her legs.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"How much time do you have‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Enough to make you see stars," Rio smirked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Shit. Fuck. Was she seriously thinking of hooking up with someone she just met? That was so irresponsible, so silly, so...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Meet me in the bathroom! Five minutes!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed and gave Agatha a little salute.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"As you wish!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Finishing the drink in her hand, Agatha tucked her phone into her clutch and eased past Rio, headed for the bathrooms. This was perhaps the dumbest thing she had ever done, but fuck it. She was young. She deserved a little irresponsible fun now and then, right? At worst this would be just a very awkward hook-up.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The bathroom was surprisingly empty as she entered, and Agatha was grateful for that. Checking herself in the mirror, she saw that she was a little flushed, and her lipstick could use a touch-up, but otherwise she was presentable. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and went into the third stall after a quick inspection showed it to be reasonably clean. She tore off some strips of toilet paper and arrayed them on the seat, then sat to wait. She was nervous that Rio would not bother to show up, but a few minutes later, she heard the bathroom door open and close, followed by the scuff and stomp of motorcycle boots.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>¿Ágata, estás aquí?</em>"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Ah, so Rio spoke Spanish. That was one more way to connect.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Sí,</em>" Agatha said softly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio's boots stopped in front of the third stall, and then the door swung slowly open.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You speak Spanish?" the DJ asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"And a couple of other languages. I teach adult ESL courses at the community college."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No shit. That's pretty great."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio stepped into the stall, closing and latching the door. Suddenly Agatha felt very nervous, and it must have showed, because Rio smiled and reached down to stroke her cheek.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You really want this? If you don't..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I do, I just... It's been a while since I did anything."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. You wanna just go back out and talk by the bar?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Standing, Agatha slipped her arms around Rio's neck.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just kiss me first?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Course I will. Of course."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio's lips were soft, and Agatha wondered as they met her own how they might feel on other parts of her body. She groaned, and Rio responded in kind, eagerly deepening the kiss.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Damn," Rio whispered when they parted.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can you... Can we go for a repeat?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah, definitely."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The second kiss ended when Rio turned them slightly and backed Agatha up against the partition with the second stall.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, babe, you're hot," Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha blushed, looking away until Rio cupped her chin gently and drew her back eye to eye.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I mean it. You're fuckin' hot, Agatha."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're pretty fuckin' hot yourself."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I get that a lot."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">With a smirk, Rio slid one hand down from Agatha's waist and fiddled with the hem of the purple minidress that Agatha had deemed the perfect look for tonight.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Want me?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded and whimpered and oh, if she had been fully cognizant of that noise as it left her throat, of the neediness of it, she would have been embarrassed as hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio kissed her again, softly, and nuzzled their noses together a moment.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, you look so pretty when you're desperate for me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Touch me?" was all Agatha could think to say.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She felt Rio's fingers, firm and warm, brush the bare skin of her inner thigh. They slid up, almost daring to press against Agatha's panties, but then the movement stopped.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, babe, you're so wet you're dripping. Fuck."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha drew in a shuddery gasp as Rio kissed her once more, at the same time bringing the fingers all the way up to press firmly against the satiny material of her panties.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ready for me, yeah?" Rio rasped, rubbing back and forth along the crotch of the panties.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please," Agatha begged, but her words cut off as Rio's fingers pushed her underwear to the side.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Pretty pussy all wet for me, huh?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please, Rio, I need it."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? You gonna take everything I got to give?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck yes!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Two of Rio's fingers slid in, smooth and easy, and then they scissored apart. Agatha groaned at the slight stretch, and Rio grinned. Slowly, achingly slowly, the fingers began to ease out, then slid back in rapidly. That was the pace at first: slow, careful, almost total withdrawal, then a quick slam back in. After a few minutes, all the movements picked up speed. Agatha was vaguely aware of the obscene wet sounds that the action made, as well as the scent of her arousal filling the stall. These sensations only served to ramp her up more.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio varied the routine continuously, changing speed and rhythm, adding a little quirk and twist of the fingers, rubbing a thumb over and around Agatha's clit.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Please, please, please," Agatha found herself chanting, and she was not sure what she wanted.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good girl, Agatha. You're taking me so well. Fuck, I could do this to you all night."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Agatha choked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Just as it was all coming together, as Agatha was on the edge of what she was sure would be <u>th</u><u>e</u> climax of a lifetime, there was an instant of distraction when Rio's phone buzzed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Shit. Can you cum for me, Agatha? Cum all over my fingers? Be a good girl and cum for me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The prompting seemed to help, and soon Agatha felt as if she had pitched headlong over a cliff, letting out a rough, growling moan as slick squirted over Rio's hand. In the aftermath, Agatha was certain she would fall to the floor, but Rio buoyed her up.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Okay, <em>cariño</em>. Just let it go. I gotcha. Fuck, that's hot. Fuck, you squirted so good, babe."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio kept pumping away for a few moments, then gently eased the fingers out.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Easy. Think you can stay on your feet?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Y-yeah," Agatha nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">To her great surprise, Rio leaned in and kissed her again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"That was beautiful. I... Wow. You're beautiful, Agatha."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Th-thanks."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Smiling, Rio once more cupped Agatha's chin—thankfully with the hand that wasn't soaking.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You got a ride home tonight?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... A friend and I got a rideshare. But I... She won't mind if we leave separately."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<u>Just</u> a friend?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just. Barely, even."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You stick around, I could give you a lift later. You want that?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... I... Yes."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You sure? You don't have to..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I want it."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Okay, yeah. You hang around the booth near closing time. Now, I gotta get back out there. You okay on your own?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, feeling so fucked out she could hardly think. It had been a <u>long</u> time since someone else made her cum.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">After one last kiss, Rio turned and unlocked the stall.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Remember. Stick around the booth, and then we'll see where the night takes us later."</p></div>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left"><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Jen, it transpired, had already been looking for Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Met someone," Jen blurted, downing... Well, whatever number of Manhattans she was on.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Great," Agatha said, "have a good time!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, I will! You okay for a ride‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Totally! I met someone too!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, then gestured toward the DJ booth. Jen's eyes went wide.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Rio‽"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Holy <u>shit</u>! Get it, girl!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">After a little more impressed staring, Jen turned and headed out with the cute punk girl she had been chatting up earlier. Actually, she looked to be heading out with a whole crew of people.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hope it's a fun orgy," Agatha muttered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She decided, in the interests of remaining relatively clear-headed for whatever might lie ahead, to stick to water for the rest of the night. Given the experience Rio had given her in the stall, she wanted to be able to be fully aware for whatever happened next. Frankly, she was also hoping to reciprocate some of the pleasure. Agatha Harkness was many things, but she would never be a selfish lover.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Well, selfish hook-up.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She let her eyes scan around the club as the night stretched on, but in the end her eyes kept wandering back to Rio. She allowed herself the indulgence of imagining a life they might have together. Of course they would likely not last beyond tonight—Agatha had, at the ripe old age of 24, already given up on hoping to ever find a lasting relationship. She was too needy, too cold, too in her own head.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Still, she could imagine.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio, she thought, would be gentle in bed. Always checking that Agatha felt safe, <u>was</u> safe, and that whatever they were about to do was deeply wanted. Concerned more for Agatha's comfort and pleasure than anything else.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It would be nice to have a lover like that. It would be a real change from past experience. From...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Oh, no. No going down that thought path, especially not in public.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The joy of imagination temporarily soured, Agatha took to her phone as distraction. There she sat at the end of the bar, water bottle clutched in her hand, scrolling thoughtlessly, when a hand came to rest on her shoulder. She looked up and Rio was there, smiling at her. The sunglasses were finally off, revealing wide, tearful-looking dark brown eyes that Agatha could easily get lost in. Rio leaned close to almost whisper, breath warm against Agatha's cheek.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You ready to head out?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yup," Agatha squeaked, nodding.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good girl. C'mon."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For an instant, Agatha hesitated. Was this stupid, leaving with someone she had just met? But Rio smiled at her and took her hand.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You want me to call you a car instead?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh, no. No, I... I just..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You don't have to go anywhere with me, sweetheart, but I promise you're safe with me, and I promise you a good time if we <u>do</u> leave together."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... I wanna go with you..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha trailed off, not entirely sure why she felt so nervous. Rio smiled, kissed her cheek, then whispered again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'll take care of you. Make sure you get home safe."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You good with riding a motorcycle?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uh, sure. Yeah."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I can always call us a car, sweetheart."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, it's all good. I've been on motorcycles before."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha slid off the barstool, and Rio looked around her briefly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Got a coat with you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha shook her head.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I didn't figure I'd need one."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"All right. Stay here just a second, okay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For a moment, Rio's warm hands cupped her face, and those soft lips pressed the most delicate of kisses to Agatha's brow. Then Rio released her, turned, and disappeared off behind some staff only door at the other end of the bar. Agatha shivered not with cold, but with a broken sort of wonder. That kiss had been so gentle that it made her feel... Something. Something beyond raw lust—not that she minded raw lust—that made her heart flutter in a way it had never done.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr"><em>'Fuck, what if this is just a heart condition?'</em> she panicked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio returned quickly, hauling the massive puffy coat Agatha recalled from earlier in the night.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You can wear this. I just have it on for the look when I start my sets, but it's super warm."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio laid something aside on the edge of the bar and helped Agatha pull the coat on, then grinned at her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You look cute."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha felt herself blush, and Rio huffed out a little laugh.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're even cuter when you blush."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, you're always cute," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? Huh. See what you say in the morning."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Grabbing the set aside item, an ancient looking cellphone, Rio checked something on it.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sure you wanna ride with me?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I do," Agatha nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, c'mon then. Your place or mine?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"How far is yours?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio shrugged.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"'Bout 12 blocks north."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Way closer than mine. Your place it is, then."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They left the club by a back exit, Rio grabbing a battered leather jacket and shrugging it on along the way. The motorcycle was parked practically up along the back wall, helmet secured to the handlebars with black cord tied in some absolutely gordian configuration. A spare helmet was produced from the under seat storage, and Rio carefully helped Agatha fit it on and fasten it.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sorry to mess up your hair."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's all right," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I won't drive too fast, but hold on nice and tight once we're underway."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I will."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The ride over to Rio's was... Well, it was a motorcycle ride. The city blurred by, lights streaking the darkness, and Agatha held on to Rio for dear life. When they stopped, having pulled into a quite dark parking structure, Agatha realized she was shivering, not with the cold, but with a mix of worry and anticipation. Rio helped her off the bike and took her helmet, tucking it away.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You all right?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, not trusting her words at the moment.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You feel safe with me?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yes."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. Because you are, you know? You're safe. Come on, let's head inside."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio lived in a part of the city that was formerly industrial, specifically in an old factory that had been repurposed into a mixed space: housing and work/studio spaces.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Elevator's down," Rio explained during the three floor walk up.<br/>
"The cables caught on fire last month."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"The cables?" Agatha mused.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yup. We think it was ghosts."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The apartment itself, once they arrived, was not bad: mostly one big space with a few areas sectioned off with quickly built partitions or artfully arranged folding screens.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"My little kingdom," Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's..." Agatha trailed off.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Laughing, Rio put an arm around her shoulders.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's a place to live. You want anything? Glass of water or anything?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Do you have a bathroom?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Just over through there."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio pointed to the one door in the apartment that was not the entrance. Nodding and smiling, Agatha doffed the big coat, then headed for the relative seclusion of the bathroom. Behind her, Rio whistled some tune softly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She had to look around a bit for the light switch, which flicked up with a satisfying <em>THWONK</em>, summoning to life a veritable midday sun from overhead. The bathroom revealed was neat and orderly, though it seemed to have been decorated in the 1970s with a minor goth inclusion at some point. Harvest Gold toilet with a faux-wooden lid and seat, Avocado Green tub. The sink was white, built in to a matte black cabinet and featuring a backsplash of dark tile. The floor, meanwhile, was tiled in a sort of sickly pink. There was a double-doored medicine cabinet above that looked to be made of rattan.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">While she used the toilet, Agatha amused herself looking at Rio's things neatly arranged on the counter. Thick white bar of soap on the edge of the sink. An old mug with a faded image of Snoopy held a toothbrush, and a hairbrush and comb lay neatly beside it. There was a small container of floss on the opposite side of the sink, a bottle of mouthwash, and then, quite randomly, what looked to be a jug of liquid laundry detergent.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Finishing her business, Agatha washed up and stepped back out into the apartment proper. Rio had hung up their coats and was sitting on an uncertain looking old sofa, very stiffly at the edge of the cushions. One glance at Agatha, however, and the posture eased, a smile gracing Rio's delightfully soft face.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You all good?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, and Rio stood, crossing to her, cradling her face in those strong, warm hands, and kissing her with a tenderness that made her feel strangely delicate.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Come to bed?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Definitely."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The bedroom was beyond one of the not-quite-ceiling-height partition: a space where a platform bed sat on a large, dark rug. There was a nightstand with a small, bare-bulbed lamp and an old-fashioned alarm clock, and opposite the foot of the bed was an old chest of drawers and what looked like a footlocker.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Going to the bed, Rio turned back the sheets, then turned back and held a hand out to Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Don't wanna rush you, okay? We can go as fast or slow as you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha shrugged.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I mean, you already fingered me in a bathroom. We could probably just get on with things."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sure. But I wanna be sure you're okay with everything. Like, if there's anything you aren't into."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm not into being beaten up or tied down very much, at least not on a first date. Everything else is on the table."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio grinned and sat on the edge of the bed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"This a date, then?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Carefully, Agatha went and leaned down, gripping the front of Rio's shirt so she could finally take the lead during a kiss.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Does it feel like a date?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Nodding, Rio groaned into the kiss and got a grip on Agatha's waist. It barely took any movement to propel the both of them back on the bed. Agatha felt definite pressure from the bulge she had noted earlier, and she snaked her hand between their bodies to cop a feel.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You okay with that?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mmm, I'm very okay with it, so long as you know what you're doing."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, I'm a master cocksman."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah? You got a little badge or anything to prove it?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nah. Don't need it. I can prove it all on my own."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Shifting slightly, Agatha sat up astride Rio's hips, grinding down. Proudly, she watched as Rio's eyes almost rolled back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, sweetheart. Fuck, c'mere and let me kiss you again."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hold your horses," Agatha smirked, wriggling slightly and pulling her dress up and off, then tossing it aside.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Damn, you got good tits," Rio groaned.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thanks. Do I get to see you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">That seemed to pause things for a moment. A worried look crossed Rio's face and she sat up, wrapping her arms around Agatha's waist.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I, uh... I have... Like, I got a lot of scars and I usually keep my shirt on so no one has to see..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay," Agatha said, "okay, baby. It's all right."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She stroked Rio's hair. For just an instant, she let herself indulge the possibility of there being more to this than just a one night stand. Some odd protective instinct welled up in her chest, and she kissed the top of Rio's head.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You don't mind?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Of course not. We both deserve to be comfortable."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I just... Really I don't wanna make <u>you</u> uncomfortable."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're not. Honestly, I'm very comfortable right now."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... I feel like I need to tell you stuff. Like it... I..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio trailed off with an exhausted little huff of breath, and Agatha smiled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You tell me whatever you want or need me to know."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I bind and stuff. Is that bad?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No. Why would it be?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Some girls... It freaks 'em out."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, I'm not freaked out."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry I'm... That this is stupid now."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's not stupid. You were concerned that I feel safe with you. Why shouldn't it go both ways?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha pushed Rio's shoulders gently, just enough to cause a sit back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Are you... The binding, the packing. Are you..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nonbinary, I guess. Good ol' they-slash-them."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. I just need to know so I don't say something wrong."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You won't," Rio said, and Agatha laughed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, thank you for having faith in me. Now, I believe you were going to show me your skills..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh," Rio said, and flipped them over, "I got some other things you need to experience first."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It was a bit of a fuss for a moment, getting moved around to lie not across the bed, but the more traditional way. Rio was gentle, Agatha was eager. Then came a rain of kisses and nips and licks along Agatha's neck, over her breasts—Rio paid particular attention there—and down her abdomen until Rio's teeth could grip the waistband of Agatha's panties.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, aren't you the eager pup?" Agatha teased, and to her delight, Rio growled softly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">There was a gentle tug, and Agatha raised her hips to allow the garment to be pulled down. Eventually Rio was knelt on the end of the bed, one brow raised, panties still held between those pearly whites. The sight was somehow enough to send a jolt through Agatha. Smiling, she crooked a finger.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Get back up here."</p></div></div>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio had practically pounced on Agatha after throwing the underwear over to lie on the floor with the discarded dress, but after that things paused again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're beautiful," Rio murmured, and then kissed Agatha's forehead.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So are you," Agatha managed, rushing the words out over the sudden threat of tears squeezing her throat.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Still wanna..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. I do."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. 'Cause I... You okay if I go down on you?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, fuck. I am totally and completely okay with that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio followed much the same path down Agatha's body as before, but this time there was nothing to stop their strong fingers from prodding gently at her flesh.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Damn. You always get this wet?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Only with the right sort of person," Agatha said, then gasped as Rio stroked her clit.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I must be exactly your type then. Fuck, sweetheart."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">If Rio proved, once again, to be particularly deft with digital touch, once things moved on to lingual...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck!" Agatha gasped.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Her legs shuddered as Rio lapped at her experimentally. The rumble of an amused chuckle against her cunt only made the trembling spread, and Agatha, needing to anchor herself as her mind quickly shut out all but the pleasure, buried the fingers of her left hand in Rio's hair. Momentarily, they moved and pressed a kiss to the soft skin of Agatha's right inner thigh.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You good?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'll be good," Agatha whimpered, not really thinking, responding on instinct.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio kissed the opposite thigh and then went back to work. For Agatha, everything was warmth, the delicious tingle of Rio teasing and sucking her clit, a delicate twist of fingers spreading her open.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha had thought she might take a little while to climax this time, but already she felt herself speeding to the edge, hips bucking, seeking to somehow tighten the connection.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, fuck, fuck!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It hit her like a wild wave, like a shot of electricity to the spine, and all she could do was ride it out, her grip on Rio's hair tightening. Her other hand was clutching the sheets like that was its sole intended purpose. There came an instant, before the last of her ability to think properly vanished, when she genuinely thought this <em>petit mort</em> might actually be the big one, the grand finale, and she found that she was glad. At least she would pass away happy. Of course, she did survive, but for a while she drifted in mindless pleasure, trembling, loose-limbed and warm.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr"><em>'Mind </em><em><u>literally</u></em><em> blown,'</em> was the first coherent thought that returned to her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">As the fuzz of bliss fell from her mind, Agatha felt Rio still down there, working delicately away. At some point she had released the iron grip on their hair, and they were now holding her hand. She squeezed softly, and they squeezed back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Agatha groaned, and wondered if she would ever regain any form of stronger articulance.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay?" Rio asked, raising up to rest their chin on her mons.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"M-more than that. Fuck. You... Fuck."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I do indeed," they rasped.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Kiss me? Please?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio moved to be not on top of her, but beside her, and pulled her close into their arms, kissing her warmly again and again. It was tempting to snuggle into the circle of their arms and simply to fall asleep, but Agatha knew there was more she wanted at the moment.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck me?" she asked, reaching to trace their bulge with a fingertip.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sure you want it?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck yes, I want it. Wanna feel you inside me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Even in the dark, Agatha could see Rio blush deeply, and they kissed her again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... You don't have to let me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm not letting. I'm telling. Now, if <u>you</u> don't want to..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I want to. I do."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">When Rio did not move right away, Agatha popped open the top button of their fly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can I see it?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. You can... Yeah."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The next button popped open, and the next, and soon the fly was fully apart and Agatha slipped her hand in, grazing against the front of tight boxer briefs. These had a fly as well, the standard little flap, and beyond that, she found the firm warmth she had been seeking.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're so hard," she said, stroking the length.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... It..." Rio choked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Such a big, hard boy."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio shivered, a small smile quirking around their lips. Gently, Agatha pulled the cock free and looked down at it. It was fairly ordinary looking, maybe seven inches long, not horrifically thick—thank goodness. The silicone was neon green swirled with black. It would probably feel quite pleasant.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Is it all right?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Very handsome," Agatha nodded, meeting their gaze and seeing them blush again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha let go, reaching to gather some of the moisture from between her own legs and then stroking it over the length of the cock. Rio whimpered and groaned, then thrust quickly into her grip.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're all ready to go, aren't you?" Agatha said with a smirk.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I've been ready since back at the club," Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh no. My poor handsome boy, suffering so long."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio suddenly tensed a moment, and Agatha worried she had said the wrong thing.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Should I not..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're doing everything just right," Rio assured her, then grunted and thrust again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, then we'd better get down to business."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded a few times in an odd, broken rhythm, then kissed Agatha once more and rolled her onto her back, settling on top of her and pressing the tip of the cock against her entrance.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Want it?" they asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Definitely."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">A single smooth, careful stroke left Agatha feeling just filled, and she wrapped her legs around Rio's hips.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Such a good boy," she said, and Rio's eyelids fluttered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Gonna make me finish too soon," they muttered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, we wouldn't want that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The pace Rio set, once they started to move, was easy at first, even gentle, and Agatha allowed herself to be lulled by the slowness, as well as the soft, lingering kisses that Rio kept pressing to her lips and cheeks and forehead.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're so pretty," Rio sighed, "and you feel so good."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You feel good," Agatha responded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">As they went on, Rio picked up speed, head dropping down by Agatha's shoulder.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck," they whispered, "you're so tight. You take me so good."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Smiling, Agatha stroked Rio's hair. Something about this moment, even though it was simply sex, was so good and soft and sweet. When Rio raised up and kissed her again, she captured their face between her hands.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Too fast?" Rio panted, slowing down.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No. Perfect. Just wanna... Oh, fuck! Wanna look into your beautiful eyes."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Again Rio blushed and smiled, for a moment pressing their forehead to Agatha's.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're good," they said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha's heart swelled, and she almost felt tears trying to rise again. Fighting the sensation down—how ridiculous would it be to cry right now?—she smiled. Rio ceased all motion and kissed Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Damn you're beautiful, Agatha."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thank you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">When the fucking began again, everything was slow, no rush at all. Eventually, however, things picked up again, and Agatha felt little tremors in Rio's body.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I gotta..." Rio trailed off.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Anything you need," Agatha assured them.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... Can I... Can I cum?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Of course, baby. Cum inside me," Agatha whispered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh fuck yes. Please!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Mierda</em>."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio's face went tense.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Voy a correrme</em>," they groaned.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Está bien, cariño</em>," Agatha said, clinging to Rio, stroking their back.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Voy a correrme</em>. <em>Te voy a dejar preñada</em>."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha moaned, the words impacting the perfect part of her mind, and she answered without really thinking.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"<em>Preñame</em>."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuuu," Rio wheezed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Their body stiffened and shivered as they instinctively thrust in deeper, and Agatha wrapped her legs tighter around their hips.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good boy. Give me all you've got. Oh, fuck, you're such a good boy."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio whined, hips twitching back slightly, then collapsed onto Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck, fuck, fuck," Rio groaned.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You like that, pretty boy?" Agatha asked, petting their hair.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Fuck yes. That... Fuck, we just met and you know how to push my buttons."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're no slouch yourself in that department."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">For a long time they just lay there together, Rio trying to recover, Agatha enjoying the compression of her newfound lover on top of her. When Rio finally groaned and rolled away, Agatha whimpered at the sudden emptiness. Immediately, Rio moved to embrace her.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Is it okay I said that?" Rio whispered.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Perfectly. I mean, I think you heard me respond."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I did. I... Just didn't wanna make you uncomfortable."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, you did nothing of the kind, Rio. Fuck, you're wonderful."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So are you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then there was silence for a while, for so long that Agatha felt herself being pulled down into sleep. She sighed happily and pressed a kiss to Rio's cheek.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can I get up a sec?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hmm?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Gotta take meds."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh. Oh, yeah. I should... Could I use your bathroom again?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Come on."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Together, they left the bed. Agatha padded after Rio to the bathroom, barely noticing as Rio went to the sink, pulled the cock from the harness, and washed it. As Agatha sat and relieved herself, Rio washed up further, took a few pills with a cupped handful of water, then began pulling bits of kit from the medicine cabinet.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"What's all that for?" Agatha asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Pain shot," Rio said, and sure enough Agatha noticed a little syringe.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh. Are you... Is the pain..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not so bad, but sometimes... Well, I take this each night. Usually takes me through most of the day."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha sat, feeling a bit like an intruder, and watched the whole process. It all looked very steady, very practiced, and once things were complete, Rio disposed of the syringe in the detergent container by the sink.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"All done," Rio said, and smiled down at Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then Rio washed their hands and left the bathroom. Agatha still sat there a while, worrying. Should she do anything to try and help Rio? <u>Could</u> she do anything?</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Once Agatha had cleaned up, she left the bathroom and found Rio sitting on the edge of the bed, having finally changed out the button down shirt and tight pants from earlier for a faded gray t-shirt and plaid pajama pants.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Do you have to leave?" Rio whispered as Agatha approached.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Do you want me to leave?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, but if you need to..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I don't."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. I'd like it if you stay. If you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, I want," Agatha rushed, and crawled back into bed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio lay down beside her and sighed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I really am glad you'll stay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'll get out of your way as soon as you need in the morning."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... You could... You could stay for breakfast. I could take you home."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mmm," Agatha breathed, "I'd like that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Scooting closer, she cuddled up against Rio, grateful when strong arms wrapped around her. Soon enough, she felt sleep truly taking her, and she felt Rio kiss her forehead softly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Sleep well, Agatha."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You too."</p></div>

<div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha was a little confused when she woke alone in a strange bed, but there was the warmth of very soft sheets to calm her and after a moment her mind caught up. Rio. She had gone home from the club with Rio. They had come back to the DJ's apartment together, and...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Well, normally Agatha tried not to overstate things, but she thought she had never felt more sated on a morning after.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">With a small grunt, Agatha turned over, stretched, and sat up, a hint of cool air sending a shiver up her spine. Fuck, all she had to put on were the things from last night. She felt awkward at the thought of leaving the bed naked. Sure, Rio had seen her naked last night, but...</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hey. Good morning."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">There was Rio, peering around the partition, smiling.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good morning," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio came and sat on the edge of the bed, and Agatha scooted closer.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're so beautiful," Rio murmured.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha huffed out a laugh.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Really? First thing after a long night?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I suspect you're always beautiful."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Then Rio leaned down and kissed Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm making us breakfast. You wanna clean up or anything?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I <u>would</u> love a shower."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool. I'll get you a towel and stuff."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio kissed Agatha again, then got up and went down to the footlocker at the end of the bed. Agatha sat up and watched them pull out a towel and a washcloth.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Here we go," they said, standing slowly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Are you in any pain?" Agatha asked, noting a slight tense expression.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No. The medicine helps. Here, I'll put these in the bathroom for you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha watched Rio head to the bathroom and stretched languorously. This was the first good morning after she remembered in... Ever, really. Quiet, gentleness, no rushing. As she left the bed, she smiled. Rio was terribly sweet—sweeter than she might have expected from their cockiness on first meeting.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They were just exiting the bathroom as she went to enter, and there was a mutual wobble of nearly running into each other.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Easy," Rio murmured, and steadied Agatha with hands on her hips.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The hands stayed there, gentle and soothing, for a good while, and then Rio leaned in for a little kiss.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good morning," they sighed once more as the kiss ended.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"A very good morning," Agatha agreed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You... I can lend you some clothes for after your shower so you won't have to eat breakfast naked."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thank you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I've had a really good time with you so far."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"And I've had a really good time with you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Could... This is gonna sound so stupid..." Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"What?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Could I just... Give you a hug?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Of course."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio shifted their stance a little, arms slipping around easily, and pulled Agatha close. Agatha, in turn, wrapped her arms around their neck. Rio was warm, wreathed in mingled scents of spice and resin and light sweatiness, and Agatha felt their body relax as she embraced them, posture going utterly soft.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay?" she asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio sighed and nodded.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You just... You're nice. Really nice."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hmm. Not many would say so."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, I do."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha chuckled and dared to kiss the curve of Rio's jaw.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're really nice," she murmured, and felt them shiver in her arms.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Rio eased away, smiling.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You go get that shower, huh? I'll get you somethin' to wear and then finish up breakfast."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">In the bathroom, Agatha looked in a drawer beside the sink and found a clip, twisting her hair up out of the way with it. For a moment she surveyed herself in the mirror, taking in the remnants of her makeup and a few little hickeys beginning to bloom on her neck and chest. Normally the marks might have annoyed her, but somehow the fact that Rio had made them meant that they were all right.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It took a moment to get the water comfortably adjusted, but soon enough Agatha was rewarded with a nice, steamy shower. Rio's soap was redolent of vanilla and something earthy and woody, and Agatha paused to breathe in the scent for a moment. In a strange way, it made her feel strangely safe.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Stepping out of the shower, Agatha eagerly wrapped herself in the towel—it was wonderfully plush—and let her hair down. She saw that some clothes had been left for her on the cabinet by the sink and, drying off quickly, slipped them on. Clad in a pair of loose black sweatpants and a massive gray hoodie, Agatha headed out into the rest of the apartment again.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio was in the sort-of kitchen area. There were cabinets, of course, and a sink, plus a little convection-and-cooktop combo for most of the cooking, a microwave, and a rather new-looking fridge. As far as seating, there was a battered old Samsonite card table with three folding metal chairs arrayed around it. It was an altogether eclectic assemblage, and Agatha found it oddly homey.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">She dared to approach Rio, who was busy with cooking, and to lean against the counter nearby.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, chef, what're we having?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio looked at her, grinning.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just basic stuff. A cheese-and-spinach omelette, turkey bacon, and sweet rolls. You like coffee or tea or neither?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Tea would be nice."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Excellent, because that's what I'm having. You want green, Earl Grey, oolong..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Surprise me," Agatha said, and Rio laughed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"A woman who likes spontaneity. Careful, Agatha, or you'll capture my heart."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Will I?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, most assuredly."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Turning from her work, Rio kissed Agatha deeply.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Go and sit, sweetheart," they said, and something in the softness of the words made Agatha want to melt.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Choosing the chair with the least battered paint job, Agatha sat and watched Rio work, deftly bringing everything together before carrying two plates to the table and setting one before Agatha.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Look worthy?" Rio asked, nodding to the dish.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It looks amazing."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good. Those culinary arts classes paid off then."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed and took up the fork Rio had placed near the plate.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Have you really taken classes like that?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Don't tell me you're secretly a chef at some high-end restaurant who does DJing on the weekends."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nope," Rio said, bringing two cups of tea over to the table, "I'm a funeral director."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yup. That freak you out?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not at all," Agatha shrugged.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool. A lot of girls, it freaks 'em out."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You must have a wide history of dating, and please pardon my phrasing here, a lot of scaredy-cats."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Maybe."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They sat and ate together, Agatha trying to keep a handle on her eating style, going slowly, chewing carefully, not wolfing her food. She thought she might be doing poorly when, suddenly, she realized that Rio had stopped eating and was watching her carefully. Setting her fork down, she let her hands rest in her lap.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Is there something wrong?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No," Rio said, "I just like that you clearly appreciate food."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Are you making fun of me?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No. No way! You just really seem into the food, and that makes me feel proud. You like what I cooked for you. I'm glad."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha wondered if she should break down that her appreciation for food was more a desperate fear of never having any. Was the morning after a one night stand too soon to info dump about her horrific childhood? Would it seem weird to just spew the facts?</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Definitely.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You cook really well," she said softly, telling the truth.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Did I say anything wrong?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Nah. Just life stuff."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ah. Well, I really am just glad you like the food."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled and slowly took back up her fork.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So, to completely change the subject," she said, "what do you do besides funeral directing and DJing and culinary studies? Got any hobbies?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I like to garden. We have a community garden up on the roof of this place, and I really like to go up there. I'll show you sometime, if you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'd like that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"And what do you do," Rio asked, "besides teaching?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Stay at home and avoid socializing," Agatha said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? How's going out to the club figure into that?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, my friend Jen dragged me along. She insists I need a social life."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Ah, well, aren't you glad she <u>did</u> drag you out? After all, otherwise you wouldn't've met me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'm mentally filling out the Nobel prize application for her as we speak."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, and their dark eyes were filled with such mirth that Agatha could not help but feel a throb of something tender in her heart. Somehow, she kept having soft, protective feelings toward Rio, even though they had just met. She wanted to wrap this sweet, kind person up in the softest blanket possible and just keep them safe.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You got anything planned this weekend?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Not really. I don't socialize much, like I said. I just sort of... Exist."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, seeing as how you stayed for breakfast, would you wanna exist with me a while longer?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I'd really like that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Good," Rio nodded, "'cause I hate doing dishes alone."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They did indeed do the dishes together after breakfast, and then they snuggled up together on Rio's battered brown couch. It was nice, just sitting together, breathing each other in. It was very quickly apparent that Rio had a fondness for playing with hair, and presently Agatha realized that any large tangles and snarls in her own wild mop had been  deftly worked out with Rio's fingers.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Could I, like, braid your hair?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"If you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool!"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio left the sofa for a moment, returning quickly from the bathroom with a couple of hair ties, a hand mirror, a small black comb, and a joyful expression.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You sure you're not also a hairdresser?" Agatha asked as Rio went to work.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"My last foster mom is one," Rio said, "and I used to hang around her shop a lot. Still do sometimes, on free days."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? You get along with her pretty well?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm. She's the best mom I ever knew."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Lucky you got her, then."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"In a way," Rio said.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">When they had gathered Agatha's hair into two loose braids, Rio handed her the mirror.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"How'd I do?" they asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hmm," Agatha pondered.<br/>"10 out of 10. I don't usually go for the schoolgirl look, but I think you've made it work for me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Definitely."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, a free, unbound laugh that made Agatha feel warm and cozy.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">The rest of the morning was spent with Rio showing Agatha all around the building, with a focus on the aforementioned rooftop garden, and then just goofing off in Rio's apartment. Said goofing off consisted heavily of making out and cuddling, and Agatha was certain that she lost control of herself and said a few silly things, but then Rio said silly things too, like going on and on about how Agatha was beautiful, the most beautiful girl they had ever seen. That was pretty silly, at least as far as Agatha was concerned.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">A little after noon, they had a wonderful lunch—Rio ordered takeout from some little Italian place—and then Agatha decided that it was high time to lure Rio back into bed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So," she started, "how would you feel if we were to lie down a little while?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You wanna take a nap?" Rio asked.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Something like that."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Cool."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">It was easy to curl up together in Rio's bed. Agatha snuggled down with her head under Rio's chin, and she was pleased when Rio nuzzled the top of her head.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're cuddly," Rio murmured, "and that's great."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You a big cuddler?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Mmm. But I never really get the chance much."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, I'll cuddle you all you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Truthfully, Agatha had been hoping for a fresh round of sex, but instead she found herself lulled to sleep by the warmth and closeness. When she woke, it did not seem like much time had passed. Rio had moved a bit and was now flopped over on their back, head turned toward Agatha, a little line of tension between their eyebrows. Carefully, Agatha leaned up and kissed the spot. That seemed to soothe the mark away, and then Rio's eyes opened slowly.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hi," they rasped.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Hi."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You okay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Oh, I'm just fine. You?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Just... Itchy."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... My scars get itchy sometimes."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Can I help you feel better?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, it's okay. I don't wanna scare you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I very much doubt you could, baby."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio turned back onto their side, pulling Agatha into their arms.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Just could you... Could you rub my back and side, like, here?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">They indicated the left side of their torso, and Agatha went to slip her hand under their shirt.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You... You don't have to touch the skin, if you don't want," Rio rushed.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Will it be bad if I do?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"No, just... I just don't want you to be grossed out. You can just touch over the shirt, if you want."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Do <u>you</u> only want me to touch you over your clothes?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Rio shrugged.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I just don't wanna scare you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I won't be scared, baby. I wanna help you, okay?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It's real bad," Rio said, tears filling their eyes.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Shh. Just let me take care of you, okay? Shh. I've got you."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Carefully, Agatha reached under the fabric, hand sliding almost immediately over skin that indeed felt heavily scarred. Smoothing her fingers over the surface, Agatha smiled at Rio.</p></div><p dir="ltr">"It's okay. Is this helping?"</p><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Y-yeah," Rio sniffled.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Okay. Oh, my poor Rio. It's okay."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You... I know it probably feels gross..."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"It just feels like scars. I've got a few of my own. Do they hurt at all?"</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Uhm, they... The pain is from... Just a lot of stuff happened to me, is all."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Well, if I do anything that hurts, tell me."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"You're good."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">Agatha pressed her forehead to Rio's, fingers still moving gently, almost massaging the puckered, rough skin.</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"Thank you for trusting me, Rio."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"I... You... You're nice. You're... You're nice."</p></div><div align="left"><p dir="ltr">"So are you," Agatha whispered, and felt the truth of the words in every fiber of her being.</p></div>
