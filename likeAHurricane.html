<div class="userstuff">
<p>Tuesday morning, twelve days and roughly twelve hours to go, seven if she was lucky – not that she was counting – found Jen Barkley in the corner booth of the best coffee shop Pawnee, Indiana had to offer.</p><p> </p><p>They loved her here, thanks in large part to the fact that Jen knew how to get people to like her and wasn’t shy about using that knowledge to her advantage. The Daily Grind had the best coffee in town (which wasn’t saying too much; this was, after all, Pawnee<em>. Indiana, </em>in case you’d also missed that part) and Ellen, the owner, happened to have been in need of a few minor repairs around the place that had been accumulating for a while. It had been easy for Jen to cover them, and almost even easier to leverage Ellen into a spot where she’d accepted the help.</p><p> </p><p>Now Jen got decent coffee – often free, not that it really mattered – and Ellen was free to focus on hiring more people or rethinking the wallpaper or her dad’s home health service. Which was good, because Jen had been dangerously close to the point of losing her fucking mind if she’d had to go to JJ’s Diner <em>one more time</em>. Jesus Christ, the end of this nothingburger campaign could not come quickly enough.</p><p> </p><p>By 9:30, Jen had finished her daily skim of seven international newspapers and had fifteen minutes to spare before her meeting with Newport Senior. And therefore also fifteen minutes before resigning her olfactory senses to the saccharine smell that always stuck around in her nose for three hours, minimum, after a visit to the Sweetums offices. Jen took a preemptive breath of freedom and coffee and stretched in her seat.</p><p> </p><p>The morning rush had filtered out when Jen hadn’t been paying attention. Now it was down to Jen at her corner booth, a table of geriatric men who’d apparently all collectively forgotten their hearing aids, a wannabe tech bro in a zip up fleece vest and a plaid shirt waiting on somebody to show up for a meeting, a romantic reading a Jane Austen novel at a window table and waiting for someone to sweep her off her feet, and the woman whose order Ellen was taking at the counter.</p><p> </p><p>Something about her, though, made Jen sit up straighter and take a second look. What, exactly, she wasn’t sure – but Jen hadn’t honed her intuition like a weapon to be wrong when it lit up like her old Lite Brite.</p><p> </p><p>She was young, mid-twenties, maybe younger. Surprisingly put together in neatly fitting jeans, clean white Vans, and a dark blue hoodie. Average height. Attractive. Dark, shoulder length hair. A wedding ring on the hand tucking her card back into her wallet – God, how young did people get married and start popping out babies in this hellhole? And the thing that had probably piqued Jen’s interest in the first place – an understated charisma that Jen could just tell that this woman hadn’t bothered to fully learn her way around.</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman finished paying and turned around to go wait at the end of the counter and – uh oh. Busted. Oh, well. Jen hadn’t made a practice of backing down from twenty-somethings in hoodies to this point, and she wasn’t about to start now.</p><p> </p><p>But it seemed like Mystery Woman might like that, because she was coming over.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi,” she said. “Why are you staring at me?”</p><p> </p><p>To the point, no time wasted: a woman after Jen’s own heart. Jen thought about bullshitting her for the fun of almost certainly being called on it, but opted for the truth. “I don’t know,” she said. “You seemed interesting.”</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman seemed skeptical about this reply. “You thought I seemed interesting… from me ordering coffee?”</p><p> </p><p>“What can I say,” Jen said. “I have an eye for these things. And I’m usually not wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you hitting on me?” Mystery Woman asked bluntly as she crossed her arms.</p><p> </p><p>Oh. <em>Interesting. </em>“I wasn’t trying to,” Jen replied. “Do you want me to?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m married,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t a no… per se. Jen let it go anyway, allowing herself a little preen and smile that, delightfully, made Mystery Woman scoff, but with a chuckle.</p><p> </p><p>“So do you usually have a hard time believing people when they tell you that you seem interesting?” Jen asked instead. “Because I’m getting the vibe that mystery and intrigue might kinda be your whole schtick.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I just find it hard to believe coming from you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Coming from <em>me?” </em>Jen said in exaggerated disbelief. “You don’t even know who I am.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I do,” Mystery Woman said. “You’re trying to sabotage Leslie’s campaign.”</p><p> </p><p>‘Leslie’, huh? “Last time I checked, I was <em>succeeding </em>in sabotaging Leslie’s campaign,” Jen corrected, because Leslie was currently eleven points down in the polls thanks to the <em>outstandingly</em> lackluster efforts of yours, truly. Let it never be said that Jennifer Barkley did subpar work, even at her most bored in a town that was making her more brain-dead by the second. “I guess that makes you one of her campaign staffers, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman shrugged. “I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Oooh, <em>definitely</em> part of her schtick. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re pretty much exactly the opposite of somebody I’d expect to see on Leslie’s team of earnest optimists.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well,” said Mystery Woman, “I guess all the spots for earnest optimists were already filled.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jokes, too,” Jen observed, daring to lean her chin on her palm. “Aren’t you just the full package.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s me, an apathetic pessimist with jokes.”</p><p> </p><p>The picture was starting to fill in a little. Smart, quick, loyal. Ready to fight. Apathy or pessimism aside, both of which Jen already doubted, she could see how Mystery Woman was just the kind of person Leslie Knope would want to take under her wing and foster like a baby bird.  </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm,” Jen said, drawing it out just to see if Mystery Woman would bristle. (Verdict: yes, but while keeping a pretty good lid on it.) “So what <em>is </em>an apathetic pessimistic doing on a contentious, losing campaign for a city council position in Pawnee, Indiana, then?”</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman only smiled like she couldn’t figure out why Jen was asking such a stupid question. “None of your business, really,” she said slowly. “Why do you care?”</p><p> </p><p>Great question. Opposition research, probably. But it was always bad form to actually say that to the opposition’s face. “Like I said,” Jen said, “you seemed interesting. And given that the amount of interesting things in this town is close to <em>zero – </em>“</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, so, why are <em>you </em>here?” Mystery Woman interrupted.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, money,” Jen answered honestly. “Lots of money. Really, an absurd amount.”</p><p> </p><p>Todd, the acne-challenged teenager manning the counter that morning, chose that minute to call “Satan’s Niece?”</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman tilted her head. “That’s me.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course it was.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, good luck with the campaign!” Jen called as Mystery Woman/Satan’s Niece deftly grabbed two trays of drinks and headed for the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” Mystery Woman replied as she opened the door with her back. “Good luck with the sabotaging.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, thanks! I don’t need it!” Jen called cheerfully after her with a wave, and had no doubt that if both of her hands hadn’t been occupied by coffee trays, she would have received a casual middle fingered salute. Jen watched her get to her car and set down her trays on the roof.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Todd,” Jen called as he passed by to take out the trash. “That woman, the one who just left. What’s her name?”</p><p> </p><p>Inexplicably, Todd looked back at her with terror on his face. “I… can’t say,” he said.</p><p> </p><p>How deeply uninspiring. She hadn’t even given him a reason to be terrified of her. She had, in fact, been extremely nice to him every single day she’d come in during her interminable stay in Pawnee. “Can’t say, won’t say, what?” Jen pressed. “Come on, I’ve got fifty bucks for the tip jar.” That would probably buy him a decent amount of weed in this town… though she wouldn’t speculate about the quality.</p><p> </p><p>Todd looked tempted, but only for about half a second. “She’ll know,” he said. “I’m not taking the chance.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who, <em>Satan’s Niece?”</em> Jen demanded, incredulous. “What did she do to you?” The possibilities suddenly stretched entertainingly out in front of her. Was it something freaky? God, Jen hoped it was something freaky.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t mind Todd. Her name’s April,” Ellen said as she passed by with armful of dishes for the dishwasher. “Nice girl. She works at City Hall, pops by a couple times a week and gets coffee for the office, usually in the afternoon.”</p><p> </p><p>Huh. ‘Satan’s Niece’ actually did seem more apropos than <em>April. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, Ellen, you’re a gem,” Jen said and glanced out the window again. Mystery Woman – April – had long since disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>Well. God willing, there wasn’t much longer to go in this campaign, and then Jen could go home and would never have to return to this town ever again, and Mystery Woman/Satan’s Niece/April would be just a blip in an otherwise mindnumbing six weeks of Jen’s life that would eventually grind to a merciful end.</p><p> </p><p>For now, there was a meeting she had to take to make that happen. Jen dropped the promised fifty in the tip jar on the way out, making sure to return Ellen’s smile and wave. Two weeks. Two weeks. That was all.</p>

<p>“April, great timing,” Ben said as she slid silently into his office about thirty seconds after Jen Barkley had swept out of it to catch a flight back to Columbus. “Look, <em>we </em>both know he’s a robot, but Jen wants to focus on Murray’s record in the home stretch, so we’re gonna – "</p><p> </p><p>"Who?”</p><p> </p><p>Ben was never one hundred percent on what was going on in April’s brain – actually, he’d been coming to terms with the possibility of any understanding of April he might ever have maxing out at about thirty, thirty-five percent – but right now he was operating at about a ten percent. He raised his eyebrows. “Jen.” Nothing. “Jen <em>Barkley. </em>She – she was literally just here, April. The woman who just left my office.”</p><p> </p><p>April’s expression didn’t register a change in understanding.</p><p> </p><p>“The person we came here to work for,” he tried again, to similar effect. “Do you at least remember her from Leslie’s campaign? She was on Perd Hapley’s show, like – a lot. Aaaaand you’re fucking with me, aren’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>April shrugged, but there was a hint of a smirk that was starting to give her away. Ben was getting better at spotting it. He only had about a twenty percent error margin in either direction. He thought.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, Ben. She was only everywhere all the time,” April said, which at least confirmed <em>that. </em>“I mean, I thought it was kind of weird that you wanted to work for somebody who was trying to destroy Leslie’s dream.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben raised his eyebrows. “But… <em>you</em> were fine with it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m not dating Leslie, so it’s definitely weirder for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben doubted he’d ever get straight answers out of April why she’d agreed to come with him to D.C. as an intern for a congressional campaign, but the questions he had were getting more complex all the time. “I guess that’s true,” he allowed. “I’ll guess I’ll try not to let that get in my head, thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p> </p><p>Oooookay. “So, now that we’re here and not in the middle of Leslie’s campaign, what do you think of Jen, anyway?” Ben asked while they were on the topic of Jen, genuinely curious. Ben himself had been a little apprehensive of taking this job and working with Jen, but like he’d been telling Leslie on their Skype calls, he was surprised by how much he was coming to actually like her. She was still a hurricane, but a hurricane Ben didn’t have to beat, and damn if it wasn't a thrill to get to work with it instead.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” April said, completely deadpan, no expression at all. “I’m obsessed with her.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben squinted at her. Was she fucking with him again? She did really, <em>really</em> like to fuck with him.</p><p> </p><p>“Look, April,” he said just to cover his bases, because that look in her eyes was making him a little nervous. “I know you know this, but just in case: Jen Barkley’s a very powerful and highly connected person. She’s not playing around, especially here, on her own turf.”</p><p> </p><p>April only rolled her eyes and turned away. “Yeah, yeah, I won’t fuck it up for you,” she said as she pushed the door open and left.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, April,” Ben called after her, but the door was already closing behind her. “We need to talk about – okay. Later.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p>                                                        </p><p>So it wasn’t like April went seeking Jennifer Barkley out herself. But it also wasn’t like April could help it if she walked into D.C. campaign headquarters at 10pm on a Friday while April was the only one there.</p><p> </p><p>Ben had gone home hours ago to have a Skype date with Leslie. April’s choices in things to do had been to either go out with the other interns to whatever dumb bar Smellis had picked and hope he didn’t follow her around with giant, terrified, turned-on puppy dog eyes, or molt in the darkness of her own bedroom and try not to listen to the boring lovesick conversation Ben and Leslie were having in the living room. Or whatever conversation they <em>weren’t </em>having, and nope, <em>no, </em>God, get her out, get her <em>out get her out – </em></p><p> </p><p>She’d had her own Skype date with Andy yesterday since Andy was supposed to be out tonight with Tom at the Snakehole. April had told him to go, no reason for them both to be miserable, even if it made her <em>more </em>miserable, and so April had decided to just lean all the way into the misery and stay at the office. In the dark. And the quiet. All the better to commune with the forces of darkness, so.</p><p> </p><p>Which was how the office was when a quiet <em>beep </em>and click of a lock disengaging signaled that someone had used their keycard to get into the office. April’s ears pricked despite herself. Maybe things were actually about to get interesting. Political espionage? A plot to embezzle campaign funds? Stowing a hostage from the principality of Lichtenstein over the weekend where nobody would notice? Agent Burt Macklin coming to rescue Janet Snakehole from an <em>incredibly </em>sad and boring Friday night?</p><p> </p><p>It was none of those things. The quick, confident sound of high heels across the floor resolved into the form of Jennifer Barkley striding directly to Ben’s dark office and poking her head inside. April’s interest shifted as she watched silently.</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, Ben,” Jennifer was saying to herself as she spun back around. “The <em>one time </em>you aren’t the workaholic I know you are.”</p><p> </p><p>Which was about the time she caught sight of April’s form slouched at her desk ten feet away, yelled, and staggered backward.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy <em>shit,” </em>Jennifer shouted, holding one hand against her chest. “Who the fuck are you and what the fuck are you doing here? Actually, before we do anything else,” she said, thinking better of it, and simply fumbled around on the wall until she found a light switch.</p><p> </p><p>April blinked at the onslaught of light and squinted, displeased.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. It’s you,” Jennifer said when she recognized April. “Wait, no, my original question stands. What the fuck <em>are</em> you doing here?”</p><p> </p><p>April decided to stick to the simplest answer. “Uh, I work for Ben.”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer’s look was skeptical, but she said, “Okay. You know, I don’t really care enough to ask follow up questions. Where is Ben, anyway? He’s not picking up his phone.”</p><p> </p><p>April sighed heavily, suddenly intensely sure that she’d made the right call to stay out of the apartment. “Skype date with Leslie.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Ugh,” Jennifer said, wrinkling her nose. “Wait, are you two Pawneeans living together?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup.”</p><p> </p><p>“Adorable,” Jennifer said flatly. “Well, whatever this is is pathetic. And I happen to be in<em> desperate </em>need of a drink. And seeing as how my D.C. campaign coordinator, who is also your roommate, has done the equivalent of putting a sock on his doorknob, come on. Let’s get out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>April sat up. Was her night actually getting interesting? “Wait. Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do I look like I’m joking?” Jennifer demanded with a double handed gesture up and down her body – one April’s eyes followed obediently. “I mean, you’ll have to remind me your name, because I absolutely forgot it five minutes after you told me the first time, but I <em>do </em>remember that you’re not boring. So are you coming or not? Don’t make ask again.”</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Because D.C. was a swamp heated by Satan and the fires of hell, and because Jennifer Barkley was apparently loaded, she called them an Uber Black to take them five blocks.</p><p> </p><p>April wasn’t completely unused to feeling out of place next to ambitious, competent, intelligent, and professionally dressed women in politics, but Leslie had always been kind of an outlier. Leslie would probably say something that would make April want to crawl into a hole about it, like <em>I’ve had the great privilege of watching April grow into the beautiful and competent young woman she is today, </em>give or take a few adjectives and the degree to which April wanted the hole to close over her, but the truth was that she’d just kind of fallen into Leslie’s orbit when she’d been some dumb kid who hadn’t known or cared about anything.</p><p> </p><p>April wasn’t that dumb kid anymore, which also meant she was extremely aware, actually, of the differences between her and Jennifer Barkley. April was still in her work clothes, sure, but Jennifer was on a whole other level with her power suit and pearls and heels and shiny perfect hair. And sure, April was a little afraid of her, but honestly she was also kind of into that. So sue her: April was married, not immune to the effects of hot, rich, powerful older women doing… whatever this was.</p><p> </p><p>“So what’s your angle,” Jen asked around a sip of her drink where they’d managed to get two seats at the bar. “You don’t really strike me as somebody who’s looking for an in in federal politics. Or who’s besties with somebody like Ben Wyatt. But I’ve been wrong before.”</p><p> </p><p>Gross. April hadn’t even meant to get this far in municipal politics. “No,” she deadpanned. “I actually hate everything about everyone, including Ben. And Congressman Murray.”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer only looked bemused. “Okay,” she said, drawing out the word. “What exactly are you doing here, then? Ben’s not incompetent. It’s why I hired him. And he’s too endearingly anal retentive to do anything but surround himself with overachievers. Which is also why I hired him. So what does that make you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, his illegitimate daughter from a summer fling with a Puerto Rican witch. So a nepotism hire, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ben’s what, ten years older than you?” Jennifer said, unimpressed. “Max?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” April conceded. “I’m his current hot young summer fling. Shh. Don’t tell Leslie.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nice try, if Ben weren’t grossly into Leslie. Try again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, <em>I’m </em>the Puerto Rican witch. I hexed him and it all went horribly, horribly wrong and now I’m here, help.”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer only leaned an elbow on the bar and stared at April like she was the most fascinating thing she’d ever seen. “You are so fucking weird,” she said as she leaned her head into her hand. She was definitely at least a little drunk, but April wasn’t going to call her on it.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she said and drained the rest of her own drink.</p><p> </p><p>“But I’m curious, though – do you ever give real answers to these kinds of questions?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, not really,” which was mostly the truth. “You’re a campaign manager – "</p><p> </p><p>“Political consultant,” Jennifer corrected with an unapologetic smile. “I don’t like to be boxed in.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, you’re a <em>political consultant </em>in like, big time federal politics, and you’re out for drinks on a Friday night with me,” April said. “Puerto Rican witch-slash-lowly campaign intern. What does that make <em>you?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Bored,” Jennifer answered and sucked up more of her drink through her straw. “It wasn’t hard to guess that you were, too.”</p><p> </p><p>That was fair. This bar wasn’t exactly screaming “not boring”, though, but it was definitely a step up from where her night had been before Jennifer had shown up.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you really like it in D.C.?” April asked abruptly.</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer gave her a sidelong glance. “You don’t,” she guessed.</p><p> </p><p>April missed Pawnee. “It’s okay, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer stared at her for a minute, halfway to a smile. Then she put down her drink and sat up. “I like being a power broker,” she said. “I like being the one who moves the chess pieces on the board, especially if a ton of those pieces are stupid – and they are,” Jennifer said, rolling her eyes. “God, they are <em>so </em>stupid.” But just as quickly, she got serious again, and said, “I like <em>winning. </em>And I usually do. That’s why everybody comes to me. I’m the best, and they know it.”</p><p> </p><p>“But what’s the point, if everybody’s stupid?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, now you’re sounding like Leslie Knope,” Jennifer said with a smirk; and horrified, April realized she wasn’t wrong. Jennifer laughed. “It’s not a bad thing. I actually like Leslie’s idealism. It's cute. It’s just hard to hang on to. There have always been people moving other people behind the scenes, people tapping other people for other people’s ends. I’d just rather be one of the tappers than one of the tappees.” She trained a shrewd look on April. “You know, I've got a feeling you might, too. Generally speaking, that is.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t even know me,” April said, but her thumbs smoothed compulsively through the condensation on her empty glass over and over and over.</p><p> </p><p>If Jennifer noticed – which she probably did – she didn’t say anything about it. April wasn’t sure if that was better or worse.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, well, you said you were bored,” April said to change the subject. “Are you still bored?”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer’s eyebrow quirked and she turned to face April more fully. “You got something else in mind?”</p><p> </p><p>April took that as a yes and pulled out her phone, flicking to the Uber app. “Yes, Jennifer.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s Jen,” Jen said with a lazy, growing smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, <em>Jen. </em>Finish your drink in…” April’s screen changed as a driver was confirmed. “Seven minutes. And get ready for gay karaoke.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“April? <em>April? </em>Come on, April, wake up and let me know you’re alive.”</p><p> </p><p>April opened one eye and groaned.</p><p> </p><p>“Signs of life!” Ben praised her. “Good morning, sleepyhead.”</p><p> </p><p>He was spending <em>way </em>too much time with Leslie. Because he wasn’t Leslie, April muttered at him to fuck off.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m actually about to,” he said, which meant that he was getting too used to April. “I got a message from Jen this morning that she wants to meet about something before she flies out. I’m not even gonna ask what happened to you last night, but I’ve put a large bowl next to you just in case you need it, and there’s water, Advil, and a granola bar on the table.”</p><p> </p><p>April made flopping motions in the direction of the generic Ikea coffee table without lifting her head. Leslie would have taken pity on her. Back when he’d had been her and Andy’s roommate in Pawnee, awkward and unsure Ben almost definitely would have. Today-Ben just laughed and said, “Yeah, you’re fine. I’ll be back this afternoon. Let me know if you want to have dinner in tonight. Whenever you actually want to think about food, that is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” April said around the fucking cotton balls in her mouth as his earlier words caught up with her. “Jen?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Jen Barkley.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know who Jen Barkley is,” she groaned, irritated. For – God, <em>so </em>many reasons. Jen had texted Ben this morning? She’d gone shot for shot with April! Who the fuck even <em>was </em>she?  </p><p> </p><p>Ben laughed again, the motherfucker. “I’ll see you later. Feel better.”</p><p> </p><p>April flipped him off, but only in her head, because anything else was too much effort. She could always count on Ben to get the idea, though, and he laughed again as he shut and locked the door behind him. Whatever. She hoped his meeting sucked. She hoped Jen’s head was pounding and she was wearing dark sunglasses and that she was kind of a bitch to Ben about it.</p><p> </p><p>If there was a recording on her phone of Jen Barkley drunk off her ass and <em>still </em>managing to perform the shit out of “Since U Been Gone” to a crowd of also drunk-off-their-ass gays screaming with her, who really cared? April was going back home in less than a month, and then she’d probably never see her again. And if April pulled it up later when she finally reached for her phone (sixteen texts from Andy since three in the morning, two from Ben), still slouched down into the couch, nobody really needed to know that, either.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The Main Interior Building wasn’t exactly out of the way from Jen’s last meeting, and given that she had an hour’s worth of flux time before needing to cross the Mall again for the next one, it was a no brainer to make a pit stop and see if she could leverage the element of surprise against Leslie Knope while she was in town.</p><p> </p><p>Danny, the security guard, knew her well; and since Jen had had the foresight to make a call and get herself on the list of expected visitors before showing up, getting up to the floor where she’d been told Leslie had grabbed a temporary office was a breeze. From there, it was just a matter of lightly flirting with the floor’s receptionist-slash-gatekeeper for directions.</p><p> </p><p>The door was ajar. Jen rapped on it perfunctorily and pushed it open without waiting for a response. And inside it was –</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” she said. “I wasn’t expecting you.”</p><p> </p><p>While it wasn’t Leslie Knope who looked up at one of the two desks crammed into this office, Jen was definitely in the right place. It had been what, three, four years since Ben Wyatt had had the temerity to turn down her job offer to fuck off back to Nowheresville, Flyover State and get married? Jen could be excused for not remembering this woman’s name. She also had a hazy recollection of a spectacularly alcohol-soaked night at some gay bar downtown, which probably also hadn’t helped with the memory thing. Hmm. She was pretty sure it was something that started with an “A”. But shorter. A little unexpected, maybe.</p><p> </p><p>“And here I am anyway,” Maybe-Ana said. “Hi, Jen.”</p><p> </p><p>Well, everyone remembered Jen’s name. That wasn’t new. “Hi, yourself,” Jen returned. “So just wondering, since I <em>vaguely </em>recall you saying you didn’t actually want to be in government – should I congratulate you on your new position? What is it they told me? Executive director – “</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, shut up,” Maybe-Amy groaned. “It’s all been a horrible mistake. I shouldn’t be here. I’m catching a cab to the airport and moving to Transylvania to become a vampire.”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm pretty sure it's Romania at this point, but yeah, sure, why not? Live the dream! But before you do, where’s Leslie?”</p><p> </p><p>“Meeting with the Secretary of the Interior. She’s supposed to be done in ten minutes, but he likes to talk, so who knows.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, great. Mind if I set up here?” Jen asked, already moving to the other desk – Leslie’s, presumably – and taking out her iPad.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, sure,” Maybe-Aubrey said, eyeing her skeptically. “But Leslie <em>will </em>kill you if you mess up those files, and I’m not taking the fall for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen almost laughed, incredulous, but was already halfway through replying to an email chain one of her partners had decided to drag her into. “Please. It takes a lot more than an irritated Leslie Knope to scare me. What is she gonna do, give me an insincere compliment?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” was all Not-Ashley said, making it clear that it wasn’t. With practiced ease, Jen ignored this. “Why do you wanna talk to Leslie, anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“I want to convince her to run for Indiana state senate,” Jen said truthfully. “And it’s <em>so </em>much easier doing it here than subjecting myself to a trip to Pawnee and the assorted Knope-Wyatt spawn. Blegh. No, thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence. Jen looked up to see Ava-Abby-Avril (Avril?) shrinking into her chair and back to concentrating on whatever she was working on. Ohhhh, fuck it. Now her curiosity was piqued. “No comments about any of that?” she prodded, just this side of caustic. “Or did I stumble into a sore subject?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s really not your business. Besides, isn’t this where you say you don’t really care?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, <em>ouch</em>. Jen didn’t bother pretending woundedness; she knew how to read a room. It was pretty obvious that it wasn’t the idea of Leslie making a bid for state senator that was bothering her. If Jen <em>did </em>get Leslie to run, and win – which she would, if Jen got her to run – it wasn’t hard to assume that she'd drag Maybe-Avril right along with her to Indianapolis, probably with a title change to chief of staff, and probably also insisting all the way that she hated it.</p><p> </p><p>Surreptitiously, Jen checked her left hand for a wedding ring: still there. Maybe-Avril had to be what, thirty, mid-thirties? Some quick deductions led Jen to a conclusion she felt was probably pretty damn close to the truth. In an extremely rare moment of indecision that she allowed herself only because the room’s only other occupant wasn’t looking, she bit her lip.</p><p> </p><p>But that was the moment that Leslie Knope's voice came from the open door: “Well, well, if it isn’t Jen Barkley."</p><p> </p><p>Jen had to hand it to her, she looked pretty fantastic for somebody who had just grown and squeezed three human beings out of her body. “Glad to see you’ve made yourself comfortable,” Leslie continued with a pointed smile. Jen raised her eyebrows and glanced at Maybe-Avril, who rolled her eyes. “What brings you to the Department of the Interior?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, it's funny you should ask, Leslie,” Jen said. “A little bird told me you were in town.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Leslie said, apparently perplexed. “Well, it’s nice of you to drop in and say hi, Jen, but I don’t think – "</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no,” Jen cut her off before she could get any ideas. “This isn’t a social visit.”</p><p> </p><p>Maybe-Avril stood up and shut her laptop. “I’m gonna give you two the office,” she said, but to Leslie. “Do you want coffee?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why, thank you, April – " <em>April, </em>yes, that was it. “ – you know me so well. Jen, do you – "</p><p> </p><p>But Jen had taken the break to go back to her phone. “Oh, I won’t be staying long,” she clarified, already replying to an email.</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t ask again. “Okay, then, bye,” she said, and then disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that was a little ominous,” Leslie observed, still with that smile as she turned back to face Jen. “So I’m guessing I might not like the answer, but - what can I do for you?"</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Leslie hadn’t gone for it – and eh, it had been a longshot. It had been all <em>I’m flattered, Jen, but I just had triplets, Jen </em>and <em>I just got my dream job, Jen, </em>and <em>I can’t move to Indianapolis right now, Jen!</em></p><p> </p><p>And that was fine. Really. The truth was that Jen actually had her eye on a Knope campaign in four years’ time. Leslie would go home and mention it to Ben, and Ben would work on talking her into it when their life-ruiners times three were old enough to be ruining their lives a little less, and Jen would be primed to hit go on the campaign exactly when she’d planned to do so.</p><p> </p><p>But speaking of life-ruiners and feelings about them –</p><p> </p><p>April was approaching the entrance to the Main Interior Building with a tray holding two coffees to go; and when she spotted Jen leaning against the façade, she briefly stopped and tilted her head. Jen put away her phone. <em>Yeah, you, </em>she didn’t have to say.</p><p> </p><p>April met her halfway. “So? Did you get what you wanted?”</p><p> </p><p>“I did,” Jen confirmed. “But don’t tell Leslie.”</p><p> </p><p>“Which means…”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, she’s not gonna be asking you to move to Indianapolis with her.” Not anytime soon, anyway. She glanced at the tray of coffees, which April moved to hold out of her reach with a look. Jen raised her hands in a gratuitous display of innocence, which did the trick: April’s lips quirked at the corners, just slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” she said, “so you’re still hanging around, why?”</p><p> </p><p>Showtime. Jen grew serious. “Because I’m taking a stab in the dark about things that aren’t my business,” she said bluntly. April's body language shifted immediately into something less comfortable and she looked away, which meant that Jen, as usual, was dead on. “Listen,” she persisted. “Ordinarily, I wouldn’t. But I’m just saying – I’m child-free and <em>ecstatic. </em>If you ever need some of that kind of energy to balance out any other energy you might be getting…”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” April cut her off tightly. “No offense, but I really don’t want to talk about this.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen raised her hands again, this time more sincerely. “Okay,” she said. “But if that changes – " she took a second to procure her business card from the pocket of her blazer – “Leslie mentioned you weren’t leaving until tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>April took it tentatively with her free hand. It was clear when she spotted the number Jen had handwritten at the bottom. “Why do you care?” she asked as she looked up.</p><p> </p><p>Jen shrugged, put on a smile, and shifted her bag over her shoulder in preparation to leave. Honestly, she was pretty much at her limit on this kind of thing for the hour, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“Call me,” she said as she started walking away. “Or don’t! I’m good either way.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was around seven that night that Jen got a text from an unknown number. She flicked it open without thinking about it to discover a video, no text.</p><p> </p><p>That did make her pause. She looked more closely at the thumbnail: a crowd of people in the foreground, some kind of stage in the background, garish lights everywhere. The play button displayed right over the figure who was evidently performing on it. She narrowed her eyes, but another text came through from the same number:</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hey. I never had a number to send this to a few years back. Thought you should have it too.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Huh. Jen clicked play, and was immediately assaulted by the tinny sound of a screaming crowd and… oh, <em>fuck, </em>was this karaoke? Who the hell was butchering this song?</p><p> </p><p>Oh. Oh no. Jen looked closer. Well, at least she looked damn good doing it.</p><p> </p><p>A drunk, tinny voice identifiable as April’s was screaming over the speaker now, too, mercifully overwhelming any recording of past-Jen’s attempt at the bridge. A disbelieving smirk twisted at current-Jen's lips. April had just had this hanging out on her phone for the past three years? </p><p> </p><p><em>Yes, thank you, I do love watching myself perform while spectacularly drunk, </em>she typed back. <em>Was that all? </em></p><p> </p><p>Five minutes went by, before:</p><p> </p><p>
<em>No. I could actually use some of that child-free ecstatic energy if you’re still offering.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jen deliberated a minute, then sent her address. <em>I have wine. And the hard stuff.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Three more minutes. Then, <em>On my way. Eta 20 min</em></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>April looked even more exhausted when Jen opened the door than she had six hours ago.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus,” Jen said. “Come on in. What’s your poison? You look like you need it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, wine’s fine,” April said, looking around. “Great place.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, for the $100k renovation I just did, it’d better be. Come on, through here.”</p><p> </p><p>April immediately abandoned her wine for weed as soon as Jen offered it as a possibility – Jen didn’t blame her – and they retreated to Jen’s patio, passing the joint between them under the light pollution and a just-visible half moon. It was also forty-seven fucking degrees and too cold for this shit, but Jen refused to smoke indoors. She dragged two fleece blankets outside and threw one of them at April. April muttered a ‘<em>thank god’ </em>under her breath, before she another drag off the joint and passed it back off to Jen.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn, that’s good shit,” she said, already looking more relaxed. “Don’t know why I’m surprised.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen exhaled and let the first effects start to curl through her own bloodstream. “Are you actually?” she asked, curious, and cracked her neck before settling back against the sectional, feet propped up on the ottoman.</p><p> </p><p>April laughed lazily from where she was tucked into the corner and held out a demanding hand. “I guess not. Pass it back.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen did so without comment, but let her gaze linger during the hand off. There was something compelling about her, there always had been; that much Jen would probably always remember about her just because of the way it always reasserted itself in Jen's brain and caught there. Chaotic. Unexpected, definitely, and still a little unrefined in a way that made Jen itch to grab hold just for the sake of doing so. Whatever it was had only intensified in the gap of the last few years, aging like the wine they'd both left back on Jen's polished granite kitchen island.</p><p> </p><p>In profile, highlighted by shadow, April was striking, almost absurdly beautiful. Her smooth, dark hair was falling out of its clip and haphazardly into her face, and combined with the purse of her lips around the joint, around the smoke that came after – well, Jen wasn’t usually one to mince words when a woman was hot.</p><p> </p><p>She cleared her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” she said, which got April to look over at her, “so let me guess. You’re surrounded by chaotic little baby Knope-Wyatts and Ben and Leslie doped up on the ‘parenting is so incredible’ train, despite the literal mountains of diapers they’re going through and the singular hour of sleep per night that they’re getting, if they’re lucky, and you’re feeling pressure to produce offspring of your own. Is that an accurate summary of the situation?”</p><p> </p><p>April paused, holding smoke in her lungs. Wordlessly, she passed the joint.</p><p> </p><p>“For a stab in the dark, it’s not terrible,” she admitted once Jen’s mouth was preoccupied. Jen looked at her once she’d exhaled in the opposite direction, only to find April’s eyes resting on her, dark, still, unknowable. </p><p> </p><p>It only took a little encouragement to get April to fill in the particulars. She’d been young when she’d gotten married. Her husband was older than her, and while he was kind and sweet and funny and loved his wife, was also – Jen was reading between the lines, here – not the brightest bulb in the box. They'd never talked about kids before now because they hadn’t really needed or wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>“It wasn’t a whole thing until Ben and Leslie had the triplets," April said, staring at her lap. "But Andy <em>loves </em>kids, and he’d be a great dad, and it would make him so happy…”</p><p> </p><p>“But not you.” Jen scrutinized her face through the darkness - what she could see of it, anyway. “Or there’s more, isn’t there. You said he was like a big kid. Did you mean that in the present tense?”</p><p> </p><p>April burrowed more deeply into the corner, under the blanket. “I feel like a horrible person,” she said, which answered <em>that </em>question.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t,” Jen advised her sharply. “Big kids don't raise actual kids. Sure, he likes wrangling the Knope-Wyatt terrors, probably with supervision, if I had to guess from what you’re saying, but at the end of the day, he’s not actually responsible for them. Of course you hate the idea of having to parent your husband and actual kids simultaneously. Especially when your husband is a <em>forty-five year old man.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“He’s forty-two,” April mumbled, which made Jen roll her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever. I’m just gonna go ahead and say this now. You’re not crazy. But you know what <em>would</em> be crazy? Having kids anyway! Like, yes, I’m sure your husband’s great, he loves you, he’d love his kids, <em>sure</em>. But for the record, if you’re keeping one: you don’t owe kids to anybody. Not your husband, and not Leslie Knope.”</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t respond to this, and Jen briefly thought that she’d stepped over some line bringing Leslie into it, which was really just a hunch. But no: April was only looking at her, eyes dark and inscrutable and reflecting Jen’s words back at herself.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Jen snapped, tensing.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t seem to bother April. “Why did you ask me out for drinks that night?” she asked. <em>Why did you invite me here tonight? </em>Tacit, the words hung suspended in the air between them while Jen stared, caught, and April stared right back. </p><p> </p><p>They kept ending up here, didn't they? <em>Why are you here? Why did you ask me? Why did you come? </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em>Why do you care? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>One beat, two. Jen laughed, brassy and unapologetic, plucked the joint out of April’s fingers and put it to her own mouth. “You’re high,” she observed while smoke escaped around the words.</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t ask again.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Their flight left out of Dulles at 11:30 the next morning, which Jen knew, again, because Leslie had managed to volunteer the information during their brief conversation the day before. Jen didn’t hear from either of them before then, not that she’d really expected to. Still, she paused when a notification popped from an unsaved number around 5:30.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>I don’t think I said it last night so - thank you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jen hesitated with her thumbs over the keyboard. <em>You’re welcome, </em>she replied cautiously. <em>Good luck, either way. </em></p><p> </p><p>There was no response. Jen, having trained it out of herself early, knew how to not take it personally. But she did take a second to save the number as a new contact, just in case.</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The first thing you learned when you worked for a nonprofit was the importance of convincing rich people to give you their money.</p><p> </p><p>Logically, April had known that the whole "no profit" thing combined with the "no government budget" thing meant that her new job was going to be fundraising-adjacent, but she really hadn't thought that she'd find herself at three separate events within the space of six months to be a part of Team "Get Mostly Rich Old White Dudes to Hand Over Their Money". Fortunately, though, it was a team spirit that she could really get behind.</p><p> </p><p>Also fortunately, April could really do events at this point. She had a whole wardrobe of fancy or fancy-adjacent event-wear at this point, leftover from years of first small government functions and award ceremonies and then the soul-crushing political parties here in Washington that Leslie had dragged her to once or twice a year after she'd been enough of a sucker to allow herself to be dragged into a job with a title that included not only <em>Executive Director,</em> but also, worse,<em> of Regional Affairs. </em></p><p> </p><p>This particular event was in a fancy old hotel not far from the Hill, so while it wasn't a "political event", it turned out that April played herself when it came to her decision to move to D.C. Alyssa passed by with a smile and one of the signature cocktails their bar stations were serving tonight: a (ugh) "Sweater Weather". They were delicious, which April knew because she'd intimidated some 25-year-old working one of the bar stations into making her one of them four hours ago during event setup. She'd been sipping on mocktails since then, but if the universe was offering her another one now? She wasn't about to turn it down.</p><p> </p><p>"Hanging in there?" she murmured as she passed April the drink, which April gratefully accepted and took an immediate sip of.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, since you're bringing me alcohol..."</p><p> </p><p>Alyssa laughed. "The name sucks, but the drink slaps, regrettably."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm too far into this event to care," April said with a smile that hopefully looked just the right amount of "deranged witch who can eat your soul" to keep people from approaching her without being too alarmed to do the money handing over thing.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah," Alyssa sighed. "It's just the holiday season. Thanksgiving'll hit in two weeks and we'll be home free. Hey, any Christmas plans? Are you going back to Indiana?"</p><p> </p><p>"Uhhh," April said intelligently, mostly because the crowd in front of them had parted enough to give her a clear view of someone she hadn't seen in a year and a half.</p><p> </p><p>Alyssa followed her gaze and frowned. "Do you know her? I guess I shouldn't be surprised, given your background."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, we've met a few times," April said. So far, so true. "She was technically my boss at one point, I guess. And once she ran a campaign against my other old boss. So. You know. I've seen her around." Done drunk gay karaoke with her. Shared a joint with her. Had the entire direction of her life changed because of her. Whatever. </p><p> </p><p>Alyssa didn't comment, but she did make a face that let April know that some of what she hadn't said had probably come through anyway. "Okay," she said, calmly, as if she totally hadn't. "Well, it might be nice to catch up?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hmm. Yeah. Maybe," April said, noncommittal, and Alyssa wandered away again with a touch to her elbow.</p><p> </p><p>April had wondered a few times if she’d ever run into Jen Barkley again now that she’d moved to D.C., despite the fact that April had pretty much taken herself out of the circles that Jen ran in. Sure, she still had her phone number, but it had felt wrong to reach out. Like, what a weird situation. What would she even say? <em>Hey, remember we got super high when you invited me over and gave me your expensive, fancy weed and you made me think, like really think, about not having kids, actually, and then I went home and thought about it some more and got divorced, so thanks for that? </em></p><p> </p><p>Yeah. April had held off on that one.</p><p> </p><p>Getting divorced sucked. Seriously, just an all around bummer of the highest magnitude. At some point, it had become obvious to April that there was no way around it – that it was either get them both out now or be slowly destroyed by it. It had also been obvious that she’d have to be the one to push it through, the same way she’d pushed Andy for them to get together in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>Andy didn’t get it. Of course he didn’t. He begged, he’d said things he didn’t mean about kids not being <em>that </em>important to him, that what he wanted didn’t matter, that it <em>wouldn’t</em> matter, that he’d keep it under wraps, he’d get over it, he loved her, he loved her so much, he would do literally anything, just please come home, honey, please?</p><p> </p><p>In her sister’s shitty apartment, April had pulled the pillow over her head and screamed. Natalie, proving that sisters didn’t completely suck sometimes, had slid into bed behind her and held her without saying anything.</p><p> </p><p>Donna… kind of got it? Or at least she’d taken her out for dinner and made it clear she supported April and that she was welcome over at her and Joe’s any time. So did Tom, but Tom also still mostly didn’t know how to say anything and mean it unless Lucy was standing right behind him. She honestly didn’t know if Ron got it, really, but he’d taken her out to his secret cabin that somehow Diane still didn’t know about and hung out in mostly silence with her for two days. Ben pretended he got it, and kept texting her to ask how she was doing.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie, of course, didn’t get it at all, and kept leaving April voicemails that trailed off into some variation of <em>but maybe if you and Andy just talked </em>that April immediately deleted before she had a panic attack.</p><p> </p><p>In the end, April had moved to D.C. on her own. Ben had been waiting at her new place when April pulled up half an hour ahead of the movers, and then, because of course Ben had brought it, she’d been enough of a loser to play his stupid game with the stupid cones with him for <em>multiple</em> hours, surrounded by boxes and bare white walls clawing and shrieking at her that she’d made all the wrong moves. Neither of them had acknowledged the boxes he’d left on her kitchen counter that contained: a large potted Venus Fly Trap (which, yeah, okay; it was cool), basic groceries, a $100 gift card for GrubHub, a framed photo of the old Parks and Rec crew, another one of just her and Leslie, and a twenty-three-page handwritten letter that April still hadn’t been able to bring herself to read.</p><p> </p><p>And after all that, it had taken until last month for the divorce papers to come in the mail. April had signed them without reading them, put them back in the envelope, then drunk an entire bottle of wine.</p><p> </p><p>So, yeah – no. April hadn’t reached out to Jen Barkley.</p><p> </p><p>But all that was behind her. And today, right now, April wasn’t thinking about any of it, because Jen had finally clocked that someone was looking at her and had shifted her body to look back. Her head tilted; a smirk hinted at her mouth. April stared until one of Jen’s eyebrows raised in what was obviously an invitation.</p><p> </p><p>And, yeah. Okay. Yeah.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” she said after she’d taken it, slowing to a stop a step or two away from her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Jen parroted back, looking her up and down with a casually appraising look. “I’d been wondering how you were doing. What brings you to this overblown dog and pony show? I haven’t seen Leslie around; wouldn’t have thought I’d see Parks people at this one. Unless I got my wires crossed. Unlikely; it’s <em>me</em>. But just between you and me, this is like, the third one of these things I’ve been to this week, so.”</p><p> </p><p>She punctuated this by taking a long sip of the wine she was holding and then setting down the empty glass on a passing server’s tray. Then she fixed her gaze back on April, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, uh, I don’t think she’s here,” April said, starting with the Leslie question. She hoped not, anyway. “I don’t work for her, anymore – I’m with the Foundation.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really.” Jen’s gaze was as piercing as it ever was. “Should I say congratulations?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure. I mean, yeah. Congratulate me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Congratulations,” Jen said, voice dry. “We’re not talking about the not working for Leslie thing, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Well, if she was giving April the option. “Nope.”</p><p> </p><p>In a motion so quick April might have missed it if she wasn’t watching Jen so closely, Jen’s eyes flicked down to her left hand. Her bare left hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Jen agreed, and in a move April should have seen coming, breezed right past it. “Then how’s about I buy you a drink at this open bar?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Once – okay, twice. Fine, <em>three times, </em>fuck – in the last few months, April had woken up conflicted and horny from a dream where Jennifer Barkley was shotgunning smoke into her mouth while April deliberately pressed her hips down into her lap.</p><p> </p><p>And no, it hadn’t actually happened. But the higher April had gotten out there on Jen’s freezing patio all those months ago, the more fixated she’d gotten on the way the smoke had escaped Jen’s lips. Even curled up under that insanely soft fleece blanket, she’d looked powerful. Really fucking powerful. Maybe it was actually the blanket that had heightened the contrast between professional Jen the Shark and domestic Jen at Home. All April knew was that it had triggered her basest instincts to climb over her without a word, seal their mouths together, and see if she’d exhale with April’s commanding hands holding her neck in place.</p><p> </p><p>April really had no idea why somebody like Jen Barkley was interested in her. But here they were. Again.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, so, I’m not married anymore,” April blurted out before she could second guess herself.</p><p> </p><p>Next to her, Jen paused. “Okay,” she said, slowly. “Just to be crystal clear – was that an invitation?”</p><p> </p><p>April took a minute to make sure on a deep breath, then nodded. “Yeah. I think so,” she said, and then plowed right into, “So do you wanna make out with me, or what?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen ducked her head to hide the way she was biting her smile. Was that calculated to make April want to do it for her? Because it was working. “Yeah,” Jen said, an easy, low admission, “I do,” and then curled her hand firmly around April’s wrist. One finger teased over the thin skin over April’s veins, and she laughed when April jumped. <em>Do it again, </em>she didn’t demand, <em>dig your nails in, make me bleed, let me see it.</em></p><p> </p><p>If anybody noticed Jen leading her to the bathrooms by the wrist, April couldn’t tell. The bathrooms themselves were ridiculously opulent, single stall with a sink and a closed door situations, and Jen looked furtively around before ducking them inside one of them. April instinctively hopped up on the marble counter next to the sink while Jen locked the door, which was the right move: Jen stepped immediately between her legs and crowded her space. Fuck. April’s stomach dipped. Why was this already so hot?</p><p> </p><p>“This okay?” Jen asked as she cupped her cheek, eyes already fixed on April’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>Yes. <em>Obviously</em>. April didn’t want to think about it, okay. She didn’t want to <em>think</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up,” she said, buzzing and high on adrenaline and want, and kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Jen immediately took whatever control April might have had in making the first move, her tongue sweeping bold and <em>God, </em>fucking talented, into April’s mouth. April was bisexual, but it had been a long time since she’d made out with a girl or gotten a hand up one’s shirt, and she’d been young and stupid and mostly drunk whenever that actually had happened.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t drunk now. Honestly, she couldn’t remember feeling this overstimulated from any kiss before while she was sober. Jen’s tongue was doing things to her mouth that made her ears ring with static and her fingers buzz. Distantly, April was aware that her hair was being pulled, and the edge of pain made the way Jen was starting to suck on her tongue – <em>fuck </em>– <em>so </em>fucking good. Maybe it was just that it was different; maybe it was that this was somehow the first thing that had felt solid since April left Pawnee. Either way, April was making noises she didn’t think she’d ever made before, from a <em>kiss, </em>which made Jen laugh and do it again, do it more.</p><p> </p><p><em>“Fuck,” </em>April said emphatically when they broke apart, gasping for air. She felt like a wreck. She <em>was </em>a wreck. She’d wrapped her legs around Jen’s waist somewhere in the middle of it, and her dress was pushed up to her waist. More electric still was the way the rough fabric of Jen’s no doubt ridiculously expensive sheath dress felt against her inner thighs, teasing against her naked cunt.</p><p> </p><p>“How are you doing?” Jen said on a giggle. A <em>giggle. </em>Fuck, <em>fuck. </em>Jen’s palm slid up and down the outside of April’s left thigh where it had planted itself, firm and possessive, when April had been focused on other things.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d let you fuck me right here if you wanted to,” April said honestly and let her head fall back against the mirror with a thud. “Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>“Now <em>that’s </em>an invitation,” Jen said on another laugh, voice low enough that it made April shiver against her. Jen was obviously interested in taking her up on it: her hand stuttered on April’s thigh, she was biting her lower lip while staring at April’s, again, and her other hand had tightened unconsciously against the small of April’s back and brought her hips tighter between April’s legs. April wasn’t proud of the whimper she made.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” April said once she’d gotten some steadiness back in her voice. “Then fuck me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Jen said, eyes darkening, fingers already moving to dip between their bodies, between April’s spread legs. “Right here, right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re a fucking coward,” April demanded, grabbing her own handful of Jen’s hair. “Fucking <em>fuck </em>me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I will,” Jen promised, voice rough with the truth of it, and April could feel it in the way her fingers were already splitting the lips of her cunt. “You’re already wet. No underwear – were you planning this?” And no, but that <em>really didn’t fucking matter </em>when her fingers slipped right inside April while her magical thumb got to work on and around April’s clit.</p><p> </p><p>Nobody had ever accused April of being quiet during sex, but her one concession to public sex in a place that might get her fired was that she usually tried to keep her voice down.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Jen said, and her voice was commanding enough that April wrenched her eyes open. “Fuck that. Let me hear you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Congress,” April managed while Jen’s slender, knowing fingers hooked and fuck, fuck, <em>fuck, </em>twisted and dragged inside her, and then did it again. Shit, <em>how </em>was she doing that? “Or whatever.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why don’t you just trust me to handle it, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“You <em>freak,” </em>April moaned, delighted. “You fucking megalomaniac.”</p><p> </p><p>“Never had complaints before,” Jen said with a breathy note to her voice that just spun April higher. “Come on, baby, give it to me.”</p><p> </p><p>April wanted Jen on her knees with her face covered in April’s come. She wanted Jen’s entire hand inside of her. She wanted to slap the smug smirk off her face and make her beg or come or both until she cried. She never, ever wanted Jen to stop what she was doing right now between her legs, with an entire ballroom of pretentious politicians and rich people listening to how insanely good it felt to have Jennifer Barkley fingering her in this stupid, fancy bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>When April came, it was with a moan that echoed obscenely off the marble, with Jen biting down on April’s lower lip, with two handfuls of Jen’s hair in April’s fists; and when it was over, she slouched panting and boneless against the mirror. Jen followed her, kissing her even more messily than during the makeout session that had gotten them here, and April felt hot, overwhelmed, lipstick smeared across her face and two seconds away from coming again.</p><p> </p><p>Until Jen straightened up and fixed her clothes and dug around in her abandoned purse for tissues and makeup, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that was fun,” she said, bright and apparently totally sincere as she touched up her lipstick in the mirror next to April, and then gave her a sideways glance. “You good?”</p><p> </p><p>April was incredible, but a little confused. “Yeah,” she said while her brain tried to start up again. “Wait, are <em>you?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Jen laughed and capped her lipstick, apparently satisfied with what she saw in the mirror, and dropped it back in her bag. “Are you kidding? This’ll power me through the next two hours. But at the end of those two hours I wouldn’t say no if you wanted to come back to my place. Here, you’ve got some – "</p><p> </p><p>April took the tissues Jen was offering her, stared at them blankly, and then laughed. This was insane, wasn't it? She felt insane. She felt <em>amazing.</em> </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” she said, waving away Jen’s impatient concern again while she attacked the mess around her mouth. “Can I borrow – "</p><p> </p><p>Jen was already thrusting a comb and a different tube of lipstick at her. “This should get you out the door, if you wait another few minutes. Probably not a good idea to stick around, though.”</p><p> </p><p>“But it is for you?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Oh, you mean because of the – " Jen gestured vaguely in a way that April guessed was supposed to mean <em>the way you moaned loud enough that there should be cops outside waiting to arrest us on public indecency. </em>“No,” she said on a cackle. “Oh, no. These things are almost completely soundproof. The CIA used to have meetings in here. I mean, who did they think they were kidding, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, really?” April said, intrigued.</p><p> </p><p>“That or they were doing what we were just doing. To be fair, it was probably some of both. But with penises, though, mostly. Central Intelligence has historically hated to see a lady winning. Or, you know. <em>Hear </em>a lady winning.” She finished up with her makeup, checked her dress – which was fine again, somehow – and was clearly satisfied with what she saw. She turned to April, who had managed to sit up and tug her own dress back down her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“So I’ll see you later?” Jen said expectantly.</p><p> </p><p>April thought about it - but not for long.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” April said. “I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to come down in person,” Ben had said over the phone. “I’m pretty sure we can handle this at local campaign HQ and recap with you virtually afterwards on strategy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ben!” Jen said, outraged. “Just what kind of campaign manager do you think I am?”</p><p> </p><p>“One who probably has bigger and better things to do and is almost certainly handling this one as a favor?”</p><p> </p><p>Okay, he wasn’t exactly wrong about that one. It was true that Jen hadn’t wanted anybody but herself handling this campaign for her own reasons. One of those reasons being that she’d done the math and run the numbers and was absolutely playing the long game for a presidential campaign in the next eighteen to twenty-two years.</p><p> </p><p>Not that either of the Knope-Wyatts needed to be let in on that little secret just yet. She could get Ben there. She was pretty sure she could get Leslie there, too. Although it would be a bigger sell with the whole woman thing and the American public’s demonstrated aversion to the idea of POTUS having a uterus. But she wasn’t a goddamn magician – one of them had to actually land themselves an entry level spot on the big boys and girls’ chessboard first.</p><p> </p><p>This was how Jen found herself in Pawnee – Indiana, in case there was any doubt – on a Thursday night after a town hall in the race that was just starting to heat up for Indiana’s 9<sup>th</sup> congressional district. It had, in fact, been a pretty great early boost for Team Wyatt 2018. Jen expected that her minion’s minions would be reporting back very nice poll numbers and favorable news coverage over the coming weeks.</p><p> </p><p>Yes, Jen thought with satisfaction as the backmost lights in the auditorium were cut with a <em>thud. </em>This was all shaping up according to plan.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that went well,” she told Ben as he gathered the last of his things after seeing off the rest of his staffers with a congenial wave. “Great job.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” Ben said, clearly pleased. “And thanks again for coming all the way out. I know we haven’t even started really ramping up yet, and this was just a local event.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s my job, Ben,” Jen reminded him. “Gotta start this campaign out strong. And I mean, your history when dealing with press has historically not been ideal, let’s say, so – “</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, what do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen raised her eyebrows. “I looked you up, Ben, before we met,” she explained slowly. “You had just been trying to promote some little hay and horses shindig here in Pawnee?”</p><p> </p><p>“The Harvest Festival,” Ben corrected.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” said Jen. “You’d done a few spots on local radio and television?” She trailed off and let her face convey the sentiment of <em>yikes.</em></p><p> </p><p>Ben looked mortified, which meant he knew exactly and specifically what she was talking about. “No. You – I mean. <em>How – ?”</em></p><p> </p><p>“Oh, everyone’s seen it, Ben,” Jen dismissed briskly. “Did you really think you could say something like <em>‘Who hasn’t had gay thoughts?’</em> on a talk show and the internet wouldn’t put it on YouTube and make a meme out of it? Not that I’m disagreeing with the sentiment, by the way,” she clarified.</p><p> </p><p>Ben had pulled out his phone and run a search while she was talking, and his face had gone white. Jen bet it was the GIFs. “Oh my god,” he said. “How are you backing me right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you kidding?” Jen said with a laugh. “This is <em>fun</em>. Sure, you’d be DOA if you were running on a Republican ticket, but initial polling has already got you as a favorite in the 18-29 age brackets. You’ve got momentum, Wyatt.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s something,” Ben agreed, but dubiously. Jen laughed again and filed away the rest of her own materials in her briefcase.</p><p> </p><p>“It is,” she agreed. “So, I gave your local team instructions for the next week. Let’s catch up next Friday?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, sure, of course,” he said, but before Jen could put a final cap on it, Ben continued: “Hey, do you want to grab dinner before you head to the airport? I know you’ve got a redeye, and there are some new spots that have popped up since the town merger that I think you’d actually like.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen chuckled and got out her phone to scan her emails. “Why?” she asked as she unlocked it.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, there’s this one place that does Turkish – “</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Jen said, glancing up, “I mean, why would we go out for dinner?”</p><p> </p><p>Ben had known her for too long to be offended. His voice was nonplussed when he said, “Well, I like to think we’re friends, at this point.”</p><p> </p><p>This casual assertion <em>did </em>get Jen’s attention, and Ben raised his hands when she looked up sharply.</p><p> </p><p>“Or… we aren’t?” he revised; but no, Jen was already rapidly realizing with dismay, he was right the first time, wasn’t he?</p><p> </p><p>God fucking dammit. Who could have foreseen that the stupidest, most meaningless moneygrab of her career would have led to a place like Pawnee, Indiana getting its claws in her <em>this </em>thoroughly? Jesus.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t correct him one way or another. And really, what <em>was </em>she going to do until her flight? Live large in Indianapolis? At ten o’clock on a Thursday?</p><p> </p><p>“You’re buying,” she said as she got up and slung her purse over her shoulder. “Well, come on, Ben; lead the way.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Now, Jen had always been able to admit where she was wrong or her assessment had changed, and this was true even when it came to the rapid transformation of Pawnee over the last six years from a stagnant nowheresville overrun by raccoons and fast food joints to a place that actually had legitimate small-town charm.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie’s town merger plan had been brilliant. Jen had thought so as soon as she’d heard about it, and had complimented her on it the first time she’d seen her again in person afterwards.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie had demurred and laughed her way through saying things she really, actually meant like “it was the right thing to do” and “it was the only way to save Eagleton” and “we help our neighbors around here” and then, finally, in a confidential undertone, “I mean, I wanted to throw up the whole time I was doing it, but, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t know, but more to the point, didn’t care, and had simply moved on by telling Leslie she’d been discussing it with some of her contacts in the DNC, who were also all similarly impressed.</p><p> </p><p>“No, Jen, you don’t have to – “ Leslie had said, but Jen was used to this song and dance, and only winked exaggeratedly. Oh come on, it was <em>fun. </em>Leslie blushed, grimaced in a way that wasn’t <em>not </em>a smile, said, reprovingly, “Jen.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome,” Jen said, already dancing her way out of the conversation and halfway out of the room they were both in. “This one’s on me.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Jen.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“But if you wanna start thinking about the growing tab you’ve got with me, 2026 is just around the corner.”</p><p> </p><p>“2026?” Leslie echoed, alarmed, but underneath it… “What’s in 2026?”</p><p> </p><p>And there was the curious ambition Jen could always count on. She grinned. “Get those wheels turning, Knope. Great chatting, gotta go.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, Jen – “</p><p> </p><p>There was simply no denying it: Pawnee had become an attractive place to live. Out of curiosity, Jen strolled through something they were calling “the commons”, which, besides having Leslie’s fingerprints <em>all </em>over it, was lined with townhouses and upscale apartment communities. (Or as upscale as apartment communities could get in Indiana; it was nice, but come on, they were still an hour and a half away from anything resembling an actual city in the Midwest.) The biggest street leading away from the park was thriving with new businesses, <em>actual </em>businesses, and bougie little restaurants and cafes with hipsters spilling out of them.</p><p> </p><p>One of them was her old hideout from the bygone Bobby Newport days, The Daily Grind, which she stopped into purely out of curiosity to find that Todd, now fully an adult, had solved his acne, was working on his online MBA, and had been promoted to manager. Ellen was reportedly on an Alaskan cruise with her son and was having the time of her life taking helicopter tours and playing with sled dogs. The wallpaper had changed; the booths had been renovated. Nothing looked the same, but still Jen walked out with her usual latte on the house and a genuine ‘<em>Hey, it was nice to see you again, Ms. Barkley’ </em>from Todd.</p><p> </p><p>Weirdly, though, this left Jen with the feeling that something… wasn’t <em>wrong, </em>per se, but like something was crawling up her back. Like something was here, just under the surface, waiting for her to name it.</p><p> </p><p>The Pawnee experience had always been something of an absurdist horror/comedy to her, so this was more of a genre shift than something totally out of left field. At this point she was ready to chalk it up to how rarely she returned to a place – any place – after a campaign was done. Usually she was in and out in a few weeks or months by virtue of the job. But Pawnee just kept sucking her back in, and it was getting harder and harder not to notice.</p><p> </p><p>Tonight, Ben ushered her to one of those same restaurants she’d taken note of near the commons: the promised Turkish place, which managed to straddle the line between laidback and upscale. Jen was begrudgingly impressed.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Ben said when they were seated, “how are things back in D.C.?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen looked up from her phone at him in surprise. “You mean… you’re asking about my personal life?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, yeah,” Ben said, nonplussed. “It’s kind of what friends do.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen leaned back in her chair. Things in D.C. were great. Her personal life was incredible. But she doubted that Ben Wyatt was ready to actually hear about the reason why: namely, that she was having a lot of really, really, <em>really</em> good sex, and frequently.</p><p> </p><p>She’d made a point of making damn sure she had an amazing sex life pretty much from the moment she realized she loved sex. And also that she happened to be incredible at it. Jen loved being incredible at things almost as much as she loved sex. Maybe more. Who was keeping track? When you were both things, like Jen, you could afford to not look too closely.</p><p> </p><p>The problem with most people was that they became predictable after a few proverbial rolls in the hay. And what Jen <em>didn’t </em>love was being bored. Especially during something she loved. It wasn’t her fault that she was so spectacular at sex that nobody could keep up with her. Time for everybody else to level up and thank her for the push.</p><p> </p><p>However. When it came to April Ludgate –</p><p> </p><p>Her phone chimed with a text notification.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hey when do you get back? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jen hesitated for long enough with her hand over the phone without picking it up that Ben noticed.</p><p> </p><p>“Jen?” he prompted, which was enough to push her into motion.</p><p> </p><p><em>Late tonight, </em>she typed back while simultaneously saying aloud in response to Ben’s original question, “It’s good. I’m good.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben paused to connect the dots, then chuckled. “Forthcoming,” he said as Jen put her phone back down and reached instead for one of the flatbreads in the bread basket.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay, I see. What do you want me to say?” she asked through a mouthful of bazlama. <em>Fuck </em>this was good. Why couldn’t Pawnee have gotten decent culinary options while she’d been stuck here for six consecutive brain-killing weeks?</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, that’s really up to you,” Ben said, eyeing her as she tore off another piece and stuffed it in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re really from the Midwest, aren’t you. Come on, hit me if you’re going to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Well, maybe this is a stupid question, but are you seeing anybody?”</p><p> </p><p>In perfect timing, her phone lit up with another notification. Thank god Ben was in fact from the Midwest and too polite to snoop. Jen snatched up her phone again anyway. Ben watched the movement, way too amused for his own good.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that a yes?” he teased her. Jen ignored him and read the text:</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Yeah but what time? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She frowned. <em>Late, </em>she typed back. <em>Around 2. </em></p><p> </p><p>To Ben, she said, “No.” And then, smiling brightly, she continued, “but I am having an insane amount of killer sex.”</p><p> </p><p>“O-kay!” Ben said, just a hair too loudly, and Jen smiled as she took a satisfied sip of her water. “Well. I didn’t think that was new, exactly. For you. Is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Aww, Ben,” Jen said, amused. “Did you want the details? Because let me tell you – “</p><p> </p><p>“No!” he said in a hurry. “No, no, actually, that’s okay. I’m uh, I’m happy for you, though.”</p><p> </p><p>He probably meant it, too. Oh, Ben.</p><p> </p><p>Wait, was Jen actually feeling affectionate about it? Worse, was Ben smiling like that because he could tell she was?</p><p> </p><p>“It’s really nice to see you again, Jen,” which felt like the answer to that, and oh god, was he always this earnest? Jen fought not to wrinkle her nose. “I hope you don’t mind me saying, you seem really happy.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re lucky I don’t mind you saying it, Wyatt,” Jen said dryly. “Just make sure you don’t make yourself too comfortable about it.</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, Ben just chuckled again. “I don’t think that’s a problem.”</p><p> </p><p>But Jen barely heard him, distracted by another table on the other end of the restaurant. Two women were seated together, probably a mother and daughter, both with dark hair, though Jen could tell that Mom’s was a bottle-job. Mom was also obviously an incurable hand talker, all big gestures and bigger expressions. The daughter, though, was exactly the opposite. Both were familiar, and Jen wondered…</p><p> </p><p>And there was that weird feeling again, settling over Jen’s chest. Like she was missing something. Like something was missing.</p><p> </p><p>Ben turned around to follow her gaze, and then looked back at her, surprised. “Oh. Do you know them?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t. Not even sort of. She shook herself out of it and said, “No.” Then she smiled winningly. “Hey, are you gonna eat that last flatbread? And where’s our server? I’d actually kill for some hummus.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Ben said his goodbyes and wished her a safe flight when he dropped her off at her rental car, still parked outside the auditorium, at a quarter to 10.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure you’re safe to drive?” he’d asked, concerned, but Jen brushed him off. What was gonna happen to her in the hour and a half drive to Indianapolis – a cow wandering off a field?</p><p> </p><p>The thought made her sober, though, remembering an incident in Ohio. Yeah. She’d watch out for rogue cows.</p><p> </p><p>Pawnee was in her rearview in about five minutes, and with that done, Jen let herself think for the first time since she’d landed in Indiana on Tuesday about April Ludgate.</p><p> </p><p>Jen had only made the mistake of commenting on Pawnee’s dramatic evolution to April once. They’d just gotten back, separately, from their separate trips to Pawnee, neither of which had had anything to do with each other. April had been in town for a wedding. Jen remembered this because she’d taken great pleasure in fucking her in her purple bridesmaid dress against her hotel room door. Jen, for completely unrelated reasons, had chosen to get a last-minute flight to Indianapolis, rent a car, drive to Pawnee, and divebomb the Knope-Wyatts with a campaign pitch. Which, obviously, had worked out brilliantly.</p><p> </p><p>The conversation with April had gone less so, because it hadn’t really gone at all. Jen had mentioned something about Pawnee’s exploding population, and April had said “ha ha” and clammed up.</p><p> </p><p>And okay, sure, Jen had thought; that was her bad. There were after all some recent wounds there, what with the whole divorce thing and the family thing and the whatever had actually gone down with Leslie thing.</p><p> </p><p>But even taking that into consideration, April had been remarkably untalkative about Jen’s trips to Pawnee over the last few months, ever since the initial trip after Ben accidentally – and hilariously – pulled the ol’ campaign trigger.</p><p> </p><p><em>That </em>conversation had gone a little like this:</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>JEN: Hey, you know Ben Wyatt’s running for Congress, right?</p>
<p>APRIL: Yeah, he spilled about it at Donna’s wedding last month. Why?</p>
<p>JEN: Because I’m going to Pawnee on Thursday to coordinate with Ben’s local campaign staff.</p>
<p>APRIL: [pause] Okay. Was… that an invitation, or…</p>
<p>JEN: Oh. No. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>APRIL: So. Just an FYI?</p>
<p>JEN: Yes. I can hear now how it came across, though. Whoops.</p>
<p>APRIL: Okay. Well, good, because I didn’t wanna go, anyway.</p>
<p>JEN: Well, good.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>So clearly, any awkwardness: completely avoided. Dodged. One thousand percent. Great job as usual, Jen.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s flight was too small to have a first-class cabin, but at least the fact that it was scheduled to leave at 1:15 a.m. meant that it was half-full at best. It was nearly 2:30 by the time they deplaned, but at least the route to escape to the rideshare pickup point was a familiar one. Jen exited through baggage claim and rifled through her apps as she joined the thin crowd of stragglers on the curb who were also trying to get the fuck out of here.</p><p> </p><p>Her thumb was hovering over the “select ride” button when a voice called out, “Hey, you’re not really gonna call a ride when I drove all the way out here, are you?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s head whipped up. So did everybody else’s, but Jen’s focus was on the speaker, who was about twenty feet away.</p><p> </p><p>“Is she talking to you?” asked some guy who’d just come outside with a tuba case six inches away from dragging on the ground next to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Obviously she’s talking to me,” Jen replied, irritated at the idea of an alternative, and walked away from him towards the spot where April Ludgate, in the flesh, was standing around waiting for her.</p><p> </p><p><em>What the hell are you doing here? </em>Jen managed to not say, but only just. “Why are you here?” was the question she actually got out, which was marginally better.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess… I wanted to see you,” April said with a shrug, only meeting her eyes at the end. “Weird, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen stared at her, tilted her head. April’s lips were quirked just slightly into something that wasn’t quite a smile. Oh, something was happening, here, wasn’t it?</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” she agreed after a moment. “Pretty weird.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>And it <em>was </em>weird. It was weird as fuck.</p><p> </p><p>April led them to the garage and then down to the first level with Jen trailing behind her and intentionally not asking any of the several questions she had. Questions like <em>How long were you waiting out there? </em>and <em>When, exactly, did you decide to come out here? </em>and <em>Why this time? </em>Other questions like <em>Is this supposed to mean something </em>Jen eschewed as too easy. Obviously it meant something. The question was what, and what Jen was going to do about it.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, are you okay?” April eventually asked, and Jen jumped as April turned around to face her. “You’re being weird. What’s going on with you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Jen muttered, and tugged her briefcase more tightly over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Because you can go back and get yourself your fancy Uber if you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“And if I don’t want to?” Jen challenged.</p><p> </p><p>April raised her eyebrows. “Then… maybe you stop acting like a weirdo and give me your suitcase. And then I drive you home.” </p><p> </p><p>Wordlessly, Jen raised her eyebrows in return, stopped, and offered April the handle of her suitcase. April gave her the ghost of a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” she said and started walking again. “You can sleep in the car. I promise not to even draw on your face.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you trying to say something about the way I look?” Jen sniped, but tellingly, without any bite at all.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yeah,” April deadpanned, “I knew I was forgetting something. You look like shit.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, alright,” Jen grumbled as April grinned, this time widely, before her expression settled back into something more earnest.</p><p> </p><p>“So seriously, why are you making such a big deal of this?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not making a big deal of this!” Jen protested, reaching for the handy stash of affected innocence she kept for just these kinds of situations.</p><p> </p><p>To which April rolled her eyes. “Yeah, well, you’re not <em>not </em>making a big deal of this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, fine,” Jen said, and stopped walking. “Let’s get it out. Are you upset with me?”</p><p> </p><p>April’s surprise seemed genuine, and so did the laugh that followed. “Uh, no? Why would I be mad at you? Also, why would I have come all the way out to Dulles to give you a ride if I was mad at you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, I don’t know!” Jen exclaimed. Why did April do anything she did? Why <em>was </em>April here? Jen didn’t know, that was for sure! “You’re upset every time I go to Pawnee. Don’t pretend you’re not."</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t deny it, at least. “Okay. Well, did you ever consider that it has more to do with Pawnee than you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Jen allowed, “but it doesn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>April laughed again, and turned and started walking past the endless rows of cars. “You are so unbelievable.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I know,” Jen said as she followed her, earning her a scoff. “But that doesn’t answer my question.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m not upset with you! God.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen ignored this lie. “Because I think you want to go to Pawnee. And I can’t figure out if you want to go on your own or if you want to go with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to go back to Pawnee,” April insisted. “And anyway, I was just there, for Donna’s wedding. Remember?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, Jen remembered, but she ignored this – and April’s leer – too. Jen had known April for what, five, six years now? She talked a good game but it was obvious to anyone with the fortitude to look past it that Pawnee had molded and formed her. Take the Pawnee out of the girl and she’d collapse into a puddle on the cement under their feet. What had also long, <em>long</em> since been clear to Jen, but only recently in ways she could fully appreciate, was how April had likewise molded and formed Pawnee.</p><p> </p><p>This was a sleeper talent, one April herself had also only recently become aware of, but not to its full extent. Not yet. Thank god, because it was also a talent that Jen wasn’t stupid enough not to be terrified of.</p><p> </p><p>They’d reached April’s car. April stopped again, turned, and caught something in Jen’s expression before Jen could retract it.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” April asked.  </p><p> </p><p>Jen moved rather than answer. While April wasn’t ready for her, she got there quick enough, moaning into a kiss that was almost immediately hot and open-mouthed. April’s ass hit the trunk of her car and they stumbled together as it shifted under their combined momentum, but it didn’t override the sensation of April’s grasping hands sliding restless over Jen’s back and into her hair, or her tongue sliding against Jen’s in a way that had Jen moaning back like language.</p><p> </p><p>“You taste like an airplane,” April complained into the space between their lips before Jen took control again.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not a thing,” Jen dismissed. Her voice was already short of breath. “Unlock the car.”</p><p> </p><p>April’s expression was hard to parse. But then there was the quiet, echoing <em>beep </em>indicating that the car had unlocked. “After you,” she said.  </p><p> </p><p>And Jen had never needed an engraved invitation. April handled the suitcase. Jen took the opportunity to strip off her tired blazer and kick off her shoes, and was in the middle of wet wiping her hands down when April climbed on top of her in the passenger seat and closed the door.</p><p> </p><p>“So, just to confirm,” April said, eyeing the wet wipes and taking one for herself, “we’re doing this? Here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Unless you have an objection,” Jen said. April was braless under her long sleeved shirt – no surprise there – and probably also commando under her jeans. Jen’s fingers were already itching to find out, and she let them dance over the hot denim seam separating her from April’s cunt. April pressed downward into her hand. Jen bit her lip, looked up to find April staring back, face in shadow.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said, and kissed her. Finally.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, can you just – " Jen started when they broke apart, but her words were interrupted by April grabbing her wrists and pinning them against the seat next to Jen’s shoulders, just below the headrest. Her eyes were intense, alive, thrumming with an energy that she was channeling directly into Jen as she moved her hands down, down, until she was pressing them against the seat on either side of Jen’s thighs. Jen swallowed, but held her head higher. Oh, she was in. She was <em>in. </em></p><p> </p><p>Which was good, because April was leaning into her ear. “Don’t worry. I know what you want. I know what you need,” she murmured into Jen’s ear, then dug her nails into Jen’s hands. “Sit on them,” she said, then tongued at her earlobe, swirled the tip around the tasteful pearl stud Jen wore, curling around the metal of the post back. “Up,” she prompted when Jen’s breathing stuttered and her hands flexed involuntarily, even as she willingly tucked them under her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>It was blindingly obvious what was going to happen from here, and so Jen was the opposite of surprised when April rose up on her knees, undid her fly, and slipped her hand into her jeans.</p><p> </p><p>“Imagine what your clients would say if they could see you now,” April told her, voice hypnotic enough that Jen listened. “All those uptight, old white men. They think you’re a shark, they’ve handed over their whole futures to you. They think you can give them power, and here you are, sitting on your fucking hands because I told you to. Just taking whatever I tell you to. Because you <em>asked </em>for it. At three in the morning in an airport parking garage.” April laughed, and the sound was maniacal. Jen was getting used to the fact that April was crazy, but that didn’t mean that it had stopped being a turn on yet.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this punishment,” Jen asked, mouth dry. “You’re punishing me, right? For going to Pawnee?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just shut up and watch me,” was her breathless non-answer, head tilting back on a choked-back moan.</p><p> </p><p>Not an explicit yes, but it never had been. Jen squirmed on top of her hands and gritted her teeth, tried not to groan when April grabbed the back of her neck with her free hand and wrenched it backwards with a fistful of hair.</p><p> </p><p>“You love it,” April said, not a question.</p><p> </p><p>Jen did. God, she really, really, really fucking did.</p><p> </p><p>“Say it,” April commanded.</p><p> </p><p>“I love it,” Jen gasped out, unashamed. “God, fuck. I love it.” </p><p> </p><p>If this was punishment, Jen decided, she’d take it, watching heavy-lidded as April came nearly silently, mouth open, face contorted, breath stopped.</p><p> </p><p>The smell of sex was just starting to permeate the cramped space, and Jen moaned when April kissed her sloppily and wiped her fingers on Jen’s five-hundred-dollar suit skirt.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t have the will or the energy to be upset about it, but still managed an “Oh, come on.”</p><p> </p><p>“We both knew you were going to dry clean it, anyway,” April said. “Especially after this. Switch positions with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen did, grumbling, more out of breath than she’d care to admit to being when they finally successfully reversed their positions and she ended up hovering over April’s lap, the skirt having been hiked up her thighs in the process.</p><p> </p><p>“We can stop anytime you want to,” April teased, palming the now-bare skin of her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you fucking dare,” Jen said. “You got me here, now do something about it. You’re not driving me home until you get me off.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” April agreed, eyes dark, and without further warning, her hand crept up Jen’s inner thigh and stole into her underwear, immediately circling Jen’s clit in a way that had Jen grinding down against her fingers: not enough.</p><p> </p><p>“More,” she demanded, voice husky. “Inside.”</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, April slipped two fingers inside of her without comment and simply watched her face. Jen probably should have known better than to trust it, but, always greedy, she broke her gaze a moment later when she leaned back and started riding those too-accommodating fingers.</p><p> </p><p>A light slap across her cheek – Jen gasped reflexively; there it was – had the effect forcing Jen into both alertness and submission.</p><p> </p><p>“Again,” she requested, breathless, and April obliged, harder this time. Jen’s hips stuttered, and then picked up their pace. This wasn’t going to take long. One hand braced herself against the roof while the other snuck under her underwear to circle her own clit shamelessly. “God, <em>fuck</em>, you’re good at this.”</p><p> </p><p>“So surprised,” April said, eyes gleaming as the low garage lighting hit them just right. Just right. “So you’re gonna come for me soon, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Jen moaned. “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” April said softly, letting the palm of her spare hand rest against Jen’s cheek. It was a successful enough move that Jen never saw the next question coming.</p><p> </p><p>“How was Ben?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen froze – not because she was any less turned on, but because some alarm somewhere was blaring <em>Danger, Jen Barkley, danger! </em></p><p> </p><p>“So, this is a punishment,” she said, but the matter of fact tone she was aiming for was at least a little ruined by how wrecked her voice was.</p><p> </p><p>“No punishment,” April said, which was sure something to say when her fingers were squelching their torturously slow way through Jen’s cunt. The sudden gasp of breath Jen took might have sounded suspiciously like a squeak. “Just thinking about the dumb look on his face if he caught you getting fucked like this. In the front seat of a pre-owned Camry. And oh. By <em>me.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Several questions popped into Jen’s mind, chief among them <em>Do you want him to know? </em>and <em>Wait, is this doing something for you? </em>Still frozen with her own fingers on her clit and suspended over April’s lap, Jen considered her two options: to stop everything or to ramp it up.</p><p> </p><p>And, well. Jen was Jen.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that what you want, babe?” she asked as her fingers started moving again on her clit and her orgasm sluggishly resumed creeping up the backs of her legs. “How about we take it further, huh? You come with me next time, and show me off to everybody in Pawnee – “</p><p> </p><p>Answers, finally, hitting in the way April immediately started to fuck her harder, almost unconsciously. Jen almost laughed in triumph.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be just like this, hmm?” she said, letting her eyes slip shut to imagine it. “You can put me – oh god – right where you want me. Show ‘em all who you are now.” Ben, Leslie, April’s coterie of friends, hell, even her ex – let ‘em watch, let ‘em see. It wasn’t like Jen had never considered the fun she might have had with either of the Knope-Wyatts, she wouldn’t have been picky about it –</p><p> </p><p>“You’d like that, huh?” April said, voice rough. “You want me to show you off with my fingers up your cunt? Dripping all over my wrist?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Jen moaned.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” April echoed, and laughed again, darkly. “I’d say I should have known but I did, didn’t I? What else, hmm? How about… how about on my knees, eating you out. Your pretty thighs framing me in between them. Tongue-deep inside you. And nobody can unhear the fact that I’m licking every last drop you have to give me from right out of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Jen said as the image washed over her. “Oh, god, <em>fuck.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“So you want it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I want it!”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess you’re right then,” April drawled. “We’ll just have to make it happen, won’t we?”</p><p> </p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck. “Can you – " Jen said urgently. “Your fingers – "</p><p> </p><p>April understood what she wanted, somehow, and curled her fingers inside of her – <em>perfect; </em>she might have even said so out loud – and Jen split her fingers into a “v” and milked her clit with her own slick, once, twice, three times, there, there, <em>there – </em></p><p> </p><p>April caught her with her free hand when she came and collapsed forward. Jen gave her credit: her fingers were still fucking her even through the awkward angle. A little clumsy, but Jen’s own fingers on her clit weren’t exactly elegant either now that they were trapped between their bodies. It did the trick, though, and Jen groaned when it was over. Her knees were killing her.</p><p> </p><p>“Better?” April murmured with an openmouthed kiss against her neck.</p><p> </p><p>No. Yes? Jen honestly didn’t know.</p><p> </p><p>“Take me home?” Jen said after a moment instead of answering, exhausted.</p><p> </p><p>Another moment, another kiss, this one with a hint of a bite, and then April patted at her to move backwards so she could get out. Jen managed it with another groan, and then worked on rearranging herself vaguely into the shape of a human with shaking hands.</p><p> </p><p>The driver’s side door opened. April slid inside and started the car, jeans buttoned, perfectly composed. “Ready?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>Jen blew her hair out of her face and turned her head to look at her. She was back to being unable to read April’s expression with a hundred percent certainty, and maybe that much was just how very, truly fucking late it was. But there was something else there too that was slapping Jen across the face softly and saying, <em>Hey, hey! Pay attention! </em></p><p> </p><p>Jen let her head tip back against the headrest. Reached up to grab the seat belt, buckled herself in.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured, eyes closing. “Let’s go.”</p>
