<div class="userstuff">
<p>Sweat runs down the side of Rio’s face. She feels tired and alive at the same time, as the noise of the cheering crowd fades to the background.</p><p> </p><p>She looks at her pitcher, Agatha taps her foot impatiently waiting for Rio to throw the signal. Her purple softball pants clinging tightly against her thighs, the sleeves of her jersey rolled up to show off her toned arms.</p><p> </p><p>Rio forces her eyes to seek out Lilia instead, the head coach of the team who is currently nervously pacing in the dugout. Her assistant coach, Sharon, gives Rio an encouraging smile and a thumbs up. Lilia looks thoughtful for a second and then makes eye contact with Rio. She touches her hat and then her nose with a slight head nod, indicating permission for Rio to make the call. This is not something that happened often in her four years playing at Westview State University, but Rio always jumped at the opportunity.</p><p> </p><p>She takes a deep breath and looks at the girl in the batter’s box. Her feet are crowding the plate, like she is asking for Agatha to hit her. One sideways glance at Agatha tells Rio that the girl might just get her wish, her teammate and best friend looking murderous at the batter’s blatant stupidity.</p><p> </p><p>The count is 3-2, bases are loaded and there are two outs in the last inning of the game. They are up by one run, which means that their only option is an out right now. Agatha has an impressive arsenal of pitches Rio could choose from, but Rio already knew what she wanted to call before she even got permission. </p><p> </p><p>She grabs the chin of her catcher’s helmet and brings it back down, protecting her face from any missed balls. Her ungloved hand drops between her spread legs as she sits in her crouched position. She forms a peace sign with her fingers, repetitively curling the digits to symbolize Agatha’s rise ball. </p><p> </p><p>It is one of Agatha’s favorite pitches to throw, Rio still remembers the night she finally got it to hit a crisp 69 mph at the end of last season. When Agatha realizes the call, her face grows wicked, her mouth spreading wide in a way some people would call a smile, others might call a sneer. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha steps on the pitcher's mound, as she rotates the ball against her leg, a tradition she does before she throws every pitch. The ball gets brought to her glove, then she turns her body slightly as the motion starts. Before Rio knows it, the ball is hurtling towards her. Her glove is already there waiting, as the ball starts rising before going over the plate. Rio moves quickly, knowing she has to frame the pitch if this girl doesn’t swing. </p><p> </p><p>A woosh of air hits Rio’s face as the bat comes around, missing the ball completely. There is a thud as Rio catches the pitch in her mitt. The ump calls the strike and the third out, officially ending the game and giving the girls the win. </p><p> </p><p>On instinct, Rio whips her helmet and glove off, running towards Agatha, as the rest of the team storms the field. She scoops her best friend into a hug that lifts her feet off of the ground. Agatha immediately returns the sentiment, wrapping her arms around Rio’s neck, as they both break into big smiles. The rest of the team catches up to them, joining in on the celebration. </p><p> </p><p>No one thought they would ever make it this far, being one of the university’s first teams in over 25 years to make it to Regionals in Softball. Now they have just won their first playoff game, leaving them one win away from making Super Regionals, which would rank them at top 16 in the country.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally pulls back from Agatha, just enough that she can see the other girl’s face. Her cheeks are slightly sunburned from being outside everyday, her summer freckles already starting to dot around the center of her face. Her cheeks are flushed from the adrenaline of the moment, her pink lips curling into a radiant smile. She's got a little bit of dirt on her cheek from sliding into home plate last inning, and she looks absolutely <em> breathtaking</em>. </p><p> </p><p>For a split second, Rio has the urge to dip down and kiss her. She shakes her head and the thought is gone. Agatha is her best friend, who also happens to have a boyfriend. So instead, she pulls her in again, trying to convey her emotions through a loving hug. Rather than pulling away, Agatha’s arms tighten around Rio’s neck, keeping them close together. </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>The next day, the girls all meet in one of the conference rooms in the athletics building to go over film. Lilia and Sharon walk in together carrying three big boxes of celebratory pizza. They never have a physical practice the day after a game, instead the tradition of watching the recordings and discussing their strengths and mistakes takes precedence. Lilia always rattles on about how important reflection is to improvement, and <em> blah blah blah </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Rio has always found this part of sports boring, definitely preferring hands on learning. When she swings her bat or dives for a catch, it is all muscle memory, an instinct that is indescribable. Sitting around and talking about it actually makes it harder for her, sometimes getting in her head and messing with her reflexive reactions. Over the years, she has gotten better at blocking it out, but it is still a struggle sometimes.</p><p> </p><p>She sits in one of the chairs, facing the wall that the video will be projected onto. At least she will get some free pizza out of this. Agatha walks in a few minutes later, her long hair loose around her torso. She is wearing a skin tight pink crop top paired with tiny black athletic shorts, the toned muscle of her legs, arms, and stomach on full display. Rio finds herself looking away, something about the outfit making a squirming sensation arise in her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>“Saving this for someone, Captain?” Agatha giggles in her ear, as she plops down in the chair next to Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is finally able to turn her head back to the room, happy that most of Agatha’s body is covered by the table. </p><p> </p><p>“All yours, Captain.” Rio says back, clearing her throat. </p><p> </p><p>The nickname is an homage to the fact that they are co-captains of the team. Having been paired up as a pitcher-catcher duo freshman year, the two girls quickly became inseparable, it only made sense that they led the team together in their final year. </p><p> </p><p>“We had a great game yesterday, but that is not going to be enough to get us into the championships, ladies.” Lilia’s voice booms from the front of the room, as Sharon tries to get the projector to work.</p><p> </p><p>“We have a long road ahead of us, with many tough battles–” Rio’s brain hears before she completely tunes out. She feels Agatha’s foot playing with hers under the table, causing the rest of the room to fade away. Rio kicks her foot back at her best friend, earning her a soundless giggle.</p><p> </p><p>They continue on like that for a little while longer, Agatha seemingly attempting to bring Rio’s sweatpants past her calf with just her sock covered feet, while Rio attempts to fend her off. The game is a little thrilling, but the real distraction comes from doing anything with Agatha, the other girl easily commanding her full attention whenever she is around. Rio can’t help but be drawn to her, eyes following her around every room. </p><p> </p><p>“--anything to add, Captains?”, Lilia calls, making Rio immediately stiffen in her chair. Her palms start to sweat as everyone in the room turns to the two of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Think you covered everything, Coach.”, Agatha responds with a cheeky smile and a two-finger salute. Rio gulps and silently nods in agreement, curious how Agatha got so good at thinking under pressure like that. It is half impressive, half intimidating. </p><p> </p><p>With that, Lilia starts the recording of their game from yesterday. Silence falls over the room as the image fills the screen. </p><p> </p><p>It opens to an overhead view of the field from the perspective of home plate. The entire infield is at the pitcher’s mound, wishing each other good luck before the game starts. Rio watches herself offer her hand, Agatha immediately responding with her own. They do two quick sideways high-fives, ending the movement with a fist bump, the same handshake they have been doing since their first practice together. Rio never forgets it, knowing how rituals have always helped ease the other girl’s beginning of game jitters. </p><p> </p><p>Video Rio puts her helmet back on and walks to her spot behind home plate, Agatha watches her go with a soft smile, before she shakes out her limbs. Her face drops to one of steel as she attempts to get into the zone. The first batter walks up to the box, Agatha rotates the ball against her thigh, and the game begins.</p>

<p>
<b> <em>THWACK</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>The ball ricochets off of the far wall of the batting cage. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Another. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>THWACK</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swings her bat around again, sending a line drive up the middle of the narrow space.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Still not good enough. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>WOOSH</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>A ball whizzes by as a startled Agatha jumps out of the batter’s box, heart rabbiting in her chest at the unexpected intrusion.</p><p> </p><p>“... Agatha? Are you in here?” The familiar voice calls out again.</p><p> </p><p>Moments later Rio steps out from around the corner. She is dressed in a sleeveless muscle tee and loose gray sweatpants, her hair falling in messy waves around her tan shoulders. Agatha feels her mouth go dry, her tongue suddenly sitting heavy in the space behind her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>WOOSH</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jumps again as another ball flies over the strike zone. </p><p> </p><p>Right. </p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, I’m going to put a bell on you one of these days.”</p><p> </p><p>She jogs up to the machine at the far end of the cage, flicking the switch and powering it down. She begins picking up the balls that have scattered around the floor, loading them back in the basket, hoping to avoid the lecture she knows she is about to receive.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you think you’re doing?”</p><p> </p><p>No such luck.</p><p> </p><p>“Practicing. You should try it sometime, Captain.”, she aims to lighten the mood by teasing back but the air remains stubbornly thick. </p><p> </p><p>Rio starts picking the balls up too. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, you’re going to burn yourself out. We don’t practice after game days for a reason. You need to rest.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. It’s a sweet sentiment, but she is not really in the mood for sweetness right now.</p><p> </p><p>“I was just wrapping up anyway,” Agatha mutters as she bends down to pick up the last ball. As she reaches her hand out for it, pain shoots up her left arm. Instinctually, she winces, dropping the ball back on the floor with a thud. </p><p> </p><p>Fuck. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe Rio didn’t see that.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck was that?”</p><p> </p><p>0/2 today.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing to be worried about dear, I just twisted it wrong earlier.”</p><p> </p><p>A lie. </p><p> </p><p>Her pitching shoulder has been aching for two weeks now. Reporting it is not an option. By the time she would be cleared to play again, the season would be over, and she was <em> not </em> going to miss her final games over a tweaked muscle. She needed to soak in every last second before her lifelong sports career was officially over.</p><p> </p><p>“Bullshit. Talk to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha keeps her head down, avoiding the worried look that she knows she will find in her best friend’s eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly makes her way over to her, approaching like she is a wild animal. She comes to a silent stop a foot away, giving Agatha the chance to explain herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha remains silent, so Rio reaches out for her, gently placing her hand on Agatha’s chin in order to tilt it up. </p><p> </p><p>When their eyes finally meet, Agatha finds something soft and unexpected there, almost like understanding. </p><p> </p><p>“Turn around.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wordlessly obeys, knowing now is not the time to test Rio’s patience.</p><p> </p><p>Her best friend's hands steadily make their way up her back. She feels the hair spilling out of her long ponytail shift onto her right shoulder, leaving the hurt one accessible to Rio’s touch. Her eyes flutter shut on instinct, knowing what’s to come.</p><p> </p><p>Gently, Rio starts pressing her thumbs into the area, a move she has happily done for Agatha hundreds of times. She works over the hurt muscle, finally providing the relief only her hands can seem to bring. </p><p> </p><p>A soft moan slips out of Agatha’s throat before she can stop it. Rio pauses for a moment, then picks up like nothing happened. This is why they work so well together. Rio always knows when to push and when to back off. It’s like someone gave her a cheat sheet, her strong hands always know what Agatha’s body needs, she always says and does the right thing…</p><p> </p><p>A tight feeling starts up in her lower gut, a familiar ache she has pushed down in Rio’s presence many times. It’s like every nerve in her body becomes alive when the other girl is around, responsive and eager for her touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Listen,” Rio starts as her fingers continue to knead while moving up to her neck, “ I know you want to win, but pushing yourself like this is not going to get us there.”</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t tell anyone that I think you are hurt, if you promise to stop your secret late night practices. You need to at least try taking care of yourself.” </p><p> </p><p>Her hands finally still, a silent demand for Agatha to respond. </p><p> </p><p>“... I promise.” Agatha whispers, her throat starting to constrict. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha does not cry. She has not cried since she moved out of her mother’s house for college four years ago. Yet, standing here, being forced to suffer Rio’s delicate touch, and her unwarranted kindness, she feels tears start to well in her eyes. She has a sudden overwhelming need to collapse into Rio’s arms, a deep part of her aching to be held by the other girl.</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, before any of that can come to pass, a sound from the corner of the room draws both of their attention. Agatha’s eyes snap open and try to track the source. Her phone buzzes atop her softball bag, immediately interrupting the moment. Agatha silently thanks the universe as she is able to subtly wipe her tears while walking towards the device. </p><p> </p><p>Her thanks is immediately rescinded when she sees the name flashing across the phone. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ralph Fucking Bohner. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>With a roll of her eyes, she picks up the call, his voice immediately booming across the speakers. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Hey, babe. What are you doing right now?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha has to stifle a groan. </p><p> </p><p>The man in question is technically Agatha’s boyfriend but she can’t help but despise him. The son of one of her mother’s many friends, they were essentially set up as teenagers, Ralph following her to whatever college would give her a full ride. </p><p> </p><p>On the brightside, he was the only candidate her mom offered that agreed to wait until marriage. They mostly just make out, though Agatha does not really understand the appeal. His stubble irritates her face and his tongue reminds her of a dying fish, flopping around in her mouth. She has long decided that she must not be a very sexual person, more focused on her school work and sports performances than her peers who seem to be having sex constantly. It must be all of that Catholic shame her mom instilled in her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey. I’m at the cages right now, can I call you back later?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Totally understand babe! If you have free time, maybe you can come over tomorrow?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Maybe, but probably not. My schedule is super packed with playoffs right now so… I’ll keep in touch.” </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Okay, I love yo–”, </em>she pulls the phone away from her ear, hanging it up. Something about the way he gives her affection makes her skin crawl, a pit of despair settling somewhere deep in her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>She tosses her phone back down onto her bag and then turns around to see an empty space. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t even hear Rio slip out. </p><p> </p><p>The room suddenly feels bigger, emptier than it did before she got here. A tiny shiver runs up Agatha’s spine as she gathers her things, lest Rio come back and have an excuse to snitch her out to the athletic trainer. </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>When she makes it back to their team house, which is a full two minute walk from the gym, all of the lights are off. She heads inside, stopping by the kitchen to grab herself a water and bedtime snack. </p><p> </p><p>She spots her favorite heating pad sitting on top of the communal microwave, next to a handful of Reese's Cups, Agatha’s favorite candy. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>A small smile graces her face, warmth taking over her whole body. She would never admit it but she loves being taken care of like this. She loves the way Rio always thinks of her, and the way she touches her. She loves her company and her pretty smile. She is so lucky to have such an amazing best friend.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>A few days later, Agatha stares in between Rio’s legs, waiting for her to make the call. The sun is hot, this facemask is uncomfortable, and her arm is killing her. They need to end this game quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks back at her, taps the inside of her left thigh and then holds up three fingers. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Inside changeup. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Without needing to tell her body to move, she steps forward onto the pitcher’s mound. She presses the ball up against her outer thigh, spinning it in her hand until she finds the correct grip. She hits her signature hip twist and does her wind up, sending an off-speed pitch on the line of the batter's box.</p><p> </p><p>The girl on the opposing team swings, the ball making awkward contact with the handle of her bat, rolling pathetically up the field. Their shortstop, Natasha, easily scoops it up, flicking it over to their second baseman, Wanda, who taps the bag before firing it to first. A beautifully executed double play that ends the game in an instant.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Holy shit. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> They are going to Super Regionals. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>As this thought dawns on her, she feels the sudden weight of a geared body wrap around her from behind. Rio’s arms completely envelop her as the rest of the infield comes over giving each other hugs. They all know not to reach for Agatha, who is not much of a toucher. She hits her quota with Rio alone, her best friend always being overly physically affectionate. Though she finds that she doesn’t mind as much when it is coming from Rio. </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>On the way home from the game, Agatha and Rio sit together on the bus. One pair of wired headphones shared between them because Agatha forgot her air pods and Rio refuses to accept change, claiming her wired headphones still work perfectly fine. </p><p> </p><p>The physical connection between the two forces them both to lean into each other's space, listening to the “<em>After Dub Playlist” </em> they made together when they were freshmen. They have continued to add songs to it over the years, only listening to it together as they play Dominos on the drop down tray tables of the team bus on their way home. </p><p> </p><p>Towards the end of the ride, Jen, their first baseman and housemate, sends a message to their roommates group chat. </p><p> </p><p><b>Jen: </b>Party tomorrow night to celebrate the big win?</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha look at the text together on Rio’s phone. They look up at each other and summon matching devilish smiles. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> This was going to be fun. </em>

<p>Rio looks at herself in the mirror. Her cargo pants sit low on her hips, showing off the hem of her Calvin Klein briefs. Her short sleeve button up shirt is left open, nothing but a Nike sports bra and gold chains underneath. This outfit allows for her few arm tattoos to be put on full display. She puts a black snapback on and her golden ear jewelry, finalizing her look for the party. </p><p> </p><p>Her roommate, Alice, is nowhere close to being done, her side of the room looking like a tornado just blew through. </p><p> </p><p>“What about this top?” Alice questions, holding the black long sleeve up to her torso. </p><p> </p><p>Before Rio is given the chance to answer, there is a loud knock at their door. Rio already knows who it is, only one person in the house would ever have the audacity to make themselves known so brashly. Swinging the door open only confirms the theory, Agatha standing on the other side expectantly. </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a moment to look her best friend up and down. Agatha dons a short purple sundress, the hem of which lays on her upper thighs, giving a great view of the pitcher’s toned legs. Her shoulders and arms are also on full display, the muscles there subtle but impossible to ignore. </p><p> </p><p>Rio realizes her mouth is hanging slightly open, saliva pooling under her tongue. Agatha has always been beautiful, but after so many games and practices, sometimes Rio forgets just how good she can look all cleaned up. </p><p> </p><p>It is clear there was an attempt to straighten her long wavy hair, but her ends give her away, already beginning to curl in on themselves.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to come help me get ready?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, people don’t even say hi these days…”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh shut the fuck up and let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t help but smile, as she grabs her phone off of her bed and follows the other girl out.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess I’ll just choose my outfit by myself then,” Alice calls after them from the room, sarcastically.</p><p> </p><p>They head up the stairs together, making it up to the third floor of the team house. While most of the other girls on the team have a double or a triple, Agatha has been blessed with the only single bedroom on the property, a result of her mom paying extra for better accommodations.</p><p> </p><p>They make it into the other girl’s room, where it looks surprisingly clean given the state Rio normally sees it in, except for her vanity, which is covered in Agatha’s dumped out makeup bag. </p><p> </p><p>Without saying another word, Agatha grabs her liquid eyeliner, lays down on the bed, and closes her eyes. This is a familiar routine for them, Agatha always only trusting Rio to complete this step of the process. </p><p> </p><p>Before Rio realized that she enjoyed presenting more masculine, in high school she practiced with makeup for years, hoping it would help her get more in touch with her feminine side. It clearly did not work, so now she mostly uses the techniques she learned to contour her features in order to give herself more of an androgynous vibe. Well that, and to do Agatha’s makeup of course, not that she minds.</p><p> </p><p>Rio climbs on the bed, laying down on her stomach, and leans over Agatha’s still form, a routine so familiar now that it requires no preamble. She gently cups the soft skin of Agatha’s cheek in one hand, while the other gets to work, drawing sharp but tiny wings in the corners of her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>This close, Rio can see every line and freckle on the other girl’s face, her soft pink lips slightly parted and inches away from Rio’s own. At this realization, nervous butterflies fill Rio’s stomach. Despite the ridiculous amount of times they have done this, Rio still has not gotten used to being so close to the other girl’s face. It’s not her fault that she is a simp for pretty girls, Agatha objectively being one of the prettiest she has ever seen. </p><p> </p><p>Rio closes the eyeliner and pulls back to get a better view, making sure it all looks even. Agatha opens her eyes and Rio feels something in her chest melt a little. She really has never seen someone so effortlessly beautiful, the black makeup bringing out the deep blue of her best friend’s eyes. Agatha lifts her torso off of the bed and looks in the mirror across the room. </p><p> </p><p>“Perfect as always, Captain. Now let’s go downstairs and hide the good alcohol under the sink. I will<em> not </em> be stuck drinking Fireball again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio giggles at the memory, Agatha taking a few too many shots, and spending the evening pickpocketing people’s wallets, stealing only their punch cards for local restaurants. Rio had to set up in the other girl’s bed that night, making sure that she did not choke on her own vomit in her sleep. Thankfully, Agatha had a peaceful evening, sleeping so quietly that Rio kept checking her breathing just to be sure. Secretly, she enjoyed the fact that she smelled like Agatha’s room for two days afterwards, always finding her best friend’s signature scent of lavender and sandalwood extremely comforting. Plus they got three free bowls of frozen yogurt out of the ordeal.</p><p> </p><p>They head downstairs together, hiding one bottle of tequila to share between the two of them. Agatha looks up at Rio from her knees as she stuffs the bottle behind some cleaning products. Her blue eyes shine mischievously, her head perfect height with Rio’s waist, the angle allowing Rio a full view of Agatha’s cleavage as it sits pretty in her dress. Something about the sight makes Rio’s cheeks feel like they are burning, her stomach flipping uncontrollably as she averts her gaze away from her best friend’s body.</p><p> </p><p>She takes a sip of her drink, hoping the ice in her cup will help her cool down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio can already tell <em> this is going to be a long night. </em></p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>An hour and a half passes and the house is filled with people, music from the early 2000’s playing over the speakers. Agatha hasn’t left Rio’s side all night, matching her shot for shot as they dominate the beer pong table. </p><p> </p><p>Rio holds her ping pong ball out in front of her. Agatha automatically understands the silent request as she bends down and puts a tiny kiss for luck on the top of the ball, some of her lip gloss smudging against the white surface.</p><p> </p><p>With the blessing of a Goddess under her belt, Rio turns back towards the table where one lone cup remains. She takes a deep breath before taking her shot, the ball soaring in the air across the space and landing directly in the beer with a plop. </p><p> </p><p>The two guys on the other side of the table attempt their redemption shots, both missing horrendously. Agatha lets out her infamous witch cackle, mocking the men and sending them on their way. Rio has never found her best friend to be more endearing than in that moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Well I think someone has earned a reward,” Agatha states as she finally looks over at Rio, a wolfish smirk on her face. </p><p> </p><p>“Lead the way, Captain.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha starts heading towards the kitchen, subtly shoving bodies out of her way as she goes. She may look like a princess in that dress, but her baseline level of patience could rival someone who has recently been stuck in traffic for three hours. Combine that with her years of athletic training and a few mixed drinks, and the result is the forcible removal of anyone in their path.</p><p> </p><p>When they finally arrive, Agatha is already pouring the shots out. </p><p> </p><p>“Hold out your arm.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body obeys before her brain even processes the words, her palm facing up towards the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs Rio by the hand and brings her mouth down to Rio’s forearm, giving it a short but effective lick, before pouring salt on the line of saliva. The feeling of Agatha’s wet tongue on her skin sends goosebumps all over her body, her cells buzzing with a sudden adrenaline. She grabs her shot glass and one of the pre-cut lime slices, and reaching for Rio's arm.</p><p> </p><p>"Cheers to top 16." Agatha whispers above Rio's skin before finally making contact again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tries to keep her arm as still as possible as she watches Agatha’s mouth open, her tongue slowly crawling up the salt on Rio’s arm before she throws back her shot and bites into her lime. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is sure her face is fire hydrant red, unable to tamp down her body’s natural reactions after a few drinks. If her brain wasn’t already feeling floaty, she would probably take time to question why Agatha had used her arm instead of her own, not that she is complaining.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's face also looks a little red as she pours more salt on the same line of Rio’s skin, before handing Rio her two ounces of tequila. </p><p> </p><p>“Your turn.”, Agatha says as she shoots her a cheeky wink.</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels herself burn hotter at the idea of licking Agatha’s saliva off of her own skin, but follows the command anyway. She licks up the already wet line and tosses the liquid into the back of her mouth. Agatha holds Rio’s lime in between her thumb and index finger, essentially feeding it into Rio’s mouth straight from her hand. Rio happily bites into it, her face pinching immediately as the sour juice hits her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts at Rio’s dramatic reaction before leading the way towards the living room, officially abandoning their pong table. Here, a group of party goers seem to be playing a drinking game around the coffee table.</p><p> </p><p>Jen spots them and waves her hands in the air, beckoning them forward as two people walk away from the crowd. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey! We have two spots, do you guys want to join?”</p><p> </p><p>They glance at each other quickly and then nod in approval, grabbing beers from the cooler and filling the two empty spaces on the couch. Looking around, Rio sees Ralph and some of his friends on the opposite side of the coffee table. She instinctively rolls her eyes, never having been a huge fan of Agatha’s annoying, sexist boyfriend.</p><p> </p><p>Alice picks up a card and reads it out loud: </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Tell the group your craziest hookup story or finish your drink.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Alice’s face stays neutral despite the red tinting the tips of her ears. Silently, she picks her beer bottle up, quickly chugging the rest. </p><p> </p><p>The group jokingly boos her for taking the easy way out but moves onto the next person soon after. </p><p> </p><p>The girl on the side of Alice gets asked what her body count is, also choosing to finish her drink rather than answer. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is next up, her card daring her to ‘<em>choose a person in the group to</em> <em>switch an article of clothing with.’.</em></p><p> </p><p>Automatically, Rio’s head snaps to Agatha, not trusting anyone else in the group to give her things back to her in the same condition. Rio slips off her button-up shirt, handing it over to Agatha who puts it over her dress, leaving Rio in just her black sports bra and snapback. </p><p> </p><p>“I am wearing a dress, so my necklace will have to do,” Agatha says to the group as she removes her family locket, handing it to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I have been trying to steal this one for months. Good luck getting it back.”, Rio jokes while she clasps the chain around her neck, as if Agatha doesn’t know where she lives and won’t use any means necessary to subdue her and see its return.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes fondly while she grabs her card, reading it out loud. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Do you have any secret talents? Show us or take a shot.” </em></p><p> </p><p>A wicked grin breaks across Agatha’s face, while Rio immediately starts giggling, already knowing what the other girl is about to do. Everyone watches with bated breath as Agatha grabs hold of the thumb on her left hand, popping it out of place with a graphic snap.</p><p> </p><p>The whole crowd rears back in disgust, a chorus of horrified groans filling the room. </p><p> </p><p>“Tried to catch a softball without a glove on, in U12. Do not recommend.”, Agatha lectures to the crowd between giggles and snorts. Rio loves when her best friend laughs like that, making her constantly want to crack jokes just to try to amuse her.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually everyone moves on, the game continuing forward until it lands on Ralph. His shaggy blonde hair almost falling down into his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>He picks up his card and the smirk on his face drops in slow motion. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Show the last 15 pictures in your camera roll.” </em></p><p> </p><p>In an instant, one of his friends reaches for his phone, while the other holds his head still, trying to unlock the phone with his face ID. </p><p> </p><p>Rio cringes back in disgust watching the boys roughhouse. She does not understand how any girl could find this attractive. Risking a glance at Agatha, she sees a similar look of distaste cross her face. At least her friend’s not blind.</p><p> </p><p>The guy holding his phone howls in laughter as he brings up Ralph’s gallery, flipping the device around to show the crowd. Forget the past 15 photos, most of Ralph’s camera roll seems to consist of screenshots of girls in bikinis that he took from instagram baddie accounts. </p><p> </p><p>“I swear Agatha, it’s not what it looks like!” Ralph exclaims as his friends finally release him, tossing his phone back into his lap as they double over with laughter.</p><p> </p><p>The previous look of mild contempt that was on Agatha’s face has morphed into one of pure revulsion.</p><p> </p><p>“God, you are such a <em> pig </em>.” she spits as she stands up from the couch, her words laced with nothing but venom. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s not my fault you’re such a fucking prude.” he yells back while coming up to his feet, red in the face from embarrassment. “I’m a high value man, babe! A man who has needs! Not that you would know anything about that!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio immediately stands up, stepping in front of Agatha as if she could physically block his words with her body. Blood rushes in her ears as she feels her sympathetic nervous system activate, her instincts preparing her for a confrontation.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Don’t fucking talk to her like that. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>She feels her friend push past her, heading towards the stairs of the house.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gives Ralph one last look, her eyes narrowed in warning, before she turns to chase after her friend. Agatha needs her right now, she can beat the fucker up later.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t even need to check the other doors in the hallway, she already knows that Agatha is heading up to her room. </p><p> </p><p>Sure enough, when Rio arrives, Agatha’s door is closed, shadows moving in the light under the wood.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knocks. “Agatha… it’s me, open up.”</p><p> </p><p>There is a brief pause, roughly ten seconds where Rio worries that Agatha isn’t going to let her in. That fear quickly dissipates when the door swings inward, Agatha standing on the other side with a concerningly red face. Rio wants to pull her in and hug her tight to her chest, protect her and make sure nothing ever upsets her again.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s a fucking asshole.” she says instead.</p><p> </p><p>This earns Rio a huff and entry to the room, Agatha stepping back to allow her friend to fit through the space, shutting the door behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha then walks over to her bed, laying down face first in the sheets, an audible groan coming from the pile.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly approaches the structure, trying to think of something to say that will make Agatha feel better. </p><p> </p><p>“He doesn’t deserve you. You are way too hot for him, I have been trying to tell you to leave that rat for years”, Rio tells the truth while also trying to lighten the mood.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face raises off the bed slightly, a murmur coming from her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“... <em> He’s not wrong </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heart sinks in her chest. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> There is no way Agatha can actually think that, right? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Before she has the chance to ask Agatha to repeat her words, sure she must have heard incorrectly, Agatha rolls over onto her back, staring up at the ceiling. </p><p> </p><p>“Not about the high value man bullshit of course, he’s a moron there… I just… I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Maybe my mom was right, maybe I am broken.” Agatha sorrowfully whispers into the air, her voice subtly cracking. </p><p> </p><p>Rio feels speechless. Agatha, the funniest, most confident person she knows, has been reduced to a small and vulnerable version of her usually brazen self. </p><p> </p><p>Rio forces her jaw shut, realizing it has been hanging open since she was shocked silent. She closes the last two steps to the bed, falling backwards onto the soft sheets next to her best friend. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes shift to her now, the look on her face tells Rio that she is waiting for a response, desperate to be disagreed with.</p><p> </p><p>The hopelessness behind her expression makes Rio gulp. </p><p> </p><p>The truth it is then.</p><p> </p><p>“Honestly? I think you are the most perfect person I know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows rise slightly, most likely taken off guard, but still silent, giving Rio the space to continue. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what kind of person would say that to their daughter, Agatha, but she is wrong. Ralph’s wrong too. Truthfully, they should both fuck off. I have never met anyone like you before, and I will never meet anyone like you again. I’m certain of it. You are one of a kind in the truest way possible and I don’t know who I would be if I hadn’t met you four years ago. That is just not a life I would want to live.” Rio takes a deep breath pushing through her monologue. It actually feels pretty good to get these thoughts off of her chest. </p><p> </p><p>She turns her body to the side now, facing Agatha, and looking into her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“If you are broken for not wanting to sleep with that piece of shit, then consider me a fucking dumpster fire.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face looks red still but in a different way, her eyes shining as they stare back at Rio’s. A small smile tugs at her lips, clearly wanting to laugh at Rio’s joke but trying to stay upset a little longer.</p><p> </p><p>There is a soft pause between them.</p><p> </p><p>“What if I never feel that way for him?” she asks quietly, her eyes narrowing like she is disappointed in herself for speaking the fear out loud. </p><p> </p><p>“Then you should probably marry someone else after college, preferably someone who is not such a massive dick.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help but let out a tiny snort, her face inching closer to Rio’s as if her voice is the first one she has ever heard.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it’s the proximity or the alcohol or the last bits of her earlier adrenaline pumping through her blood. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t know why she says it but it tumbles out of her mouth all the same.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, don’t laugh! I am being serious, Agatha. Anyone would be lucky to have you as their girlfriend,” she brings her hand up to Agatha’s face, pushing a strand of long chestnut hair behind her ear. “... I mean… I would kill for a chance with a girl like you…”</p><p> </p><p>The second the words leave her lips, the world around them falls still. Agatha takes a sharp inhale, like someone has suddenly knocked the wind out of her. Her eyes dart back and forth between Rio’s own, probably trying to measure the amount of truth behind her words.</p><p> </p><p>The room is painfully silent, the only sound being Rio’s own heart beating rapidly in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh… In the sense that–” Rio tries to recover awkwardly but is unable to finish her thought as Agatha interrupts her with a swift motion, her face moving forward to meet Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>She presses their lips together softly, Agatha’s hand coming up to caress the skin under Rio’s jaw.</p><p> </p><p>She pulls back slowly, separating their mouths for a brief second. Agatha’s eyes are squeezed shut, like she is bracing for impact. </p><p> </p><p>Rio realizes she never even closed her eyes, that she is laying there stockstill while her beautiful, wonderful, gorgeous best friend is trying to kiss her. </p><p> </p><p>She springs into action, rectifying the situation immediately by fluttering her eyes closed and bringing both of her hands up to cradle the other girl’s face. The contact draws Agatha forward, their lips finally reconnecting. The pause really only lasted for two seconds, and yet she already felt like she could go crazy without this, the first drop of a new substance shooting into her veins.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha must have felt a similar draw, as Rio suddenly detects the other girl’s tongue placing kitten licks on her bottom lip, as her free hand runs itself all over Rio’s bare torso, her shirt still on the other girl’s back. Rio’s tongue happily peeks out to meet her in the middle. The kiss is somehow everything all at once; affectionate, desperate, shy but wet and full of heat. </p><p> </p><p>Rio feels like her body is on fire, a throbbing ache quickly making itself known in between her legs. Honestly, the catcher had never thought about what kissing Agatha might be like, preferring to shake the images from her head on the rare occasions that they surfaced. She certainly did not expect to feel so fully and completely devoured, Agatha’s tongue exploring her mouth like Rio might be hiding the meaning of life behind one of her teeth. </p><p> </p><p>During her normal hookups, Rio typically finds herself in the more dominating role, other girls assuming she prefers it because of her large arms and boyish aesthetic, not that she has ever complained. </p><p> </p><p>However, now Rio realizes she has never truly experienced the pure sexual bliss that she feels as Agatha’s hand drifts down from her jaw and wraps around her throat. She lightly flexes her fingers against the sides of Rio’s neck, not squeezing but rather expertly testing a hypothesis. This power move immediately draws a whimper out of Rio, her thighs squeezing together as a gush of wetness soaks her briefs. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Screw the scientific method. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>At the pitiful sound releasing from Rio’s throat, Agatha suddenly goes rigid, her entire body stilling against Rio’s in an instant. </p><p> </p><p>Their lips disconnect as Rio opens her eyes, taking in the look of pure shock she sees painting Agatha’s expression. Her best friend’s pupils are dilated, her breath coming in short pants as her chest heaves in her dress.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Fuck.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whispers in the air between their faces before she launches herself off of the bed, swiftly making her way to her bedroom door. As she grabs the knob, she stops for a moment, giving Rio a shred of hope that she will stay, or say something, or maybe even kiss her again. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, Agatha pulls the door open, stepping onto the landing outside of her room as the wood slams behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Fuuuuckkkkkkk.” </em>Rio reiterates Agatha’s previous sentiment, her hands coming up to cover her face.</p><p> </p><p>She takes a deep breath and feels like she is being slowly lowered back into her body, not even realizing how euphoric she felt during the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>She lays there for a few minutes more, surrounded by Agatha’s scent, trying to figure out what the fuck just happened. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> How did it take them four years to try that? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t think she will ever bother kissing anyone but Agatha again, realizing that she was getting close to finishing from the feeling of her best friend’s hands mapping her body alone. </p><p> </p><p>Even though it had only lasted for a few minutes, Rio feels confident that she has been ruined forever, she might have to chase this high for the rest of her life. Just the thought of this being a drunk one-off makes her stomach twist, the idea feeling almost too devastating to bear. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She needs to find Agatha. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio springs into action once more, scrambling off of the bed and to the door, already running possible places Agatha could be hiding through her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She flies down the stairs three at a time, almost taking a few students with her. Her body instinctively carries her to the kitchen. When she does not spot that familiar head of dark hair, she pushes further through the house, knocking on bathroom doors and looking into every bedroom. </p><p> </p><p>As she swings the door of the last bedroom on the first floor open, her mouth drops in shock, as she sees her roommate and their first baseman, Jennifer Kale, making out against the wall. The two girls break apart instantly at the noise, both feeling clearly embarrassed at being caught in such a precarious position. </p><p> </p><p>If this was any other moment, maybe Rio would have teased them or asked questions. She might have even offered words of support, happy to see Alice finally getting some. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, this was not any other moment.</p><p> </p><p><em> “Where’s Agatha?” </em>Rio tries to say with a relaxed tone, knowing that she probably looks like a half naked, sweaty lunatic.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I saw her go outside?” Alice offers cautiously, suspicious as to why Rio is not commenting on the precarious context of the moment but grateful all the same. </p><p> </p><p>Rio gives the two a quick nod, before she closes the door again and heads outside. </p><p> </p><p>She does not see Agatha amongst the crowd of the backyard, so she quickly makes her way to the side of the house, planning to head towards the front.</p><p> </p><p>As she turns the corner, she stops dead in her tracks. </p><p> </p><p>Her body runs cold as her heart sinks to her stomach, her eyes taking in the sight before her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha has Ralph pressed up against the side wall of the house, their lips making horrendous smacks as they meet over and over again. His hands are firmly planted on her ass, just below the hem of Rio’s button up that still sits on Agatha’s torso.</p><p> </p><p>Rio can do nothing but stare for a moment, her body trying to catch up to the emotional whiplash in her brain. </p><p> </p><p>Without a word, Rio turns around and heads towards the bushes in the far back. When she is out of view, she bends herself over heaving into the poor plants below.</p><p> </p><p>Tears stream down her face uncontrollably, the image she just saw seared into her brain, permanently stamped behind her eyelids. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> This really was a long fucking night. </em>

<em> “Fuck.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha throws herself off of the bed, tripping over her feet as she tries to escape. The moment her hand hits the cold metal of the doorknob, she feels herself pause. </p><p> </p><p>The urge to turn around and straddle Rio’s torso is so strong that Agatha has to grit her teeth to try and resist the call, every fiber of her being screaming to be back in Rio’s orbit. Her legs wobble slightly at the thought of what might happen if she goes back, of how much she wants Rio to touch her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s not sure why she did it. She's not even sure if she actually made a choice. It felt inevitable. <em> Unavoidable </em>. Rio standing up for her, caressing her face, her soft hands tucking her hair behind her ear… One moment she was looking into her best friend’s eyes, and the next she was tasting her tequila flavored spit, trying to swallow it down by the gallons, if God would only let her.  </p><p> </p><p>And that whimper? The sound that hummed against Agatha’s palm as she steadied herself on Rio’s throat? Agatha knew she had to pull away before she did something unforgivable, something she wouldn’t be able to take back. Something her mother would have her committed for. Another second on that bed and she might not have been able to ever stop wanting it, it might already be too late.</p><p> </p><p>She wants to look back at Rio but if she does, she knows she won’t be able to leave. She needs to do it now, stop this from happening while she still has enough fear coursing through her veins to push her forward.</p><p> </p><p>So she runs.</p><p> </p><p>The door flies open in front of her, then slams behind her as she makes her way down the stairs. She does not know where she is going but she knows she can’t stay here. She needs to put as much distance between Rio and herself as possible. </p><p> </p><p>When her feet land on the first floor, she is already making her way towards the kitchen. She grabs the bottle from under the sink, the bottle they put there together. Her heart clenches at the memory as she unscrews the cap, bringing the rim to her lips. She tilts her head back, swallowing a giant gulp of fire, the alcohol burning her throat and chest as it makes its way through her body.</p><p> </p><p>She feels relief for a moment, until she realizes that all she can taste is Rio. She remembers her tongue licking the same liquor off of the walls of her best friend’s mouth, sucking it out of her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>The sudden wave of guilt almost knocks her over, her stomach shifting uncomfortably. She takes another swig anyway, as she heads out the backdoor, needing fresh air. </p><p> </p><p>The second the wind blows over her heated skin, she takes her first full breath in ten minutes. Her eyes close, her head tilts back, allowing the present to wash over her in waves. Without opening her eyes, she takes another large pull from the bottle, gripping it by the neck, her fingers flexing against the glass. </p><p> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, her moment of peace is ruined by a man. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Of course. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Ralph.” Agatha responds without opening her eyes. She can’t even fucking look at him right now. </p><p> </p><p>“I was just about to go find you. I wanted to apologize for earlier. We both said things we didn’t mean and…”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> We?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“...I think we should put this all behind us.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ha. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She finally opens her eyes, taking in the man she was supposed to marry one day. His cheeks were red, either from his earlier embarrassment, or the insane amounts of alcohol he has probably already consumed tonight. </p><p> </p><p>Based off of the smell of his breath and the stains all over his shirt, she would assume the latter.</p><p> </p><p>Her body starts moving before she even realizes she wants to leave, her feet autopiloting in the opposite direction. </p><p> </p><p>He follows her of course, because a woman can never just walk away from a man. </p><p> </p><p>They make it to the side of the house before he grabs her by the arm.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you hear me? I apologized.”</p><p> </p><p>He forces her body to turn towards him, her back landing softly against the wall behind them, the bottle of tequila falling out of her hand and into the grass. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on, babe. Lighten up a little.”</p><p> </p><p>His hands cup her face as he presses a light kiss to her lips. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> It’s not her. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could cry. </p><p> </p><p>Kissing Ralph was never her preferred activity, but it was always more or less tolerable. At least he couldn’t talk to her while they kissed.</p><p> </p><p>Now? Knowing what Rio’s tongue felt like against hers?</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She was ruined. She flew too close to the sun and she got <em> fucking burned. </em></p><p> </p><p>He leans in for another kiss and her skin starts crawling, her throat starts constricting. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> This isn’t right. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She needs to make it right. She needs to fix it. </p><p> </p><p>Within the blink of an eye, their positions switched, Agatha pushing him against the wall. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fix it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She closes the distance between them, again and again. Their lips smack horrendously as she searches his mouth for what she found in Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It has to be here.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>No matter how many times she separates and reconnects their lips, there is something missing. </p><p> </p><p>It dawns on her that maybe something has always been missing. Maybe the only place she can find <em> it </em> is upstairs, currently laying in her bed.</p><p> </p><p>A single tear runs down her cheek, as she brings her hand up to Ralph’s throat, the same hand that had been pressed against Rio’s not five minutes ago. </p><p> </p><p>She squeezes her fingers against the flesh she finds, a last ditch effort, a shot in the dark. </p><p> </p><p>Ralph lets out a whimper and Agatha feels bile crawl out of her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>She pulls back with a gasp for breath, the walls of her throat impossibly tight now. </p><p> </p><p>“Does this mean you’re not mad at me anymore?”</p><p> </p><p>Ralph asks, dazed with his head leaning back against the wall. His pupils are slightly blown, reminding her of Rio’s. </p><p> </p><p>A terrifying thought crosses her mind.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What if everything always reminds her of Rio now? Will the other girl always be obnoxiously planted right behind her eyes?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>She supposes every sin has a penance.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha returned to her room, Rio was gone. </p><p> </p><p>Expected, and probably for the best, but she would be lying if she said the sight of the empty bed didn’t make her want to disappear through the floor. The room feels cold now, bigger and eerily quiet. </p><p> </p><p>Too tired to get ready for bed, Agatha decides to turn off the lights, taking off her shoes and slipping directly under her covers. She can still hear the music from the party shaking the house, some people clearly not ready to go home yet.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally closes her eyes, and takes a steadying breath in, she smells it. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio’s cologne. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Cedarwood surrounded by what smells like a field of flowers. The scent is so powerful that Agatha, in her sleepy haze, believes Rio might have returned. She shoots up in bed, only to realize that the room is still empty, she is still alone. </p><p> </p><p>She looks down at herself and sees Rio’s button up. In spite of everything, the shirt remains draped over her torso. She immediately brings the collar up to her nose, forcing the fragrance further into her sinuses. Maybe she can get it deep enough that she will never have to smell anything else ever again?</p><p> </p><p>She slowly slips the fabric down her arms, taking it off but holding it tight to her chest. She lays back down, curling her body around the piece of Rio, the cotton rubbing against the flesh of her cheek. </p><p> </p><p>With another deep breath of the fragrance, Agatha is able to close her eyes, finally entering a dreamless sleep.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>When she wakes up the next morning, the first thing she notices is the throbbing pain in her head, the sun coming through the curtains feels blinding. She brings her hands up to cover her face, hiding from the light for just a little longer. </p><p> </p><p>She makes her way to the bathroom, taking her reflection in. Her makeup is smudged all over her face, the delicate wings Rio drew transforming into streaks of black down her cheeks. Her skin looks paler than usual, her features puffy from the alcohol. She brushes her teeth, strips off her dress, and then hops in the shower, wishing to wash every part of the night previous down the drain.</p><p> </p><p>When she re-emerges from the steam, towel tied around her chest, her eyes fall to the bed. She spots Rio’s shirt spread out over her pillow, she must have fallen asleep cuddling it. </p><p> </p><p>At the thought of Rio, a pang shoots through her chest. </p><p> </p><p>What is the right thing to do here? Talk to Rio? Give her space? Try and explain why she is so fucked up?</p><p> </p><p>Maybe she is lucky, and Rio hasn’t even given it a second thought! Friends kiss at parties all the time, right? Maybe she is the only one freaking out about this…</p><p> </p><p>… </p><p> </p><p>Well… there is only one way to find out. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha quickly dresses herself, a tank top and a pair of loose sweatpants, her damp hair clinging to the soft skin of her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>When she opens her door she hears the sound of metal hitting against wood. She looks down and spots her family locket, the one she had given to Rio last night, hanging from her doorknob, a bottle of water sitting on the floor underneath it. She quickly grabs the chain and slips it over her head, the bottle of water coming up to her lips. </p><p> </p><p>Even after everything from last night, Rio is still trying to take care of her? </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help the squirming sensation in her tummy. There is something about Rio that makes her want to go soft. To be cuddled and tucked into bed at night, a kiss placed kindly on her forehead. Rio might be the only person who has ever seen her as something delicate, treated her like something fragile. She feels her heart glow in her chest, the radiant heat traveling through her arteries. </p><p> </p><p>She recaps the water bottle and heads down the stairs. She doesn’t care what they are anymore, she just wants to see Rio. They can talk about it or pretend it never happened, she will even accept a stern rejection. She just needs to be in the other girl’ presence right now, she just needs <em> her Rio. </em></p><p> </p><p>She makes it to Rio’s door, getting deja vu from the previous night. She knocks on the door and holds her breath, unsure what might meet her on the other side. </p><p> </p><p>She waits… and she waits… and–</p><p> </p><p>Nothing happens. </p><p> </p><p>She knocks on the door again, this time louder. </p><p> </p><p>Right before she starts trying to figure out how to pick locks, she finally hears noise. Feet hit the floor, sluggishly making their way to the door. The wood swings open and…</p><p> </p><p>Oh right. </p><p> </p><p>This isn’t just Rio’s room. </p><p> </p><p>Alice stands in the frame of the door, her eyes mostly closed, her hair sticking up in all directions. </p><p> </p><p>“A-Agatha..? What the fuck are you doing, man?” Alice brings her fist up to her face, sleepily rubbing her eyes, unknowingly further smearing her dark makeup. This move makes her look like an adorable baby raccoon, Agatha thinks. But she does not have the time to dwell.</p><p> </p><p>“Where’s Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>At the sound of Agatha’s voice, a lump on Alice’s bed begins to grumble and move. Alice’s eyes go wide at the realization and she quickly closes the door in Agatha’s face. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s not here!” Alice shouts through the door, clicking the lock back in place. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs out a frustrated breath. She looks at the clock on the wall and remembers that they have practice in two hours. She will just have to wait until then. She’s not famous for her patience but for Rio? She can figure it out.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally gets her answer when she pulls up to the field. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is already there, and already partnered with Cassandra Webb, also known as Cass, one of the team’s backup pitchers. They are warming up their arms, throwing the ball back and forth on the far side of the field. Agatha tries to wave to get Rio’s attention but it seems to be an impossible task, the other girl’s gaze effortlessly avoiding her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha ends up warming up with Carol Danvers instead, part time designated hitter, and the backup catcher that normally partners with Cass. Carol tries to make pleasant conversation but Agatha’s mind is elsewhere, focusing instead on not watching the way Rio is laughing at one of Cass’ jokes. It then becomes an active effort for Agatha to resist the desire to whip her softball in the direction of the pair. Who is that fucking happy at 10am anyway?</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the practice goes similarly, Rio following Cass around like a golden retriever, Agatha’s blood simmering increasingly hotter by the minute. She doesn’t know why the sight makes her feel like someone is plucking every individual eyebrow hair from her face, one by one, but it certainly does. That is <em> her </em> catcher, after all. Carol is great but she’s not Rio. She doesn’t… catch her pitches correctly? Yeah. That’s it. She twists her glove to the right the second the ball hits the netting of the mitt and it is messing Agatha up. Her gear is also a bit bigger than Rio’s, it looks ill-fitting. </p><p> </p><p>Pitching is a delicate art, and maybe if Carol stopped trying to talk to her so much, Agatha would be hitting her spots. </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>Four days later and the team is piling onto the bus. Four fucking days, and Rio still hasn’t talked to her, and not for a lack of effort on Agatha’s part. She has been going to Rio’s room three times a day, Alice claiming that she has always ‘just missed her’. </p><p> </p><p>Softball is no better. By the third practice after the party, Lilia forced them to pair up again, rightfully arguing that they ‘shouldn’t mess with the magic’. </p><p> </p><p>Rio has been impossible through it all. Only looking at Agatha to relay Lilia’s signs, somehow managing to avoid her eye. She hasn’t been able to get Rio alone for even a second, the girl surrounded by friends or their teammates constantly. This is hardly a conversation Agatha wants an audience for, so she waits. Rio knows she can’t run forever.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha makes it to the back of the bus, choosing the row she always shares with Rio. She sees her best friend enter the aisle, making her way past the rows. Agatha instinctually grabs her things off of Rio’s seat, making room for the other girl to sit down. Unsurprisingly, Rio stops two rows ahead of her, squeezing herself into the window seat. Cass follows close behind her, plopping down next to the catcher. </p><p> </p><p>A mix of rage and desperation fills Agatha’s chest, her eyes glued to the back of their heads for most of the three hour ride. At one point in the trip, Cass’s head falls over, landing on Rio’s shoulder. Agatha feels her jaw clench for the hundredth time this week, certain that her teeth have been grinded down to nothing by now.</p><p> </p><p>Why does Rio feel the need to rub this in her face? Why can’t they just talk about this like adults? If Rio doesn’t want her, that is fine. The least she could do is keep being her friend. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, she is doing whatever this shit is. </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>Coach Lilia announces the lineup, revealing that Agatha and Rio will remain the starting pitcher and catcher for this game. </p><p> </p><p>They silently head over to the field’s bullpen. Rio puts her gear on as Agatha stretches out her arms. They start with wrist flicks, slowly working their way backwards until they are almost at regulation distance. </p><p> </p><p>It is awkward and uncomfortable in a way things have never been between the two of them. They are finally out of ear shot of anyone else, the privacy Agatha has been trying to get for days. Now that she finally has it, she feels like she doesn’t even remember what she wanted to say.</p><p> </p><p>Could she realistically even leave Ralph? Her mother wouldn’t take that well. And for what? Rio clearly doesn’t want her. They are barely even friends right now, and wh–</p><p> </p><p>“OW, FUCK, AGATHA!?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is snapped from her thoughts in an instant, hearing her name fall from Rio’s lips for the first time in 87 hours, not that she’s been counting or anything. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is cradling her hand, catcher’s mitt in the dirt.</p><p> </p><p>“What is wrong with you!? You’re throwing so hard, my hand is going numb.”</p><p> </p><p>The first time Rio has directly addressed her since they <em> kissed </em> , and <em> that </em>is what she chooses to say?</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not my fault you’ve been catching for someone who can’t break 65.” Agatha shrugs, unable to help herself. “I didn’t think your hand could get that soft so quickly, but clearly I was wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m surprised you could read Cass’ speed past Carol’s twisting glove and clunky gear.” Rio spits back, as she slips her mitt back onto her hand.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha is not imagining things! But Rio can’t know that she’s right.</p><p> </p><p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about! I happen to like the way Carol’s glove moves,” Agatha huffs as she starts her windup again, “not that it’s any of your business!”</p><p> </p><p>The pitch lands in Rio’s glove with a smack so loud that even Agatha flinches. Maybe Rio should piss her off before every game, because she is throwing absolute heat right now. </p><p> </p><p>As Rio’s mouth opens, most likely a retort sitting at the tip of her tongue, Coach Sharon interrupts, coming over to the fence with a giant nervous smile. </p><p> </p><p>“Time to head on in girls, games about to start!” </p><p> </p><p>With one last glare shared between the two of them, the pair make their way to the dugout. </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t come to the pitcher’s mound after warm-ups, so no pre-game handshake but that’s fine. After their earlier conversation, the petty jab just throws fuel onto the fire.</p><p> </p><p>The first batter steps into the box. An idea pops into Agatha’s head, as a smirk slicker than oil crinkles her eyes. She steps up to the mound, ignoring Rio’s call. She lets the ball slip from her fingers a little too late, sending the ball flying high in the air. Rio jumps to try and catch it but comes nowhere close. Once Rio’s feet land back on the ground, she stands there for a moment, baffled by Agatha’s audacity to bring their shit onto national live tv. Agatha’s smirk only widens, as she takes the opportunity to mouth the word <em> “Fetch”, </em> accompanied with a smug shrug <em> . </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha can taste Rio’s eye roll from here, and it only fuels her more. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia calls her name and Agatha shrugs innocently, putting on her most dramatically shocked face, as if the ball really did slip. She receives another eye roll, making her 2/2 tonight!</p><p> </p><p>As the game progresses, Agatha is beating her personal records almost every other inning. In the fifth, she throws a pitch that reaches 74 mph, a speed she has never hit in her entire life. They are demolishing the other team. Agatha refuses to throw any of the pitches Rio calls, much to the catcher’s chagrin. Luckily she is playing with so much fire that it’s hard for anyone to notice she’s not following the calls. Before they head back onto the field for the sixth inning, Lilia pulls her aside. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m taking you out.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What the fuck? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not hitting your spots, Agatha. Is this on purpose? Are you hurting?”</p><p> </p><p>At the insinuation, Agatha freezes. The rage that is currently pumping pure adrenaline through her body has temporarily muted the strain that’s been haunting her muscle, but she knows that she will be in agony trying to sleep later.</p><p> </p><p>“What? No, I'm not hurting. Maybe Rio’s not calling the pitches right.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia gives her a look. Agatha silently concedes. They both know Rio would never do that, no matter how mad she is at a certain pitcher.</p><p> </p><p>“Sit down, kid, you’re done for tonight. Cass, you’re up.”</p><p> </p><p>Coach always keeps at least one backup pitcher ready on the bench, unfortunately today’s pick just happened to be the most annoying option. Cass squeals as she grabs her glove, and heads out to the field. Agatha scoffs as she puts hers away. It just had to be her…</p><p> </p><p>At the end of the game, after only letting up one run, the umps make the final call. Tragically, the last out happened to be a strike Cass threw. As the batter steps out of the box, Cass takes off, running and jumping into Rio’s arms. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha considers the consequences of a murder charge. </p><p> </p><p>‘<b> <em>Star Westfield State University Softball Player Found Guilty of Murder, Caught with Fellow Pitcher’s head–’</em> </b></p><p> </p><p>Yeah, probably not a good look.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>After the game, the team heads to the hotel restaurant for dinner, the space looking like a college bar. Rio purposefully sits as far away from her as possible, Cass to her right of course. Agatha barely has an appetite as she is forced to watch the two giggle and flirt all night. Rio’s arm rests on the back of Cass’ chair, as she hand feeds Rio fries from her plate, making Agatha’s stomach twist violently. Agatha and Rio don’t<em> normally </em> feed each other, but suddenly it’s all she can think about. She imagines Rio leaning into her, her eyes wide and compliant, Agatha’s fingers brushing her soft lips–</p><p> </p><p>“Great game today, sweetheart! 74 mph? Someone’s been practicing!”</p><p> </p><p>The gratingly positive voice interrupts Agatha’s totally innocent thoughts about her best friend’s mouth. </p><p> </p><p>She pulls her eyes away from the two players at the end of the table, turning to look at Coach Sharon with the sweetest fake smile she can muster.</p><p> </p><p>“Gee, thanks Coach. Anything for the team!”</p><p> </p><p>Whether Sharon realizes the sarcasm in her voice or not is irrelevant, as Agatha’s gaze gravitates back to Rio. </p><p> </p><p>…or it would if Rio was where Agatha’s eyes had left her, the two previously occupied chairs sitting empty at the end of the table. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart immediately stops beating, bringing her to her feet in an instant. She surveys the establishment, quickly scanning for any signs of her best friend. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, Agatha finds her, gathering arrows near the pub's dart board. She starts tossing them as Cass looks on in awe, clapping her hands whenever Rio makes one. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slowly lowers herself back into her seat, continuing to watch the players banter. Rio is smiling her<em> stupid </em> warm smile with her <em> stupid </em> tiny tooth gap on full display. Agatha starts to wonder how much force she would need to put her fist through the wall. </p><p> </p><p>Cass misses all of her shots and then turns to Rio with a pout, clearly trying to look pathetic enough to pity. Rio gives in, standing behind Cass and guiding her arms through the throws. </p><p> </p><p>Someone should probably take all of the knives off of the table. Agatha has never felt so possessive of anyone in her life. This is supposed to be her time with Rio, they got to the playoffs together, and now they can’t even enjoy it because of a drunken kiss and Rio’s inability to communicate with her like an adult? Sure, Agatha ran away first but she was ready to talk about it the next day. </p><p> </p><p>It hurts to think that Rio’s anger is outweighing their history right now, taking away from something they have only dreamed about since their first season together. </p><p> </p><p>Unable to watch this scene for a moment longer, Agatha turns to Coach Lilia.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we have our room keys now? I want to go to bed.”</p><p> </p><p>Coach Lilia checks her watch and agrees that it is time for everyone to head to their rooms. They pay the bill and everyone heads outside to grab their bags from the bus. Once they are all standing in the lobby again, Coach Sharon reads the room assignments out loud off of a scrap piece of paper, “...Natasha and Wanda in room 216, and, finally, Agatha and Rio in room 220.”, she says as she hands out everyone’s room keys.</p><p> </p><p>“Coach, can I switch my room assignment?” Rio blurts out before the key has even dropped into Agatha’s hand. Both the pitcher and the coach turn back to look at Rio with horrified expressions. They always share a room for away games. <em> Always. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Oh I get it now! You two are fighting! I hope this isn’t over some boy…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio both go red at Lilia’s confident cluelessness. The coach misinterprets their silence as confirmation of her theory.</p><p> </p><p>“I would hate to see a man come between the two of you, when you are normally so close,” Lilia continues, solemnly shaking her head, because God knows no mercy. “You two are sharing this room and I better see smiling faces in the morning. I don’t need the details, but I do know we need the two of you working together if we have any shot at winning the title. I don’t care what you do but you need to figure it out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha puffs out her chest as she takes the key from Lilia’s fingers. She then grabs her bags and starts heading to their room, Rio rolls her eyes but follows closely behind. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘Smiling faces in the morning’. Yeah, good luck with that. </em>

<p>When they arrive at their room, Agatha unlocks the door letting herself into the space. Despite Rio being five feet behind her, Agatha does not hold the door open, instead choosing to let it slam shut directly in Rio’s face. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> This fucking woman.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forward, resting her forehead against the cool wood of the entryway. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha. Open the door.”</p><p> </p><p>No response.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lets out a deep sigh. Staying away from Agatha has been brutal these past few days, definitely the longest they have gone without talking since they met. The loss is palpable, as if a part of who Rio is can only surface when her best friend is around. Even just trying to play softball together, something that has always come naturally to the pair, has become a grueling process.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reminds herself that she is only doing what is best for the both of them. If they don’t talk about it, Agatha can’t directly reject her, even though she kind of already did. Rio is not sure she would survive if she heard it right now though, and if she dies then she can’t catch for Agatha when they make it to the championships. She just needs time for the wound to close up a bit, everything still feels too fresh, and it’s hard to be around the other girl without wanting to kiss her or cry.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, <em> please </em> let me in.”</p><p> </p><p>The door swings inward, Agatha standing on the other side, a perfect mirror of the moment right before <em> it </em> happened. Rio shudders, a chill running up her spine at the sight of the familiar silhouette, except this time Agatha’s hair is in two french braids, her dirty green softball pants clinging to her thighs. Rio always did like the way Agatha looked in their ‘away’ uniforms, the colors bringing out the emerald hues in her mostly blue eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh so now you want to share a room with me? Make up your mind, Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, trying not to smile at Agatha’s antics. She is always so smart and funny, Rio can’t help but be entertained by her.</p><p> </p><p>She follows Agatha down the short hallway, passing a bathroom, landing in an open space with two full size beds. </p><p> </p><p>At least they don’t have to share, Rio thinks, <em> that would have been a nightmare. </em></p><p> </p><p>Before Rio can even put her stuff down, Agatha grabs a smaller bag, and heads to the bathroom. Three minutes later, Rio hears the shower turn on. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, the sound triggers a series of unwarranted NSFW images to flash behind her eyelids. Which is another new development Rio has been grappling with, unable to look at Agatha without imagining what would have happened if she had never broke them apart that night, and other similar story lines.</p><p> </p><p>Right now, her traitorous brain has chosen to embrace the context, images of a wet and naked Agatha blissed out under the stream of hot water, finally cleaning up after a long day. The mud, sweat, and dust from the field running down her curves with the droplets of water, her eyebrows furrowed in pure ecstasy at the feeling. Her fingers running through her soft long hair. Her hands lathering soap along her thighs and calves, over the bruises she has amassed from recent practices and games. Saliva starts pooling in Rio’s mouth as the vision starts to change, she sees herself joining her best friend in the small space, pressing her palms flush against Agatha’s wet body. Agatha’s back hits the tile of the shower, Rio lightly pushing her against the surface. Rio feels her underwear start to cling uncomfortably as dream Rio’s hands make their way down the other girl’s sternum, following a happy trail to—</p><p> </p><p>Her thoughts are interrupted when she hears the shower turn off. She bolts upright off of the bed and looks over at the clock. She has been daydreaming about Agatha’s slippery, flushed– <b>Agatha’s body</b>, for twenty minutes. </p><p> </p><p>This is why she has been avoiding the other girl. She can’t focus on anything that is not Agatha, the kiss fully awakened a dormant part of Rio’s mind, a part that can’t help but think of Agatha every moment of the day. It’s not always sexual either, sometimes she just imagines what it would be like to take care of the other girl, to hold her and cook for her, and lov–</p><p> </p><p>The door opens, steam pouring out of the frame. Agatha’s already dressed in her pajamas, a camisole paired with short cotton bottoms, her wet hair making the thin top almost see-through in certain areas. The second Rio’s eyes fall on the sight, she feels like a character in a cartoon, her eyes bulging out of her head as her pupils shape themselves into hearts. She quickly averts her gaze, not wanting to make her best friend feel gawked at. She wordlessly grabs her things and holds her breath as she passes by Agatha to get to the bathroom, not wanting to accidentally inhale the other girl’s scent. After she finally closes the door, separating them for the time being, she strips off her own softball uniform and tucking her drenched boxers into the pant leg, not wanting to take a risk of them falling out in front of Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>— </p><p> </p><p>When Rio exits the bathroom fifteen minutes later, finally feeling refreshed and clean, the main lights are already turned off, Agatha tucked into her bed, laying on her side facing away from Rio and the room. </p><p> </p><p>Rio assumes that this means she probably doesn’t want to talk, as she puts her dirty clothes into a bag and silently climbs into her own bed. Memories float to the surface of Rio’s mind as she stares at the ceiling. She thinks of nights like this, the countless times the two of them shared a hotel room in a far away city, away for a tournament or best of three series. They would climb into one of the two beds, stay up way too late and watch ‘reality’ ghost hunting shows.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes the episodes would be a bit intense and Agatha would let Rio stay in her bed for the rest of the night, both a little scared but too proud to admit it. Rio would always wake up first, being the early riser between the two of them, and have to begrudgingly extract herself from Agatha’s grip, before the other girl saw. It was almost always Agatha gravitating towards Rio in their sleep, but she didn’t want the pitcher to feel uncomfortable or embarrassed by her unconscious self’s desire to cuddle. </p><p> </p><p>Rio longs for one of those nights now, missing her best friend painfully when they are forced to occupy the same space, feeling her absence more than ever in the quiet of the room. Instead, she tries to close her eyes, to get to tomorrow as soon as possible so they can go back to avoiding each other. </p><p> </p><p>“So who was it?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hears from the other side of the room, muffled and soft, but definitely there.</p><p> </p><p>“Who was what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs and twists onto her back.</p><p> </p><p>“You asked Coach if you could switch your room assignment. Who do you want to room with? Is it Cass?”</p><p> </p><p>This feels like a trap… is there a right answer to this question?</p><p> </p><p>“... uh, I don’t know. Anyone but you I guess?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Fuck. Well that certainly wasn’t it.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I just didn’t think it was a good idea for us to share today.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifts her upper body off of the bed, leaning on her elbow to get a better look at Rio in the darkness. Rio does the same, mimicking Agatha’s movements. </p><p> </p><p>“Why not?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What is with these fucking questions? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I thought you made yourself clear the night of… uh the party. After what happened, I thought it would be good if we both had some space.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio answers as honestly as she can without drawing unnecessary attention to the open wound that is still festering deep in her heart. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t think we’ve had enough? You've barely even looked at me all week.”</p><p> </p><p>“... <em>Do you want me to look at you, Agatha</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>The room falls silent, making Rio worry she said the wrong thing again. </p><p> </p><p>She hears a shuffle in the darkness, and then the sound of soft feet pittering across the carpet of their room. There is a gentle dip in the bed accompanied by the most comforting scent in the world. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She has not been this close to the other girl in what now feels like years (it’s been days), and her signature scent smells ten times stronger than it usually does, her hair still drying from the shower. Her head feels suddenly dizzy with the proximity, even though she can barely make out any of Agatha’s features in the black of the room. They sit there upright for another moment, silently taking in each other's silhouettes.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> ... I miss you so much, Rio. </em>” She hears Agatha respond with a whisper instead of answering the question. The way she says it feels like a confession. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> I’ve missed you too.” </em> Rio whispers back, because what else is there to say?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lowers herself until she is laying down in Rio’s bed, making the catcher feel like there is a rabid animal running around inside of her body. She feels her pulse rabbiting at the back of her throat but she lays down anyway, matching their positions on Agatha’s bed from the night of the party. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> This cannot be a good idea. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry if I made things uncomfortable that night.”</p><p> </p><p>“No problem,” Rio croacks out, all sense immediately leaving her body, “...I wasn’t uncomfortable.”</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Can we go back to being friends now? </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice is so soft, Rio just wants to scoop her up in her arms, plant kisses all over her face.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Y-Yeah, of course.”  </em></p><p> </p><p>There’s a moment of silence between the two girls, making it feel like the room itself is finally exhaling after holding its breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Well thank God for that. I don’t think I could handle another day of watching Cass trip over herself for your attention.” Agatha tentatively teases, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! She is a nice girl! You’re just jealous because I made another friend!” Rio shoots back with a giggle, feeling herself easily fall back into their old dynamics. Every cell in her body feels like they are gravitating towards Agatha, like a magnet being pulled toward its opposite pole.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts before exclaiming, “Something tells me she doesn’t want to be your friend, Captain. You should start carrying around a bucket to help with all the drooling, the poor thing has been leaving a snail trail of the stuff everywhere she goes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I like the girls with excessive saliva,” Rio says, raising her eyebrows suggestively, “not that it’s any of your concern.”</p><p> </p><p>There's another pause, this one feeling a lot less comfortable. Rio feels her stomach twist with regret at the slip up. </p><p> </p><p>Is it even a slip up? They did just agree to going ‘<em> back to being friends </em>’...</p><p> </p><p>So why does it feel like she just said the wrong thing? </p><p> </p><p>Rio really wishes she could see Agatha’s face better, resisting the urge to squirm as the silence continues to stretch. </p><p> </p><p>Rio hears the blankets move, Agatha seemingly shifting out of her spot. Before she can get up, Rio hears a soft hiss come from the other side of the bed.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha is in pain. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio suddenly remembers the game they played today, how hard Agatha was throwing the ball despite her sore muscles. Just as her friend’s feet hit the floor, Rio reaches out, ghosting her fingers over the fabric of Agatha’s top.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Your shoulder again? … Come here, let me take care of you.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shadowy form falls completely still for a second, like she is fighting a different battle inside of her head.</p><p> </p><p>Wordlessly, Agatha lays back down, this time flat on her stomach. Rio climbs on top of her best friend, straddling her thighs. </p><p> </p><p>She runs her hands through the bottom of Agatha’s hair, the strands feeling like velvet in between her fingers. Agatha’s muscles begin to relax, signaling to Rio that she is feeling comfortable enough to continue.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes the rest of Agatha’s hair to her opposite shoulder, like she has done so many times before. She runs the tips of her fingers up Agatha’s spine, feeling the heat of the other girl’s skin through the thin camisole. When her fingers finally move past the material, her breath hitches. Agatha’s body has never felt so warm and welcoming. It reminds Rio of the feeling she gets when she climbs back into bed early in the morning, when she knows that she still has a few more hours of sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moves her hands up, feeling the muscles of Agatha’s back in all of their glory. The girl really is ripped. She takes hold of the top’s thin straps and pushes them down Agatha’s arms, leaving the majority of her back accessible to Rio’s touch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally pushes her fingers into the impossibly tight flesh, earning a tiny, muffled whimper from Agatha’s throat. The sound lights something up in the primitive part of Rio’s brain, calling her to push deeper, to coax more noises out of the other girl.</p><p> </p><p>With this goal in mind, Rio puts extra force behind the flexing of her fingers, pretending like she is kneading dough. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, she stumbles upon the probable source of the pain, a big knot right on top of Agatha’s shoulder blade. She digs into the spot as gently as she can, trying to coax the muscle into a state of ease. The action causes a choked moan to spill from Agatha’s lips. Rio can feel the other girl squirming underneath her, Agatha’s hips rocking forward into the bed. </p><p> </p><p>The noises and the movements quickly begin to have an affect on Rio’s sanity, as she starts to feel that familiar heat bloom in her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>Rio presses down even harder, causing Agatha’s back to arche sharply, chasing the feeling of the catcher’s calloused hands. Simultaneously, she lets out an almost sinful groan, an audible mix of the pain and pleasure she is receiving. The garbled sound causes Rio to pause. </p><p> </p><p>“Shit, I’m sorry, do you need me to stop?” </p><p> </p><p>“<em>God, Rio, p-please don’t stop.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio feels a sudden gush of wetness leave her entrance, probably ruining her second pair of boxers for the day. She feels grateful for the darkness, knowing that it is probably helping her hide the dark red blush that has most likely spread across her cheeks at her best friend’s words. She has no choice but to pick up where she left off. </p><p> </p><p>The sounds and fidgeting continue, as she resists the urge to rut into the back of Agatha’s plush thighs. The other girl is no help, her hips chasing some type of friction against the mattress. The movement jostles Rio, making her feel like she is riding a really soft mechanical bull. </p><p> </p><p>At the thought of <em> riding Agatha</em>, Rio pauses again, her fingers stilling against the other girl’s muscles. Agatha releases a drawn out whine of protest at the loss of contact, before her hips still as well, seemingly also coming back to her senses.</p><p> </p><p>It is quiet while Rio assesses the path they are heading down, she fears she has never been so turned on in her life, her core feeling achingly empty, the tops of her inner thighs slightly sticking together.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice breaks over the syllables, her throat suddenly tight and dry despite the salivation in her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>The other girl remains quiet, ignoring the prompt. The only sound filling the room is the combination of the player’s panting breaths. Rio feels like she just ran a marathon. Her head is dizzy and the heat radiating off of Agatha’s body is making the feeling worse, the room slightly spinning around them. </p><p> </p><p>“Agath—“</p><p> </p><p>Rio tries again before she is cut off. Agatha pushes herself off of the bed, sending Rio flying to the other side of the mattress. Rio lands on her back with an audible ‘<em>oomf’ </em>, but she doesn’t have much time to think about it. Within a second, Agatha has moved on top of her, straddling her waist. </p><p> </p><p>They look at each other for a suspended moment, their eyes barely adjusted to the light. The straps of her best friend’s top are still resting halfway down her arms, her breasts threatening to spill out. Agatha leans down slowly, allowing Rio the opportunity to move away.</p><p> </p><p> <em>Fucking finally. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio surges up meeting Agatha in the middle, unable to wait any longer. The moment their lips slot together, a moan slips out of the depths of Rio’s chest, taking them both by surprise. Unlike last time however, the sound only seems to encourage Agatha’s assault, her tongue immediately taking advantage of Rio’s open mouth, sliding itself into the wet heat that was abruptly taken from it 4 days prior. </p><p> </p><p>The kiss grows desperate quickly, both girls acting like they haven’t had a sip of water in weeks, like the only thing that could possibly sustain them has finally landed back in their laps. Agatha’s lips are soft and wet, and exactly the way Rio remembers them. At some point, she recalls that she is a part of an entire body, her hands landing on Agatha’s bare thighs, encouraging her to grind down against the plane of her abs.</p><p> </p><p>The material of Agatha’s shorts are so thin, Rio can feel the other girl’s heat laying flat against her stomach. If she were able to focus for long enough, she is certain she would be able to feel Agatha's pulse against her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tentatively grinds down into Rio’s lap, releasing a toe curling moan into Rio’s mouth that the catcher eagerly swallows up, her grip tightening on Agatha’s soft flesh.</p><p> </p><p>Rio quickly accepts the fact that her entire athletic career has led to this moment, all of those summers dedicated to travel softball teams allowed her to be scouted by a college recruiter. The countless hours of catching lessons gave her the chance to be paired with her best friend. All of those team lifts and extra training sessions granted her the opportunity to develop abs for Agatha to grind on. </p><p> </p><p><em> The universe works in mysterious ways</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t think she could ever get enough of this. She doesn’t know how she came to terms with the idea that she would never get to feel this again. She can’t comprehend how she even made it a few hours without having Agatha this way, forget the days that it has actually been. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips pick up a pace, slowly soaking through the material of her shorts as their mouths move in perfect sync. Rio is unable to hide the groan that rips itself out of her chest at the feeling, her senses being overwhelmed by <em> Agatha</em>. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She needs to touch her. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio breaks the kiss first, Agatha chasing her lips with a whimper. </p><p> </p><p>Before she is able to reconnect them, Rio barely gets out,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Can I touch you?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s pursuits halt, her face pulling back slightly as she considers Rio’s question. </p><p> </p><p>Rio holds her breath, rubbing the pads of her fingers up and down Agatha’s thighs while she waits for an answer. </p><p> </p><p>Instead of responding with words, Agatha falls to the side, off of Rio’s lap, landing on her back. </p><p> </p><p>Her arms shoot up, hands flexing in the air. Rio takes this as her sign, working her way on top of the other girl's body. She slots her leg between Agatha’s thighs, feeling her immediately wiggling against it, searching out more friction. Their lips reattach, slower this time, with intention. Agatha’s hands work their way into Rio’s hair, pulling and pushing the other girl like the moon controlling the tides. Rio tenses her thigh, drawing a throaty moan out of Agatha, who’s pace begins to pick up again. </p><p> </p><p>Before long, Agatha’s slick is fully covering Rio’s bare thigh, the crotch of her cotton shorts clinging to her skin. Their lips disconnect once more as Agatha lets out a whiny plea,</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I can’t take it anymore, Rio, please. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>“Please what?” Rio replies, not trying to tease but because she genuinely wants to know. While she is not exactly privy to the intimate details of the other girl's sexual history, she does know that she has never done anything with Ralph, and she has certainly never done anything with another girl. She doesn’t want to move too quickly or push Agatha’s boundaries, she just wants to make her feel good. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> F-Fuck… you… sadist.” </em> Agatha barely gets out, her hips still working against Rio’s <em> .  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio brings her right hand down Agatha’s body, getting a firm grip against the other girl's hip, stopping her motions, eliciting a grunt of disapproval from her best friend. </p><p> </p><p>She rolls herself over and turns on the lamp that sits on their shared nightstand, the dim yellow light instantly filling the space. </p><p> </p><p>Rio then turns back to Agatha, who’s still wet hair has matted against the sides of her face, her once blue eyes have turned glassy, completely swallowed by the black of her pupils, and her cheeks and chest are flushed red from exertion and frustration. Her mouth is swollen and kiss bitten, quick breaths falling from her rosy lips. The thin straps of her top are almost at her elbows, the hard pebbles of her nipples poking through her shirt. Rio’s eyes continue further down, her breath hitching at the sight of the other girl's pajama shorts. A big wet spot in the center of the fabric’s crotch immediately draws her eye. She looks like every wet dream Rio has had since she was fifteen.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Jesus fucking Christ.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The air around them is beginning to smell of arousal and sweat, all of her senses being easily taken over by the trembling girl in front of her. Once Agatha realizes what Rio is looking at, her thighs slam shut and her hands move to cover the spot her slick is soaking through, the substance coating her upper thighs. Her cheeks turn a deeper shade of red and her eyes look to the ceiling to avoid Rio’s gaze, as if she has something to be embarrassed about, as if the sight of her alone is not giving Rio thoughts that would send her straight to hell.</p><p> </p><p>Unable to form actual words, Rio slowly reaches out to grab hold of one of Agatha’s wrists, moving it away from her wet core. Rio leans in slightly, catching the musky scent of Agatha’s arousal. Her mouth automatically starts salivating, her eyes subtly rolling into the back of her head as she fights off a pathetic whine. She has never wanted to taste someone as bad as she wants to taste Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, <em> please </em>tell me what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio manages to get out, sounding desperate and wrecked, begging her best friend to allow her the chance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally brings her eyes back down to Rio’s face, looking directly at her for the first time since the light turned on. She wrings her hands out in her lap, as if she is gathering all of the courage in her body.</p><p> </p><p>“... <em> would you be okay using your mouth? </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio has to use every ounce of her willpower to not jump for joy in that moment. She is pretty sure she has never heard a more beautiful sentence in her life. </p><p> </p><p>She silently nods her head, scared that if she opens her mouth the only thing that will come out is a mortifying whine<em>,</em> like a puppy who heard her owner say the word <em> ‘treat’. </em></p><p> </p><p>She scoots herself down the bed, laying on her stomach and bringing herself face to face with Agatha’s closed thighs. Would it be weird if she started kicking her feet? </p><p> </p><p>“I'm turning off the lights.” she get out quickly, not even waiting for Rio's response as she reaches over to flick the switch, plunging them into darkness.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows immediately shoot up in alarm, her inner pussy-eater unhappy with the idea of not being able to see Agatha’s face when she finishes. She opens her mouth to protest but then reminds herself that this is about making Agatha comfortable and happy. If she needs the lights off, then the lights need to be off. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Okay, I’m ready.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s previous discomfort at her best friend’s words vanishes in an instant. Her fingers dance their way up Agatha’s outer thigh until they reach the hem of the pitcher’s ruined sleep shorts. She works herself under the fabric, pausing to get permission from Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio… please, don’t make me ask again.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Well, that’s really all Rio needed to hear. Within the span of a millisecond, the bottoms are smoothly guided down Agatha’s legs, leaving her in just her camisole and a pair of soaked pink cotton panties. </p><p> </p><p>Rio brings her face up to the proof, breathing in the wonderful scent. Her fingers come up to the waistband of the underwear, getting ready to rid Agatha of them as well. Before she gets the chance, Agatha’s hands fly down to land on top of Rio’s effectively halting the movement.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Wait, I–” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Is something wrong? Do you want me to stop?.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I… i-it’s not… <em> I’m uh… not shaved </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tries to hide the click of saliva in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Can I please eat you out now </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>There is a moment of silence, until Agatha’s hands move off of Rio’s, her fingers entering the hem of her underwear and peeling them off of her center, effectively baring herself for Rio’s hungry gaze.</p><p> </p><p>Not wanting to waste another second, Rio brings her face right to the source, the entire area covered in her arousal. She wraps her arms around Agatha’s thighs, using her hands to hold down the other girl’s hips.</p><p> </p><p>The second her tongue works its way between Agatha’s lips, both girls moan. Agatha’s hands fly down to the back of Rio’s head, her fingers tangling themselves in the dark strands they find there. Rio slowly runs her tongue from Agatha’s entrance to her clit, gathering her taste, filling her mouth with the other girl’s essence. An outside observer might think that Agatha’s slick was the actual fountain of life with the way Rio licked it up, swallowing it like it was the nectar of the gods.</p><p> </p><p>The breathy moans falling from Agatha’s lips only spurred Rio on more, the catcher feeling like she has finally found her purpose in life. On a particularly thorough swipe, Agatha’s hands pull against Rio’s roots deliciously, causing her to groan into Agatha’s folds. Rio’s hips instinctually roll against the crumpled blankets between her legs, searching for any type of friction. The vibrations must have felt earth-shattering based on the way Agatha’s back arched off of the bed, her hips beginning to move on their own accord, grinding her cunt against Rio’s tongue. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>F-Fuck, your mouth feels so good.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s own pace picks up as well, unable to stop herself from moaning into Agatha at the experience of being simultaneously used and praised by her. Her fingers dig further into the flesh of the pitcher’s hips, certain that they will leave little bruises, her orgasm somehow already barreling towards her. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Agatha’s thighs begin to close around Rio’s head, which is always her favorite part of the night. The feeling of pleasing Agatha pushes her over the edge as well, her orgasm crashing over her in a way that leaves her body tingling, her vision going completely black for a second. Or maybe that was the oxygen deprivation? Either way, it was definitely worth it.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally comes down, she relaxes her legs and slowly lowers her hips back onto the mattress. Rio springs free with a slight gasp, the entire bottom half of her face soaked from nose to chin. Despite the full meal she just enjoyed, she licks her lips anyway, even going so far as to swipe the drool off of her cheeks and suck it off of her own fingers. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Jesus, Rio. Has someone been starving you?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to tease but it comes out breathless, taking the bite out of her usual wit. </p><p> </p><p>“Uh yeah, literally you. We could have been doing this for years.” Rio snorts as she lays back against the other pillow. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, was it at least worth the wait?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio doesn’t think she will ever be able to have sex with anyone else ever again.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you could say that.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The next morning, Agatha is up before her alarm, Rio still passed out on the side of her. The two of them had fallen asleep cuddled up together after their… activities.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>How did they get here?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She takes the time to run through all of the signs she missed, everything that might have led her to this moment.</p><p> </p><p>Five years of making out with Ralph, and she has never once had the desire to take it any further. Five minutes of making out with Rio, and they almost needed to change the bedsheets underneath her.</p><p> </p><p>She finally gets the hype. If she had known what sex can feel like, she would have been wanting it all the time too. Actually, she already wants it again, right now, ideally and exclusively with Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Wait, does this mean she is a <em> lesbian</em>? </p><p> </p><p>She looks over at Rio, her face squished against the pillows as soft snores escape her slightly open mouth. The newly risen sun lighting the room in soft yellow hues, illuminating Rio’s tan skin with a stunning glow. Her shorter dark brown hair spread out wildly around her head, contrasting with the pure white hotel sheets. The sight makes her heart clench uncomfortably in her chest, its beat gaining speed at the heavenly image of the sleeping girl in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Yep, definitely a lesbian.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She always knew there was something different about herself, something not quite like the other girls. In her catholic middle school, she thought they were all pretending to have crushes on the other boys in their class, influenced by shows on the Disney channel her mother never let her watch. Whenever asked who she liked, she would always pretend like it was a big secret, one she couldn’t possibly share with anyone else. The truth was? She hated them all.</p><p> </p><p>In highschool, things became a little trickier. There were school dances, and proms, and teenagers making out behind the bleachers, none of which interested her. She had convinced herself it was because she was simply<em> better </em> than everyone else, undistracted in the face of fleeting hormonal temptations. When questioned by friends and family during this stage, it was always easier to pretend like she was waiting for the <em> ‘right one’</em>, or simply too busy to keep up with a boyfriend. </p><p> </p><p>By her senior year, her mother was sick of waiting for Agatha to finally choose a man, so she chose for her. She was sent on a series of first dates with her mom’s church friend’s sons, all who were pushy, boring, or just plain gross. At the time, Ralph had seemed like a good option. He assured her they could wait until marriage, something she valued due to the fact that she already knew she wasn’t interested in having sex. What she didn’t know was that he had planned to propose to her after their high school graduation ceremony, a loophole of sorts. </p><p> </p><p>Softball had been there for her many times, but this is where it saved her.</p><p> </p><p>Growing up, Agatha’s mother had kept her on a tight leash. School, practice, pitching lessons, home. She was never allowed to have sleepovers or go to the mall with friends. Her mother always said ‘<em>Idle hands are the devil’s playthings'</em>, which meant every moment of free time needed to be utilized in the name of productivity. The hard work was easy to swallow when she thought it could earn her mother’s approval. </p><p> </p><p>The validation may have never come but Agatha luckily loved softball anyway, pitching being her favorite part. She liked being the center of the team, getting to control the game with the palm of her hand. This became especially true in highschool, when she got good enough to hit her spots, the other players only getting to field a ball when she rarely missed her intended target. </p><p> </p><p>She liked not relying on anyone, and she <em> definitely </em> liked winning. </p><p> </p><p>While her peers were out on dates, she spent many nights researching different types of pitches and grips, expanding her knowledge and bettering her skills. Today, while she does have her favorites, Agatha can still confidently throw almost every iteration in the book. It’s one of the reasons she was recruited to a D1 school. She was definitely not one of the fastest in her region, but the precision of her arm was impressive to anyone who knew the game.</p><p> </p><p>It could have been any time filler for all her mother cared, she even tried to convince Agatha to try out a more ‘dignified’ activity, like tennis or the violin, but none of them stuck like softball did. She liked the physicality and the aggression of it all, a time and place where she was celebrated for following her natural instincts, for just being herself.</p><p> </p><p>When it came to Ralph’s proposal, her softball scholarship was her salvation. She actually had quite a few different interested coaches, but her mother insisted she commit to Westview due to it having a high acceptance rate, which allowed Ralph to follow her. It also happened to be the closest offering university to her and Ralph’s families in Salem, not that any of them ever came to any of her games. </p><p> </p><p>She was somehow able to convince everyone that the engagement and family planning needed to wait until after college. A free bachelor’s degree was just too good of a deal to pass up, even though her mother insisted she wouldn’t need one once she got pregnant.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t hate the idea of having kids, but she struggled with the concept of becoming a <em> wife </em> and a <em> mother. </em> The image of her barefoot in a kitchen, dutifully doting on her husband just never sat right with her.</p><p> </p><p>Now, staring at Rio’s adorable, sleeping face, she thinks maybe it wouldn’t be so bad to be married, to hear tiny feet running around a modest colonial while she cooks her family dinner. Their children sporting big blue eyes and a charming tiny tooth gap…</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Jesus, is she already picturing a life with Rio— </em>
</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>
<b> <em>WE AT THE HOTEL, MOTEL, HOLIDAY INN,</em> </b>
</p><p>
<b> <em>SHE LIKE THAT FREAKY STUFF, TWO IN THE O, AND ONE IN THE EYE, THAT KINKY STUFF–</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>The stupid song on Rio’s phone blares through the room, almost sending Agatha flying off of the bed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is also startled awake, her eyes blinking open right before she frantically scrambles across the mattress, reaching for her nightstand to hit the snooze button on the screen.</p><p> </p><p>The room is plunged into silence again, Agatha’s hand clutching at her rapidly beating heart, as Rio flops back down next to her.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, Rio. Are you trying to give me a heart attack?”</p><p> </p><p>At the sound of Agatha’s voice, Rio rolls over to face her.</p><p> </p><p>“And a good morning to you too, sunshine.”</p><p> </p><p>A soft sleepy smile crinkles the catcher’s features, her eyes filled with so much affection that Agatha feels like her heart might <em> actually </em> be bursting now. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> How could she ever stay mad at the girl when she is looking at her like that? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You know that’s always the alarm I pick for overnight away games! It’s bad luck if we aren’t awakened by the <em> Ballad of Holiday’s Inn,</em> a blessing from Sir Worldwide, bard to the Westview State Women’s Softball team.” </p><p> </p><p>She gasps with faux sincerity, scandalized by the mere thought of not sticking with their traditions. Rio always chose the weirdest superstitions.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a dork, I can’t believe I let you anywhere near me last night.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes widen slightly at Agatha’s reminder, but she plays along.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I don’t remember you complaining,” she brings her hand up to her chin, feigning an expression of deep thought, “In fact, I am pretty sure someone was <em>beggin </em>–”</p><p> </p><p>Her reminiscing is interrupted with a harsh slap to her arm.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, who knew you were blessed with such a good memory?” she grits out sarcastically, as she moves swiftly, placing herself on top of Rio, mirroring their positions from last night.</p><p> </p><p>“I wonder if you can manage to remember how to do it again…”</p><p> </p><p>A devilish smirk appears on her face as she leans down, closing the majority of the distance between the two of them.</p><p> </p><p>Inches before their lips meet, she pauses.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Do you think you can handle that, Captain?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches Rio’s throat bob on a gulp, as the catcher’s gaze drifts down to her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Only one way to find out.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>It comes out breathless, like the experience of Agatha being on top of her has somehow knocked the wind out of her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>Seconds later, Rio lunges forward, finally slotting their mouths together again. </p><p> </p><p>Despite all of the thinking Agatha did this morning, she had somehow forgotten just <em> how fucking good this feels. </em></p><p> </p><p>Her whole body suddenly burning, every atom buzzing with the other girl's attention. Rio’s hands move down her body, bringing an electrical current with them. Her fingers glide across the skin leading to where Agatha needs her, <em> and God how does she already need her? </em></p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally makes it to the area just above her curls, she stills, pulling her face away from Agatha’s, softly disconnecting their lips.</p><p> </p><p>“You seem… calmer than I thought you’d be…”</p><p> </p><p>Honestly? Agatha feels calmer than she thought she’d be. Despite the small spiral she had this morning, being with Rio is just so easy. When she looks into the catcher’s rich brown eyes, it feels like her brain turns off completely, like she can’t help but be present in every moment with her. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you going to keep wasting time talking to me,<em> or</em> <em>can we get back to the fun part</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>She punctuates her words with a filthy roll of her hips, the arousal already beginning to grow between her legs. Instead of answering with words, Rio playfully rolls her eyes before lifting her head off of the pillow, inviting Agatha to close the rest of the distance between them. </p><p> </p><p>This kiss feels different from the others, their lips moving against each other with intention. The hunger is still there, but it’s as if it is buried under a new layer of intimacy, the air around them suddenly feeling thick with tenderness and care.</p><p> </p><p>Kissing Rio is everything she didn’t know she needed. Now that she has had it, she can never imagine being without it again. She could see herself doing this for hours, days even, until their lips are raw and they have swapped enough spit that Rio’s DNA has worked its way deep inside of her body, taking root in her bones, mixing with her own–</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>WE AT THE HOTEL, MOTEL, HOLIDA—</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls back with a groan, her hands leaving their place on Agatha’s hips to hide the embarrassment on her face as the previously snoozed alarm plays once more.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls off of her with a hearty laugh, “I can’t believe I almost just let you touch me again! Have you cast a spell on me, Captain?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It sure feels like it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Oh shut up, you love it.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She really does. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, we should get dressed anyway... After all, those alarms are not only for entertainment purposes”, Rio throws her a cheeky wink as she hops off the bed, heading over to her bag to grab her uniform for the day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, stays right where she is. The thought of leaving this bed, this room where everything changed, suddenly terrifies her. What if Rio doesn’t want her when they get home? What if she gets scared and runs away again? What if this is the last time–</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t we just stay here for the rest of our lives? Spend our final days in this very nice hotel room? There’s maids, and room service, and the view of a fairly gorgeous parking lot! What more could we need?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles at Agatha’s words before looking back at the bed. When she sees the absence of humor on the pitcher’s face, her smile drops. She makes her way back to Agatha, leaning against the mattress.</p><p> </p><p>She pauses for a second, looking like she is trying to find the right words. When nothing seems to come, she instead leans in, planting a gentle kiss against Agatha’s lips, which she happily accepts. She moves to deepen the kiss, wishing to prolong the moment, but Rio doesn’t let her.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she pulls away, Agatha spotting a new sparkle in her eye, like she’s just solved the puzzle.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s get ready, and we can talk about it when we get home, okay? Right now, we have a game to win.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a steadying breath. </p><p> </p><p>They will talk about it later… she just needs to be patient…</p><p> </p><p>She can do that… it’s just a few hours…</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Everything will be fine. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> — </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Half an hour later, they are piling onto the bus, Rio following Agatha straight to their normal row, back to the way it is meant to be. When they are settled in their seats, Agatha rises to her knees, Rio’s hair in hand as she starts her braiding process. The short brown locks feel soft and silky in her hands, the catcher practically purring at the feeling of Agatha’s nails on her scalp as she creates the part. </p><p> </p><p>When Cass walks on five minutes later, she stills at the sight of the pair. Her eyes go wide as they meet Agatha’s narrowed ones, Rio still smiling cluelessly while looking out the window ahead of her. Seeing the opportunity, Agatha leans down, brushing her lips against the shell of Rio’s ear, her fingers tightening their grip enough to tug on the other girl’s roots.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I can’t wait to take these braids out later, I love when you let me play with your hair.” </em></p><p> </p><p>A shiver immediately runs up Rio’s spine at the tone Agatha uses with her technically innocuous words, the tips of her ears heating up against Agatha’s palms.</p><p> </p><p>A quick glance back at the aisle tells her that Cass definitely got the message, a subtle pout gracing her face as she chooses to sit in an empty row. </p><p> </p><p>The possessive monster that had been occupying Agatha’s body all week puffs its chest out with pride. One word running on a loop in her brain as she ties off her first braid:</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Mine.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>When they get to the field, Lilia announces that Cass will be the starting pitcher for the game, which is understandable. Rest the ace against the team you already beat, so that they are ready for the next round of playoffs. If this was yesterday, Agatha would have torn the field apart, she would have made everyone pay. </p><p> </p><p>Today? She happily takes her place on the bench after warm ups, grateful for the break. </p><p> </p><p>As the game progresses, Agatha can’t help the smile on her face as she watches Rio perform. She doesn’t get this angle often, normally too wrapped up actually playing the game to appreciate how incredible Rio truly is. She frames every pitch perfectly, even with Cass barely hitting her spots. The runners on base are also clearly scared of her, her arm famously noted as one of the strongest in the league.</p><p> </p><p>But what really gets Agatha’s attention is the small braids peeking out of the back of the catcher’s helmet, the shy smiles she sends to Agatha whenever they make eye contact through the fence, the way Rio easily ignores Cass’s flirty looks, as if it’s not even a conscious effort.</p><p> </p><p>It also doesn’t help that the tight softball pants hug her muscular thighs perfectly, the delicious curve of her ass on full display in her permanent squatting position. All she can think about is how those legs would feel wrapped around her head. She wants to taste her, Rio somehow making her crave something she has never even had.</p><p> </p><p>Images start flashing through her head, her sitting in Rio’s lap, Rio on her knees worshipping with her tongue, her mouth kissing Agatha’s neck, <em> her teeth</em>–</p><p> </p><p>“There’s that smile! I knew you two would work it out.”</p><p> </p><p>Coach Lilia’s voice pulls her out of her thoughts, forcing her eyes away from Rio. She feels her face heat up after getting caught smiling, while fantasizing about her best friend’s mouth… again. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, we uh… talked things out.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice comes out a little squeakier than she would have liked but Lilia doesn’t seem to notice, turning back to the game to send Rio her next pitch call.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>By the end of the final inning, Agatha’s gut felt wound up tighter than the muscles in her pitching shoulder, Rio unknowingly torturing her by being her ridiculously attractive self. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes followed every drop of sweat, every flex of her arm muscles. She felt entranced, like she couldn’t look away. Her body suddenly craved the catcher, taking advantage of every opportunity to put her hands on her. She helped her gear up between innings, fixed her braids when they got messy from her helmet, put a hand on her back whenever she needed to get by. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t get enough. Watching Rio in her element was almost too much to bear, she could hardly keep still with the arousal coursing hot through her veins. </p><p> </p><p>Now she understood how all the other girls felt. </p><p> </p><p>During home games, there was a running joke that Rio had her own fan club, local sapphics from the campus showing up in the stands with Rio’s number on their signs. She had always silently understood where they were coming from, even back then she could acknowledge how attractive her best friend was.</p><p> </p><p>There were also the girls at the bars, parties, and in Rio’s classes. The poor thing was constantly being hit on by desperate women, chasing after her like a carrot on a stick. </p><p> </p><p>There was the occasional girlfriend, but Rio never brought them around to meet Agatha, for some unknown reason. Instead, she would disappear for a few weeks, Agatha only getting the chance to see her at practice or in the house. It would always make her uncomfortable, Rio choosing to spend her time with a girl who wasn’t Agatha, but luckily she never suffered for long.</p><p> </p><p>The relationships would always end within the month, to Agatha’s pleasure, the catcher never being able to commit to anyone for long. She could always spot the unlucky souls, leaving the party crying whenever Rio would walk in. At the time, she had felt bad for them, grateful that her best friend always came back home to her at the end of the day. Now? The mere thought of Rio touching anyone else made her feel sick to her fucking stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Having experienced a night with Rio? She gets it. She too would plead insanity if she ever lost this. She could barely handle the few days Rio avoided her when they were just friends, she can’t imagine the pain she would feel now. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> There is a possibility of this ending in disaster… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She quickly shakes her head to discard the thought.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>When the game was over and won, she helped Rio pack away her gear, happy to use any excuse to be near the other girl. </p><p> </p><p>She could barely even think about the fact that they had just officially made it to the Women's College World Series for the first time in school history, too distracted by the way her panties were clinging to her core. The smell of Rio’s warm, sun kissed skin completely smothering out all other coherent thoughts. It took everything in her to not drag Rio to a private corner, push her up against the nearest hard surface, and beg for more. </p><p> </p><p>It felt as if Rio opened Pandora’s box last night, every last repressed hormone flooding her system at once. It was getting to the point where she felt like she was actually struggling to think about literally anything else.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Guess that’s what happens when you go twenty-one years without a proper orgasm. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The team stops by the field’s locker rooms to change into normal clothes after the win, no one interested in being stuck on a bus in their dusty, sweaty uniforms.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio comes back out in gray sweatpants and a tank top, Agatha accepts that this may be the longest three hour ride of her life.</p><p> </p><p>They take their seats on the bus and Agatha tries to reason with herself. All she has to do is avoid looking at, smelling, or touching Rio… even though she is currently sitting less than a foot away from her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Should be manageable… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She closes her eyes. Maybe she can try to sleep through it, avoiding the majority of the torture. </p><p> </p><p>Images of the previous night immediately begin playing behind her lids, Rio’s head in between her thighs, barely visible in the sliver of moonlight filtering in through the hotel curtains. Agatha’s hands tangled in her hair, Rio’s hips moving against the mattress. If she thinks hard enough, she can even feel the phantom sensations of Rio moaning into her, the vibrations of the sound scratching an itch she never knew she had. </p><p> </p><p>She can feel herself unconsciously beginning to squirm in her seat, unable to get comfortable. She squeezes her eyes shut tighter but the picture just becomes clearer, she can’t escape it. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Agatha?” </em></p><p> </p><p>The voice that has been haunting her whispers in her ear, causing her to jump out of her seat and into the aisle, her movements reminiscent of a kid with their hand caught in the cookie jar. </p><p> </p><p>“Woah! Where’s the fire? I was just going to ask if you wanted to listen to music with me? You know, the ‘<em>After Dub Playlist </em>’ can’t listen to itself.”</p><p> </p><p>She looks up at Agatha with the dopiest smile she has ever seen, making her heart and stomach clench at the same time. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Does Rio not understand that she has ruined her? That she can’t look at her without wanting to climb her like a tree? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I need to go to the bathroom.” She states matter of factly, trying to make her voice sound as neutral as possible.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I see. Well in that case, go piss girl.” </p><p> </p><p>The reuse of the old meme and Rio’s accompanying shit-eating grin would normally earn her a snort and an eyeroll, maybe even a punch on the shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Right now, all Agatha can manage is a tight lipped nod, as she makes her way to the back of the bus. </p><p> </p><p>When the door finally closes behind her, she grabs onto the sides of the sink trying to ground herself in the moment. </p><p> </p><p>She looks up and into the mirror in front of her, barely recognizing the girl reflected back.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes look wild, her pupils as round as saucers. Her cheeks are flushed, redness painting the skin of her chest. She looks like a caged animal, clawing at the bars of her enclosure. She turns on the faucet, tossing some water in her face and on the back of her neck, hoping to cool down. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She is supposed to be better than this. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes another moment to compose herself, trying to look as normal as possible. She grabs some toilet paper to try and ease the uncomfortable amount of wetness in her underwear. It’s as if the other girl forgot to shut the faucet off last night, a steady drip of arousal leaking out of her for hours, her body staying painfully ready for whenever Rio wants her again.</p><p> </p><p>This is completely ridiculous. She may not have as much experience as Rio, but that doesn’t mean she should be the only one suffering.</p><p> </p><p>Wait… <em> now that’s a good idea</em>. </p><p> </p><p>She needs to turn the tables, she needs to gain the upper hand. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She needs to make Rio feel as crazy as she does. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The thought brings with it her first shred of peace in days. She just needs to take control of the field. <em> She needs to play the game </em>. </p><p> </p><p>With a new perspective on the situation, she looks herself over once more. Her hair is wilder than normal, the early summer humidity making her locks look more like a lion’s mane. She splashes some water on it, running her fingers through the strands, taming it down to an acceptable height. She then moves to her outfit, a loose fitting white tank top with jean shorts. </p><p> </p><p>Inspiration strikes when she sees her nipples already straining faintly through the fabric, a mix of her arousal and the bus’s AC. </p><p> </p><p>She reaches behind her back, unclipping her bra, pulling it off cleanly through her shirt sleeve. She gives herself some encouragement, pinching the buds until they are too noticeable to ignore. </p><p> </p><p>Ready for the next phase of her plan, she returns to the aisle, making her way back to her prey– <em> back to Rio. </em></p><p> </p><p>When she finally arrives at her seat, Rio glances up at the noise, smiling as she takes in her best friend, before her eyes shamelessly land on Agatha’s chest. The reaction is immediate, her mouth falling slightly open as her gaze moves back and forth between her breasts, her pupils behaving like they are stuck in a pinball machine.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Agatha–” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Sorry this bra was totally cutting into my shoulders, figured it’d be easier to just take it off.”</p><p> </p><p>She shrugs before Rio can finish her thought, morphing the sound of her voice into the most clueless and innocent tone she can muster, hoping Rio sees right through her. </p><p> </p><p>She plops herself back onto the cushions, leaning into Rio’s space, “My bag is in the overhead still, do you think you can hold onto this for me?”</p><p> </p><p>She whispers as she offers the lacy black piece of fabric to Rio, the other girl wordlessly accepting the offering into her hands, her eyes tracking the bra reverently, like a devout Catholic accepting her communion.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Too easy.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“God, it’s just so hot in here.” Agatha lies through her teeth as she sweeps all of her hair into her hand, exposing the curve of her neck and collarbones, while pushing her chest out, her nipples almost completely visible through the thin fabric.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, who is still silently holding her bra, tracks the movement, her eyes devouring the freshly bared skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you put it up for me?” she pouts, holding her elastic out for Rio to take.</p><p> </p><p>She hears an audible gulp as she turns her body to face into the aisle, purposefully hiding the smug smirk that is taking over her face.</p><p> </p><p>There’s a shuffle, most likely Rio pocketing her bra, before the band is delicately taken from her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>The second Rio’s hands land in her waves, her teeth sink into her bottom lip, trying to stifle an instinctual moan. After hours of fantasizing about the catcher’s touch, her body feels extra sensitive, every point of contact between the two of them throwing gasoline on the raging fire that runs like molten lava under her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gathers up her hair, her grip tighter than necessary as she tries to wrangle every last strand into her fist, the controlling hold causing a small whimper to leave her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s movements pause for a moment, the sound catching her attention like a twig snapping in the woods.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha realizes what’s happening, she feels a pull forcing her head back onto Rio’s shoulder. She is unable to stop herself, a breathy gasp escaping her throat at the sensation of pain mixing with pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Are you actually turned on right now?!”  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath feels hot against her cheek, as she hisses the accusation. The hold in her hair so tight that she is unable to turn her head. Her voice is hushed but firm, sending a chill down her spine.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It’s perfect. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You’re a big girl aren’t you? Figure it out yourself.” </em></p><p> </p><p>She can’t help but shoot back, trying to hide her obvious desire under a paper thin coating of defiance. Something about Rio’s sudden dominance makes her want to mouth off, to see how far she can push the other girl before she snaps.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>If I had known you would be such a brat, I would have spanked you when I had the chance. Is that what you want me to do, Agatha?” </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Hm, I don’t know… Why don’t you tell me?” </em></p><p> </p><p>She grabs Rio’s free hand, guiding it over her stomach to the hem of her jeans.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Feel for yourself, Captain.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t hesitate, too far gone to care at this point. She doesn't even bother unbuttoning the shorts, her hands squeezing under the waistband, landing directly amongst her soaked curls.</p><p> </p><p>Both of Agatha’s hands come up to cover her mouth, thankful for Wanda's obnoxiously loud pop music, and that the university’s athletics department always springs for a big coach bus, allowing a solid two rows between them and their nearest teammates.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio’s fingers finally make contact, gliding through her puffy folds, her hips instinctually buck up, silently begging for more. The movement causes a groan to rumble in Rio’s chest, vibrating against Agatha’s back. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Fuck, baby, have you been wet like this all day?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio continues to move her hand underneath the fabric, creating a very noticeable bulge in the front of her shorts. The sight, combined with the pet name, and the feeling of Rio’s teasing fingers almost pushes her over the edge right there, her body grasping for relief after being left on edge all day. </p><p> </p><p><em> “What can I say? You look good behind the plate.” </em>Her whispered words come out breathless and whiny, the quiver of her voice giving away just how bad she wants it.</p><p> </p><p>This is a dangerous game and they both know it. Agatha needs more, and Rio clearly wants to give it to her, something that should absolutely, under no circumstances, happen on this bus.</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>When the tips of Rio’s fingers brush against her clit, Agatha chooses to bite down against the flesh of her palm, forcing the incriminating moan back down her throat. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>That’s a good girl, stay nice and quiet for me.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Despite her praise, Rio’s grip in Agatha’s hair gets impossibly tighter. She feels tears begin to prick the corners of her eyes as her gaze is forced towards the ceiling, the pain somehow heightening the experience. </p><p> </p><p>The catcher’s other hand begins to pick up a pace, rubbing tight, feather light circles against the overly sensitive bud. The sensation straddles the line of pleasure and over-stimulation, quickly working Agatha closer to her finish.</p><p> </p><p>She desperately gasps for air against her own hand, her hips moving subtly as she tries to take more, her orgasm within reach–</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, the bus comes to an abrupt stop, rolling Agatha off of Rio’s lap and onto the floor with a thump. </p><p> </p><p>“<b>We’re here!</b>”</p><p> </p><p>Coach Sharon calls from the front of the bus, her cheery voice immediately grating against Agatha’s ears.</p><p> </p><p>“Now I just want to remind everyone, only two scoops per person! And don’t even think about going crazy with the toppings!”</p><p> </p><p>
<em>What the fuck?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She looks up at Rio, the other girl’s face glowing with amusement as she nonchalantly sucks on the fingertips that were just in Agatha’s shorts, her lips smacking like she just finished a gourmet meal.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Does she think this is funny? Does Rio have a fucking death wish? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She feels her face go red, a mix of embarrassment and frustration. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha quickly scrambles to her feet as she hears her teammates start making their way down the aisle. Rio has the audacity to giggle, completely unbothered by the fact that she has now left Agatha soaking wet and on the edge.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t even bother looking back at Rio, tossing a middle finger in the other girl’s direction as she stomps her way off of the bus. Everything feels uncomfortable and irritating, relief only coming in the quick moments that she allows her thighs to press together. Her gut feels twisted, like her insides are tied in an impossible knot, her scalp still aching with the ghost of Rio’s grip. </p><p> </p><p>She orders two scoops of strawberry in a cone, sitting on one of the picnic benches as she sports the meanest look she can muster. </p><p> </p><p>Everyone seems smart enough to avoid her, taking one look at her energy and deciding it’s not worth the trouble. Everyone except for fucking Rio, who happily plops down across from her, mindlessly licking at the treat like her hand wasn’t just in Agatha’s jeans five minutes ago. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s wrong, Captain? You seem a little… <em> on edge. </em> Is something bothering you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio teases with an evil grin, testing Agatha’s already flimsy stance against first degree murder.</p><p> </p><p>Instead of answering, Agatha narrows her eyes further. If only looks could kill…</p><p> </p><p>“I’m so happy you two are back to normal.” Coach Lilia suddenly appears, plopping down next to Rio on the bench with her own ice cream, Coach Sharon not far behind.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Can no one read a fucking room anymore? </em>
</p><p> </p><p> “Thanks for making us share, Coach! I feel like we are <em> so much closer </em>now that we have worked through it.”</p><p> </p><p>The mischievous arrogance in Rio’s voice sends a pulse right down to Agatha’s achingly empty core, forcing her to cross her legs under the table. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Stupid fucking Rio. Who does she think she is? Stupid smug smirk with her stupid tiny tooth gap and her stupidly long fingers wrapped around– </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I, for one, am ecstatic to see the dynamic duo getting along again! You two are just perfect together!”</p><p> </p><p>Coach Sharon pipes in, mindlessly licking at her own ice cream.</p><p> </p><p>At her words, the smug smirk from Rio’s face vanishes, her cheeks turning pink as she turns her gaze towards the floor. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> That’s… interesting.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>After their celebratory ice cream pitstop, the girls loaded back onto the bus. Agatha made the wise choice to ignore Rio for the rest of the ride, her eyes closed, headphones in. </p><p> </p><p>She isn’t sure if she is capable of looking at Rio without strangling or straddling her, so best not to take her chances. </p><p> </p><p>When they finally arrive back at their campus, the bus pulls up in front of their house. Their teammates are all talking about potentially throwing another victory party, but Agatha ignores them. </p><p> </p><p>There is only one thing on her mind as she grabs her bags and heads towards her room, Rio trailing closely behind her. </p><p> </p><p>When they are out of ear shot, the catcher starts rambling in a hushed tone. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey? Are you mad at me?”</p><p> </p><p>They enter through the front door, Agatha’s gaze trained straight ahead.</p><p> </p><p>“Look, I’m sorry if I took things too far on the bus...”</p><p> </p><p>They make their way up the three flights of stairs.</p><p> </p><p>“I know we agreed to talk when we got home and… I kind of jumped the gun.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s door closes behind them, the moment she has been waiting for all day. </p><p> </p><p>Her hands go limp, dropping her stuff on the floor with a thud. </p><p> </p><p>“You just looked so pretty and I–”</p><p> </p><p>Rio cuts herself off when Agatha finally turns around, meeting her eye for the first time since the bus stopped for ice cream.</p><p> </p><p>“Just… <em> Please don’t run away again</em>…”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice is soft and vulnerable, her lip unintentionally jutting out in a slight pout. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> God, please forgive her for the things she wants to do to this woman.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She takes one quick step, closing the distance between them in an instant, Rio’s back hits the door as her own bags drop to the floor. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cups her face in her hands, looking up at Rio through her thick lashes. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>J</em><em>ust… shut the fuck up.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha <em>finally </em>slots their lips together again, bringing Rio’s face forward to meet her in the middle. There’s a moment of shocked silence, Rio’s body going completely rigid, before her shoulders finally melt, her own hands landing on Agatha’s hips as she fervently returns the gesture.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Is it really always going to feel this good?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her whole body pulses with want, her skin humming as Rio’s fingers accidentally press into the bruises she left on Agatha’s waist last night.</p><p> </p><p>Their lips break apart and crush back together over and over again, thin strands of saliva never getting far enough to break apart. The tenderness from their kiss this morning is nowhere to be found, as their tongues find each other quickly, fighting for control. The urge to consume the other girl is overpowering, their breathy moans filling the otherwise empty bedroom. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls back first, already needing more, the arousal from earlier still painting the fabric of her underwear. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio, I need you to get on the bed and fuck me like your life depends on it.” </em></p><p> </p><p>The speed at which Rio throws herself onto the mattress is almost supernatural, an ill timed blink and Agatha would have thought the catcher had teleported.</p><p> </p><p>Seeing how much Rio wants her makes every inch of her skin burn, her clothes suddenly too tight against the flesh. She quickly peels every last article off of her frame, leaving her completely naked as she saunters over to a still fully clothed Rio.</p><p> </p><p>If the catcher’s eyes weren’t securely attached to their sockets, they surely would have fallen out as her lids disappeared underneath her eyebrows. Her cheeks flush as she takes in Agatha’s fully bare body for the first time.</p><p> </p><p>She quickly climbs on the bed, straddling Rio’s lap and gently lowering herself against the soft material of Rio’s sweatpants. </p><p> </p><p>As she is about to lean down, eager to meet Rio’s lips once more, her best friend silently raises her hands, signaling Agatha to pause her advances. Her eyes travel down her body, memorizing every last stretch mark and freckle, studying it as if she were preparing for a final exam.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio… please…” </em></p><p> </p><p>She whines as complex language evades her. <em> Is Rio really going to make her beg? </em></p><p> </p><p>“<em>I know, baby… I just wanted to see you first.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands move slowly, every movement conveying adoration. Her fingers glide over the ridges of her rib cage, her gaze tracking the goosebumps left in their wake. When she finally reaches the curve of Agatha’s breasts her breath hitches, cupping the soft pale flesh in her palm. Her thumbs take a moment to swipe over the peaks, forcing them to raise to attention under her touch. </p><p> </p><p>Her torso lifts off of the bed in an instant, her hold forcing Agatha’s back to arche as her warm mouth closes around one of the sensitive buds. The space between her thighs becomes warmer, her arousal leaking a wet spot onto Rio’s crotch. Her teeth come down into her lip, attempting to stifle a completely wrecked groan.</p><p> </p><p>She has never experienced anything like this, her body pulsing with pure greed.</p><p> </p><p>She wants it all. Every nip of her teeth, every drop of her saliva, Rio’s fingerprints seared into the surface of her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha has to fight her instincts to keep her gaze trained on the crown of Rio’s bobbing head, her body begging her to slam her eyes shut to focus on the sensations.</p><p> </p><p>Her hips roll down on their own accord, silently begging Rio to say '<em>Amen </em>’ and finish up her worship as she clenches around nothing. </p><p> </p><p>Rio hums around her in understanding, the vibrations spreading out across the planes of her skin, the knot in her stomach pulling tighter. </p><p> </p><p>A whine rattles around in her throat, Agatha no longer able to suppress her natural reactions. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally pulls back to admire her work, Agatha’s chest is covered in small bruises and spit. Her best friend’s lips are swollen from their attack, the rich brown of her eyes disappearing behind a sea of pure black. Her face is beet red and her hands are flexing with want, as if she is using every last muscle in her body to restrain herself from sucking her claim into Agatha’s body for the rest of the night.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Yes, yes, we get it, they're yours, dear. Now, can you please hurry up and fuck me?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha growls out, unable to hide the desperation in her voice. Rio’s eyes widen at the insinuation, that her veneration was a result of her desire to possess rather than a sign of her devotion. Before she can argue, Agatha pushes against her shoulders, forcing her back to lay flush with the comforter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio quickly forgets her offense, her hands moving to the back of Agatha’s head, pulling her down until they share the same breath. When their lips finally reconnect, Agatha lets out an unintentional sigh, her hips beginning to pick up a pace as she grinds herself against the slick soaked fabric of Rio’s sweatpants.</p><p> </p><p>Remembering Agatha’s <em>very </em> clear message, Rio’s dominant hand untangles itself from the pitcher’s roots. Agatha lifts up her hips, inviting Rio to slip the appendage into the space between them. Her fingers meet no resistance as they glide easily through her arousal, coating them with pure want. </p><p> </p><p>Her finger tips brush against Agatha’s drooling slit, causing them both to pause. Their mouths separate, their foreheads resting against each other. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Take what you need. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whispers into the inch of air between them, as a lone slender finger pushes into her tight heat. The catcher stops at the first knuckle, seeing the slight wince of pain at the initial intrusion. She’s never had anything bigger than a tampon inside of herself, the Catholic guilt working overtime on the rare occasion that she ever felt the desire to masturbate. </p><p> </p><p>She sits there for a second, body frozen, as she tries to adjust, more slick leaking out of her to help with the stretch. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>There you go, Agatha. Let me in, sweetheart.” </em></p><p> </p><p>At Rio’s gentle encouragement, Agatha’s body immediately clamps down around the digit, unintentionally sucking it in until it is buried to the hilt. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Holy fuck </em>”</p><p> </p><p>She’s not sure who says it but, either way, she agrees with the sentiment. Having Rio inside of her like this feels otherworldly, a piece of the puzzle she never even realized she was missing. </p><p> </p><p>Her body feels tingly, her mind finally rendered silent. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> How did she live for so long without this? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s finger begins to move, softly curling against her front wall. She can feel it everywhere, from the sweat gathering at her hairline to her toes curling into the sheets.</p><p> </p><p>Without commanding them to do so, Agatha’s hips begin to move. </p><p> </p><p>She tries bouncing first, gently lifting herself off of Rio’s lap and then dropping back down.</p><p> </p><p>The moan that escapes her parted lips would be embarrassing any other day, but right now? She is too blissed out to care. She’d let out a hundred humiliating moans if it meant she got to feel like this a hundred times.</p><p> </p><p>She attempts to sit up straight, needing more leverage for her movements, but Rio’s finger only sinks deeper, filling her to the brim. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>You’re so fucking beautiful. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>She opens her eyes, unsure of when she even closed them, meeting Rio’s half-lidded gaze filled with unashamed reverence, as if she is staring straight past the gates of heaven, face-to-face with paradise. </p><p> </p><p>That look alone causes Agatha’s walls to flutter, the release she has been chasing all day suddenly barreling towards her. </p><p> </p><p>She picks up her pace, grinding her clit against the heel of Rio’s newly raised palm. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>F-fuck just like that, G-God– Rio, please!” </em></p><p> </p><p>Her eyes slam shut as her orgasm<em> finally </em> crashes over her. Her thighs clamp around Rio’s forearm, forcing her to leave her finger buried inside of her as she rides the wave of relief taking over her body. </p><p> </p><p>When she can finally breathe again, she lets herself fall forward onto Rio’s chest, nuzzling against her neck. She inches her face closer to the skin, the other girl’s scent making her head feel heavy. </p><p> </p><p>They lay like that for a few minutes, Rio rubbing circles into Agatha’s bare back with one hand, while the other remains tucked between the pitcher’s legs.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I do you next?”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice is softer than she’s ever heard it, her usually sarcastic and cocky tone curiously missing after getting fucked so thoroughly.</p><p> </p><p>“Only if you want to, Agatha. I understand if you’re tired, it’s been a long day.”</p><p> </p><p>She punctuates her words with a tender kiss to Agatha’s forehead.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, I’m a collegiate fucking athlete. Do you really think one orgasm is enough to stop me from eating you out right now?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And, she’s back. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio giggles at the sudden change in tone, jostling Agatha who is still laying limply against her chest. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha could listen to that sound for the rest of her life. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She wiggles out of Rio’s hold and works her way down between her legs. She taps on Rio’s thigh, silently requesting her best friend to remove the ruined sweatpants.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going to need to tell me what to do though. I refuse to accept a reality where you’re better than me at something.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so you thought I was good, did you?”</p><p> </p><p>She raises her eyebrows questioningly but it’s clear she already knows the answer.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Smug motherfucker. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Just take off your pants, Rio.”</em></p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>The two weeks following that night have been the best of Rio’s life. </p><p> </p><p>With her and Agatha ‘getting along so well’, the team has been thriving, breezing through the first two rounds of the tournament while barely breaking a sweat, their next game the last stop before making it to the championships.</p><p> </p><p>Off the field has somehow been even better, every inch of her body aching beautifully, her muscles sore from attempting to keep up with Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>She has recently come to the conclusion that her best friend has gone mad with power, a lioness raised in captivity, finally released into the wild. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio is the grateful idiot who opened the cage.</p><p> </p><p>After spending the rest of that first day teaching Agatha <em> almost </em> all of the wonders of lesbian sex, the pitcher has made it her mission to prove why she is at the top of their class, utilizing every opportunity to ‘study’ the material.</p><p> </p><p>Consequently, they have been unable to go a full hour apart since. </p><p> </p><p>Rio on her knees in the locker room after practice, Agatha bent over the side of her own bed, early in the morning and late into the night. She is starting to worry that the other woman is insatiable.</p><p> </p><p>Not that she would ever complain. </p><p> </p><p>They still haven’t really talked about it– whatever ‘it’ is, but Rio is patient and happy to live in the ignorant bliss created by their bubble. </p><p> </p><p>Despite the slight unease that comes with the avoided conversation topic, she personally cannot remember a time that she has ever felt so <em> right </em>, like she is exactly where she is meant to be.</p><p> </p><p>She’s had plenty of flings, a few girlfriends here and there. She has even had amazing, earth shattering sex, but nothing has ever come close to what Agatha has done to her brain chemistry.</p><p> </p><p>Her wires are crossed, her hormones completely out of whack, she feels like an addict. Her heart racing whenever she so much as thinks about the other girl, her fingers twitching against her side, always ready for her next fix.</p><p> </p><p>Not that Agatha’s been any help. A little pointed eye contact and a lip bite is all it takes for Rio’s stomach to start twisting, the dulled heat between her thighs roaring back to life at the pitcher’s beck and call. </p><p> </p><p>That's the situation Rio finds herself in now, two days before their next game.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia tasked her captains with running the team lift, an hour and a half long workout where they are meant to be guiding the other girls through the coach’s predetermined exercises. </p><p> </p><p>Which would be easy if Agatha wasn’t looking at Rio like <em> that</em>. </p><p> </p><p>She first noticed something was wrong on the treadmill. She was well into her run, sweat soaking through her muscle tee, when her gaze naturally landed on Agatha through the mirror. The other girl was standing behind her, body stiff with wide wild eyes, her hungry stare causing a now familiar heat to begin creeping up her neck.</p><p> </p><p>When their eyes finally meet in the reflection, Agatha characteristically shows no shame, her teeth sinking into her bottom lip as she allows herself another full sweep of Rio’s frame.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s feet stutter, almost sending her flying off of the machine, her heart nearly jumping out of her throat. She lowers the dial, slowing the pace down until she is able to come to a full stop. She rests her hands on top of her head, expanding her lungs in order to help her catch her breath. She can feel redness flaring on her cheeks, from the embarrassment of almost falling in front of the whole team or from Agatha’s presence, the culprit is unclear.</p><p> </p><p>She tries to shake it off, like a recovering alcoholic walking past their favorite bar. God, what she wouldn’t do to be back in bed with that girl right now. </p><p> </p><p>A quick look at her watch tells her there is only 45 minutes left in the session. Rio can last 45 minutes easily. She went four years without fucking Agatha, she can certainly wait 45 minutes.</p><p> </p><p>When her breathing finally calms, Rio’s eyes lift from her wrist, landing back on the pitcher.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has moved on to her next set of weighted squats, her thighs trembling slightly as she lowers herself down, her leggings showing off the delicious curve of her ass.</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels herself struggle to swallow.</p><p>
<em><br/>What is this girl doing to her?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She averts her eyes once more, hoping she is able to somehow forget the concept of object permanence. </p><p> </p><p>This is the problem. Rio is weak. </p><p> </p><p>She runs her hands over her heated face as she turns herself away from the sight of temptation. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> 43 minutes and 32 seconds. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She moves onto her next set, which involves mainly arms. She ups her usual weight, happy to have a distraction from her own mind. </p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs the dumbbells and begins with lateral raises before moving to rows, skull crushers, and then bicep curls. Her arms are properly burning now, her mind thankfully returning to the usual quiet that comes with a good workout. </p><p> </p><p>That is until she feels a delicate hand land on her upper back, her body stilling as it immediately recognizes the touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you help stretch me out, <em> Captain?</em> I’m trying to finish this set but my legs are feeling a little sore.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> 34 minutes and 18 seconds.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio can hear the fake pout before she sees it, can sense the intentions behind Agatha’s innocent words. </p><p> </p><p>She knows what this is, and yet she follows anyway, putting her weights back down on the rack before trailing Agatha to the corner of the gym.</p><p> </p><p>The pitcher lays down against the padded floors, her legs parting to offer Rio access as the rest of the team obliviously continues their workout.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> 32 minutes and 57 seconds. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a deep breath before silently dropping to her knees, unwilling to trust her own voice. </p><p> </p><p>She takes hold of Agatha’s flexed foot, leaning forward until Agatha’s knee is pressed against her chest, their faces almost too close together to pass off as casual. </p><p> </p><p>She hears a low groan make its way through the girl underneath her, a sound Rio has gotten used to hearing everyday in an entirely different context. Her eyes quickly avert to the ceiling, her head tilting back with the subconscious intention of breathing air that isn’t shared with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>As if she could get off that easy.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>God, I don’t know why they hurt so bad.” </em></p><p> </p><p>A lie. They both know why Agatha’s muscles are aching, it’s the same reason Rio’s are.</p><p> </p><p>She refuses the bait as her eyes trace the edges of each ceiling panel, the metaphorical front lines holding strong.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Fuck, I’m so tight right now.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Her voice is breathless but performative at the same time, truth buried under the theatrics she is using to try and rile Rio up. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sends silent prayers up to anyone who will listen, hoping the redness of her face isn’t further encouraging the taunts falling from the pitcher’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand comes to rest against Rio’s shoulder, her touch subtle but intentional, her fingers grabbing at the fabric of her shirt.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Mmm just like that, Captain. It feels so good.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t help the way her gaze immediately snaps down to the other girl’s scrunched face. Her eyes closed, brows furrowed, her lips parted in the shape of a moan. She’s clearly doing this on purpose, seeing how far she can push Rio before the catcher snaps. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> 30 minutes and 14 seconds. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio drops the leg she was holding, switching to the other side.</p><p> </p><p>As she presses forwards with the new limb, Agatha’s grip on her tee tightens, fisting the material and forcing Rio closer. Her breath instinctually catches in her throat, their faces now inches apart.</p><p> </p><p>Obviously, Agatha chooses now to open her eyes, her heavy stare immediately finding Rio’s lips, the action thick with the sickening heat of starvation. It’s hard to believe that Agatha came on Rio’s fingers a mere three hours prior, the desperation painting her features almost convincing enough to fool Rio herself. </p><p> </p><p>The pitcher’s pink tongue pokes out, leaving a thin coating of saliva that Rio is dying to taste. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Why don’t we let these girls out a little early, baby?” </em></p><p> </p><p>A tempting thought but not a great idea. If Lilia finds out, she will definitely make them run around the bases until their lungs explode. </p><p> </p><p>Rio scrapes together every last piece of her restraint, what’s left of her willpower scattered around her brain in fragments, ripped apart by Agatha’s claws days ago.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> 28 minutes and 31 seconds. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She gathers enough strength to shake her head no, a misguided part of her hoping Agatha will understand and let it go. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face falls before the shock is replaced by a disgustingly smug smirk, one that causes a small leak of wetness to coat the inside of Rio's boxers.</p><p> </p><p>She releases Rio’s shirt, trailing the tips of her fingers up the length of the catcher’s neck, stilling right underneath the jut of her chin. With a soft pressure, she guides Rio’s head up in the slightest tilt, forcing her eyes to the mirrored wall in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>A devastating blow. </p><p> </p><p>The sight before her is almost cruel, their positions seemingly reflected for the sole purpose of Rio to feast on. </p><p> </p><p>Her on top, Agatha’s leg still raised in the air, their centers almost completely aligned. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Are you sure?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha draws out each syllable in a hiss, a serpent in the garden tempting and conniving.</p><p> </p><p>Rio has the pleasure of watching her eyes darken in real time, her tanned skin taking on a deeper shade of red as the heat of the moment steals her breath.</p><p> </p><p>An important part of good sportsmanship is knowing when to admit defeat. To tip your hat and politely concede to the better player. After years of tournaments and championship games, Rio recognizes when it is her time to play the gracious loser, to walk off the field with her head held high.</p><p> </p><p>And so she does.</p><p> </p><p>She’s on her feet in an instant, hands clapping to gather everyone’s attention.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay! We are wrapping up early for the day. I’ll see you all tomorrow on the field.”</p><p> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, the girls all break out into giddy smiles, wiping the sweat off of their foreheads and heading back to the locker room. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bumps into her shoulder from the back, stealing a quick slap against Rio’s ass as she passes.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Attagirl.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>On the walk back to their house, the air feels thick and electric, both of them moving at a quick pace, anxious to get back to the privacy of Agatha’s room. </p><p> </p><p>The silence allows for Rio’s ears to pick up the vibrations coming from Agatha’s pocket, her eyes drifting down to the glow emanating through the material of her shorts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha absentmindedly grabs her phone, taking a peak at the screen before declining the call. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ralph Bohner. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio gets a glimpse at the name before the device is shoved back to its origin.</p><p> </p><p>A shiver runs up her spine tamping down the heat that was once overwhelming, a cold bucket of water tossed over Rio’s head. A consequence of not talking about ‘it’, Rio doesn’t know where they actually stand, nor where Agatha stands with Ralph.</p><p> </p><p>It’s easy to avoid thinking about the situation, especially with her now <em> very </em> busy schedule, but the guilt and anxiety are never far. The little voice in the back of her mind whispering its concerns at the end of the night while Agatha’s face rests against her chest. </p><p> </p><p>Every time the conversation even comes close to something real, Agatha flips a switch. She changes the subject, deflects with a joke, or very literally shuts Rio up with her mouth, which has unfortunately been very effective.</p><p> </p><p>A secret, insecure, selfish part of Rio lets her do it. The possibility of Agatha calling it all off, abandoning her at the smallest sign of complexity is a risk that she is not sure she is willing to take. Now that she knows what it’s like to be with her best friend, she doesn’t think she will ever be able to go back, she doesn’t want to. </p><p> </p><p>It would be one thing if it was just sex, but it feels deeper than that. They wake up in the same bed every morning, cook, watch movies, even study together. Rio has never felt so close to someone in her life, the best relationship she has ever had… and it’s with someone else’s girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>She tries to swallow the feelings, return back to the mindless horny bliss she felt a few short seconds ago, but she can’t. Her heart is suddenly twisting in her chest, a restless energy running through her veins.</p><p> </p><p>She takes a deep breath and stares straight ahead. She needs to do this. She will do this.</p><p> </p><p>They will talk about this, even if it kills her.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>The door barely shuts behind them before Agatha is on her.</p><p> </p><p>“God, I thought– that practice– would never end.”</p><p> </p><p>She mutters in between kisses against Rio’s lips, her arms wrapped around the catcher’s neck as she walks them backwards towards the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“I literally fucked you before we left.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is able to get her words out as Agatha’s assault moves to her neck, teeth nibbling on the flesh as she lightly sucks on the skin.</p><p> </p><p>“And? A girl has needs, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>A sharp shove to her shoulder lands her against the mattress, her duvet softening the fall. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha climbs into Rio’s lap, straddling her waist, and leaning down, closing the space between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tries before her own traitorous lungs cut her off with a gasp, the pitcher’s fingers already making their way under the waistband of Rio’s shorts. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, dear?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha answers mindlessly, too invested in the hasty removal of Rio’s clothes. </p><p> </p><p>“I think we should talk.”</p><p> </p><p>That gets her attention.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stills, her body going rigid in Rio’s lap, as her gaze snaps up to meet Rio’s own.</p><p> </p><p>“About?”</p><p> </p><p>A pause. </p><p> </p><p>Their panting breaths the only sound filling the space as Rio tries to gather her thoughts enough to put into words.</p><p> </p><p>She wants this. She wants Agatha. Maybe even too much. But the little voice in the back of her head is screaming at her now. She needs to know what this is before she allows herself to do something incredibly stupid.</p><p> </p><p>“What are we?”</p><p> </p><p>Her own words make her internally cringe, Agatha’s face mirroring a similar level of discomfort.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean… what are we doing here, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well… we were about to fuck…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, trying to hide her smile as she grabs Agatha’s wrists, freeing her hands from their place in Rio’s pants.</p><p> </p><p>“And we still can. I just want to know what this is to you.”</p><p> </p><p>She makes her voice sound as soft as humanly possible, hoping to make Agatha feel comfortable enough to stop deflecting.</p><p> </p><p>Her best friend climbs off of her lap, landing herself on the opposite side of the bed, a suddenly painful amount of space in between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you be a little more specific?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, do you like fucking me?”</p><p> </p><p>“No Rio, I hate it.”</p><p> </p><p>She sarcastically deadpans, unimpressed by the very obvious question Rio chose to interrupt their foreplay with. </p><p> </p><p>“... you gotta give me something here.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what more there is to say? I like you. I like being with you. I like having sex with you. Isn’t that enough?”</p><p> </p><p>“And your boyfriend? How does he feel about all of this?”</p><p> </p><p>A low blow but a necessary one.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks taken aback for a second, as if she forgot she even had one. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that what this is about? Ralph? I don’t know if you have noticed but I haven’t seen the guy in about two weeks. I’ve been a little busy sucking the face off of my very hot catcher.”</p><p> </p><p>She ends her sentence with a little wink and Rio can’t hide the tiny smile pulling at her lips. </p><p> </p><p>“I know,” she forces her face back to neutral territory, “but–”</p><p> </p><p>She’s cut off as Agatha climbs back into her lap, cupping her cheeks with a gentleness she doesn’t normally exhibit in this position. Her eyes flit back and forth between Rio’s own, the humor from before replaced with an aching sincerity.</p><p> </p><p>“I hear you. I really do. I’m still trying to figure things out. When I end it, trust me when I say, my mother will ensure that there will be hell to pay. I just want to enjoy these moments with you, right now. Graduation, the championships… I don’t want this amazing time in our lives to be overshadowed by the wrath of Evanora Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>She pauses to take a deep breath, Rio doesn’t interrupt.</p><p> </p><p>“I– I know it’s a lot to ask… but I swear I will break up with him after graduation.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a vulnerable shake to her voice, her teeth worrying at her bottom lip. Rio’s heart breaks a little in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>She lifts her head off of the pillow, Agatha, getting the message, meets her half way. Their lips brush together softly at first, tentative after a new layer of their relationship has been revealed.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not exactly what Rio wanted to hear but she understands. Agatha is worth the wait.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands move from their spot on the bed, landing on Agatha’s waist, holding her impossibly closer. The kiss deepens, her mouth falling open as Agatha’s does the same. Their tongues make contact and they simultaneously sigh. The familiarity of it makes her chest fill with warmth, her limbs feeling heavy. </p><p> </p><p>This is right where she is meant to be. </p><p> </p><p>The heat continues to escalate, until they are swallowing each other’s pants. Rio’s hips twitch underneath Agatha’s, the urge to buck up into her weight all-consuming. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands drop away from Rio’s face, finding their way back to the elastic band of Rio’s shorts.</p><p> </p><p>An idea crosses her mind. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait– Agatha–”</p><p> </p><p>Their lips disconnect once more, a needy whine coming from the pitcher at the fresh interruption.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, I swear to God–”</p><p> </p><p>“I promise, you’ll like this one.”</p><p> </p><p>A devilish smirk breaks across her face as she lifts Agatha off of her, depositing her softly against the mattress.</p><p> </p><p>“Give me five seconds.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio jumps off of the bed, launching herself down the stairs, back to her own room. </p><p> </p><p>She is too excited to even think about knocking, busting through the door like a bullet shot from a canon.</p><p> </p><p>“RIO?!”</p><p> </p><p>Alice shoots off of the bed, quickly pulling her shirt back down.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God! Have you ever heard of a lock?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands quickly cover her eyes, her palms resting against the heat of her flushed cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I’m sorry. I didn’t think I still had a roommate! You can look now by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>When she finally re-opens her eyes, her gaze lands on the two girls sitting upright in the twin bed, their faces a similar crimson to Rio’s own. </p><p> </p><p>Jen stands up, planting a quick kiss on Alice’s cheek, “Text me later?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice gives a sheepish nod as Jen makes her way to the door, her fingertips brushing against the spot the other girl’s lips touched.</p><p> </p><p>Rio steps out of her way, awkwardly avoiding eye contact until the door closes behind her. </p><p> </p><p>“Soo, that’s still going on?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh yeah, you would know if you weren’t shoved so far up Agatha’s–”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, okay! I get it!”</p><p> </p><p>The two girls stare at each other before erupting in a fit of giggles.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess we have both been a little busy.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice sighs as her hand rubs against the back of her neck, a shy smile curving her lips. Rio misses her roommate, and would love to catch up, but she is on a time limit after all.</p><p> </p><p>“We should get lunch tomorrow, my treat!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio says, while grabbing a certain backpack from her closet, trying to be as nonchalant as possible.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I would like tha– RIO VIDAL! You are not grabbing what I think you are right now!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry! I’ll see you tomorrow!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio calls over her shoulder as she sprints back upstairs, trying to avoid any more embarrassment.</p><p> </p><p>“We are talking about this at lunch!”</p><p> </p><p>Alice makes sure Rio hears before she’s out of ear shot.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally bursts back through Agatha’s door, she drops the bag on the floor before folding in half, resting her hands on her knees as she tries to catch her breath. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, that was definitely longer than five seconds.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice forces her head up, the pitcher laying on her bed, scrolling languidly on her phone, now completely naked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t help but chuckle. She is going to ruin this girl.</p><p> </p><p>“I was just grabbing my tool box, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at that, her gaze skipping over Rio to land on the backpack between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? A present for me? You really shouldn’t have.”</p><p> </p><p>She is trying to joke but Rio can hear the very real curiosity in her voice, her eyes pinned to the black bag on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Rio decides to show and not tell, grabbing the backpack as she makes her way to the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Now, you can absolutely say no–”</p><p> </p><p>“Open the bag, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha mindlessly licks her lips as Rio pulls down the zipper, the folds making way to reveal her green 6.5’ inch strap and accompanying harness.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you had that this whole time?!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio responds with a tiny nod, suddenly feeling bashful under Agatha’s scrutinizing gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know how you’d feel about it–”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, put the dick on.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes ma’am.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around, quickly undressing herself before fitting the base of the strap into the O-ring.</p><p> </p><p>A small part of her is worried Agatha will think she looks ridiculous with the silicone hanging between her legs. That concern is quickly silenced as she finally looks back at her, her best friend’s gaze glued to her new appendage, pupils expanded to cover the blues of her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, you’re really big.”</p><p> </p><p>It falls from Agatha’s mouth in a whisper, like she didn’t even mean to say it out loud. Rio hears it all the same, the knot in her lower belly pulling tighter by the second.</p><p> </p><p>“Come here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio follows the command seamlessly, climbing on top of her until she is comfortably situated between her thighs, her strap rubbing frictionlessly through Agatha’s glistening folds. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Fuck, that feels good.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>The pitcher’s hands make their way to the back of Rio’s hair, pulling her back down into a searing kiss. Rio’s hips immediately start moving, rutting herself against the harness, coating her dick in Agatha’s slick, as she accepts her tongue in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>The noises coming from the two of them are nothing short of sinful, deep groans harmonizing with needy whimpers, Rio’s head is starting to spin. She needs to be inside of her right fucking now.</p><p> </p><p>She breaks the kiss first, leaning back until she can see where the two of them meet.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to stretch you first?”</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t that what you have been doing for the past two weeks? I think I can take it.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a determined glint in her eye and a smug smirk on her face. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Well, if the lady insists… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes hold of the base, lining herself up with Agatha’s entrance, nudging the head in just enough for Agatha to feel the size of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Last chance to back out.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio offers, knowing Agatha would never take the easy way out.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ, Rio. Who knew a big dick came with such a massive fucking ego<em>oo– fuck” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio cuts her off by pushing in a few inches, the wetness between Agatha’s thighs eradicating the need for lube. Her eyes slam shut, her face scrunching at the stretch.</p><p> </p><p>“What were you saying, honey? Something about how <em> massive </em> I was?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickers to herself, proud she finally cut the other woman off for once. She sinks another inch in, almost completely bottomed out.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You’re f-fucking insufferable.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha grits out, her voice strained as she clearly works to accommodate Rio’s length.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, if you really feel that way…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio starts as she draws her hips back, pretending she is about to pull out completely.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Wait, wait, fuck– I’m sorry baby, please stay in.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Now, was that so hard?”</p><p> </p><p>She brings her hips forward again with a hard thrust, filling the other girl completely. The moan that rips its way out of Agatha’s chest is loud and obscene, her fingers scratching at Rio’s back as she tries to find purchase.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>A-Again, Rio, f-fuck– Do it again” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio loyally draws her hips back once more before swinging them forward, the sound of their thighs slapping sending another wave of arousal through her nervous system, the harness beneath her certainly drenched with it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha must feel the same, nonverbally communicating her want with rapid head nods and whimpers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s pace picks up, the bed frame banging against the wall, Agatha’s nails leaving claw marks down her back, the base of the strap rubbing against her own clit perfectly. Her head dips down to the space under her pitcher’s ear, teeth scraping down a straining tendon, the urge to latch on making her feel like a wild animal</p><p> </p><p>She shows some self restraint, choosing instead to nibble on the taut muscle, Agatha’s head tilting further back to offer more access. They wordlessly agreed to avoid leaving visible marks, especially on Agatha, but all Rio wants to do is claim this perfect woman. Leave an impossible to ignore bruise in the shape of her mouth for all to see, her signature on the most beautiful canvas. </p><p> </p><p>She gives a teasing suck before leaning back onto her knees, separating herself from the temptation. The angle change prompts a small sob to fall from Agatha’s lips. Rio lays her hand flat on Agatha’s lower abdomen, feeling the strap rub fervently against her front wall. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>You feel fucking perfect.” </em></p><p> </p><p>The praise begins to fall from Rio without her even realizing it, her limbs beginning to tingle as her hips work harder, chasing her own orgasm.</p><p><br/>“<em>There you go pretty girl, just like that.”</em></p><p> </p><p>The hand that was resting on her belly moves down, landing amongst her curls, her thumb parting her folds to find her clit. Agatha’s arousal and Rio’s thrusts do the rest of the work, her thumb moving up and down against the swollen nub in time with her pace.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s back immediately arches at the contact, her hands curling into the pillow behind her, eyes rolled into the back of her head. The sight is divine, unlike anything humankind has ever seen before. A powerful Goddess corrupted by Rio’s own calloused hands, a glorious day. </p><p> </p><p>She’s pulled out of her reverie when she feels <em> it, </em>a hot gush of Agatha’s arousal soaking their bottom halves, Rio’s own orgasm immediately knocking the wind from her lungs at the sensation. Her hips stutter as she falls forward, bringing her face inches from Agatha’s, teary blue meeting glassy brown.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I love her. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The thought comes through Rio’s head unprompted, a horrifically timed epiphany. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She shoves the thought deep down, hoping to examine it when she is not actively inside<em> the girl she is in love with– </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> Double fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She pulls herself out slowly as Agatha lets out a tiny whine of protest, rolling herself onto her back while actively working to catch her breath. </p><p> </p><p>“Give me five minutes. I think my soul needs to re-enter my body.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t help but let out a breathless chuckle, her heart still racing from their activity and her orgasmic revelation.</p><p> </p><p>“No need, Captain. I already finished.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifts her arm, inviting Agatha to snuggle into her chest, which she happily accepts. Her nose brushes against the catcher’s neck, goosebumps erupting under the heat of her breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I hope you atleast pulled out on time. I’m too young to be a mother.”</p><p> </p><p>She adorably giggles at her own joke, butterflies and sunshine erupting all over Rio’s body at the sound.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She is so fucked. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She playfully slaps Rio’s chest, “Okay, big guy, what position you wanna try now?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Down on one knee? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> — </em>
</p><p> </p><p>By the time the sun goes down, the two of them are sweaty and spent, the sheets covered in an overwhelming mix of their fluids and lube. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth is dry, her limbs exhausted, Agatha laying on top of her completely limp. </p><p> </p><p>“Baby, let me up. I’m going to get us some water.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whines in acknowledgement but remains motionless, her hair draping over her face like a curtain. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Let me take care of you.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wordlessly answers by finally rolling off of Rio, landing in a heap of trembling limbs. </p><p> </p><p>Rio swings her legs over the side of the bed, forcing herself into an upright position. She takes off the harness, tossing it into her bag to be cleaned when she can properly walk again. She grabs her clothes off of the floor, dressing enough to enter the kitchen without flashing anyone.</p><p> </p><p>“Why don’t you get the shower going, and I’ll meet you in there?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply grunts, eyes still closed. Rio will take that as a ‘maybe’. </p><p> </p><p>She closes the door behind her as she heads downstairs, taking each step manually to ensure her safety on her shaky legs.</p><p> </p><p>When she arrives at her destination, she grabs two big cups, filling them to the brim with the filtered water from their Britta. She feels some of her strength return when the icy fresh liquid enters her system, her body stabilizing at the feeling. </p><p> </p><p>She replaces what she took from the glass, and heads towards the stairs, before a knock at the door stops her in her tracks. </p><p> </p><p>She sighs, placing the glasses on a nearby table, as she peeks through the front window.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ralph fucking Bohner. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes an instinctual step back, dread and guilt making a dangerous cocktail in her weak stomach. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio? Is that you?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fucking fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Can you let me in? I need to talk to Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>She swallows the horror of this situation as she opens the door, standing face to face with the man whose girlfriend she just pounded into the mattress for the past two and a half hours. </p><p> </p><p>His eyes trail a shameless path down her body, which is still covered in Agatha’s drying cum.</p><p> </p><p>His lips pull upward in what he probably thinks is a sly smile. A shiver makes its way up Rio’s spine, the dread mixing with a gut-wrenching disgust.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re looking hotter than usual.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stands there rendered silent, her mind suddenly blank.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyway, I need to talk to Agatha. There were some problems with the deposit we put down on our apartment.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Deposit? Apartment? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brain turns the words over in her head, repeating them rapidly until they accidentally tumble out of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Deposit? Apartment?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes? Like the ones people live in? We’ve been looking for a place to move into after graduation. I’m surprised she didn’t show you, the place is awesome–”</p><p> </p><p>His words cut out as the sound of blood rushing begins to fill her ears. He pulls out his phone, turning the screen to display images of the modest two bed, one bath. </p><p> </p><p>Her hand falls from the doorknob as she takes a step back, tears beginning to blur her vision.</p><p> </p><p>“Y-Yeah, she’s upstairs getting ready for a shower.”</p><p> </p><p>Ralph gives her a smile as he pushes past her, heading towards Agatha’s room. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio calls to him, stopping him in place.</p><p> </p><p>“Take this water up to her for me?”</p><p> </p><p>He grabs the cup from her hands with a quick nod, mindlessly stepping over the shattered pieces of Rio’s heart.</p><p> </p><p>She watches him go, tracking the path that was supposed to be Rio’s. </p><p> </p><p>Her cup sits there alone.</p><p> </p>

<p> </p><p>Agatha feels<em> amazing.  </em></p><p> </p><p>The steaming hot water is beating against the skin of her back, the muscles there pulled tight with the combination of playoff training and weeks of Rio’s perfectly rough touch.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in as long as she can remember, Agatha feels at peace. </p><p> </p><p>Her mind and body, in perfect harmony. </p><p> </p><p>She is one game away from the championships, about to graduate college with the highest fucking honors.

</p><p> </p><p>Is this how everyone feels when they find their person?  She never wants it to stop.

</p><p> </p><p>The sound of her bedroom door opening and closing pulls her from her thoughts, Rio returning with their waters. An impossible warmth fills her chest at the thought of the arrival of the other woman, already craving the catcher’s arms wrapping around her under the stream. Could life get any better than a pretty girl joining her in this blissfully scalding shower?</p><p> </p><p>Oddly enough, the bathroom door never opens, Rio never comes.</p><p> </p><p>An uncomfortable feeling starts growing in her gut. Rio would never miss an opportunity to see her naked… something is wrong.</p><p> </p><p>She quickly washes the rest of her conditioner out of her hair, her fingers still trembling from the strain she has been putting on her body. She turns off the water and grabs a towel, ignoring the rest of her hair routine in favor of heading straight back into her room, anxious to see why Rio didn’t join her.</p><p> </p><p>When she opens the bathroom door, she is startled by the sight of a man sitting on her bed, the sheets still rumpled from when Agatha crawled out of them twenty minutes prior.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ralph fucking Bohner? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her boyfriend lifts his gaze at the sound of her arrival, his eyes quickly bulging out of his head at the sight of her wet, partially covered body. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, hello there, gorgeous.”</p><p> </p><p>Her arms immediately wrap tighter around her chest, disgust and confusion making her blood simmer underneath her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p> </p><p>The words tumble out like an accusation, as if a stranger has barged into her room. Even just the sight of him sitting on her mattress fills her with an overwhelming sense of dread. Her sanctuary, her space, her fucking bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Well you weren’t answering your phone, so I figured I’d be a good boyfriend and surprise you instead.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha says nothing, still reeling from his unexpected presence. So he continues, standing up and slowly approaching her, as if he is wary of scaring her off.</p><p> </p><p>“I know you have been busy lately, but I miss you baby.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Baby?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her chest tightens in revolt at the pet name, her body only willing to accept the title when it is coming from her catcher’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean to scare you. Rio let me in… I thought you’d be happy to see me.”</p><p> </p><p>Everything suddenly stills, her heart pounding in her ears. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> He saw her? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>She replies thoughtlessly, her brain zeroed in on the name that has been consuming her every waking thought.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes…? You girls are acting so weird today.”, he is standing in front of her now, his hands resting lightly on her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“First she acts like she doesn’t know about the apartment, then you don't even give me a kiss after two weeks of not seeing me? What is going on Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Apartment? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Before she can even begin to think of a response, the shock and information overload making her brain buffer painfully, Ralph is already leaning in. His lips press against hers, the feeling familiarly empty. </p><p> </p><p>She moves to pull away but his mouth chases her, attempting to deepen the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>The creak of the door pulls both of their attention, his face still close enough to feel the heat of his breath.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Well, there she is. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio stands there in the same clothes she was wearing when she left, eyes wide as she takes in their proximity.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes past Ralph carelessly, nudging his shoulder with enough force that he has to take a step back to steady himself.</p><p> </p><p>“I forgot my phone.”</p><p> </p><p>She avoids Agatha’s eye as she makes her way through the room, grabbing the device off of the night stand near her bed. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio–</em>”</p><p> </p><p>She tries again, hoping to find a way to convey the situation while leaving their audience in the dark. </p><p> </p><p>Like a soldier following orders, Rio’s gaze remains singular, her movements as concise as possible. Before Agatha even knows it, she is already heading back out the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ, can you just wait a fucking second?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s arm reaches out, getting a solid grip on Rio’s bicep, forcing the catcher to stop her march and <em> finally </em>look at her.</p><p> </p><p>She regrets it immediately.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes meet and Agatha sees it all. The pain, the hurt, the betrayal. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes are swollen with brimming tears, seconds from streaming down her face. Her cheeks are red, her brows furrowed, her bottom lip trembling. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t have to ask Agatha to let her go. </p><p> </p><p>Her fingers loosen around the muscle, her hand drops and Rio leaves without a word, slamming the door shut behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stares at the dark wood, willing time to reverse. </p><p> </p><p>Large, unwelcome hands make their way onto her bare shoulders, an unsettling chuckle in her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Is everyone in this house on their periods or something?”</p><p> </p><p>She ignores that comment before she does something that will land her in the local news.</p><p> </p><p>“I need to get dressed.”</p><p> </p><p>She pulls out of his grip, gathering her pajamas and making her way back into the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What the fuck just happened? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She locks the door, dropping her clothes in a pile on the tiled floor. She sighs as her hands rise to her face, her eyes squeezed shut while her palms comfortingly cup the flesh of her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Deep breaths. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Okay, that's not fucking helping.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She tries to process everything that just happened, but all she can see is Rio’s devastated face. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Hey babe, where's your computer? The realtor sent over a link to help us fix the problem with the deposit.”</p><p> </p><p>There is shuffling coming from outside the door, Ralph looking through her things to try and find her laptop. </p><p> </p><p>Right, and there’s that.</p><p> </p><p>What fucking apartment? </p><p> </p><p>Sure, they had talked about getting a place after graduation but they never actually did any searching, at least Agatha never did. Since when is there a realtor? Since when is there a deposit?</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, the muffled noises of rifling cease, a suspicious silence filling the air. Agatha’s instincts tell her that that is not a good sign. She shakes out her limbs and quickly puts on her new pajamas; she can’t avoid him forever after all. </p><p> </p><p>When she re-emerges, Ralph is standing stock still, his back facing her. He is holding a familiar black backpack in his hands, staring into the open pouch.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuuuuuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She moves quickly, long strides across the room until she can rip the bag from his hands, her cheeks tinted a bright pink. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that… what I think it is?”</p><p> </p><p>She zips the bag up tight, flinging it under her bed, doing her best to avoid his gaze. </p><p> </p><p>“I have no idea what you’re referring to.”</p><p> </p><p>A weak attempt, Ralph may be stupid but he is definitely not that stupid. A smug smirk creeps onto his face, his eyes gleaming with mischief.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw it’s okay babe, you don’t have to be embarrassed. I’m excited for the wedding night too.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Jesus Christ. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She needs this man out of her room immediately. She needs to think, she needs to talk to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you for… stopping by. This has been wonderful, truly, but I can’t do this apartment stuff right now. I had a tiring… practice today and I just need to go to bed. Can we talk tomorrow?”</p><p> </p><p>He closes the distance between them, a new air of confidence in every step. He grabs her chin, tilting her head so that she is forced to look up at him.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, baby.”, he leans in, planting another devastatingly numb kiss on her lips. She stands completely still, hoping he can’t sense the guilt and disgust that is raging a storm inside of her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“Try not to think of me too much, don’t want you to make yourself loose using your new toy.”</p><p> </p><p>He shoots her a wink before taking a step back, proud of his words.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> This was supposed to be her future? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She closes her eyes, unable to look at him anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll text you tomorrow, Ralph.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I’ll be waiting by the phone, hot stuff!”</p><p> </p><p>She hears the door open and close, his steps echoing down the stairwell as he finally leaves her vicinity. </p><p> </p><p>The room exhales with her, what feels like her first full breath in hours.</p><p> </p><p>Before she can think or do anything else, she instinctually searches for her phone. She doesn’t know how to fix this. Rio probably does not want to see her right now, which unfortunately makes a lot of sense. She is not stupid enough to bang down her door, but she has to try something.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
</p><p>
<em> He is gone now if you want to come up and talk? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Of course she doesn’t want to come up and talk. Fucking stupid.</p><p> </p><p>She erases the message and tries again.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
</p><p>
<em> I know this looks bad, but I swear I can explain. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Desperate, to say the least. She looks like a liar. </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
</p><p>
<em> I’m sorry. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That sounds like a goodbye.</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>Who thought inventing texting was a good idea? Why can’t she just write a letter and have a pigeon deliver it two windows down?</p><p> </p><p>Wait, should she write a letter? Is that a good idea or is she fucking crazy?</p><p> </p><p>What would she even say? </p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘I feel terrible that my boyfriend showed up and ruined the moment. I technically knew about the potential of an apartment but I haven’t thought about it since the first time we kissed.’  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Maybe don’t bring up Ralph.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘I guess I kind of hate most things. But I never really seem to hate you. So I want to spend the rest of my life with you, is that cool?’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Way too soon for that.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘I’m sorry. I love yo–’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, no. She is fucking crazy.</p><p> </p><p>Back to iMessage.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha:</b>
</p><p>
<em> Hey  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It’s the only message she has written that she can’t pick apart. Short, simple, an invitation. </p><p> </p><p>She sends it, knowing Rio probably won’t respond. If the tables were reversed, she would have already been blocked by now. Luckily for her, Rio isn’t like that. She may run but she would never hide. Between the two of them, Agatha has always been the coward. </p><p> </p><p>First to throw a punch, last to apologize. </p><p> </p><p>She lays down in her bed, unwilling to change the still slightly damp sheets. It feels only fair that she lies in the mess she made. </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>When morning comes, her eyes blink open, her throat drier than sandpaper. Dehydrated, disoriented, and, for the first time in two weeks, alone. </p><p> </p><p>She blindly searches her night stand, reaching for a possibly abandoned bottle, her eyes still crusted shut with sleep. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, her fingers hit glass. A cup filled to the top with room temperature water. </p><p> </p><p>She gratefully gulps down the miraculous find, no doubt a gift from her guardian angel. </p><p> </p><p>She rolls out of bed, stumbling to the bathroom on sore legs. Her hair is a mess. Frizzy and wild. She remembers skipping her hair routine after her shower. She remembers it all.</p><p> </p><p>The realization sends her flying back to her bed, tossing the blankets to find her phone. The screen illuminates, showing the time, 8:08am, and a new email from Outlook. No new text messages. No response from Rio. </p><p> </p><p>She’s not surprised but it aches all the same. </p><p> </p><p>She throws her phone on the charger and heads back to the bathroom, trying to tame her locks with her comb. She brushes her teeth and splashes cold water in her face. </p><p> </p><p>Once she is sure she is at the very least presentable, she heads downstairs. She has to find Rio, she has to at least try.</p><p> </p><p>When she arrives at Rio’s room, the door is closed. A mirror of the morning after their first kiss, another walk of shame, a different plea sitting on the tip of her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>She knocks and waits. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a shuffle and the door opens, Alice standing on the other side expectantly, almost like she was waiting for her arrival.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s not here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, where is she then?”</p><p> </p><p>There’s no pretense. They both know who she is looking for. </p><p> </p><p>“She doesn’t want to see you right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alice–”</p><p> </p><p>“Haven’t you taken enough?”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t understand–”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I do, actually. Did you have fun? Get it out of your system? Everyone experiments in college, most people have the decency to not do it with their best friend. If you care about her at all, you will leave her alone. Don’t text her, don’t come back to this door. I won’t be so nice next time.”</p><p> </p><p>The look in Alice’s eye is fierce, despite the inches of height Agatha has on her. A knight clad in pajamas rather than a suit of armor, but a protector all the same. </p><p> </p><p>The door slams in her face, her resolve falters.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe… Alice is right? Maybe if she really did care about Rio she wouldn’t be dragging her into this mess. She wouldn’t be hiding her, she wouldn’t be chasing her. She wouldn’t have kissed her in the first place. </p><p> </p><p>She knows this isn’t an experiment, on the contrary, this is the closest to alive Agatha has ever felt. But, that doesn’t mean it’s not selfish, wanting something she can’t have, offering Rio something she’s not sure she can give.</p><p> </p><p>The plan was to deal with it after graduation but what was she even going to do? Her and Ralph break up and then what? Her mother stops talking to her forever, she has nowhere to go, the version of her life she has spent years realizing vanishes in the blink of an eye?</p><p> </p><p>Everything she has worked for, all of the times she gritted her teeth and smiled, it was all for nothing?</p><p> </p><p>The life she would have had with Ralph would have been just fine. Boring, predictable, but easy and expected. Get married, buy a house, go to church, pop out a few kids, hate your husband– The American Dream. She wasn’t excited about it but she was content, her peace had already been made years ago. She never would have longed for something more, she would have never even considered that there could be another option.</p><p> </p><p>After taking that first bite of the forbidden fruit, akin to Eve in the Garden of Eden, she knows she can never truly go back. The previous innocuous lack of love between them has already begun to twist from a numb indifference to a bitter ache. She will always know the truth about herself, about what she wants, who she needs. Every touch will be compared to <em> hers </em> , the moments they stole with each other will play on a constant loop in Agatha’s mind every night, as she lays awake in bed next to <em> him</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The idea of settling for a life of noxious mediocrity, being nothing more than<em> Mrs. Bohner, </em>makes her feel sick to her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>She wraps her arms around herself as she stares blankly at the wood of Rio and Alice’s door, the house around her still in a state of eerie morning silence. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha makes her journey back up to her room, each step feeling like its own little surrender. </p><p> </p><p>Her phone sits atop her messy blankets, still attached to the wall by its wire. </p><p> </p><p>One last try couldn’t hurt? Maybe if she can just explain, Rio can decide for herself if what they have is worth all of this fucking pain. Alice told her not to text but she never said she couldn’t call.</p><p> </p><p>As she reaches for the device, it begins to vibrate, one already coming in.</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>Mother</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>At the sight of the name illuminating her screen, her heart drops an inch in her chest, her blood runs cold. It’s like her nervous system has suddenly kicked into hyperdrive, her body reacting as if Evanora had just busted through the door with a chainsaw instead of calling Agatha’s number. </p><p> </p><p>Her hands shake as her finger slides across the screen, already familiar with the consequences of letting her mother go to voicemail.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Agatha? It’s so good to see you’re alive, not like you ever call me or anything.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Her volume is level but Agatha can sense the contempt behind her words, a tone she knows well after so many years of living under the same roof.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, mother, I have just been busy lately.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice is small, the way it always sounds when she talks to her.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Well, I have been doing good, thank you for asking. I was just calling to let you know that the deposit issue has been settled, I just got off the phone with the bank.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Wait, you know about the apartment?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Well, yes. Who do you think put down your half of the deposit? You’re welcome by the way, ungrateful child.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Why would you–”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Because I knew if it was up to you, it would never get done. Trust me, you will be thanking me for having one less thing to worry about when you are planning your wedding.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha begins to chew on her nails, a nervous habit she developed as a child, one she hadn’t indulged in years.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>He already has your ring picked out so it won’t be long now. If everything goes to plan, you’ll have the engagement by summer and be married by spring, the perfect wedding season.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Her throat constricts further, the task of taking full breaths becoming a mental effort. </p><p> </p><p>Her fight or flight instincts are already in full swing, a sudden surge of adrenaline giving her enough stupid courage to utter her next words. </p><p> </p><p>“Mother, I-I’m not sure I am ready to get married right now…”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a start.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Agatha… You know how I despise humor.” </em></p><p> </p><p>She strains to swallow around the lump in her throat, the stability of her thumbnail cracking at the assault led by her front teeth. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe this time will be different?</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not joking mother, I-I am serious.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a long, uncomfortable pause, the air in her room falling still.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You’re not sure if you are ready to get married right now?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Evanora repeats the words back to her, tasting them in her own mouth. Agatha’s blood begins to trickle, the skin around her fingernail finally tearing free.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Listen closely, because I am only going to say this once, child. I gave you a gift by allowing you to leave for college to continue your useless softball career. I let you have your fun. I drove you to every God-damned practice, funded your pitching lessons, I even paid for the room you are probably lazing in right now–” </em></p><p> </p><p>Evanora’s voice booms through her speaker, words so familiar Agatha could probably recite them herself.</p><p> </p><p><em> “That boy has been patient. Miraculously waiting for you to give up on this nonsense for the past five years. What he sees in you, God forgive me, I will never understand. And now, after everything we have done for you, you dare throw it back in our faces? </em> <b> <em>You have the nerve to ask for more time?”</em> </b></p><p> </p><p>Her next victim enters the killing floor, the edges of her index nail already beginning to fray.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Do you want to be alone? Is that it? You don’t want a family or a husband? Are you really so selfish that you can’t see the suffering you will cause? How can you be so willing to make everyone around you miserable? And, for what? To punish me?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her mother lets out a pained sigh as the tip of her nail peels free, the satisfying sting of it keeping her grounded.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I don’t want to fight with you anymore, Agatha. Do you think I enjoy this? I long for the day that I can stop yelling at you and finally just be proud.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That one hurt a little more than the others.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I know for a fact that I am the only person who cares for you enough to tell you this. I fear there is something broken within you. I have prayed on it for years but now I am certain. You take and take and take until everyone around you is left empty. You need to marry this boy before he realizes the leech you are, if you haven’t already left him a hollow husk.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Silence crackles over the line, the flesh of her fingers throbbing red.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “The wedding is happening, Agatha. If you could look past yourself for five seconds you will realize that you owe me this much.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The call abruptly ends, a common fate of their conversations. Her screen falls dark, the void of it reflecting back her blank face.</p><p> </p><p>She watches her eyes crinkle, her vision slowly beginning to blur behind a fresh set of tears. For the first time in four years, Agatha begins to cry. The tears fall torrentially, the sobs wracking her body as she curls into the soft cotton of her rumpled sheets, Rio’s scent still trapped in the fabric. </p><p> </p><p>She has never felt so hopeless, so desperate, so truly alone. </p><p> </p><p>Even when she was still living in her mother’s house, she always had something to look forward to. The idea of leaving it all behind, going to college, moving into her own place– the promise of overwhelming freedom to keep her going.</p><p> </p><p>Now? She has nothing. The path of her life forged by someone else’s will, the expectations and the guilt of not fulfilling them equally suffocating, smothered into submission by her own mother’s love.</p><p> </p><p>She lays there for what must be hours, watching the sun drop further and further in the sky. Her lips feel dry, her stomach rumbles, and yet she stays. The walls of her room simultaneously playing the familiar role of comfort and cage. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Her sanctuary, her space, her fucking bed. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>When the time to head to practice comes around her face is dry, her body laying heavy with exhaustion. She feels weak, every simple movement an almost insurmountable task.</p><p> </p><p>Under normal circumstances, Agatha would recognize that she is currently unfit to play softball. She would feign sick and call out, an excuse she has only used in the most dire of circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>But today? She needs to see Rio, no matter the cost. Even if they fight, even if Rio can’t look at her. She knows where her best friend will be, so that's where she will go.</p><p> </p><p>She mentally counts down before using the last of her strength to sit up, swinging her legs over the side of the bed. She makes her way to her dresser, to grab her practice uniform. She squeezes into her sliding shorts, rolls her socks up her shins, and drags the legs of her softball pants to her waist. She looks in the mirror and flinches, empty blue eyes staring back at her.</p><p> </p><p>Her face is still puffy, her freckled cheeks still hot to the touch, her hair frizzy and matted. She doesn’t have the energy to hide it. Instead, she twists the knotted mess into the shape of a bun before grabbing a protein bar and chugging a gatorade, the last thing she needs is to pass out in front of the whole team.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>When she arrives at practice, Rio is already there, deep in conversation with Lilia. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha strains her ears as she stretches, trying to catch fragments but the sound of her teammates getting ready around her is just too loud. </p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes, Rio turns and walks away, her eyes trained straight ahead, avoiding Agatha’s gaze.</p><p> </p><p>She was about to go after her, consequences be damned, but a voice calls her name.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha? Come here for a second.” </p><p> </p><p>She waits until Rio’s figure fades from view before heading towards her Coach.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio is going to be out for the next few days, you’re going to be pitching to Carol.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Why?” </p><p> </p><p>She says it too quickly, the desperation in her voice palpable to anyone listening. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s in pain, kid.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s blood freezes in her veins. Did Rio tell her? Does she know it’s Agatha’s fault? </p><p> </p><p>“I know I messed up but–”</p><p> </p><p>She starts her explanation but is cut off when Lilia raises her hand, effectively silencing her.</p><p> </p><p>“She pulled a muscle in her thigh, Agatha. She’s just going to spend some time with the athletic trainer and she will be back on her feet soon. Did something else happen that I should be aware of?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh. That makes sense. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was so overcome with her guilty conscience, she didn’t even take a second to consider a different explanation. The Catholic girl inside of her itching to confess her sins. </p><p> </p><p>“No, no, uh, nothing else. We were practicing the other day… and I thought I might have hurt her. She seemed a little sore afterwards. I’m glad she is getting checked out.”</p><p> </p><p>God, even in her imagination she is the bad guy. What else is new?</p><p> </p><p>This is what she gets for trying to make everyone happy. </p><p> </p><p>Realistically, she knows this was always the outcome. Rio hating her, Ralph’s resentment, her mother’s disappointment. </p><p> </p><p>“Carol?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia calls out to the golden retriever in the shape of a catcher. Carol comes bounding over dressed in her clunky gear, excitement coloring her facial features.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio is hurt right now,” Agatha tries not to flinch at the words, “you are going to be catching with Agatha until she is able to make a full return.”</p><p> </p><p>A big smile breaks out across her face, as a sour taste infiltrates Agatha’s mouth, the reality of not playing with Rio almost knocking her off of her feet. </p><p> </p><p>Why did she even come to this practice? What did she think was going to happen? Rio would act like nothing went wrong? Like last night never happened? </p><p> </p><p>Lilia walks away, leaving the two girls space to warm up in the corner of right field. </p><p> </p><p>“Where do you want me, Captain?”</p><p> </p><p>The title rolls off of her tongue like an afterthought, an accidental twist of the knife that is buried deep in her ribcage. </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>Two days of silence passed. No texts, no accidental sightings, no Rio. </p><p> </p><p>It’s like she vanished off of the face of the earth, the only evidence of her existence being the empty space in Agatha’s bed and the achingly vacant hole in her heart where the muscle had been stretched to accommodate her.</p><p> </p><p>She could barely sleep, barely eat, barely make it through a few hours without tears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has never cried so much in her life. How she hasn’t yet collapsed from exhaustion is a mystery worth being reviewed in acclaimed medical journals. </p><p> </p><p>Another pitch leaves her fingertips as she mindlessly warms up for their next game, the rhythmic motions of her routine muscle memory at this point. The purple bags under her eyes matching the accents of the uniform clinging uncomfortably to her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Carol gave up trying to converse with her fairly early into their partnership, her once ecstatic demeanor replaced with a reluctant silence, an acceptance.</p><p> </p><p>A sudden pull draws her eyes to the dugout, her instincts making her aware of a shift. </p><p> </p><p>Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Her catcher makes her way into the fenced off area, wearing black sweatpants paired with her jersey. She looks almost as tired as Agatha feels, her shoulders slumped, her face unusually pale despite her naturally tan skin.</p><p> </p><p>The ball zips past Agatha’s face, immediately grabbing her attention as it smacks against the cage behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“Woah! I’m so sorry! Are you okay? I thought you were looking.”</p><p> </p><p>Carol is on her feet immediately, already walking towards Agatha’s hollow frame. </p><p> </p><p>She instinctually puts her hands up, trying to stop the attempt at comfort before Carol gets too close.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I’m fine. Just go back to your spot.”</p><p> </p><p>The look on her face must be telling a different story because Carol’s steps don’t falter until she is standing right in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“I should have looked before throwing it back, I’m such an ass.”</p><p> </p><p>Her hand hesitantly reaches out, landing on Agatha’s forearm.</p><p> </p><p>“You promise you’re okay? You look a little shaken… we can call it if you want? I think you’re all set anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Despite the proximity to Carol, Agatha’s gaze can’t help but look over her shoulder, her body craving another glimpse of Rio’s. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately for everyone, her eyes land on not one player but two. </p><p> </p><p>There’s that feeling again. </p><p> </p><p>That overpowering, blood curling, gut wrenching rage. </p><p> </p><p>Cass is standing next to Rio, her smile radiant, at whatever the fuck Rio just said to her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help the way her body springs into action as Cass throws her head back laughing, her shoulder playfully nudging Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Actually, I think you’re right. Let’s head back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t even spare the blonde a glance, her focus pointed at the girl touching her catcher, her cleats ripping fragments of grass from the ground with the force of each step.</p><p> </p><p>She clears her throat as she re-enters the dugout, the conversation between the two girls coming to an immediate stop.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio! Oh my, it’s so great to see you! How are you feeling? Can I talk to you for a minute?”</p><p> </p><p>She forces the corners of her mouth to lift into something she hopes resembles a polite smile. </p><p> </p><p>Her catcher doesn’t even bother looking away from the girl in between them, attempting to play indifference. Agatha sees through it of course, one of the perks of Rio living rent free in her head, she knows her body like the back of her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m okay here actually. I think the game is about to start–”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Now, Rio</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Both girls whip their head around at the sudden shift in Agatha’s tone, her patience worn too thin to hide the urgency in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks right at her, for the first time since that night. Her soft brown eyes tired but finally on her again. Before she can revel in the feeling, Rio gestures with her arms, indicating for Agatha to lead the way. She moves quickly, her feet carrying them to a more secluded spot at the edge of the trees surrounding the field.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck was that?”</p><p> </p><p>The words hiss out of Rio’s mouth the second they are out of earshot, her back still turned to the catcher. She doesn’t need to look at her right now, she already knows what she will find.</p><p> </p><p>“What was what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha acts clueless, but they both know she is smarter than that.</p><p> </p><p>“You stomped in there like you were ready to rip someone’s head off.”</p><p> </p><p>Her rage is almost blinding. Logistically, she can acknowledge that she has no claim to Rio, she never really did, but if she doesn’t say something she might explode, her guts and brains coloring the clay of the field a deep red. So for the sake of the people at home, she powers through this embarrassing display of irrational emotions. At least Rio is talking to her again.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry. Were you two having an important conversation?”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I don’t know what you want from me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice sounds tired and gentle, the tremble in it forcing Agatha to finally turn around. </p><p> </p><p>The pure agony that is on her face steals the breath from Agatha’s lungs. It is almost enough to stop her from unleashing the meltdown she can already feel building up.  </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Almost.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I want you to not flirt with other girls in front of me.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s not fair but she can’t stop, the dam of emotions violently bursting from her every seam.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t flirting with anyone! Cass and I were just talking.”</p><p> </p><p>As if any of that matters. As if they both don’t know that Cass would cut her own finger off for a chance.</p><p> </p><p>“I want you to stop running from me. I want you to answer my texts, I want you to fucking talk to me, and not talk to her.”</p><p> </p><p>There's a pause as realization strikes on Rio’s face, her eyebrows furrowing as she puts words to her epiphany.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, did seeing me with someone else bother you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snaps her mouth shut, her lips pulled tight in a thin line, knowing the words at the tip of her tongue will get her into more trouble than they are worth. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, that’s not fair. You can’t tell me who I can and can’t date.”</p><p> </p><p>Like she doesn’t know that. Does Rio think she is stupid?</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care if it’s fair.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flinches as if she just received a physical blow. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re right. I can’t imagine what that would feel like. Seeing me with someone else? Kissing someone else? Putting a deposit down on an apartment with–”</p><p> </p><p>“Enough! Now, you’re being unfair!”</p><p> </p><p>“Am I, really? Is that not what’s going on, Agatha? You looked me in the eye and lied to my fucking face.”</p><p> </p><p>“If you would just let me explain–”</p><p> </p><p>“What is there left to say?” a heavy sigh rumbles from somewhere deep in Rio’s chest, her hands running over the flesh of her sunken face. “Just… be honest with me for a second. Is there an apartment, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Well, t-technically yes, but–”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I’m done.”</p><p> </p><p>The silence that follows Rio’s words is thick, Agatha’s throat straining to swallow the air soaked in it. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t mean that.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice cracks over every syllable as her body works to suppress the urge to fall to her knees.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I do.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can immediately feel the simple words settling under her skin, building a home deep in the layers of her epidermis. The urge to lash out is all consuming, a feral cat backed into a corner, her ears flattening, her hackles rising. She takes a step forward, trying to push herself through the feeling, her finger poking accusingly at Rio’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>No, you fucking don’t.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Drops of spittle fly from her lips, her eyes wide and crazed. She cannot lose her, the only part of her life that has ever fucking meant anything. <em> She’d be damned if she didn’t go down without a fight. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t back down, her feet planted firmly in the ground as the distance closes between them.</p><p> </p><p>“What did you think was going to happen, Agatha? I would sneak over while Ralph’s at work? Babysit your kids on date night? Be the maid of honor at your wedding? Hide under the train of your big white dress as I eat you out before you leave for your honeymoon? You didn’t actually think this could work did you? It had to end eventually, so why not right now? Before I waste anymore time in love with someone who will never want me back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost misses Rio’s shaken confession over the sound of her own blood pumping wildly in her ears. They are so close now, Agatha can smell Rio’s signature cologne, the familiarity of the scent wrapping around her like a warm blanket.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> In love with? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Did Rio just say she is in love with her? That can’t be right. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes take on a mind of their own, dropping down to Rio’s lips. It’s all too much and not enough. The inches of space between them suddenly feel painful, the person whose warmth she has been craving for days dangling just out of reach.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>T-That’s not what I want.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Her voice is so small it could be mistaken for a whisper in the wind, Agatha’s fingers flexing against the burn of Rio’s skin through the fabric of her jersey.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Tell me what you want then.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze flits to meet Rio’s own, the catcher already looking back at her, her eyes squinted intently as if she is trying to see into Agatha’s mind.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I don’t know.” </em></p><p> </p><p>She can’t help but be honest in this moment, as her hand moves to carefully cup Rio’s cheek. Her best friend automatically gravitating towards the touch, almost as if her body has been craving this just as much as Agatha’s has.</p><p> </p><p>She may not be able to admit it, but she can’t stop herself from chasing this feeling. She leans forward slowly, giving Rio ample time to pull away. She tilts her head just before their lips meet softly in the middle, a delicate press, a plea for more.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses before responding, the tension leaving her shoulders in an instant as she melts into the experience, her hands gripping Agatha’s hips, pulling her closer.</p><p> </p><p>The pitcher’s entire body lights up at the feeling. Comfort, arousal, and guilt are suddenly fighting for dominance in her stomach but none of it fucking matters as Rio’s mouth moves fervently against hers, the exposed skin of their arms teasing the sensation Agatha has come to adore. </p><p> </p><p>Her other hand finds the hem of Rio’s shirt as her tongue begs for entrance, her nails scraping along the familiarly soft skin of Rio’s tummy. The desire to merge into her counterpart's flesh quickly overpowers every other instinct.</p><p> </p><p>Their tongues meet and fireworks explode in Agatha’s chest, a well missed heat already beginning to blossom between her thighs. Rio’s mouth is warm and wet and exactly how Agatha left it, a whimper sounding high in her throat at the thought. </p><p> </p><p>The moment comes to an abrupt end as the catcher disconnects their lips, wrenching herself from Agatha’s grip and ending up three feet away from her. Her lips are glistening with Agatha’s saliva, her chest heaving for a breath as if she had been underwater for months. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whines at the sight of her, at the new distance, at the cruelty of it all. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>W-We can’t do this anymore, Agatha.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“<em>But–</em>”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>No. I need space. You need to figure your shit out. Until then, don’t look at me, don’t talk to me, and don’t tell me who I can and cannot fucking date.” </em></p><p> </p><p>The venom in her words is diluted by the desire painting her features, but the message is loud and clear.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> As long as she is with Ralph, Rio can not be in her life. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>A small, rational part of her brain already knew this, of course, but the sting that follows is almost blinding. The warmth she felt from Rio’s presence fades as quickly as it came, replaced by the bitter numbness she has come to know intimately over the past few days. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns, walking away from her without waiting for a response. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> But where’s the fun in that? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You really think I care who you fuck? Knock yourself out, Captain. Just do me a favor and stop being a coward. <em> Suck it up and play the fucking game.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s steps stop for a moment, giving Agatha a shred of hope that she will stay, or say something, or maybe even kiss her again. </p><p> </p><p>The deafening silence is interrupted by the pitch of a whistle blowing in the distance, they both recognize it as a five minute warning for the start of the semi-finals. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tilts her head, glancing back at Agatha over her shoulder, her tone soft but solemn.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Well, I think that’s your cue. Good luck, babe.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>With that, Rio leaves and Agatha lets her go, the desire to have the last word draining with the rest of her fight as reality finally sets in. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes out her limbs, a futile attempt to get back in the right headspace, as she begins her journey back to the dugout, already preparing herself for Lilia’s speech about pre-game captain responsibilities.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It’s time to be the girl everyone expects her to be. </em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>By the time Rio makes it back to the field, her lips still tingling with the heat of Agatha’s touch, the other team’s captains are already waiting by homeplate, the ump glaring at the late arrivals with a coin in his hand.</p><p> </p><p>Normally, this is where Agatha and Rio would walk up together, a duo, a team, a united front. The ump would flip the coin and Agatha would call tails. They would shake the other captain’s hands and the game would start.</p><p> </p><p>Since she is not playing, Rio has been relegated to the bench, Carol temporarily taking over her position as co-captain. She knows the other catcher is not much of a threat but there is still a twinge of jealousy at the sight of someone else in her place, of Agatha standing by someone else’s side.</p><p> </p><p>They end up losing the coin toss, allowing the other team to choose the setup of the innings. They end up picking ‘away’, which comes with the advantage of batting first. Some teams prefer this spot because it gives them the opportunity to score first and set the tone for the rest of the game. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes track Agatha as she makes her way to the mound, rolling her shoulder at an attempt to loosen it up. From this distance, Rio can see the furrow of Agatha’s eyebrows underneath her face mask, the tightly pulled line of her lips, a combination of physical and emotional pain culminating on her normally stone cold face.</p><p> </p><p>Her heart breaks a little at the sight, her instincts screaming at her to run out on the field and beg to take it all back, to forget everything that just happened and go home. Instead, she leans back on the bench, her muscles clenching with the familiar battle of wills. </p><p> </p><p>She can’t allow herself to get that close to Agatha again. It’s like her brain malfunctions, her body overriding all sense and rational arguments as it steals the metaphorical reins, happy to give into her desires despite the consequences. One brush of Agatha’s lips and she is on her knees, trying not to choke on her tongue as she apologizes for ever even considering taking space. </p><p> </p><p>Even before that first kiss, Rio had always acknowledged how attractive her best friend was, an undeniable fact of life, something anyone with two working eyes could see. She had always been drawn to her, her presence had always pulled Rio’s attention, but it was never like this. A raw, powerful ache in her chest that only seems to ease when Agatha smiles at her. An undeniable need to wrap a collar around her throat, to hand Agatha the leash with an accompanying whimper that confesses <em> ‘I swear I’ll follow you anywhere, there is no need to yank so hard </em>–</p><p> </p><p>“So what did she want?”</p><p> </p><p>A syrupy sweet voice interrupts her spiral. Her eyes turn to meet the source, grateful for the welcome distraction.</p><p> </p><p>Cass is sitting there smiling back at her, seated unreasonably close on the long bench.</p><p> </p><p>When did she even get there?</p><p> </p><p>Was Rio so wrapped up in staring at and thinking about Agatha that she missed an entire human being taking up the space inches away from her?</p><p> </p><p>Cass’ hands start to wring each other in her lap, her cheeks dusting a light pink at the unanswered question hanging between them. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha was right to feel a little jealous… what Rio had previously thought to be an awkward friendliness might actually be more of a school-girl crush. </p><p> </p><p>It seems like she has been missing a lot of things recently. Distracted, her vision distorted by rose colored glasses, or whatever the fuck you want to call it. Every corner of her mind has been overcome by Agatha. The green specks in her blue eyes, the waves of her long brown hair, the pout she proudly displays when she doesn’t get her way. How else can anyone explain her complete lack of observational skills, her recently developed inability to use critical analysis?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes had looked so earnest, her palms had rested so delicately on Rio’s face. How could she have not seen the lie? The pitcher has always been a master of improv and fabrications but this was to a whole nother level. </p><p> </p><p>Even if she wasn’t lying, would it even matter? It doesn’t change the facts of the case… <em> It doesn't change the tragic ending they accepted the second they took their first steps down this road.  </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> But God, what a way to go. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Ahem, Earth to Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>She blinks back into the conversation, not realizing that she has been absently staring at Cass’ face for the entirety of her millionth spiral over the past 3 weeks.</p><p> </p><p>What was once a twinge of color has transformed into a full blown blush, Cass’ cheeks currently glowing a bright red at what she must assume is Rio’s full attention. </p><p> </p><p>“Uh, sorry, I spaced out there for a second.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jeez Captain, I know I have pretty eyes but there is no need to get lost in them.”</p><p> </p><p>She punctuates her flirty line with a tuck of hair behind her own ear and another nudge to Rio’s shoulder, a move that she has now decidedly categorized as not friendly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lets out a nervous chuckle as she turns her attention back to the game, now that she recognizes Cass’ intentions, her body is physically protesting the idea of entertaining anyone that is not her pitcher. </p><p> </p><p>“Soo, back to my original question, what did Agatha want?”</p><p> </p><p>Cass’ voice sounds strained, like she is trying too hard to come off casual and uninterested in Rio’s answer.</p><p> </p><p>Without taking her eyes off of the mound, Rio works quickly to think of a plausible lie. Unhelpfully, her brain instead chooses to supply images of what actually happened during their time in the woods. The fight, the yelling, the kiss, Agatha’s nails scraping against the skin under her jersey, her best friend’s need thick enough to taste through the whimper she slipped between Rio’s lips. How close she was to pushing Agatha up against the nearest tree, how bad she wanted to–</p><p> </p><p>“She just asked how I was feeling, uh you know, when I will be able to play again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels a soft hand land on her forearm, the gesture meant to be thoughtful and comforting, but it only seems to leave a sour taste in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s right! How are you feeling? You poor thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can hear the pout in her voice as Cass’ thumb starts moving, rubbing gentle circles into her tanned skin.</p><p> </p><p>The catcher says nothing as she contemplates her next move. This is what she should want right? A distraction. A fix. Someone who is not Agatha Harkness. Maybe this is what she needs. She certainly wouldn’t have thought twice about it before.</p><p> </p><p>Almost as if she sensed the thought, Agatha’s head snaps towards the dugout, her eyes locking with Rio’s before travelling lower, spotting Cass’ hand. Rio feels all of the blood in her veins run cold, their last conversation fresh in her mind.</p><p> </p><p>The pitcher's eyes widen before narrowing into slits, her body going rigid as she forces her gaze back to the batter’s box. She twists the ball against her thigh faster than usual, the look on her face venomous as she completes her windup, the bright green bullet shooting from the heel of her palm.</p><p> </p><p>The pitch flies by the batter in a blur, the smack of it hitting Carol’s glove loud enough to make Rio wince, while the crowd erupts in cheers. Her left hand flexes against her thigh, the muscle memory of the sting that accompanies that sound ingrained in her bones. </p><p> </p><p>Is Agatha serious right now? How can she possibly be angry about someone having a crush on Rio when she has a whole boyfriend?</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘You really think I care who you fuck? Knock yourself out, Captain.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Those last words repeat on a loop in her mind, the hurt that accompanied them still itching under her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Is that all this was to Agatha? A good fuck? And now, what? She is mad she lost custody of her little toy?</p><p> </p><p>Regretfully, the thought of being Agatha’s ‘little toy’ does things to her that she refuses to name right now. So instead, she chooses to be mad. She will sulk and ignore Agatha until the other girl is forced to examine why she dragged Rio into this mess in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>If it was just about sex, why couldn't she have just gone to her boyfriend? Or better yet, anyone else on campus? Why did it have to be Rio, the only person in this world who knows Agatha enough to truly fall in love with every part of her?</p><p> </p><p>Why did it have to be her?</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>A pop fly dings off of a Louisville Slugger, the ball so high in the air, even Rio loses it in the lights. Natasha calls for responsibility, her head tilted back confidently as the easy last out drops into her glove. </p><p> </p><p>The crowd is almost unbearably loud as their team rushes the field, Rio following closely behind with a slightly exaggerated limp, her giddy excitement at moving onto the championships almost trumping the rest of her disastrous emotional state.</p><p> </p><p>That percentage exponentially shrinks as she watches Agatha subtly dodge the group hug at the mound, evading overjoyed arms trying to pull her in.</p><p> </p><p>When did Agatha become so averse to physical contact? The catcher quickly thinks back to the thousands of times she has wrapped herself around the pitcher, yet she can’t think of one instance where the girl ever pulled away. Has Rio always been the only one allowed?</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, the girls head back into the dugout to pack their stuff away, Agatha excluded as she is called over for an interview with an anchor from ESPN. No matter how hard Rio’s ears strain, she can’t pick up the conversation over the noise, but she assumes it is probably about how Agatha is seemingly breaking her own records at every other appearance this playoff run, her pitch moving almost suspiciously faster week to week. </p><p> </p><p>A major part of her feels guilty, knowing Agatha was pushing her aching shoulder to the limit probably just because she was pissed at Rio. She is obviously happy that Agatha is finally getting the attention she deserves, that they are all heading to the championships, but she didn’t want it to happen like this. The final games of their career together passing her by while she warms the bench because she can’t look Agatha in the eye. </p><p> </p><p>She gives up on her doomed espionage mission and moves further into the dugout. She didn’t play so she is able to pack up quickly, already heading back towards the bus before most girls have even taken off their cleats. Cass trails closely behind her as they silently make their way past the stands. Or, at least, it would be silent if the sound of giggles and squeals didn’t suddenly fill the air.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh great. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Since the game was only an hour away from campus, the school sent a student bus to ensure they had crowd support, the aptly named ‘fan club’ sitting in the first few rows of the stands. They beckon her over and she goes, mostly because she wants an excuse to keep an eye on Agatha as she finally heads to the dugout to get ready to leave.</p><p> </p><p>She recognizes most of their faces, already familiar with the group of sapphics who show up to their games just to root for the queer girls on the team. </p><p> </p><p>They all babble to the point that the sounds of their voices blend together, Rio would have a hard time understanding them even if she was actually listening. Instead, her full attention was on her pitcher, Agatha’s face telling the story of someone who just got told Christmas is cancelled, rather than someone who, moments ago, finally achieved a childhood dream. </p><p> </p><p>Her posture is slumped, the pout on her face transforming into a wince as she tosses her bag over her shoulder. The sight alone is almost enough for Rio to forfeit the war of pride they have been fighting, her feet already inching towards the other girl.</p><p> </p><p>Just as she is about to break, to admit defeat and do anything in her power to lighten Agatha’s load, the pitcher looks up. Rio’s breath catches in her throat for a moment, scared she has been caught staring. Instead, Agatha’s gaze is pointed towards the other side of the field, a man walking in her direction. </p><p> </p><p>Ralph’s strides are long and purposeful, the smile on his face so bright it is blinding Rio from 50 feet away. Her eyes move back to Agatha, watching the rise and fall of her chest as she plasters a fake smile across her face. </p><p> </p><p>The pitcher gathers her things and meets him at the mouth of the dugout. He immediately grabs hold of her, lifting her feet off of the ground as he places obnoxious kisses all over the side of her face, his body language beaming with pride.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knows she should look away, she knows this is doing nothing but twisting the knife that is currently rusting in its spot, wedged between the bones of her ribcage. But she can’t. It’s like driving by a bad car accident, her eyes can't help but assess the scene, her mouth hanging open in awe of the damage. </p><p> </p><p>Ralph finally puts Agatha back down, planting a kiss on her lips as her feet hit the grass, before grabbing her softball bag, and walking her back towards their bus. </p><p> </p><p>The view of their retreating backs does something to Rio, an elbow suddenly nudging all of her organs out of place, her body feeling heavy but hollow. The only emotion that seems to remain is grief.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But what is grief if not love preserving? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> — </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Three long days have passed since that last game, the championships officially five days away. Three days of not seeing Agatha’s face. Six days since the last time she touched a softball. </p><p> </p><p>Restless would be an understatement. </p><p> </p><p>Recently, Rio’s schedule has been packed. Between softball, school, and spending time with Agatha, she has barely had time to think.</p><p> </p><p>Now, all Rio has is time. With her ‘injury’ keeping her from practice, exam week coming to a close, and Agatha actually respecting her demands to be left alone, all Rio can do is ruminate. </p><p> </p><p>Which is really just code for replaying the entire past four years on a loop in her head, watching it back like a movie she is about to be tested on.</p><p> </p><p>Alice has tried, really tried. The other girl has made it her mission to force Rio out of her room at least once per day. Rio wants it to work, she really does, but instead she stares at the walls of the bar while Agatha’s laugh rings in her ears. She pushes the tater tots around on her plate whilst the ghost of Agatha’s tongue draws lines down her throat. She gets lost in the leaves of the trees, the green of them transporting her back to the hues that dance in Agatha’s eyes. </p><p> </p><p>All to say, she might be going insane. </p><p> </p><p>She can’t remember the last time she was<em> this </em> hung up on a girl. Obsessed beyond the point of reason. She mentally tries to relive her past relationships as she tosses and turns, looking for even a single moment where she felt the way she feels constantly now. She draws a blank as she kicks her top sheet off of the bed, her body unable to get comfortable. The fabrics suddenly rub her the wrong way, the temperature of her pillow always too warm, the emptiness of the space beside her inexplicably suffocating.</p><p> </p><p>She desperately misses the days she used to sleep like a rock, her body pushed to the point of exhaustion. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes scan the details of their dark room until the early hours of the morning, the snail who lives in her ear whispering Agatha’s last words to her as if they were a song that was stuck in her head.</p><p> </p><p>‘<em>Do me a favor and stop being a coward.’ </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> A coward. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘Suck it up and play the fucking game.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>As the birds begin to sing outside of her window, the soft glow of the rising sun painting their walls a rich golden honey, sleep deprived and possibly delusional, Rio makes a decision.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>“Do you really think this is a good idea?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why wouldn’t it be?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm, I don’t know. Maybe let’s ask the bags under your eyes, the tear stains on your pillow, or the pictures of Agatha on your phone that you stare at all day, as if it was somehow possible for you to have forgotten her face since the last time you saw her.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio continues getting dressed, doing her best to ignore the modicum of sense Alice is making. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t get it. I feel like I am going crazy in here. I need to put all of this energy somewhere and that place has always been softball for me.”</p><p> </p><p>“So, you really think you’re ready to see Agatha again? No mental breakdown incoming?”</p><p> </p><p>“Geez, she’s not a serial killer, Alice. She’s just another girl it didn’t work out with.”</p><p> </p><p>A knowing silence fills the air of their room as Rio grabs her shoes from underneath the bed, purposefully avoiding Alice’s gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio… we both know that’s not true.”</p><p> </p><p>The catcher takes her phone off of the charger before heading out into the hallway, Alice’s words left hanging in the space as she closes the door behind her.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>“What’s up, Doc?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio calls as she enters the athletic trainer’s exam room, already very familiar with the kind blonde woman who runs the office. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know how many times I have to tell you but I am not a doctor, Rio.” She lets out a long suffering sigh as she moves to greet the catcher. “So, how’s the leg feeling?” </p><p> </p><p>“Much better! I think I am ready to go, so if you could just clear me now, I think I’d still be able to make today’s practice.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio puts on her most innocent face, already flexing her leg to show off its healthy status. The recovery process tends to be quicker for those who were never actually hurt in the first place, but she doesn’t need to know that.</p><p> </p><p>“Woah, slow down there, soldier. Run through your stretching routine and let me know if anything hurts.”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio does. She bends over, forwards and backwards, lifts her leg onto a number of increasingly higher boxes, prepared to drop into the splits if she has to.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, okay. I see someone has miraculously recovered from an injury that normally takes 3-4 weeks to fully heal.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio strategically decides not to respond to that, her thumbs twiddling in her lap as she waits with big eyes for her verdict. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, you’re cleared, but no practice today. You can start tomorrow. I’ll be sure to send Lilia an email with your approval.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t fight her grin as she hops off of the medical table. The reality of getting back to softball again in reach. Another, unfortunately, much bigger part of her, is excited to finally have an excuse to see Agatha again, even if they are fighting. Rio can only think about someone so much before the need to be physically near them becomes overpowering. But she knows she has to focus, to prepare herself to stick by her boundaries. </p><p> </p><p>She is not going to roll over again for Agatha Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t make you regret it, Doc!”</p><p> </p><p>She approaches the door, excitement and nerves making her pulse flutter in her chest. </p><p> </p><p>“And Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>She looks over her shoulder, waiting for the rest of the sentence, her toes already wiggling with anticipation in her shoes–</p><p> </p><p>Jesus. Maybe Alice was right, maybe it is too soon to see Agatha again…</p><p> </p><p>“I better not see you in here for any more ‘pulled muscles’. Take care of yourself, kid.”</p><p> </p><p>Guess it’s too late to back out now.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>She arrives at practice the next day 20 minutes earlier than she is supposed to. It is easy to be on time for things when you can no longer get a good night's sleep.</p><p> </p><p>She is momentarily surprised when she sees Agatha already there, pitching to a very tired looking Carol from full distance across the field. Her hair is frizzy, beads of sweat dripping down the sides of her face. </p><p> </p><p>How long have they been here for?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was always loose with her physical limits, Rio recalling the many times she would catch the pitcher sneaking out of the house late at night for extra reps. It was like she had this insatiable hunger, a desire for constant improvement and knowledge well beyond what was expected of her. It is one of the reasons they have made it so far this season. It is also one of the traits Rio has come to love most about her.</p><p> </p><p>She figured out early on that there was no point in trying to stop her, so instead, Rio turned all of her energy towards making sure Agatha was safe and supported as she explored. This would typically manifest as forcing Agatha to stay hydrated and to eat well, reminding her to use her heating pad after a long day, and massaging the tight knots out of her shoulder when she would inevitably overdo it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was always a natural caretaker but something about Agatha made her want to lean into the role, to put a metaphorical sledgehammer through her emotional walls with nothing but consistent affection.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, would you look at who decided to show up.”</p><p> </p><p>Coach Lilia’s voice pulls her attention, her head snapping to the left where the older woman has been standing for an unknown amount of time, her gaze also tracking the two girls warming up in the corner.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! It’s nice to see you too–”</p><p> </p><p>“How long has she been here?”</p><p> </p><p>Right to it then.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, I don’t know, I just got here… but I’d guess awhile.”</p><p> </p><p>The coach shakes her head in a tired sort of way, her gray curls bouncing with the movement.</p><p> </p><p>“What are we going to do with that girl.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s obviously a rhetorical question so Rio doesn’t answer, her eyes instead drifting back to the source of both of their concerns.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha throws another pitch, this one a tad too low. Carol drops to her knees attempting to block the ball from getting behind her, but loses her footing, causing her to fall backwards and land directly on her ass. </p><p> </p><p>A familiar cackle pierces through the air, landing a direct hit to Rio’s gut. She should be the one making Agatha laugh. She should be bone-tired and sweaty and teasing her for all of the ants she probably just killed with that terrible pitch.  </p><p> </p><p>In an attempt to avoid another wave of unhealthy thoughts, Rio bends down to lace up her cleats.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m ready, Coach. Call her in.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia looks down at Rio, almost as if she is seeing her in a whole new light, the last piece of the puzzle finally falling into place. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyebrows furrow and she opens her mouth, a question seemingly at the tip of her tongue. Rio holds her breath, silently praying to a higher power that the older woman will choose to ignore the elephant standing behind second base. </p><p> </p><p>“She misses you too, kid.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio barely has time to process the words before Lilia turns back to the field, her pointer finger and thumb making their way into her mouth. A high pitched whistle follows the motion, a pair of heads snapping in their direction. </p><p> </p><p>The moment Agatha recognizes Rio is undeniable, her eyes going wide, her lazy stride gaining a new sense of purpose as she shamelessly leaves a waddling Carol behind to carry the rest of their equipment.</p><p> </p><p>The distance between them closes faster than Rio can mentally prepare for, Agatha’s long ponytail swishing behind her with each step. </p><p> </p><p>And then, she was there, standing in front of Rio like she never left. </p><p> </p><p>The apples of her cheeks were pink with exertion, her breath coming in quick pants as her eyes roved over every inch of the catcher’s face. She almost seemed scared to look away, as if Rio would vanish the second she lost sight of her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s own heart was pounding in her ears, her sweaty palms rubbing against the smooth material of her softball pants. </p><p> </p><p>This is the closest they have been since the kiss in the woods, since Rio demanded to be left alone. </p><p> </p><p>Looking at her now, baby hairs curling at her temples, summer freckles dotting her face, Rio is finding it hard to remember why she would ever make such a torturous request.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No! Bad, Rio! Boundaries! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You’re back?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice is hopeful, an emotion Rio is certain she has only heard a handful of times from her best friend. Treacherous butterflies begin to wreak havoc in her stomach, her body clearly not onboard with the whole ‘boundaries’ movement.</p><p> </p><p>She has been thinking about this moment for days, the inevitable reunion. How Agatha would react to seeing her, what she should say. Yet, somehow, Rio’s mind is blank, the words and aloof glances she had practiced in the mirror clearly amounting to hours wasted. In her defense, nothing could have prepared her for Agatha’s shy smile, the morning sunlight shining in her ethereal blue eyes. It almost looked as if she had been suffering with the distance too, finally gasping in a breath of fresh air after being hit with wave after wave.</p><p> </p><p>All Rio can manage is a quick nod of confirmation, forcing her gaze back to Coach Lilia, a safer place to look while trying to put out the many fires that have just simultaneously ignited all over her body.</p><p> </p><p>Out of her peripheral, she catches Agatha’s chest heave with a sigh of relief, a slow grin teasing at the corners of her lips before she forces it back down. Happy to be treading water but aware that she still can’t touch the ground.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll be pitching with her for the rest of the week, but the two of you need to take it easy. The bench is going to catch fire if Rio spends any more time warming it. Understood?”</p><p> </p><p>They both give embarrassed little nods before turning to make their way to the dugout.</p><p> </p><p>“And, Agatha? No more extra practices. The only thing a tired pitcher is going to help is the other team.”</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha can respond, Carol finally joins the group, sweaty and out of breath from carrying all of their gear back to the dugout.</p><p> </p><p>“W-What’d I miss, Coach?”</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>It’s the day before they leave for the championships and Agatha has spent their last few practices on her best behavior, only talking to Rio when it is necessary and softball related. </p><p> </p><p>There have been no lingering touches, no teasing jabs, no laughs, or late night texts. Agatha has been respectfully following the catcher’s wishes to a tee, keeping her distance and awarding Rio the space she desperately begged for. </p><p> </p><p>All things considered, Rio is losing her mind.</p><p> </p><p>The rational part of her brain tells her that this is a good thing. That the two of them need the space to work out what they want, that anything more than this would be a slippery slope into old habits. </p><p> </p><p>The other, much louder, voice in her head seems to be already dousing the slide with soap, happy to dive back in headfirst. At the end of the day, every moment that they spend in this awkward dance is a waste of the precious time they have left. There is a good chance she could never see Agatha again after graduation, that they will lead completely separate, painfully dull lives. What if this is it for her? Her soulmate? Her last chance at happiness, even if just for a little bit longer… It may hurt like a bitch, but the best things in life always do, right?</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No, Rio. If you love something, set it free. If it comes back– </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, yeah, she knows the fucking quote. </p><p> </p><p>Instead of spending the rest of the night before their early flight listening to her bicker with herself, she unlocks her phone. A little mindless scrolling never hurt anyone.</p><p> </p><p>A cute dog. An edit of a gorgeous woman old enough to be her mother. Top ten MLB plays. Agatha’s interview with espn. An X-ray of a pelvis with a high heel lodged up–</p><p> </p><p>AGATHA’S INTERVIEW WITH ESPN?!</p><p> </p><p>Before she can second guess the decision, her finger is already unmuting the video, Agatha’s voice booming through the speakers of her tangled wired headphones.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>... just a lot of practice and hard work. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>She responds to a question Rio didn’t hear, her smile fake in its politeness.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>And is there a lucky Mr. Harkness back home?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t help the way her eyes roll, knowing a man would never get that type of question after leading his team to such a monumental victory. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Why, yes there is.</em>" Agatha responds without missing a beat, the character she is playing all-too familiar. "<em>He’s probably around here somewhere, though I don’t see why that’s relevant. It’s not like he struck out 17 batters tonight.” </em></p><p> </p><p>She adds that last bit on with an extra helping of Harkness charm, the reporter not even picking up on the diss as she laughs along.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Speaking of other halves, your counterpart was noticeably missing from today’s match. Was it hard to play your first collegiate level game without Vidal behind the plate?” </em></p><p> </p><p>She is taken aback at first, not by being mentioned but by the idea that that was Agatha’s first college appearance without Rio. She tries to think back, to spot the exception but the numbers don’t lie. </p><p> </p><p>She was so caught up in their fight that she didn’t even realize she had left Agatha alone on the mound for the first time in four years. A new wave of guilt wraps its fingers around her heart as the performer’s mask vanishes off of Agatha’s face, the question taking her completely off guard.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Well, uh, of course it was. I have obviously played with many catchers in the past but I just have something, um, special with Rio. There is a trust and a love between us– I mean, the whole team loves her too. It– I just– I mean we all just miss her a great deal. She’s our friend and she belongs out here with me– and uh, the rest of the team, too.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha uncharacteristically stumbles through her words, rushing them out of her mouth as if they were burning her throat on the way up. By the time she finishes, her eyes are comically wide, and her mouth promptly sealed shut, her cheeks puffing out adorably.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Well it sounds like you two have a really beautiful friendship. I think we all hope she is able to come back soon.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha just nods her head, clearly left with a new distrust of her own voice. Rio has never seen her like this before, a spotlight shining down on her and yet she is shaking like she has suddenly forgotten all of her lines.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Well this has been great, Agatha. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me tonight, and good luck next weekend at the championships!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The screen goes black as the video comes to an end. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> What the fuck was that? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>The entire next day, Rio can’t get the interview out of her head. From the bus, to the plane, to the field, she is stuck with the echo of Agatha’s rambled words. </p><p> </p><p>And yet, no matter how many times she secretly rewatches the clip, she can’t make sense of it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness, the queen of characters, a witty response always on the tip of her tongue, went on national TV and–</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Said that she loved Rio?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Well, technically, she implied it, but it’s more than that. </p><p> </p><p>She choked.</p><p> </p><p>The interviewer mentioned Rio and Agatha Harkness fucking choked. </p><p> </p><p>What is she supposed to do with that information? </p><p> </p><p>She’s so caught up in her thoughts, that she barely hears Coach Sharon calling out the lineup, her name notably missing from the list. </p><p> </p><p>Instinctually, her eyes find Agatha, the pitcher looking back at her with a similar state of confusion. </p><p> </p><p>“Coach, I thought I was going to be pitching with Rio today?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha speaks up first, already making her way to the lip of the dugout with her battle face on, prepared for a showdown. </p><p> </p><p>“I figured we would give her one more day of rest.” Coach Lilia shrugs, like the answer is obvious. “She just came off of injury leave, kid. Don’t worry, if everything goes well today, you’ll be pitching with her again tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks as if she is about to fight back but the voice of the ump asking for the final lineup cuts her off. Lilia and Sharon head out to home plate to do the trade off, effectively solidifying the decision. </p><p> </p><p>“Looks like it's me and you again, Captain.”</p><p> </p><p>Carol teases with a big grin on her face, already hustling to her bag to grab her gear. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t even bother responding, pushing past every other member of the team before arriving right in front of Rio, who is currently still sitting on the bench. </p><p> </p><p>“This is bullshit.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is towering over her, arms crossed over her chest like a petulant child.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stares up at her, mesmerized by the sight. She almost forgot just how beautiful Agatha looks when she’s angry. Intimidating and sharp, yet undeniably breathtaking.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay, Agatha.” She’s not sure why she does it, her brain probably officially short circuiting with how hard she has been working it, but she takes Agatha’s hand gently into her own, her thumb rubbing soft circles into the flesh. “You are going to be great, and I will be over here, cheering you on the entire time.”</p><p> </p><p>All of the tension in Agatha’s posture melts in an instant, her feet instinctually taking a step closer to Rio, subtly boxing her in. </p><p> </p><p>She feels her breath catch in her throat at the proximity, the sound of her body’s warning alarms muffled by the incessant beat of her heart racing in her chest. The noise of the dugout fades around them as Agatha’s pleading eyes stare back into Rio’s own. She is not sure what her best friend is asking for, but in this moment, she is prepared to give her the world.</p><p> </p><p>The ump’s whistle blows and Agatha’s hand drops hers, the spell broken by the cruel call of their reality. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Thank you. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whispers it like a secret, Rio nods in understanding even though she is sure she has done nothing to deserve the pitcher’s gratitude. </p><p> </p><p>Her best friend takes one last look back at her, a small smile gracing her otherwise tired features, before she makes her way to the plate for the coin toss. </p><p> </p><p>God, this better be the last time Agatha walks up there without Rio, for everyone’s sake. </p><p> </p><p>There is always tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>The girls win the first game of the championships by a landslide, the entire match neck and neck until the 7th inning. Alice was on third base, with one out, the game tied 3-3. Wanda stepped up to the plate lefty, a choice she only makes when Lilia sends the call for a slap hit. </p><p> </p><p>The pitch came in and Maximoff started her run up, making contact with the ball right before it crossed the strike zone, sending a hard hit grounder right between the first and second basemen, where it bounced into right field. </p><p> </p><p>Alice ran home and scored, putting them in the lead and promptly ending the game as they had the last at bat. </p><p> </p><p>They were all still smiling and laughing as they made their way onto the bus that would take them to their hotel, already talking about the possibilities of tomorrow’s game. </p><p> </p><p>Coach Sharon walked up and down the aisles of the transport, announcing room assignments and handing out sandwiches and keys. </p><p> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Agatha and Rio were paired up again, the two of them avoiding each other’s eye across the aisle as Sharon passed off the key card and their subs.</p><p> </p><p>All too quickly, they were at the hotel, luggage in hand, standing outside of their shared room. Neither of them spoke about the moment they had shared in the dugout, the first time they had resembled themselves together in over a week. Agatha didn’t bring up what it meant to her, so Rio kept the knots in her stomach to herself. </p><p> </p><p>With the door unlocked and their clothes changed, the two of them sat in an awkward kind of silence, both trying to avoid the elephant in the room while they ate their dinner. The elephant being what they did together the last time they were in this situation.</p><p> </p><p>Even just the thought of that night, the solidification of something real between them, had Rio’s heart and thighs clenching simultaneously. </p><p> </p><p>If she could go back to that moment, knowing what she knew now, she would do it over again in an instant. She would have held on tighter, lingered for longer, maybe even taken Agatha up on her idea to never check out. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe, in another universe, she did. Maybe they are still there. Kicked off of the team and broke from the cost of room service, but still together. They would eventually have to barricade the room in at some point, management breaking down their door when the accounts ran dry. </p><p> </p><p>And yet, somehow, that still sounds better than this.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you for coming back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice is quiet as she takes another bite of her sub, her gaze trained at the bedsheets in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t have missed it for the world.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio responds without thinking, causing Agatha’s head to snap up, their eyes meeting across the small aisle between their beds. The space feels intimate, the atmosphere thick with all the words they both want to say. </p><p> </p><p>“... and I’m sorry it took me so long to realize that.”</p><p> </p><p>The features of Agatha’s face soften beyond recognition at Rio’s words, adoration and heartbreak distorting her features in equal measure. The vinegar of her italian sub drips down her fingers, landing into the foil.</p><p> </p><p>The temptation to reach out is almost all-consuming, her body thrumming with the sudden need to feel Agatha’s warmth. To touch soft skin and get lost in the sensation of worship, even if only for one more night.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I miss you.</em>” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze falls back down to her hands as she utters the three words. They land in Rio’s gut like a stone.</p><p> </p><p>She has seen this movie before, she already knows the ending.</p><p> </p><p>With that thought fresh in her mind, Rio is up, her feet already moving towards the shoes she left by the door, her sub forgotten on the bed. She knows what will happen if she stays.</p><p> </p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha yelps out in surprise as Rio’s hand grabs the knob of the door.</p><p> </p><p>“I just need a second.”</p><p> </p><p>She responds over her shoulder without looking back, the door shutting behind her before Agatha can answer. </p><p> </p><p>The hum of the hallway light rings in her ears as she heads towards the elevators, her destination still unknown.</p><p> </p><p>When she looks up again, she is standing in front of the hotel bar in her pajamas, a pair of sweatpants and a loose tank top. </p><p> </p><p>A drink does sound good right now, even if everyone around her seems to be donning business casual.</p><p> </p><p>She flags down the bartender and orders a shot of whiskey and a beer. The dark alcohol goes down quick, the burn of it immediately making her face feel warm, her thoughts already beginning to dull around the edges. </p><p> </p><p>She grabs her beer and chooses a stool in the corner, intent on wallowing in her spirits and sorrows undisturbed. </p><p> </p><p>Two hours, another shot, and a few beers later, Rio is feeling properly buzzed. The topic she was aiming to erase with the liquor has, ironically, only increased in its presence, her mind solely producing images of Agatha against her will. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hugging her after a game, her smile radiant after another win. Agatha cuddled sleepily into her chest, her breath soft and shallow as her fingers danced over the flesh of Rio’s tummy. Agatha sandwiched between her thighs, her hands holding Rio’s hips still as she squirmed against her tongue. Agatha. Agatha. Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Rio deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for her strength in this moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Drinking all alone, handsome?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lazily rolls her head on her neck, her gaze meeting the blue eyes that produced the low voice.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Almost as blue as Agatha’s. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Seems like it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio responds as she looks the woman up and down. Late twenties, possibly early thirties, long black hair curtaining the white button up and smart slacks the stranger wears. Her eyes are trailing a path down Rio’s exposed arms, a wolfish grin announcing her intentions to anyone with a brain.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I think we should amend that immediately, what do you say?”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice is deep and measured, seductive in a way that only older women can seem to pull off. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> The only exception being Agatha, of course. Rio always loved when her tone got– </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have all night, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Impatient, just like Aga– </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“The seat’s all yours.”</p><p> </p><p>“Smart man.”</p><p> </p><p>A younger Rio (a month younger to be exact) would have loved this, she thinks nostalgically. An older woman hitting on her so shamelessly, baby Rio would have been drooling, begging for a chance.</p><p> </p><p>This Rio, even with a solid few drinks in her system, just nods her head in acknowledgement.</p><p> </p><p>“Not much of a talker, huh? Just my type.” </p><p> </p><p>She teases Rio as she brings her glass up to her mouth, lipstick stains already littering the rim of the glass.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha would be livid if she had heard that. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘Clearly, she doesn’t know you that well. I can barely get you to shut up.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The ghost of Agatha’s voice whispers in her ear, confirming Rio’s suspicions. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘Is she trying to sleep with you or murder you? This vibe is leaving a lot to be desired.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio tries shaking her head to restart her brain, her imagination running wild with how Agatha would react if she was here.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you wanna take this ‘not-conversation’ somewhere quieter?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘Real confident too. Does she really think this mysterious older woman schtick will work on you?’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio chugs the rest of her beer as she stands up.</p><p> </p><p>“Lead the way.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘You’re kidding me, right? Her? You’re going to sleep with somebody’s drunk aunt while I am probably worried sick about you all alone in OUR room?’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The unnamed woman smiles like she already knew Rio’s answer, leaving a cash and a tip for both of their drinks on the table before heading to the elevators.</p><p> </p><p>She presses the button for her floor, while Rio stares at the number 6, where she knows Agatha is waiting for her.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘It’s not too late, Rio. You can still come back.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The elevator dings, announcing their arrival. The woman uses her key card to unlock the room, a much nicer suite than the one three floors down and eight doors to the left, where Rio is supposed to be. </p><p> </p><p>Imaginary Agatha is uncharacteristically quiet. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t even know your name, stranger.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman questions while pouring two drinks from an expensive bottle. One for her and one for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Does it matter?”</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose not.”</p><p> </p><p>She hands off the cup and takes Rio’s hand, leading her to the edge of the bed before sitting herself down.</p><p> </p><p>“Make yourself at home. I promise I only bite when provoked.”</p><p> </p><p>She winks while patting the spot beside her.</p><p> </p><p>This is what she should want. This should fix her. She will forget about Agatha and finally be able to move on with her life. No more boyfriends or apartments. No more obsessing about the structure of her gorgeous nose. No more Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She takes the seat offered, the woman’s hand making its way onto Rio’s thigh, her head dipping down to place soft kisses on the skin beneath her jaw.</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a hefty swig of her drink, trying to ignore the bitter ache that comes with the stranger’s touch. It is just not right, it is just not <em> her. </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘I miss you.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her pitcher’s last words echo in her ears, no imaginary Agatha needed. A powerful wave of intoxication works its way through her body, the drinks suddenly hitting hard on her half empty stomach.</p><p> </p><p>She wishes she had finished her sandwich in the room. She wishes she was with Agatha, even if it was awkward and quiet, even if she gave in, even if–</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, but I think I have to go.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman pulls back in an instant, the smile on her face replaced with a look of boredom as she puts her drink on her nightstand. </p><p> </p><p>“Disappointing but I’m no kidnapper. The door is unlocked, but if you change your mind, you know where I’ll be.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman falls backwards onto the bed, laying herself down as she kicks the heels off of her feet.</p><p> </p><p>Rio puts her own empty glass down on the table near the bottle as she silently makes her way out of the room, a slight unsteadiness in her step, her emotions sitting at the top of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>She barely makes it to the elevator when she realizes that whatever this is, it's terminal. Modern medicine is yet to make a cure. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Deep down, Rio knows she wouldn’t take it anyway.</em>
