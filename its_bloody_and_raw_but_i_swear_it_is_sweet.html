<div class="userstuff">
<p>The first time Agatha saw her, she was stepping over her mother’s corpse.</p><p>The moment was brief, but Agatha recognized her instantly. She felt a dull sting in the palm of her hand; her mark was burning. It wasn’t a wholly unpleasant sensation, if she was being honest with herself.</p><p>Her mark – the thing that bound every witch in Salem from birth. The mark that was supposed to shine with an angelic, golden light. The mark that, in her case, was pitch black.</p><p>“Who are you?” Agatha demanded of the creature in front of her.</p><p>The creature cocked her head, looking at Agatha with curiosity. She was dressed in a tattered black shroud, her face more bone than flesh. Her movements were stilted, as if her limbs were still getting used to the feeling of being forced to move around.</p><p>That wasn’t the thing that caught Agatha’s attention, however. No, the first thing she noticed when she saw the creature were her large, black eyes. The exact color of Agatha’s mark.</p><p>The color Evanora had resented her for from the moment she was born.</p><p>Looking at the creature now, Agatha could see why her mother had been resentful. Scared, even. She looked inhuman, which Agatha supposed she was, in a way. She reminded Agatha of the fire she had seen as a child, the one that burned down one of the houses in her village. Terrible, yes, but beautiful too. A type of destruction you couldn’t help but watch.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Agatha tried again. Most of her peers – the ones with perfect, golden marks in the palms of their hands, the ones now lying unmoving at her feet – had never met an angel. If they had, it was because they had done something exceptional, something worthy of divine attention.</p><p>The creature sized Agatha up again before turning around and disappearing into nothing, leaving Agatha without an answer. A tightness still clung to the air long after she was gone.</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>Every witch in Salem had one – well, before Agatha killed them all and took their powers, of course. A guardian angel. A being meant to guide a witch on their magical journey, to show them where their powers would thrive. Those protected by Raphael were exceptional healers, those protected by Ariel held a strong connection to nature, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>Agatha didn’t care, hadn’t cared for a long time. Her coven had taken one look at her mark on the day she was born, and had immediately known where she drew her powers from.</p><p>
<em>Death.</em>
</p><p>She’d tried to be good, too. For so long, she resisted the pull of the magic around her, begging her to take, to <em>taste</em>. She’d pleaded with her coven to teach her, to allow her to use her powers, to dispel some of the restless energy coiling just beneath the tips of her fingers.</p><p>They’d refused.</p><p>So, when she was put on trial, a murder of one of the coven’s members spearheaded by her own mother, she’d shown them what she’d been suppressing. Her body had reacted the way it had been begging to. When it finally got a taste of the magic surrounding it, the thing it had been waiting for for eighteen years, it <em>took</em>. Until there was nothing left.</p><p>And god, it felt <em>good</em>. When that last bit of magic drained from her mother’s withered body, she felt the most alive she’d ever been.</p><p>Now, with no one stopping her, who was she not to continue on this path?</p><p>So, she fled Salem, accumulating more power as she went. She started small: when she took her coven’s magic, her body was running on adrenaline, the only choice being to absorb their magic or die. Without that incentive, she needed to be more careful. She singled out lone witches, lured them into the woods and goaded them into attacking her with their power.</p><p>And if she sometimes felt a pair of pitch black eyes following her moves, watching how she drained the life out of witch after witch after witch? Well. It didn’t hurt to put on a bit of a show, did it?</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>The second time Agatha saw her, years had passed since their first meeting. Agatha had been honing her powers, getting stronger. She was no longer luring single witches into the forest. No, now there were groups following her and ultimately meeting their tragic fate at her hands.</p><p>It was on one of those days, when the corpses of five witches lay by her feet and she was feeling slightly drunk on the power she’d just absorbed, that the creature showed her face again.</p><p>She had changed over the years. Her body was now covered in a soft flesh, more human. There was no mistaking her for anything other than what she was, though. She’d learned to move more gracefully throughout the years, but there was still something unnatural about the way she carried herself. And then there were her eyes: still the same pitch black they’d been when Agatha had first seen her. The same color she carried everywhere in the palm of her hand.</p><p>The moment she saw her, Agatha wanted… well, just that. She <em>wanted</em>. To learn more about this creature she had been bound to since birth. To learn about who she was, where she came from, why she chose to show her face on Earth. To know her.</p><p>The creature was standing by a tree. Not hiding, per se, but still sheltering herself from view. A force of habit from eons of staying hidden, surely.</p><p>Agatha wanted to bring her into the light.</p><p>“Are you just going to watch and run away again, or am I allowed to talk to you this time?”</p><p>The creature didn’t answer, but she didn’t run, either.</p><p>“Who are you?” Agatha asked again, a repeat of the first words she had uttered to her.</p><p>“Death.” The creature’s voice was gravelly, like it hadn’t been used in a long time. It probably hadn’t. Was this the first time she had spoken?</p><p>“Very cute. But what do I call you?”</p><p>The creature cocked her head, looking around the forest. Her eyes landed on a nearby stream, stained red with the fresh blood of Agatha’s victims.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“‘Rio’, hm?” The creature – <em>Rio</em> – stared again, a wariness in her eyes. “I like it. It suits you.”</p><p>A small smile formed on Rio’s lips. When Agatha stepped closer, however, she hastily stepped back.</p><p>“Wait!” Agatha shouted before Rio could disappear. That familiar <em>want</em> stirred in her again, but it felt different this time. She didn’t want to take Rio’s power, wasn’t even sure if she could.</p><p>“Will I see you again?” The question had a desperate edge to it, but Agatha didn’t care. She wanted, <em>needed</em> to know more about Rio.</p><p>That small smile played on Rio’s lips again. “You might.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t wait.</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>The next time they met, only a few months had passed. To Agatha, it felt like a lifetime. She’d refocused her efforts, hunting covens that hoarded old tomes and hidden grimoires – secret knowledge they refused to teach to anyone outside their coven.</p><p>There usually wasn’t a coven left to teach after Agatha had come by. And wouldn’t it be a shame to let all that knowledge go to waste?</p><p>One such coven was in the woods with her now. It was the middle of autumn and rain was pouring down from the sky. The forest floor was littered with branches. Agatha was surrounded by ten other witches.</p><p>She hadn’t faced as many opponents as this before. Still, she wasn’t scared. She had more experience with magic than half these witches combined. She was smart, powerful, and far more capable of controlling her magic than they were. Soon enough, their magic would see that too.</p><p>Besides, losing was not an option, especially now. She had an audience, after all.</p><p>“Pathetic. Is that all you’ve got?” Agatha sneered as the first witch charged her magic at her. “No wonder there’s only so few left of you, you’re not even able to protect yourselves from one lone witch.”</p><p>When she first met the group, one of the witches had told Agatha that just a month ago, half their coven died of a disease that had quickly spread. Agatha had barely reacted, storing that bit of information away for later before returning to what she had been doing: trailing her fingers up the witch’s skirts, making her moan her name over and over and over.</p><p>That little detail came in handy now. The other witches, unable to control their anger, blasted Agatha with their magic all at once.</p><p>Agatha had to give it to them: they were slightly more powerful than she’d anticipated. She stumbled back from the force that hit her, her back harshly connecting with the tree trunk behind her. The rough bark scraped cuts all over her bare arms. But before she had a chance to worry, she already felt her own magic reaching out, ready to absorb whatever they were giving her.</p><p>Slowly, a purple light started surrounding them, and Agatha could feel that familiar sense of euphoria creeping in.</p><p>Soon enough, she was the only one left standing on the damp forest floor. Well, the only witch. After all, there was someone else there.</p><p>“Did you enjoy my performance?” Agatha shouted into thin air.</p><p>Rio appeared almost instantly. A small smile formed on Agatha’s lips before she could help herself.</p><p>“You’re very talented.” Rio’s voice sounded smoother, more honeyed this time. Had she been practicing, just for her?</p><p>“I think you’re the only one who’s ever told me that. Then again, you’re usually the only one left standing after moments like these.”</p><p>“They don’t see what I see.” And oh, there it was again. That familiar <em>want</em>, so similar but different from the way Agatha usually wanted.</p><p>Rio seemed more relaxed this time around. Like now that she knew that Agatha wasn’t going to turn on her, she was willing to let her guard down a bit. Her eyes looked different too. They still held that familiar, all-consuming black at their center, but they were now surrounded by a warmer brown. Agatha couldn’t look away.</p><p>When Rio stepped closer, however, a concerned look appeared in those beautiful new eyes of hers. She grabbed Agatha’s arm, exposing the tiny cuts that littered Agatha’s flesh to the air. The rain was already washing most of the damage away, but some were still bleeding.</p><p>“Are you hurt?”</p><p>“They’re only scratches, I’ll be fine.” Agatha said, defensively. A warmth bloomed in her chest at Rio’s concern, but she ignored it. She didn’t need Rio to think she couldn’t take care of herself.</p><p>“I can help.”</p><p>“I’m perfectly capable of healing–” Agatha’s words caught in her throat when Rio ran her tongue over her wrist. When she pulled away, the cut there had disappeared. “What…”</p><p>But before Agatha could continue her sentence, Rio’s mouth was on her arm again, higher this time, licking over the cuts she found there. The warmth that had blossomed in her chest was travelling lower now, coiling tight in her abdomen.</p><p>“Is this alright?” Rio asked shyly, still hovering over Agatha’s arm, only just now registering how quiet Agatha had become.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything for a moment, before holding her other arm out to Rio. “If you’re offering…” Her voice was low.</p><p>Rio obeyed immediately. She gently grabbed Agatha’s hand and glided her tongue over the skin that was glistening from the blood and the rain, starting at the elbow this time. She worked quietly and diligently, making sure not to miss a single cut. Agatha just watched in awe, pressing her legs together before she realized what she was doing.</p><p>When Rio licked over her wrist, closing up the last cut on her arm, she peered up at Agatha with those deep brown eyes. Agatha’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha’s voice sounded hoarse, even to her own ears.</p><p>“My pleasure.” From anyone else, it would’ve sounded like an innuendo. From Rio, it felt like a promise. When Rio pulled away, it was like Agatha could finally feel the cold rain on her skin – and Agatha hated how empty she suddenly felt.  </p><p>Then Rio took another step back, and Agatha knew she was getting ready to disappear again. Before she could fade out completely, Agatha spoke.</p><p>“Don’t make me wait too long this time.”</p><p>“Okay, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept her promise. At most, two weeks would pass without seeing each other, and only if Rio was especially busy. When Agatha had asked her about it during one of their visits, Rio had told her she was responsible for carrying souls to the next plane.</p><p>“To heaven, you mean?” They were lying in a grass field, the sun beating down on their faces.</p><p>“I don’t know. I just take them to the entrance, I can’t follow them.”</p><p>“That must be lonely. Aren’t there others like you that you can talk to?”</p><p>Rio got quiet, shaking her head. Then, in a small voice, she added, “I talk to you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t know what to say. Instead, she grabbed Rio’s hand and entwined their fingers. Her mark was burning in the exact spots where it touched Rio’s skin. She wondered if Rio could feel it too.</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>After finding out Rio could heal her wounds, Agatha grew even more reckless in her pursuit of power. It was addictive. Not just the power, but the feeling of having someone at your beck and call to clean you up after a fight.</p><p>Another thing that became addictive very quickly was the feeling of Rio’s tongue on her bare skin. The novelty never wore off; any cut, scrape or scratch, and Rio would be there, already lapping up the blood.</p><p>Last time they saw each other, Agatha had had a cut on her finger. It wasn’t even from taking someone’s magic: she’d just cut herself preparing some vegetables. The bleeding had already stopped. Still, Rio had taken the finger into her mouth as soon as she saw the small wound. It had taken everything in Agatha’s power to suppress a groan at the feeling of Rio’s mouth wrapped around the digit, her mind reeling with the images of Rio nipping and sucking in other places.</p><p>Rio had had to leave in a hurry after that, mentioning something about souls that were waiting for her services. She’d sounded just as flustered as Agatha had felt.</p><p>So, when she felt that all-familiar burn in her mark that told her Rio was about to visit, who could blame her for being a little overexcited?</p><p>Agatha was walking through the village market, preparing to go into the woods and picking up some fruit on the way. Rio didn’t need to eat, but she’d learned to enjoy it, as long as she could share with Agatha.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t wait to get far away from any prying eyes. Logically, she knew that Rio asked her to meet in private because seeing a real-life angel in the flesh would shock the townspeople, but secretly, Agatha hoped a small part of it was the fact that she wanted her all to herself.</p><p>Suddenly, her thoughts were interrupted by a voice.</p><p>“Sarah told me what you did. Together.”</p><p>A woman was walking towards Agatha, a thunderous expression on her face. Agatha recognized her vaguely. Maeve? Mary? Something starting with an M, surely.</p><p>“Who’s Sarah?” she asked, playing dumb. In all fairness, she truly didn’t remember a Sarah either, though she could guess what had made M-whatever so upset. She was standing in front of Agatha now, blocking her path into the woods.</p><p>“Fuck you, Agatha.” And before Agatha could register what was happening, the woman punched her square in the face and quickly stormed off, giving her no chance to react.</p><p>The woman was strong, too. One gentle press from her fingers to her mouth told her that her lips were going to be swollen tomorrow.</p><p>Still, she couldn’t let herself get sidetracked. Agatha had more important things to do. She continued her path to the woods.</p><p>As soon as she walked into the clearing, she saw Rio already standing there, her back turned, still unaware of Agatha’s presence. Agatha took a moment to just admire her. Each time she saw Rio, she appeared softer, somehow. Her eyes had settled into that hazel brown color that Agatha was starting to love. Her dresses had gotten brighter too, favoring a green color that contrasted perfectly with Agatha’s preferred purple. Agatha bit her lip at the sight.</p><p>“Ow, <em>fuck</em>.”</p><p>Rio turned around when she heard the sound, finding Agatha pressing her finger to her lip. Her lip that was now bleeding. Rio immediately rushed to her side.</p><p>“What happened?” Rio’s voice was full of concern.</p><p>“I’m fine.” Agatha ran her tongue over the spot where she was bleeding, ignoring the way Rio’s eyes were seemingly stuck on her lips, her tongue. “Women, right?” she joked, motioning for Rio to sit down with her.</p><p>Rio finally looked up. “I wouldn’t know.”</p><p>“Oh. Right. Sorry.” A thousand questions were going through Agatha’s mind, but Rio spoke up first.</p><p>“What does it feel like?” Rio’s voice was small, but curious in the same way it had been when she’d asked Agatha to tell her about other human activities such as sleeping and eating.</p><p>“The cut? I can barely feel it, don’t worry.”</p><p>“No, I meant– sometimes I see you with other people. Women. You’re touching, and it seems…” A blush is creeping up Rio’s cheeks. “…Pleasurable. What is it like?”</p><p>Agatha barely registered the question. Her mind was stuck on something else, mainly the fact that Rio had just admitted that she’d <em>watched</em> Agatha. While she was… intimate. With other women. Agatha shivered, feeling a molten heat settle between her legs.</p><p>Then, she remembered that Rio was still waiting for an answer.</p><p>“It’s… well, it feels like you’re on fire, but in the best way. Like the only thing that can stop you from burning up is the touch of another person. And it’s the same for them.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio’s eyes were on Agatha’s lips again.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart was hammering in her chest. “Would you heal this cut for me?” she asked, pouting slightly.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up, and Agatha was greeted by that familiar pitch black color. Her iris had almost completely disappeared.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio asked, already moving closer, her breath already ghosting over Agatha’s lips. Both of their chests were rising and falling rapidly.</p><p>
<em>“Please.” </em>
</p><p>That was all it took for Rio to move closer and run the tip of her tongue over the cut. Agathe let out a small gasp at the contact. Then Rio closed her lips over the cut, and Agatha moaned.</p><p>As with all things, Rio worked quickly, diligently, and most of all, thoroughly. Agatha’s mind had only just caught on to the fact that they were, essentially, making out under a tree in the forest and that she should probably respond, when Rio was already moving back again. The faint taste of copper lingered on her lips. It wasn’t an entirely unpleasant taste.</p><p>“There you go. All healed,” Rio murmured, a string of saliva still connecting their lips.</p><p>The thought of this feeling being over so soon broke something in Agatha. So, when she saw Rio’s tongue dart out to lick over her bottom lip, she did the only thing she could think of: she chased Rio’s tongue with her own.</p><p>The first time their lips properly met, Agatha let out a groan. Rio responded in kind. Their touches quickly became less gentle, less about tasting the other person and more about consuming them whole. When Agatha licked into Rio’s mouth, the noise Rio let out was so beautiful that Agatha wanted to hear her make it again and again and again.</p><p><em>“Agatha, please,” </em>Rio pleaded, but when Agatha looked into her eyes she could tell that Rio wasn’t sure of the weight of what she was asking for. Agatha could relate. Out of all the girls she’d bedded, none of them had felt like <em>this</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s neck was starting to hurt from the weird angle, so she grabbed Rio’s hips and pulled her into her lap. Rio let her do it, immediately slotting their lips together again. Agatha was quickly becoming addicted to the taste of Rio in her mouth.</p><p>They continued like that for what could have been minutes, hours, or days. Agatha’s lips became swollen, but when Rio carded her hands through her hair and pulled her closer, all thoughts of discomfort left Agatha’s mind. One of her hands had settled on Rio’s hip, in part to keep Rio steady, but also to give herself something to hold onto. The other ran upwards, over Rio’s shoulder blades, continuing its path to the back of her neck.</p><p>Then, Rio’s hips jerked forward and she pulled back with a gasp.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha asked, breathing heavy.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I’m fine,” Rio replied, but her eyes were frantic, scared.</p><p>“Do you want to slow down?” Rio cast her eyes downward, giving Agatha an almost imperceptible nod. Agatha softly pressed her lips against Rio’s. “That’s alright, baby.” The nickname slipped out before she could stop herself. Agatha released her hold on Rio’s hips, allowing her to climb off her lap.</p><p>For a minute they just lay there, allowing their breathing to return back to a normal pace. Their hands rested next to each other, just an inch apart, not quite touching.</p><p>“Does it always feel like that?” Rio asked, hazel eyes peering into Agatha’s baby blues.</p><p>Agatha thought about how best to answer that question, before entwining Rio’s hand with her own. “No, just with you.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio had been close before. Now, they were truly inseparable. Rio visited Agatha every day, always bringing her some kind of gift. Most of the time, she brought flowers. Beautiful bouquets of flowers Agatha had never seen before, their sweet, musky scent always tinged with something unmistakably <em>Rio</em>.</p><p>They’d continued kissing, too. Sometimes it was sweet, soft and slow, lying in a flower field while they were basking in the sunlight. Sometimes it was hurried and frantic, limbs entangled and gasping for breath. They never did anything more than that, though.</p><p>Not for a lack of want on Agatha’s part. No, in the moments that Rio wasn’t there, all she could think about was what she would feel like wrapped around her fingers, her mouth, her tongue. But she wouldn’t push Rio into anything she wasn’t ready to give.</p><p>Agatha allowed herself to become distracted by Rio. Her bouts of luring innocent witches to the woods were becoming less frequent now, though she didn’t stop entirely. It didn’t come close to the feeling of Rio’s arms around her, but stealing other witches’ magic still held its own dark thrill.</p><p>That was how she found herself guiding four witches into the woods with promises of great power, if only they performed a spell together. The group was relatively small and Agatha wasn’t worried. She’d take their power and wait for Rio to show up, allowing them to spend the rest of the evening together.</p><p>Agatha turned her attention to the witches, telling them to hold hands and form a circle. She could already feel her magic brewing at her fingertips, restless and hungry, itching to break free. </p><p>She told the group to chant in Latin, knowing for a fact that what they were saying was nonsense. Frustration permeated the air, the other witches’ voices becoming irritated, wavering. It was time to put on a show.</p><p>“Why isn’t it working? Try harder,” Agatha taunted.</p><p>“We’re doing exactly what you said.”</p><p>“You must be too weak to perform a spell of this caliber. I knew I should’ve found a more talented group of witches.” The witches were no longer holding hands, and she could see magic sparking at their fingertips. “You’re useless.”</p><p>Before she could bend down to pick up her supplies bag, she already felt the cool touch of magic on her skin. One of the witches was blasting a beam of bright blue power straight at her chest. The other’s quickly followed. <em>Finally</em>.</p><p>Agatha was in the middle of draining them when she felt her mark pulse. Rio was close. As soon as the last body dropped to the floor, Rio appeared, wearing a soft smile. Agatha all but ran over to her, when she suddenly stopped.</p><p>The last thing she heard was a loud “Witch!” and a <em>bang</em>, before she dropped to the ground, clutching the side of her thigh. Her hands were immediately coated in the blood that was now pouring out of her.</p><p>When she looked up, vision blurry, she saw the vague outline of a man standing about fifty feet away, holding a gun. Her attention was drawn elsewhere, though.</p><p>Standing between her and the man was Rio, but she looked different. Her eyes had returned to that pitch black color. Her hands were no longer soft but sharp like claws. She was wearing the same black, tattered shroud from the day they met.</p><p>The most remarkable thing, however, were the giant, black wings attached to Rio’s back. They were spread out, making her appear otherworldly. She wasn’t walking as much as gliding across the forest floor, wings dragging heavy behind her. If Agatha were able to make out the expression on the man’s face, she was sure it would be sheer and utter terror. Unlike him, Agatha was in awe.</p><p>She could tell that Rio was talking to the man, but she couldn’t make out the words. Rio’s voice had an unnatural sharpness to it, all the softness Agatha had come to recognize completely gone. She was slipping out of consciousness from the blood loss. The last thing she heard and saw before her eyes closed was a resounding <em>snap</em> of bones, and the man crumpling to the ground.</p><p>When she blinked her eyes open again, Rio was there, cradling her face. There were tears in her eyes.</p><p>“Agatha! Please, tell me you’re okay.” Rio was tearing at Agatha’s dress, removing the laces of her corset with the hand that wasn’t holding her face, the one that was still clawed. Her eyes had returned to their familiar hazel color, but Agatha could still see the large black wings behind her. She couldn’t quite pull her eyes away from them.</p><p>The sight was enough to keep her grounded – until Rio loosened her corset, another gush of blood flowing out of the wound. Her white shift had turned a muddy red.</p><p>Rio lowered herself down, holding Agatha’s leg and inspecting the wound up close. Despite it all, Agatha still gasped when she felt Rio’s hands – now both human again – on her upper thigh. When Rio peered up at her with those stupidly big brown eyes, her heart stopped for a second. There was a question there, one Rio was too afraid to ask out loud.</p><p>Agatha understood, and nodded.</p><p>Immediately, Rio’s lips latched onto the wound, licking at the blood that was still flowing from its center. It hurt for only a moment, but then Agatha felt the familiar ebbing of the pain, Rio’s tongue now soothing rather than hurting. Up until now, Rio’s healing had mostly confined itself to relatively innocuous places. Her arms, her fingers, her lips – Agatha shuddered at the memory.</p><p>But now, with Rio’s tongue inching ever closer to where she ached for her, Agatha could barely contain herself. When Rio’s hand moved higher up her thigh, trying to get a better grip, getting closer to her heat, her hips jerked and she let out a gasp.</p><p>Rio peered up at Agatha from her thighs. Agatha was struck by the sight. Rio’s irises were almost completely covered by her huge, black pupils. There was a hunger in them that could barely be contained. Her mouth and chin were covered in Agatha’s blood. And in that moment, Agatha thought the exact same thing she had though when she first saw Rio: <em>she’s beautiful</em>.</p><p>“Are you okay, my love?” asked Rio in a soft whisper.</p><p><em>My love</em>. The words hit harder than any gunshot could.</p><p>Rio had never called her that before. Even without Rio’s tongue, she was sure that phrase would’ve healed her pain right away. When she nodded dumbly, Rio returned to what she was doing.</p><p>Now that her wound was gradually closing in on itself, the pain slowly disappearing into the background with every lick of Rio’s tongue, another feeling tightened itself in Agatha’s gut: raw, aching <em>want</em>.</p><p>She fought the urge to move. She kept her hips firmly locked in place, allowing Rio to clean her wound up, as thoroughly as she always did. But when Rio’s teeth accidentally scraped across her inner thigh, she jerked upwards.</p><p>
<em>“Ah.” </em>
</p><p>“What is it, my love?” Rio, her sweet, innocent creature, was gazing up at Agatha with concern in her eyes. “Did I hurt you?”</p><p>“No, no, I just–” Rio resumed her licking at Agatha’s reassurance, making sure every last trail of blood was gone. However, when she nipped at Agatha’s thigh, Agatha couldn’t stop herself.</p><p>
<em>“Fuck, do that again.”</em>
</p><p>Rio stilled. “Oh.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, you don’t have to–”</p><p>But now Rio’s look had changed from one of concern to one of curiosity. She slowly pushed Agatha’s dress up further, taking her shift with it.</p><p>When Agatha’s core was exposed to the open air, she shivered at the cold. Rio lowered her head once more, looking up at Agatha again. Then, she dipped her head lower, dragging her tongue through Agatha’s slick heat in one slow stroke.  </p><p><em>“Fuck.” </em>Agatha arched her back, hips chasing Rio’s mouth. Her hands found its way to Rio’s hair, tugging, guiding, soft but desperate for more.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure why she had been nervous about this. Rio licked at her the same way she licked her wounds: thoroughly. Now that she had Agatha’s permission, it was as if nothing could stop her.</p><p>“Rio, right– <em>God</em>, right there,” Agatha moaned as Rio wrapped her lips around her clit, sucking experimentally. Rio preened under the attention, setting a pattern of nipping, licking, and sucking that had a steady heat build in Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>Rio was attentive; it was as if she was cataloguing every sound Agatha made and using it to pull those same sounds from her again and again, louder, <em>whinier</em>. Her tongue lapped slowly through Agatha’s folds, overwhelming and not nearly enough at the same time.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head back, allowed the feelings to wash over her. The flick of Rio’s tongue, every sweet, messy sound she made – it made her heart stutter in her chest.</p><p>Maybe it was the blood loss, or maybe it was how long she’d waiting for this, but Agatha’s orgasm was approaching far quicker than she was used to. Rio was making such beautiful noises against her, and the vibrations went straight to her clit.</p><p>For a second, she imagined what they would look like to a stranger walking by. Agatha, splayed out, dress pushed up to her stomach and stained with dried blood, getting worshipped by a creature with beautiful black eyes, black hair, and large, black wings attached to her back. They’d probably faint on the spot.</p><p>One particularly pointed lick from Rio brought her back to the present, and Agatha could feel that she was about to break. Her hips were moving on their own accord, resisting even Rio’s strong grip. The noises that were falling from her mouth were obscene. Her fists tangled in Rio’s hair, not guiding anymore – just clinging, trying to tether herself.</p><p>“Rio– <em>fuck</em>, Rio, I’m–”</p><p>And then, with one sharp suck on her clit, Agatha fell apart. The pleasure crashed over her in waves, hips bucking up into Rio’s mouth. She rode her orgasm out on Rio’s tongue, who didn’t seem intent on stopping anytime soon. She continued eating her out, until the heat turned into discomfort.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said gently, guiding Rio’s cheek to look up at her. Rio’s mouth was covered in her arousal and the last remains of her blood.</p><p>Just the sight of it caused another gush of come to leak out of Agatha.</p><p>“Can I make you do that again?” Rio asked before Agatha could say anything. It sounded so pure, so innocent, that any thought of stopping immediately went out the window. Agatha should at least give Rio the honor of trying, shouldn’t she?</p><p>When Agatha nodded Rio repositioned herself, laying down with one of Agatha’s thighs between her own. With a shock, Agatha realized that Rio was wet, too. <em>Dripping,</em> actually. Before she could even think to do anything about it, Rio’s mouth was already back on her.</p><p>At the first contact of Rio’s tongue with her cunt, Agatha let out a sigh. She’d never tire of this feeling, she was sure of it. Rio’s wings were still spread around them, cocooning them in their own little bubble of pleasure.</p><p>Her second orgasm was already building in her stomach when she felt a single digit slide through her folds. She moaned, opening her eyes to look at Rio, who was already staring at her intently. Her eyes were holding that same question they’d been holding all day: <em>Can I?</em></p><p>Agatha had never felt as greedy for something as she had now. Instead of telling Rio, she grabbed her wrist and leaned forward, guiding Rio’s fingers through her folds. Then, she took the fingers and brought them to her mouth, sucking the slick off of them. Rio’s hips bucked into her kneecap.</p><p>She slowly guided the fingers downwards again, towards her entrance.</p><p>“Go ahead,” was all it took for Rio to start moving again.</p><p>She started pumping her fingers in and out of Agatha, slowly at first, trying to watch for Agatha’s reactions. Rio was a quick learner: she angled and curled her fingers just so, making sure that Agatha was just moments away from her orgasm after only a few seconds.</p><p>With her fingers driving into Agatha, Rio couldn’t stop her mouth from talking. Phrases like <em>fuck </em>and <em>more</em> and <em>you taste so good </em>were leaving Rio’s mouth on a loop between licks. Her hips had starting moving in time with her fingers, grinding herself on Agatha’s knee. Agatha was pretty sure Rio wasn’t even aware she was doing it.</p><p>Experimentally, she lifted her knee. She was immediately met with a loud moan from Rio, who was pushing her core deeper into the hard lines of Agatha’s body, still never losing the rhythmic pace she’d set with her fingers.</p><p>When Rio curled her fingers into that spongy spot that made Agatha see stars, she lifted her knee again.</p><p>
<em>“Agatha.”</em>
</p><p>Rio was fully humping Agatha now, and Agatha could not be more delighted. If her own orgasm wasn’t so quickly approaching, she’d roll Rio on her back and have her way with her. As it was, all she could do was guide Rio.</p><p>Rio’s mouth had found its way back to her clit, her fingers still pumping into her in time with her thrusts. “Take your pleasure,” Agatha cooed, moving her knee in time with Rio’s thrusts.</p><p>Rio moaned, her hips starting to stutter. Agatha’s walls had started to flutter too, clamping down on Rio’s fingers.</p><p>“Go on, you can do it.”</p><p><em>“Fuck,” </em>Rio groaned. Her control was visibly slipping.</p><p>“Come on, baby. Come for me.”</p><p>Rio fell apart. Agatha could feel Rio’s release coating her thigh and with one final thrust of Rio’s fingers, she followed Rio into orgasm.</p><p>They lay tangled together, shivering through the aftershocks, panting against each other. When Agatha cradled Rio’s face once again she immediately moved up into her lap, kissing Agatha softly. Agatha could taste herself – her sweat, her blood, her release – on Rio’s lips. She moaned at the flavor.</p><p>When Rio finally pulled back, Agatha looked at her with a bemused expression.</p><p>“When were you going to tell me about these?” She nodded her head towards Rio’s wings, now folded neatly beneath her back. Curious, she trailed her fingers through the silky softness of the feathers. Rio’s hips jerked forward, letting out a low moan. <em>Interesting</em>.</p><p>“They’re… sensitive,” Rio panted, hips twitching helplessly beneath her.</p><p>Suddenly, a few things were starting to make sense. Namely, why Rio had reacted the way she did when Agatha had ran her hands over her back when they shared their first kiss. Or why she preferred to be the big spoon when they were lying together, her front pressed to Agatha’s back instead of the other way around.</p><p>“Are they now?” Agatha ran her fingers over the wings again, slower this time. Rio bucked her hips as if on command. “Then why’d you decide to show them today?”</p><p> “I can’t always–” Rio groaned when Agatha stroked over her wings again. “–control it.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Aw, don’t worry, baby. It happens to the best of us.”</p><p>Rio looked at her with an embarrassed expression on her face, like she knew Agatha was poking fun at her but wasn’t quite sure how. Then, she shuddered.</p><p>Agatha had moved on to the tips of Rio’s wings, twirling a feather around her finger, while her other hand found its way between Rio’s thighs. She stroked over Rio’s entrance with her middle finger.</p><p>“I figure, you gave me two orgasms, and you only had one. So I still owe you.” Agatha ran her middle fingers through Rio’s folds again. Her expression was teasing, but her eyes were open, earnest. If Rio wanted to stop, she would only have to say so.</p><p>What she said instead was, “Okay, Agatha.”</p><p>“‘Okay’? Care to be a little more enthusiastic than that, baby?” Agatha dragged her palm in slow, deliberate pressure over Rio’s clit, even as her other hand stroked lazy patterns over her wings. Rio’s head fell forward, moaning into Agatha’s ear.</p><p><em>“Please.” </em>Agatha had barely touched Rio, and she already sounded wrecked. She ran her hand over Rio’s feathers again, curling her fingers into Rio at the same time. She met no resistance: the remains of Rio’s first orgasm and a new, fresh wave of arousal coated Agatha’s fingers at the first touch.</p><p>With Rio now moaning into her neck, she took the opportunity to whisper sweet nothings into Rio’s ear.</p><p>“You look so beautiful, all spread out on my fingers.” Agatha curled her fingers again, palm grinding harshly against Rio’s clit. “I can’t wait to feel you fall apart for me.”</p><p>Agatha pressed open-mouthed kisses down the curve of Rio’s neck, tasting the salt of her skin as Rio leaned helplessly into her. The hand that wasn’t trapped between Rio’s legs was still stroking over her wings, tracing nonsensical patterns. </p><p>“Been thinking about it for so long, too…” Agatha could already feel Rio’s walls clenching around her. “Do you want that, Rio? To come for me again?”</p><p>Rio’s voice almost sounded watery when she said, “Yes, <em>please</em>.” Her hips were moving fast in a desperate, unsteady rhythm.</p><p>Agatha curled her fingers in time with Rio’s thrusts while her fingers continued playing with the feathers on Rio’s wings. Rio’s eyes were glazed over, forehead dropped into the crook of Agatha’s neck. Agatha trailed her hand from the thick base of the wings to the silky, tapered ends. Every time she moved downwards, Rio shuddered – involuntarily, like she had no control over her body.</p><p>“You’re so wet,” Agatha murmured, her voice sounding almost reverent. “I barely have to move.” And yet, she did continue to move, allowing herself to enjoy the way Rio was clenching around her. She was panting now, every breath coming out as a moan.</p><p>“More,” Rio whimpered, her thighs trembling on either side of Agatha’s lap. “Don’t stop, don’t stop– <em>please</em>, keep going.”</p><p>Agatha adjusted her angle to get her fingers to reach deeper, further into Rio’s aching core. She was rewarded with a sharp cry.</p><p>“Like that, hm?” Agatha said with a grin, grazing her teeth along the shell of Rio’s ear. “You look so beautiful like this, baby.”</p><p>“I– I can’t–” Rio gasped as Agatha curled her fingers once more and applied pressure to her clit by pushing her palm forwards.</p><p>“You’re trembling,” Agatha whispered as Rio’s head fell back, wings fluttering ever so slightly. And in that moment, Agatha couldn’t stop herself. She moved her mouth to the side and pressed her lips to the base of one of Rio’s wings at the same time she curled her fingers.</p><p>Rio screamed.</p><p>Not in pain, but in pure, breathless ecstasy. Her whole body clenched around Agatha’s fingers, slick gushing out of her in a sudden burst. Agatha’s lap was soaked in an instant. She looked down, half in shock and half in complete awe.</p><p>“You weren’t lying about them being sensitive.”</p><p>“What did I…?” Rio looked down at herself, taken aback at the wetness she found there. Agatha pressed a quick kiss below her ear.</p><p>“It’s not a bad thing, don’t worry. Just means I did a <em>really </em>good job,” Agatha said, smirk on her face. Rio couldn’t help but smile too, her body falling limply against Agatha’s.</p><p>They lay there for a few minutes. Then, Rio closed her eyes and – with a concentrated effort – her wings started to disappear. Agatha’s hands immediately found the tender places where Rio’s feathers had sprouted from, her palms molding over the lingering heat of their absence. Rio let out a groan.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Don’t tell me this is the last time I’ll see them?” Agatha’s tone was light, but she couldn’t stop a small bit of desperation from seeping in.</p><p>“I just told you I can’t always control when they come out, and you think this is the last time you’ve seen them? If there’s anything I know, it’s that I’ll always feel a little out of control around you.”</p><p>When Agatha looked into Rio’s eyes again, her expression was earnest and a little scared. “In a good way, I hope?”</p><p>Rio finally rolled herself off of Agatha’s lap and pushed her to lie down on her side, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s back. They should get cleaned up soon, wash off the fluids and sweat coating their skin. For now, though, Agatha just wanted to lay there for a while.</p><p>“In the best way.”</p>
