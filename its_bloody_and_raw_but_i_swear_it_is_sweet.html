<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“I don’t believe you. You prefer me—“</p><p>“Compliant?” Rio stood slowly, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s face. The action put her inches away, her body heat radiating out, searing Agatha’s skin. “Obedient?”</p><p>Agatha’s hips shifted against her will, her lips parting slightly. She closed her eyes against the heady mortification that razed through her chest. She felt Rio move closer and she parted her legs without thought.</p><p>Rio stepped between them but didn’t touch, hands settling on the desk inches from Agatha’s hips and hands.</p><p>“You always were such a <i>brat</i>.” Rio’s breath was hot against Agatha’s ear, her voice throaty and raw and filthy. “You never knew how to do what you were told.”</p><p>Or: After five years away, a still-grieving Agatha is dragged back into the FBI and the arms of her ex-wife.</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha slumped back in her chair, eyes on the cluttered board in front of her as she tried to piece together a puzzle without all its pieces.</p><p>She was tired. Her eyes burned against the overhead fluorescents and her skin was dry from the harsh air conditioning that never ceased to pump musky air into the building.</p><p>She was the last one in the precinct, not an abnormality.</p><p>She was the last one privy to the details of this case due to a two-day suspension without pay. Irritating.</p><p>Her colleagues had been working on this for a week, their efforts perfectly organized on the whiteboard centered in the middle of the room. Useless buffoons.</p><p>Agatha tapped her fingers on the edge of the pleather armrest, stopping after her fingers found a loose bit of fabric. She tugged at it idly, staring into the dead eyes of a man with no family, no property, no name; it didn’t make sense.</p><p>She studied the strange pool of blood under his body, too large to come from a single stab wound on his chest that was nowhere near his heart. It didn’t make sense, the immediate gush of blood didn’t look to have reached even the back of his shirt. The blood that stained his back was patchy at best. The working theory was that he’d fallen face-down and had later been flipped. For what? Something in his pockets?</p><p>Agatha grimaced. Her eyes slipped to the multiple pairs of footprints pulled from around the house where his body had been discovered. There were dozens; different sizes and shapes that were likely using the abandoned home as a place to light up or shoot up. Of the freshest, one pair gave Agatha pause.</p><p>They were heels. Tall too if the indents left gave any indication. That wasn’t her area of expertise and they still hadn’t gotten any report from the forensics team.</p><p>Why they would have walked through the grass is beyond her when the home’s sidewalk still functioned as such, hardly covered by weeds.</p><p>Agatha pushed herself up and trudged over to the board, eyes looking at the heel prints. They weren’t. . . stable. That much was clear. The gait was uneven and seemed. . .</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened, a smug smirk turning her lips as she began to dismember the board picture by picture. She erased everything and began to remake it.</p><p>By the end, it looked far worse; sloppy handwriting, lazy application of symmetry and good organizational techniques, but she was right and that was what mattered.</p><p>Tomorrow or the next day, her theory would become fact once the blood samples were revealed to be multiple victims’ DNA.</p><p>She picked up a dry erase marker and squeaked out a final note to the remainder of her team.</p><p>
<i>Morons</i>
</p><p>Agatha left the station without fanfare and headed for the closest bar.</p><p>—————</p><p>The next morning started as expected. Simmering outrage restricted only by their wounded pride, the other members of Agatha’s team glared at her.</p><p>Her head pounded from her lack of sleep and the four to nine Dos Equis she’d consumed in the span of the night. She’d gone home alone at last call with a peaceful numbness sitting on her breastbone and a glimmer of hope that maybe it would carry her through the next day.</p><p>It was always a false hope.</p><p>Agatha ignored the looks as she sat in her worn jeans and frumpy flannel, the sleeves rolled up to her elbows. A part of her, long lost, grated at the undignified image she painted for the world. But that woman had been crushed under the heel of one too many losses. The Agatha that remained would not be convinced to care that her shirt wasn’t buttoned through the right holes or that her jeans were starting to fray at the knees and hems.</p><p>She collapsed in her desk chair and waited for the call.</p><p>“Detective Harkness. My office.”</p><p>Agatha stood, her eyes rolling across the office and watching eyes dart away from her gaze. She huffed a mocking laugh and took her time walking to the Chiefs’ office. That included making herself a coffee on the way and his eyes fell to the steaming cup in her hands as she entered.</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Save it, Chief. We all know I’m right. You’ll see it soon even if your brain can’t wrap around it now.”</p><p>He’d never known what to do with her. He was soft, an “empathetic leader” he had once called himself. Agatha had laughed in a room filled with her colleagues and select members of the press.</p><p>It hadn’t started them off on the best course and she had blasted through every one of his attempts to right the ship. Agatha had wondered when his patience would snap. She was almost impressed with his self-control until she discovered that Chief Jones was simply weak. A weak will, a weak constitution, an inability to show up to work without a stain down the front of his perfectly pressed shirts.</p><p>Agatha hated him.</p><p>Chief Jones pinched the bridge of his nose, his eyes squeezed tight.</p><p>“Agatha. I’ve really tried with you. I’ve kept you on despite the complaints of my other detectives. I’ve overlooked all of your insubordination and frankly rude behavior because you are good at your job–”</p><p>“The best. The only thing those cucks might succeed at is watching me fuck their unhappy wives.”</p><p>The Chief ignored her interruption, grimacing through the crassness of it.</p><p>“You asked me to screen the calls from the FBI. I did so. I said that we needed you here.”</p><p>Agatha’s body went cold, her eyes locking into the guilt already present in her Chief’s. She’d told him that she would not accept any contact from her old team or, god forbid, a new one, and he’d happily agreed. She gripped the chair arms tightly as the headache became a distinct nausea born from terror.</p><p>Chief Jones sighed.</p><p>“But we don’t. We don’t need you here. You make the jobs of my other detectives harder. We cannot work as a team; there is no trust. You are the reason I cannot make this precinct a family.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to puke all over his white starched shirt. She seethed.</p><p>“The reason you cannot make this team a family is due to your lack of anything resembling a spine.”</p><p>Chief Jones didn’t raise to the bait and Agatha was reeling with rage. He was a simpleton and a coward and Agatha <i>hated</i> him.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“Pack your things, Agatha. The transfer request that came through was marked as mandatory and you’ve given me no reason to fight it. They expect you in DC next Monday.”</p><p>Agatha stood and she clenched her shaking hands to hide them.</p><p>“Tell them they can kick rocks.” She stalked toward the door. “Enjoy mediocrity. I hope it kills you.”</p><p>Agatha slammed the Chief’s door, the wood and blinds clacking and drawing the attention of the room as she made her way to her desk. There was nothing to pack, no personal items beyond the coffee mug in her hands and a now-dead plant given to her by the Chief that sat on her desk corner. He’d provided a small plant to all of his Detectives on his first day. Agatha’s had shriveled into nothingness and she’d left it there as a reminder to Jones and her department that they meant nothing to her.</p><p>Agatha dumped her remaining coffee in the mesh trash can by her desk and barely felt any joy as it flooded out across the floor. Murmurs started amongst the detectives and Agatha wouldn’t admit it but a rash singe of shame branded her chest. She dropped her badge and service weapon and looked up at the Detectives around her. None looked away this time, holding expressions of smug glee and relief that the ‘Wicked Witch’ of the 120th NYPD Precinct was no more.</p><p>Agatha felt the curling grin on her face and knew they would not see her fall apart. Apathy held her like a snug coat and it would not fail her now.</p><p>“I’d say it was a pleasure but fortunately you’ve never given that to any woman.”</p><p>Agatha stood tall through every emotion, long ignored, knocking hurriedly at her door. She left the precinct and felt the sharp wind of Fall cutting across her arms and cheeks. Coffee cup dangling from her fingers, Agatha mechanically made her way home to her small, dingy apartment. It was dark and bare. Not much sat in the living room beyond a single, ugly, patterned couch that had once been vibrant and was now muted and graying. A dusty record was set on a similarly unused bookshelf in the corner. The shelves were empty and the records, once well-loved, lay untouched in a wicker basket on the floor.</p><p>Agatha’s bedroom wasn’t any more personal. A full bed with gray sheets and pillows that lay flat against the short wooden headboard. No photos sat on the walls and the only color in the room was a quilt that covered the dreary sheets of her bed. It was her treasure and greatest agony, purple and white and gold patterned squares with cross-stitched pictures that told a sweet, perfect, silly story of a boy who became a superhero.</p><p>Agatha often slept on the couch when the sight of it aimed to cripple her.</p><p>Now, she stood staring, eyes wet with fury and frustration and guilt, and her dormant heart roared in her chest and clattered against her sternum.</p><p>Her throat closed up and her lungs burned and she tore her gaze from her greatest failure to the table beside her bed. She pulled out a bottle of cheap Whiskey and drank it straight, focusing on the sear of it down her throat.</p><p>Agatha knew sleep would bring nightmares and so she dropped onto her couch and drank. Her mind slipped toward the past with desperation and she fought for a distraction with every breath.</p><p>But her life was empty. It held no meaning or warmth or joy. Instead of helping, instead of the usual numb buzz, the Whiskey made her enervated will falter.</p><p>Blue eyes so closely matched to her own blinked in her mind with the soft innocence of youth. Curly, brown hair and pink, chubby cheeks. A gap-filled smile that let out her favorite sound; a squealing giggle that haunted her and turned to screams in her sleep.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and she cried. It was quiet, no loud sob to distract her from the tragedy of her life laid bare before her. She dropped the bottle on the floor, not caring if it spilled, and wondered how good it would feel to fall asleep and never wake up again.</p><p>Her dark musings were interrupted by the buzzing in her pocket. She blinked, the room blurry as she pulled out her phone and squinted at the screen. Her breath, shallow before, ceased entirely.</p><p>After the failure of her marriage and then her life, Agatha had been driven by despair and bitterness. She’d changed her ex-wife’s contact to a skull and thought that time might piece together her fractured heart. Instead, despair settled in to stay and her bitterness faded into apathy so consuming that she wasn’t sure she’d ever overcome it.</p><p>Now, the skull stared back at her with alarming clarity. Dread cratered Agatha’s chest and she held the power button on her phone until the screen went black.</p><p>Relief lasted all of a second before a knock came at her door, the pattern so familiar that Agatha considered throwing herself from her third floor window. She’d probably survive.</p><p>There was no way <i>She</i> had come <i>here.</i></p><p>Agatha didn’t move or breathe in hopes that the vile demon on her doorstep would pass her by.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>The sing-song, smug lilt that carried her name through the door had Agatha’s hair standing on end. She grit her teeth, looking around her pathetic apartment. Her eyes locked on the smudged window and she decided it would lead to a less-painful afternoon.</p><p>She’d just stood, boot kicking the whiskey so it rolled across the floor and spilled whatever remained, when she heard the scratch of picks in the lock.</p><p>She’d barely taken a step toward the window when the whine of her front door sounded behind her. She heard her past step over the threshold and plant itself firmly back into her life like it wouldn’t absolutely destroy her.</p><p>“Nice digs.”</p><p>Agatha saw red. She spun, her rage steamrolling any other emotion that may have taken precedence when facing her ex-wife for the first time in three years.</p><p>“Get. Out.”</p><p>Rio frowned, eyes tracing across Agatha from the messy, low pony to the scuffed boots she hadn’t taken off. She did not seem inclined to listen to Agatha’s vitriolic command. Instead, she met Agatha’s eyes, raised a single one of her brows, and began to circle the room toward the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha just watched, jaw clenched, tears still wet on her cheeks, fury roiling in her chest, as Rio studied her fall from grace like it was a crime scene to be picked apart.</p><p>Rio peered into the kitchen.</p><p>“A bit sparse on the decorations. It’s October.”</p><p>Agatha fought to keep her anger from slipping away even as Rio ignored it. Whatever would come after it could not do so in the presence of her ex-wife.</p><p>“Nothing to celebrate.”</p><p>She was glad her words were solid and sharp despite the Whiskey and the unkempt feelings in her body.</p><p>Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Fall was your favorite.”</p><p>The knowing, casual way the words left Rio’s lips had Agatha’s shoulders sagging.</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about it.”</p><p>Rio looked back at her, studied her, and faced her.</p><p>“So talk about your plans to return to DC.”</p><p>Agatha slowly bent down to pick up the whiskey from where it lay near-empty by the basket of vinyls. She set it upright and lifted the basket to keep the liquor puddled everywhere from staining the sleeves.</p><p>“I’m not going to DC.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the kitchen archway and watched. She said nothing as Agatha used the bottom of her flannel to wipe the whiskey from the bottom of the basket. She said nothing when Agatha pulled the flannel off and used it like a paper towel, spreading the whiskey across the floor in an attempt to clean it up.</p><p>Soon, Agatha ran out of tasks she could complete and she stared at the still-soggy floor until she couldn’t anymore. Her face lifted, gaze falling on Rio, and really looked at her for the first time since she’d stepped into Agatha’s shitty, little apartment.</p><p>Rio Vidal had had a hold on Agatha from the moment they’d met. It had never been subtle or coy for them, never quiet. Rio was numinous. She was strange and powerful and perfectly content to let the world fall around her as it may. She had never once felt the pressures of their time at Quantico, never faltered in the face of tough decisions as a field agent, never second-guessed the connection between herself and Agatha.</p><p>Agatha noted the slim, black suit jacket and sinfully unbuttoned white shirt. She tried to ignore the way the cut of the pants shaped perfectly around Rio’s ass and only partially succeeded.</p><p>In another life, Rio Vidal in this suit would have brought Agatha to her knees.</p><p>Now it just made her angry. She rooted out the affection that had sprouted in her chest and crushed the life from it.</p><p>“If that’s all, you can see yourself out.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, her expression flickering to annoyance for the first time since she’d invaded Agatha’s space.</p><p><i>That</i> Agatha could manage. She waited for Rio to speak, eager to pick a fight.</p><p>But Rio just shrugged.</p><p>“That’s fine. I’m sure there won’t be any repercussions to the contract you signed to get here.”</p><p>“That was coerced. They wanted to keep their best agent on the line.”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“Yes. And they’re calling to collect.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and it was lifeless and humorless and empty. She kicked the sopping flannel on the ground into the corner.</p><p>“That agent is dead. Why would they risk bringing back whatever’s left?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Agatha felt the warbling high that always came from silencing her ex-wife rear its head. It was quickly stamped out by the feel of a warm hand on her shoulder gripping too tightly and swinging her around.</p><p>Agatha reacted without thought, teeth bared as she caught Rio’s hand and twisted it from her body. But Agatha was buzzed and out of practice and Rio had always been able to predict her.</p><p>Agatha found her attempt to dislodge Rio’s hand used against her as Rio slid behind her and wrapped her own arm around Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Agatha stilled, her eyes squeezed shut and her head falling back on Rio’s shoulder as she tried to ignore the onslaught of everything she’d once been so familiar with.</p><p>Rio’s touch, her scent, the way their bodies were so familiar with one another even after years.</p><p>Rio didn’t wait for Agatha to gather herself.</p><p>“Is this really how you see yourself? A bitter, self-loathing detective intent to waste her life away one bottle at a time? A shitty CBS procedural with a poorly written, pathetic female lead?” Rio’s breath was hot on her cheek. “I don’t have time for your pity party, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha slammed her chin down, sliding it between Rio’s arm and her own neck. She bit down hard, her teeth drying on the gabardine as she locked them around Rio’s arm.</p><p>Rio yanked her arm back with a pained grunt, shoving at Agatha and sending her into the door that led to her room.</p><p>It gave under her weight, the latch never having worked, and Agatha stumbled before catching herself on the edge of the bed. The quilt was soft under her fingers and Agatha felt the sob crawl up her throat and die, the ache so violent she couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Rio’s footsteps sounded and stilled. Seconds passed, then a minute, before Rio’s breathless, strained voice cracked the dam in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“You have Nicky’s quilt?”</p><p>Agatha felt the coil of guilt around her neck like a noose and she slowly straightened, her hand falling from the quilt and back at her side. She turned slowly.</p><p>Rio looked stricken, her eyes locked onto the colorful pattern of the quilt that covered Agatha’s bed in the same, imperfect, silly way Nicholas had always made his own. The top of it laid over the pillows, the bottom folded under so he could safely tuck his toes away from the floor monsters he was certain hung out beneath his bed.</p><p>Agatha’s heart shattered at the name of their son, at the desperate look in Rio’s eyes that was so rarely seen, at the agonizing loss they had both suffered five years prior. To Agatha it felt like it had been days. It felt like she’d only just received the call, Rio’s broken voice whispering through the phone, Agatha’s world crashing down around her.</p><p>Rio’s expression tightened, the betrayed look in her eyes fading behind a wall of indifference. She walked to Agatha’s closet and pulled out an old suitcase, tossing it on the ground.</p><p>“We’re leaving in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>Agatha didn’t consider the ramifications of being in a car with Rio for the next four and a half hours until she was sitting stonily in the passenger seat of Rio’s agency Tahoe. She’d considered sitting in the back out of spite, but she’d always lost those battles when they were married and she was certain Rio hadn’t become more malleable in their years apart.</p><p>Agatha grimaced out the window, picking apart the past hour in which she’d allowed herself to be dragged back toward her old life. She attested it to guilt- ridiculous- and contemplated vanishing at the next stop for gas.</p><p>“You won’t get far.”</p><p>Agatha stilled and said nothing to the dismissive comment. It was infuriating to be known when she wanted nothing more than to fade into vacant obscurity.</p><p>A memory, once wrapped in love, warmth, and lust, made itself known, the shape of it dancing through her mind and bringing only a deep, tragic ache.</p><p>Agatha had run many times before; that time, her mom had made a reappearance at her doorstep and, instead of amends, she’d implored Agatha to turn from her sinful life and return home to Massachussetes with her. She’d brought letters written by old friends and a series of sermons that Agatha knew without reading were filled with the hatred christians carried and spouted so easily.</p><p>Rio had been behind her in their home, waiting and watching with a blazing intensity Agatha could feel at her back. As it always did, the encounter ended with her mother’s anger, her spittle flying as she condemned Agatha to an eternity of fire. As she always did, Agatha felt herself shrink under the disappointment and abhorrence of the only person in her life that was supposed to love her unconditionally. Agatha had stepped past her mom, broken from the clawed fingers that grabbed at her arms, and climbed into her car. The last thing she’d seen was Rio’s imposing form stepping into Evanora’s face.</p><p>She’d driven for four hours until her car had run out of gas near Virginia Beach. She’d walked to the water, dug her feet into the sand, and somehow, Rio was just there. She’d always been there, always been ready to see Agatha at her absolute worst. She’d made a snarky comment about Agatha being unprepared for a long road trip and then she’d held Agatha while she’d cried and offered to kill her mother.</p><p>Agatha had never loved anyone more than she did Rio. They had spent the day at the beach without any of the necessary equipment. Both had been terribly burnt and covered in sand by the time they’d stumbled into their last-minute hotel reservation.</p><p>Rio had fucked her then, so thorough and insistent that Agatha forgot she even had a mother who hated her.</p><p>Agatha blinked at the dull sky outside and passing traffic and tried not to think about anything at all.</p><p>Rio interrupted.</p><p>“How long have you been living like this?”</p><p>Agatha tensed, forehead pressing against the cool window as she answered.</p><p>“Why don’t we keep this civil, yeah? You shut your mouth and don’t open it again until you’re saying goodbye. You know what, a goodbye isn’t necessary either.”</p><p>Rio chuckled.</p><p>“Not happening. You’re stuck with me and I’m taking my opportunities where I can.”</p><p>Agatha burned and it felt <i>good.</i></p><p>“A conversation requires call and response, darling.”</p><p>It was a low blow, even Agatha might admit it under duress, but she felt more alive than she had in months. If she didn’t destroy this now, she would be ruined.</p><p>Rio’s response was too calm, too certain.</p><p>“You don’t need to speak for me to get answers, Aggie.” Agatha’s face twisted in disgust and Rio pushed on. “Where do you want me to drop you when we get to Washington?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t been back to DC for five years. She’d left with all the pain one person could carry and dumped it and her soul into the void. She hadn’t said goodbye to anyone and she’d ignored any attempt at outreach since. Nobody would be waiting for her.</p><p>“Any motel is fine.”</p><p>“No. Try again.”</p><p>Agatha threw up a hand.</p><p>When she didn’t offer another option, Rio gave her own.</p><p>“I’ll take you to Wanda’s.”</p><p>Agatha all but snarled, looking to Rio for the first time since they left.</p><p>“I will kill us both right now if you even think about it.”</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>“She’s doing well. Desk job now. Her and her husband had twins.”</p><p>Agatha felt the cavernous hole in her chest lodge itself in her throat and she tried to swallow around it.</p><p>“She always had a knack for getting everything she wanted.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer and Agatha was glad. It gave her time to find her breath again.</p><p>The next ten minutes passed in agonizing silence.</p><p>Agatha finally reached toward the console and turned on the radio, the static filling the car somehow better than the silence.</p><p>Rio looked over.</p><p>“You going to find a station?”</p><p>“Anything is better than hearing you breathe.”</p><p>Rio laughed but Agatha saw the way her fingers tightened around the wheel. Instead of letting it become a battle of patience, Rio reached forward and switched to the first station she could find that was playing music.</p><p>Agatha listened, relieved, and thought that was the end of any form of conversation.</p><p>—————</p><p>An hour later, Rio proved her wrong.</p><p>“The 120th precinct had a distinct change to their Crime Clearance Rates starting two years ago.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“About 100 people choke to death on ballpoint pens every year.” At Rio’s unimpressed look, Agatha shrugged. “Oh so we’re not sharing unnecessary data? My bad, I misunderstood the game.”</p><p>Rio suddenly flipped on her blinker and pulled off the highway onto a desolate-looking exit. She said nothing as she swung into the dingy gas station with three out of the five pumps covered in yellow bags.</p><p>Rio parked the car, shut off the ignition, and stepped out of the vehicle without a word to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha opened her own door and walked to the small shop, her boots crunching in the gravel. Metal bells above the door rang as she opened it and the old lady sitting behind the plexiglass screen offered a nod. Agatha ignored her and let her eyes roam the remainder of the store. It didn’t have much; just an assorted collection of snacks and drinks and a tall stack of magazines that looked months to years old.</p><p>Agatha walked toward it, and subsequently, the attendant. She took the magazine off the top of the stack.</p><p>“Turkish Royals.” She snagged the first lighter in the stand. “And this.”</p><p>The attendant rang up her purchases and smiled.</p><p>“Enjoy!”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, walking out as she slapped the pack against her palm a few times. She opened the pack, flipped a cigarette over, and pulled one out to light. She felt the first, perfect drag coat her throat and lungs before the cigarette was yanked from between her lips. In the same breath the pack left her hands and Agatha watched Rio toss both into the closest trash can.</p><p>Agatha turned and headed back toward the store but Rio caught her arm.</p><p>“If you’re gonna kill yourself, do it faster.”</p><p>Agatha offered her a mocking smile.</p><p>“Loan me your gun?”</p><p>Rio dropped her arm and headed back to the car, the tank still filling up. Agatha considered her many options including a quick dumpster dive but decided against it.</p><p>She curled the magazine in her hand and strode back to the car, climbing inside with her now-useless lighter.</p><p>Rio joined her a moment later, her door closing a little harder than necessary.</p><p>Agatha spoke to the window.</p><p>“You cost me fourteen dollars.”</p><p>Rio shoved a hand in her pocket and pulled out a twenty, tossing it into Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“Keep the change.”</p><p>“Bitch.”</p><p>Rio chuckled then, her eyes sliding over to Agatha with too much knowing for Agatha’s comfort.</p><p>“When did you start smoking again?”</p><p>Agatha tried not to look at the soft curve of Rio’s mouth or think about the persistent effort she was making to connect. The effort she’d been making since Agatha left her. Every month, for the first three years, Rio had sent her a letter and a pressed flower.</p><p>She had destroyed the first in a fit of rage, crumbling the delicate, yellow petals and shredding the letter. The agony of their loss had been so fresh and Agatha hadn’t been in her right mind for months. It wasn’t until she’d seen the speckles of yellow spread across her kitchen that she’d begun to sob. She had spent an hour on her knees collecting every piece of petal and placing all of them in a small vial.</p><p>The next had been a clipping of a willow tree. After that was blue Salvia. Agatha had spent the morning bent over herself in anguish. On the first day at the 120th, she’d received her letter with basil. Many of the flowers were an enduring declaration: Pink Camellia, Edelweiss, Heliotrope. None left any less of a brand on Agatha’s heart. She had endured, keeping the letters sealed but safe. The flowers she kept pressed in a leather-bound book with a cover of deep green.</p><p>Then one day, the third anniversary of Nicholas’ death, a letter came that she could not leave sealed. There was a sprig of rosemary inside. On the letter, in Rio’s scratchy handwriting, were the words “To My Heart.” Agatha had taken the day off to cower in the darkness of her bedroom, Nicky’s quilt bunched against her chest, and she had opened the letter with shaking hands and a broken heart.</p><p>
<i>”I went into Nicky’s room for the first time in a year. I missed him so dearly I couldn’t breathe. I wanted something that he had once touched and you were not here.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I think I sat on his bed for hours holding that silly, stuffed rabbit he adored. I miss him so much, Aggie. Sometimes I think I may simply die from the pain of it. Sometimes I think I already have. That I am living an empty life; like I am a puppet being strung through each day with the hope that one day I might cut myself free.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I miss you. I wish I could be there to hold you through–</i>
</p><p>Agatha had stopped reading there, her tears too heavy, the sobs in her throat too consuming, and she’d lay unmoved for the remainder of the day.</p><p>The next day, bereft, she purchased cardstock and a clipping of a butterfly weed.</p><p>She wrote a single word and sent it to the home that had once belonged to both of them.</p><p>The letters had stopped after that and Agatha longed for them as much as she felt relief.</p><p>Now, the box of letters and the book of flowers sat in an unmarked box in Rio’s trunk and Agatha was sat next to a woman who had once been her world. She sucked in a breath, felt the weakness of it, and sighed.</p><p>“I don’t smoke.”</p><p>It was an admission as much as an end to the conversation and she felt Rio’s eyes on her for minutes after.</p><p>_________</p><p>They were an hour outside of town, the only sound being the classic rock now playing softly in the car, when Agatha’s phone buzzed in her lap. She looked down and saw a name that made her skin go cold.</p><p>
<i>Wanda Maximoff</i>
</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a look.</p><p>“Why is the witch texting me?”</p><p>Rio didn’t react, her eyes steady on the road.</p><p>“She’s the one that’s collecting on your contract. She wants you back at work.”</p><p>Agatha tried to piece together the horrific magnitude of her words. She grit her teeth, eyes locked onto Rio’s face.</p><p>“I will not be working under the purview of Wanda Maximoff. I’d rather chew off my own hands.”</p><p>Rio shrugged.</p><p>“That’d be a pity. She’s the ASAC and is heading this new division. Unless you want to change career paths, you’re not just under her purview, you’re taking her orders.”</p><p>Agatha clicked on the offending text, her eyes darting through it.</p><p>
<i>”We’re looking forward to having you back, Agatha. Vis and I have a guesthouse should you need a place to stay. Billy and Tommy have heard all the stories about Agent Harkness (the appropriate ones) and they’re so excited to meet you.</i>
</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek hard enough to draw blood and squeezed her phone so hard in her hand that it creaked.</p><p>“I will be requesting a transfer.”</p><p>Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Just meet her team first. They’re wonderful and I think you’ll like them.”</p><p>“I’ve never liked anyone. This world is filled with the inept and insidious.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer and Agatha risked a glance after several minutes had passed.</p><p>Rio looked just as beautiful as she always had. Dark features, soft cheeks, her hair hanging in rich, brown waves. But she also looked tired. She was thinner than she had been before Agatha left and her eyes held a little less light.</p><p>Rio had always managed her suffering with a rather macabre ease. She’d lost so much as a child that anything she faced in her adulthood had seemed light in comparison. Until Nicky.</p><p>But instead of falling apart, instead of succumbing to the mind-numbing sadness that had overtaken Agatha, Rio had poured herself into her work. She’d tried to move on and Agatha could never forgive her for that.</p><p>Agatha knew she should look away, should place her eyes somewhere safer, but she wasn’t able to manage it before Rio met her gaze.</p><p>The power of it, even after all this time, hadn’t diminished. There was always something electric in their bond; an easy burn, a heady, all-consuming need that had drawn them together in the first place. Agatha had never been good at ignoring it.</p><p>But Rio’s eyes returned to the road and she pursed her lips.</p><p>“Will you try?”</p><p>Agatha frowned, knowing her meaning but not wanting to answer.</p><p>“Try to what? Go back to a life that burned to the ground? Pretend nothing happened? I’m not you.”</p><p>Rio’s expression froze in place, a mask contrived to keep all things hidden beneath it. But her eyes. . . Agatha could read worlds in them. And now they were all pain.</p><p>Rio did not speak again.</p><p>_________</p><p>Crossing territory lines seemed to bring to the forefront the reality that Agatha was really coming home. The only place that had ever truly been a home. Now it felt like a prison; walls made up of the expectations of others and a truly dire lack of prospects if Agatha didn’t accept her sentence.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t answered Wanda, nor did she plan to. But now she was going to need to make considerations for where exactly she would stay. It took time to find an apartment. There was always an option to take temporary housing in a federal safe house but the risk was having to move out should it be needed.</p><p>They were twenty minutes out, Agatha no closer to thinking of a solution, when Rio offered one.</p><p>“There’s– You could stay in the guest room.”</p><p>Even the thought of it sent a pang of sorrow cutting through Agatha.</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>Agatha reached forward and turned up the volume, the commercial currently playing piercing into her ear drums.</p><p>Rio slapped the power button, drenching the car in silence.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse was rocketing, her heart beating savagely in her chest.</p><p>“Don’t offer me that. Please.”</p><p>They reached a red light and Rio pulled to a stop before turning to look at her.</p><p>“Wanda can pull some strings and get you situated in a safe house until you can find a place.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Agatha would do anything to be out of this car. Out from under the watchful eyes of the ex-love-of-her-life. She wanted a moment to think, to process the drastic change her life had taken in the past day. She needed to decide her next steps and if she was even willing to put a foot back into the world that had destroyed her.</p><p>Rio had pulled over then and left the car to make her call. Agatha was glad for it. She didn’t want to hear it. But she did watch. She saw the easy way Rio pulled her phone free and called without hesitation. The small smile that pulled on her lips at something <i>Wanda</i> was saying. The way Rio’s face fell and her head shook a moment later. It was far too routine-looking for Agatha’s comfort and she tore her eyes away.</p><p>Minutes later they were driving again, toward Alexandria, and Agatha let herself enjoy the beauty of Virginia in the Fall. The city was awash with shades of red, orange, and gold. Asphalt turned into cobblestone as they headed into Old Town toward the Potomac River.</p><p>Rio pulled to a stop in the driveway of a massive end-unit townhome with a brick and stone exterior. It was stunning and well-kept and Agatha raised an impressed brow.</p><p>“Some strings. This has to be a three million dollar home.”</p><p>“Three-point-six.”</p><p>Agatha feigned shock.</p><p>“Oooh, so thoughtful of our lovely ASAC. Did she have champagne dropped at the door?”</p><p>Rio got out of the car and walked to the back to open the trunk.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and followed suit, stepping next to Rio to stare at her meager belongings. A suitcase and three boxes had made the trip.</p><p>There were other boxes in the back seat but Agatha wasn’t going to ask about them.</p><p>Rio moved to pick up a box and Agatha waved her off.</p><p>“I’ll manage.”</p><p>Rio ignored her, easily hefting the box in her arms and moving toward the front of the home. She put in a code and Agatha watched her enter through the rosewood door before tugging her suitcase from the trunk. She dragged it along the bumpy cobblestone and tried not to allow the impending sense of doom overtake her.</p><p>As she stepped through the door she came face to face with an exiting Rio.</p><p>Both paused, eyes caught in a familiar dance. Rio stepped closer without thought and fuck if Agatha didn’t miss the shape of her. She was always so bold, so open to giving Agatha attention and affection. She was beautiful.</p><p>Agatha shoved her suitcase into Rio’s knees and turned on her heel to grab the final two boxes. She stacked them and carried their weight through the doorway, glad to have a barrier between her and whatever ghost might appear in front of her.</p><p>Agatha set the boxes on the closest table and turned, eager for Rio to leave. Instead she found that Rio had brought two more boxes, the ones from her back seat.</p><p>She set them just inside the door and gave Agatha a look.</p><p>“I understand your new aesthetic is lackadaisical lumberjack but I thought you might want some office-appropriate clothing. Up to you, of course.”</p><p>Rio hesitated and looked like she was deciding between moving forward or turning to leave.</p><p>Agatha needed it to be the latter. She nodded her head, hand gripping the wood of the front door as if to close it.</p><p>“Of course. Goodbye, Rio.”</p><p>Rio pressed a hand against the door to keep it from moving and spoke in a tone unheard by either of them in five years. It was a whisper, so filled with hope and this somehow <i>enduring</i> care that Rio had held for so long.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha felt like the wind had been struck from her lungs. She felt tears in her eyes and the anticipation that clawed at her was a death sentence.</p><p>“Goodbye.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s resistance on the door ease off and she started to close it, desperate to put space between them. She looked away from the acquiescence in Rio’s expression and heard the scrape of shoes on stone as Rio turned away, leaving Agatha in another empty, soulless home. At least this one was beautiful.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke to an incessant knocking on her door and she buried her head under the pillow. The light was bright in the room, the curtains succeeding in looking nice and not much else. She held down the pillow over her ears and tried to drift into the blissfully rare dreamless sleep. The knocking remained persistent and echoed throughout the large townhome.</p><p>Agatha snarled as she flung herself from the bed and nearly ran into the wardrobe that sat empty beside it. She caught herself, face inches from a rather violent nose job, and took a deep, irritated breath.</p><p>The knocking came again and Agatha stormed out of her temporary room, down the hallway and stairs, and flung open the front door with a acid in her veins.</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Wanda stood at the door in street clothes, straight jeans and a red zip-up. She had a gentle smile on her face and a briefcase in her hand.</p><p>Agatha almost reared back at the sight of her, eyes taking in the face of her Quantico nemesis turned partner. She straightened and tried not to let her disgust show on her face. She failed, hearing it through her words as well.</p><p>“Maximoff. To what do I owe this absolute pleasure.”</p><p>Wanda seemed to take note of Agatha’s oversized t-shirt and bed head and did not hide her amusement.</p><p>“Hello, Agatha. I’ve brought gifts.”</p><p>Agatha stepped back to make space and felt like she’d just invited a vampire into her home. She walked angrily toward the kitchen and knew Wanda was following even if she couldn’t hear her steps.</p><p>“Is there something I can do for you? I was under the impression I wouldn’t have to take your orders until I set foot in the WFO.”</p><p>Agatha started opening the cabinets in search of a mug. Four doors in she grew agitated and she clattered through the kitchen feeling eyes on her back.</p><p>Wanda cleared her throat.</p><p>Agatha turned to find Wanda with two ceramic, white coffee mugs in hand pulled from a lower cabinet. Who the fuck puts mugs there?</p><p>Wanda set them down on the counter and tilted her head curiously.</p><p>“So you’ve decided to come back?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed as she manhandled the strange pod-machine into opening, the whir of it high-pitched and slow. She shoved in the first pod she grabbed and clicked at the buttons until it stopped flashing.</p><p>“Right. I definitely had a choice and you didn’t strongarm me by sending the beast of hell to my doorstep.”</p><p>Wanda frowned, forehead creasing in that way it did when she was about to lecture Agatha on propriety and doing what was right.</p><p>“Don’t call her that.”</p><p>Agatha ignored the pang of guilt and shoved her coffee mug under the spout.</p><p>“Sorry, Director. I’ll curb my worst qualities in your presence.”</p><p>Wanda sighed and leaned back against the counter, her eyes soft and understanding. It made Agatha sick.</p><p>“I can put you on another team if my position makes you uncomfortable.” She paused, then, “It would have been yours, you know? If you’d stayed.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the sputtering coffee as it filled her mug, feeling baited even though she knew Wanda was almost never intentionally cruel or cold-hearted.</p><p>“I’m sure. The Bureau loves hysterics in their women.”</p><p>The machine beeped  and she picked up the burning mug in her hands, letting the heat of it ground her. She pointedly did not move to make Wanda a cup.</p><p>Wanda, true to herself, did not seem bothered. She started the process of making her own coffee.</p><p>“Don’t downplay your loss.”</p><p>Agatha, true to herself, wanted to strangle Wanda. Instead, she took a scalding drink and focused on the pain in her throat as it burned down past her lungs and into her belly. Her tone was sharp as she responded.</p><p>“I know what I lost, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda started the machine and looked at it for a little too long like she wasn’t sure what to say. Eventually, she reached for the briefcase she’d set on the counter. She popped the tabs and opened it to reveal a stack of folders and a sleek, new laptop.</p><p>“I know you haven’t made up your mind, but I brought you the team dossiers so you know what you’re walking into should you choose to return. I included the files on the case that came through today. Foreign Lobbying scandal. Shouldn’t be too challenging. There’s an issued laptop as well, but that you’ll need to give back if you decide to withdraw.”</p><p>“Just like that? No psychiatrist visit to ensure that I’m well enough to function on a federal level?”</p><p>Wanda smiled.</p><p>“I have some sway with the SAC. But there are fail safes in place should they be needed.”</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“I’m sure.” She shook her head and set her coffee on the kitchen table. “Why even risk this, Wanda? Why not just void the contract and wash your hands of this? I’m not the agent I was five years ago.”</p><p>It felt like dirt on her tongue; an admission of weakness. But none of this made sense. She’d been able to extend the recall contract from three years to six with a single phone call. Chief Jones hadn’t had any issues deflecting the requests that had started to come through around the fourth year. Then suddenly it was over and Rio of all people had shown up to cart her back?</p><p>Wanda removed the documents and tech and set them on the kitchen table. She retrieved her coffee but didn’t drink, her eyes studying Agatha.</p><p>“In the past three years that you’ve been working as a Detective, you never once faltered or had a disciplinary action on your case.” Wanda amended herself with a hum. “At least not one that is related to your ability to do your job. Just your addition to their department led to precinct-wide increases on the NYPD’s tracked measurables. Why wouldn’t I want you back on my team?”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the stack of documents, pushing them to read the names on the outside. She wasn’t sure what to say to Wanda’s emphatic praise and so she said nothing.</p><p>Wanda seemed to take that as her cue to be an idiot.</p><p>“I missed you, you know?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up, twisting the mug in her hands.</p><p>“Thanks for stopping by, Wanda. I’ll keep you posted on whether I decide to come in on Monday.”</p><p>Wanda seemed to consider whether to push but it was a forgone conclusion. She always did.</p><p>“You can pretend we never got over our Quantico rivalry if it makes you feel better, Agatha, but you were my partner for three years. You were my friend. And I’m still here when you decide you’re tired of being alone” Wanda’s eyes burned into her. “I’m not the only one.”</p><p>Agatha chewed on the inside of her cheek. It was exhausting keeping up these walls that she’d had to rebuild after she left; walls that several people had had hands in tearing down in the first place. Now, despite her efforts, they felt fragile, like shoddy craftsmanship and a hurricane headed their direction.</p><p>Wanda and Rio were practiced in the art of it. Where Rio was bold, prodding, and patient, Wanda had always been honest and kind. It had disgusted Agatha to no end until that honesty and kindness had become a safe harbor.</p><p>Agatha as she was now could not fathom entertaining such kindness. But she gave a small allowance.</p><p>“I’ll look over everything. Thank you. For bringing them over. And finding me a place to stay. It’s only sort of a dump.”</p><p>Wanda smiled and let Agatha dismiss the many pointed comments from before.</p><p>“Good.” Wanda took a sip of her coffee and grimaced before offering an apologetic smile. She set it on the counter to go cold. “The offer still stands, you know? I’d love to have you if you need a place to stay. The guest house is entirely separate from the main house. You wouldn’t even have to see us if you didn’t want to.” Wanda tilted her head and offered an amendment. “I can’t promise the boys wouldn’t come looking, but they’re harmless.”</p><p>Agatha felt a violent stab in her heart at the adoring look in Wanda’s eyes as she spoke of her family. She couldn’t stop herself from digging the knife deeper.</p><p>“How old are they? Your boys?”</p><p>Wanda hesitated, then gave Agatha a sad smile.</p><p>“They turned four last week.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes filled with unshed tears and she looked down to collect herself. Nicholas had died just days before his fourth birthday. She remembered the curious little frown that would take over his face as he tried to understand concepts beyond his little mind. He’d begun an incessant use of the word “why” and it had become a game for her and Rio to pass off the questions onto one another.</p><p>Agatha tried to push away the bittersweet, agonizing memories and failed. She just wanted to be alone.</p><p>Wanda seemed to understand and she walked forward, offering a light tough to Agatha’s shoulder. She squeezed once and let go.</p><p>“Let me know if you need anything, Agatha.”</p><p>She left Agatha to her grief.</p><p>__________</p><p>Agatha spread the files of four Agents on the table in front of her. She recognized their names from Field Offices across the US and was begrudgingly impressed that Wanda had managed to pull them all here.</p><p>
<b>Name: Lilia Calderu<br/>
Position: Special Agent, FBI<br/>
Years of Service: 22 years<br/>
Field of Expertise: Counterterrorism</b>
</p><p>
<b>Lilia joined the FBI in 2004, beginning her career as a special agent in a Violent Crimes Task Force. Her excellent analytical skills quickly propelled her into the Counterterrorism Division where she became a key player in several high-stakes operations.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Calderu played a pivotal role in thwarting a series of planned terrorist attacks by the Salem Seven in 2015. Her efforts not only led to the arrests of several individuals but also strengthened the FBI's proactive measures against domestic threats.</b>
</p><p>Agatha had just started her training in Quantico when the news of the Salem Seven’s capture broke. She’d studied the documents that weren’t redacted during her testing, eventually gaining access to further classified information once she was on her own journey to making a name for herself. Lilia had been the one to discover two key names that led to their leader's arrest.</p><p>Agatha looked through Lilia’s other accolades and found the information rather useless. Data was fine, needed sometimes, but personality made or destroyed a team and the file didn’t mention anything relating to Lilia’s difficulty in sticking with one specialized team.</p><p>Agatha looked at the next file.</p><p>
<b>Name: Jennifer Kale<br/>
Position: Forensics Analyst, FBI<br/>
Years of Service: 9 years<br/>
Field of Expertise: Crime Scene Investigation and Forensic Analysis</b>
</p><p>
<b>Jennifer joined the FBI in 2015 as a forensics analyst, quickly establishing herself as a valuable asset to the agency. Her analytical skills and meticulous attention to detail have contributed to the resolution of numerous complex cases. She specializes in analysis of physical evidence and her work improved the evidence processing and analysis efficiency across Field Offices.</b>
</p><p>Agatha had met Jennifer three years into the woman’s career and while she wouldn’t argue against the improvements the woman had made, she could state with certainty that Kale’s ego far outweighed her usefulness.</p><p>The next file drew Agatha to a pause, her brows lifting.</p><p>
<b>Name: Alice Wu-Gulliver<br/>
Position: Special Agent, FBI<br/>
Years of Service: 6 years (including previous service with U.S. Marshals)<br/>
Field of Expertise: Violent Crimes and Counterterrorism</b>
</p><p>Lorna Wu’s prodigal daughter had finally found her way to the FBI. Agatha chuckled, wishing Wanda had included Lorna’s file as well. She had been a legend in her service and had a prolific career in uprooting corruption in multiple police precincts across the US. It had also been what got her killed.</p><p>
<b>Alice began her career with the U.S. Marshals Service and she served for several years. She gained invaluable experience in fugitive recovery, surveillance, and high-risk arrests that benefited her transition to the FBI in 2019. Alice has expertise in crisis negotiation and worked as a liaison to aid nearby local law enforcement.</b>
</p><p>
<b>As a special agent, Alice became a member of a Violent Crimes Task Force, focusing on gang-related violence and organized crime.</b>
</p><p>Nothing alarming there. But again, living in the shadow of your dead mother must have been difficult. It’s probably why she’d joined Violent Crimes instead of Civil Rights Violations.</p><p>Agatha flipped to the last file.</p><p>
<b>Name: Sharon Davis<br/>
Position: Legal Advisor, FBI<br/>
Years of Service: 1 year<br/>
Field of Expertise: Criminal Law and Federal Regulations</b>
</p><p>
<b>After law school, Sharon began her career as a public defender, where she gained invaluable experience in trial advocacy and legal strategy. In 2011, she transitioned to a position as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, where she prosecuted federal cases, including organized crime and white-collar offenses.</b>
</p><p>
<b>In 2023, Sharon joined the FBI as a Legal Advisor, leveraging her extensive legal background to support the agency's operations. She has contributed to the development of internal policies regarding the handling of sensitive information and legal protocols.</b>
</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“What a wet blanket.”</p><p>She tossed the personnel files to the side and picked up the thick case file. She parsed through the first alerts regarding suspicious activity. Odd campaign donations, a strange change in Senator Treseder’s supported legislation. There was an anonymous whistleblower on the Senator’s team that had sent a series of pictures and videos of some interesting meetings.</p><p>Bank records didn’t show any increase in personal wealth, but the Senator had been living like he came into a significant amount of money.</p><p>It was textbook political bribery and Agatha was certain it wouldn’t take long to gather the evidence they needed to convict. She took out the laptop Wanda had left behind and fired it up. There was a sticky note with a username and password stuck to the screen and Agatha wasted no time in logging in.</p><p>She spent the next several hours sifting through the Senator’s recent travel logs, compiling a list of destinations, and cross referencing them against the policies that the Senator had supported in the past year.</p><p>By the time she was satisfied with her progress it was past lunch and creeping into the afternoon. She slowly closed her laptop and pressed her fingers into her eyes to relieve the burning from staring at her screen for so long. She felt… good. In truth, Agatha’s threat to quit the Bureau was an empty one. She’d always known in the deepest recesses of her mind that she would retire or die doing this job.</p><p>But she hadn’t necessarily planned on coming back to DC. Up until this moment, she’d planned on getting her things in order and requesting a transfer. Yet now that she was here, she felt lighter than she had in years. She refused to attest it to anything but the Fall weather and the fact that this had been her only true home before Nicholas had passed. The people had nothing to do with it.</p><p>__________</p><p>Monday came around at a snails’ pace. It felt like the next four days were a trial in patience; one of the many virtues she refused to have.</p><p>She ended up walking the town, visiting the Farmer’s Market, and exploring pubs and bars that surrounded her temporary home. It was beautiful here, and best yet, it was dissimilar enough to  Potomac that she wasn’t feeling the ghost of her life there at every turn.</p><p>Sometimes, at her least prepared, she’d hear or see something that would stop her in her tracks. The squealing laughter of kids at the park or the small pet store she’d passed by with a rabbit so similar to Nicky’s stuffed one that she’d actually debated adopting it. Today, it was the sight of a small liquor store that looked exactly like the one she and Rio had drunkenly stumbled into early in their relationship. Rio had kissed her, had pushed her back until they were collapsing through a display of imported Vodka. It had cost them both half of their paychecks to pay for the damages and she and Rio had subsisted off of shitty pizza and Natty Boh for two weeks. They’d been six months out of Quantico and Agatha had never felt so unfettered or hopeful.</p><p>Now, as Agatha breathed in the smell of warm cider from a food stand outside of the store, she tried not to let her thoughts travel beyond the memory. Agatha turned away, breathing deeply, and bought herself a cider donut to stuff into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha waited until Sunday night to open the boxes Rio had brought for her. Despite her new wardrobe that consisted of jeans and multi-colored flannel, the sight of her old clothing brought her an unexpected comfort. She ran her palm over the sleek long-coat that had been a personal favorite. Underneath was her tan blazer and multiple shirts, blouses, and a white turtleneck that had become a staple in her past wardrobe. The next box held several of her best slacks, her Oxfords, and her favorite leather boots.</p><p>Something seemed to unravel for her then and Agatha looked down at her plain white t-shirt and open, sage cord shirt she’d thrown on with a grimace. Maybe some things in her past were worth going back to.</p><p>_________</p><p>Agatha woke Monday morning to a text from Wanda with instructions on how to re-acquire her ID badge and where she’d be meeting the team. It felt presumptuous to Agatha even if Wanda was correct about her return and she made a note to arrive several minutes late.</p><p>She donned her royal purple slacks, the double-collared blouse, and slid her traveling coat over her arms, reveling in the silky fabric that covered the inside. She stood in front of the floor-length mirror of her room and let out a surprised breath at the imposing figure she presented.</p><p>Agatha pulled her piles of locks into an Edwardian updo and smiled at herself, her hands touching reverently at the lapels of the coat and the pockets of her pants. She was as ready as she could be.</p><p>_________</p><p>Agatha followed the security team to retrieve her new badge and stood for an updated photo to be put on file. She ignored the buzz of her nerves in her body, crushing them down as the elevator carried her to the top floor.</p><p>There was a young kid with too much eyeliner in the elevator, with a badge that designated him as an intern. He seemed to have no problem staring right at her and she sneered.</p><p>“You look like you were born six hours ago.”</p><p>The intern grinned and didn’t seem nearly as put-off as she’d expected. Maybe she was a little rusty.</p><p>“People say I have a young face.” He stuck his hand out eagerly and she took a step back, looking at it warily. “I love your fit. I’m–”</p><p>Agatha waved him away.</p><p>“I don’t care.”</p><p>The doors dinged and Agatha stepped off mouthing ‘my fit’ like she was trying to solve an elaborate puzzle.</p><p>She moved through the space like she’d been coming here every day for the past ten years; like there wasn’t a massive gap in her resume that could only be explained through tragedy.</p><p>She walked toward the designated conference room and heard the irritating patter of feet behind her. With a quick glance she saw the intern following behind her excitedly.</p><p>“I don’t have a bone, Fido. Beat it.”</p><p>The intern laughed. Little freak.</p><p>He caught up to her and she noticed a notebook in his hands that looked nearly fresh from the plastic.</p><p>“We’re going to the same place. I think. You’re Agent Harkness, right?”</p><p>Agatha sped up her pace for the amusement of watching him keep up.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>The intern nodded.</p><p>“I know. I don’t know why I asked. You’re kind of a legend in this office.”</p><p>Well that was an ego-feeder at least. Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Glad my reputation precedes me to the ears of wide-eyed teens.”</p><p> </p><p>They reached the conference room and Agatha didn’t knock before flinging open the door. She heard the intern mumble “I’m twenty” as the room revealed itself, the eyes of everyone inside landing on her. Agatha rolled her neck slightly, feeding off the attention, letting it bolster her.</p><p>She stepped into the room and threw a thumb back toward the intern.</p><p>“He’s late.”</p><p>The boy scrambled in behind her and spouted off apologies as he took the closest empty seat.</p><p>Wanda was sitting across from her, mild exasperation on her face as Agatha took the last open seat.</p><p>“Agatha, thank you for joining us.”</p><p>Agatha let her eyes wander to the Agent beside her and found Jennifer Kale regarding her with the same level of judgment she’d had when they’d met the first time.</p><p>Jennifer offered a less-than-sincere smile.</p><p>“Welcome back, Harkness. The Bureau has missed your compunction.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brow, settling into an old skin as she leaned back in her chair.</p><p>“Wow, coming from the shit-sampler.”</p><p>There was a startled snort from the woman beside Wanda and Agatha turned her attention over. Lilia. She was older than Agatha expected; she was dressed like a business casual fortune teller with a silky, floral blouse under her blazer and gaudy jewelry around her neck and wrists.</p><p>Wanda caught her eyes and gave her a warning look.</p><p>“Let’s try that again. Agatha, meet Agents Calderu, Gulliver and Kale. This is our Legal Advisor, Sharon Davis. Everyone, Agent Harkness.”</p><p>Sharon looked like a mom-grandma. Agatha didn’t know how else to describe her. She looked like she ran an HOA and charged families a $500 fine if their flowers were the color of sapphire instead of cobalt. She smiled at Agatha like she was happy to meet her which was also somewhat alarming.</p><p>“Welcome, Agent Harkness!” She wagged a finger, her voice somehow nasal and shrill. “I was told to keep my eye on you.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Wanda imploringly. How was she meant to behave in a room with a teenage boy, a lab rat, Zoltar, a Stepford widow, and– Agatha took in the last woman and let out a puff of a laugh– a Hot Topic employee. This was unbelievable.</p><p>Alice had her arms crossed, her face less than impressed.</p><p>“Hey, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha nodded back, expression shifting between amused and falsely severe.</p><p>Jennifer held a hand out toward Agatha but spoke directly to Wanda.</p><p>“I told you this was a bad idea.”</p><p>Agatha leaned over, whispering loudly.</p><p>“Should have had that thought about that dress but you can’t win all the time.”</p><p>Wanda set her hands on the table in front of her, eyes hard.</p><p>“Enough. You’re both adults and acting like it should not be a chore.”</p><p>Agatha had to hand it to her. The wide-eyed Wanda from Quantico had been utterly snuffed out. In her place was a woman with the confidence and power to say what she wanted and the tenacity to make it happen.</p><p>Agatha held out her hands in surrender.</p><p>“My apologies, It must have been something I ate.” Agatha looked to the screen at the end of the room. “Want to catch me up on your progress?”</p><p>Wanda watched her for several moments longer and Agatha felt a creeping discomfort on her skin. She wouldn’t admit she found the stare unnerving or impressive. At least not to Wanda’s face.</p><p>Wanda finally turned away.</p><p>“In brief, we’re looking into the possible corruption of Senator Treseder.”</p><p>Wanda began to move through the evidence Agatha was already privy to with added details; the identities of the people Treseder met with and their associated organizations and origins and the identified time frames the videos were taken within.</p><p>Agatha listened to the input from Lilia on the Senator’s facial and physical cues, then grew bored as she narrowed in on the fact that he seemed to have rearranged his office from one video to the next. She’d just reiterated that his behavior was creating security when Agatha interrupted.</p><p>“So he moved his desk between himself and the door. He’s scared. Doesn’t mean he’s under duress.”</p><p>Alice chimed in.</p><p>“I agree. He could just be crafting a false sense of power to establish some control.”</p><p>Lilia opened her mouth to retort but Wanda intervened.</p><p>“It’s something to keep in mind as we pursue this case. Now,” Wanda flicked to the next screen. “His travel itinerary. Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha perked up. Either Wanda was patronizing her or she’d give Agatha the particular evidence she had knowing that she’d come in to present it. Bitch.</p><p>Agatha didn’t pull up her notes but she recited the information she’d put together by memory.</p><p>“The way I see it, there’s two organizations of note. PuriTech;  South African water sustainability organization with feelers out for US investors. The other is BioVantage Alliance: a German biotech company that is working to create therapies and devices that will help manage chronic illnesses.”</p><p>Jennifer looked through the files in front of her.</p><p>“What about Bright Cell in India? Treseder was there six months ago. He’s never been to Germany nor South Africa.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“It’s a red herring. Look at his travel list. France, The Netherlands, Switzerland, China, Brazil, India. These countries have close economic ties with Germany, South Africa, or both. We just have to figure out where the pieces fit. My money is on BioVantage.”</p><p>Agatha finished and sat back, watching as the rest of the room sorted through their notes to put her pieces together themselves. It felt good. No, it felt fantastic. She held back a smug grin just in time to turn and find Wanda watching her with a look in her eye that Agatha was not a fan of. It looked proud or affirmed and Agatha responded to it with a mocking grimace.</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes and stood.</p><p>“Great. It looks like you have this under control. Keep me in the loop.” She placed a hand on the intern’s shoulder. “Make sure you’re setting a good example—“</p><p>Wanda’s voice faded out as Agatha refocused on the evidence.</p><p>For the first time in five years, Agatha felt excitement. Warm adrenaline flared through as she dove into the Senator’s printed speeches.</p><p>——————</p><p>Two hours later, Alice called everyone’s attention.</p><p>“Agatha’s theory checks out. BioVantage has shareholders in four out of six of the countries Treseder visited in the past five years. Flight logs show that these key shareholders were present in the countries when Treseder arrived. I was only able to find footage from the most recent; a restaurant in Rouen, France.” She threw up an image on the board. “That’s Senator Treseder.” She zoomed in. “And that is private shareholder, Juliette Lefebvre.”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t felt pride in her work in a long time. She failed to make any kind of ego-stroking comment until it was too late and settled for a nod.</p><p>“I also went through the Senator’s transcripts. He had no commentary for medical innovation up until four years ago when it became a focus of his platform.”</p><p>The intern in the corner spoke up excitedly.</p><p>“He pushed for additional funding of the Transatlantic Medical Innovation Fund last year and his branding adjusted to champion him as an advocate for public health.”</p><p>Agatha startled, hand pressing to her chest.</p><p>“I forgot you were here.” She looked over at his stack of documents and the filled pages of his notebook. “Why do you have clearance to be here?”</p><p>The intern looked pleased that she’d asked and Agatha already regretted it.</p><p>“I’m the Case Analysis Intern. I am a graduate student in forensic psych and—“</p><p>Agatha stopped listening as the intern continued to droll on and on. Then she frowned.</p><p>“You’re a graduate student at 20?”</p><p>She’d clearly interrupted him but he didn’t seem to care as he quickly changed directions with a smile.</p><p>“I’m accelerated.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, nodding, and went back to work.</p><p>——————</p><p>By four Agatha felt like they’d done everything they could with the paper in their hands.</p><p>“I think we set a team on the Senator to track his movements.”</p><p>Sharon let out a weird squawk and shook her head like Agatha was a toddler about to touch a hot stove.</p><p>“We have to submit for warrants.”</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“Is this your job? Play buzzkill for a team of highly decorated special agents?”</p><p>Sharon pressed her hands flat on the table.</p><p>“Due diligence is important to ensure all evidence is admissible in court.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Great. Well our personified constitution here can pull her warrants and I’ll see you all tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha saw the movements of the rest of the team as they started to gather their things before she strode down the hallway.</p><p>Agatha was vibrating with energy that she wasn’t sure how to spend. Her steps felt lighter, her mind- absently wrestling with the complexities of the case- couldn’t spin out and replay her deepest agonies. She’d needed this and she would never admit it to a single soul.</p><p>Agatha stepped outside the Field Office, the crisp air welcome in her lungs, and slowed to a stop just moments later. The peace that had threatened to settle with her slipped away.</p><p>Rio was standing outside the doors in a deep crimson turtleneck with a blazer sitting snugly overtop. She looked— Agatha blinked away the following thoughts and slowly approached.</p><p>“Stalking on FBI grounds might be a stupid way to go.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, eyes searching.</p><p>“I wanted to see how your first day went.”</p><p>Agatha’s body felt overly warm for the chill weather and she was torn between sprinting away from this threat to her calm and letting herself get lost in the convoluted tangle of emotions that always arose at thoughts or conversations with Rio.</p><p>“It was bearable.”</p><p>Rio smirked, shaking her head, and Agatha noticed that she looked exhausted.</p><p>“That’s all one can ask of their job.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what to say. The words that wanted to escape were a jumble of rage and need and frustration and Agatha was sure that they would come out in a sob or a plea. Rio had the right to neither.</p><p>Rio tilted her head toward the road.</p><p>“Walk and talk?”</p><p>Agatha recoiled, a cruel laugh leaving her throat.</p><p>“I’m not interested.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what it was that turned her naturally dismissive nature into a seething, heartless fiend every time she saw Rio’s face or stood in her presence. She’d never even considered trying to stop it because it stomped out her grief for small moments.</p><p>But now, unlike the easy, unbothered reception she usually received for her bitchiness, Rio seemed to withdraw. Her shoulders dropped so slightly that nobody else would have noticed and it took longer than it should for Rio’s slate-blank mask to settle in place. Rio offered a tired smile that didn’t reach her eyes.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha.”</p><p>She turned away and Agatha felt a bolt of panic crawl up her spine as the thought that Rio would give up on her. It was selfish and terrifying and she tried to swallow down the fear as she stared after her.</p><p>A mix of turmoil and longing were fighting for priority and the words were out of her mouth before she had realized that longing had won the battle.</p><p>“Do you want to get a drink?”</p><p>Rio slowed. She took a moment to turn around and the careful hope in her expression made Agatha wish she could stuff the question back in her mouth and choke on it. She couldn’t do this again. She couldn’t find herself caught up in the mess they’d created of their marriage and the violence of their shared grief.</p><p>Rio seemed to grasp the truth from Agatha’s startled expression and a real smile, still small, curved her mouth.</p><p>“Ask me again when you mean it.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to say she did and she wanted to say she never would but instead she watched Rio walk away with her heart and any happiness she’d mustered up throughout her first day back.</p><p>She started her trek home with her mind lost in too many memories, the most pressing dragging her into a very sleepless night.</p><p>Nicholas had lost his stuffed bunny. Their house wasn’t that large and they kept things tidy, yet Agatha and Rio had spent forty minutes straight doggedly searching it for Señor Scratchy. Nicky’s wails had become background noise and yet they still pierced like knives into their eardrums. Agatha had already been running on four hours of sleep and Rio hadn’t been home the night prior due to a case that had taken her out of town. It was truly the worst case scenario and their frayed nerves and exhaustion levels had them sniping at one another as they passed through room after room.</p><p>Rio had looked almost manic, her eyeliner smudged slightly and her suit entirely wrinkled after spending an ungodly amount of time on her knees looking under furniture.</p><p>“Are you sure he didn’t lose it before you picked him up from daycare?”</p><p>Agatha was in her silk robe but it had done nothing to ease the tension building in her shoulders. She pressed her fingers into her temples and snarked back.</p><p>“Yes, Rio. He had it before dinner. I had to trick it away from him while also spooning mush into his mouth because you were home three hours after you said you’d be.”</p><p>Rio had just stepped into the bathroom when she fell back, her attention now full on Agatha. It was something Agatha had always adored; the single-minded focus of her wife whenever she put her mind to a task.</p><p>Rio had moved toward her with intent and laced their fingers together, her free hand brushing Agatha’s hair from her eyes.</p><p>“I’m sorry, sweetheart. I didn’t mean to blame you.”</p><p>Agatha had leaned into her touch, had wrapped her arms around Rio and all but collapsed in her arms.</p><p>“You don’t need to apologize. We’re both just on edge and tired and,” Agatha had waved her hand around in frustration, “this house is not big enough for us to have lost his goddamn rabbit!”</p><p>Rio had laughed then, her tired eyes lighting up.</p><p>“Should we just get him a real one? They’re probably harder to lose.”</p><p>Agatha had dropped her head on Rio’s shoulder, turning her nose into Rio’s neck and pressing a kiss there.</p><p>“Don’t let him hear that unless you mean it.”</p><p>About that time the cries had turned to sniffles, then silence followed. Rio and Agatha had chuckled softly and collapsed onto the couch, both falling asleep in positions that would destroy their bodies the next day.</p><p>The rabbit had been found the next day in Nicky’s high chair, covered in the star puffs he loved to suck on and spit out all over the house.</p><p>Agatha blinked, chest sore and gnawing, and looked where her feet had taken her. She was right beside the pet store, the same rabbit from the week before curled up in the window. He looked so soft and so much like Se​​ñor Scratchy that she slowed to a stop.</p><p>Twenty minutes later Agatha found herself walking out of the shop with a new companion.</p>

<p>Agatha had Se​​ñor Scratchy for a total of two hours before the decision caught up to her. She set his crate on the table to unpack the playpen and built it on the living room floor. She put down a pad for traction- something she’d purchased at the suggestion of the worker- and then haphazardly dumped in paper-based bedding. She placed a water and a pellet bowl, a litter box, and a few cardboard boxes they’d given her for free. She had gotten a cedar stick and small blocks of hay and she laid them out with a furrowed brow.</p><p>After arranging it with a fair amount of uncertainty, Agatha stared at the crate and the deceptively large creature inside. The shop had said that he was six years old, already able to use the box, and that the owner that had adopted him prior had returned him due to the rabbit being ‘untrainable.’ Now, as Agatha stared at his little face peeking out from the gate she wasn’t positive this was the best option for her first pet.</p><p>She carefully set the crate in the enclosure and opened the gate before sitting down and watching from the couch with a faint trace of trepidation. She watched his little nose peek out, then his two front feet, and then he stopped and laid down.</p><p>Agatha waited, her concern growing as she watched. Had she somehow already failed? Did she need a different bedding? She knew it was a bit sparsely decorated but the other tubes and tunnels and toys were things she had to have delivered.</p><p>Agatha’s heart leapt into her throat, startled, as Se​​ñor Scratch suddenly flung himself forward, zooming around the cage at such a speed that she was worried he’d crash into the side. The bedding puffed and flew about like confetti, spraying outside of the cage and coating the hardwood floors.</p><p>A rather explosive spray had Se​​ñor Scratchy launching over the playpen wall and disappearing in a span of seconds.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha stood and followed the paper trail toward her kitchen. “Scratchy?” Her voice was sing-song and filled with mild panic. “Come here, little shit.”</p><p>For the next twenty minutes Agatha searched, her anxiety increasing. She caught sight of him once as he zoomed from the office and down the hall, leaving behind a slightly nibbled-on office chair that probably cost more than Agatha's previous monthly rent.</p><p>She felt like an idiot; chasing any animal was embarrassing, but being outclassed by a bunny for the second time in her life felt like a serious blow to her ego. At least this one had a brain.</p><p>Ten minutes more and Agatha was leaning toward panic. She was just one person in a massive space with four bedrooms and an unfathomable five bathrooms. Not to mention the sitting nooks and separate living rooms and the offices all filled with expensive furniture and lamp cords.</p><p>Agatha pressed her hand to her forehead and tried to decide if asking for help would kill her. The answer was a definitive and emphatic ‘yes’ and the search continued. She unplugged all lamps and electronics in case wires were chewed through and cleared the house like she was looking for a suspect, closing doors behind her.</p><p>Eventually she cornered the bunny in the second bedroom of the first floor and closed them in together. Agatha took a step toward him and the bunny bolted under the bed. She groaned and gave up, slowly lowering herself to the floor.</p><p>The day was catching up to her. Returning to the Bureau, disappointing Rio <i>again</i>, adopting a bunny… Agatha shook her head. She’d been convinced that this was the right move but maybe she was just simply going insane. She closed her eyes and slumped further into the wall.</p><p>Her mind raced, eyes staring at the ceiling before they started to drift shut. Sometime later, Agatha felt the softest fur and a gentle nudge against her fingers. She blinked awake, the room darker than before, and saw that Se​​ñor Scratchy was sitting idly by her hand. She held her breath as she lifted a pinky and brushed it down his fur. He didn’t bolt. But he did start chewing the carpet.</p><p>Agatha, as careful as she could be, scooped him with both hands and managed to open the bedroom door. He squirmed slightly but didn’t fling himself out of her arms and she carried him back to the playpen.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what to do. It didn’t seem right to lock him in his cage for the night but if she left him out he could just jump over the playpen wall.</p><p>Agatha gently set him down in the mess of bedding and prepared herself to see another round of zoomies. Instead, she watched as he burrowed down, wiggling his body until it was halfway submerged in paper shavings.</p><p>Agatha sat down next to the pen and watched the rise and fall of his fluffy body and the twitch of his nose from where it poked out. She couldn’t take her eyes from him and her mind carried her to a place she didn’t want to go.</p><p>She saw herself with Nicholas, his hand squeezed so tightly around two of her fingers that she had tried many times to loosen his grip. He was enamored, his pretty, blue eyes sparkling with joy as he watched the bunnies at the petting zoo spring around one another. There were dozens of them of varying color and size and Nicholas had been asking to visit them for months.</p><p>Their turn came up and Nicky suddenly seemed nervous. He’d looked up at Agatha with so much young worry.</p><p>“Mama, what if they’re scared of me?”</p><p>Agatha knelt down, running her free hand through Nicky’s hair.</p><p>“How could anyone ever be scared of you, sweet boy? Just be gentle.”</p><p>Nicholas’ face had turned from concern to determination, his little head nodding.</p><p>“Gentle like with Mr. Molly’s cat?”</p><p>Agatha bit back a grin. Mr. O’Malley, their old, grumpy, next door neighbor, had repeatedly tried to correct Nicholas’ pronunciation of his name to no avail.</p><p>It didn’t stop the man from sitting outside every Sunday in hopes that Nicky would come visit with one or both of his moms. He’d have little snacks, tea, coloring books, and the prettiest orange tabby named Boggle waiting just in case.</p><p>The few times they’d missed it, Agatha and Rio had felt so badly they’d brought Nicky the next day with cookies or brownies. It became such a common practice that Sundays felt strange without their visits.</p><p>Nicholas squared his shoulders and pushed open the gate.</p><p>Agatha followed him in as her eyes lifted to the surrounding crowd and found her wife. Rio was watching with such adoration, her eyes following the movements of their son.</p><p>It had been a perfect day. Nicky had sat down and promptly been swarmed by bunnies hopping and stepping across his legs and nudging his hands. They nibbled at his clothes and he giggled with so much joy that Agatha had wanted to cry. The pictures from that trip were printed and hung up in their home for the short year that remained of Nicholas’ life.</p><p>Agatha laid back on the hardwood floors, her eyes tracking the subtle movements of the creature she’d quite thoughtlessly brought into her home until she fell asleep.</p><p>__________</p><p>The next morning was one from hell. She woke up with terrible stitches in her neck and back and Se​​ñor Scratchy chewing on the ends of her hair. She groaned loudly, pulling her now wet hair free and painstakingly moving to stand. She stared down at the playpen with a bemused frown.</p><p>“If I leave you in this, are you going to destroy the house?” Se​​ñor Scratchy blinked, a too-large bunch of hay hanging out of his mouth. She grimaced and nodded. “Right. Of course you are.”</p><p>That was how Agatha found herself late for the second day in a row. She ran to the store to buy chicken wire and covered the top of the pen with it. It was arduous for a temporary fix but she didn’t have any other options. A rabbit enclosure would take at least two days to arrive and apparently she’d adopted the most athletic creature on the planet.</p><p>__________</p><p>Agatha stepped into the elevator, this time headed for her supposed office. The team had been given a classified operations area where they’d be able to work and meet without interference or distraction.</p><p>By the time Agatha arrived, everyone was already situated in shared offices.</p><p>She had to admit that it wasn’t a bad spot. It was mostly wood with a command center as the common space; there was a large tech table and several scattered screens that looked like they had been dropped off but unassembled. There was a small kitchen off to the side of the common space and then three large offices. They each had a single, wooden door with a glass pane and the rest of the walls were made of wood until they became windows halfway up. No blinds in sight.</p><p>She could see Alice and Lilia had paired off, both hard at work decorating their chosen sides. She grimaced and looked at Sharon and Jennifer; odd pair, but actually. . . Agatha tilted her head, weighing the strangeness of it. She shrugged. It kind of made sense. There was a strong scent of lavender and vanilla pouring from their room and Agatha gagged slightly as she made her way to the last office.</p><p>Solitude. She chuckled as she pressed her hand against the door. Whether it was incidental or intentional, Agatha always preferred to be alone. Having an office to herself was ideal for her continued time here and for her very immediate future where she would bury her face in her arms and rethink her life choices.</p><p>She stepped into her office and a wave of rhythm and synthetic cymbals hit her ears. She reared back as the intern stood from where he’d been dwarfed behind the double-screens on his desk. He looked pleased, his hand raised in excitement, and Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No. What? Who are you?!” He opened his mouth but she kept speaking. “Interns are at the common table.” She waved him toward the door. “Now shoo.”</p><p>The intern looked confused, his stupidly young face pinching as he stumbled over his words.</p><p>“I– Wanda said–” He stood, half grabbing his things. “I thought I was supposed to be here but I definitely could have misunderstood.”</p><p>“You didn’t.”</p><p>Wanda appeared at Agatha’s back and offered her a saccharine smile.</p><p>“Thank you for showing up again, Agatha. You’ll be sharing this office with William.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Wanda ignored her, giving the intern a real smile.</p><p>“Let me know if she gives you any trouble. You are a part of this team until the end of your Internship.”</p><p>Agatha tossed her keys on the table.</p><p>“When is that, again?”</p><p>The intern set his things back down.</p><p>“Twelve months! Well, Eleven and twenty-nine days now.”</p><p>Agatha dropped into her chair and groaned loudly, her head falling back.</p><p>Wanda tapped her knuckles on the door frame.</p><p>“Play nice. I have a SAC Conference for most of the day but Sharon was able to procure your warrants.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her desk for several minutes in an attempt to blink herself back into a reality where she wasn’t sharing an office with a literal child. She heard a crinkle of paper and looked up to find the intern pressing a poster of the Wizard of Oz up on the wall. He turned and grinned.</p><p>“What do you think? I figured we should probably make the space cozy since we’ll spend all our time here.”</p><p>Agatha stared at him blankly.</p><p>“Are you the coffee type of intern?”</p><p>The boy shrugged.</p><p>“I can be. How do you like yours?”</p><p>“Black.”</p><p>The intern nodded and left the room. She didn’t trust people that wore their joy so openly. That much happiness allowed others to walk all over you. She shrugged. She didn’t mind doing the walking.</p><p>Agatha opened her computer and watched it automatically sync with the sleek monitors on her desk. She set to work, saving her crisis-pondering for when she arrived home.</p><p>___________</p><p>The next two weeks passed in the same fashion, Agatha arrived late or later and did her own work, meeting with the others only when it was explicitly needed. Wake up, feed Se​​ñor Scratchy, go home, feed Se​​ñor Scratchy; rinse and repeat. She sprinkled a few meals for herself in there, ordered a ridiculous amount of items and a massive rabbit enclosure, and let herself fall back into a routine. One that, to her relief or disappointment, didn’t include any sight or sound from Rio.</p><p>The team was bearable. Jennifer remained snide and arrogant but Agatha had always respected a woman who didn’t shape herself to appease society. Lilia was discriminating in the way women became when they’d lived through decades and decided exactly who they would be for the rest of the ones they had left.</p><p>Alice was no-nonsense, her mind sharp, but she had a dry humor and seemed to be adjusting to the rest of them rather quickly. She took a liking to the intern: Agatha walked in most mornings to see them sharing a table in the kitchen while they drank coffee or walked through batches of evidence. She seemed to have taken it upon herself to make sure the boy received some real training.</p><p>The intern himself had turned out to be more tolerable than expected. It helped that he seemed to have a deep appreciation for Agatha and never failed to drop a coffee at her desk after his morning social. But he was also smart. Deceptively smart. He picked up on things quickly and had insights that she wouldn’t have expected someone so young to put together. He hadn’t tried to play music out loud after Agatha had threatened to toss his phone from the tenth-floor window and he only asked her every other day if he could hang another thing on their office walls.</p><p>She kept him to his corner but never said no.</p><p>Then one day he’d brought her coffee and held out a large potted pathos next to it.</p><p>She’d grimaced, pushed it away from herself, and taken the coffee, intent on avoiding whatever conversation he was aiming to start.</p><p>Instead of backing off, the intern had lifted it again.</p><p>“Can I put this on your side?” Before she could negate it he threw in: “I’ll water it!”</p><p>And she’d let him for reasons she still couldn’t put her finger on.</p><p>They’d closed the Senator’s case, gathering enough evidence for an arrest and eventual conviction. Most of the ground work had been done by other teams and Agatha hadn’t complained; politics were never a focal point of her interest.</p><p>They’d been given two new cases the same day of Treseder’s arrest. One was a joint case with the DEA and local police involving a sharp spike in deaths from laced heroin coming in through the Beltway.</p><p>The other was a twin pair of paintings stolen just before their intended exhibition at The National Gallery of Art. Once more, the field work was completed by other agents, their work being passed off every time they caught a lead or pulled new evidence. For actually interesting cases, Agatha found it grating.</p><p>In the closing brief for the gallery theft, solved within a week, Agatha had shared her irritation.</p><p>“Is there a reason we’re not mobilizing for these? I wasn’t aware I was signing up to be a desk jockey.”</p><p>To her surprise, Jennifer agreed.</p><p>“As much as I hate to back Agatha, I’m better at my job when I can be on-site and ensure proper evidence retrieval. The forensic team labeled the tool used to snap open the art crates as a crowbar and almost lost us the opportunity to trace the actual tool back to the source.”</p><p>Lilia nodded.</p><p>“I prefer to do the questioning; to have eyes on the crowds and scenes in-person rather than over a screen or photo.”</p><p>Alice had shrugged.</p><p>“I’ve never had to sit still for ten hours a day before. It actually sucks.”</p><p>Wanda had tilted her head in acquiescence.</p><p>“It was suggested that this team settle in before sending you out in the field. If you believe you can do so without embarrassing the Bureau,” She glanced between Agatha and Jennifer, “I’ll happily get your boots on the ground for the remainder of this drug trafficking case.”</p><p>Agatha caught the first part of that sentence and frowned.</p><p>“Who suggested it?”</p><p>The look in Wanda’s eyes made Agatha think there was more there than the one word she said:</p><p>“E-SAC.”</p><p>Agatha tried to look through her to the truth but Wanda wasn’t offering more.</p><p>The intern raised a hand.</p><p>“Will I be able to go into the field?”</p><p>A chorus of “nos” sounded even as Agatha shrugged and said “sure.” She received some disapproving looks and gave an affronted shrug.</p><p>From there, Agatha’s life became a little more interesting. She started her third week on Sunday at three in the morning, her shoes splashing through puddles of rainwater and soaking her navy slacks around her ankles. Her shoulders and the top of her head were soaked from the downpour before she could move from Alice’s car to the large warehouse awash with light.</p><p>She was going to have to request an agency vehicle. Having to ask for a pick-up had been nauseating and was only tolerable because Alice didn’t ask questions. She hadn’t said more than a ‘hello’ to Agatha after picking her up; it happened to be one more than Agatha’s preferred word count before noon.</p><p>Alice had prepared for the weather with a raincoat and thick boots and she was dry as bone as she followed Agatha inside.</p><p>Jennifer was already present amongst the first responders, her voice echoing loudly as she took the lead of the forensic team on site.</p><p>Alice stopped next to her and watched.</p><p>“I’m not sure she can commandeer a crime scene from the local police.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a chuckle.</p><p>“They’re the ones listening. Sharon is going to have an aneurysm.”</p><p>Alice laughed.</p><p>“Don’t sound so excited.”</p><p>“Why not? She lives to scold us.”</p><p>Lilia fell in on Agatha’s other side and she looked like a drowned dog.</p><p>“I hate the rain. This is our karma for questioning Maximoff.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed gloves from a box outside the boundary of the police line.</p><p>“If karma was real, I’d be dead. Let’s get this over with.”</p><p>___________</p><p>Agatha loved it. She worked the cases with tenacity, and, unlike her colleagues at the120th, her team was frighteningly competent. They’d built a fragile rapport when in range of those beyond their team and their varied expertise lent itself to a fast pace. She could see the others growing on one another. The conversations sometimes strayed into anecdotes and stories about their pasts. Other times, Agatha would see Lilia sitting with Alice and the intern at the kitchen table in the morning. Once, even Jennifer had sat down amongst them with a cup of organic yogurt and they’d spent the first thirty minutes of the day chatting.</p><p>Each time, Agatha walked by without comment. It wasn’t like they hadn’t tried. The intern waved at her every morning and the request for her to join only happened once or twice before her scoffed “no” had ended the attempts. Just because she was here did not mean that she would be <i>bonding</i> with anyone. She knew exactly how those relationships could fall apart and it wasn’t worth her effort.</p><p>Wanda stopped by their office when she could, but something big was taking up a large portion of her time. She had mentioned it in passing; suggested that they might end up on it, but no word came regarding what it might be for almost a month. Again, a month without sight nor sound of Rio.</p><p>Agatha completed her last batch of paperwork on the drug case and pushed them to the end of her desk. It wasn’t that she wanted to see Rio. That was out of the question. But she knew her ex-wife still worked in this building. It was odd that they’d never crossed paths, right?</p><p>The intern appeared in front of her with another plant and Agatha glared.</p><p>“Stop trying to decorate my office.”</p><p>Instead of asking, he had the audacity to step onto her side and place it on her filing cabinet.</p><p>“It’s Hedera Helix.”</p><p>Agatha scowled.</p><p>“Did you just cast a spell at me?”</p><p>The intern laughed, his dark eyes squinted as he looked at her.</p><p>“Yes. It’s a truth spell.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows.</p><p>“Oh? What are you trying to pull from me that you can’t just ask?”</p><p>He seemed to be pondering like he might only get one question. Try zero. His eyes lit up.</p><p>“I wanted to know more about your time at Quantico. You broke, like, every record and an instructor’s nose.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t stop the smile fast enough as she thought of Agent Treadwell. He had hated her from the moment she joined as a trainee until the day she took her Oath of Office.</p><p>“He deserved it.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure. What happened?”</p><p>Agatha was saved from answering when she heard the door in the war room open. Wanda stepped inside with two Special Agents Agatha had seen around but never spoken to.</p><p>She watched curiously until another figure revealed themselves behind Wanda. Agatha felt her body buzz, her nerves lighting up like a junkie as Rio walked in with a black sweater underneath a tan wool-plaid neck coat. Her slacks were flat tan and high-waisted and Agatha felt her mouth dry out as she stared. While Wanda and the agents slowed in the center of the room, Rio kept moving.</p><p>Agatha’s teeth clenched together as she met Rio’s eyes. There was something reserved in her expression that Agatha didn’t like.</p><p>The intern looked between Agatha and Rio several times before Rio slowed, her frame taking up the doorway to their office.</p><p>“William. Please join Wanda and the others.”</p><p>He seemed alarmed to be named and he nodded too many times as he scrambled for his notebook and slipped past Rio’s imposing form.</p><p>Rio closed the door behind him with finality and Agatha’s stomach churned, her synapses jumping to the obvious conclusion that something was wrong. She leaned to look around Rio and saw the rest of her team circling the conference table. She saw the briefest flicker of Wanda’s concerned expression toward her and Agatha found herself standing up behind her desk. Sitting for whatever was coming felt like a distinct disadvantage.</p><p>She tried for brevity though her tone was laced with agitation.</p><p>“Did Wanda need you to fire me for her? I never thought of you as a lapdog.”</p><p>Agatha tried to think of a single thing she’d done that would warrant that but couldn’t. Surprisingly.</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her expression a complex blend of apathy and concern, and Agatha stepped back. Proximity was not what she needed if she wanted to keep a clear head.</p><p>Rio stilled, eyes studying her closely.</p><p>“The team is being pulled in on a case. You’re being reassigned for the time being.”</p><p>A dark, gurgling feeling of betrayal burned a pit in her stomach.</p><p>“What the fuck does that mean?”</p><p>Rio’s hands slid into her pockets and she looked so nonchalant that Agatha’s palms itched to strangle her or slap her. She loathed this Rio.</p><p>“You’ll be brought back in as soon as this case is completed.”</p><p>Agatha let out an almost manic laugh, the sound loud enough to reach the ears of the group outside. She saw the intern’s eyes seek her out, followed by a sideways glance from Jennifer.</p><p>Agatha stood, encroaching on Rio’s space with the intent to pass her.</p><p>“Fat chance.”</p><p>Rio’s hand snatched her wrist before she could reach for the door.</p><p>“This isn’t a discussion, it’s an order. You can follow it or you can take leave with pay for the duration of the case.”</p><p>Agatha yanked her hand back, fury writhing in her chest.</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha jammed her fingers into Rio’s sternum. “Agent Vidal is giving me an order?” Agatha wanted to jab her again but Rio hadn’t responded to the first one. “Care to share why I’m not allowed to work on the team <i>you</i> dragged me back here to join?”</p><p>Rio gave her a warning look.</p><p>“Lower your voice, Agent Harkness.”</p><p>It felt like a slap in the face even more than whatever bullshit Rio and Wanda were currently playing at. She sneered, voice mocking as she lifted her hands for sure quotes.</p><p>“Agent Harkness.” She scoffed, speaking louder. “You want me to lower my voice? How about you tell me what the fuck is going on.”</p><p>Rio stared at her, eyes hard and unmoving.</p><p>“There is a concern that you will not be able to remain detached due to the nature of the case.”</p><p>Agatha’s mind tried to piece together whatever that meant, the words clinical, scrubbed clean of any trace of emotion.</p><p>“Why don’t you let me decide that for myself? Where do you get off swinging your dick around? This is Wanda’s team. I’d rather hear this from her.”</p><p>Agatha attempted to leave again and this time when Rio stopped her, it was through a hand on Agatha’s stomach. The blank look in Rio’s eyes had slipped toward mild desperation.</p><p>“Agatha. Please.”</p><p>Agatha shoved Rio’s hand away again, her mind flooded with rage that only Rio seemed capable of dragging out of her.</p><p>“Please. <i>What.</i>” She enunciated each word with a snap. “Either say it or get the fuck out.”</p><p>Rio moved subtly in front of the door.</p><p>“It’s a kid, Agatha. A trafficking case. A brother and sister were taken. The boy was killed.”</p><p>Agatha felt the air rush from her lungs, the fight leaving her body momentarily as the reality of the situation hit her. She looked down at the floor and tried to keep the world from spinning.</p><p>She grit her teeth. She should have known. This was Rio; this white wall behavior always preceded conversations regarding their son.</p><p>“You’re telling me that Wanda decided that I was unfit without speaking to me, then she brought you here to do the dirty work?” Agatha’s voice was truly raised now and she had no intention of concerning herself with propriety. She stepped into Rio’s face, eyes burning. “I am not some fragile thing to be packed away anytime things get difficult.”</p><p>Rio didn’t back down, her dark eyes on Agatha’s.</p><p>“It wasn’t Wanda.” Rio’s jaw rolled. “I made the call. I’m giving the order. If you can’t do this peacefully then I’ll enforce the leave with pay. Pack up, Agatha. You’ll receive notice when it’s time for you to return.”</p><p>Agatha all but snarled, her jaw working against the scream that wanted to tear from her throat. Agatha’s vision narrowed to a pinprick until it was just her and Rio. She flung out her hand, slamming Rio into the window of her office.</p><p>“Fuck you, Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha swung the door open and stormed out under the shocked stares of the gathered. The only one that didn’t seem surprised was Wanda and she tried to intervene.</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>Agatha let out a bitter laugh.</p><p>“Eat my ass, Maximoff.”</p><p>As she was passing the table, her eyes fell to the folders spread across the surface. Her heart fractured in her chest, her lungs felt constricted. She stared at the empty eyes of a little boy no older than five left carelessly in a dirt field.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned and the little boy’s face warped into Nicky’s in an instant. The brown, lifeless eyes became blue and the dirty-blonde hair became brown. Wanda stepped in front of her view but the damage was done.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe. She composed her expression because letting any of these people see her unravel was unacceptable. She felt like a brittle porcelain, like she would shatter at the lightest touch.</p><p>She swallowed the crawling anguish in her throat and turned toward the exit without another word.</p><p>Her vision swam in the elevator and she found herself cramped into the back as it sank toward the lobby, stopping almost every floor to pick up employees ready to leave for the day.</p><p>Agatha felt like she was being suffocated and she bumped several of the other passengers in her effort to escape as soon as the doors opened to the lobby.</p><p>She couldn’t get it out of her head. Nicky’s beautiful eyes turned dull and empty and dead. His bright life ripped away, his body buried deep in Oak Hill Cemetery facing the Potomac. Agatha could hardly feel the chilly whip of wind across her skin as she started a mindless walk in the direction of home.</p><p>Her cheeks stung and her vision was unfocused and she didn’t slow or stop. If she did she would falter and fall, and, despite the shell of a woman she’d become, that was still unacceptable.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a strained breath, bumping harshly into somebody as she passed by. She heard their muffled outcry but didn’t look back.</p><p>It took longer than it should for her to reach her street. Wrong turns and momentary pauses to catch her breath or furiously wipe at her eyes added an extra twenty minutes to the journey</p><p>Her legs carried her numbly to her front door and she looked up from the sidewalk. She wanted to laugh. She wanted to sob and scream and tear off her skin because it wasn’t fair. It didn’t make sense why her baby had to die, why she had to live the rest of her life with half her heart in the grave and the other continually showing up to remind her.</p><p>Agatha stopped several feet from the very disheveled Rio standing at her steps. All traces of apathy had been shredded: the woman before her had a look of utter heartbreak on her face.</p><p>Rio took a strained breath, her head shaking as she spoke.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have done that. Not there.”</p><p>Agatha looked away. She wiped her face again, wondering if the tears would ever stop.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. You were right. I can’t work the case. I’m not cut out for this anymore.”</p><p>She heard Rio move closer.</p><p>“It’s just this case.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. No matter how she looked at it she came to the same conclusion. If she had to be removed from cases due to the very real possibility that she might self-destruct, she had no business working in this field.</p><p>“And what? I get handheld through the rest of my career? Open your eyes, Rio. If I was any other agent I wouldn’t be here.” Agatha let out an empty chuckle, meeting Rio’s gaze. “I thought I could do this but—“ she shrugged. “I told you before. The person I was before Nicky, she died with him.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice broke on his name and Rio’s eyes went glassy with unshed tears. She looked wrecked, distraught, desperate. Everything she hadn’t been the first time Agatha told her she was leaving town.</p><p>It might have been the second-worst day of her life. She hadn’t understood why she’d done it then. She still didn’t know. She and Rio had been separated for three months, and had barely spoken to one another for six.</p><p>She’d knocked on her own door, waited for her wife to answer, and had told her she was going away. She wasn’t sure what she’d expected or hoped for, but Rio had just stared at her. Through her. The only thing she’d said was a monotone ‘do you need to get anything from inside?’ And Agatha had laughed through the devastation the words had left on her soul. She had turned and never looked back.</p><p>Rio had called her minutes later but Agatha hadn’t answered.</p><p>The Rio before her now seemed like a reflection of all of Agatha’s misery and pain. She looked like she was trying to compose herself, trying to find words, but she just gasped out a wet sigh.</p><p>“I didn’t stop you.” Rio pulled in a breath, eyes locking on Agatha’s. “I didn’t stop you from leaving the first time. I’m not making that mistake again.” Rio moved forward, fingertips touching lightly on Agatha’s jaw, sliding to her neck, holding. “I know we can’t— I know I have no right to ask you to stay this time, but I’m doing it.”</p><p>Agatha leaned into the touch, her instincts fraying, her heart thudding heavy in her chest. She reached forward and pulled Rio against her carefully, deliberately.</p><p>The warmth of the embrace felt so reminiscent of the people they’d been before, their hand placement a reflex from years of loving one another without restraint. Agatha’s hand slid through Rio’s hair at her neck to hold her head, her other arm wrapped tightly around her back.</p><p>Rio’s arms wound under, hands grasping Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>Agatha didn’t let go, didn’t allow herself to overthink or ask questions. These were the first arms that had held her and loved her and had never, ever hurt her. This was the woman who had seen the depths of Agatha’s suffering, the darkness of her past, the insecurities from a childhood lived without hope, the tragedy of her present.</p><p>Agatha withdrew only enough to cradle Rio’s face. She felt drunk on longing and loneliness and her answer to both was right in front of her.</p><p>She leaned in, their mouths brushing, but Rio spoke reverently in the space between them.</p><p>“Don’t kiss me unless you mean it, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha stilled, her eyes searching.</p><p>Rio had regained her composure slightly, her voice steady and sincere, her expression clear.</p><p>Agatha did mean it. But that wasn’t what Rio was saying. Not really.</p><p>Don’t kiss me unless you stay. Don’t kiss me unless you come home. Don’t kiss me unless you forgive me.</p><p>Agatha stepped back, her heart screaming in protest, and dropped her hands to her sides. She offered an empty smile and looked down, then returned her gaze.</p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>Agatha watched Rio’s pain retreat behind stoicism. She turned away before she could see her eyes go hollow.</p>

<p>Agatha spent the next several days in a stupor. The emotional toll of constantly living with shadows trailing her had become untenable. She had cried intermittently for an embarrassingly long portion of the week before the introspection careened into her at ninety and flattened her onto her bed. She thought about– truly considered– what she wanted. It was something she hadn’t done since Nicky’s death. It had never been an option because what she wanted was impossible.</p><p>It still was. Nicky wasn’t coming back. But she had to make a decision now. She was too tired to keep living with so much pain and the small pieces of hope she’d found the past month were enough to make her consider wanting something more.</p><p>She thought about the job and the excitement and purpose it gave her. She thought about Rio and how it had felt to hold her again. How it had felt to know that Rio would if only Agatha would too. She wasn’t sure it was possible. She’d taken all of her pain from the past five years and pushed it toward her memory of her ex-wife.</p><p>Agatha looked at her closet and stared down at the box that held all of Rio’s letters and the book of dried flowers. She stood, lightheaded because sustaining herself had not been her most recent priority, and sat down in front of the box.</p><p>She sifted through Rio’s letters until she reached the plastic sandwich bag at the bottom. She’d put the pieces of Rio’s first letter, the one she’d torn and crumpled and thrown around the room, in the bag for safekeeping.</p><p>Agatha carefully removed the pieces and began to puzzle it together. As she placed the upper left corner on the carpet, she saw Rio’s first words.</p><p>
<i>My Heart,<br/>
I will spend every moment apart with the regret that I did not stop you –”</i>
</p><p>Agatha swiped her hand through the pieces, throat tight, and dropped face into her hands. She wasn’t ready, wasn’t capable of handling the surge of emotions that would come from seeing what Rio had been saying to her for years. Agatha felt the guilt sevenfold and she carefully placed the pieces of the letters back in the ziploc bag.</p><p>With a very fragile grip on reality, Agatha picked up her phone and made a call.<br/>
____________</p><p>Noon the next day, Agatha was sitting on a comfortable loveseat with a basket of fidgets in the box at her feet and an ancient hag in front of her holding a pen and pad of paper.</p><p>Dr. Alder raised her brow, her pen tapping idly.</p><p>“I recall our last session ending rather poorly.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head back and forth with a shrug.</p><p>“Not my finest moment, no.”</p><p>Dr. Alder laughed.</p><p>“You said my office smelled like Rafflesia Arnoldi- something I had to google- and suggested I had already died of old age.”</p><p>Agatha nodded deeply, slowly, lips pursed.</p><p>“I did say that.”</p><p>Dr. Alder continued.</p><p>“You kicked over my box of fidgets as you left.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, hand coming up in defense.</p><p>“No, now that was an accident. I tripped.”</p><p>Dr. Adler looked at her in disbelief.</p><p>“You said, ‘have fun picking up your toys, you clown.”’</p><p>Agatha waved her hand away and let out a dismissive chuckle.</p><p>“What if we just– what if we put that behind us.” Agatha shifted in her seat. “Start over?”</p><p>Dr. Alder settled back, eyes piercing.</p><p>“I wouldn’t have allowed you back in my office if I wasn’t willing to see you, Agatha. But there are rules I’m going to expect you to follow if you actually want my help.” Agatha hated rules and Dr. Alder was perfectly aware. “One, I won’t tolerate the berating I received from you in our first attempts at therapy. Two, you have to want this, Agatha. You have to try. I can’t make you care about your healing. Three, if I ask you a question, you have to answer it. If you’re not ready to do so, you tell me you’re not ready.”</p><p>Agatha was visibly uncomfortable, her hands held tightly together in her lap.</p><p>“Is there any room for negotiation in there, or..?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Right. That’s fair.”</p><p>“You accept the terms?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. She was promising to roll over and show her soft underbelly.</p><p>“I accept the terms.”</p><p>Dr. Alder smiled.</p><p>“Fantastic, let’s start with why you’re here now?”</p><p>Agatha did. She talked about Rio finding her, about coming back to DC, about her job and the team. She told Alder about being removed from the case. About Rio.</p><p>“She told me not to unless I meant it.”</p><p>“Did you?”</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“It’s complicated.”</p><p>To her relief, Alder didn’t ask her how it was complicated. Instead, she switched the focus.</p><p>“Why do you think Rio was the one to remove you from the case?”</p><p>Agatha snorted out a laugh and then cleared her throat.</p><p>“I don’t know. It definitely didn’t help.”</p><p>Alder looked through her.</p><p>“What did you just think there before you lied to me?”</p><p>Agatha chewed on the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“Nothing, I mean— Rio just always thought she was good at breaking bad news to people. It was a running thing.”</p><p>“And she wasn’t?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twisted into a reminiscing grin.</p><p>“One time she was assigned to death notification duty for a case we were working on and she smiled.”</p><p>“When she received the assignment?”</p><p>“While she told them the news.”</p><p>Alder grimaced but proceeded.</p><p>“So why her? With things as strenuous as you say, why do you think she came?”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t going to touch that revelation with a ten-foot pole.</p><p>“I’m not ready to answer that.”</p><p>Instead of disappointment or reprimand, Alder looked proud and she smoothly changed topics.</p><p>Agatha tried to soothe the increasing sense of dread in her chest that she shouldn’t have done this; that the barely scabbed wounds, even after years, were going to tear from her skin and leave her bleeding.<br/>
___________</p><p>By the time that Agatha made it home it was one-thirty and she was exhausted. Her eyes hurt, her throat hurt, her chest hurt, and she was pretty certain any further visits to Dr. Alder would have her in a similar state.</p><p>She let herself into the safehouse and ignored the pang of disappointment that it still had yet to feel like a comfortable space. Even her shit apartment on Staten Island had felt like a harbor, a shelter from the haunts of her past. She’d been looking for places to move more permanently but none of them felt quite right and she’d canceled or missed every walkthrough that she’d scheduled. She couldn’t explain it to herself, not honestly, and so she didn’t think about it at all.</p><p>She went to Scratchy’s massive pen and released the latch to let him wander the house. He’d become a bright spot in her days even though he had probably caused hundreds of dollars in damages to the property. Agatha was hoping those damages wouldn’t be found immediately after she left.</p><p>He wasn’t incredibly cuddly but he never sprung away or hid for extended periods of time. He also made her laugh– real laughter that came from joy instead of derision or mockery– and it had felt like the wakening of a rarely used muscle.</p><p>As Senor Scratchy started to roam, Agatha glided into her kitchen to see if she had options for food. She knew before she opened the doors to the fridge and pantry that she had maybe a half-box of pasta, two pieces of stale bread, and milk. She stared at the empty shelves with a heavy sigh leaving her lips.</p><p>Senor Scratchy scampered between her legs and she yelped, her head slamming into the open cabinet. She growled out a string of curses and she held pressure to her skull as it throbbed. She was still grimacing when she heard a knock at her door.</p><p>Agatha froze. Three people knew where she was staying and there was no way that Alice had decided to invite herself over. She slowly made her way toward the door, eyes on the stained glass window, and frowned at the shadow she saw swaying back and forth. It was taller than Wanda and Rio and rather. . . gangly.</p><p>Agatha yanked open the door to reveal the intern standing awkwardly outside. He had a backpack on one shoulder and held up a hand in greeting.</p><p>“Hi, I wanted to–”</p><p>Agatha closed the door in his face and turned back toward her kitchen before the knock came again.</p><p>“Um, Agent Harkness?” Another knock. “I can be really persistent and I know that’s a really annoying characteristic to you. It might be best if you at least hear me out now instead of twenty minutes from now.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders dropped and her head fell back as she groaned loudly. She turned and yanked the door open.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>The intern looked past her.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>He shrugged  the strap of the bag on his shoulder, looking back at it pointedly.</p><p>“I have some files I think you’ll want to see and they technically shouldn’t have left the office.”</p><p>Agatha stared at him for several seconds, pondering slamming the door in his face again. Curiosity got the better of her;it was truly one of her worst qualities. She stepped aside and let the intern into the townhome.</p><p>He walked in with all the audacity of his generation and didn’t ask her preference as he turned into the living room. He sat down on the couch and started pulling out documents from his bag, his eyes trailing curiously around the room. They landed on the enclosure but he said nothing as Agatha stood with her arms crossed opposite him.</p><p>“How did you manage to sneak these out? How did you figure out where I lived?”</p><p>The intern set out two separate stacks.</p><p>“Agent Maximoff and Agent Maximoff.”</p><p>Fucking Wanda. Always letting others do her dirty work. She’d been exceptionally good undercover from her early days in the field. It was never hard for her to get what she wanted and Agatha had hated and respected her for the skill.</p><p>“Sharon will be furious.”</p><p>The intern laughed.</p><p>“She’s already filed paperwork.” He pointed to one of the stacks. “Agent Maximoff gave me a copy of the current case. She didn’t say much about it but said it was your call.”</p><p>Of course. Put the onus on Agatha.</p><p>“And the other?”</p><p>The intern seemed excited.</p><p>“It’s so interesting!” He seemed to rethink his words. “Okay, it’s actually sad because this lady has gone missing, but none of the pieces seem to fit together and the local law enforcement hasn’t made any headway.”</p><p>Seemed a bit pedestrian for the FBI.</p><p>“Why are we involved?”</p><p>The intern flipped the first file open.</p><p>“Georgina “Georgie” Hartwell, 23, tech heiress and travel influencer. She disappeared forty-eight hours ago from a nightclub in Greece. There’s footage of her leaving with a man but he doesn’t show up in any database so far.”</p><p>Agatha tried to flatten the spike of interest. She was not going to be patronized.</p><p>“So they sent you to round out the b-team?”</p><p>The intern frowned, looking between the case file and her.</p><p>“Why would you be on the b-team? You’re one of the best agents to come out of Quantico in fifty years.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. She remained standing– feeling like stillness in that moment would unravel her– and began to pace.</p><p>“You have no idea who I am, kid. Whatever data you could pull or questions you could ask don’t account for the past five years.” She could see it in his eyes; she knew what he was about to ask and she shook her head. “You should go. The team will teach you more than I ever will.”</p><p>The intern didn’t seem inclined to move. In fact, he settled further into the couch and pulled the missing person’s case into his lap.</p><p>“With all due respect, you are the one I want to work with.”</p><p>“Well, I have no interest in working with you.” Agatha tilted her head pointedly toward the door. “I may not even come back.”</p><p>The intern frowned.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>She didn’t answer immediately, memories of the past two days enough to sink her into an uncomfortable melancholy. She looked away to compose herself. When she turned back, the intern was no longer looking at her.</p><p>His eyes were locked onto something on her floor. He reached out a hand and Agatha saw Senor Scratchy bouncing toward him.</p><p>“It’s <i>so</i> cute. Oh my god.” The intern gently scratched at the top of the bunny’s head. “Who is this perfect creature?”</p><p>Agatha watched closely as the boy’s focus narrowed to just Senor Scratchy and his soft fur. He was naive and painfully enthusiastic and terribly annoying. She wanted to pick him up and drag him to the door with a few scathing words about his presumptiveness, but there was something there that held her tongue. Instead of answering his question, Agatha finally sat down.</p><p>“Listen to me.” She waited until the intern’s head lifted, his attention focusing on her. “I’m going to ask you a question. You will answer me honestly, entirely, and you won’t ask me anything in return. Afterwards, I will <i>consider</i> looking at this case before I throw you out.”</p><p>The intern didn’t even weigh the price before he agreed.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to roll her eyes but instead she kept them locked onto his, searching every facet of his expression.</p><p>“What did Wanda say to you before she sent you here?”</p><p>The intern continued scratching the top of Senor Scratchy’s head idly and he answered like he never considered not doing so.</p><p>“She said that you would be mean and difficult and that I shouldn’t accept your refusal. She told me that you might be thinking of leaving but that you never would; that it wasn’t in your nature.”</p><p>Every word from his mouth grated against her nerves. Wanda had always been tragically good at dismantling the people around her and naming their parts. She’d clocked Agatha after a month at Quantico and Agatha had never forgiven her.</p><p>The intern continued.</p><p>“She told me that what I could learn from you would be invaluable and that your methods, while offbeat, often resulted in extraordinary outcomes.” He seemed to pause then, his first sign of discomfort, and Agatha leaned forward. They were getting to the meat of it then. The boy pressed on. “She said there were three items off-limits if I wanted to have a chance.”</p><p>He trailed off and Agatha felt the churning of gray anticipation in her chest.</p><p>“Go on.”</p><p>“I feel like this is counterintuitive to my instructions.”</p><p>“Spit it out.”</p><p>The intern sighed.</p><p>“She said not to ask about what happened at the office. And to not mention Director Vidal or ask about the years you were on sabbatical.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to snark back when her brain caught up to a specific detail of the statement.</p><p>“Did you just say, ‘Director?’”</p><p>The intern seemed surprised that that was what Agatha narrowed in on.</p><p>“Um. Yes? Did you not know?” He gave a thoughtful look. “Actually that would make you throwing her into our office wall make sense.”</p><p>That explained Rio’s lack of presence. The Director worked most days from the Hoover Building. Agatha shot him a disdainful look.</p><p>“I did not throw her.”</p><p>He gave her a clearly disbelieving raise of his brow but shrugged.</p><p>“I mean, she seemed super pissed off about it. Jennifer said something about you finally being fired for insubordination but Lilia said that wasn’t going to happen.”</p><p>Agatha felt somewhat ill at the reality that so many people had been so close to peeling back her skin and seeing what was inside.</p><p>“Anything else?”</p><p>For the first time, the intern’s expression turned shrewd.</p><p>“I’ll give you a play by play but you have to agree to look over this case with me.”</p><p>Agatha sneered, taking in his smug little face.</p><p>“You don’t have an iota of self-preservation.” He simply waited, his smile bright, and Agatha shook her head. “Fine. I’ll look at the case.”</p><p>The intern’s smile got impossibly wide and she wanted to ask him to wear a bag on his head but he’d probably think she was joking.</p><p>He set the file beside him on the couch.</p><p>“After you gently moved Director Vidal to the side and made very little fuss about leaving, she stood in our office for a few seconds. I couldn’t really see her but she wasn’t moving at all. When she left, she looked, like, so angry. She told Agent Maximoff to carry on and moved out pretty fast. Then Jennifer made her comment about you getting fired and Lilia said you wouldn’t. Agent Maximoff told them to refocus and we got into the case.” The intern grimaced. “Honestly, it was a painful one to look at. I’ve been having a hard time with it so Agent Maximoff pulled me off.” He held out his hands. “Now here I am!”</p><p>It wasn’t terrible. If nobody discussed her history in all its gory detail, she could probably show her face again. She was sure there would be some kind of consequence for her actions against Rio but she would take it in stride.</p><p>Agatha stared hard into the looping pattern of the hardwood floors until the intern cleared his throat.</p><p>“Um, do you want to start by reading through the casefile?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, lips pursing as she pulled open a small drawer in the coffee table and tugged out a stack of take-out menus.</p><p>“Order something.”</p><p>She tossed the stack into his lap and snatched the file from the couch. If she was going to be relegated to solving international crimes in her living room, she wanted to do so without starving.</p><p>The intern shuffled through, bemused, as Agatha started in on what had been gathered so far.</p><p>Agatha began with the paperclipped stack of identified attendees at the club the night the woman went missing, then flipped to the prints from the CCTV footage to pick out who interacted with the victim and suspect on the security cameras.</p><p>By the time their Thai food arrived, the stone that had been growing heavy and mossy in Agatha’s chest, intent on crushing her from the inside, had slowed its progress.</p><p>She was forty pages deep in the file, food she’d barely looked at having grown cold in front of her, when the intern flicked on a light.</p><p>She blinked, looking around, and noted that the sun was setting and the room had begun to dim. The intern sat back down, his notebook spread on the table, and seemed as if he planned to bunker down for the night on her living room sofa.</p><p>She closed her file, eyes narrowing.</p><p>“You don’t have a life to get to?”</p><p>The intern shrugged, barely looking up from his notebook.</p><p>“I already told my boyfriend I would be home late.”</p><p>Boyfriend. It wasn’t a shock. The intern wore tighter pants than the entirety of their women-dominated team and more make-up than half of them. Not that Agatha wanted to feed into stereotypes but, come on.</p><p>“That’s a bad habit to build.”</p><p>The intern didn’t heed the warning.</p><p>“I do my best thinking at night.”</p><p>And that had been the end of it. Both of them sat in Agatha's borrowed living room until seven in the afternoon pouring over the evidence and discussing possible motives.</p><p>They called it a night when the intern yawned for the fifth time and Agatha had pointed at the door.</p><p>“Go home to your boyfriend. I’ll see you at work tomorrow.”</p><p>___________</p><p>Agatha stepped through the doors to their common space and ignored the immediate onset of eyes. The intern and Alice were at their designated table in the kitchen and Lilia and Jen looked through their office windows like Agatha was a zoo animal.</p><p>She ignored them as normal, her expression lilting toward arrogance, and walked into her office after four days away. She felt a strange sense of calm as she took in the interns many posters and the perfectly healthy potted plants surrounding her desk. She frowned at the newest addition, a snake plant, and decided between tossing it or being, once more, impressed with the boy’s temerity.</p><p>She’d barely had time to sit down and drop her notes on her desk before Wanda was breezing in. She looked concerned, her eyes seeking answers, and Agatha turned her face away before she could find anything.</p><p>“What can I do for you, Maximoff?”</p><p>Her voice was saccharine and far too friendly.</p><p>Wanda closed the door behind her and stood tall, her hands pocketed in her deeply-red suit.</p><p>“You remember when I told you there were failsafes in place?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, eyes not leaving her screen.</p><p>“I’m way ahead of you.” Agatha passed over a bill and a note from Dr. Alder. “That should check your boxes.”</p><p>Wanda took the pages and scanned them briefly, then returned her eyes to Agatha.</p><p>“It’s a start.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced and she leaned back in her chair, fingers steepling on her stomach.</p><p>“A start? Do you need me to write a formal apology?” When Wanda didn’t immediately say no, Agatha laughed. “You can expect that when I’m dead. I’ll have it bequeathed to you in my will but it will be performed by a mime.”</p><p>For the first time since Wanda had drawn her back into this world, she looked truly frustrated. Wanda had always been patient, had always given people far too much leash to choke her with; it seemed she had finally learned from that mistake. Wanda turned and closed the door, cutting off the chatter from the rest of the team.</p><p>“Agatha, you are testing my tolerance. I want you on this team as much as I know that you want to be here. But I cannot have my leadership questioned; Rio cannot have her leadership questioned.” Wanda’s jaw clenched, her irritation plain. “You didn’t just show flagrant insubordination in front of your team, you did it in front of two agents that can carry that information to the rest of this office.”</p><p>Agatha crammed the guilt under her ribs where the rest of her suffering lived and offered Wanda a painted smile.</p><p>“Then fire me, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes flashed dangerously and Agatha waited for her to call her bluff.</p><p>Instead, Wanda withdrew.</p><p>“Director Vidal is waiting for you in her office.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, her regret instant and heavy in her gut. She wasn’t ready to see Rio. She was never ready to see Rio. Surely this could be settled between them.</p><p>“Wanda–”</p><p>Wanda turned toward the door.</p><p>“Try to look contrite on your way there, Agatha. It’ll curb the rumors.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her elbows onto her desk, her face falling into her hands as she groaned. She considered ignoring the summons but the possibility that Rio might come to her instead stifled that thought.</p><p>With far more composure than she felt, Agatha stood from her desk. She tugged at the white turtleneck and straightened out her brown blazer, clearing her throat.</p><p>She walked the path she’d just taken, ignoring even more pointed looks from the team on her way out. She knew the WFO innately, muscle-memory leading her toward the defacto office belonging to the standing Director. Before she’d left, it had been semi-inhabited by a geriatric man that still somehow held onto his full head of hair at sixty-four. Dannith had been a pain in her ass, a stickler for rules, nearly as bad as Sharon, but he’d liked Agatha.</p><p>He’d even invited her to join his monthly poker game where the buy-in was higher than her yearly salary and had only just grasped that she wasn’t paid enough to make it a standing commitment.</p><p>She’d seen his obituary two years prior. She had not gone to his funeral.</p><p>Agatha strolled onto the Eighth floor, chin high, and her eyes cast over row after row of senior offices, their names stenciled in gold on matte-white glass within the wooden doors. She saw Wanda’s office and rolled her eyes, continuing her death march toward the Director’s doors.</p><p>There were multiple senior agents in the halls and each seemed far more aware of her than she’d have preferred. It was possible that Wanda’s words were getting to her but she was never inclined to agree with the woman if she could help it.</p><p>She reached the wooden, double-doors and didn’t slow or knock before twisting the handle and letting herself in.</p><p>It would be easy to play off as a sign of disregard or disrespect, but Agatha knew that if she had knocked, if she had waited for Rio to call her in, she would have entered at a disadvantage.</p><p>She stepped into a nearly dim office, the blinds drawn and the overhead lights off. A single lamp, the computer screens, and the slits in the blinds were the only sources of light in the room.</p><p>Rio was sitting haloed by all three, the golden sunlight and the burnt-orange lamp casting a pretty bronze on her skin while the cool-toned computer lights sharpened the lines of her jaw and nose. Agatha’s mouth dried out. Rio wore a simple, white button-up shirt, the sleeves rolled to her elbows to reveal olive skin and toned, slender arms. Her suit jacket was wrapped around the back of her chair rather carelessly, the shoulders of it creased.</p><p>Rio didn’t look up, didn’t react to her abrupt entrance, and Agatha tried to settle her slowly-increasing heart rate. She closed the door behind her and didn’t wait to be asked to sit down, her body falling into the high-backed seat across from Rio.</p><p>Still, Rio said nothing, her hands typing rapidly across her keyboard. Seconds passed and Agatha waited. Then thirty seconds. Agatha wasn’t one to fold even with a poor hand.</p><p>After a minute, Agatha’s patience wore out. She wasn’t interested in playing mind games that she didn’t initiate. She stood.</p><p>“Can’t say I didn’t try.”</p><p>“Sit down, Agatha.”</p><p>That voice. Agatha’s skin tingled, her hairs standing on end as the quiet, commanding tone seeped into her skull and took hold. Memories echoed in vivid detail, that same voice used in far different circumstances. Agatha felt warm.</p><p>Rio had always exuded control, even when she was at her most erratic or chaotic, even in their shared, youthful idiocy. Behind closed doors, she had laid waste to Agatha’s resolve and taken her apart with terrifying ease.</p><p>
<i>“You’re taking me so well, sweetheart.”</i>
</p><p>The voice. It was always her voice that shredded Agatha’s coherent thoughts into mindless words and sounds babbled into pillows, into the skin of Rio’s throat.</p><p>
<i>”That’s it, darling. Come for me.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha took a steadying breath before she turned back. She wasn’t going to listen. Fuck Rio and fuck her stupid voice.</p><p>Then she saw her eyes, finally lifted from their previous task. They bore into Agatha, daring her to disobey; so dark and heavy in the low light of the room.</p><p>Agatha sat hard, knees all but giving out. She gripped the arms of the chair tightly. She said nothing because she didn’t trust that her voice wouldn’t betray her.</p><p>Rio watched her, studied her, and Agatha breathed through it with a heavy-thudding heart and lungs functioning at half-capacity.</p><p>When Rio looked away, back to her work, her agile fingers flying across the keyboard, Agatha snapped.</p><p>“You’re wasting my time.”</p><p>Rio glanced over at her, a small smirk turning up her lips.</p><p>“I’m making it look real, Agatha.” Rio completed whatever correspondence she’d been working on and returned her attention across the desk. “You are being formally reprimanded for your recalcitrance. You will sit in here for ten minutes and you will leave looking like I shit in your cereal.”</p><p>Agatha scowled.</p><p>“I’d rather you shit in my cereal.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes didn’t light up with her smile but she looked far too pleased as she took in Agatha’s anger.</p><p>“Good. There’s the look.”</p><p>Agatha Harkness did, one hundred percent, enjoy praise. She loved to be worshiped and adored and, from Rio, it had become a need.</p><p>Agatha pressed her thighs together. Rio’s voice vibrated through her ribcage and into a growing heat in her belly. She grit her teeth.</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes, caught in the motion of Agatha’s body, returned to her face.</p><p>“Stop?”</p><p>Agatha wanted to scream. Rio was a vengeful bitch; always had been. Her hurts or slights were always reflected tenfold, her punishments devastating. Agatha had been near-feral for this side of Rio. Often in their relationship, Agatha would prod and poke this creature to the surface, draw her out and let it ravage her.</p><p>She really needed to regain her composure. Her mouth formed words meant to wound.</p><p>“I thought you wouldn’t. Not unless I meant it.”</p><p>It was a cruel, highly inappropriate means of turning the tables but Agatha was seconds away from launching herself across the desk to fuck or kill her ex-wife and neither one would serve her well.</p><p>Rio’s expression shuttered, the lines of her face tightening as her jaw flexed. The mask only lasted seconds before the fury burned through it. Rio pushed her chair back but didn’t stand.</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>That wasn’t what Agatha had expected from throwing Rio’s words into her face. Her nervous system took quite a hit, her limbs buzzing, her skin overheating. She listened because she could do nothing else. She moved because she had to. Rio’s command felt like a metal collar on her throat, a stone wall at her back.</p><p>She stood, slowly, and walked to place herself in the space left between Rio and her desk. She presented as defiant but both of them knew better.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were burning with a well-earned arrogance. Her face was drawn in a hungry glare as she nodded her head toward Agatha.</p><p>“Sit.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a breath, a near-gasp, as her eyes tracked the soft planes of Rio’s throat, the sharp cut of her jaw, the power that radiated from every line of her body.</p><p>She sat on the desk, the wood edge pressing against the backs of her legs. She resisted the need to press her thighs together again, the ache between them nearly unbearable.</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“Director Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands pressed flat against the cool, wooden surface on either side of her but they did nothing to ground her.</p><p>Her own voice that breathed out was an ancient one; unused, pressed into the recesses of the person she used to be. It was a question, an invitation, a dare. It was a whisper that begged for trouble.</p><p>“Director.”</p><p>Rio’s hands curled tightly against the armrests, her head tilting.</p><p>“That’s it.” Rio’s voice was rough. Her chest rose and fell at a slightly elevated rate and Agatha could see her ex-wife’s restraint fraying quickly. “I expect you to be well-behaved moving forward, Agent Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed the moan that touched the back of her tongue. She was entirely consumed.</p><p>“I don’t believe you. You prefer me—“</p><p>“Compliant?” Rio stood slowly, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s face. The action put her inches away, her body heat radiating out, searing Agatha’s skin. “Obedient?”</p><p>Agatha’s hips shifted against her will, her lips parting slightly. She closed her eyes against the heady mortification that razed through her chest. She felt Rio move closer and she parted her legs without thought.</p><p>Rio stepped between them but didn’t touch, hands settling on the desk inches from Agatha’s hips and hands.</p><p>“You always were such a <i>brat.</i>” Rio’s breath was hot against Agatha’s ear, her voice throaty and raw and filthy. “You never knew how to do what you were told.”</p><p>Agatha choked on a whimper, her temple leaning against Rio’s jaw as she tried to drag herself to lucidity. The feverish press of skin did not help and she curled her fingers painfully around the edge of the desk. It took every inch of her will to keep them there. She scrabbled for any leverage.</p><p>“Where’s the fun in that, Director?”</p><p>Rio pulled back. Agatha thought she had found some success until she saw the deadly glimmer of satisfaction in Rio’s eyes.</p><p>With a graceful step away, her hands withdrawing, Rio offered Agatha a sharp smile.</p><p>“That should be about time.” Rio moved to the cabinet on the other side of her office and tugged a metal drawer open, her back to Agatha. “That will be all, Agent Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha felt like she’d been drenched in ice water. Her teeth slammed shut, her chest heaved silently, and she straightened to her feet. Fuck. <i>Fuck!</i></p><p>Agatha hated losing. She hated losing to Rio even more.</p><p>With the tattered scraps of her dignity in tow, Agatha stormed from the office and slammed the door behind her.</p><p>——————</p><p>The rest of the day had Agatha in a horrendous mood. She walked to her office like a storm cloud, expression thunderous, and said nothing to the curious intern that stared at her every other minute. Even with his propensity for disregarding Agatha’s rudeness, he did not seem inclined to interrupt her fuming.</p><p>She spent the next several hours in silence, her eyes glued to the screen as she picked apart the lives of four individuals who had spoken with their victim the night she disappeared.</p><p>The intern had two patrons that spoke to the possible suspect and he was compiling a stack of printed papers to the right of his desk.</p><p>The tension in her chest and the discomfort between her thighs didn’t dissipate despite her best efforts.</p><p>Those efforts did include thoughts of retaliation; and those thoughts sometimes (always) veered into dangerous territory: visceral memories playing through her mind without end.</p><p>Agatha was no stranger to taking control with Rio even if the roles were often opposite. Sometimes, when Rio was wound so tightly from sleepless nights or a challenging case, she’d give Agatha this look. It was hard to describe with words, something like a plea, something like desperation, but Agatha had always known it when it appeared.</p><p>Sometimes she’d been rough, demanding; her hands like iron on Rio’s hips and throat and thighs. Watching Rio’s spine curl in submission, watching her fall apart, it had been intoxicating. A goddess cowed.</p><p>Other times, more rarely, the <i>look</i> would be filled with this intense longing and Agatha would be so, so tender with her. She’d watch Rio be swept up by soft, pretty words and the lightest of touches. It was an experience that, early on, had led to awkward days after where neither was sure where they stood with one another. Because Agatha was not gentle. And Rio was not fragile. But they’d each fit the roles so well.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and took a shallow breath.</p><p>The intern’s voice cut through the haze.</p><p>“Are you okay? You look like you might pass out.”</p><p>Agatha ground her teeth together.</p><p>“Yes. I’m fine.” Agatha stood and ignored the wet slide of her thighs. “I’m leaving. Let me know if you find anything of interest.”</p><p>The intern looked at the clock.</p><p>“It’s only two-thirty.”</p><p>“Wow, thank you intern. I’m so impressed that you can read letters <i>and</i> numbers.”</p><p>He frowned at her as Agatha pushed her way out of their shared office. She needed to get absolutely clocked by the cold wind before she melted into a puddle on the floor.</p><p>Wanda, still working from the war room table, looked up as she exited.</p><p>“Agatha, a word.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to bite back and argue and possibly pull her chair from under her but she liked to keep the spectacles as a rarity. They had more impact that way. She slowed beside Wanda and waited silently.</p><p>Wanda placed her pen in the pages of the document she was sifting through to hold her spot. She gave Agatha a look.</p><p>“You haven’t settled on a new place yet.”</p><p>Agatha did not want to engage in this topic; she hardly knew what her own answers should be.</p><p>“No. Haven’t found an apartment that’s close enough.”</p><p>“You have an agency vehicle now.”</p><p>Agatha’s frustration fizzled and swayed in her chest. It was distracting instead of a catalyst for her normally sharp words. She shrugged.</p><p>“I‘ll keep looking.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression softened and Agatha was shaking her head before she could ask.</p><p>“Don’t waste your breath. I’m not moving in with your perfect, little family.”</p><p>Wanda grimaced.</p><p>“You don’t have to… but the US Marshals have requested use of the safe house for a high-level witness. Please, just accept the offer. It’s only temporary and you can look for a place this week; we’ll never have to discuss this again if you find one.”</p><p>—————</p><p>Agatha had looked. She’d taken four tours and had not been able to bite the bullet to live in an apartment with vertical slat blinds or a carpeted kitchen or a gold-dyed granite bathroom sink. One of the apartments just hadn’t had windows and she’d left without a word to the landlord giving the tour.</p><p>By Thursday of the next week, Agatha had accepted her fate with deep, seething irritation. Wanda cornered her in her office when the others had left for lunch, her smile overly bright.</p><p>“Vis and I are happy to help you move your things.”</p><p>Agatha would need help; Senor Scratchy’s enclosure was heavier than it had any right to be. But she also did not know how to broach the topic of the literal rabbit that she would be bringing with her and the words never came out in that conversation or over text Saturday when Agatha was waiting for the couple to arrive.</p><p>She’d packed her one suitcase and then had bought two more to fit her old and new clothing. The box with Rio’s letters she had already put in her own vehicle.</p><p>She heard conversation outside her door and grimaced, her hand wrapped around the handle of Scratchy’s carrying crate.</p><p>There was a knock at the door and Agatha felt unease spill into the cavernous spaces in her heart. Regret flooded in behind and she rapidly considered if maybe the shoebox of an apartment would be feasible for her. She was frozen, hand clammy and heart racing, when the knock came again.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Wanda’s voice grated against her ears even as she felt the rapid patter of her heart decrease. She leaned forward and yanked the door open.</p><p>Wanda was standing on her porch in jeans and a hoodie, two steaming paper cups in either hand. Her smile was painfully sincere as she held one out.</p><p>“The cider in Old Town has always been better than what they serve near us.”</p><p>Vision was standing absurdly tall beside her looking like an accountant on Christmas vacation. He had on a red LL Bean sweater with a golden hatch pattern and gold-brown slacks to match. His distinctly blonde hair hung around his forehead and he offered her an overjoyed smile.”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness! It is such a pleasure to see you again.”</p><p>Agatha offered a feigned smile back.</p><p>“You too. Still crunching numbers or whatever you do?”</p><p>Vision, as always, had no qualms ignoring Agatha’s mocking tone or lackluster greeting. Sometimes she wondered if it even registered to him.</p><p>“I am a partner now.” He winked. “So, yes!”</p><p>Agatha already wanted to rip her hair out and stuff it in her ears. She held up Senor Scratchy instead.</p><p>“I have a rabbit.”</p><p>Wanda and Vision both tilted their heads comically in unison, their eyes landing on the ball of fluff in the crate.</p><p>Vision reached a hand toward it, smile widening.</p><p>“How exciting!”</p><p>Wanda was silent a bit longer like she was trying to put something together in her brain. Agatha saw when it clicked. The warm smile became tinged with sadness and Wanda’s eyes lifted to hers.</p><p>Agatha waited for the comment or question that would send her back to therapy several days early but Wanda said nothing beyond,</p><p>“He’s really cute, Agatha.”</p><p>Neither made a quip about her lack of warning, nor did they ask about his proclivity for chewing on the legs of chairs.</p><p>Vision held out his hand.</p><p>“I’ll give him the best seat in the house. Him being…?”</p><p>He left room for Agatha to fill in the name and she said it quickly.</p><p>“Senor Scratchy.”</p><p>Vision’s voice boomed joyfully as he took the crate from her hand.</p><p>“Senor Scratchy!”</p><p>For being the smartest man Agatha had likely ever met, he was severely oblivious.</p><p>She saw the way the name had rocked Wanda, the woman now standing so still on her doorstep, looking like she was about to do something horrific like try to hug her.</p><p>Agatha turned back inside before that could happen. She stuffed her heaviest suitcase into Wanda’s hands and breezed past her with the other two. Her wrists strained as the suitcases clattered unevenly down the steps.</p><p>She placed them in the trunk and moved so Wanda could do the same.</p><p>Vision came around and clasped his hands together.</p><p>“What’s next!?”</p><p>Agatha led them inside to the only remaining items: the now partially-re-boxed enclosure, an enormously large bag of hay that Agatha had purchased online without checking the size. It barely fit in the tub she’d purchased. There was another tub with Scratchy’s remaining toys and resources that Wanda was able to pick up on her own.</p><p>In all, putting the rest in the trunk of Agatha’s SUV took about five minutes. It was a pathetic amount of personal items and she ignored the way both Vision and Wanda looked for more.</p><p>Agatha tugged open the driver’s side door.</p><p>“Same address?”</p><p>Vision and Wanda had moved into a little townhome in Georgetown around the time Agatha and Wanda had become partners. She’d had to listen to Wanda wax on and on about the perfect red-brick face and the refurbished historical architecture every morning for weeks. It was a nice place, she’d been there dozens of times, but either Wanda and Vision had purchased a nearby home or they’d moved. There was no space in Georgetown to have a guesthouse on a property.</p><p>Wanda pulled out her phone as she walked toward her vehicle.</p><p>“We had to upsize. I’ll text you the new address.”</p><p>Agatha closed the door behind her, cutting off the sounds of the river and the mild traffic. The Tahoe still smelled like fresh leather and she sank into it with a sigh. Her anxiety only grew as she turned her car on.</p><p>Wanda’s text came through and Agatha let out a defeated laugh. Potomac. Of course. She pulled up the address on her phone and felt only mild relief that their house wasn’t in the same neighborhood that Rio currently lived in.</p><p>Agatha dissociated for the duration of the drive, her mind feeling entirely separate from the body that was piloting her vehicle. The familiar route and the impending arrival in a city that no longer felt welcoming had sweat beading on her forehead and spine. She wasn’t ready to see the park they’d walked to near-daily or the little school playground Rio had almost broken bones on.</p><p>Agatha breathed out a chuckle. Even now, seven years later, she could smell the crisp air and remember the crunching sounds of their boots in the snow. Nicky was dwarfed by his snow-suit and the only visible part of his face had been his eyes. He was chasing Rio around—waddle-running like a penguin due to his layers— as both of them scream-laughed.</p><p>Snowy wood chips had been flying in every direction and every time the pair passed Agatha, Rio’s eyes would slide to her, her brilliant glee turning soft before she refocused, intent on not being caught.</p><p>As she grew winded, she let Nicky get close before she leapt toward the monkey bars with careless abandon. As any right mind would expect, her gloved hands and velocity had Rio flinging feet forward, her arm dropping back to catch her instinctively as her back slammed into the frozen ground. She’d landed hard enough Agatha had been torn between startled laughter and concern.</p><p>Nicky had collapsed on top of Rio, giggling out of control as one of her arms weakly wrapped around him.</p><p>By the time Agatha arrived, Rio was sucking in lungfuls of air, her eyes a little watery even as she laughed through every breath. She’d given Agatha a cheeky smile and that had been all it took for the humor to overtake them both.</p><p>Agatha had laughed until she couldn’t breathe and, any time she grew close to coming down, Nicky or Rio would restart the cycle with a snort or a giggle.</p><p>It had been such a happy day.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, hands tightening on the wheel.</p><p>She’d had so many happy days. Maybe that was it. Maybe she’d used her lifelong quota of happy days in the years she’d been able to hold Nicky in her arms. The years she’d loved recklessly, fearlessly.</p><p>Call her selfish, but she was certain it wasn’t enough.</p>

<p>Agatha slowed in front of a long, paved driveway that led up to a decently-sized, colonial, brick manor. It was stunning and clearly well-maintained if the vibrant colors of the building and landscape were anything to go by. She’d say it was opulent, gaudy, but Wanda and Vision had somehow managed to simplify and subdue the more ostentatious elements where needed.</p><p>The driveway looped in front of the house and split, one lane leading to the garage and another that continued on behind the house.</p><p>Wanda pulled up beside her and rolled down her window.</p><p>“Take the path to the left. There’s a covered parking spot in the back near the guest house.”</p><p>Agatha rolled into the driveway, lips twisting into a grimace when Wanda could no longer see her. She drove past the main house and took in her new, temporary home for the first time.</p><p>It was tucked away and given privacy due to large trees and bushes that cut between itself and the main manor. There was a multi-colored brick path that connected the two. Agatha pulled into the covered parking space and tried to get a better view.</p><p>It was quaint, a picket fence surrounding a white house with rust-red shutters. It looked older than the manor but still well-kept and freshly painted.</p><p>A careful, quiet hope brewed in Agatha’s chest at the sight of it. It looked so peaceful.</p><p>She pushed out of her vehicle and felt that hope shatter at the sound of squealing, giggling children growing closer.</p><p>“Boys! You were meant to be napping!”</p><p>Agatha felt like the wind had been ripped from her lungs. Her body seized in anguish as she turned to find two young children making a mad dash toward their mother’s car.</p><p>Her throat closed, a tourniquet to her lungs.</p><p>There was a young woman sprinting out behind them, her eyes wide with concern as she tried to convince them they should go back inside. Agatha vaguely heard her apologize to Wanda but the sounds of their conversation wavered in and out.</p><p>The boys were spitting images of Wanda and Vision; heart-shaped faces, arched brows, and fair skin. They had Vision’s jaw, his straight nose. Even from where Agatha watched she could see brilliant blue-green eyes filled with glee. Their floppy, red-blonde hair bounced with every step.</p><p>Both of them threw themselves at their mother, their arms outstretched before they were even close.</p><p>Agatha pressed a hand against her car and tried to ignore the empty eyes of her own son strobing inside of her mind. It was still so fresh even after years and Agatha worried she might be sick on Maximoff’s driveway.</p><p>This had been a terrible idea. She could live with carpet in her kitchen or gold granite if it meant she wouldn’t have to feel Nicky’s absence like an infected sore every time she saw one of Wanda’s kids so painfully alive.</p><p>Agatha weakly tried to grab at the door handle, incapable of taking her gaze off of the two boys. Wanda was kneeling down, speaking to them quietly.</p><p>Agatha’s hand finally found purchase on her car door just as the young faces turned, innocent, perfect eyes landing on Agatha.</p><p>She froze. Spots filled her vision and she realized she had not breathed from the first sound of their shouts.</p><p>Agatha tried to suck in oxygen but nothing happened and she resigned herself to passing out. It seemed like the quickest, least painful escape she could find from this situation.</p><p>One of the boys began walking toward her.</p><p>He left his brother, his small legs carrying him to stand directly in front of her. He had on khaki pants and a sweater to match his dad. Tiny sneakers were strapped to his feet by velcro. He looked like he was sizing her up, like he had the knowledge to decide her worth.</p><p>He held out the smallest hand and offered her a toothy smile.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>It looked like a practiced routine, his shoulders back like he was doing something very important.</p><p>And while Agatha was certain she’d lose consciousness in the next several seconds, she reached her hand out and encompassed the boy’s.</p><p>A stream of air seeped into Agatha’s lungs and she found herself able to breathe again. She shook the boy’s hand twice and hoped he hadn’t developed empathy enough to hear the waver in her voice.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>He held onto her hand, swinging it.</p><p>“I’m Billy.”</p><p>Agatha felt tears pooling in the corners of her eyes and the last thing she wanted was to terrify the kid by shattering in front of him</p><p>“Hi Billy. I’m Agatha.”</p><p>She watched her name register, watched his eyes widen excitedly.</p><p>“Mom told us about you!”</p><p>Agatha saw the other boy wandering toward her now and she fought the urge to flee. Wanda was watching after them apprehensively like she was torn between calling them back and letting the chips fall.</p><p>Agatha collected herself by the time Tommy was standing shoulder to shoulder with Billy.</p><p>He waved once and stared, his little head tilting.</p><p>“You jumped off a roof to save mom?”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow because that was not an age-appropriate story. She wrapped her suffering with a bow and put it away, a playful smile taking over her face.</p><p>“Which time?”</p><p>Two pairs of eyes lit up and they inched closer. Tommy was bouncing on his toes now, his cheeks turning red with the cold.</p><p>“Did you break any bones?”</p><p>Before Agatha was forced to find a way to tell that story without the really horrific plot line, Wanda intervened.</p><p>“Boys, let’s let Agatha get settled in. I’m sure you’ll be able to ask her all of your questions later.”</p><p>She walked up behind them and gently turned them away, mouthing a sincere “I’m sorry” to Agatha as she herded them back toward their nanny.</p><p>Agatha watched them walk away until Vision stepped in front of her.</p><p>The rather agreeable expression he wore most times had been replaced with stark understanding. His easy, near-goofy demeanor had sobered. Agatha was not a fan of this Vision. He was too observant, too present. She always preferred when his mind was off in the clouds solving complex equations or debating the moral theories.</p><p>This was why she didn’t want to come here. She had grown accustomed to not being seen.</p><p>Vision smiled; it held no pity but Agatha could see the knowing there. She waited for the blow, words that would finish the job started by the boys’ arrival.</p><p>Instead, Vision looked thoughtful.</p><p>“Agatha, do you still play chess?”</p><p>The whiplash from the question was enough to draw Agatha back to herself entirely.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Vision motioned toward the guesthouse.</p><p>“Chess. I thought we might play. Maybe after you’re fully settled in.”</p><p>Agatha stared. And blinked. Then she let out a tired laugh.</p><p>——————</p><p>They set all of her belongings inside and Vision walked her through the small space. The entryway was actually a small porch with enough room for a table and two chairs on the right and a porch swing on the left. The swing was painted terribly, clearly by less than dexterous hands and minds that didn’t understand color theory. Blue and red and yellow streaks and handprints covered the finely-sanded wood with no recognizable pattern.</p><p>Vision smiled as he caught her looking.</p><p>“They really wanted to be a part of the refurbishing.”</p><p>They stepped inside a large, rectangular room that seemed to be both a living and dining room. There was a large, yellow-topped table on the left with four ocean blue leather chairs sitting around it. To her right was a three-seater, pale orange couch and a television.</p><p>Ahead of her, through an open entryway, was the kitchen with wooden cabinets, white tile counters, and orange-red tile flooring. The appliances were new but matched well.</p><p>Most of the aesthetic was very 80’s and very bright, the pops of color so frequent that they began to blend and feel natural.</p><p>Vision took her up a circular staircase to a single, small room. This space was quieter, the walls a classic white over the paneling. There was a massive rug with dark blues and burnt oranges covering most of the hardwood floor. The bed was a queen, the frame made of pale wood. The sheets and duvet were a cream color with a pair of pillows that matched the orange of the rug.</p><p>A small bookshelf sat in the corner by a desk and, right beside the largest window, there was a wooden rocking chair with blue cushions.</p><p>Vision smiled.</p><p>“Make yourself at home here, Agatha.”</p><p>She hadn’t said anything as he’d retreated down the steps. She looked around the room once more before following.</p><p>Se​​ñor Scratchy was set up with his enclosure and all of the containers of toys and hay and food were placed into a small closet near the steps.</p><p>Agatha looked around and couldn’t bring herself to hate the home. It was warm and inviting and smelled like cedar and eucalyptus.</p><p>Vision came to stand in front of her and Agatha saw the telltale signs of an impending conversation just a bit too late to stop it from happening.</p><p>“You know, J. William Worden created a task-based model for processing–”</p><p>She couldn’t do it.</p><p>“Vision.”</p><p>He stopped, startled out of what was surely to be a long and uplifting monologue.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>Agatha looked at him for several seconds, locating her memories from the years before she left. In every one, Vision was steadfast. She never saw him lose his temper or speak with malice. He was a square, sure, sometimes prone to pontificating, but his attempts to befriend her, to connect with her, they’d always been sincere. At this moment she was too tired, too drained to give him anything but honesty.</p><p>“I don’t need a lesson on loss. I need a nap and some extra strength Advil.”</p><p>To his credit, he rebounded incredibly fast.</p><p>“Of course! I’ll leave you to acclimate. The medicine cabinet in the bathroom is stocked.” He nodded one too many times and then seemed to gather himself. “Please don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything.”</p><p>She nodded and watched him leave. The moment the door closed, her shoulders drooped and her eyes closed. She felt like she hadn’t slept in days.</p><p>Agatha waited several minutes and then returned to her car, pulling Rio’s box into her arms and walking it to the house. She put it under her bed and dropped the comforter back down to cover the evidence.</p><p>Agatha didn’t plan to stay long. She had to get away before the constant reminders of Nicky’s short life killed her too.</p><p>Still, it wouldn’t do to let her best clothing wrinkle. She spent the next twenty minutes hanging her items in the small closet beside the desk. She’d just opened the last suitcase when her heart lurched into her throat. There, stuffed into the bottom, was Nicky’s quilt. Agatha’s next breath shook as she drew in.</p><p>After the revelation to Rio, Agatha had not been able to bring herself to unpack it. It had felt wrong to place it in the safehouse. The space was not a home, it wasn’t her own. She hadn’t planned to stay long. But now, in a parallel circumstance, she reconsidered. Her hand slid along the first block, a comic-style rendering of a little boy with shaggy brown hair and a small rabbit at his side. She smiled, eyes wet, and scratched lightly at the white fabric that made up Se​​ñor Scratchy’s body.</p><p>Nicholas had gotten to decide every inch of the quilt and he’d been adamant that all superheroes had sidekicks. The bunny was therefore given a mask and a cape and stitched permanently into the lore.</p><p>Rio had taken to making quiet comments, out of Nicky’s earshot, about the limitations to a rabbit sidekick: they ranged from practical to deeply obscure and Agatha had devolved into laughter despite her best efforts.</p><p>”What is a rabbit going to do, chew the shoelaces of their enemies?” “Is the rabbit sentient? Will it shit itself constantly as it’s saving the world?” During a particular description of a combat scene from Nicky, Rio had whispered. “One kick and it’s a goner.”</p><p>Agatha had turned away from Nicky’s focused expression and grinned, biting her cheek to force away her amusement. She’d shoved at Rio.</p><p>“Stop it.”</p><p>Rio shrugged.</p><p>“I’m just saying. I’m not gonna be scared of a bunny rabbit. Their bones are tiny.”</p><p>Agatha had pushed her palm over Rio’s face to try to stop her from speaking.</p><p>“Stop thinking about how you’d defeat Nicky’s sidekick in martial combat. That is not why we’re here.”</p><p>Rio had caught her hand, pulling her in close. She’d whispered very seriously into Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“One must always be prepared.” She’d nodded against Agatha’s shoulder. “I could curbstomp a rabbit.”</p><p>Agatha had wrapped her fingers into the hair at the base of Rio’s neck, her chest shaking with laughter.</p><p>“You’re insufferable.”</p><p>“As much or more than a rabbit sidekick would be?”</p><p>The comments had become a continuous, easy joke between the two of them. The more ridiculous the comment, the more Agatha had fallen into fits of laughter, the more Rio had made them a permanent part of her vocabulary.</p><p>Agatha carefully drew the quilt from the suitcase and laid it over the bedspread. Once she’d finished unpacking, she stood in the center of the room idly, eyes unseeing.</p><p>She felt– she wasn’t certain what she was feeling. The rollercoaster of emotions that she’d been on– so different from the apathy of her time away– had left her unmoored. When she left DC, she’d felt like she’d been washed up on a rocky shore. It had been barren and cold and Agatha had taken to it and clung to the numbness it gifted her.</p><p>Coming back was like deciding to finally swim for help.The waters were rough and flashed hot and cold. She didn’t know where land was or if anyone would find her before she was lost to the tides. It felt like she was drowning, choking on lungfuls of sea water, her legs kicking uselessly and her arms losing strength. Every time she went under, she opened irritated eyes to see the shape of Rio looming from the surface and the grave of Nicky calling her to the depths.</p><p>Agatha ran her hands over her face, pressing against the tender skin around her eyes. Maybe a nap would help. Something quick to black out her thoughts and feelings and jumpstart her for the rest of the day.<br/>_________</p><p>Agatha woke up overheated, her body smothered by comforter and quilt. She blinked, somehow the exhaustion from before having doubled, and she shoved blindly in an attempt to release herself. The sheets tangled around her legs and an irrational panic filled her until she was able to yank hearself out. She laid there and stared at the dark ceiling for several moments. She grabbed her phone from her nightstand to give herself something to focus on.</p><p>She had two texts, both from Wanda. The first was from two hours prior.</p><p>
<i>Vis is going to the store. Let me know what he can grab for you!</i>
</p><p>The next text was from ten minutes ago.</p><p>
<i>We left you a few bags on the porch! Just some basics to get you through the next couple of days.</i>
</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>She drew her rage like a comfort around her shoulders, pinning it in place and letting it simmer through the guilt and confusion and hurt. Dr. Alder had said that healing wasn’t going to be a steady path, that Agatha would falter from it from time to time even if she were trying her hardest. She never said Agatha couldn’t actively choose to side-step the path in order to give herself a respite.</p><p>Agatha stood, dazed, and made her way to the porch. She opened the door to three bags of basics sitting on top of an assortment of children’s lunchbox ice packs.</p><p>She scowled and closed the door; leaving the bags outside. She wasn’t here to be coddled and Wanda wasn’t going to win her over by ingratiating herself. Her show of kindness could rot.</p><p>Agatha walked around the kitchen, familiarizing herself with the location of the coffee mugs– just in case– and then made her wait to Senior Scratchy to let him out of his cage.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Agatha yanked open the door and dragged the bags inside. She quickly dispersed the items between the pantry and fridge and looked at the now-melted icepacks.</p><p>She considered returning them. It would be the polite thing to do.</p><p>Agatha stuffed the collection– soccer ball, smiley face, flower, baseball, heart– into her freezer and slammed the door.</p><p>She wandered to her porch the, opening the door to let the afternoon chill seep into the space. Agatha wrapped a scarf around her neck and stepped outside, carefully settling into the hand-painted swing. She lifted her legs, the gentle rock easing back her anxiety.</p><p>She left her phone to die on her bedside table and swayed until the fireflies started their mating dances and a pair of crickets sang to one another from opposing sides of the house.</p><p>_____________</p><p> </p><p>Sunday morning, Agatha woke up confused, the normally blazing sunlight nowhere to be found. She peeled her eyes open slowly and glanced around. She wasn’t sure what time it was, but her phone hadn’t gone off to drag her into the office and she was infinitely glad for it. She curled back into her sheets and let herself slip back to sleep.</p><p>She woke to a text from Wanda asking if she wanted to join them for lunch and she groaned loudly, ignoring her once more.</p><p>She needed to get out. She needed to breathe.</p><p>Agatha pulled on a pair of black joggers and one of her ratty, stained workout shirts that had seen its better days years prior. It was thread-bare and soft and had the name of their first volleyball team during Quantico written across the chest. Bohner Busters. They’d nearly been disqualified for the name alone but Ralph Bohner’s presence on the team had stilled the commissioner's hand. Ralph had griped against the name from the moment Agatha had submitted it for selection and his disdain for it only grew as every team he was on followed the naming convention.</p><p>She pulled on a gold-brown, waffled, half-zip sweatshirt and quickly made her way toward her car.</p><p>She was able to escape the property without any interruptions. Her plan was simply to drive until she didn’t feel the pressure of everyone’s suffocating expectations raking through her.</p><p>It went well for a solid ten minutes; her mind occupied with the decisions of where to turn and how far she could push the speed limit before it became questionable. She played music from her phone, letting the eclectic mix of her liked songs consume her thoughts.</p><p>Then she realized where her muscle memory was carrying her and she felt the relief break apart. She turned left instead of right, her decisions now colored by everything she was running from.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fell to a familiar sign and she turned before she was able to reconsider. She drove along the two-lane street until she reached the back entrance to the major trailheads that littered the C&amp;O. She parked next to the dozens of vehicles already littering the space and sat back in her seat.</p><p>Agatha looked at her tennis shoes and mild athletic wear; they would do. There were easier trails mixed in with the many arduous ones and she’d walked them enough to feel confident in her ability to make the correct turns.</p><p>_________</p><p>Agatha wheezed out a breath as she clambered up what felt like a cliff, her shoes slipping dramatically, sending pebbles down below her toward a person that had started climbing not long after her first step.</p><p>Her hand landed on a particularly sharp rock and she attempted to withdraw only for the motion to dislodge her stability. She slipped, hand catching on the same sharp rock as she halted her descent. She felt the tear of skin and immediately saw crimson slipping down the back of her hand to her wrist.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha took a steadying breath and continued to climb, her hand leaving smears of crimson along the rocks. “This is why hiking is and always will be fucking asinine. Fuck.”</p><p>Agatha rolled over the edge and lay on her back, her lungs heaving in and expelling air.</p><p>The person that came up behind her, a man in his thirties with tiny, blue shorts and two backpack straps around his shoulders, stood over her with a concerned expression.</p><p>“Are you alright, miss?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t open her eyes.</p><p>“Eat a bag of dicks.”</p><p>There was a stunned silence followed by a quick departure. Agatha laid in the sun, the cool breeze tickling the raw skin of her palm as she caught her breath.</p><p>“That was rude.”</p><p>Agatha’s blood went ice-cold, her lungs floundering. It was impossible. Nobody’s luck could be so terrible.</p><p>“You have got to be kidding me.”</p><p>She opened her eyes, peering up to see two silhouettes, one standing just-so to ensure that the full force of the sun still hit Agatha in the face. She saw one of the shadows crouch down, coming into stark clarity like an omen of the apocalypse.</p><p>Rio’s face came into view, her eyes covered by sunglasses and her hair loosely gathered in a mid-bun, her bangs framing her face.</p><p>“Hi Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha took in Rio’s practical pants and a color-blocked fleece pullover. She could see Rio’s hiking boots laced up to her ankles and she briefly considered untying them and making a run for it.</p><p>Instead, she dropped her head back down and covered her eyes with her arm. It was simply implausible that Rio was <i>here</i> on this specific trail at the exact same time.</p><p>“If you’re going to keep talking you might as well roll me off the cliff.”</p><p>Rio’s amused chuckle sounded far too close.</p><p>“You almost did that yourself just climbing up. Why aren’t you wearing boots? Why are you even on this trail? The one time I got you out here you complained for two straight hours and made me buy an uber to our car.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“How about we skip the part where we rehash old memories and you head on your way.”</p><p>Before Rio could retort, Agatha heard a bright, perky voice cry out in incredibly unnecessary concern.</p><p>“Oh god, your hand! Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha slowly withdrew her arm, her head turning to try and make out whomever was shrieking in her ear. She could vaguely make out tight, black leggings and a pair of light-blue hiking boots. Agatha rolled away from where Rio was crouched and pushed herself to her feet, ignoring the stab of pain that shot through her hand.</p><p>She blinked until she could take in the full picture before her.</p><p>Rio was here, yes. But she was here <i>with</i> somebody. A young, striking woman with long, blonde hair pulled back into two braids down her neck. She was wearing a white tank top under a sheer long-sleeved top that showed off her tits.</p><p>The woman was clearly waiting for an answer but Agatha was busy trying to process through the amalgamation of thoughts crashing into her skull. Rio was on a date? At the site of their second? Agatha felt a wave of violent nausea and chased it back with a scathing tone.</p><p>“I didn’t know you hiked with Doctor Barbie on the weekends.”</p><p>Rio gave her an unamused look and Agatha didn’t bother looking at how the dig had landed with the woman herself.</p><p>Rio held out a hand.</p><p>“This is Rebecca Wagner. She–”</p><p>Agatha held up a hand.</p><p>“I genuinely do not care.”</p><p>She looked around, attempting to remember which direction she’d need to take to return to her original trail.</p><p>Rio tilted her head but it was the blonde, <i>Rebecca</i>, who spoke. She smiled airily, her pale blue eyes squinting against the sun.</p><p>“You should walk with us. We have a first aid kit.”</p><p>It was a collective, a claim denoting ownership, and Agatha bristled.</p><p>“Oh, goodie. Maybe you can help me remove the splinter from my ass.”</p><p>Rebecca seemed reticent but she nodded slowly, voice questioning as she glanced between Rio’s exasperated expression and Agatha’s sharp tone.</p><p>“Okay. . . I can take a look.”</p><p>Agatha offered Rio a deadpan look before shaking her head and offering a tight, overly-sweet smile.</p><p>“This has been so enjoyable but I have to run.” She turned, her teeth clenched around the next words. “I hope you both drown.”</p><p>Agatha confidently chose to go left and she tried to disregard any of the roiling emotions that were zipping through her. Rio sure split from pattern with this one. Rebecca seemed dumber than a sack of rocks and had the personality of a soggy paper plate. Agatha rolled her shoulders to attempt to shrug off the discomfort when she heard footsteps approaching from behind.</p><p>She felt a touch to her shoulder and about launched the woman by her baby-pink manicured hand into the dirt.</p><p>Rebecca turned Agatha’s body towards her, eyes showing sternness about as well as a newborn kitten.</p><p>“I’m not letting you keep going without cleaning your hand. It could get infected!”</p><p>Agatha took in Rio’s amused face over Rebecca’s shoulder before responding.</p><p>“It’ll be fine, Reba.”</p><p>Rebecca’s brows furrowed then smoothed, an amused grin taking over her face.</p><p>“Oh! It’s actually Rebecca.”</p><p>Agatha allowed her eyes to go wide, her patience reaching its already tenuous limits.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>She turned on her heel and kept walking.</p><p>Rio called out behind her.</p><p>“Do you know where you’re going?”</p><p>Agatha kept moving.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>It was the way Rio said it. The knowing, smug undertone that had Agatha pulling to a stop. Just because she was proud did not mean she was willing to risk being stuck on this overlay of trails for the next four hours. Agatha faced Rio.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Rio looked unbothered at the bite there, her shoulders shrugging.</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>Agatha could see the glimmer of amusement dancing behind her dark eyes.</p><p>“Just–” Agatha cut herself off, wincing as she squeezed her bloodied fist too tightly. She leveled out her voice. “Let’s not do this, yeah? Just tell me which direction and I’ll be out of your hair.”</p><p>Rio was enjoying this too much.</p><p>“Sure, but I think you should let Rebecca bandage up your hand. She’s really concerned.”</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio, testing her resolve to play her game, and Rio looked back, deeply pleased.</p><p>If Rio were alone, if this wasn’t some incredibly uncomfortable third-wheel situation where she was forced to consider, not for the first time, that her ex-wife had been dating other people, Agatha would have bled out before giving in.</p><p>But here, her alternative was to let the pair hound her footsteps as she bumbled her way out of the forest.</p><p>Agatha grit her teeth to clamp down on her rage and shoved her hand in the direction of Rebecca.</p><p>“Hurry up.”</p><p>Rebecca appeared at her left and circled behind Rio, reaching easily for the backpack on her shoulders. She dug through it like Rio being her packmule was the norm and they’d done this a thousand times. Agatha’s mouth was acrid, her teeth aching with the pressure on them.</p><p>Her eyes didn’t leave Rio’s. She wasn’t going to give her the satisfaction of being the first to retreat.</p><p>Agatha’s body felt like a conveyor belt system as it carried the weighted surges of pain and insidious jealousy through her chest before it churned out into rage. With nowhere to go, Agatha felt the pressure of it building beneath her sternum and seeping into the muscles of her shoulders.</p><p>Rebecca popped from behind Rio with a broad smile. She wiggled the first aid kit in her hand.</p><p>“This will probably be easier if we’re not standing.”</p><p>Rio’s head tilted.</p><p>“Agreed.” She nodded toward the bench. “Sit down.”</p><p>It was said innocently, but Agatha could see the upturn at the corner of Rio’s mouth; a clear reminder of their moment in the office. But it rang wrong, a clang of disconnect in Agatha’s chest as she vaguely considered whether Rio had changed so much that she would be actively dating someone and still torment Agatha. She brushed aside the disparity of it because this was Rio and she refused to give her the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>When Agatha didn’t move, Rio’s head tilted and she offered a grin.</p><p>“Sit down, <i>please.</i>”</p><p>Agatha huffed, goosebumps flaring across her skin, and walked over to a bench that looked out over the river.</p><p>Rebecca followed her, her perky tits shoved in Agatha’s face as she sat beside her. Rebecca picked up Agatha’s hand and gave her a little pout.</p><p>“This looks so painful.”</p><p>She opened a water bottle and started to turn it over Agatha’s palm.</p><p>Just before it hit, Agatha yanked her hand back.</p><p>“Ow, be careful, man hands.”</p><p>The water ended up splashing across the ground and Rebecca’s cheeks blazed.</p><p>“Sorry!”</p><p>Agatha wanted to gut punch her. She clocked Rio’s knowing stare and offered a look in return. <i>Her? Really?</i></p><p>Rebecca set to work again, turning the water bottle slower like somehow the action of it had caused Agatha pain before. The cool liquid splashed across the drying wound in the middle of Agatha’s hand, catching on the flakes of blood and loose skin. It did sting but Agatha kept it to herself.</p><p>Rebecca washed the blood from her wrist and palm far more efficiently than Agatha expected. The movements were practiced, concise, and she tried to piece together who the hell was sitting next to her.</p><p>Rebecca smiled at her brightly.</p><p>“You have such soft skin.”</p><p>Agatha looked to Rio, intent on passing judgment, but she found her ex-wife watching Rebecca as she worked. It made her stomach roil.</p><p>Rebecca placed Agatha’s hand on her leg and started opening a few antiseptic wipes.</p><p>“This will sting a bit.”</p><p>Agatha did hiss this time, her palm flexing at the burn.</p><p>To her utter shock, Rebecca lifted her hand and blew gently on the wound. Agatha stared at her and Rebecca’s eyes turned up with a sincere smile.</p><p>“It works on the kids.”</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks burn with a myriad of embarrassment– though she wasn’t sure what for– and confusion. Her anger stuttered, stopped, then reignited as she processed through the feelings. Maybe the woman was a fucking idiot but there was something there, Agatha could see the draw.</p><p>She sat still, eyes averted, as Rebecca pasted a topical antibiotic into the wound, pressed gauze against it, and then wrapped it expertly with medical tape. Agatha felt a soft squeeze on her hand and drew it away instantly, standing and putting distance between herself and the blonde.</p><p>“Great, so appreciated. Where the hell am I going?”</p><p>Rio’s expression turned from pensive back to her prior glee. She tilted her head toward the same direction Agatha had already been walking with a stupid little smirk pulling at her lips.</p><p>Agatha curled her hands into fists, ignoring the dull pain as she curbed her desire to scream.</p><p>“I loathe you.”</p><p>She stalked off and felt certain her fury was visible in the form of steam sizzling off her overheated skin. She had only made it ten feet before she heard boots on gravel behind her.</p><p>Rebecca’s perky voice felt like screeching as she jogged up to Agatha.</p><p>“We’re going this way too!”</p><p>Agatha tried to remember if there was any portion of the trail where they’d be close enough to the river for her to accidentally push the woman in.</p><p>“Fantastic.”</p><p>The abrasive edge in her voice carried right over Rebecca’s head and Agatha reconsidered the words she’d spoken to Lilia. She’d said karma would have her dead, but now she wondered if this might be worse.</p><p>She ignored the pair at her side and back for the better part of ten minutes as they carved between large boulders and pretty shrubbery. The sounds of the river below felt like they should be cleansing. The trails in Potomac were like the paintings people hung in their homes; idyllic and near-unbelievably beautiful. Agatha couldn’t enjoy any of it as Rebecca droned on and on about the mountains she’d climbed and which were her favorite.</p><p>They passed several other hikers, some alone, others in groups. She didn’t respond to their friendly greetings but Rebecca seemed to think it a responsibility. She made comments and offered compliments, earning warm, pleased smiles and bursts of conversation.</p><p>It reminded Agatha of her time undercover when Wanda had been playing the part of a drug mule. She’d been subjected to hours of vapid, high-pitched conversations from the surveillance van as Wanda worked her way up toward their target. Agatha had complained to Rio about for the month-long span Wanda was ‘Chastity,’ so much so that they’d taken to calling Wanda her undercover name whenever her voice reached a certain octave. Wanda had taken it in stride.</p><p>Now, without a bigger purpose or target, the voice grated Agatha’s eardrums to shreds.</p><p>As they reached a fork half-a-mile later, the right leading toward a valley and the left back toward the river, Agatha slowed.</p><p>Rio drew to a halt, standing beside Agatha for the first time. She’d been allowing Agatha to take the brunt of her date’s attention for the better part of thirty minutes.<br/>“Which way are you thinking?”</p><p>Agatha wanted to strangle her with her bare hands. The only thing that stayed the action was her certainty that Rio would enjoy it too much.</p><p>She had two options. Three if murder was on the table. She could guess and start walking in the hopes that she wasn’t wrong or she could play whatever game Rio had decided to waste her time with. One of them ended this much faster.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Rio feigned surprise but it looked far too much like gloating. When Agatha’s expression didn’t veer away from fury, Rio looked to Rebecca.</p><p>“I think we should play twenty questions.”</p><p>Rebecca looked thrilled.</p><p>Agatha glanced between them, face twisted in distaste. What kind of fucked-up foreplay was twenty questions and why was she being forced participate?</p><p>Rio smiled.</p><p>“I’ll go first.” She started down the path to the right. “Why are you out here without any gear? You don’t even have water.”</p><p>Agatha tried to decide if she should bite the bullet or eat one.</p><p>“I clearly wasn’t planning on being on this trail.”</p><p>“It looks like you weren’t planning on hiking at all.”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“Thanks for that incredible insight.”</p><p>The path under their feet began to turn to jagged stones and sloping boulders and Agatha slowed. She took her time maneuvering her sneakers into the proper places to avoid breaking her ankles.</p><p>Both Rio and Rebecca eased ahead, their boots gripping the rocks and keeping their ankles stable. Rio moved with purpose but remained light on her feet, graceful in her steps. Rebecca looked like she was simply floating over the uneven surface.</p><p>Rebecca turned back, eyes laced with concern.</p><p>“Do you want to hold onto me?”</p><p>Agatha nearly bit through her tongue as her sneaker slipped. She offered Rebecca a faux-hopeful look while walking through her offered arm.</p><p>“Are you a valued family heirloom?” She continued at Rebecca’s confusion. “A pack of cigarettes?” Agatha placed her foot gingerly. “Maybe a bottle of absinthe to pour into my ears?”</p><p>Rebecca stuttered, trying to find the right question to ask.</p><p>“I don’t— what?”</p><p>Agatha’s amusement vanished as she nearly bashed her skull in. Her tennis shoe slid into a particularly deep crack and she yelped as she began to fall.</p><p>Rio’s arm wrapped around her stomach, tugging her upright.</p><p>Agatha could feel the shape of Rio against her back, the earthy familiar scent of her, her cologne, the sweat on her jaw and arms and throat.</p><p>She extricated herself quickly, shoving Rio’s arm away as she marched onward. She twisted her ankles four times as she beelined for the stable ground several yards away.</p><p>She was nearly panting as her feet found stable ground.</p><p>Rio joined her a moment later, voice mocking.</p><p>“Try not to overreact, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha ran her hands over her sweatshirt and continued on.</p><p>Silence fell, minutes passed, and Agatha thought she may have escaped the adolescent game. She could hear a quiet conversation happening behind her and she ground her teeth together as Rebecca giggled at something Rio said.</p><p>Agatha studied the wilderness on either side of her, judging her ability to survive off-path. She could just start jogging, but there was something that shriveled inside of her at the idea of literally running away from the situation.</p><p>There was a person coming her direction from below, a woman in her early twenties, and Agatha made no effort to create space as she passed. The woman’s shoulder slammed into hers and Agatha feigned outrage.</p><p>“Etiquette doesn’t matter as much as it used to.”</p><p>The woman had stumbled, throwing Agatha a shocked glare, before moving forward carefully around Rio and Rebecca.</p><p>Rebecca looked hesitant before she spoke and Agatha counted that as a win.</p><p>“Anyone coming uphill has the right of way.”</p><p>Agatha mouthed the words mockingly to herself before turning back. Her expression was one of sickly-sweet apology.</p><p>“You are so right.” She shook her head. “Silly me.”</p><p>Rebecca, for the first time, didn’t seem to completely buy into the act. She glanced over toward Rio and Agatha did the same, brows lifting in challenge.</p><p>Rio had been too quiet for the duration, her small comments meant to poke and prod and cause Agatha discomfort. Now, she met Agatha’s challenge with her own, eyes knowing.</p><p>“She’s just masking her discomfort.”</p><p>Rebecca didn’t seem to notice the stare-off happening in front of her, nor the ratcheting tension.</p><p>“Oh, I totally understand. When I’m out of my element I definitely talk way too much.”</p><p>Agatha let her eye roll to Rebecca.</p><p>“Only then, huh?”</p><p>She turned around and started walking. Agatha felt like she’d come out on top of the situation, pride sitting tall on her shoulders. She began to maneuver down a steep ravine, taking three steps before the soles of her shoes skidded against the loose dirt. She slid several paces but kept her balance.</p><p>She didn’t let it humble her, her chin up even as she slid and stumbled her way down. As they reached the bottom, Rebecca seemed keen to release her awkwardness.</p><p>“So. Twenty questions, right? I’ll go.” She caught up to Agatha and let out a chuckle. “I already know so much about Rio so I’ll ask you.”</p><p>The statement gutted Agatha, scraping at her organs with jagged talons. She waved out a hand.</p><p>“Pass.”</p><p>Rebecca sighed and turned her attention to Rio.</p><p>“Fine. Rio, how do you two know each other?”</p><p>Agatha’s skin prickled. She spoke at the same time as Rio.</p><p>“I’m her electrician.”</p><p>“She’s on Wanda’s new team.”</p><p>That caused an uncomfortable twist in Agatha’s stomach. This woman knew about Wanda? She knew about Rio’s job? How long had this been going on? How did she not know about <i>her?</i></p><p>A sickly series of images played through Agatha’s skull and she sped up her pace.</p><p>Rebecca let out a confused laugh.</p><p>“So you’re an electrician? On Wanda’s team?”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Silence fell over the group and Agatha could tell her steps were more forceful, her posture rigid and tight.</p><p>Rebecca piped up again.</p><p>“Your turn, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha slowed. She could not do this. She was about to stuff a handful of dirt down the throat of Rio’s new pet.</p><p>“How about this:” She turned expectant eyes to Rio. “You tell me how to get back to my car and I will leave you two to play your cute little date-game.”</p><p>Rebecca looked startled.</p><p>“Oh, that’s—“</p><p>Agatha snapped.</p><p>“Can it, cabbage patch.” She turned expectant eyes on Rio. “Just tell me where to go.”</p><p>Rio studied her, eyes curious, surprised. She shot Rebecca an apologetic smile.</p><p>“Excuse us for a minute.”</p><p>Rebecca had crossed her arms, the action somehow making her tits even more prominent. She nodded and walked ahead a few feet.</p><p>Rio refocused on Agatha, eyes searching, smug.</p><p>“Jealousy looks good on you.”</p><p>Agatha seethed.</p><p>“Try embarrassed. Does she have a brain in there or were the tits enough to catch your attention?” Agatha’s eyes shot toward Rebecca and she scowled. “She has to be cold. What’s the point of wearing a shirt if it doesn’t cover a single part of your body?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, lips turning up further.</p><p>“Agatha, Rebecca is my assistant.”</p><p>Agatha’s stream of vitriolic comments stemmed to a halt, her lips parting, closing as nothing came out. Every bit of rage that had collected seemed to fizzle out and die. She looked away.</p><p>“Classic work affair. Are you going to tell me where I need to go?”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, expression and tone dangerously low.</p><p>“Do you think I would talk to you like I did in my office if I had taken up with my assistant?”</p><p>Agatha drew in an unsteady breath and started to turn.</p><p>“This has been an absolute pleasure but I’m—“</p><p>Rio caught her arm as Agatha tried to pass her. Her fingers were rough, pressing into the muscle of Agatha’s arm.</p><p>“Answer me.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a weak wisp of air, the pressure of Rio’s fingers pulsing through her nerves to her core. She tilted her head toward their path companion that was very obviously trying not to watch.</p><p>“Unless you’re planning to fuck me in front of your assistant, I think you’d better let go.”</p><p>Rio’s tongue rolled over her teeth, her heavy expression lifting to heated amusement.</p><p>“Exhibitionist.”</p><p>Agatha smirked.</p><p>“Coward.”</p><p>Rio’s grip loosened but did drop, her features softening.</p><p>“Are you parked on McArthur?”</p><p>Agatha relaxed a little, nodded.</p><p>Rio slowly released her, fingers trailing to her elbow before withdrawing.</p><p>“There’s a split ahead. You can take the left path and it’ll get you on the right trail.”</p><p>Agatha straightened her sleeve and stepped back.</p><p>“It’s weird to hang out with your assistant.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>“We’ll see you at work, Agatha.”</p><p>She returned to Rebecca’s side and continued down the path.</p><p>Rebecca turned back, offered Agatha a hesitant wave, then followed.</p><p>Her voice carried back to Agatha as they disappeared around a bend.</p><p>“She’s kind of hot in a scary way...”</p><p>Rio’s responding groan was enough to put Agatha in a better mood even through the hour-long trek it took to reach her car.</p><p>She was covered in a fine layer of dirt and her shoes were filthy. She sat down and slumped into the driver’s seat, a tired laugh leaving her throat.</p><p>Agatha looked back toward the trail entrance, made a face, and flipped the bird at the entire concept of hiking before driving away.</p>

<p>“Intern!”</p><p>The boy sitting at his desk, eyes glued to the screen, jumped about two feet from his chair and spilled a portion of his coffee across the papers in front of him.</p><p>With panicked eyes, he dabbed at the mess with his sleeve.</p><p>Agatha walked to the filing cabinet behind her desk and lifted a brand new plant for his viewing.</p><p>He had the intelligence to at least feign guilt as he continued to ruin his shirt.</p><p>“It was on sale.”</p><p>Agatha shoved it toward him.</p><p>“Great. You have a nice side table there to keep it.”</p><p>The intern grimaced and made no move to take the pot from her.</p><p>“But your side is kind of a huge bummer.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and was ready to snipe back when Wanda called them to the war room.</p><p>The intern moved first, fiddling with the wet arm of his sleeve, lips pulled back in distaste. He seemed relieved by the interruption and avoided eye contact with Agatha as he slipped out.</p><p>Agatha put the Ivy down and followed.</p><p>Wanda had pulled up the kidnapping case in Greece, the evidence displayed on the screens.</p><p>Agatha took a seat beside the intern as the others gathered around them.</p><p>Wanda nodded toward Agatha.</p><p>“William and Agatha have been working the case to the extent possible while stateside. The local police have questioned all identified attendees that engaged with the victim and suspect except one.” She flicked the screen to an image of a man with a large belly and a full, brown beard. “Ramus Bauer. He was visiting from Germany, and had been there for approximately a week and a half. He flew out the day after and we haven’t been able to locate him.”</p><p>Wanda moved to the next image, this one of the suspect and victim exiting the club.</p><p>“There has been no ransom request despite the prominence of the victim. It is looking like a trafficking case and the local law enforcement doesn’t have the resources to extend this investigation further.”</p><p>Lilia frowned.</p><p>“What about the family? Have they been spoken to?”</p><p>Wanda looked to Agatha and Agatha took the cue. She stood, hands spreading over the table.</p><p>“The Hartwells have been less than forthcoming.” She flipped through to a picture of the parents. “Arthur and Mazie Hartwell. The wife is a lush and completely under her husband’s thumb. Arthur is a crackhead. Metaphorically.” She tilted her head. “Maybe literally. He is convinced that this is a ploy by the US government to gain access to his Advanced AI.”</p><p>Alice scoffed.</p><p>“He’s willing to risk his daughter’s life on that theory?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“So far, yes. Our inquiries and requests have all been denied by his horde of lawyers. I think we should go knocking, but–”</p><p>Sharon squawked.</p><p>“Now, now, without a warrant–”</p><p>Agatha held out a hand.</p><p>“We get it, Sharon.” She switched to the posts pulled from Georgie Hartwell’s Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter accounts. “The intern poured through her posts and found a few that could have connections to her disappearance.”</p><p>When she looked at the intern to pick it up from there, he seemed surprised. Then excited. He slid the remote to himself and clicked.</p><p>“It wouldn’t have been hard for somebody to locate her. She posted everything with her location and it was clear she was traveling alone. There were dozens of messages from her massive following but these four drew my attention.” He pulled up a short message that read <i>It’s dangerous to travel alone so far from home!</i> “I thought at first it might have just been a concerned fan. There are a few others with similar messages. But if you look at the history here, the user has no identifying information and only started following Georgie within the past month. Yet they’ve sent twelve messages showing concern for her safety.”</p><p>He showed the other three messages. Two of them seemed like a stretch, their profiles public and incredibly widespread. But their messages were detailed and inappropriate enough to warrant concern.</p><p>The last message was from an account with no picture and no posts. It read <i>It was so nice to meet you tonight, Georgina.</i></p><p>The intern frowned.</p><p>“I was able to trace the middle two accounts to IP addresses in California. They are mildly connected to Georgie and are likely uninvolved. These other two have led me to dead ends so far.”</p><p>Jen flicked through the documents provided on the tablet in front of her.</p><p>“Are there any connections to the local gangs? The government has been working to combat trafficking there but they’re still a significant hub.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“They say there’s no connection to any of the usual suspects. It’s hard to know if they’re lying from five thousand miles away.”</p><p>Wanda nodded.</p><p>“Exactly, which is why you’ll be taking a trip to Athens.”</p><p>That was news to Agatha. She watched as the rest of the team took in the information, trying to figure out her own feelings about it.</p><p>Jen tilted her head, weighing the statement.</p><p>“There are definitely worse places to go.”</p><p>Lilia frowned.</p><p>“How quick is the turnaround?”</p><p>Wanda leaned back in her chair, eyes looking over the group.</p><p>“Tomorrow morning. Six.”</p><p>Agatha groaned loudly.</p><p>The intern leaned forward in his excitement.</p><p>“So, like, does this mean I can go?”</p><p>Wanda considered it, eyes narrowing.</p><p>Sharon shook her head.</p><p>“It’s far too dangerous. He’s not technically protected by the Legal Attache Program.”</p><p>Agatha waved her hand.</p><p>“Get him temporary immunity.”</p><p>Sharon looked appalled. She mimicked Agtha’s wave, her tone becoming painful.</p><p>“Temporary immunity! Just throw together temporary immunity in fifteen hours. Of course!”</p><p>Wanda placed a hand on Sharon’s shoulder, her smile placating.</p><p>“If he stays within the Embassy he should be safe, right?”</p><p>Sharon heaved in a breath, calming herself.</p><p>“It’s an option.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced, her eyes rolling as she stood from her chair.</p><p>“If he breaks any local laws we just let him rot in jail.” She looked to the intern. “Work for you?”</p><p>He looked at her with wide eyes, hesitant.</p><p>“Yes? Maybe. I don’t want to go to Greek prison.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, voice drenched in condescension.</p><p>“Then don’t do anything illegal.”</p><p>Alice caught the intern’s attention.</p><p>“We can go over the biggest no-nos on the jet. Sound good?”</p><p>Agatha clapped her hands.</p><p>“Great. It’s settled!” She looked to Sharon. “Your help is, as always, so incredibly pertinent. Such a delight.”</p><p>Agatha walked back to her office to the huffing and puffing from Sharon and Wanda’s consoling words.</p><p>The intern followed her a few minutes later. He stood awkwardly by her desk, rocking back on his heels.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“For what?”</p><p>He waved back at the war room vaguely.</p><p>“Making sure I could come along.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, eyes glued to her screen.</p><p>“I don’t care if you do or don’t. I just didn’t want to hear the whining.”</p><p>The intern rolled his eyes, a pleased smile on his face.</p><p>“Nah. You like me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fell to him, appalled. She pointed at his desk.</p><p>“Go away.” Her tone did nothing to remove his grin as he headed back to his chair. She called after him. “And stop buying plants!”</p><p>____________</p><p>Agatha arrived back at Wanda’s around seven, the sky already dark. The leaves had all but fallen from the trees, their cold, empty branches standing out against the gray sky.</p><p>She’d stayed late delving into the Hartwell financial records they were able to access. Georgina’s last transaction was at the club just before she was spotted on the CCTV. At least it was up until four hours ago when the card was used to make a purchase at a hotel on Crete. There were no cameras on site and the police had found no trace of the victim or suspect.</p><p>Agatha had scoured the rest of Georgina’s records to find any connection to the hotel or businesses in the area. Nothing.</p><p>The only other person in the office when she departed was Alice.</p><p>The woman was in the war room with dossiers on the known trafficking networks active in Greece and the surrounding countries. She looked up as Agatha approached.</p><p>“Anything good?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“Police found nothing at the hotel. The victim had no other transactions anywhere close to the hotel.” Agatha tilted her head toward the files on the table. “You?”</p><p>Alice pushed a file toward her.</p><p>“Bulgarian Networks have been incredibly active for the past six months. They’ve also claimed two prior high-profile abductions.”</p><p>Agatha flipped through the first two pages. They were both women in their very early twenties; one deceased, one still missing. Agatha pushed to the next page and quickly looked away. She cleared her throat.</p><p>Alice glanced at the first page of many with images of suspected or known victims. So many were children. She carefully closed the document in front of Agatha and slid it away, eyes on Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha straightened, throat tight.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Alice frowned, shrugged.</p><p>“Just trying to piece together the woman in front of me with the stories my mom told.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed out a laugh.</p><p>“I’m sure she had wonderful insights.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her sincerity cutting through Agatha’s deflection.</p><p>“She said she met you at the start of your career; that you were like a storm.”</p><p>For the first time in Agatha’s recent memory, she kept her mouth shut. She needed to know, to hear about the woman she used to be.</p><p>Alice smiled distantly.</p><p>“She said you were disharmonious; that your spirit was unyielding, intelligent,” Alice chuckled. “Dangerous. And kind. Too willful. Too curious. She said it could destroy you.”</p><p>The words felt like a brand, steaming and searing into her heart. Agatha tried to smile, to mask the impact, but it crumbled and left her bare. She looked away.</p><p>“It did.” Agatha slid her teeth together. “Tell her she was right next time you visit her grave.”</p><p>She wanted the words to cut, wanted a way out.</p><p>Alice just watched her.</p><p>“But she wasn’t. You’re still here.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks warmed, her heart swollen in her chest. She shook her head.</p><p>“No. No, that woman was swallowed by the storm.”</p><p>Alice had said nothing and Agatha had left.</p><p>Now, sitting in her car, she stared blankly at the darkening sky, seeing nothing. It took her several moments to gather the energy to open the door. As her feet hit the ground, she heard the sound of grass being pressed, crushed.</p><p>Her eyes fell on Billy; he had on a small, denim jacket and a bright red t-shirt. His head was covered by a too-large beanie and his jeans were tucked into red, rubber boots.</p><p>She stared at him. He stared back. Then he smiled.</p><p>It was like a sunrise.</p><p>Agatha desperately needed the night.</p><p>“Aren’t you too small to be outside alone?”</p><p>Billy giggled.</p><p>“No! I’m actually big.”</p><p>His mouth didn’t form properly around the words, the edges of the L’s rounded into W’s.</p><p>Agatha scowled.</p><p>“You’re small enough to be snatched by a bird.”</p><p>Billy laughed, his breath fogging in the cold air.</p><p>“That’s silly, Agatha. Mom said you were really funny.”</p><p>He mangled her name; said it with two F’s. She breathed through the tightness in her throat.</p><p>“I’m a real delight.” She shooed him toward his house. “Your parents are definitely looking for you. Time to go.”</p><p>Billy shrugged and walked toward her.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>There was no warning before he stuck his little hand in her own and began to pull her toward the house. She stumbled over her own feet, trying to decide if it was too dramatic to cling to the handle of her trunk.</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded in her ears. She felt like she was being dragged by a ghost, near certain at any moment the small hand would disappear from hers.</p><p>It took her until they’d reached the brick path to draw to a halt. She pulled her hand away</p><p>“Off you go.”</p><p>Billy pouted.</p><p>“I wanted to show you my new Legos. It’s a Spider-Man set.”</p><p>Agatha started to back away.</p><p>“I have to feed Señor Scratchy.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes lit up, sparkling blue under the yard lanterns.</p><p>“Your bunny!” He bounded toward her, erasing all of her efforts to escape. “Can I come see him? Please!”</p><p>His excitement was crushing.</p><p>Agatha felt like she’d been cornered by a wild animal instead of a four year old boy that seemed certain they were already friends.</p><p>“No.” His face fell, eyes watering slightly, and Agatha panicked. “You can take care of him. While I’m gone.”</p><p>Billy rebounded with shocking ease.</p><p>“Really!?” He frowned. “Where are you going? Can I put him in my room?” His eyes grew alarmed. “Do you think he’ll like me?”</p><p>Agatha had never been more grateful to hear Wanda’s voice.</p><p>“Billy?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked toward the patio doors backlit by the warm lights from within. Wanda looked concerned as she looked around the yard, then she landed on the pair of them.</p><p>Billy pointed excitedly at Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha said I could watch her bunny.”</p><p>Wanda’s widened in surprise but she masked quickly.</p><p>“Wow, that’s very exciting, baby. I’ll make sure your dad gets the instructions and you can do it together.” She half-turned to the door. “Come inside, your brother has been looking for you.”</p><p>Billy nodded, took a step, then looked at Agatha.</p><p>“I’ll be really careful.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat swelled.</p><p>“He’ll like that.”</p><p>Billy sprinted inside and Wanda looked torn between following and trying to speak to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha waved her off.</p><p>“I need to pack. I’ll see you in the morning, Maximoff.”</p><p>____________</p><p>Agatha had finished an entire bottle of wine by herself sitting on the porch swing, only going inside at the threat of mild frostbite.</p><p>When her alarm blared at four-thirty the next morning, Agatha had regrets.</p><p>She rolled out of bed, freezing, and tried not to puke in the beside trashcan. Agatha drank three glasses of water and downed Advil before she stuffed her legs into corduroy, gray-green pants, hissing at the cold of the fabric on her skin. She tugged a simple, black sweater over her head and slid her arms into a black topcoat.</p><p>Her packing the night before had consisted of stuffing three pairs of pants, five shirts, and two sweaters into a suitcase with her necessities. She brushed her teeth, bagged her toothbrush, and stuffed it into the pocket with the rest of her hygiene products.</p><p>Agatha nearly dropped her suitcase down the round steps as she felt a wave of sickness crash through her. She clenched her teeth and maneuvered herself down the steps.</p><p>She’d just reached the landing when there was a knock at her door.</p><p>Agatha yanked her sunglasses from the coffee table and shoved them over her eyes. She flung the door open to Wanda looking perfectly put together despite the fact that it was still dark outside.</p><p>“I wanted to offer you a ride.”</p><p>If there had been a logical reason to say no, Agatha would have. Her normal stubbornness was lost somewhere in her hangover and she didn’t want to undermine any argument she could come up with by puking in the middle of it.</p><p>“Whatever, let’s go.”</p><p>Wanda stepped back as Agatha rolled outside, nearly barreling her over.</p><p>Agatha walked to Wanda’s already running car that she’d pulled around the house and flung her suitcase on top of Wanda’s in the trunk.</p><p>As soon as she’d closed herself inside, she pressed her now-overheated forehead against the chilled glass.</p><p>Wanda climbed in beside her, holding out an unidentified object in a napkin.</p><p>“Vision made scones.”</p><p>Agatha nearly flinched away.</p><p>“I know I’ve been a bitch but attempted murder is a new low.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes.</p><p>“He’s really improved! I promise. It’s been ten years!”</p><p>Agatha carefully took the napkin and revealed the scone. It didn’t look horrendous. Then again, neither had the one that almost put Agatha in the grave.</p><p>...</p><p>
<i>Wanda held out the tray of scones with a look on her face like she was being held hostage. She whispered to Rio and Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Just please try them? He is so hyper focused on perfecting baking that we haven’t had sex in a week and a half.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio let out a severe sound.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s unacceptable. Have you already drafted the divorce papers?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha positioned Rio between herself and the scones, hands on her wife’s hips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Wanda, this is coercion. We have to risk food poisoning or be subjected to hearing about your sex life?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio laughed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda shot her a glare.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Exactly.” She held one out and shoved it past Rio’s head toward Agatha’s face. “Eat it, Harkness. Or I’m telling Rio what you pulled in New York last month.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha snatched the scone and backed away as Rio whirled around, a dangerous look in her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What happened in New York, Agatha?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha kicked out lazily as Rio approached, shooting a betrayed look to Wanda. She stuffed half the pastry in her mouth to keep from talking and began to chew.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Pure flour collapsed out of a pocket in the poorly mixed bread, coating her throat and teeth and gums in a sticky glue.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She coughed, spewing white powder across Rio’s chest, and then proceeded to choke for the better part of five minutes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vision ran into the room at the following cacophony of Agatha dying and Rio and Wanda sobbing with laughter.</i>
</p><p>
<i>His hopeful look melted into alarm and he passed her his glass of wine.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m so sorry, Agatha. Oh dear!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He patted her roughly on the back and Agatha downed the wine.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She wiped the tears in her eyes and heaved in lungfuls of air, throat burning.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re all dead to me.”</i>
</p><p>...</p><p>Agatha took a small bite of the scone. If she got waylaid by flour she would definitely be ruining the floor mat in Wanda’s car.</p><p>It was amazing.</p><p>“It’s passable.”</p><p>Wanda smirked like she knew Agatha was lying and Agatha did not prove her wrong when she ate the rest of the scone.</p><p>“Vision will be so happy to be redeemed.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. The warmth of every memory was tainted and dwelling in any too long would tatter them further.</p><p>They rode in silence to the airport. After a series of turns, any relief Agatha had felt churned away. She curled over her stomach as subtly as possible and took long, deep breaths.</p><p>Wanda noticed anyway.</p><p>“Are you hungover?”</p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p>“I’m car sick from your driving.”</p><p>“Right. Notwithstanding my perfect score in our driving test.”</p><p>Agatha rolled down the window and stuck her head out.</p><p>___________</p><p>Jennifer was already present and overdressed. She had a coffee in her hand and a suitcase at her feet.</p><p>Wanda parked and Agatha forced herself out of the vehicle.</p><p>Jen raised a brow.</p><p>“You look like shit.”</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>“At least for me it’s a rare occurrence.”</p><p>Wanda leaned around the back of the car as she pulled out their suitcases.</p><p>“Play nice.”</p><p>Agatha pointed lazily.</p><p>“She started it.”</p><p>Jennifer had the grace to nod.</p><p>“That’s true.”</p><p>Alice pulled in beside them, Lilia in the front seat and the intern leaning between them from the back.</p><p>He waved at Agatha and she grimaced.</p><p>“I’m getting on the jet.”</p><p>___________</p><p>They’d been in the air for an hour, Agatha having claimed a seat in the center so she could sleep on the table between the cushioned, leather seats. The intern had sat across from her but hadn’t said anything more than a quick “hello” to which she had grunted in response.</p><p>She was beginning to feel marginally better and she finally sat up, eyes blinking tiredly behind her sunglasses.</p><p>The intern was speaking across the row to Alice, their conversation revolving around a video game Agatha had never heard of.</p><p>Lilia was seemingly asleep across from Alice, her mouth slightly open as she snored.</p><p>Jen and Wanda had taken the two remaining seats behind Alice and the intern and were both looking out the windows of the plane.</p><p>The intern saw she had awoken and adjusted himself in his seat to face her.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha dropped her head against the headrest.</p><p>“Just dandy.”</p><p>Alice chuckled.</p><p>“Drinking before an eleven hour flight is a bold move, Harkness.”</p><p>The intern leaned forward.</p><p>“Were you at a party?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twisted in disgust.</p><p>“I’m over forty. You think I waste my time partying?”</p><p>The intern shrugged.</p><p>“Parties are fun.”</p><p>Alice nodded.</p><p>“I still party.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You're in your late twenties at best.”</p><p>Alice lifted her water bottle like a champagne glass.</p><p>“Thirty-two.”</p><p>Lilia was no longer sleeping, apparently, as her eyes pried open and she interjected.</p><p>“I’m fifty-five and I can still let loose every now and then.”</p><p>Agatha waved dismissively and Wanda chose then to interject.</p><p>“Don’t let her scowl fool you. Agatha has seen her fair share of parties.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look but Wanda pointedly ignored her.</p><p>The intern looked beyond thrilled.</p><p>“You guys worked together, right?”</p><p>Wanda chuckled.</p><p>“We were at Quantico together.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the oncoming questions and her nausea returned in force.</p><p>Jen scoffed.</p><p>“What a surprise in career trajectory. Wanda is a Senior Agent, Agatha’s just come back from– what was it? Enforced sabbatical? Who did you kill to set yourself back so far?”</p><p>The temperature in the space dropped noticeably as Agatha felt her lips press together tightly, her jaw clenching.</p><p>Wanda’s tone was measured, forceful, when she intervened.</p><p>“That’s enough, Kale.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to launch across the cabin and throttle the woman. She pulled in a heavy breath and turned away, grateful to her past self for keeping her sunglasses on. She couldn’t speak because whatever came out would be too revealing and none of these people deserved to see her pain displayed so openly.</p><p>Silence sat stale and heavy, nobody sure how to ease the sudden tension.</p><p>Agatha’s history with Rio, her son, wasn't common knowledge for anyone that hadn’t been at the WFO. They’d done the proper paperwork and kept things professional in their careers; each being placed on separate teams, separate task forces.</p><p>Agatha retreated to her mind entirely, letting the rest of them figure out how to ease back into normality.</p><p>It was the intern, several minutes later, that quietly cleared his throat and asked if anyone needed a water.</p><p>—————</p><p>Six hours into the flight, Agatha felt a strange sense of deja vu. She hadn’t left the country since her last assignment with Wanda.</p><p>It was two months after Nicky’s death, her first case back. They had flown to Phuket, Thailand in pursuit of a fugitive they’d been hunting for two years. Elias Caldwell, a hacker that had wreaked havoc on the East coast; targeting infrastructure and triggering power outages. They’d been close to an arrest a few times but he’d always managed to disappear.</p><p>Agatha and Wanda had landed and spent two agonizing weeks following a digital trail to a secluded villa outside of the town.</p><p>The whole time, Agatha had been bitter and angry and she’d chafed against Wanda’s care and questions until her soul was raw. By the time they’d raided the man’s home, Agatha’s mind had become a slave to her grief and fury.</p><p>There had been a standoff against hired guards at the entrances to the property, automatic-weapon fire spraying into the police vehicles and kicking up dirt on their boots.</p><p>Something had felt wrong to Agatha as the Royal Thai Police returned fire, eradicating the threats. There was an impending sense of tragedy, the weight of horror to be revealed.</p><p>They’d moved in, checking the downed guards, and Agatha had noticed their small forms– thin and gangly– with a pit in her stomach. She’d pulled the mask of one and found a teen, no older than fourteen. The one beside him had been even younger. Caldwell had hired children, had promised to care for their families, and had let them die.</p><p>Agatha didn’t remember much of what happened in the duration of that raid. Something in her, already fragile, had snapped. She’d been near mindless, a vicious, primal thing.</p><p>She’d been the first to find Elias. She’d lost all sense of self-preservation, all awareness beyond the intent to break and hurt and destroy. He’d sliced at her with a machete, cut ribbons across her shoulders and arms as she pursued him.</p><p>She remembered his terror; remembered how good it had felt to wrap her hands around his throat and squeeze.</p><p>Wanda had pulled her off after he was already gone, so angry and so afraid <i>for</i> Agatha. She’d stared at Agatha like she was a stranger, but she’d protected her like family.</p><p>Wanda had relayed the fight, pointed to the many wounds on Agatha’s body, and claimed self-defense. It had been easier there, less restrictions placed on law-enforcement in using lethal force.</p><p>The flight back, Wanda had sat in front of her with a severity she rarely showed. She’d given Agatha an ultimatum.</p><p>
<i>”You can’t be in the field, Agatha. You aren’t ready and you are going to get yourself or someone else killed. If this had happened stateside there’s no telling how long the internal investigation might have taken. You could lose your entire future by pulling a stunt like that.” Agatha didn’t respond, nearly catatonic. Wanda picked up her hands. “Relegate yourself to desk duty or I’ll go over your head.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t argued. She hadn’t had the strength to fight or persuade the SAC that she was fine. And Rio… They’d been nearly silent to one another since Nicky’s funeral, a simmering anger and a shared grief that had driven them apart instead of into one another’s arms. Agatha had been staying in Nicky’s room, had clung to his clothes that still smelled like him and cried into his pillow.</p><p>When Agatha had gone home after the mission to Thailand, she could see on Rio’s face that she’d known. Could see that Wanda had called her.</p><p>But Rio had remained silent, eyes passing judgment she had no right to feel.</p><p>The next months had been torturous, spending days with her head buried in paperwork, letting her relationships drift away inch by inch until she was stranded. She’d quietly moved out when Nicky’s things no longer carried any trace of him.</p><p>Agatha blinked, pushing away the memory. The others on the flight were in various stages of quiet; the intern was reading a horrendously large novel, Alice had headphones wrapped over her head, and Lilia had somehow fallen back asleep. She didn’t seek out Wanda, worried she’d find her watching.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and pretended to sleep.</p><p>___________</p><p>After landing, their team was greeted by a crowd. Two members of the Hellenic Police, Interpol and Europol agents, and a legal attaché from the Embassy were ready and waiting upon their arrival.</p><p>Greetings were quick, somewhat terse, and then they were packed into SUVs with diplomatic plates and ferried to the Joint Operations Center that had been established for the remainder of their stay. A small force of Hellenic Police would be working with them side by side until the case was solved or stalled.</p><p>Their driver spoke English with a thick accent. She explained that they would meet the other task force on the case and then they could be taken to the consulate house to get settled.</p><p>They traveled for thirty minutes into the heart of Athens and pulled up in front of what they were told was an old government office that had recently been renovated to incorporate modern security measures. It wasn’t obvious at first glance that there was anything special about the building. But if one looked closer, they’d see the dozens of security cameras and a handful of security personnel in plainclothes that were staying close to the building.</p><p>They were approached as they climbed out of their cars, a woman in her mid-forties with a severe face and jet-black hair. She stood rigid, like she was at attention, but her eyes were hard, laced with a mild contempt.</p><p>“Welcome to the Aegis Center. I am Major Daskalakis. My team will be leading this investigation in the coming days. We look forward to your input.” She turned. “Please follow me.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced, already dreading the hurdles they’d have to bound in order to complete the task. In her experience, joint task forces were either efficient– each part working together to complete the case– or brittle– filled with competing egos and suspicion.</p><p>Wanda was the first to follow, disregarding the slight of not being able to introduce herself or her team.</p><p>“Supervisory Special Agent Maximoff.”</p><p>Daskalakis glanced at her.</p><p>“Not the Director.” She pursed her lips dismissively. “Seems this case is not nearly as important as your constant harassment of my team has made it seem.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows raised. She could tell the entire team was paying close attention to the conversation as well. Alice’s hackles seemed raised and Jen looked offended. The intern looked like he expected to be arrested at any moment.</p><p>Wanda answered levelly.</p><p>“I assure you that this case is of highest priority.”</p><p>She didn’t argue the comment about harassment or attempt to convince Daskalakis of their intentions.</p><p>A small part of Agatha, the part that hadn’t written Wanda out her heart, was proud of the woman she had become. She truly embodied the disposition of a leader; her emotions regulated and kept under control when necessary.</p><p>The doors of the building were opened to them and the next twenty minutes had them being methodically entered into the security database as protocols were read to them like a criminal sentence.</p><p>Soon they were passing into an expansive room with dozens of screens and a large, oval table that could fit up to sixteen.</p><p>The Major nodded toward the space.</p><p>“Central Command.” She pointed to a door to the right. “Cyber Hub.” She pointed to an open hallway to the left. “Operations Wing. There is also a rest area down that hall.”</p><p>Wanda took it all in.</p><p>“I’d like to introduce the teams.”</p><p>The Major turned to look at her.</p><p>“I’m sure that can be arranged after you’ve dropped off your luggage.”</p><p>It was as close to a dismissal as the Major could get without outright shooing Wanda away.</p><p>Wanda offered a polite smile.</p><p>“Thank you for your consideration but we’re ready now.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to laugh. Dick measuring competitions were always more fun when they were between women.</p><p>Major Daskalakis tensed but said nothing else as she guided them into the Operations Wing. There were four others gathered, their eyes all falling to the door as it opened. The Major introduced her team in short order.</p><p>“Captain Markou. He’ll lead when I am away.”</p><p>A man with brown, mid-length hair and a full beard nodded toward them.</p><p>“Lieutenant Vassilakis.”</p><p>A woman in her thirties with long, dirty-blonde hair pulled into a tight ponytail and slicked to her scalp focused her attention but did not offer a greeting.</p><p>“Corporal Kallistratos.”</p><p>The last member present was older, around the Major’s age. He had the warmest greeting, his stubbled cheeks pulling in a smile. His hair was short and slicked back, his skin deeply tanned.</p><p>The Major focused her attention on Wanda.</p><p>“Constables will be at their disposal when necessary.”</p><p>Wanda nodded and wasted no time returning the introduction.</p><p>“I’m Agent Maximoff. These are Agents Harkness, Wu-Gulliver, Calderu, and Kale.” She looked to the intern. “William is not an agent and will remain in the JOC for the duration of our time here.”</p><p>The Major offered a false smile.</p><p>“Great. Please let us know when you’re settled and we can get started.”</p>

<p>Agatha was sitting in the common room of the consulate house with her brow furrowed in thought. They’d been here for three weeks. Three entire weeks without anything new cropping up to give insight or direction on the case. Working with the Hellenic unit had been nothing short of infuriating. Their efforts felt lackluster at best, nearly disruptive at their worst. They questioned, pressed, and argued every suggestion by the team. <i>”There is no evidence to suggest she was ever on Crete. Credit cards are stolen constantly. We have local constables on high-alert and nothing has come back. Going there would be a waste of time.” “The nightclub has offered everything they are able within reason. We are not going to rip into their finances on the whim of an intern that they may have dirty dealings.” “We’ve already interviewed every witness and we’ve provided the information we gathered. Are you dead set on wasting our time?”</i></p><p>Agatha was growing restless, antsy. She missed Senor Scratchy; the blurry photos Billy was sending her from Vision’s phone were ridiculous but she found herself waiting on every one. Often he was sitting on the ground, the bunny in his lap and a toothy smile on his face so reminiscent of Nicky that it killed her just a tiny bit every time.</p><p>The rest of the team wasn’t faring any better with Jen’s frustration making her snappy and Alice, the intern, and Lilia trying to keep some semblance of peace and productivity.</p><p>If they didn’t find a lead within the next week they would be packed up and sent home. Yet here she was, relegated to the walls of the consulate house. Her and Alice were given a rotational day off while Wanda, Jennifer, and Lilia worked from the ROC. Jen and Lilia would be taking theirs the next day and the intern was being forced to take both days despite his complaints.</p><p>Agatha had never been good at days off and now she was staring at the only provided television in the entire house, her eyes locked on the hours and hours of footage from the club the night of Georgina’s disappearance.</p><p>Something felt wrong. She couldn’t place her finger on the why, but it seemed as if the Hellenic unit was aiming to close the case as cold, as unsolved.</p><p>A clip from around two in the morning played out across the screen. Agatha squinted, her eyes narrowing in on a pair of oxford dress boots that appeared on the screen, the legs wearing them in gray slacks and– Agatha blinked, waited for the rest of the body to come into frame, but even the shoes had vanished.</p><p>She rewound, played it again. Shoes, ankles… nothing.</p><p>“Intern!”</p><p>It only took a few seconds for the intern to fly into the room, his eyes wide in excitement.</p><p>“Did you find something?”</p><p>She didn’t ask how he knew she’d been watching, nor did she complain when Alice walked in after him. At least in this case, the more eyes, the better.</p><p>“Look at the shoes.” The intern blinked helplessly and Agatha pointed. “Top left corner of the screen. Watch.”</p><p>The intern moved closer and watched as Agatha replayed the scene. It was clear as day now, impossible to miss once found.</p><p>The intern seemed perplexed but Alice let out a huff.</p><p>“Holy shit. The footage has been doctored.”</p><p>Agatha replayed it once more and the intern finally caught it. He whirled, face pensive.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, I should have seen this. I watched the footage so many times.”</p><p>Alice waved him off, eyes calculating.</p><p>“Agatha has been here for three hours watching this film. Whoever did this is very good. They probably hoped that the cloudy image would make it near impossible to see.”</p><p>The intern frowned.</p><p>“Why not just remove the boots entirely?”</p><p>Agatha pointed.</p><p>“Look. There’s a strobe light that’s changing the exposure of the camera on a repeating<br/>
pattern. Whoever doctored this had to find the closest matching clip to patch it together.”</p><p>Alice nodded, anger simmering in her expression.</p><p>“If there is one lie, there are many. This can’t be the only thing they’re hiding.”</p><p>The intern looked stumped.</p><p>“Why would they do this?”</p><p>Agatha suddenly stood, her eyes sharp with determination.</p><p>“Because there’s somebody or something important they are protecting.” Agatha pulled out her phone and pulled up the hotel’s phone number. “Short of flying to Crete and seeing this for ourselves—” she held up a finger. “Which I’m keeping in consideration— We can try to leverage the information out of the hotel management.”</p><p>The intern tried to peer over her shoulder at the screen.</p><p>“How would we do that?</p><p>Agatha grimaced at him and regained her personal space with a sidestep, searching the hotel’s name in google.</p><p>“We may not have access to anything remotely helpful outside of the ROC, but certain fines and legal cases are accessible by the public.”</p><p>The first page of links that appeared were relatively useless: labor disputes, several suicides, media coverage of a mild sex scandal. Agatha looked at the last link with a grin tugging up her lips.</p><p>“Gotcha.”</p><p>She clicked and began reading, eyes pouring over the new article from fifteen years prior.</p><p>“In 2009, Paradise Bay was shut down due to severe environmental law violations including the allowance of gray water into nearby natural water sources. It was reopened in 2013 and named The Seaside Retreat.”</p><p>Alice typed the name into her phone.</p><p>“Seaside Retreat has almost nothing connected to it. If they’ve had any legal issues they haven’t been made public.”</p><p>The intern looked over Alice’s shoulder and she let him.</p><p>“Is the new hotel owned by the same company?”</p><p>Alice searched and shook her head.</p><p>“Not that I can see, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a connection.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the frozen image on the screen, her eyes narrowed in thought. She looked at Alice.</p><p>“Call Jen. Have her look into the ownership.”</p><p>“Why don’t you call her?”</p><p>Agatha offered her an incredulous look.</p><p>“Just call. Make sure she’s alone; tell her not to search the current name. It’ll raise all sorts of flags. Just have her look for Paradise Bay.”</p><p>Alice was already dialing.</p><p>___________</p><p>The intern had been the designated note-taker as Alice remained on the phone with Jen and Agatha pulled information on the original owner.</p><p>Things came to a head an hour later.</p><p>Agatha pointed at the intern.</p><p>“Summit Investments. Shell corporation connected to the original owner Fotini Karagianni and many of his businesses.”</p><p>Alice swung around from her pacing, eyes wide.</p><p>“Eleni Michailidi is the current owner of Seaside Retreat. She had connections to Summit Investments in her previous organization before leaving to purchase and reopen the hotel.”</p><p>The intern was scribbling words across the page in the most atrocious handwriting Agatha had ever seen.</p><p>Agatha snatched the phone from Alice’s hand.</p><p>“Thanks so much for your help, Jen. I hope it rains on your day off.”</p><p>She hung up the phone and turned with an untrammeled amount of glee.</p><p>“What are the odds that Fotini and Eleni are still connected?” Agatha tugged the intern’s notebook into her hands, looking at the contact information Jen had been able to provide. “If we can put pressure on the right people we can get the information we need.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened, hand catching Agatha’s wrist.</p><p>“You can’t just blackmail a Greek citizen for information, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“It’s not blackmail! It’s just applying a bit of pressure.”</p><p>Alice didn’t let go.</p><p>“Pressure? You’re going to get us fucking fired!”</p><p>Agatha dislodged Alice’s grip and walked through the house until she located the additional gear provided by the FBI. She withdrew a burner phone and powered it up before returning to the common room. She made eye contact with the intern.</p><p>“Go. When they ask about this, tell them I made you leave before we ever started asking questions.” He attempted to argue but Agatha shook her head, expression stern. “Kid, you do a good job. You’re smart. You need plausible deniability in order to keep your job.”</p><p>He slumped but sighed.</p><p>“Fine. But I want to be there when you break the news. Captain Markou really pisses me off.”</p><p>Agatha waited until he was gone before turning her attention to Alice.</p><p>“You don’t have to be here either.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes but dropped into the nearest chair.</p><p>“That is leagues outside of protocol and I think Sharon might apparate just to strangle you.” She pressed her fingers into her temples. “We’re going to get arrested.”</p><p>Agatha put in Eleni’s contact information.</p><p>“That’s not usually the case. I mean, I’ve been detained…” Agatha dragged out the word, implying there may be more to it. “But normally there’s a slap on the wrist and a really pissed off SAC that yells at you in public and gives you the nod in private.”</p><p>Alice peered at Agatha from over her hands. .</p><p>“You’ve done this before?”</p><p>Agatha waved dismissively.</p><p>“Sure. Hundreds of times.” At Alice’s look, she shrugged. “Twice. One and a half times. Canada doesn’t count because we work with them constantly. Germany was a shitshow but when you’re right, you don’t normally get the book thrown at you.”</p><p>Agatha pressed dial and put the phone on speaker. It rang twice and was answered.</p><p>“Seaside Retreat, how may I assist you today?”</p><p>Agatha did her best impression of an American news anchor, removing the lilt in her accent, sounding as straight-line as possible.</p><p>“Hello, this is Clara Ashford! I’m a freelance journalist here looking into—“</p><p>The attendant responded quickly.</p><p>“We are not interested, good d—“</p><p>Agatha returned the interruption.</p><p>“Oh! I think Miss Michailidi will want to get ahead of the story I’m about to break.”</p><p>There was a long pause, then:</p><p>“Can I place you on a brief hold?”</p><p>Agatha waggled her brows at Alice. They only had to wait a minute before the other line reopened.</p><p>“If you’re calling to threaten me, I would advise against it.”</p><p>Agatha laughed lightly.</p><p>“No, no, of course not. I’m offering a trade of favors.”</p><p>Eleni’s voice was terse.</p><p>“I can’t imagine what I could need from an American tourist. You are severely lacking in negotiating power.”</p><p>Agatha tssked, her voice remaining light. This was where she hedged her bets. She’d either get what she wanted or a laugh.</p><p>“That’s where you’re wrong. Unfortunately for you, the <i>clean-up</i> of your hotel’s waste disposal was simply redirected and not corrected.”</p><p>“You’re speculating.”</p><p>Agatha heard the subtle turn in the woman’s tone like a victory bell. Alice had heard it too if the way she leaned forward in her seat was any indication.</p><p>“Sure. Let’s say I don’t have any evidence ready to put Karagianni back into a tangle of legal trouble. It makes sense that I would call before gathering that.”</p><p>Her mocking became more apparent near the end but the name drop had the effect she hoped.</p><p>Eleni remained quiet, thinking, before biting out:</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Agatha wanted to laugh, her adrenaline spiking, but she remained calm.</p><p>“I need the hotel’s CCTV footage from November 13th.”</p><p>Eleni scoffed.</p><p>“That’s it? What could possibly be—“</p><p>Now it was time to redirect.</p><p>“My husband recently took a trip with his college friends and somehow ended up on Crete. I’m confirming a few things. You understand.”</p><p>Eleni did huff out a laugh now, her tone less terse. She breathed out “stupid fucking American” in Greek before reverting to English again.</p><p>“I will send the footage. Tell me where.”</p><p>Agatha provided one of a hundred unconnected email accounts that agents had access to only through the use of a VPN. Silence followed, the file being located and transferred.</p><p>After several minutes, Eleni spoke.</p><p>“It is done.”</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“Excellent. I’ll parse through to make sure you didn’t play me for a stupid American and return the favor. You can expect no mention of your name in my exposé.”</p><p>Agatha hung up the phone, her hands nearly vibrating with the heady thrill of being so fucking good at her job.</p><p>Alice was staring at her in mild awe and stunned disbelief.</p><p>“There’s no way that worked. There’s no fucking way.” Her arms crossed over her chest. “We just committed a crime.”</p><p>Agatha grinned like a shark.</p><p>“Isn’t it exhilarating?”</p><p>She disconnected her computer from the television and logged into the protected email. There, sitting in her inbox as promised, was a massive zip file.</p><p>Agatha impatiently allowed the dozens of folders to be scanned and cleared of viruses before she opened the first one.</p><p>Sure enough, Seaside Retreat had four security cameras active at any given time. Agatha reconnected the computer and sat down with a warm buzzing under her skin.</p><p>__________</p><p> </p><p>The Captain, Markou, was standing with his arms crossed, looking at her as if she were insane. Agatha refrained from raising her voice only because of the delicate nature of the case, but she slapped down the manilla folder in her hand loud enough to draw attention.</p><p>“Is this the kind of methodology you practice in your own investigations or are you simply a poltroon with a switch constantly at your heels to keep you in line?”</p><p>She could see his lips thin in the mess of his beard. He leaned toward her, trying to tower, trying to intimidate.</p><p>“I hope you’ll remember that you are a guest here, Agent Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha sneered.</p><p>“I thought it was a general practice to put a good foot forward with one’s guests?”</p><p>Captain Markou bit out a sharp response.</p><p>“Only when those guests are invited.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her words laced with the frustration and venom she felt coursing through her veins.</p><p>“Ineptitude often requires correction by a large force.”</p><p>Markou stepped even closer, his chest nearly aligned with Agatha’s. He was taller but his constant posturing was feeding Agatha’s ego. Before he could snap back, he was interrupted by Wanda’s voice.</p><p>“Agent Harkness, Captain Markou.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t retreat. She had the upper hand and she held onto it with an iron grasp. Captain Markou backed away like a churlish child.</p><p>Wanda made her way to them, eyes on Agatha.</p><p>“Explain.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“They kept footage from us.” She nodded to the screen Markou was not-so-subtly trying to cover with his body. “We’ve been here for weeks with no new leads.” Agatha reached into the Captain’s space to push the screen into Wanda’s view. “But there were cameras on the property. This is footage from the same day that the victim’s card was used.”</p><p>The Captain looked to be shaking with anger.</p><p>“You are not permitted to perform investigatory work without an escort or explicit permission.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression was severe as she looked over the blurry image of a woman getting into an old-school Porsche. There was no way to identify her as Georgina, but the height, hair color, and body were similar enough that it should have been entered into evidence.</p><p>Alice stepped in.</p><p>“This car is a vintage Porsche 911. I’d put the total number of these cars from the seventies and eighties in Greece at about fifty to one hundred models. But this isn’t just any model. This is the Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7. Only fifteen-hundred were made and I would bet my badge that there are only one or two of these actually in the country.” Alice shot a glare at the Captain. “One or two means easy identification of the owner. It means that they looked, identified a name, and buried the lead.”</p><p>Wanda took everything in with a level expression before narrowing her attention on the Captain.</p><p>“Bring in Major Daskalakis.”</p><p>Markou bristled.</p><p>“You don’t give me orders.”</p><p>Wanda nearly snarled, the first time Agatha had seen her truly lose her cool since they began working together again.</p><p>“The fallout from this is far above your pay grade, Captain. I expect your Major here within the hour.”</p><p>As he turned– petulant– he called back.</p><p>“You better detain your agents to the ROC, Maximoff.”</p><p>Wanda watched him leave before her attention fell to Agatha. She was seething.</p><p>“Harkness, get your ass into interrogation room two. Claderu, ensure she doesn’t take the scenic route.”</p><p>Alice stepped forward.</p><p>“Agent Maximoff, I was also—“</p><p>Wanda cut her off sharply.</p><p>“I am fully aware, Agent Wu. You and I will be speaking.”</p><p>Alice didn’t shrink away. Agatha could see she had already decided that the consequences of their actions had been worth it.</p><p>Lilia and Jen had watched this unfold with perfect poker faces. Now, as Agatha allowed herself to be dismissed, she felt Lilia’s hand on her back.</p><p>Lilia leaned in and whispered.</p><p>“You didn’t get William into the middle of all of this, right?”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“Of course not. He’s at the consulate house reading his encyclopedia.”</p><p>They walked through the halls of the ROC and Lilia patted Agatha’s back and laughed.</p><p>“Good on you.” She continued laughing. “And they said I was crazy.”</p><p>A strange and warm sensation curled in Agatha’s chest at the somewhat backhanded praise. She wasn’t sure how to respond to it. She didn’t need or want the validation of her peers; it had never been of any importance to her. Even so, she had to fight a smile that threatened to split her face.</p><p>“I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Lilia snorted.</p><p>“Oh, I know.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look as they reached the door to the interrogation room.</p><p>“That was layered.”</p><p>Lilia’s brows raised at Agatha.</p><p>“I’ve been around a long time, Agatha. I’m not nearly as hot-headed as Jennifer and I’m far more nosy than Alice.” She reached for the handle and offered a smile. “I know history when I see it. You and Maximoff have it. It’s in the fabric of every interaction you share. But you and Director Vidal?” Lilia blew out a breath. “I am in the business of knowing people. It’s always been my gift. You don’t get a personal visit from the SAC for something as small as a conflict of interest. You don’t get a slap on the wrist for putting your hands on them.” Lilia leaned into Agatha’s growing discomfort. “And you definitely don’t have such an effect on their emotional output that they are particularly incensed after a single conversation. That kind of anger feeds off of deep knowing.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, the pleased feeling that had eased into her chest entirely gutted out.</p><p>“This is fun.”</p><p>Lilia shrugged.</p><p>“You have a habit of causing discomfort. I think you could use a dose of it yourself every now and then.”</p><p>“I’ll take a hard pass.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled again and the sound was beginning to grate.</p><p>“I’ve never seen you give others that option.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond because there was no defense for it. She slapped her hand over Lilia’s to swing the handle open and let herself into the interrogation room. She slammed it behind her before Lilia could offer any more insights into her past.</p><p>As soon as she was alone, a tired laugh escaped her throat and the adrenaline crash had her slumping into the metal, bolted chair and closing her eyes.</p><p>_____________</p><p>She was woken to the sound of the door flinging open and turned her attention to– Agatha rolled her eyes– Major Daskalakis.</p><p>“What an honor.”</p><p>The Major planted herself across from Agatha with a very similar disposition to the one she’d held the first time she introduced herself. Dismissive, annoyed.</p><p>“Please, make a mockery of your situation. It’ll aid my intent to prosecute.”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“You need sufficient evidence to prosecute even your own citizens. How do you plan to prosecute an American citizen without it?” Agatha tilted her head in thought. “I guess you could be hiding evidence?” She pressed her hand to her chest. “But your team would never do that.”</p><p>“We’re not discussing my team.”</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>“We’re not discussing anything until I have a legal rep here.” Agatha looked toward the door. “I don’t think you’re supposed to be in here right now, Major. Where’s your Chief of Police? Where’s our liaison? Agent Maximoff?” Agatha tssked and allowed the woman to sit in the building tension before leaning forward and adding in a whisper. “I think your Captain Markou is going to be sitting before a judge far sooner than me.”</p><p>God, Agatha loved twisting people into knots. She watched the Major’s expression flicker and partially hoped she was about to get slapped. It would help her case.</p><p>Instead, the Major stood.</p><p>“Enjoy sleeping in this chair, Agent Harkness. Your SAC won’t be getting here until tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha bit back the immediate question that wanted to follow. A strange mix of trepidation and anticipation buzzed in her chest. Agatha stared at the stainless steel table and pursed her lips.</p><p>Rio was going to be so mad.</p><p>The anticipation made itself more prominent and Agatha settled in for an agonizing wait.</p><p>______________</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s body positively ached from hours of being stuck in the interrogation room. Wanda could easily have gotten her out and placed in a more comfortable confinement room, but Agatha was pretty certain she was playing politics, building trust. She also likely thought Agatha deserved it.</p><p>Agatha wondered how Alice was fairing, surprising even herself with the mild consideration. Wu was tough. And she was smart. She wouldn’t say anything at all and both of them would be back in action once things were sorted.</p><p>Near midnight, Agatha was finally taken to a solitary room with a cot and lights that turned off. She sat against the wall and thought about the first time she’d gotten into a situation like this.</p><p>Wanda had been just as angry; they’d both been detained at the US Embassy in Berlin for two days while the situation was sorted. Granted, it hadn’t been as dicey a situation at the time. And the BKA officers working with them had been amused rather than enraged. The Criminal Director had pushed for their release within hours.</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>It hadn’t even been her fault. Not really. They’d completed a raid and Agatha had followed a suspect out because they’d taken a hostage. She was alone and protocol was to stay put and wait for back-up. Agatha had pursued them through the warehouses and waited for the right moment to take her shot.</p><p>When she’d gotten home, Rio had cracked the cap of a beer and pressed it into her hands with words of exasperation and love intermingled.</p><p>Agatha fell asleep with the memory of Rio’s smile pressed against her mouth.</p><p>——————</p><p>Early the next morning, the room still dark in the pre-dawn light, there was a knock on her door. It opened moments later and Agatha saw Wanda’s red hair reflected in the light over the silhouette of her.</p><p>Wanda flicked on the light and Agatha hissed, eyes closed against the shock.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda seemed serious but her anger had dissipated into acceptance. She gave Agatha a tired look.</p><p>“Let’s go, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha licked the front of her teeth in disgust.</p><p>“Can I at least brush my teeth?”</p><p>Wanda walked out without an answer and Agatha groaned as she stood.</p><p>She saw Alice walking out of a room down the hall and winked at her. Alice chuckled and shook her head.</p><p>Agatha was able to clean herself up and change clothes before being walked to one of the larger conference rooms. Major Daskalakis was sitting beside a woman Agatha had not met. She was in her late fifties and had short white hair. From her uniform, Agatha assumed she was the Chief.</p><p>There were an array of other representatives attending from Internal Affairs on either side to legal counsel of the HPD to members of the US Embassy. Nobody looked happy.</p><p>Alice and Agatha sat down in the center of the table, Wanda on Alice’s left.</p><p>After an enduring silence, Agatha leaned forward.</p><p>“So where’s your guy, Markou?”</p><p>The Major’s face turned a bright red but a hand from the Chief kept her silent. The Chief rattled off the same list of prosecutions the Major had the day before.</p><p>Agatha huffed and was about to respond when Wanda cleared her throat pointedly.</p><p>“Let’s wait for the remainder of our delegation before proceeding.”</p><p>The Chief gave Agatha her full attention as the door opened at their back.</p><p>“You seem inclined to make this difficult, Agent Harkness.”</p><p>A voice Agatha had tried to prepare for slithered up her spine, circled her throat, and pooled into her ears.</p><p>“I assure you all of my agents will exhibit decorum through the remainder of these proceedings.”</p><p>All eyes on the room besides Agatha’s turned to Rio, taking her in, weighing her. Agatha knew what they’d find.</p><p>Rio, when it came to her job, was a force of nature. She carried herself with the self-possession and assurance of somebody who believed they were the most powerful person in any room. Agatha had watched many shrink in her presence.</p><p>At least the Police Chief kept her composure. She stood and reached across the table.</p><p>“Director Vidal, welcome to Greece. It’s unfortunate it’s under such unpleasant circumstances. I am Chief of Police, Ariadni Koutsou.”</p><p>She introduced the major and her legal team but Agatha could only focus on the hands that settled on the back of the chair beside her.</p><p>Rio responded.</p><p>“You know my team, meet our Legal Counsel, Sharon Davis.”</p><p>Agatha turned for the first time in disbelief, her eyes catching on strong cut of Rio’s suit and the soft turn of her mouth on their to the short PTA mom taking a seat two chairs away. She looked like she was ready for a bake sale, not like the lawyer that would drag Agatha away Scott-free.</p><p>Sharon began to recount the circumstances of the case for her own understanding as Rio took the chair beside Agatha. She didn’t look over.</p><p>Agatha straightened in her seat.</p><p>For the next several minutes, Sharon recounted the events as had been delivered to her.</p><p>“...Agents Harkness and Wu-Gulliver identified alterations in the CCTV footage provided by your team. They then acquired a file with footage dated November 13th–”</p><p>The Major across the table interrupted.</p><p>“Illegally obtained.”</p><p>Sharon’s brows lifted, a disappointed look on her face.</p><p>“Now, I know it is not polite to interrupt. You also should be aware that there is no evidence at this time to suggest criminal activity on the parts of these Agents. To imply such without that evidence is going to make this more difficult for your own legal team.” She paused for effect. “As I was saying. This footage depicts an unidentified individual entering a distinct vehicle at the Seaside Retreat Hotel, a location where the victim’s card had been utilized. This information was withheld from the knowledge of the FBI, and it has been confirmed that it was also withheld from the greater position of the Hellenic Police Department. Captain Markou is the primary suspect in this matter and is currently being prosecuted on charges of Evidence Tampering, Obstruction of Justice, Official Misconduct, Perjury, and Conspiracy. Please confirm if this understanding is accurate.”</p><p>The legal counsel, a man in his early forties with dyed-brown hair and thin glasses, cleared his throat.</p><p>“That is correct. However, it should be stated that both Agents, Wu-Gulliver and Harkness, will be under investigation for the foreseeable future until it can be proven whether there was a breach of sovereignty and law.”</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“We’re wasting valuable time–”</p><p>A hand landed on Agatha’s leg, squeezing in warning, as Rio’s head turned.</p><p>“Agent Harkness, please refrain from speaking unless you’re asked a direct question.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth snapped shut, her body locking up at the touch.</p><p>Major Daskalakis huffed.</p><p>“At least you can keep a gag on your Agents.”</p><p>Rio’s focus returned across the table, her dark gaze landing on the Major.</p><p>“Due to the actions committed, by Markou’s own admission, there is a real possibility that your victim is dead, gone, or has suffered greatly at the hands of her captors. While I will permit an investigation into my Agents out of respect, I will tolerate very little in terms of their degradation. Am I clear?”</p><p>Throughout Rio’s sharp address, her hand had squeezed tightly around Agatha’s thigh. She slowly released her grip but kept her hand in place.</p><p>The Chief placed a hand on the table.</p><p>“We will keep the interactions civil.”</p><p>__________</p><p>Two hours, countless questions, and a quickly unraveling sense of self-preservation later and Agatha was reaching her limit. She felt wrung out, overheated, and violently irritated.</p><p>Rio’s hand had remained in place, the warmth of her palm radiating into Agatha’s leg. Every time Agatha had even begun a sentence with a tone Rio didn’t like, there was a biting pressure of blunt nails into her skin. The thin layer of fabric did nothing to diminish the sensation. Agatha had mixed feelings of agitation and desperation. She knew that Rio was intent on keeping things respectful, calm. It was the best method to reach a peaceful conclusion.</p><p>It was working too. Agatha couldn’t function with Rio’s hand on her, couldn’t form snide remarks, couldn’t goad the Major, couldn’t offer underhanded insults about Markou. Even Wanda seemed to be looking at her every few minutes like she expected Agatha to mouth off.</p><p>Alice answered the many questions monotone and without hesitation or stumble. Agatha felt jealousy at the fact that she was allowed to complete this interrogation without their Director’s talons in her leg.</p><p>The Chief of Police listened closely, intently, as they both answered similarly.</p><p>
<i>“I was not aware of any law that I might break by procuring this information.” “Yes, I knew that I was acting without the direct permission of the HPD.” “Our actions were not taken until we discovered the doctoring of the CCTV footage.” “I did not alert Agent Maximoff due to her position and responsibility.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha tried to pull her leg away after a particularly sharp press of nails. She hadn’t even done anything! She was thinking about doing something but it’s not like Rio knew that. Instead of Rio’s hand falling off, it slid higher, her fingers against her inner thigh, her knuckles brushing the other leg. Agatha bit her lip tightly.</p><p>The Chief of Police cleared her throat.</p><p>“I appreciate your candidness and civility in answering these questions. While I expect we are not being told full truths, I will be suggesting that this situation be handled internally by your organization. We will request disciplinary action but otherwise settle this diplomatically.”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“I believe that returning our attention to the case is the best decision. Thank you for your forbearance and rest assured that both Agent Harkness and Agent Wu-Gulliver will receive  proper reprimand and corrective discipline.”</p><p>Agatha was boiling over. Her lungs and throat hurt from the amount of times she’d held her breath, the amount of times her words got caught in her chest because of Rio’s fucking audacity.</p><p>Rio’s hand withdrew from her leg and she stood.</p><p>“Keep me informed if the decision changes after an internal discussion. I need to have a conversation with my Agents.”</p><p>Rio walked out because she knew she would be followed. Sharon trotted happily at her heels and Alice and Wanda were close behind. Agatha took a deep breath, the last to stand, and bit back the slew of comments one more time so that she didn’t give them a reason to reconsider. She let her eyes fall on the Major and allowed a single smirk, the smallest lift of her lips, before turning heel and walking toward her reckoning.</p><p>As soon as she stepped outside she felt Rio’s eyes. She pointedly ignored her and turned to Alice.</p><p>“See. Slap on the wrist.”</p><p>Wanda looked like she was about to snap again.</p><p>Rio spoke quietly.</p><p>“Agent Maximoff, please take the team back to the consulate house. I’ll be there after I tie up some loose ends.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, leaving, and Agatha followed because even the chance to breathe outside of Rio’s orbit for a few moments might allow her to clear her head for whatever was coming.</p><p>____________</p><p>The ride back to the consulate house was eerily quiet. Upon their arrival, Wanda was out first, her face set, her eyes locking onto Agatha as she addressed the entire team.</p><p>“Living room. Now.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows but followed the order with little protest. The sooner the beratement occurred, the sooner she could sleep in a real bed.</p><p>She’d barely sat in one of the chairs, Jen, Lilia, and Alice taking the couch, before Wanda started in.</p><p>“The actions taken by this team today put every one of your careers in jeopardy. It put a strain on the relationship we have with law enforcement here in Greece. It risked the resolution of this case.”</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“Wanda, their withholding of evidence was–”</p><p>“Agent Harkness, their actions do not provide validation for your decision to break the law. The doctored footage was enough to launch an investigation. If you had come to me, I could have done this the right way.”</p><p>Agatha threw up a hand.</p><p>“The right way can take weeks that we do not have. They would have walked you around in circles until our only chance of finding the victim was eradicated.”</p><p>Wanda focused the force of her attention on Agatha.</p><p>“Are you questioning my ability to do my job?”</p><p>Alice attempted to intervene.</p><p>“It’s the red tape. You have to follow–”</p><p>Wanda’s head tilted sharply toward her and Alice fell silent.</p><p>“Every single one of us is subject to the red tape you so recklessly bypassed yesterday. Your lack of seniority does not remove that responsibility from your shoulders.”</p><p>Jen held up a hand.</p><p>“Can I just say, I didn’t know what the hell they were doing when they called asking for information.”</p><p>Agatha groaned loudly.</p><p>“You’re spineless, Kale.”</p><p>Jennifer’s hands pressed into her thighs as she leaned forward.</p><p>“I’m simply stating the truth. Some of us hold respect for our position and power.”</p><p>Lilia scoffed. She’d been silent until now, taking everything in.</p><p>“I’m not saying I condone this, but claiming that Alice and Agatha do not respect their position when they were attempting to right an injustice is simply absurd. Whether they were right to do what they did, they were correct.”</p><p>Wanda seemed to lose some of her fight then, her hands pressing tightly into her temples.</p><p>“You’re dismissed. Get some rest. We’re still on this case until further notice but stay prepared for a quick departure.”</p><p>Agatha pushed herself to her feet slowly, a slinking sense of guilt in her chest as the others left the room. She stopped beside Wanda.</p><p>“It wasn’t a lack of respect.”</p><p>Wanda sighed as she met Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“I know. But you made the wrong call, Agatha. You’re lucky they have no way of prosecuting.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t agree. It had been a calculated risk. One that had paid off. They always paid off.</p><p>“I am prepared for the consequences of it.”</p><p>She left then, making a beeline for her room. She just wanted to smash her face into the soft pillow and pass out for twelve hours. As she unlocked the door and pressed it open, Agatha stilled.</p><p>Rio was standing at her window, her suit jacket tossed over Agatha’s bed, her leather cross-harness still on her shoulders but sitting empty at her ribs.</p><p>“Close the door, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha did.</p><p>“This seems like an inappropriate setting for a disciplinary conversation.”</p><p>Rio turned around, eyes landing heavy on Agatha, body leaning back against the wall. Her feet crossed at the ankles.</p><p>“Do you want to lose your job?”</p><p>Agatha tugged off her jacket and tossed it over Rio’s on the bed, her memory of Rio’s hand so demanding on her leg, the continual press of nails, pounding through her skull.</p><p> </p><p>“If that’s what you’re actually threatening here, you’ve wasted a lot of fucking Bureau time and resources on me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t try to mask her anger like she had in her office. She was burning with it, bristling with it.</p><p>“It’s not a threat. It’s the outcome if you don’t get your fucking act together.” Rio moved toward her. “You’re damn lucky they don’t have anything to hold on you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“It isn’t luck. We didn’t leave a trail.”</p><p>Rio sneered. She slipped her phone from her pocket and held it out.</p><p>“Press play.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reach out to take it. Rio pressed it for her.</p><p>Agatha heard her own voice ring through, repeating back the conversation she had with Eleni. <i>“No, no, of course not. I’m offering a trade of favors.”</i></p><p>Rio paused the recording.</p><p>“You blackmailed a Greek citizen into providing you information.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha tilted her head back and forth. “A Greek criminal, technically.”</p><p>It was the wrong thing to say. Rio closed her eyes, sheer exasperation taking over her face.</p><p>“You’ll be suspended without pay upon return to DC. Pack your bags.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart crawled into her throat, her anger breaking through her body, tensing it, burning it. She stepped closer to Rio.</p><p>“What about you, Rio? I’m certain Wanda wasn’t manhandling Alice under the table to control her. Is that the behavior we can expect from our all-powerful SAC?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, eyes craving through every line of Agatha’s face looking for answers. She swallowed tightly.</p><p>“You’re right.” Rio’s eyes dropped away. “I shouldn’t have brought you back.”</p><p>The statement was a fist to Agatha’s left temple, a near-knockout blow that had Agatha locking her knees to keep from staggering. <i>”I shouldn’t have brought you back.”</i> The events of the past two months replayed like a reel, acidic in her brain.</p><p>Agatha let out a near-feral laugh.</p><p>“You?” Rio’s jaw clenched tightly, her composure slipping away as Agatha took over her space. Agatha’s hand moved in rage, fingers gripping Rio’s jaw, yanking her head up. Agatha could barely speak for her fury. “You dragged me back here like I had no choice. You said it was Wanda!”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were dark and deep and devastated, the muscles of her jaw clenching and unclenching against the press of Agatha’s fingertips.</p><p>“You were drowning.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath was coming in heavy, pained drags. Her eyes burned, her vision blurred.</p><p>“I was fine!”</p><p>Rio’s hand wrapped around Agatha’s wrist.</p><p>“You were fine? Fine?!” Rio’s voice broke as it rose, her words wavering. “You were alone! You were suffocating in your apathy. You were dying, Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe. She raised her voice to match Rio’s.</p><p>“Then let me!” Agatha shoved Rio by her jaw, sending her back into the wall. Rio stumbled but righted herself. Agatha gasped out a wet breath. “You should have let me die.”</p><p>Rio’s expression broke, the tears in her eyes finally falling. She shook her head.</p><p>“No.” She shrugged helplessly. “I won’t. I can’t.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the woman who had been her entire world for the best parts of her life. She saw the woman from before Nicky’s death. Saw the impassioned determination, the dedication, the adoration— all of it so naive in its purity. No matter the limits they tested with one another, Rio had always believed in them. Seeing it here, written in the eyes of the only person who held her heart, Agatha trembled.</p><p>And because Agatha could not handle the truth of it, the horror of Rio’s continued love, she allowed her sorrow to corrupt itself.</p><p>Agatha stepped into Rio’s body and slid her hands into Rio’s hair, nails scratching against her scalp.</p><p>“Then make me feel something else.”</p><p>Rio’s hands fell to her because what else could she do. Her hands slid against Agatha’s shoulders and up her neck</p><p>Rio kissed her like she knew it wasn’t real. Rio’s throat vibrated with a muffled sob as she pressed her body as tightly as she could against Agatha’s and broke her own rule.</p><p>Agatha kissed her back like it was real because admitting the cruelty of it would destroy her. She buried the truth and pressed Rio into the wall as their mouths slanted together, the familiar taste of her a salve to Agatha’s shredded heart.</p><p>She bit harshly against Rio’s bottom lip and did not ease the sting. Her tongue slid against Rio’s, dragged along the line of her teeth, commanded her mouth with a hand on her throat and knee pressed between her legs.</p><p>Rio’s nails dug desperately into her back, clinging and piercing as she rode Agatha’s leg. The pain of it crawled up and down Agatha’s spine, the pleasure of it coiled lower.</p><p>Agatha broke away, panting against Rio’s mouth as she yanked her belt loose. She didn’t bother with Rio’s pants, the waistline loose enough for her hand to slide under the hem. She pressed her mouth against Rio’s throat to muffle her moan as her fingers pressed against the thin, warm, soaked fabric over Rio’s cunt.</p><p>She bit the soft skin of Rio’s throat and cupped her firmly, middle finger finding purchase on Rio’s clit.</p><p>The absolutely wretched whine that left Rio’s mouth, the slight slip of her back against the wall as her knees gave out, had stars breaking on the backs of Agatha’s eyelids.</p><p>Agatha’s chest squeezed in warning and she ignored it because if she stopped now she would never recover. Just this one time she would fuck her ex-wife. She would burn it out of their systems. In the cold light of the aftermath, Rio would see Agatha’s actions for cruelty, and she would hate her for them.</p><p>Agatha caught Rio’s mouth in an open, heated press of lips. She adjusted her hand, tugged Rio’s underwear to the side and let her fingers slip through her slick folds with lazy strokes.</p><p>Rio’s head dropped back and Agatha made the mistake of looking. Rio’s eyes were closed, the mascara from her eyes streaking down her pretty, red cheeks. Her lips were swollen, the lower one bleeding lightly where Agatha’s teeth had dug in too far.</p><p>She was so beautiful. The masterpiece of an artist who loved and hated her work in equal measure. Agatha’s lips closed over Rio’s bottom one and pulled it into her mouth, tongue tasting iron as it slid across the cut.</p><p>She focused her attention, her fingers curling, pressing inside.</p><p>Agatha overwrote her desire to take her time, let her fingers drive roughly into Rio, felt the way Rio’s walls fluttered, tightened around her fingers as if to hold her in place.</p><p>Agatha pressed her forehead into Rio’s neck, buried herself there as Rio’s body grew taut, heavier in her arms. She pressed her tighter to the wall and added a third finger to her next thrust, working Rio up too quickly so neither of them could sit in the way even doing this wrong felt so right.</p><p>Rio’s nails dragged, tore skin, but she remained silent, stubborn except for the hopeless gasps that fell from her lips when Agatha pressed just right against her front wall.</p><p>Agatha felt the first shudder, the jolt of Rio’s hips into her hand, and then Rio’s back arced, her body locking as her head slammed into the wall, eyes closed tightly.</p><p>Agatha fucked her through it until the sight of Rio coming down made her never want to stop. She withdrew before Rio could open her eyes and took a full step back. She stared at Rio as she was breathing against the wall with fresh tears on her cheeks. Agatha turned around before she could say words she couldn’t mean and fled her own room.</p><p>Nobody was in the hallway when she opened her door and made her way to the small balcony at the end of it. She needed air, needed to wipe away the scent of Rio on her body and hands and mouth. She slid the door open and found Alice outside already. Agatha hesitated, debated fleeing the house entirely, when Alice’s hand reached back toward her, offering a freshly lit cigarette without question.</p><p>Agatha took it in her left hand and breathed in.</p>

<p>Agatha had stood on the narrow balcony with Alice for a time, letting the bitter smoke of the cigarette burn away the taste of Rio in her mouth. She tucked her right hand, now sticky, into the pocket of her coat. Every shift of her fingers reminded her of where they’d been, of what she’d done. Her own underwear was ruined from her body’s response but she would not be finding relief.</p><p>It felt like a dream. Like a liminal space that crafted itself into existence the moment Rio or her crossed a line, like both knew if they could go to such a place, they wouldn’t be held accountable to the damage they caused each other.</p><p>Alice hadn’t tried to start any kind of conversation for the first several minutes, her eyes watching the slow passing of cars below.</p><p>Agatha was grateful. She couldn’t think about anything but Rio. The taste, the smell, the warmth of her after five years with nothing. She felt sick; a roiling guilt clanging a punishment against her ribcage, a cutting disappointment squeezing at the base of her neck. She thought of telling Dr. Alder and grimaced.</p><p>Agatha heard the front door of the house open and kept her eyes peeled on the gate at the edge of the small yard out front. Most of it was cut off from her view but she could see a patch of green and the wrought-iron spikes of the entrance.</p><p>Rio appeared, completely remade, the streaks of tears wiped clean and the mess Agatha had made of her hair drawn neatly back into a low bun. Her blazer sat perfectly on her shoulders as she pushed through the gate, the squeal of it echoing into the surrounding area.</p><p>Steps behind, Wanda appeared. She turned to speak with somebody behind her, likely Embassy security, and motioned to the gate before following Rio out.</p><p>Agatha watched them turn down the sidewalk, Wanda’s hand pressing between Rio’s shoulder blades in an offer of comfort.</p><p>Agatha hissed, dropping the cigarette in her fingers as the smoldering end singed her skin. She clenched her teeth, eyes falling to the butt ashing and smoking on the patio tiles.</p><p>Alice offered Agatha another, retrieving a second for herself. She lit her own and held out the lighter for Agatha to take.</p><p>“You three were at Quantico together, weren’t you?”</p><p>Agatha flicked the lighter, blocking the wind with her now-dry hand as she took a drag. She grunted her affirmation.</p><p>Alice leaned against the white railing.</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>And that was it. She didn’t pry, didn’t root around Agatha’s past like a messy junk drawer or make commentary on their career paths. Besides Alice’s recount of her mom’s perception of Agatha, she had never shown any kind of interest in understanding her.</p><p>Agatha handed back the lighter and sat down on the rickety, wooden chair. She looked at Alice’s profile for several long seconds before deciding she wasn’t quite interested in understanding her either.</p><p>They remained silent for the duration of their cigarettes, Agatha snuffing hers out in time. She sank into the nicotine buzz and rode it out until she was once more left with the empty ache that had created a home for itself in her chest. She slapped a hand on her knee and stood.</p><p>“Thanks for your generosity, Wu.”</p><p>She walked back into the hallway, down it, and stopped in front of the door to her room. A visceral replay of Rio falling apart against her dried out Agatha’s mouth. She turned toward the bathroom instead to wash her hands and took the stairs down to the first floor. It was quiet but for a muted conversation from the kitchen. Agatha turned into the living room and found the intern a significant way through his heinously large book.</p><p>Agatha groaned but collapsed on the couch anyway. She grabbed a pillow and pressed it over her face.</p><p>The intern dove directly into the thousands of words he’d likely been building up since she’d banished him.</p><p>“Agatha! Holy shit, Alice said you guys were in some hot water.” He lowered his voice conspiratorially. “I totally saw Director Vidal here. I can’t believe she flew out for this. Do you think we’ll stay on the case?” He paused for her to answer but continued when she didn’t. “Are you guys getting fired? That would like, suck. You’re both my favorites.”</p><p>Agatha rolled the pillow off of her face so she could give him a disbelieving look.</p><p>“I don’t even know your name. Why are you lumping me in with Wu?”</p><p>The intern laughed.</p><p>“You know my name. You’re just grumpy. Besides, I’ve learned a lot from you and about you. You’re not as scary as you try to seem.”</p><p>Agatha groaned louder than before and reburied herself in the pillow. It smelled like old people. Her voice was muffled when she spoke.</p><p>“I’m napping. Don’t bother me unless god suddenly becomes real and is here to smite me.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, her ears picking up the subtle sounds of the home and the rhythmic pattern of the intern flipping his pages. She let herself drift off, relieved at the prospect of a few hours without thought or feeling.</p><p>____________</p><p>There was something to be said about your mind betraying you in the worst possible moments.</p><p>Agatha dreamed.</p><p>
<i>She saw a Nicky that wasn’t really Nicky. He was older than her baby had ever gotten. He had long, brown hair and his blue eyes were bright with tears. He was being dragged away by a cloaked figure, the hand on his arm made of bone and nothing else. She was trying to run for him, trying to scream, but her legs were moving like they didn’t belong to her and her voice was too hoarse to be heard over Nicky’s cries.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha fell, her knees scraping against stone, her hands scrabbling, sliding into a rough gouge.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She crawled into the dip and climbed out to find Nicky almost out of her sight. Panic choked her and she pushed herself to her feet as the cloaked figure looked back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio. Her eyes were black, lines of crimson cried down her cheeks as she continued to walk Nicky away from her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was struck still, her bloodied hands and knees dripping on the ground beneath her. When Rio turned away, Agatha found herself able to move. She sprinted but never gained ground.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her feet hit forest floor and she stumbled, leaves kicking up around her as her body hit the floor. She tried to stand and spun, trying to catch sight or sound of her son. Her eyes passed over the stone and stilled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was large, so massive in its size, but Agatha could see the shape of it from here. Square at the bottom, round at the top. Letters etched into the face of it to be read and wept over until they eroded away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha couldn’t read most of the inscription but the name at the bottom was in sharp clarity. She pressed a hand against her mouth and curled over.</i>
</p><p>Agatha blinked awake as a hand gently shook her shoulder. Her heart was pounding in her chest. She focused her blurry sight on the intern as he leaned over her with a worried frown.</p><p>“God isn’t here to smite you but you were crying.”</p><p>Agatha wiped angrily at her cheeks as she sat up.</p><p>“Allergies.”</p><p>The intern frowned.</p><p>“I don’t think dream allergies are a thing.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and leaned into the back of the couch.</p><p>“How long did I sleep?”</p><p>The intern shrugged.</p><p>“Thirty minutes. I think Lilia is cooking a meal for everyone so I figured you’d want me to wake you before somebody else… saw.”</p><p>Agatha looked around the otherwise empty room. She could hear the clanging from the kitchen now and the smell of garlic and onion and tomatoes being cooked caught in her nose. Agatha rubbed her forehead and tried to shake off the groggy film in her head. Her heartbeat was slow to settle as anxiety set in. She hadn’t had nightmares about Nicky in two years.</p><p>The intern sat next to her and hesitated.</p><p>“Um, do you– who– you said a name while you slept.”</p><p>Agatha bristled, voice sharp.</p><p>“Don’t mention it.”</p><p>The intern nodded awkwardly.</p><p>“Okay, yeah. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Footsteps sounded from the hallway and Jen appeared at the arched entrance of the living room.</p><p>“Lilia wants to know if anyone is allergic to nuts.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced but latched onto the change of subject.</p><p>“Incredibly so.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes.</p><p>“The food.”</p><p>The intern shrugged.</p><p>“Some people like the other kind in their mouth too.”</p><p>A laugh ripped from Agatha before she could stuff it down, her eyes flying to the intern’s blushing cheeks. It would have been funny if he’d said it to be funny. Saying it offhand was so so so much better.</p><p>Jen looked appalled.</p><p>“Aren’t you a child?”</p><p>The intern sighed helplessly.</p><p>“I’m twenty!”</p><p>Jen gave him a once over, face still twisted in shock.</p><p>“Still. I’m telling Lilia no nut allergies.”</p><p>Agatha puckered her lips but it didn’t stop her laugh.</p><p>“No nut.”</p><p>The intern’s face burned brighter and Jen groaned loudly as she walked away, calling out behind her.</p><p>“Dinner in twenty! Don’t go anywhere or Lilia will leave sardines in your beds. Her threat, not mine.”</p><p>Agatha stood to leave.</p><p>“That’s my que.”</p><p>“For what?”</p><p>Agatha straightened out her incredibly wrinkled outfit.</p><p>“To hide. Enjoy family dinner.”</p><p>The intern looked startled.</p><p>“What about the sardines?”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“Our rooms are locked for security reasons.”</p><p>She saw movement before she heard Wanda’s steps.</p><p>Wanda walked into the living room alone— to Agatha’s relief.</p><p>“I can give her access.”</p><p>Agatha feigned a smile. She was feeling overwhelmed and she would either find a way to escape or she’d make it everyone else’s problem.</p><p>“Looks like we’re all willing to break the rules.”</p><p>Instead of raising to the bait, Wanda tilted her head.</p><p>“Agatha, can I speak with you?”</p><p>Agatha felt a thud of dread in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>“You’re framing it like a question but I don’t feel like I can say no.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Please stop making things so difficult.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, head falling back dramatically. She touched the interns shoulder as she walked toward Wanda.</p><p>“Nobody lets you have fun when you’re old. Keep that in mind.”</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>“I think you find your ways.”</p><p>Agatha winked back.</p><p>“True.” She breezed past Wanda into the hall. “Where do you want me, boss?”</p><p>Wanda motioned toward the front door.</p><p>“It will only take a moment.”</p><p>Agatha followed her outside, past the two security officers, and to the far side of the little yard where an old fountain sat broken and unused. There was a bench but Wanda didn’t assume to sit.</p><p>Agatha looked around them, her anxiety jumping.</p><p>“You have a secret to tell me?”</p><p>Wanda shook her head.</p><p>“No, Agatha, I wanted to talk about the case. About us working together.”</p><p>It felt like a strange kind of pity and Agatha’s skin crawled.</p><p>“Don’t bother, Wanda. I’ll make sure my penance looks really sincere.”</p><p>Wanda reached out and gripped Agatha’s arm, her eyes soft.</p><p>“No, I believe I made the point I needed to make.” Wanda released her, twisting her hand dismissively. “Ultimately, it got us to the next mile marker and I’m not going to sit here and pretend it didn’t.” She held up a finger. “<i>Not</i> that I want you doing it again. We got lucky.”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“I was smart. There was nothing to get lucky about.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Agatha, you made an educated guess– no, you played on a hunch– and happened to be right. If the new owner had been on the up and up, this situation would look very, very different.”</p><p>Agatha fidgeted with her fingers trying to ground herself. From the moment she’d found Rio in her room she felt as if she was having an out of body experience.</p><p>“We were wasting so much time, Wanda.”</p><p>“I know. Can you meet me halfway here? You found the doctored footage. If you had given me that information I could have put pressure where it was needed to get us on track. If you had spoken to me before making your calls, I could have pushed for a visit to Crete or gone over the Captain’s head. There were other options than you running off half-cocked.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“I’ve never done anything with a cock.”</p><p>“Shut up, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and looked away, her eyes finding anything to look at besides Wanda. This heart to heart was a little too much to top off the day. She stared at the empty bird feeder with peeling, blue paint and rusting metal lacework.</p><p>“What happened to your neck?”</p><p>Agatha’s chest iced over, her lungs freezing, her body stilling. She remembered Rio’s nails digging into the skin of her neck, her shoulders, her back.</p><p>“I–” She didn’t know what to say. A bird tried to carry her off? The intern swung at her with a fireplace poker? She continued to fidget, her thumb and forefinger twisting around her finger. She pursed her lips. “I made the mistake of playing with a feral cat.”</p><p>It was silent for long enough that Agatha had to look. She found Wanda staring intently at the movement of her hands and only then realized what she was doing. It had been a habit before, when she still wore her ring, a slow, soothing twist of warm metal over skin. Agatha stilled, her hands falling to her sides as she watched whatever pieces of the puzzle Wanda had placed on her board start to lock in place.</p><p>Wanda’s head shot up.</p><p>“Oh my god, did you guys <i>fuck</i>?!”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot wide, her hand slapping over Wanda’s mouth like they were still in high school.</p><p>“Shut the fuck up, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda stared– agape– her mind buzzing through possibilities.</p><p>“You really did a number on her lip–”</p><p>Agatha held out a hand.</p><p>“If you don’t stop talking I’m going to shoot you.”</p><p>Wanda spoke softer, her shock turning to concern.</p><p>“She did not seem happy when she left.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“Nobody is happy. It was a mistake.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression fell.</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, her guilt crashing back into her and turning her words bitter and harsh.</p><p>“Listen, we’re not friends, Maximoff. You’re my boss. I’m the fuck-up on your team that also happens to be staying in your guesthouse. Don’t get confused.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t flinch at the force of the words. She took a step back.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Agatha. I shouldn’t have pried.” She moved to pass Agatha but slowed at her shoulder. “But you’re wrong. I’ll be here when you’re ready to talk about it.” She called back as she walked to the house. “You’re not getting out of dinner. I’ll see you inside.”</p><p>____________</p><p>Dinner was a strange affair. Agatha had poured herself a heavy glass of wine and finished it within minutes as they all gathered at the round, wooden table in the kitchen. Chairs scraped on hardwood floors and there was a round of ceramic clinks as Jen and Lilia placed dishes in the center of the table. The intern had waxed poetic about the food like he’d never eaten a meal in his life and Alice and Wanda thanked them graciously.</p><p>Agatha had drank.</p><p>The food was undeniably good. A penne pasta with tomato sauce, sauteed and sliced eggplant, ricotta salata, basil, and pine nuts as the main dish. They’d added sides of mixed green salad and marinated olives and artichokes. Agatha ate as much as possible to ensure her mouth was always filled with food or wine so the popcorned questions were never turned toward her.</p><p>By the time she’d finished half of her plate she was on her way past a healthy buzz.</p><p>It was jarring. So many faces of people she hardly knew, that hardly knew each other, sitting around and talking like they cared. It felt uncomfortably warm, achingly happy. It was the kind of space she couldn’t relax in.</p><p>Lilia had kept pace with Agatha’s wine intake but her flushed cheeks fed into the open joy she was showing. She laughed loudly at Jen—absurd—her eyes watering as she patted the table.</p><p>“There’s no way!”</p><p>Jen nodded repeatedly, her lips pulled into a grin.</p><p>“I literally delivered this woman’s baby after being shot by her husband. He was handcuffed, screaming from the bathroom, and my partner at the time had belted a brand new stuffed animal against the bullet wound in my calf to stop the bleeding.”</p><p>Wanda was chuckling along, her head tilting to look down at Jen’s leg.</p><p>“How long were you waiting for help?”</p><p>Jen sighed, her smile softening a bit.</p><p>“Thirty minutes. The most stressful minutes of my entire life.”</p><p>The intern seemed deeply shocked, his face held in his hands as he listened.</p><p>“It sounds like a movie script.”</p><p>Jen laughed.</p><p>“Wait until you hear the husband's profession.” She paused for dramatic effect, then, “Obstetrician.”</p><p>There was a collective wail of laughter and Jen seemed to soften before Agatha’s eyes as she looked around the table in quiet awe.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her plate and shoveled a stack of leaves into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha heard the front door and tensed just as Jen directed a question at her.</p><p>“What about you, Agatha? Craziest scar?”</p><p>Agatha looked up as two figures stepped into the room.</p><p>Sharon shuffled quickly to the open chair by Alice and sat down.</p><p>“Oh my god, what a lovely meal. Lilia, you’re a saint.” She picked up the bottle in front of her. “Wine! Goody.”</p><p>Rio looked like marble, her lines carved to perfection. She smiled at the gathered group like her face hadn’t been painted with salt and makeup hours before. Like she hadn't been panting, riding Agatha's fingers.</p><p>Agatha felt her approach like an executioner as Rio walked to the only remaining spot available.</p><p>She hadn’t expected this. Hadn’t expected Rio to push back. She gave Jen her full attention knowing that it had already been too long without an answer.</p><p>“I have a few.”</p><p>The intern leaned forward eagerly and Agatha felt nauseous as all eyes fell on her sitting next to Rio. Wanda looked particularly interested and Agatha wished magic were real so she could disappear.</p><p>Rio’s tone was goading.</p><p>“Don’t leave us hanging, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, turning slightly in her chair so she could reveal the long scar at the back of her elbow.</p><p>“Knitting needle.” The memory of it brought an unbidden smile to her lips. “There was an extremist group, Daughters of Liberty. They were hellbent on bringing women back to their proper places in society and in the home. I know, the name doesn’t make sense.” She fought the urge to look at Rio. “My partner at the time was one of those guys that wasn’t overtly a piece of shit but he hadn’t seen the women as a credible threat.</p><p>“We’d been placed on a task force meant to clear what was falsely reported as a storage facility. It had felt strange from the jump but it was early in my career and my voice didn’t hold the weight it needed to. These women had left an array of honest-to-god booby traps on every floor of this building. My partner had seen a trip-wire and laughed, made a comment about the opacity as he stepped over and had promptly landed on a pressure plate.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I reached out and yanked him back by his neck and got a great souvenir. They’d sharpened the needles and stuck them in an air-pressured PVC pipe.”</p><p>The intern looked enthralled.</p><p>“Did he apologize?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“No. He wrote in his report that I gave him whiplash. Thank fuck for bodycams.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled.</p><p>“I remember him. Ralph, right? You named every single one of our volleyball teams after him.”</p><p>Agatha grinned because that had likely been the sweetest revenge of her life.</p><p>“When you act like a dick and have a surname like Bohner, things aren’t going to pan out.”</p><p>A round of laughter surrounded her and Agatha noticed the warmth of the room beginning to seep into her chest. She chafed against it.</p><p>To her surprise, Rio spoke from beside her. She hadn’t touched the food on her plate and she was sitting rather relaxed against the back of her chair.</p><p>“I’ve got a scar.”</p><p>Agatha knew every single one. The puckered circle from a gunshot in the back of her shoulder, the jagged crescent on her ribcage from being thrown into a crushed, steel drum, the one on her forearm from the compound fractured she’d gotten as a kid in a hellish foster home. Rio was littered with stories and memories written across the panes of her skin.</p><p>Agatha’s mind careened back into her room, back into the pained, ragged break in time when she’d run her hands across Rio’s neck and jaw and scalp.</p><p>Rio chuckled.</p><p>“It’s actually from my eighth week at Quantico.”</p><p>Agatha stilled. She wouldn't.</p><p>But Rio seemed inclined, her elbows resting on the table very close to Agatha’s silverware.</p><p>Agatha would just need a quick flash to grab the knife and jam it in her arm. She’d create a new scar for Rio to talk about. Instead, she gripped the edge of the table.</p><p>“We were in the Hogan’s Alley training facility and the simulation was a bank robbery turned car chase.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched and she felt Wanda’s eyes on her.</p><p>“I was paired up with another agent and we were told to give chase. I was the driver, she was the passenger.” Rio laughed. “At some point in the chase, I was meant to complete a J-Turn and continue the pursuit. My companion saw a different opportunity.</p><p>“At the very start of the turn, she flung herself out of the car and rolled, firing two rubber-tipped rounds into the tire of the fleeing vehicle. In an effort not to drive a three thousand pound car over her, I had to yank the wheel the opposite direction. I ended up running straight into the side of the closest building and getting absolutely covered by pieces of the windshield. Getting hit at 220 by an airbag while you’re covered in shards of glass isn’t entirely pleasant,” Rio tilted her head to reveal the razor-thin scar that started at the bottom of her chin and trailed down to the start of her throat. “I fell out of that car covered in my own blood and all training was called off for the day.”</p><p>There were various looks of amused horror at the table and Agatha tried to keep her face free of any emotion.</p><p>The intern leaned forward.</p><p>“What happened to the agent?”</p><p>Rio grinned, Agatha could see the sly little smirk from the corner of her eye and she prepared for the reveal.</p><p>“She was in a lot of trouble until I said I’d been in on it. I told them I’d fucked up, not her. Instead of probation, both of us clocked the fastest time to complete. She became one of the most accomplished agents from our class.”</p><p>Jen huffed.</p><p>“She sounds like a lunatic.”</p><p>Rio laughed.</p><p>“Oh, she was.”</p><p>Agatha saw Alice’s head turn to her, her eyes narrowed in thought as she glanced between Agatha and Rio.</p><p>Agatha felt like she was walking a tightrope made of thorns coated in battery acid. She was torn between crashing her finished plate over Rio’s head and making a run for it.</p><p>Wanda saw it too and intervened.</p><p>“A record that I beat the next week.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>“We made the blueprint.”</p><p>Wanda pushed her plate away from her and chuckled.</p><p>“Semantics.” She gave Rio a near-reproachful look and turned to the rest of the group. “Lilia, Jen, thank you for the meal. This was really lovely. I’m going to show our Director to her room and then I’ll be happy to do clean-up.”</p><p>Nobody made a comment about the fact that Rio had barely eaten as she stood, her napkin set on her empty plate.</p><p>“Of course, thank you. This was lovely.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence as they left the room and it continued until their footsteps were heard on the second floor.</p><p>Then Jen was leaning forward conspiratorially.</p><p>“Do you think they fucked? You know, when they were in training together?”</p><p>Agatha was so struck by the statement that she nearly choked on the eggplant in her mouth. Sharon gasped, the intern went red, and Lilia wagged her finger.</p><p>“That is so crass, Jennifer.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes, head shaking.</p><p>“Oh please, you <i>know</i> what Quantico is like. It’s so high stress and you’re on base for weeks without much outer-world contact. You’re telling me you didn’t sleep with a bunch of your fellow agents in training?”</p><p>Lilia huffed.</p><p>“I didn’t say that. Who doesn’t?”</p><p>Jennifer pointed.</p><p>“Exactly. It’s a fair question. Do you think they fucked?”</p><p>Agatha drank four large gulps of her wine as the intern of all people pitched in.</p><p>“I did a lot of research on the WFO before I joined. And I’ve talked to a lot of agents that have been there a while. I’m pretty sure the Director was married at one point.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to puke.</p><p>Alice frowned at the intern.</p><p>“Why do you say that?”</p><p>He touched his sternum.</p><p>“The necklace she wears.”</p><p>Alice frowned.</p><p>“The knife-looking thing?”</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“No, she has two chains. Once I was at the WFO early to try out their gym and she was there. She was getting into the sparring ring with a Senior Agent and she took both off. The other looked like a ring.”</p><p>Agatha felt her heart shifting, breaking and grinding like tectonic plates in her chest.</p><p>Jennifer shrugged.</p><p>“Could’ve been. Although that doesn't negate my previous question." She pursed her lips. "It’s hard to keep a relationship in a job like ours.” She motioned around them. “Look at us. We’ve been here for almost a month. That’s always going to strain a relationship.”</p><p>Lilia pitched it with a lazy, drunken guffaw.</p><p>“My first and second marriages were not successful for that very reason. And also because they were jealous pricks.”</p><p>The blanket of booze brought out a ring of laughter and the conversation turned easily to Lilia’s first husband.</p><p>Agatha took that as her opportunity to stand.</p><p>“Well, this has been a pleasure, but I think it’s time for me to sleep.”</p><p>She carried her plate to the sink and rinsed it quickly. She did not offer to help clean as she headed for the hallway to a chorus of ‘goodnights.’</p><p>Agatha took the steps two at a time, stumbling near the top as the wine sloshed sickly in her stomach.</p><p>Rio wore her ring? Even now? Agatha’s head was spinning and she felt herself slipping back into her memory without resistance.</p><p>
<i>Rio’s fingers stroked at the soft skin of Agatha’s hip, her eyes lidded with alcohol and the lateness of the night. Agatha’s legs were on either side of Rio’s waist as she knelt astride her, their conversation giggled and mumbled between long sips of cheap beer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rested the bottom of her bottle on Rio’s stomach where her shirt had ridden up and Rio hissed at the cold.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Did you see that Bohner proposed to his girlfriend?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes rolled back as she laughed, her throat bared to Agatha’s hands if she were so inclined to place them there.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I can’t believe she said yes. Do you think he’ll take her last name?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha feigned shock, her hand resting on Rio’s chest instead as she took another sip.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“And lose his greatest chance at a legacy?” She watched the way the lamp light glittered in Rio’s eyes. “He wouldn’t dare.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio laughed and tried to find a way to drink, shifting and twisting under Agatha before collapsing back and whining drunkenly:</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m dying of thirst.” She tossed her head dramatically, the back of her hand pressed to her forehead. “It has been a pleasure knowing you. I bequeath to you my entire record collection and the pile of dirty socks in our hamper that you refuse to wash.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha cackled, her heart brilliant and alive and filled with a joy she had only ever found with Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I missed them <i>one</i> time!” She finished her beer and set it to the side before taking Rio’s. “Open your fucking mouth, I’m going to quench your thirst.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She started to tilt the beer over Rio’s head as Rio nearly screeched, her hand coming up to block it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Unhand me!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The struggle that followed was sloppy and filled with tired laughter. It ended as the beer dropped to the floor and rolled a trail of amber across the shitty carpet in their living room.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha collapsed onto Rio’s chest and burrowed into her neck as she continued to laugh. Rio’s arms wrapped around her, her own amusement quieting as they sank into one another.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Minutes later, Agatha mumbled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I bet Ralph got his girlfriend a heart-cut diamond.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio hummed her agreement.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ve always liked the men’s rings more.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded, her lips pressing a kiss into Rio’s jaw.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think I do too. They’re not in the way. They don’t cripple your finances for years, they’re stronger.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was silent for several seconds, her hands drawing slow patterns on Agatha’s back. Her voice came out softly, hesitant.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Would you marry me? If I asked, I mean?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The words didn’t scare Agatha. She didn’t sully the question with a joke. She was hopelessly, desperately in love with the woman below her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“In any lifetime.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip to draw herself back from her delirious stupor. She wiped the tears on her cheeks with a heavy-handed palm and walked to her door to lean against it.</p><p>Her hands were shaking, uncoordinated as she tried to unlock it. She looked down, felt the pull of the fresh scabs on her neck, and felt a scream boiling in her chest.</p><p>With forced focus, Agatha shoved her key in the lock and let herself inside. She breathed heavily, resting against the wall, before stumbling toward the bed.</p><p>Agatha drew to a sharp halt as she took in the bright red Hyacinth sitting in the center of her comforter.</p>

<p>Agatha rubbed her temples in irritation, her eyes closed to block out her own image reflecting back at her as she waited for Dr. Alder. She’d put off the session for as long as she could for the past week, claiming complications with the case. Alder had accepted her excuses until just an hour prior when she had sent Agatha a Zoom link with no other message.</p><p>Agatha had taken one of the private meeting rooms at the ROC and was waiting for it to connect.</p><p>The past week had been complex.</p><p>To her surprise and the surprise of the team, Alice and her had been kept on the case. Apparently, Sharon and Rio had developed and profferred a written disciplinary plan with an addendum that they remain on the case. The Chief of Police had accepted with minor amendments.</p><p>Agatha had not been privy to what the document contained, but to be allowed to remain, she was certain she wouldn’t like it. They’d been able to track the Porsche to a shipping magnate named Alessandro Veridi. He had few knocks on his record, likely due to his influence in politics and local law enforcement. Inspections on his vessels had come back sparkly and clean for the past ten years; far too clean.</p><p>By the time they had his name, Veridi had disappeared with whatever evidence connected him to their victim, likely warned by the Captain before his arrest.</p><p>But Agatha had a feeling that the remainder of the case, in some ways, was inevitable. The only malleable factor beyond the depth of Veridi’s involvement and how long he spent in prison would be whether or not Georgina had been disposed of to eliminate loose ends.</p><p>Agatha groaned. She needed this to be over.</p><p>After her moronic behavior with Rio, Agatha had been <i>distracted</i>. Rio hadn’t returned to DC when Sharon had left. She’d said it was to facilitate diplomacy— whatever the fuck that meant— and to ensure compliance.</p><p>Agatha might have believed those to be the only reasons if Rio hadn’t become painfully impossible. She was suddenly everywhere, always.</p><p>If Agatha was pouring herself a coffee, Rio would flit into the room like an obnoxious little wasp and treat her like a troublesome subordinate. <i>”Good morning, Agent Harkness. Plan to break any laws today?”</i></p><p>At one point, Agatha had attempted to search through the HPD database in an effort to locate Veridi’s leverage-able connections. She’d found her access blocked.</p><p>In approaching Wanda, she was given a bemused frown and told to check with the Director.</p><p>Agatha had been forced to hunt down Rio, who had been provided a personal space to work. The conversation had gone as expected.</p><p>
<i>”Why am I locked out of the system?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes lifted to her with a distinct lack of consideration, her mask firmly in place.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agent Harkness. I believe knocking would be appropriate for any future visits.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s hands curled into fists and she placed them behind her back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Cut the shit. Why don’t I have access?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio returned her attention to her computer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You have clearly shown a lack of self-control since arriving here in Athens. I’ve witnessed it personally. Until I believe you are capable of following orders, I am expecting you to keep me in the loop of your specific pursuits.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha breathed through her clenched teeth. She was aware that Wu was expected to do something similar and, on paper, nothing was amiss. But she knew every form of Rio <i>fucking</i> Vidal. From her unwavering dedication to her vicious, scheming mind, Agatha had experienced it all.</p><p>Rio’s tells were in the simmering lights in her eyes, the subtle lilts and emphasis in her words, the harsher lines of her suits and composure. Her button-downs were no longer rolled at the elbows, her jackets never came off, every wrinkle had been ironed out. Agatha hated it.</p><p>Rio had never been made for clean lines. She wasn’t meant to be buttoned up and tucked away. It had been a daily ritual when they were married. Rio would fasten the buttons on her shirt, perfect herself in front of their bathroom mirror, and Agatha would undo the top two, sometimes three if she could get away with it.</p><p>Rio would smirk or laugh or roll her eyes like she was surprised.</p><p>Agatha groaned and pressed her palms into her eyes. What a fucking bitch.</p><p>“I was waiting for you to finish your internal struggle but I think it might last for the entirety of the session.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her hands and blinked at Dr. Alder’s icy blue eyes staring back at her. She wasn’t sure what to say and so she said nothing.</p><p>Alder smirked.</p><p>“Ah, okay. Why don’t you start by telling me what happened.”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“A lot of things happened. Do you want the list?”</p><p>“No. I want to hear what caused you to postpone our session for an entire week.”</p><p>If Agatha was capable of pouting, she’d expect that was the face she made then.</p><p>“I’m not ready to talk about it.”</p><p>Alder had the audacity to chuckle.</p><p>“I may insist as I believe you are. You are wearing it quite plainly on your face.”</p><p>Agatha was so tired. She dropped her chin onto one hand and looked over the computer screen to stare at the blank wall.</p><p>“I fucked my ex.”</p><p>To her credit, Alder’s brows only slightly raised.</p><p>“That is a development.” She studied Agatha’s face. “Am I getting that you did not mean it?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“I barely thought it. I feel so— so helpless with the way she talks to me.”</p><p>“How does she talk to you?” When Agatha didn’t answer, Alder tilted her head. “Like she cares?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, her fingers twisting together.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Dr. Alder hummed.</p><p>“It seems like you struggle when anyone shows care for you. Have you considered why that is?”</p><p>“I generally try not to consider anything.”</p><p>Alder pursed her lips.</p><p>“We’ll disregard that non-answer. I’m going to ask you a question and I’d like an honest answer. Even if that answer is a yes or a no.” She paused then, “Do you feel guilty when they care?”</p><p>If one could be punched in the heart, Agatha imagined this is what it would feel like.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Alder took down notes before lifting her notebook and flipping back several pages.</p><p>“When we did your intake you said you were not experiencing any suicidal ideation. Is that still the case?”</p><p>Agatha shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>“Yes? I mean, I make jokes, but even in some of my more… terrible moments, I never thought I would kill myself.” She tilted her head back and forth. “I would have been okay dying, maybe. But never by my own hand.”</p><p>Alder flipped her pages back.</p><p>“Why do you think you feel guilt when others show you how they care?”</p><p>Agatha tossed out a hand.</p><p>“I don’t fucking know! What does any of this have to do with anything!”</p><p>“Lower your voice, Agatha. Think. Answer as best you can.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to be difficult. She wanted to plead the fifth like she’d done so many times before. But the weight of the ache crushing her chest and ravaging her head were becoming rather untenable. If she could just get some relief…</p><p>“I just don’t understand.”</p><p>“Understand what?”</p><p>Agatha thought about the efforts she’d gone through to distance herself. She’d left, for fucks sake. She’d ignored texts and calls and letters and the one or two or three times people had actually shown up. She’d been a vicious, unforgivable cunt.</p><p>“They won’t just give up!” It sounded pathetic, a waver in her voice as it gave out at the end. She sucked in a breath. “Have some fucking self-respect. Stop trying. Stop thinking things can go back to the way they were before, that I can be the person I was before.” She felt her rage and grasped for it. “It’s embarrassing to watch them grovel.”</p><p>Alder scribbled in her notebook and every scratch stoked Agatha’s anger. She dug her nails into her palm.</p><p>Alder looked up and seemed pleased.</p><p>“You’re an asshole because you think they’re pathetic for caring?”</p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p>“I hate everything you’re saying to me.”</p><p>“You don’t like that we’re looking past your defense mechanism.” Alder tapped on her notebook. “I am going to say something that will hurt you. It will make you angry.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed out a laugh but her anxiety peaked.</p><p>“What if you didn’t do that?”</p><p>Alder grinned.</p><p>“I’m going to do it. You deserve the truth even if you don’t want it.” Alder paused, then, “People loving you through difficulty is a strength. It speaks to their character. With what you’ve told me about your behavior, they would have every right to step back even though your actions are born of grief, of unhealed trauma. It’s impressive they have stayed this long. It doesn’t mean they will stay forever.” Alder held out a hand to halt Agatha’s interruption. “You may claim to want that, fine.” She shrugged. “Then do the work. Do the healing. Tell them you have no interest in maintaining your connection. Leave.”</p><p>Agatha’s rebuttals died out at the thought of, after everything, leaving again. She stared at Alder and said nothing. Every word felt like the slow slide of a dull blade through her skin and between her ribs.</p><p>Alder finished driving the knife in.</p><p>“Something has to give, Agatha. The manic, destructive way you are existing in the world is not sustainable. The suffering you’re inflicting on the people around you, on yourself, it will write its own ending if you don’t take control.”</p><p>Alder was right. Agatha was angry. The words hurt. They clawed and ripped and pried until she was bare and bleeding. She could hardly swallow the lump in her throat. Her eyes were blurred by a thin film of tears.</p><p>“I don’t know how.”</p><p>Alder offered a gentle smile.</p><p>“That’s what we’re here for. When I told you that you had to want your own healing, I didn’t just mean I needed you to show up to our sessions and bare your soul. This is a single step up an incredibly steep incline. Stop pushing away the people that are offering you a hand.”</p><p>Agatha sniffed, her throat clearing. Fear clung to her ribs and begged her to bite. She pushed through.</p><p>“I’m—“ She nearly bit through her tongue. “What if it doesn’t work? What if I lose more?”</p><p>Alder raised her brows.</p><p>“What else do you have to lose now? Can you honestly tell me that the love you’ve had in your life wasn’t worth it? That you would change a single thing if you knew what would come after?”</p><p>Agatha felt the answer in the enamel of her teeth, the muscles of her jaw, the press of her tongue on the roof of her mouth.</p><p>“No.” She started to tap her heel into the floor. “But I’m not the same. I can’t be the same. She doesn’t exist.”</p><p>“Who? You talk about yourself like you died, Agatha. It may have felt like that, it might still feel like that. But you are right here. You are alive and you are just as capable and worthy of love now as you were before.”</p><p>It rang false, but Agatha didn’t want Alder to think she was being difficult.</p><p>“I’m not— it’s not like—“ She shook her head. “<i>How?</i> How is it possible that who I’ve become deserves their patience? Deserves their empathy?”</p><p>Dr. Alder shrugged.</p><p>“Our worst moments don’t define us. We make mistakes. Our greatest harms are often inflicted on those we care about the most. It’s a human condition.”</p><p>“I’m going to fuck up so much.”</p><p>Alder laughed. Too loudly if Agatha was allowed to have that opinion.</p><p>“Oh god, of course you are. Everyone does. It’s unfortunate that your reflex to conflict is so pointed, but edges can be dulled.” Alder pulled her computer closer and began to type. “I’m going to send you a document. I want you to go through it at the end of every day. If you notice a pattern, write it down and bring it to our next session.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“Homework seems a bit excessive.”</p><p>Alder pushed her laptop back after sending.</p><p>“I can add more if you’d like something to complain about.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms over her chest feeling like a kid in the principle’s office.</p><p>“That’s not necessary.”</p><p>Alder smirked.</p><p>“Great.” She sobered and gave Agatha a serious look. “Don’t beat yourself up when your defenses come out. Just because they’ve grown teeth doesn’t mean that their original purpose wasn’t good. You have every right to protect yourself, just not from everything. If you bite, recognize it and do better the next time.”</p><p>Agatha felt the buzz in her pocket, likely Alder’s email.</p><p>“Sure. Yeah. Okay. Are we done?”</p><p>Alder made a point of looking at her watch.</p><p>“We still have twelve minutes. I’d like you to tell me what you plan to do about Rio.”</p><p>____________</p><p> </p><p>
<i>”Try not to feed into any kind of competition. If you want to pursue her, you have to do it the right way. If you need to walk away, she deserves to know that.”</i>
</p><p>Easier said than done. She and Rio had never done anything <i>the right way</i>. They’d never been good at taking things slow or thinking through their actions. From Agatha’s first introduction to the woman, she had been enthralled. She’d launched herself out of a moving car without thought to impress her for Christ’s sake.</p><p>Rio had taken a risk to defend her after Agatha had nearly broken her perfect face. And that was before they’d even held a full conversation.</p><p>They had never existed in spaces of half-effort. Agatha shook her head and stood, folding her laptop in her arms.</p><p>What happened with Rio was like breathing. It happened without thought, without awareness, until something changed. Until easy breathing turned into a gasp or a sob or a silence so enduring it felt like death. Trying to make herself aware, trying to control it… it felt wrong.</p><p>Agatha could give a little leeway to Wanda. Maybe. The team. If the timing lined up.</p><p>She stepped from the room and walked back toward the command center with a gnawing pit in her stomach.</p><p>The intern waved at her as soon as she entered.</p><p>“I’m sorting through Alessandro Veridi’s property records. We’ve pinpointed several possible locations of interest that might be large enough to operate out of.”</p><p>Okay. She could be less of a bitch. Totally.</p><p>“Well done, William.”</p><p>Five sets of eyes fell to her at once, shock and confusion swarming her. Agatha nearly vomited.</p><p>She waited for anyone to say something to break the deeply awkward silence in the room. She sat in deep embarrassment until she was forced to do it herself. She snapped, giving him a look.</p><p>“Are you going to read me in or stare like a trout? Fish don’t have a lot of qualities that make a good agent.”</p><p>He blinked as the rest of the team began to relax.</p><p>“Um, sorry, yes!”</p><p>He began to walk her through what he’d found and Agatha tried to listen through her incredibly loud discomfort. Being kind was overrated.</p><p>____________</p><p>Rio sat before the team in her perfectly buttoned dress shirt and Agatha had to force her gaze away from the collar. It looked suffocating,</p><p>Wanda nodded toward the intern.</p><p>“William, please.”</p><p>He stood, his eyes eager as he pulled up an image of the first location. It was an overhead of a large industrial building set against the water. Three docks protruded from it.</p><p>“This is a small dock that belongs to Veridi. It’s our highest point of interest due to the easy means of transportation and general isolation. It’s not one of his company’s shipyards and it is marked for personal use. The closest building is four miles away and it’s a holiday home. The owners spend most of the year traveling.”</p><p>He flipped to the next image. A side view of a partially constructed building with metal siding and exposed beams.</p><p>“This is a plot of land Veridi purchased four years ago with the intention of putting in a sports facility. Building was started and never completed so it’s sitting as mostly a frame with sections of outer wall completed.”</p><p>The intern moved to the next, a building with large windows and red panels that mimicked a barn.</p><p>“This is a location on-site of Veridi’s house. It’s a barn-type structure—“</p><p>Agatha interrupted.</p><p>“It’s not going to be his private shed.”</p><p>Wanda gave her a look.</p><p>“Why don’t we finish the briefing before we offer rebuttals.”</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“It’s a waste of time. He’s not going to commit crimes on his own property.”</p><p>Lilia shrugged.</p><p>“I’d have to agree. He’s in this position because he’s smart.”</p><p>The intern pulled up several documents with strings of numbers and codes.</p><p>“There’s an exorbitant amount of electricity funneling into the secondary structure.”</p><p>Agatha waved it off.</p><p>“He’s a wealthy bastard. Think of any other reason he might want a separate space from his wife and family? Work? An at-home theater? A place to take his affair partners?”</p><p>Rio interrupted cooly.</p><p>“Forgive me if I’m not willing to rely on your hunches when making calls on the remainder of this case, Agent Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha met her head-on, jaw tight. She could have used Lilia’s backing to push her point. She did not.</p><p>“Maybe wear a tie if you’re going to have such a long stick up your ass.”</p><p>Rio’s dark eyes narrowed slightly and Agatha could see Wanda press her forehead into her palm. The remainder of the team held their breath.</p><p>Rio looked at the intern, completely disregarding Agatha’s comment.</p><p>“Please, continue.”</p><p>He did, pushing through the thick tension in the room, his gaze flicking toward Agatha and Rio intermittently.</p><p>He explained their findings, the puzzle-work that had revealed the why behind each location and the easiest access points for an infiltration team.</p><p>Throughout, Agatha kept her eyes on the blank desk in front of her. Her hands were clammy where they were clenched on her thighs. Every time she looked up she kept finding the crisp lines of Rio’s collar, the way it covered too much of her throat. She was going crazy. That had to be it. There was no other reason her fingers would itch to act on such an absurd compulsion.</p><p>She didn’t listen to the follow-up questions Rio presented, nor did she take any notes on the list of details Rio wanted hammered down before they delivered this information to the HPD.</p><p>Their newly appointed team had been working on Veridi’s financial records in a separate space to keep the peace.</p><p>She was so stuck in her thoughts that Rio’s next words were jarring.</p><p>“Agent Harkness, a word.”</p><p>Agatha looked up and met Wanda’s tired expression. She blinked, looked to Rio.</p><p>“Just one?”</p><p>Rio’s head tilted in the direction of her temporary office and Agatha looked toward the exit of the ROC with longing. She stood and followed Rio from the command center with anticipation heavy on her tongue and curious eyes at her back.</p><p>They walked silently through a string of hallways but Rio stopped them before they reached anywhere that could be considered truly private. But nobody else was around them; it seems this hallway was rarely used. Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>Rio turned, her expression muted, but she easily moved a step too close.</p><p>“Agent Harkness, your suspension is still on the table.”</p><p>Agatha broiled. A echo of warning clanged in the back of her skull as she took the bait.</p><p>“Did a quick orgasm still your hand last time? I can provide my services again.”</p><p>To her disappointment, Rio offered a bland smile.</p><p>“That won’t be necessary.” She turned, started to walk away. “Please do keep in mind that your continued presence on this case is only at my permission.”</p><p>Agatha caught Rio’s arm without thought, her fingers curling tightly around the blazer and half-turning her. She stared at the way Rio’s jaw flexed, how Rio didn’t turn her head, how Rio’s eyes fell to the hand on her arm.</p><p>Agatha should have seen the threat, should have felt the walls closing in. Instead, she let her hand move without much thought, her fingers dipping into the groove of Rio’s collarbone to her throat. She brushed the sensitive skin before trailing to the plastic button at the top.</p><p>With deft movement, the memory in her muscles and tendons worked in tandem, Agatha undid the top button, then the second, her own chest raising and falling too quickly.</p><p>She moved to the third and Rio caught her hand like she always used to. Now, instead of a pleased laugh or a gentle shove of Agatha’s arm, Rio’s fingers locked around her wrist tight enough to sting. She met Agatha’s eyes with vicious triumph sitting in her expression.</p><p>“Watch yourself, Agent. Desperation isn’t always pretty.”</p><p>Agatha’s teeth ground tight. She was on her back foot now. She’d overstepped, showed too much, and Rio had been waiting for it.</p><p>She yanked her hand free of Rio’s grip. She turned to leave but stilled, not wanting to leave in this deficit of power. There were so many things clamoring to fall from her mouth, to cut and tear, and then Rio’s fingers grazed her spine.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, her eyes closed, and none of those words came out.</p><p>Rio’s fingers touched her hair, sending shivers through her. A second hand pressed against the back of Agatha’s ribs. Rio was the one to speak, arrogance laced in every word.</p><p>“I expect you’ve been ready for me for days.” Her voice carried that tone, the one that dragged Agatha’s mind into the pits of hell. Rio breathed in. “I expect if I were to touch you…” She let out in a heavy sigh, “you’d be dripping for me.”</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her mouth to remain silent. She was under no illusion that this was the start of a very dangerous romp at the ROC. Rio would give her nothing after Agatha’s power grab at the consulate house. Still, the thought of walking away before Rio got her point across wasn’t one she could entertain.</p><p>Rio’s fingers twisted strands of hair together, tugged lightly.</p><p>“I know if you touch yourself, it won’t be enough. I know that you’ll think of me when you try. You’ll hate me when you can’t quite get there.”</p><p>Agatha felt exposed, like every nerve in her body was at Rio’s command. She didn’t breathe. Her losing option would be to give in, to turn and let herself be picked apart. God, she wanted to.</p><p>Rio’s fingers sifted through Agatha’s hair, touched the nodules of her spine, then closed around the back of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“When you’re entirely out of options, when you’ve tried everything, you can call me. You can beg me.” She sunk her nails in. “You’ll find that you hate me even more when I give you exactly what you need.”</p><p>Rio released her and Agatha heard her footsteps fade.</p><p>She stood in the hallway for several moments so the harsh blush she knew to be on her cheeks would settle. She glanced around but, as expected, Rio had stopped them there for a reason. The single camera in sight looked to be under repair, its wires loose, the lense aimed at the floor.</p><p>Agatha sucked in lungfuls of air, shook her head, and made her way back toward the command center.</p><p>It was almost comical. It had been three hours since her conversation with Dr. Alder and she was sure that every action she’d taken had gone against the wise suggestions of her therapist.</p><p>She slowed as she neared the room, trying to ground herself. Her thighs were slick against one another, the tight coil of want in her belly pulsing in time with her rapid heartbeat. She pressed her head against the wall for a moment to cool down.</p><p>The problem, Agatha considered, was that Rio wasn’t wrong. Agatha had already tried twice to relieve the building pressure in her chest and between her thighs. It felt like a poor substitution, like she’d lost the ability to connect with her own body.</p><p>She tried to imagine what Rio would do to her if she could allow herself to stoop so low. The options were endless, consuming, and Agatha drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>She was so fucked.</p><p>____________</p><p> </p><p>It took two days to gather the information Rio had requested. Two days of being stuck in the same building with Rio’s words held over her head like an anvil. She hadn’t tried to touch herself again; a part of her certain that if she never attempted it, the need would dissipate.</p><p>It didn’t. Agatha was grumpy and irritable and she definitely hadn’t opened the worksheet Dr. Alder had sent her. How could she focus on her own patterns of toxic behavior when she was agonizing over the moment she gave in.</p><p>It was a foregone conclusion. No matter the efforts made in the coming days, weeks if she found some self-respect, Agatha would falter. She would summon the devil to give her relief and the devil would provide further torture.</p><p>Agatha fell asleep with an ache between her thighs, she dreamed of domineering hands, of harsh words, and she woke in the morning cursing Rio’s name in the mirror as she brushed her teeth.</p><p>Now that Rio had thrown the gauntlet, she seemed to have disappeared. She’d released her tight, controlling grip after placing the ball firmly in Agatha’s court, knowing Agatha wouldn’t be able to walk away.</p><p>Rio had given Wanda the task of monitoring Agatha’s use of the database. She no longer appeared just to ruffle Agatha’s feathers, she no longer walked around buttoned up with her crisp suit jackets sitting on her shoulders. She spent a significant amount of time in her office and left the case to Wanda and the team.</p><p>Near the end of the second day, Agatha was trying to focus on the case. She was twisting in her office chair, the seat rocking side to side as she dug through the organizations tied to Veridi’s private dock, noted persons of influence that might throw a wrench in their plans if they moved in. William was beside her, his thick brows furrowed in thought as he did the same for the half-crafted sports facility.</p><p>He nudged Agatha with his foot.</p><p>“What contractor did you say worked on the dock?”</p><p>She looked at his foot beside her calf and rolled her chair away, shooting him a look.</p><p>“For one, keep your dirty shoes off of my pants.” She shoved a document into his face. “Two, it was Viron Holdings.”</p><p>He rolled his eyes as he took the paper.</p><p>“You don’t have to pretend I’m annoying you. I bet you like working with me more than the rest of the team.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“I like that you’re too inexperienced to outshine me.”</p><p>William grinned as he looked idly through the file.</p><p>“Get ready to be blinded, then.” He leaned forward and set two separate work orders in front of her. “Viron Holdings was responsible for two of Veridi’s other projects.” He pointed at the first. “That’s the sports facility.” His finger shifted to the second. “That there is his ‘private shed,’ as you put it.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, looking over the documents. She chuckled.</p><p>“I bet if you looked a little further, you’d find Viron Holdings was hired for a good portion of his projects.” Agatha pushed the pages back toward him. “Not every similarity means there is correlation.”</p><p>His head tilted down, lips pulling into an embarrassed frown.</p><p>Agatha felt a twinge of something in her chest and tapped the table.</p><p>“If something in your gut is telling you that barn is important, the worst thing you can do is listen to somebody telling you it’s not. Even if that somebody is me.”</p><p>William offered a wry smile.</p><p>“You said it would be a waste of time.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“It could be. But you’ve got a lot of jaded people on this team and fresh eyes are always a good thing. The key to pursuing a flimsy lead is keeping it to yourself until you know you’re right. Until you have the proof and you can smash everyone’s faces in the proverbial cake.”</p><p>William laughed, his self-doubt erased, and the twinge in Agatha’s chest eased away.</p><p>“Is that what you did with the footage and the hotel?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and looked back to her own work.</p><p>“No. That’s the common lesson of asking for forgiveness, not permission.” Agatha offered him a wink. “And I don’t usually ask for either.”</p><p>He grinned and looked back down, expression turning to consternation.</p><p>“I don’t actually know where to start with my flimsy lead.”</p><p>Agatha turned toward him fully, kicking his legs so he spun away and had to right himself. She slumped in her chair and steepled her fingers across her stomach.</p><p>“What about the barn is setting off your instincts? Start there.”</p><p>He slumped to match her pose, even going so far as to mimic her hand placement.</p><p>“Okay.” He frowned. “It’s the type of building. Why shape it like a barn when you already have a building for storage in use on the property. Why not just create a second home?”</p><p>Agatha loved playing devil’s advocate.</p><p>“Personal taste? It’s noted that Veridi grew up on a farm. Touch of history.”</p><p>“Okay, but what about the security measures? We can’t access the full building plans, but we know that he used state of the art systems to secure it.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“Veridi has wealth. Why wouldn’t you protect what you own?”</p><p>William sighed as he shuffled through pages to find the image of the barn.</p><p>“I don’t know. Maybe it’s nothing. It’s just–” He stared at the page. “It feels wrong.”</p><p>Agatha reached over and took the picture, her eyes searching, studying.</p><p>William kept talking.</p><p>“The blueprints for the shed stated it was going to be two stories but they built it as one. Why?”</p><p>Agatha hummed.</p><p>“Changes are made in the midst of construction pretty regularly. Most projects aren't completed exactly as expected.”</p><p>“What about the windows? They’re reflective.” He paused and answered his own question with a sigh and a wave of his hand. “Could be anything. Privacy from the public, from his family. I get it.”</p><p>Agatha grunted her agreement to his self-rebuttal and narrowed her eyes, sitting up a little straighter. She pulled the image closer, eyes stuck on the odd blocks of cement that circled the barn.</p><p>“Well I’ll be fucking damned.”</p><p>William leaned forward.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha looked up and met his eyes with raised brows.</p><p>“Off the top of your head, why do you think barns don’t have basements?”</p><p>William’s head tilted in confusion.</p><p>“Stability? They’re pretty open structures.” He shrugged. “Usually they’re used for livestock. Anything needed is kept on the same floor or in the loft.”</p><p>Agatha pulled the file from his hands to sift through the construction plans. In the original two-story space, a massive pillar rose up from the center of it. It was rather unseemly but necessary to uphold a second floor. Agatha turned around the finalized blueprint so that it faced him.</p><p>“In the finished construction, they kept this support beam even though they decided against the second floor. Why?”</p><p>He deserved to put the pieces together himself.</p><p>William’s eyes widened, a brilliant smile appearing on his face.</p><p>“Because they didn’t change their plans. There are two floors.”</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“Bingo.” She set the picture of the finalized barn in front of William on the table. “Look.” She touched the concrete reinforcements spaced around the outside of the barn. “You saw these and it didn’t look right because, despite their commonality in most buildings, they aren’t needed for single-space structures.” Agatha crossed her arms, surprised nobody else had noticed the oddity. “That’s incredibly irritating.” She collected the evidence and held it all out toward William. “Go steal the spotlight.”</p><p>___</p><p>Agatha watched as William made his way across the large room to Wanda, his hands tight around the folders. She made a show of returning to her own task but kept her eyes on the interaction. William looked so proud and Wanda was clearly stoking that ego boost if her smile was anything to go by.</p><p>She was a good leader.</p><p>Agatha caught the easy compliment and frowned, trying to stomp it out before any more drifted into her mind.</p><p>Within the next hours, the rest of the team had been updated and a meeting was called for that night despite the lateness.</p><p>By nine-thirty, both the HPD and FBI were gathered in the command center to debrief and decide on next steps. The air was frosty with distrust but the Chief of Police for the HPD seemed to carry a deep respect from her subordinates.</p><p>Facts were presented by both teams and patched together over the span of multiple hours.</p><p>Apparently, Veridi’s shell-corporations, once found, had damning financial records with bribes and repeated sums of money pouring out toward political figures, members of the Hellenic Police Department, the Primary Regulatory Authority, the Port State Control, and multiple Classification Societies. It explained his spotless record and why he hadn’t been flagged in any system as a person with possible criminal intent.</p><p>Wanda presented their findings in return with multi-faceted breakdowns on the suspicious properties under Veridi’s name. She spent a significant amount of time fielding questions from the members of the HPD, many of which were efforts to throw doubt. Wanda maneuvered them with ease and Agatha chafed to give credence to Rio’s list of demands now panning out.</p><p>Creating a plan of action took longer than it should have and terse arguments cropped up from both sides. Currently, the new Major brought in to replace Daskalakis was pushing back against Jen’s suggestion that they place surveillance at each location.</p><p>“Risking alerting Veridi to our presence before we have legal right to infiltrate is foolish.”</p><p>Jen scoffed.</p><p>“Right, because a literal Captain of your department didn’t already sound that alarm? If we don’t get people on-site we risk far more.”</p><p>It was around this time that the Director decided to make her appearance. Agatha looked at the door before Rio walked through it, the hairs on her neck standing on end.</p><p>Rio was in a gray pantsuit and a black button-down sitting open at the collar like a taunt.</p><p>Agatha turned back toward the argument as Rio came inside and took a seat directly behind her.</p><p>Lilia had stepped in with a softer tone but her words were no less inciting of anger.</p><p>“We understand your privacy laws are strict. But there are legal methods to observe these locations without a warrant. The dock and facility are both businesses and they’re set within the eyesight of public roads. The only drawback is the house and we can comply with your laws while keeping somebody on-site.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as the Major dove into an in-depth explanation of Article 9 from their Constitution. She sat up, intent on interrupting, and felt a jolt at the back of her chair.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw snapped shut, her teeth making an audible click. It only solidified her conviction to stir the pot.</p><p>“If we needed to have a briefing on the Greek Articles, could you not have sent them in an email prior to this meeting? It’s nearly midnight.”</p><p>The Major’s eyes flickered over to her, mouth pulled in a hard line.</p><p>“It’s clear to everyone in this room that you are not equipped to be placed on such a sensitive case. There’s no need to prove the point further.”</p><p>Agatha pressed a hand to her chest, eyes taunting, voice lilting.</p><p>“You Majors are all the same. Is it a requirement of your position to be such a stuffy prick?”</p><p>The Chief of Police stepped in.</p><p>“That’s enough. Major Kostas, you are wasting time our victim does not have.” She looked to Rio, over Agatha’s shoulder. “Director, I know I don’t need to remind you about the decorum I expect from your Agents.”</p><p>Rio answered in kind.</p><p>“You do not. But I was assured, by you, that we would be able to continue this investigation in tandem with your people. It does seem that my team’s efforts are being delayed and thwarted by this new unit you’ve brought in.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence as the women stared at one another, their statuses clashing, standing firm.</p><p>The Chief of Police came to an executive conclusion.</p><p>“We will divide teams to ensure compliance with local ordinance. Major Kostas, you’ll pair with Agent Wu. Captain Ioannidis, with Agent Kale. Corporal Zervas, Senior Agent Maxifmoff and Agent Calderu. We’ll provide vehicles for the surveillance teams and Constables will be on call to provide immediate support.” Chief Koustou looked directly at Agatha. “Agent Harkness, you will remain here with your Director and me and provide tactical and operational oversight.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the challenge to the marrow of her bones. It was meant to draw out poor behavior, but she preferred to show that on her own terms. She stared back and said nothing at all despite the influx of emotions pattering drum beats on her chest. She could feel Rio’s presence at her back even as the attention in the room shifted toward logistics. She needed to expel some of this building energy before she did something drastic.</p><p>__________</p><p>They took two Embassy vehicles back to the consulate house around one-thirty in the morning and Agatha waited until Rio had climbed into the first to enter the second. She sat in silence as William and Alice spoke quietly to one another. She flexed her hands, then her arms. She rolled her shoulders and neck. She stretched out her legs.</p><p>Nothing helped the ache in her muscles.</p><p>As they walked into the consulate house, Jen commenting about needing a drink with a chorus of agreements to back her, Agatha peeled off toward her room. She closed herself inside and leaned against the door with a frustrated sigh, the pent-up irritation reaching a peak. She thought about Rio.</p><p>About the ease with which she could fix what Agatha was feeling if Agatha would only debase herself to ask.</p><p>Agatha dropped her head to her chest, stretching her neck so the healing marks made themselves known.</p><p>Feeling had always been Agatha’s flaw. She’d struggled to convert her emotions to something productive once they bypassed a certain threshold. Alder might say it was childhood trauma. Agatha would say it was an inconvenience that<br/>
Rio had always been able to work her through it.</p><p>She breathed and made the mistake of looking toward the wall where she’d fucked Rio.</p><p>“Fucking fuck fuck fuck.”</p><p>Agatha stormed toward her suitcase and kicked off her shoes. She tossed her slacks carelessly on the ground. Her sweater followed. With mindless focus, she threw on shorts and a t-shirt and stuffed her feet into her sneakers.</p><p>There was an exercise room in the house fitted with a treadmill but Agatha thought she might pass out if she didn’t leave. She couldn’t be in the same place as Rio when her body still remembered the best cure for its current state.</p><p>Agatha took the steps two at a time and almost crashed into Wanda as she reached the landing.</p><p>Wanda steadied her and frowned.</p><p>“Woah—“ she took in Agatha’s rather manic countenance and frowned. “Are you okay, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha stepped back. Wanda’s hands felt like too much. They were too soft and too careful.</p><p>“I’m going for a run.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t lecture her on the time or the fact that leaving the consulate house alone was against protocol. She didn’t ask any questions, only offering a quiet request.</p><p>“Wait outside for me. I’ll go change.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to shake her. She wanted to remind Wanda why her kindness was being wasted.</p><p>Instead, she offered a nod.</p><p>And she waited.</p><p>She slipped past the murmur of voices in the living room and stood in the cool night air, ignoring the looks of the two security officers at the entrance. She let the light breeze touch the fire in her lungs as she stretched her legs and back.</p><p>Wanda exited the house like she expected Agatha to be gone.</p><p>Her eyes fell to Agatha and she didn’t waste time joining her in the yard. She followed suit, swinging her arms back and across her chest.</p><p>“Are we sprinting or taking a scenic jog?”</p><p>Agatha worked the muscles in her calves, her eyes fixed on the front gate.</p><p>“I need it to hurt enough that I can sleep.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes softened but she didn’t push. They finished their warm-up in silence and Wanda followed as Agatha began to run.</p>

<p>Agatha heaved in breath after breath, her muscles screaming and her lungs strung out from being overworked for the four miles she and Wanda had covered.</p><p>Agatha’s steps were jelly, her body numb and weary in a way that gave her hope. She stumbled through the gate with Wanda behind her; she was not faring much better.</p><p>Agatha let herself tumble into the grass and roll onto her back. She stared up at the stars and lifted her hands above her head as Wanda sat down next to her.</p><p>“Christ, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh that turned into a cough, her smile lazy on her face. She could only hear her heartbeat in her ears, her mind completely empty of thoughts for the first time in months.</p><p>“You’re the one who kept speeding up.”</p><p>Wanda groaned and dropped back next to her.</p><p>“I just wanted it to be over.”</p><p>Agatha played with the spikes of grass by her head, twisting and tearing at them. She was quiet for a few beats of time, focused on the breeze drying the sweat on her skin. It had been ridiculous to do this so late and both of them would be paying for it in the morning.</p><p>Wanda hadn’t needed to join her but she had. No questions.</p><p>Agatha could give a little ground for that.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Wanda’s head rolled to the side so she could look at Agatha.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look back. It was as simple as speaking a single word to bring the heaviness rushing back. She thought about what she was running from and closed her eyes to try and lose herself in her strained breathing.</p><p>Wanda spoke quietly.</p><p>“William told me that you were the one that found the discrepancy in the barn.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, lightly shaking her head.</p><p>“The kid doesn’t know how to seize an opportunity.” Agatha shrugged. “It’s his find. He saw something when the rest of us made assumptions.”</p><p>“He’ll be an incredible agent if he decides to pursue it.” Wanda’s fingers touched Agatha’s wrist once, then drew back. “You are a good mentor to him, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and slowly sat up, her knees drawing into her chest, her arms wrapping around them. It wasn’t ideal for her recovering lungs but it made her feel grounded; anchored. She groaned and pressed her forehead into her forearm.</p><p>They sat in silence for several minutes before a buzz sounded from her phone. Agatha withdrew it and laughed weakly.</p><p>“I think I’m going to lose ownership of Señor Scratchy to your son.”</p><p>Wanda sat up and leaned closer to see the image displayed on Agatha’s screen.</p><p>Vision had sent a video of Billy squealing as Señor Scratchy leapt from floor to couch and bounced around him, back legs kicking up. The bunny repeated the action several times, absolutely cruising around the living room in the guest house. Near the end, Senor Scratchy landed on the couch and simply flopped onto his side beside Billy.</p><p>Billy looked up at the screen with the widest, most innocent eyes as he reached out to run his fingers through Scratchy’s fur.</p><p>
<i>”Dad look, he likes me!</i>
</p><p>Wanda chuckled, her eyes a little faraway. She opened her mouth to say something, hesitated, then gave Agatha a wry grin.</p><p>“He’s not allowed to have a pet yet. But I do think you may have a frequent visitor when we get back. If you’re okay with it, of course.”</p><p>Agatha could see the ache in Wanda’s expression. She’d seen it many times before on longer assignments; she’d worn that expression too. Agatha felt inclined to speak to it, to let Wanda know she could talk about missing her family without Agatha crumbling.</p><p>She started to say just that, lips parting, when a pained sob threatened to spill out. Agatha sucked in a breath, dizzy with the rapid onset and angry at the weakness. She twisted at the ring finger of her left hand, pulling the skin hard enough to burn. She forced a normal tone.</p><p>“I’m sure Señor Scratchy will need more love than I can give him.”</p><p>It was all she could offer Wanda and it didn’t feel like nearly enough. Agatha pushed herself to her feet, the high from the run wearing off quickly enough that she was certain her sleep would come just as poorly as the nights before.</p><p>Wanda followed suit and they headed inside to a silent, sleeping house. They made their way to the second floor and Agatha kept walking as Wanda stopped at her door. She didn’t have any more words in her tonight. Her mouth felt like ash, like burned paper and dried flowers.</p><p>Wanda called to her as Agatha reached her own door.</p><p>“Good night, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her key into the lock and escaped.</p><p>She lay wide awake, her eyes fixed on a black mark on the ceiling; possibly a squashed bug or a defect in the plaster. She blinked back the onset of tears several times, delirious and yet somehow restless. She thought about the hundreds of nights just like this that she had defeated with a hefty pour or several from a cheap handle or bottle of wine. It had been so much easier then, the sensations in her body dull enough to override, to distract herself from.</p><p>It was like driving back to DC had doused her in arctic water, had ripped her from a hazy dream where things were not good, but they were blunted. Agatha pulled her comforter to her chest and wished it was Nicky’s quilt. She turned to her side and the blinking no longer worked to stem the flow of tears.</p><p>
<i>”Are you still awake?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha quickly closed her eyes and said nothing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio laughed tiredly and she reached out to poke at Agatha’s cheek and Agatha joined her laughter a moment later, her smile hidden in the dark as she collected Rio’s hand in hers and held it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio rolled onto her side and Agatha glanced over, just able to make out the sleepy cast to her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha squeezed her hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Go back to sleep, darling.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s fingers slipped from her own and touched gently between Agatha’s brows to ease the furrow there. She traced down Agatha’s cheek, ghosted the pads of her fingers across Agatha’s lips, and let her hand settle on Agatha’s sternum.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Talk to me?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s shoulders relaxed slightly as she fixed her attention to the mild pressure, to the gentle strokes up the side of her neck. She let her hands fall to her swollen stomach and sighed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t want to fail this child.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stilled and Agatha could feel the intensity of her gaze.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You couldn’t possibly.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha smiled briefly, her head lolling to the side so she could meet Rio’s eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You have to say that.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio didn’t match her amusement. She lifted herself so she could look down at Agatha, her expression serious.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No, I don’t.” Rio studied her closely, her lips pulled into a thin line. “Why are you thinking like this?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha sighed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t know what a mother is supposed to look like. My only experience– what if I’m like my–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio cut her off quickly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re not.” The hand on Agatha’s chest pressed to emphasize Rio’s next words. “My love, there is not a single piece of you that could ever be like her.” Rio leaned down, pressed her lips to Agatha’s forehead. “Every single part of our lives has prepared us to give this child the things we were never afforded. All he will know is unconditional love and devotion and joy from his two really fucking kickass moms.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed through fresh tears. She rolled carefully onto her side and felt a little thrill as Rio’s hand slid up, settled lightly on her throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I <i>knew</i> you were going to look at the ultrasound you sneaky, little shit.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes widened almost comically and she leaned in to smother Agatha in kisses, her lips touching every part of her face as Agatha’s laughter increased.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha put up a half-assed fight, her hands pressing at Rio’s jaw and forehead and brow as she shouted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re in <i>so</i> much fucking trouble, Vidal.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio burrowed into Agatha’s neck and lips moving quickly, rhythmically as she spoke.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s not my fault! It fell–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It was sealed!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio groaned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It was an accident.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s back, her face aching from her grin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re a liar and a scoundrel.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio snickered, her teeth nipping at the sensitive skin beneath Agatha’s ear.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You love me that way.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha playfully bemoaned that fact.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh god, I do.” She slid her palm under the hem of Rio’s shirt, touching the soft panes of her back. “You cannot teach our child to be the same.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio melted into Agatha’s embrace, a pleased hum in her throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Cross my heart.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We’ve already established that you’re a liar.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hand slid from the back of Agatha’s neck to her stomach, resting there for a moment before slipping to the stretchy hem of Agatha’s maternity pants.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I can make it up to you.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha gasped as Rio’s fingers slid lower, parted her, began to tease. Agatha let out a breathy scoff.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It doesn’t count for much when my increased estrogen levels do all the pre-work for you.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio lifted her head and pressed a firm kiss to Agatha’s lips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I love when you talk dirty to me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s laugh turned into a whine as Rio’s fingers sunk to the knuckles without resistance.</i>
</p><p>______________</p><p>Agatha woke the next morning to an alarming amount of sunlight drenching her room. She felt bad, but not nearly as awful as her barely three hours of sleep should have made her.</p><p>Agatha scrambled for her phone and her heart lurched in her chest as she saw the time. 8:05. The team was meant to be at the ROC by 7:00 to complete a short briefing and head out to their assigned locations. Agatha flung herself out of bed, wobbly legs nearly giving out as they took on her weight before they were ready. She grimaced as she pulled clean clothes onto her unshowered body. Her only clean pants were her navy slacks and she yanked them up her legs before stretching a navy sweater over her head. She shoved her feet in matching oxfords and half-donned the navy crew neck suit jacket before tumbling out of her room in full monochrome.</p><p>The house was entirely quiet and Agatha couldn’t believe they hadn’t woken her. She strode toward the door, opening her texts, when she heard movement from the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha slowed, eyes falling to the start of a text from Wanda stating that she could come in around nine due to the fact that she wasn’t going out in the field.</p><p>Agatha pocketed her phone as her panic tapered out and shoved her arm into the other sleeve of her jacket before walking in view of the kitchen.</p><p>William.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief and stepped into the kitchen only to find herself waylaid with the sight of Rio standing by the stove, her brows furrowed in annoyance. She looked absurd.</p><p>Black slacks, white tank top, checkered apron. The image was so confusing that it took Agatha staring for several moments before she realized that her heart was pounding in her ears.</p><p>Rio’s arms flexed as she tried to crack an egg against the edge of a bowl. The lithe form of her standing like a perfect portrait against the white walls, only marred by Rio’s clear agitation. Her hair was pulled into a loose bun and strands of it ghosted the edge of her jaw.</p><p>Nostalgia unlike anything Agatha had ever felt previously trickled down her spine and softened her, for just a moment, reverted her to a woman she had forgotten. She stared at the dark lines of tattoos peeking from Rio’s back, the way the fabric clung to her stomach, the stretch of it against her shoulder blades. Agatha’s mouth dried out.</p><p>It was a small clank from behind her that dragged her attention away. She turned sharply, nearly sending a chair across the kitchen floor, and found William staring.</p><p>Her cheeks burned and she quickly sat down, snapping at him.</p><p>“Your food is getting cold with all your gawking.”</p><p>William looked down at his bowl and frowned.</p><p>“This is cereal.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced, twisting her hand in dismissal.</p><p>William glanced over her shoulder and leaned closer.</p><p>“Director Vidal is scary.”</p><p>Agatha refused to turn and look. She noted Rio’s jacket sitting over the back of a kitchen chair, a white button-down laying over it with a fresh grease stain on the sleeve of it.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>William met her eyes.</p><p>“She said she was making herself breakfast and asked if I wanted anything. I didn’t realize when I said yes how much she hated cooking.”</p><p>Agatha felt like a shark caught on the shore, her natural talents useless in the face of William whispering about her ex-wife while said ex-wife dropped pieces of shell into the pan with the eggs.</p><p>She pressed her hand into her forehead.</p><p>“Just eat the food when she gives it to you.”</p><p>William looked more afraid.</p><p>“What?! Will she fire me if I don’t?”</p><p>Agatha shot him an irritated roll of her eyes.</p><p>“No, Fido, it’s just not as bad as it looks.”</p><p>William seemed to be taking that in, marinating, then–</p><p>“How do you– have you tried it?”</p><p>There was a clatter from behind them and Agatha nearly leapt out of her skin, William freezing in the same way. A victorious sound came from Rio, nearly feral, and Agatha’s face pinched at the scrape of metal on metal.</p><p>
<i>”That’s Teflon dear, please don’t make me eat metal shavings for lunch.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha was in a nightmare. That was it. She just needed to wake up.</p><p>Rio appeared at her right and dropped a plate of scrambled eggs in front of William. She glanced at Agatha.</p><p>“Ran out, sorry Agent Harkness.”</p><p>William seemed to take that as his opportunity. He started to slide the plate toward Agatha.</p><p>“You can have mine.”</p><p>Rio and Agatha’s mirrored, sharp ‘no’s’ stilled his hand.</p><p>“Oh my god.” He seemed uncertain as he dragged the plate back. “Sorry, thank you Director Vidal.”</p><p>Rio smiled in a way that Agatha knew meant she was attempting to scare the kid.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes slid low, noted the stretch of fabric on Rio’s chest as she sat down with the stupid apron still on. She looked like a panther with a bow around its neck. Agatha’s next comment came out strained.</p><p>“Will you put on your clothes!”</p><p>William stared at his plate like he might be able to disappear if he thought about it hard enough.</p><p>Rio glanced down at her apron-clad torso and then back to Agatha. Her eyes sparkled smugly and Agatha cleared her throat, her chair screeching as it slid backward.</p><p>“I forgot my badge.”</p><p>Agatha nearly bolted out of the room. She was molten. It was as if she’d been dragged eleven years in the past and dropped off on the day she’d stayed at Rio’s for the first time.</p><p>
<i>Agatha blinked, stretched, groaned at the ache in her muscles and between her legs. She was cocooned in a soft, forest green duvet and her bare legs slid against the silky sheets as she shifted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She looked around Rio’s room, blinking away sleep as she took in the dozens of dried flowers wrapped in wire and hung from the ceiling in no visible pattern. The large window in the room was currently covered by blackout curtains and the only light came from the hallway.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The walls were covered in the footprints of Rio’s life. A patch of what looked like floor tiles ranging from grand and gaudy to plain white, dirty and cracked, took up a portion of the wall by the door. Small animal skulls and skeletons littered the shelves, each wrapped and filled by dried flowers that turned something rather unsettling into something beautiful.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She had vintage prints from Rocky Horror Picture Show, Halloween, The Thing, The Shining, Scream, and several other horror films placed against the off-white walls. There were two bookshelves in the room, though most of the books seemed to be literally anywhere else, sitting open or bookmarked.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was a strange place, but Agatha felt like she belonged in it, nestled into a pillow that smelled so much like Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She sat up, the sheets falling, and moved to Rio’s set of drawers. She stole a pair of boxers and a threadbare t-shirt before giving the room another once-over.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had only moved in two weeks prior, a slight upgrade from her previous studio, and Agatha wondered how she had already made the apartment feel so lived in.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Neither of them had much time, their fledgling careers as Agents keeping them up at all hours and stealing their weekends. But they’d made a concerted effort to carve out space for each other.</i>
</p><p>
<i>This thing between them was still fresh, it still buzzed in Agatha’s nerves as they danced around one another, learned and discovered parts and pieces. Their histories and hurts were still locked away, both afraid that shining a light on them would ruin what they had found together.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But Agatha could feel it; the dark parts of Rio’s soul lurking, waiting. It was in the way she sometimes looked at Agatha, the fear that sat behind her eyes like Agatha might change her mind, like she might disappear. It was in the way she dedicated herself to her work, the dogged perseverance to be perfect, to complete every single task without flaw. Agatha saw it in the way Rio had laid claim to her new space with so much intention, in the tattoos that ran up her spine, the lack of personal photographs in her apartment.</i>
</p><p>
<i>There was only one displayed, a picture that Agatha couldn’t look at for too long. It was Rio, maybe twelve, with her arm around a boy a little older. He had dark skin and a crooked smile, his hand was on her head, scrunching up her hair playfully. Rio was making a face mixed between a smile and a grimace as she looked up toward the boy. Rio’s hair was cut jagged to her shoulders, the boy’s hair was buzzed. Both had on ratty-looking clothes and small patches of blues and blacks littered their skin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The photo itself was bent and wrinkled like it had been kept loose for years before being framed. Every time Agatha looked at it her heart broke. It felt haunted. She wasn’t sure why, nor did she have any intention to ask. Not yet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha padded out of Rio’s room toward the smells and sounds of food being made. She smiled as she came into view.</i>
</p><p>
<i>”Are you cooking me breakfast?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio turned. She had on Agatha’s unbuttoned, white dress shirt with a black apron over it that hung lower than the shirt, the bottom touching Rio’s knees. There was a cartoon grim reaper on the pocket and a dirty spatula tucked inside. She stared as Agatha approached, her gaze lilting toward hunger.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes. I’m an excellent cook.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha looked to the messy pan, brows raising, head nodding slowly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Right. Yeah.” She moved closer, tilted her head. “And you’re cooking– what is that?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked affronted, motioning toward the pan.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s breakfast.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stepped up next to her and peered down at the concoction in the pan.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay. Sure. What kind of breakfast?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio crossed her arms, eyes narrowing sharply as she turned to Agatha. She took her spatula out of her pocket and, for very obvious reasons, Agatha felt like it was now being wielded as a weapon. Rio brandished it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What do you mean?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shook her head, hands out as she backed away slowly, amusement dancing on her lips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No, you’re right. It’s breakfast. I love breakfast.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stalked toward her and pieces of yellow-white dripped off of the spatula onto the floor. Rio promptly walked through it with her socked feet. She pointed the spatula at Agatha’s chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you have something to say, Harkness?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha reached the table’s edge, her legs bumping against it. She saw Rio’s eyes trail over her and darken.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shook her head, then reconsidered.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Well, you have…egg?” she added a questioning inflection on the word, “on your sock.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s threatening countenance faltered, her brow furrowing as she lifted her foot to look. A slight pout turned her expression.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha adored her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio took off her sock, leaving the other on. She sheathed her spatula and gave Agatha a look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You got lucky this time.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She turned back to the stove.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha learned four things that morning. One, Rio’s was an actual nightmare in the kitchen but the flavors were surprisingly pleasant. Two, Rio was very sensitive about her cooking abilities and would possibly cause bodily harm if questioned. Three, being fucked over a kitchen table with one of her hands half resting in leftover scrambled eggs was so much better than Agatha could have conceptualized. Four, Rio’s ability to be both alarmingly hot and so goddamned strange made Agatha nearly feral.</i>
</p><p>Agatha returned to her room and beelined for her bathroom to splash water on her heated face. She mindlessly completed the tasks she’d decided to skip upon waking up in a panic and fought to scrape at the gooey, warm feelings in her body until she was left with muscle and bone and the cavernous hole she’d made her home in.</p><p>She waited until the last possible moment to return downstairs and trail a redressed Rio and a still-confused William outside.</p><p>——</p><p>As they walked toward the ROC entrance, Rio ahead of them by several steps, William moved closer to Agatha.</p><p>“Was that weird, or…?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No, she’s normally a freak.”</p><p>William looked with concern toward Rio.</p><p>“Should you say that about the SAC?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“What? You plan on tattling?”</p><p>William shook his head vehemently.</p><p>“No! Just— what if she hears us?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged and glared daggers into Rio’s spine.</p><p>“I hope she does.”</p><p>They made their way to the command center to find the Chief already there, her eyes passing over dozens of screens that had been brought in and set up for easier viewing.</p><p>The Chief of Police smiled at Rio.</p><p>“Director, welcome. Nothing of interest yet. The teams are doing well; getting along.”</p><p>Agatha mentally noted that she nor the intern had been greeted. She watched Rio sit directly beside the Chief and made a choice to find a spot several chairs away.</p><p>William followed her.</p><p>She looked around the space and her original confusion from the morning returned. She frowned at William.</p><p>“Why did they move our go-time back?”</p><p>William shrugged as he started spinning slowly in his chair.</p><p>“Director Vidal and Agent Maximoff had a conversation this morning and the Director sent them off without us.”</p><p>Of course she did.</p><p>Agatha dropped her head back against the chair and looked toward the screens depicting the locations of interest. The dock and sports facility were relatively close with audio and visuals coming in. The team at Veridi’s home had a single visual from quite far away. She sighed.</p><p>“This is going to be egregiously boring, William. Buckle up.”</p><p>“They said we could help with logistics.”</p><p>Agatha let out a dry laugh.</p><p>“Logistics.” She closed her eyes. “We are the team watching the people that are watching buildings.” William made an awkward coughing noise as she continued. “It’s a fucking snooze-fest. I’d personally rather choke on rocks, but at least we have air conditioning.”</p><p>Chief Koutsou cleared her throat far closer than she’d been moments prior.</p><p>When Agatha’s eyes pried open, she peered up into her stern face and smiled her fakest smile.</p><p>“Depending on when you walked over, I was talking about joining William for his weekly improv classes.”</p><p>Koutsou huffed.</p><p>“I imagine you are very good at your job to still have one with this being your general disposition.”</p><p>Agatha ignored the prod.</p><p>“What can I do for you, Chief?”</p><p>Chief Koutsou tossed several folders on the table in front of them.</p><p>“Your Director said I could utilize you during down time to look at a few cases for the HPD.” She nodded toward William. “It’ll be good for the intern.”</p><p>Agatha feigned offense, leaning slightly back to locate Rio.</p><p>“He has a name.”</p><p>William stood and held out his hand.</p><p>“William Kaplan. I actually looked into your history, Chief. Well— what I had access to. You have had an incredible career.”</p><p>Koutsou seemed surprised, mildly pleased.</p><p>“Thank you, Mr. Kaplan.” She tapped the files. “Let me know if you have any questions.”</p><p>As she walked away, Agatha could see Rio returning with two cups of coffee in hand. She sat back down beside the Chief and slid one over.</p><p>Something dark and spiky reared its head in Agatha’s chest and she quickly yanked open the first file.</p><p>_____________</p><p>By the time three PM rolled around, Agatha had raided the break room and brought back a deck of cards, a chess set with a missing piece, and a box of donuts that had been brought in for the IT team.</p><p>She stuffed one in her mouth to drown out the grumble in her stomach as William stared at the chess board in front of him.</p><p>He pointed at the bullet she’d set on her side to replace the missing pawn.</p><p>“Shouldn’t we use something other than live ammunition?”</p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p>“Just play. You’re lucky I’m letting you start with white.”</p><p>William pushed the Queen’s pawn.</p><p>“You had me pick a hand.”</p><p>Agatha grunted and played to d5. She smirked when he moved his Bishop out.</p><p>“The London is a solid opening.”</p><p>William looked up with his eyes narrowed in suspicion.</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>Agatha moved her Knight to f6, brow raised.</p><p>“That’s what I just said.”</p><p>He continued the main line, playing knight to f3. Agatha smiled and immediately attacked his intended structure.</p><p>____________</p><p>Forty minutes later, William was staring at the board with his head in his hands, his eyes looking forlornly at the f2 square where his single pawn was protected only by the King. Both Agatha’s dark-squared Bishop and her Queen were lined up in a battery heading for the weak pawn, and the f file was wide open for her Rook to claim. He frowned at her.</p><p>“Don’t look so smug.”</p><p>Agatha feigned offense.</p><p>“I always look like this.”</p><p>He looked toward the doors where Koutsou and Rio had disappeared two hours prior.</p><p>“Do you know where they went?”</p><p>She did not. The monster that had coiled in her chest was alive and hungry now. Her mild respect for the Chief had soured incredibly.</p><p>“No. Stop wasting time.”</p><p>William groaned and reached forward, knocking over his King.</p><p>“I’m not winning this.”</p><p>Agatha blew out a breath, her lips pulling down.</p><p>“Coward.”</p><p>He laughed, already gathering his pieces and resetting them on the board.</p><p>“You are way better than me. I just learned how to play to impress my boyfriend’s grandmother.”</p><p>Agatha reset the black pieces and slid the board away, leaving the bullet in as a pawn.</p><p>“Don’t beat yourself up, I’m better than most people.”</p><p>William grabbed the deck of cards and began to shuffle, a cocky grin appearing.</p><p>“Fine. We’ll see how you fare in a real game.”</p><p>___________</p><p>They’d only played through the first hand of something called ‘Golf’ when Rio and the Chief returned, pushing through the door with two large paper bags. Agatha didn’t look up, only continued to play through her turn of the silly game based purely on luck.</p><p>Koutsou walked over and set one of the bags on the table beside Agatha, the jolt knocking over two of the chess pieces and her bullet.</p><p>“Your diligence is astounding, Agent Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, eyes falling to the files.</p><p>“Oh? Were these meant to be completed in a timely fashion?”</p><p>Rio spoiled her fun before Koutsou could rebuke her.</p><p>“Don’t waste your breath. She’s completed them already.”</p><p>Koutsou frowned and sifted through the cases, brows pinched. She picked up one and glanced at Agatha.</p><p>“All of them?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, already reaching for the paper bag that smelled like french fries and grease-covered meat.</p><p>“I get that you couldn’t give us any sensitive cases due to your clamorous mistrust, but gas station robbery? Hit and run? Shoplifting? Vandalism?” Agatha smiled. “If you wanted to waste our time, leaving us to monitor the teams on surveillance was enough.”</p><p>Koutsou picked up the multiple folders and sifted through them. She turned the last over.</p><p>“The homicide?”</p><p>Agatha had already found the fries and set them in front of herself.</p><p>“I mean, I can’t make arrests from here, nor do I have any kind of access to the witnesses or suspects, but I’d bet these fries it was the man on camera shooting the gun.” Agatha stuffed her mouth, a bitter glee flooding her as she saw the agitation roll over the Chief’s face. She’d been a hard nut to crack but Agatha was persistent. “Did you not look at the files before handing them over?”</p><p>The Chief’s jaw tensed for a moment before releasing.</p><p>“I did not.” Her next words seemed to come out with more reluctance. “Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha withdrew several cardboard containers and set them down in front of herself and William. She lifted a group of fries up in salute and then stuffed them in her mouth.</p><p>“And thank you!”</p><p>When the Chief moved back, Agatha let the heady pride of victory rear its head. For the next few minutes, she could let her shredded emotions sink below the surface.</p><p>For the next few minutes, she could breathe.</p>

<p>The ease of pressure, of tension, lasted until Chief Koutsou excused herself to handle an emergency in another department. She’d said that her interim would arrive around seven to relieve them and had clearly only been speaking to Rio.</p><p>Agatha felt a mix of relief and irritation at her departure, but she let herself veer hard into the latter. She had another forty-seven minutes of sitting in this room, staring at screens, and avoiding Rio’s general location, before she could bury herself beneath her pillow for a solid four to six hours of sleep.</p><p>Even optimistic William was struggling to maintain his energy, his body slumped in his chair. He glanced at Agatha, his voice weary.</p><p>“I can’t believe there’s nothing else we could be doing.”</p><p>Agatha shot him a look of warning but it was too late. Rio turned to look from her position right in front of the multiple screens. She looked far too pleased.</p><p>“There’s mountains of paperwork if you’re feeling bored.”</p><p>William looked to Agatha for help but she held out her hands.</p><p>“One must learn by digging their own graves, kid.”</p><p>William grimaced and stood, looking around the space for said paperwork.</p><p>Rio tilted her head to the hall.</p><p>“My office. It’s stacked on the left corner of the desk. You can bring them back here.”</p><p>William resigned himself and Agatha’s eyes trailed after him as he left the room.</p><p>The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end the moment he was out of sight. She stared at the game of solitaire in front of her and ignored the sound of Rio rising from her chair.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up even as Rio flipped a free chair and sat directly across from her, their knees bumping under the table. Agatha’s fingers tightened on the cards in her hands and she placed one down stiffly.</p><p>Rio’s elbows settled on the table, her chin dropping onto her hands.</p><p>“You’ve been quieter today.”</p><p>Agatha was under no illusion that Rio’s curious tone would lead to anything beyond a ploy to tip the scales in her favor. She placed another card on the table and refreshed her hand.</p><p>“I hadn’t noticed.”</p><p>There was a finite amount of time before William returned and Agatha was determined not to give an inch.</p><p>Rio clearly had other plans. She slid her knee between Agatha’s and parted them, a low hum in her throat as they went easily.</p><p>“Still so responsive.”</p><p>Agatha froze. She knew her breath would come out shaky so she held it as Rio let her knee rest on the inside of her own. Her body was tense, every part of her awareness suddenly laser-focused on the woman in front of her. She saw the arrogant curve to Rio’s brow, the expectation there, the intensity of her gaze.</p><p>“You’re playing a very reckless game, Director Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha could hear the hazy edge in her own voice and she watched Rio’s eyes flicker to her lips.</p><p>Rio’s gaze didn’t waver as she spoke.</p><p>“Have you thought about it, Agatha?”</p><p>Her voice curled around the syllables of her name like she was tasting the shape of it.</p><p>Agatha ground her teeth shut and blindly discarded the trio in her hand before moving to pick up more.</p><p>“Not once.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, the sound of it tapping into Agatha’s veins.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what drove the next words but she tried to claw them back as they escaped her lips.</p><p>“Why don’t you take the Chief for a spin? I bet she’d let you choke her.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened in surprise, her smile growing. William entered the room as Rio stood, voice low in her response.</p><p>“She wouldn’t like it nearly as much as you.”</p><p>Rio returned to her chair and William dropped next to Agatha. He looked like a kicked puppy, a stark splash of water to Agatha’s current psyche. She frowned deeply and continued to play her game.</p><p>Rio glanced back at William.</p><p>“Expense Reports, Preliminary Summaries, Public Records. The rest are above your clearance.” Rio motioned toward Agatha. “She can help you if you have any questions.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced, shooting a deadly glare toward William.</p><p>He looked at his files with wide eyes and slowly separated the ones he could work on. He opened the first and stared at it blankly for almost two minutes.</p><p>Agatha groaned loudly and yanked the first stack on top of her card game. She was going to lose anyway. With a very complex combination of feelings churning in her gut, she set to work filling out the documents as poorly as possible. Just enough that Rio would have to waste a decent amount of time making corrections.</p><p>________________</p><p> </p><p>At the end of day three of their surveillance, Agatha was prepared to get arrested if it meant the case would stop dragging on. Things at the ROC were tenuous at best, both Agatha and Rio having fallen into a brittle stalemate.</p><p>They’d gotten a few false alarms. One at the sport’s facility with a group of kids breaking in to vandalize and drink themselves into a stupor. Alice and Ioannidis had sat back to watch, their next several hours filled with the drunk commentary of fifteen year old kids.</p><p>The second was at the docks. A member of Veridi’s extended family had taken a joy-ride on the small, dingy fishing vessel that had been sitting at the dock. Kale and Zervas had also refrained from intervening.</p><p>Agatha was sitting in her same chair, William beside her as she stared at the grainy image of Veridi’s home.</p><p>William had completed the paperwork under Agatha’s sharp corrections and had definitely learned his lesson on keeping his mouth shut. Boredom was to be complained about when no consequences could follow.</p><p>Now they would wait for the catalyst; either Veridi would make a mistake or Koutsou would hurry the fuck up on getting their warrants.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked to the multiple angles of the small dock. She narrowed her eyes as a car drove by on the long, two-lane road that ran past the dock. Agatha stood and walked toward the screens. She took the remote from where it lay in front of Koutsou and ignored the questions it prompted.</p><p>She began to rewind, searching…. There. She paused on the same car that had passed by minutes before.</p><p>“We might have action at the docks.”</p><p>Before Rio or the Chief could respond, Jennifer called in.</p><p>
<i>”There’s a gray Volkswagen Polo that has made a second pass at our location. License FFT 6794.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You don’t say. Do you have eyes on them?”</p><p>
<i>”Agatha, how’s timeout? I was radioing in to speak to an adult.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha pressed two of the comm links together to create ear-piercing feedback through the connection.</p><p>Several shouts sounded from the three teams and Rio reached forward to yank the comm out of Agatha’s hand. She shot Agatha a tired look before speaking to Kale.</p><p>“This is Vidal. Do you have eyes on the vehicle?”</p><p>The Chief was already searching for the license, her fingers flying across her keyboard.</p><p>There was a sound of a door opening and then Kale came through.</p><p>
<i>”I’m moving to a closer vantage point, The Captain is staying put. It looks like it turned toward that neighboring house.”</i>
</p><p>The Chief frowned.</p><p>“They do not have a Volkswagen registered to their names.” She tapped her fingers impatiently as a file loaded. “Got it. This license plate was reported stolen four hours ago. It belonged to a Hyundai i10 registered to a family in Athens.” She stood and immediately radioed her next orders. “Support Team, be prepared to close in on the docks.”</p><p>Agatha felt the first dredges of adrenaline churn in her chest and she began to follow.</p><p>The Chief turned, eyes sharp, and paused. She looked Agatha over and drew in a breath.</p><p>“If you make me regret taking you along, I’ll find a way to make your life hell.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a bright smile.</p><p>“You’re going to have to do better than that, Chief. I’ve been in hell for a long time.”</p><p>______________</p><p> </p><p>The ride to the docks took almost thirty-five minutes and Agatha’s skin was itching. She was trapped in a car alone with Rio and Koutsou, her only moments of respite coming from conversation amongst the surveillance teams.</p><p>She had purposefully sat behind Rio to avoid any unwanted eye contact; the additional perk came from her ability to press her foot into the back of the seat to cause her mild discomfort and annoyance.</p><p>Jen called in.</p><p>
<i>”No movement at the docks.</i>
</p><p>Jen had been told to hold off on approaching the vacation home until a larger team could get into position.</p><p>Agatha shifted, feeling the reassuring weight of the P99 sitting against her hip. She frowned as Alice spoke over the comms.</p><p>
<i>”We have movement here. South entrance of the facility.”</i>
</p><p>Wanda’s voice followed after.</p><p>
<i>”Possible activity on Veridi’s property.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s mind began to parse through the information they’d gathered on Veridi and his overplanning.</p><p>Koutsou ordered the Constables on route to split toward the other two locations.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward to look at the Chief.</p><p>“It’s the docks.”</p><p>To her credit, there was only mild skepticism in Koutsou’s tone as she responded.</p><p>“Why do you say that?”</p><p>Rio answered for her.</p><p>“Veridi’s web of bribes was overkill. He paid more money more frequently than he needed to. Sure, it kept him clean if nobody was looking, but that map is easy to follow once you have the scent.” Rio shrugged. “Agent Harkness is making the assumption that he’s overdoing it again.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her foot harder into Rio’s seat.</p><p>“I’m right. People with that kind of need for absolute control can’t just change their approach. Veridi is splitting our attention but the dock is his only avenue of escape that isn’t heavily regulated.”</p><p>The Chief held her radio to her mouth, debating the merit, before radioing the change in command.</p><p>“Support Team, stay in-route to the docks. Split pairs out to locations two and three.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t bother to hide her smug expression as she settled into her seat.</p><p>The Chief rolled their vehicle to a stop half a mile from where Jen and Captain Ioannidis were bunkered down. Two vehicles of Constables had already arrived and they had unloaded, strapped on vests, and armed themselves with MP5s. They all turned to their Chief as she stepped out of the vehicle.</p><p>Within three minutes, Koutsou had split the constables into two teams. She took half toward the vacation home and sent Agatha and Rio toward the docks with sharp commands and a word of warning.</p><p>“Director Vidal, I expect there will be no surprises. The Captain will converge with you.”</p><p>She looked to Agatha.</p><p>Rio intervened.</p><p>“Agent Harkness knows how to follow orders, Chief. Let’s move.”</p><p>The words splashed acidic inside Agatha’s chest and she turned toward the Constables at her back. They looked severe, agitated, and many of them had their eyes on her like she might be the criminal. That didn’t bode well.</p><p>A hand gripped her arm and she instinctively pulled to no avail.</p><p>Rio– no– Director Vidal was looking at her. No games, no power plays. She held Agatha’s gaze without waver and her voice was quiet, demanding. It was so similar to the one that picked Agatha apart but the traces of affection had vanished.</p><p>“Behave like you want to keep your job, Agatha.” Agatha rolled her eyes, stomach clenching. Rio’s grip tightened, her eyes narrowed. She looked every inch of the leader she had become, the lines of her face razor-sharp. “No. Don’t fuck around. Don’t listen to your pride, listen to me. You do what I say. If I’m not there, you do what the Captain says. Do you understand me?”</p><p>Agatha’s blood, already pumping from adrenaline, seared through her. Rio like this was…. She couldn’t find words fast enough.</p><p>Rio’s hand became a vice on her arm, the pressure turning to pain as she stepped closer.</p><p>“Agent Harkness. Do. You. Understand. Yes or no?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, her heartbeat out of control. She couldn’t look away.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>It came out much smoother than Agatha expected, only a trace amount of something unprofessional curling through the breath she took after.</p><p>Rio let her go and turned, waiting for the Chief’s word to move in.</p><p>Agatha stood beside her, her arm throbbing in time with her chest. She blinked, cleared her throat, and settled in place at Rio’s back.</p><p>__________</p><p>The order was given ten minutes later and Rio led the team toward the docks, their steps hugging closely to the tree line separating them from the water.</p><p>Agatha was already sweating, her hairline damp in the mild humidity. The eight constables at her back were surprisingly quiet with their steps as they trailed her.</p><p>Rio slowed them as they came in sight of the docks, the three prongs of it shooting out into the water. The trees came to an abrupt stop and left a gap of about forty feet with little to no cover. At the other end of the gap was the fence that surrounded the property; it was filled with storage containers, pieces of old, rusted boats, fuel tanks, and various scrap materials.</p><p>Rio called in.</p><p>“Kale, what’s your position?”</p><p>
<i>”We’re at a gap in the fence north of the enclosed dock. No movement sighted.”</i>
</p><p>Rio motioned.</p><p>“Alright, we’re moving. Run low and stay quiet.”</p><p>She took off with Agatha at her heels, the Constables close behind. They moved into the unprotected space on high alert, eyes searching the gaps and slits in the fence for any threat. They made it about halfway before Agatha felt the hairs on her neck stand on end. She looked toward the road, toward the dockyard, then her gaze veered sharply toward the water just in time to notice movement and a fresh ripple spreading across the surface.</p><p>She matched pace with Rio.</p><p>“The water. Somebody’s in the water.”</p><p>Rio didn’t ask a single confirming question before calling it in.</p><p>“Alert. Movement in water. Could be more trouble than expected ahead. Captain, Kale, be careful.”</p><p>The Chief’s voice rang in, her tone elevated.</p><p>
<i>”Vacation house is clear, but there was recent activity. Multiple persons were living here. Ammunition and SCUBA gear have been left behind. We’re heading toward you. Watch your sixes.”</i>
</p><p>Rio slowed them at the fence, crouching low, listening.</p><p>The sound of water lapping against the shore, birds, heavy breaths, boats nudging against bumpers… the scrape of boots in the dirt just beyond the fence.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>The ten of them dropped in unison as gunfire erupted from inside, pelting into the fence, the dirt, ripping through reeds of grass.</p><p>Two constables tossed flashbangs over the fence, the concussive blasts silencing the spray of bullets as twin groans sounded from inside.</p><p>As a Constable began to climb, Agatha yanked him back down.</p><p>“You think they’re the only ones with guns?”</p><p>He looked at her like he hadn’t even considered it and Agatha saw how fresh he was, the face of a rookie who was certain the rules of life and death were different for people trying to protect and serve.</p><p>Rio motioned to a partial break in the fence and hissed a command.</p><p>“Provide cover fire, cut this open.”</p><p>Agatha aimed her gun inside with six other constables but didn’t shoot alongside their sprays. She had very limited bullets and she planned to make them count.</p><p>Two constables went to work on the fence, clipping rapidly until the hole was large enough to move through.</p><p>Rio patted her shoulder.</p><p>“Five in, five cover.”</p><p>Agatha moved in second-to-last under the protection of bullets slamming into the massive container fifteen feet away. A yelp caught her attention and she turned to find the rookie caught up in the fence.</p><p>“Oh for fucks—“</p><p>She cut herself off as she shoved her arm around him and yanked him to the ground just as enemy fire screamed around them. Agatha felt a dull burn in her arm as she dragged at the constable. He scampered toward cover with the other three tucked against a rust-red boat hull.</p><p>A constable tossed another flashbang as two opened fire. The earthshaking bang and echo was louder this time, jarring, and Agatha saw the rookie press in a panic against the metal hull, his eyes bugged wide.</p><p>She looked to make sure Rio and the others were moving in safely before gripping him by the collar and slamming him rather handily into the hull. He looked like a wild animal.</p><p>She got close to his face, breathing hard, ears ringing.</p><p>“You trained for this. You are better than this. Toughen the fuck up or stay put. You’ll feel so much worse if you get somebody killed.”</p><p>He blinked hard several times as the others fell in. Agatha didn’t let go. She didn’t break eye contact. She stared him down until his panic began to shift and turn toward embarrassment.</p><p>She slapped him.</p><p>“Don’t find another crisis. You’re already in one.”</p><p>He nodded sharply as Kale called in.</p><p>
<i>”We’re pinned in the warehouse. At least seven armed. They’re loading up a high-speed vessel. I think I see Veridi.”</i>
</p><p>Rio grimaced, eyes searching the yard around them for the clearest path.</p><p>“Don’t do anything stupid, Kale. Wait for us.”</p><p>The response was strained but huffy, littered with gunfire.</p><p>
<i>”Please. I’m not Harkness.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha nearly laughed as she released the rookie and patted his red cheek.</p><p>“Buck up, rook. You know what to do.”</p><p>A hand gripped her other wrist and lifted. Rio’s face was covered in a film of dirt, her expression severe.</p><p>“You’re bleeding.”</p><p>Agatha glanced down at the line of a rather irritating cut along her forearm. She rolled her neck.</p><p>“Fence. It’s fine.”</p><p>Rio nodded and turned toward the shipping container as bullets sprayed their cover.</p><p>“Wait until they reload. Four cover, five on me.”</p><p>The ten-second wait felt like it took hours. Agatha’s entire body was tensed for movement. At the first beat of silence, four Constables leaned out and offered cover as Rio led the charge forward.</p><p>Agatha locked in, her mind elevating, her instincts sharp. The pair of them moved together like they were in a predestined dance, Rio swinging around, firing twice, Agatha covering her back, taking out a black-suited individual as he appeared further into the yard.</p><p>It was the muscle-memory, the knowing, and Agatha’s body was more alive than it had been in years.</p><p>They crouched into cover again and Agatha saw several figures ahead, adjusting to cut them off from the enclosed dock. She grit her teeth. It would take ages moving like this.</p><p>Jen’s voice came through again, this time sharp and raised.</p><p>
<i>”Officer down! The Captain has a gunshot wound to the leg. They’re moving in on our location.”</i>
</p><p>The Chief called through.</p><p>
<i>”Thirty seconds out of the North gate!”</i>
</p><p>Jen spoke tersely through the line.</p><p>
<i>”They closed in behind us. You’ll have resistance. I moved him as far as I can but we’re sitting ducks in here.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha looked around them, sound muffling as orders were called and gunfire echoed and ricocheted in her ears. She saw a ladder leading up the back of the closest shipping container and peered around the corner. There was an entire row of them that led almost directly up to the old, greenish window of the enclosed dock.</p><p>Agatha took a step and stilled. She growled out in irritation and turned to Rio, tilting her head toward the ladder.</p><p>“I’m going up.”</p><p>Rio put the pieces together quickly.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha nearly snarled at her, her fingers curling into Rio’s vest.</p><p>“Kale is pinned and Veridi is escaping. Keep their attention on the ground and I can do something about it. I’ll stay low, lay some cover.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw snapped shut, her eyes searching Agatha’s. She took a breath, nodded.</p><p>“Go.”</p><p>Agatha did. She passed the rookie and motioned toward his belt.</p><p>“Mind if I borrow those?”</p><p>He passed over a pair of flashbangs without question and Agatha sprinted for the ladder. She climbed up toward the top and slowed, eyes looking for Rio, waiting for her command.</p><p>Rio glanced up at her and her face transformed for a moment, a pulse of fear in her eyes before she seemed to tamper it. She spoke quickly to the gathered Constables. They moved quickly. Two fired out, four ran across to take up cover on the other side, and Rio’s eyes fell back to Agatha.</p><p>She motioned the go-ahead and Agatha flung herself up, rolling into a crouch on the container. She didn’t stop to reconsider or question herself as she leapt to the next, ran, jumped again. Her feet hit metal, the echo of it enough to draw attention by the time she’d made it halfway down the line.</p><p>Agatha picked up her pace as bullets chased her steps, one splintering on metal and sending shrapnel into her calf. She groaned and kept running.</p><p>As she neared the last container, she realized the distance to the window was further than expected, likely about twelve feet across. She could hardly see inside, the panes crusted with salt and dirt, but she thought she could make out the shape of a railing.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze flicked down at the masked figures as she passed them, and noted a group of three blocking the entrance, their eyes already turned up toward her.</p><p>She steeled herself. Rio was going to be so fucking mad.</p><p>Agatha kept her pace, her arms pumping, her legs working overtime as she reached the edge of the shipping container and launched herself toward the window.</p><p>Shouts sounded from all around her as her arms crossed in front of her face, her eyes closing tightly shut. The panes shattered inward, their edges cutting into Agatha’s bared skin as she flew through them.</p><p>Dread flooded her body as she became weightless, began to fall, fall— she slammed ribs first into a metal railing.</p><p>Every bit of air compressed from her lungs as the metal shrieked from her momentum. She opened her eyes through the sting of sweat and blood in time to see multiple masked figures recovering from the explosion of glass.</p><p>She was on a catwalk that surrounded the small warehouse and just twenty feet away, she could see the boat Jen had mentioned and the man standing at the wheel that was undoubtedly Veridi. It was already moving forward toward the open gate, four figures in the back.</p><p>Agatha ripped the pins from both flashbangs as her vision blurred from lack of oxygen.</p><p>She grinned manically and tossed them both, a perfect arcing line, right into the boat.</p><p>The suited individuals and Veridi all dove away just as the concussive blast ripped through the warehouse.</p><p>Agatha’s smile fell as the metal railing gave way, her body lurching over and falling toward the cement below.</p><p>It wasn’t a far fall, the impact relatively mild to what it could have been, but Agatha still hadn’t caught her breath and her back landed on something ridged and sharp. She lost consciousness for a dizzying moment, her skin tingling, everything else numb as she blinked.</p><p>She heard so much noise, none of it making sense as she coughed and gasped desperately for air. She rolled over onto her elbow and looked toward the boat.</p><p>She could vaguely make out the blaze of flames and the bodies scrambling around, eyes watering, hands to their ears. Two fell in the water from the boat, three had jumped onto the dock. One stumbled back and fell, hitting his head sharply on the boat’s hull as it floated unmanned toward the exit.</p><p>Agatha looked around for her gun and saw it several feet away buried under debris. She pulled in lungfuls of stale, fishy air and began to drag herself toward it. Her earpiece was still alive with a cacophony of voices but she couldn’t make sense of the words. Her hand wrapped around the grip of her weapon and she used every bit of her strength to force herself to her feet. She stumbled and leaned heavily on the closest wall as the capable enemies regained their bearings.</p><p>Agatha fired twice, her ears still ringing, and drew back as they returned fire. Everything throbbed with a dull sort of pain that kept her alert and standing as she tried to sift through the ringing to make sense the chatter.</p><p>She saw movement around a stack of large barrels and blindly fired out to keep the hostels hesitant as she looked for better cover. She heaved in another lungful just as the ringing in her ears lessened enough to take in the end of Jen’s call.</p><p>
<i>”—on’t have eyes on Harkness but they’re pursuing something across the warehouse. Veridi is down. I’m counting five hostiles still on the move, two in pursuit.”</i>
</p><p>The Chief called in.</p><p>
<i>”We’ve cleared the path. On our way to you, Agent Kale.”</i>
</p><p>Rio’s voice followed.</p><p>
<i>”The last three are retreating into the warehouse. I want eyes on Harkness, now!”</i>
</p><p>Agatha glanced toward the double doors beneath a still-hanging section of the catwalk. It swayed precariously as the doors flew open and Agatha refocused her weapon on the remaining joint keeping the catwalk afloat.</p><p>She emptied her magazine even after the bullets hit their mark and forced a structural collapse.  Her finger squeezed repeatedly on empty as the three targets were knocked to the ground. Agatha’s arms gave out and she slumped against the wall just as Rio flew into the space, weapon raised, eyes searching.</p><p>Constables swarmed after her, some apprehending the suited figures as others spread out behind Rio and began to clear the enclosed dock.</p><p>Rio’s gaze swung across the warped metal debris until it fell to Agatha. Rio stilled, stared. Her chest was heaving and her temple was bruised and bleeding. Her shoulders relaxed slightly and she holstered her gun as she moved toward Agatha.</p><p>Her eyes were burning, her mask cracking as she climbed over the wreckage. She looked like her restraint was held by a very fine thread as she pressed her comm.</p><p>“Agent Harkness has been located.”</p><p>Rio wiped her own blood out of her eye as she closed in and Agatha couldn’t look away from the intensity there.</p><p>Rio’s hands were clinical as they searched her, prodded at her. Agatha groaned, still struggling to breathe, and pushed them away.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, the sound bitter as she knocked Agatha’s hands to the side. She worked the Velcro of the vest loose.</p><p>“Shut up, Agatha.”</p><p>The vest was pulled carefully over her head and Rio’s hand pressed firmly against Agatha’s ribs.</p><p>Agatha hissed, her stomach retracting as she flinched away.</p><p>Rio held her in place as she continued to test the integrity of her bones.</p><p>“Stop squirming.” She finished her count, withdrew. “Nothing is broken.”</p><p>Agatha offered a pained glare.</p><p>“I said I was fine.”</p><p>She pushed from the wall and felt a sharp, painful jab in her lower back. She nearly doubled over and Rio caught her, held her too close.</p><p>Rio propped her sideways against the wall, hand warm on her stomach as the other gingerly lifted Agatha’s shirt at her back.</p><p>Rio glared at her.</p><p>“Fine, huh?” She touched tender skin on Agatha’s back, beneath her ribcage. “You have a piece of wood in your back.”</p><p>Agatha hissed at the pressure and tried to convey an amusement she didn’t feel.</p><p>“Got any tweezers on you?”</p><p>Rio’s tongue rolled over her teeth in deep irritation and Agatha stared at her lips for too long. Rio shook her head and took a charged breath.</p><p>“What the fuck was that, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha feigned shock, her hand going to her chest.</p><p>“Me? I told you what I was doing. It’s not my fault you let me.”</p><p>If the sounds of multiple arrests and incoming sirens hadn’t been so loud, Agatha was certain she’d be able to hear Rio’s teeth grinding.</p><p>“You jumped through a window!”</p><p>Agatha pushed Rio’s hand off of her stomach. It was too distracting if they were about to get into such a deeply useless argument.</p><p>“The building plan said there was a catwalk!”</p><p>Rio’s expression darkened, the hand leaving Agatha’s stomach catching on Agatha’s wrist instead.</p><p>“No, it did not.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. She’d expected that to work.</p><p>“I saw it through the window.”</p><p>Rio looked incredulous.</p><p>“That could have been a shadow! Or dirt on the glass. It was a risk you should never have taken.”</p><p>Rio was furious and Agatha had a churning need to agitate her further. She turned, making sure to keep her back from pressing against the wall, and leaned too close.</p><p>“I was right, wasn’t I?” She chuckled mockingly. “Let’s not get all hot and bothered over could-have-beens.” Agatha grinned through clenched teeth as she caught sight of the Chief. Rio’s hand on her wrist tightened and Agatha whispered against her ear. “Don’t let Koutsou see you like this. You can’t have her questioning your integrity.”</p><p>Rio stepped back a proper distance, her dark brown eyes nearly black with fury and something obsidian, something molten.</p><p>The Chief caught sight of Agatha then, her eyes widening as she called the newly-arriving medics in her direction.</p><p>Koutsou followed behind them as they got to Agatha and she sat through the same checks Rio had already made; the prodding at her bruised ribs, the locating of the piece of wood lodged in her back.</p><p>Koutsou gave Agatha a disbelieving look mired in respect.</p><p>“You’re a lunatic.”</p><p>Agatha laughed then, her head dropping against the wall as the medics cut around her impalement.</p><p>“I’m touched.”</p><p>One of the medics motioned to the exit.</p><p>“It’s not deep but it’ll be a real bitch to remove. Let’s get you to the ambulance.”</p><p>Agatha offered a salute to Rio, to the Chief, and let herself be led away.</p><p>______________</p><p>Agatha sat fully patched up on the edge of a hospital bed. She had bandages on her arms and was told in no uncertain terms that she was incredibly lucky that her injuries weren’t worse. She’d gotten stitches in her back and the area was still numb even though she’d been waiting here for nearly two hours.</p><p>Her clothes were horribly uncomfortable as she sat in her dried sweat and blood but she’d refused to put on a gown. Doctors had offered her painkillers and she’d accepted happily.</p><p>She was nearly to the point of calling a taxi when Jen, of all people, stepped into the room.</p><p>“Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha looked past her and offered a bemused frown.</p><p>“Kale. You draw the short straw?”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes as she ushered Agatha from the room.</p><p>“You should be grateful, the others wanted you to stay for observation. Consider it my thanks for buying me some time to not get shot in the face.”</p><p>Agatha grumbled after her.</p><p>“If I’d known I was saving your life I wouldn’t have bothered.”</p><p>Jen led them to the elevator and pressed the button impatiently, not deigning Agatha with a response. The ride down and the walk to the exit were silent. Agatha found it irritating.</p><p>She’d had far too much time to think already. Once the nurses had left her she had let herself live through her actions again. The screech of adrenaline in her veins, the sound of the glass shattering around her, the impact of the metal bar through the thick Kevlar. The sensations were fresh, the taste of the air in the warehouse easy to recall. Her inability to breathe, Rio looking for her. Rio’s relief. Her hands. The harsh touches. Her anger.</p><p>Agatha saw the look Rio gave her on repeat, the heat of it stamped behind her eyes and coiling low in her belly.</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek to stop the path her mind veered down. She focused on the stinging hurt in her back and arms as they walked out of the building.</p><p>Jen climbed into a waiting SUV and closed the door in Agatha’s face. It was a relief, a new focus.</p><p>She rounded the vehicle, let herself inside, and shot Jen a look.</p><p>“Bitter gratitude is a good look for you, Kale.”</p><p>Jen mimicked her tone.</p><p>“And suffocation fits you well.”</p><p>Agatha snickered. This was good. She needed this.</p><p>“I’m surprised you could see my heroic effort from where you were cowered with the Captain.”</p><p>Jen huffed.</p><p>“Oh, it was more than seen. There were cameras all over that building. Not to mention the body cam footage.” Jen smirked. “You should see your face when you hit that railing; you looked like a pug.”</p><p>Agatha very much wanted to see that footage.</p><p>“All in a day’s work.”</p><p>Jen stretched out her legs and they sat quietly for several minutes. Her next comment seemed to come out of nowhere.</p><p>“That was my first time working with Vidal. She’s intense about her people.” Jen shrugged. “I guess that’s what you want from your boss though.”</p><p>Agatha’s breathing went shallow.</p><p>“How do you mean?”</p><p>Jennifer looked out the window as they rolled to a stop.</p><p>“She was about to smash heads together. You weren’t responding, classic attention-seeker that you are, and she got real snappy.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. Despite her harrowing dance with severe injury, she thought she might crawl out of her skin with the way her body was humming with unspent energy.</p><p>“What a bitch.”</p><p>Jen snorted, her attention returning to Agatha.</p><p>“Do you have a pleasant bone in your body or were you born an asshole?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, pretending to think.</p><p>“There was this one time– oh, no.” She tilted her head back and forth and offered a shrug. “Can’t think of anything off the top of my head.”</p><p>Jen huffed.</p><p>“Yeah, sounds about right.”</p><p>They remained quiet for the remainder of the ride and Agatha opened her door before the vehicle rolled to a stop at the ROC.</p><p>_______</p><p>As soon as Agatha stepped into the command center, two dozen eyes fell to her. The gathered Constables and the small team they’d been working with directly, her own team at the back. Everyone was covered in a thin film of dirt. Some sported bruises and cuts, others looked relatively unharmed.</p><p>The Chief was front and center, clearly finishing her debrief.</p><p>“Agent Harkness. Woman of the hour. I have a mountain of paperwork for the stun grenades you borrowed from my Constable.”</p><p>Agatha winced, holding her hand out limply.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Chief, I think my hand was broken in the fall.”</p><p>A round of chuckles sounded from the room and Agatha tried not to stand taller. This was a far cry from the general attitude toward her just hours before.</p><p>The Chief nodded toward the back where her team was gathered.</p><p>“Dictation is an option. Please have a seat. We’ll finish here soon.”</p><p>Agatha walked toward her team, all of them watching her approach with varying expressions. Lilia’s was curious, Alice’s was impressed, Wanda’s was concerned. Agatha focused on William, ignoring Rio beside him.</p><p>She sat on his other side.</p><p>He immediately leaned over, whispering emphatically.</p><p>“That was totally nuts.”</p><p>Agatha looked toward the computer in front of him.</p><p>“You have the footage?”</p><p>William nodded, turning it toward her to reveal multiple angles of her suicidal jump through single pane glass. It played out far quicker than it had felt in the moment, her body hitting the metal, her wide, pained expression, her hand unclipping the flashbangs from her belt and flinging them across the open space.</p><p>The camera warbled and gray dots covered the screens as the expulsion knocked into them. Only two of five remained in position after the video returned, the other three aiming directly at the floor. The only camera that remained on her slumped form was darkened, the picture corrupted.</p><p>It continued to play as William leaned toward her.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>She waved him off, the cuts on her arms tugging painfully.</p><p>“Peachy.”</p><p>The briefing continued. Agatha learned that the other teams had moved in on the sport’s facility and Veridi’s private home. Georgina had been found locked away in the subfloor of the barn. She was hospitalized but word had already come through that she would be completely okay; at least in the physical sense. It seemed that Veridi’s people had discovered who she was a few days after the abduction. She’d been brought and kept at his private home in hopes that the search would dissipate and a ransom could be requested.</p><p>She was malnourished and sleep deprived but otherwise unharmed. Agatha breathed a sigh of relief and looked toward William.</p><p>The videos on the screen were still running, the busy dock packed with activity, but his eyes were narrowed in on the darkened edge of a particular one. Agatha’s heart lurched in her throat as she saw how closely Rio was standing to her, the intimacy of the position made worse by the fact that it was <i>not</i> obvious that she was being checked for injuries.</p><p>William leaned in closer, head tilted, brows drawn, when Rio’s hand reached over and closed the computer screen with a snap.</p><p>William’s cheeks reddened a dark shade, his eyes very carefully locked onto the surface of desk in front of him. Agatha didn’t look at Rio, Rio didn’t look at Agatha, and William barely moved for the remainder of the post-op brief.</p><p>__________</p><p>The team arrived back at the consulate house two hours later. The long days leading up to such an explosive conclusion had drained them. As they walked in, Lilia pointed to the kitchen, looking specifically at Agatha.</p><p>“Wine.”</p><p>Agatha thought of her empty room waiting for her, about the unsettled energy still coursing under her skin, and easily followed into the kitchen.</p><p>In the flurry of opening cabinets for glasses and wine, Wanda pulled Agatha aside with a soft touch at her wrist.</p><p>“Are you alright, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha was fine. Truly. It had been the most excitement she’d experienced in ages. A few bumps and bruises were part of the job. But her mind… it replayed the damaged footage over and over in her head. It drew to the forefront the weight of Rio’s hands on her, the look in her eyes as her stony facade began to crumble from her fury, the threat that sat behind it. She accepted a glass from Lilia as it was pressed into her hand, raising her brows at Wanda and offering a thumbs up.</p><p>Wanda frowned, searching her expression until she was gifted her own glass. Even William had a glass shoved into his grasp and Lilia held up a hand before Wanda could speak.</p><p>“It’s Europe, Maximoff. Let the kid live a little.”</p><p>Agatha bit back her amusement as William took the glass easily, like he’d held one every weekend for years. Bookclub, probably. Or puzzle nights with his boyfriend.</p><p>Lilia held up her glass toward Agatha.</p><p>“To this bat-shit crazy bitch. And to finally going home.”</p><p>The team pressed their glasses together and drank.</p><p>Alice tapped her fingers against her glass.</p><p>“On the scale of things I’ve seen in this job, jumping at full speed through a window is up there with some of the most reckless.”</p><p>Agatha feigned a haughty bow, warmth spreading in her chest at the good-humored cheers.</p><p>“At your service.”</p><p>She looked up just in time to see Rio leave the room.</p><p>Jen glanced behind, brows raised, before she took Rio’s untouched glass from the counter and finished it herself.</p><p>“Don’t mind if I do.”</p><p>The others moved on quickly, only Wanda looking after Rio’s departure.</p><p>And William. He stared with a ponderous frown at the empty archway, then his eyes fell back to Agatha. To the arch. To Agatha. They widened.</p><p>Agatha reached over and lifted the bottom of his glass, nearly splashing his wine into his face.</p><p>“Drink up, intern. Once we’re in international airspace, Maximoff’s rules reapply.”</p><p>_____________</p><p>Agatha showered as best she could without soaking through her bandages. She used a cloth to brush away the grime and dried blood in hopes that it would erase the day entirely from her mind.</p><p>It did not.</p><p>Her body ached in so many ways that she was surprised the one at her core kept taking precedence. She sat in a towel on her bed, a golden buzz from the wine running through her blood, and looked down at the stark white bandages on her arms. Most of the scratches she’d received were superficial, two or three deep enough to warrant attention. She flexed her fingers and bit her lip, then laid back against the sheets.</p><p>Adrenaline always had a way of bringing Agatha’s hand between her own legs. Today was no different.</p><p>She slid her fingers through her damp folds, against her clit, hopeful, and groaned as it produced a dull, unsatisfying pleasure that faded almost as soon as it began. She pressed harder and a frustrated whine passed through her lips.</p><p>She quickly withdrew her hand and dropped her arm over her eyes, her chest heaving a harsh breath in the warm lamplight of her room. Agatha shook her head, swallowing her agitation, and tried to force the desire for release out of her mind.</p><p>Instead, memories shoved into her skull. Rio’s knee, warm against hers. The challenge in her eyes. The easy way she had spoken about taking Agatha apart.</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth as a slight adjustment of her legs sent a jolt through her. She rolled carefully out of bed. She was far too sensitive at the moment, everywhere her skin touched the sheets felt like live wires. Her throat was parched.</p><p>Agatha tugged on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt before heading toward the stairwell.</p><p>Her bare feet padded against the cold floor as she made her way down the quiet steps, her body aching furiously with every step. She was too hot, too frustrated, and she desperately needed to cool down before she did something stupid like playing a game of peek-a-boo to find Rio’s room.</p><p>She reached the landing and headed for the kitchen to pour herself a glass of water.</p><p>As she passed the living room, a single light on inside, she slowed, stopped. Her heartbeat pounded irregularly in her chest, her mouth watered.</p><p>Rio was sitting in an armchair, still wearing her black slacks though they were wrinkled at the backs of her knees and covered in dirt at the front. Her feet were kicked up and crossed on the coffee table, the black soles of her shoes aimed toward Agatha. She’d cleaned her face, a butterfly bandage placed on her temple where an angry bruise sat.</p><p>There was a beer in her hand, the condensation only marred by the path of her fingers.</p><p>She still wore her button-down– the white of it colored by dirt– as it sat open against the ribbed tank covering her chest.</p><p>Another beer sat untouched on a coaster in front of the couch, droplets slipping down, pooling on the ceramic.</p><p>Agatha stared because she couldn’t do anything else. Her chest had tightened violently, disrupting the functions of her remaining organs.</p><p>Rio’s eyes lifted from her phone screen, the low light glowing against her cheeks and jaw, and Agatha was caught. She felt the webbing wrap around her wrists and waist and thighs, the coil tight and unforgiving as she waited to be devoured.</p><p>Rio didn’t move, didn’t speak, just watched as Agatha walked into the room and lowered herself onto the sofa.</p><p>Agatha pulled the beer to her chest, the condensation staining her t-shirt and the coldness near-sizzling against her skin beneath.</p><p>She tried to muster up even a mild modicum of disgust.</p><p>“I think you’re forgetting that desperation isn’t always pretty, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled up, her eyes heavy on Agatha.</p><p>“What about predictability?” Rio leaned forward, forearms on her knees as she watched Agatha take a drink. “Is it desperation to prepare for an inevitability?”</p><p>Agatha’s overheated thighs were soothed momentarily against the cool fabric of the couch. She took another large pull from the beer, the mild relief sizzling away under Rio’s gaze. She saw the way Rio’s fingers were wrapped around the bottle, the way they tightened against the glass. Her eyes tracked them.</p><p>Agatha didn’t have words to deny it, didn’t have an excuse that wouldn't eventually take them to the truth.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem to need it. Her eyes were coals in the dim light, her voice low velvet to Agatha’s ears.</p><p>“The rush of a fight always seems to sit,” Rio reached toward her, free hand outstretched to touch Agatha’s sternum lightly, “right here.” Rio stared at the point of connection like she was in a trance. “It eddies in you, completely out of your control.” Her two fingers traced down, between the valley of Agatha’s chest to her belly. “And finds it way low.”</p><p>Agatha ground her teeth tightly enough to hurt, her lungs starved for oxygen as she felt Rio’s fingers like a brand. Her core clenched desperately and she quickly gripped Rio’s wrist in a bone-grinding hold to drag it away.</p><p>
<i>“Stop.”</i>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes drifted up, the black in them challenging, calling like a siren. Despite the force behind Agatha’s grip, Rio didn’t flinch.</p><p>“Tell me it doesn’t drive you mad. When it’s your hand instead of mine between your thighs.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were locked onto the sensual line of Rio’s mouth, the taunting tug of her smile as she spoke degradation like a promise.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, her lips parting, her eyes closing. The stubbornness that sat proudly in her body was being subdued by filthy words and she couldn’t find it in herself to free it. One time. One time and she’d find release. One time and she’d be so disgusted with herself that she would never allow it to happen again.</p><p>She released Rio’s wrist and the hand fell to her bare thigh, the palm searing against her skin, fingers splaying, nails digging in.</p><p>She heard Rio move, heard the sound of a bottle against the table, the thud of weight against the rug on the wooden floors. She felt ribs against the insides of her knees as Rio knelt between them, her other hand settling at the expanse of skin beneath Agatha’s shorts.</p><p>Agatha’s head dropped back slowly, her mind clamoring at her to run, to strike, to scream. Its efforts were drowned out by the sound of her heartbeat in her ears, pattering its need against her eardrums.</p><p>Heat radiated off of Rio as her fingertips slid up the soft skin of Agatha’s inner thighs and beneath her shorts. They slowed as they neared the crux of her hips and wrapped around the outside to grasp her ass.</p><p>Rio gave no warning before she yanked Agatha toward herself, their bodies melding.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot open in time to find Rio looking up at her. It felt too much like worship, too much like care.</p><p>She reached forward and gripped Rio’s jaw in her hand roughly, the muscles in her arm protesting.</p><p>“I thought I was the one that was meant to beg.”</p><p>Rio’s control snapped.</p><p>She surged from the floor, hand against Agatha’s chest to shove her backward as she captured her mouth in a brutal kiss. Her hand circled Agatha’s neck, squeezing the sides, as she knelt over one of Agatha’s thighs. Her knee pressed tightly against Agatha’s core.</p><p>The kiss was as harsh and devastating as Agatha wanted it. She let Rio consume her, control her, take her mouth with sharp teeth and a demanding tongue. She moaned against the force of her, lifted her chest so that her airway was further restricted as the coiling heat in her belly expanded and sank low.</p><p>She ground against the muscle of Rio’s leg, her shorts ruined as they bunched and dragged through her slick. Rio pressed her leg tighter as she withdrew from the kiss. She was above Agatha now, her hands going to rest on the couch on either side of her head.</p><p>Rio watched, expression laced with power, as Agatha ground herself against her leg.</p><p>Agatga’s hands had fallen instinctively onto Rio’s waist against the tank top. She tried to drag her closer but Rio gave her nothing.</p><p>Rio watched with a wicked sort of knowing as Agatha tried to find the right amount of friction  and couldn’t.</p><p>Agatha’s movement slowed as the embarrassment threatened to choke her and she let her stuttering hips settle, her eyes blazing into Rio’s. She was wound so tightly, relief so close in her grasp, that her words felt like they were ripped from her throat.</p><p>“Is this fun for you?”</p><p>Rio’s leg drew back, the pressure ceasing, and Agatha bit back a whimper. Rio looked too put together even with the way she was panting, her shirt hanging open.</p><p>Rio slowly stood.</p><p>“Come here, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha glowered. She felt the command in her bones, felt it sing through her blood. She stood, her hips and chest nudging Rio’s.</p><p>Rio tilted her head toward the entrance</p><p>“Make a decision now, sweetheart.” Agatha’s chest squeezed and Rio’s fingers played with the hem of her shorts. “Stay and I’ll do exactly what I want to you. You’ll let me <i>knowing</i> that I am not going to allow you to come tonight,” Rio’s nails scratched into the sensitive skin of her hips. “Or leave. Go back to bed and try again and again to elicit the same feelings in yourself that you know I can.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. This wasn’t a part of the plan. It left loose ends, fraying ends, for Rio to yank and pull at her pleasure. It meant Agatha would lose and she wouldn’t get what she’d been craving for the past week. It meant Rio was still in control.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, her lungs burning as she turned to leave. Every step reminded her of the wet ache between her legs, the pulsing of her clit, the desperation in her body. She stilled as she reached the entrance, her legs betraying her, her mouth answering only in a defeated sigh.</p><p>She heard Rio’s approach like an executioner, felt Rio’s hand on her hip like a blade at her neck.</p><p>Rio pushed, maneuvered her to the closest wall and pressed her chest against the hard, cold wood. She let her hands roam, taking her time on Agatha’s stomach and the notch of her ribs. Rio’s hands slid up to Agatha’s chest and squeezed.</p><p>Rio’s forehead pressed into Agatha’s spine and she caught a nipple between two fingers, pinching lightly.</p><p>Agatha’s hips jerked, her head dropping between her arms where they held her up.</p><p>“Rio–”</p><p>Rio hummed, one hand remaining in place to torture and tease as the other fell lower and dug into the divot of Agatha’s hip.</p><p>“I told you I would make you beg for it, didn’t I?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, mouth parted as she panted. Every muscle in her body was tense with anticipation.</p><p>Rio’s fingers slid under the waist of her shorts, tangling briefly in the short hairs there and withdrawing before she got anywhere of substance. She rubbed soothingly along Agatha’s lower abdomen but it buzzed through Agatha’s body like a threat.</p><p>“I’m glad you remember.” Rio’s head lifted from her back, the hand on Agatha’s chest sliding up to her throat and holding her in place. “I wouldn’t want you to be confused.”</p><p>Rio’s hand slid back beneath Agatha’s shorts and she didn’t slow to tease as her hand cupped Agatha’s cunt. She breathed out a gasp in her ear.</p><p>“If I had my strap, I would take you over,” Rio’s hips rolled into Agatha, pressing them both against the wall, “and over,” Rio’s fingers slipped through her, “and over.” She coated her fingers in Agatha’s slick. “I wouldn’t make you wait to come undone.”</p><p>Agatha wanted something to hold onto, her vision fuzzy as she pressed her neck further into Rio’s hand. Her legs nearly gave as Rio’s fingers paused just outside of her entrance with a light pressure. It felt too good, too right for Rio’s hands to be on her again. She tried to push her hips back, to take Rio’s fingers, but Rio moved easily with her.</p><p>Rio tssked at her neck, her hand applying enough pressure to cut off Agatha’s airway entirely for just a moment. She let the fingers on Agatha’s cunt roll over her clit, the motion barely providing any friction.</p><p>“God, you’re <i>nothing</i> without my hands on you. I–”</p><p>Rio’s next words were cut off by the sound of footsteps on the floor above.</p><p>Agatha stilled, her body wailing at the knowledge that this was over before she could force Rio’s hand, could chase the high her body had been searching for.</p><p>Instead of withdrawing, Rio’s hand stayed buried in her shorts. She used her other hand to grip Agatha’s hip and turn her, to push her back into the wall. She flipped off the lights to their right, shrouding the room in darkness.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened and she met Rio’s eyes and whispered harshly.</p><p>“Don’t you fucking da–”</p><p>Rio’s fingers slid inside her.</p><p>Agatha’s head nearly slammed into the wall, her body arching, but Rio’s hand slid into her hair and cushioned the blow. Rio’s fingers tightened sharply in her hair and a surprised whine left Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Rio shot her a deadly look.</p><p>“Quiet.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to strangle her. Instead, she bit her lip sharply as Rio’s fingers withdrew and thrust back inside, the gasp still too loud as the footsteps started down the steps.</p><p>Rio’s hand released her hair and pressed tightly over her mouth as she continued to drive into her, the pace so much faster than Agatha was prepared for. There was nothing she could do as delirium overwrote her logic, her base instincts taking over. She didn’t even have to meet the thrusts as Rio’s pace hit her perfectly, over and over, fingers curling, spreading.</p><p>Agatha felt the fast wind, the curl of her toes against the wood, the pressure building sharp in her belly.</p><p>Rio slowed minutely as the footsteps landed on the first floor just feet away from the living room but she didn’t stop.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach clenched, her hips jerking out of her control, even as the footsteps began to close in. She could hardly focus on the fact that this was appalling behavior, that they had no right to be taking such a risk.</p><p>The footsteps walked past them toward the kitchen and Agatha let out a huff against Rio’s hand.</p><p>Rio’s pace began to pick up as soon as quiet clatters sounded. A cupboard was opened, then the sink began to run.</p><p>Rio added a third finger and Agatha couldn’t stop the broken moan that came out muffled from her mouth and reverberated against Rio’s heated palm. Rio’s eyes blazed into hers, a warning, but Agatha felt nearly mindless.</p><p>She was so close. So fucking close and she didn’t give a fuck if she woke the entire household. It would be Rio’s neck on the line, not hers.</p><p>But Rio knew exactly what she needed and she didn’t give it to her. She was avoiding her clit purposefully, keeping her right on the edge.</p><p>If Agatha could move her hips <i>just right</i>. . . She twisted on Rio’s next thrust, dropping her hips enough that the heel of Rio’s hand grazed her clit.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth fell open against Rio’s hand, her back arched off of the wall, and her eyes nearly rolled into the back of her skull as her orgasm began to rip through her.</p><p>Without hesitation, Rio withdrew her hand, cutting the orgasm painfully short. It sparked and died like an ember too far from the fire.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot open, her body shaking, eyes watering in frustration.</p><p>Rio’s hand on her mouth stayed in place and she pressed close as the footsteps made their way back toward the stairs.</p><p>Agatha trembled despite her attempts to regain her composure. She squeezed her legs together, the disappointment like a weight in her chest.</p><p>The footsteps echoed up the steps and as soon as they heard the thunk of a door closing, Rio stepped back. The hand on Agatha’s mouth slid up, pushed her damp bangs from her face.</p><p>Rio’s eyes burned with irritation and desire and a well-stroked ego.</p><p>“You just couldn’t be patient and take what I gave you.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, fought the urge to lean into the palm on her cheek. She was utterly ruined, wrecked. She wanted to cry at the pit in her stomach, the broken-off release.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s hand on her cheek slid down to grasp Agatha’s jaw. She pressed her lips against Agatha’s throat and hummed her response.</p><p>Agatha swallowed a whine.</p><p>“Rio. Please.”</p><p>Rio smiled into her throat, caught her ear with her teeth, then stepped away.</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha.”</p>

<p>Agatha was the last from her room– team breakfast avoided, and the last to stuff her suitcase into one of two waiting SUVs outside. She had her sunglasses shoved over her eyes as she walked into the post-dawn light and headed toward their waiting jet. The team was still half-asleep, quiet, but Lilia motioned toward her and laughed.</p><p>“Another party before a flight?”</p><p>It was an innocent callback to a conversation from nearly a month prior, but memories from the previous night drummed through Agatha’s skull. Rio was boarding with them, walking beside Wanda just two steps back.</p><p>“I didn’t sleep well. Scratchy sheets.”</p><p>The statement was clipped, an unspoken request for the topic to be dropped.</p><p>William pitched in and Agatha was on the verge of relegating him back to intern status permanently.</p><p>“Really? I looked up the brand and ordered them the first night we stayed here.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice rose mockingly.</p><p>“Oh, did you?”</p><p>William looked like he was going to respond and Agatha increased her pace, reaching the stairs. She climbed inside before she was forced to converse about thread count while the sensations of Rio inside her after five years was playing on repeat in her body. Agatha chose a seat in the back this time, hoping her foul mood would repel any more attempts at conversation.</p><p>To her dismay and relief, Wanda was the one to claim the chair beside her. She looked tired but excited, a light in her eyes as they settled in for their lengthy flight back to DC and back to her family.</p><p>Agatha was happy for her.</p><p>She frowned at the sentiment and then ignored it entirely. Rio, being the horrific devil that she was, sat in the seat directly in front of Agatha, the top of her head just visible over the tan leather. Agatha wondered if she’d be fired if she dumped one of the complimentary water bottles over her hair.</p><p>She crossed her arms, face turned toward the window and the slowly-rising sun.</p><p>The flight was somehow far more arduous in their return. Seconds took minutes and minutes took hours to pass by while conversations crested and fell silent, repeated. Wanda had given Agatha the first several hours in peace, her own attention fastened to the small book in her lap. She could see the top of the bookmark; a note from Vision: <i>”If the journey’s end is an understanding of one's soul, how then–</i> Pretentious motherfucker.</p><p>Agatha tried to sleep. She was exhausted. Her night after Rio’s malicious power play had been filled with heavy, unwanted thoughts and an unfulfilling orgasm. She’d already disparaged herself once, and so she had let her imagination run wild with thoughts of Rio and her clever mouth. It had gotten her to the finish line but the victory was sour, the accomplishment empty. She’d lain awake, staring at the same black dot on the ceiling, until her body shut down of its own volition.</p><p>Her eyes slipped shut, the whirring cogs in her brain settling, providing a tentative, cloudy warmth. She was seconds from rest when she felt movement in front of her. Her eyes pried open and she saw Rio’s arm tossed lazily over her head, her hand resting on the leather, fingers gripping lightly.</p><p>It wasn’t abnormal, didn’t look out of place, but Agatha <i>knew</i>. Rio’s middle and index fingers began drawing senseless patterns and Agatha’s abdomen clenched.</p><p>She turned away, seething, the almost-escape of unconsciousness an impossible path for her now. She crossed her legs to keep them still and ignored the taunt for its duration.</p><p>Rio had always been better at persistence, at patience. It had been the source of many arguments in their early relationship. The virtues became sins when wielded like a blade; when they turned to stubbornness and avoidance.</p><p>
<i>Agatha stewed. She ate a bowl of pistachio ice cream, disgusted that it was all she had in her freezer– fucking Rio–  and stewed some more. She tried to parse through her own agitation and groaned loudly, dropping her bowl and spoon loudly against the coffee table.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was one comment. She hadn’t meant it. She was just… she’d been in a terrible mood and Rio had caught her at the crux of it. Her mother had called her just after she’d closed a particularly rough case. Improperly documented evidence, a bunch of finger pointing, a criminal receiving a far-reduced sentence for a heinous crime because of a missing signature. It hadn’t been her fault, it had been some arrogant Agent from the class before hers, but the injustice of it all sat like oil in her lungs.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Seeing <i>Mother</i> pop up on her screen as she’d gotten in the elevator had set that oil ablaze. The conversation hadn’t lasted longer than the length of the ride but it had done the damage. <i>”Any job that requires you to miss church is sinful, Agatha. You have an obligation.”</i></i>
</p><p>
<i>Far be it from her to remind her mother once more that, not only was she a raging lesbian, she was also an atheist.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d walked out of WFO to find Rio standing there so expectantly, so at ease. She always seemed so careless and it made Agatha bitter with jealousy.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do we have plans I forgot about?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes had narrowed, had picked up the sharpness of her tone.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No.” She paused, searching. “I thought we could go to that new bar around the corner.” Her lips had curled up hopefully. “We need a replacement for Post Pub. They’ve got four-dollar PBRs on Thursday nights.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s black mood had suffocated the adoration that reared its head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I can’t.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had frowned, eyes laced with concern.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha, is something wrong?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had lashed out. In that moment, she could think of nothing worse than being known.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why does something need to be wrong for me to want time alone? Jesus, Vidal, get a life.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s face had smoothed out, the concern in her eyes vanishing. She’d looked like a waxen figure as she’d nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Got it. Enjoy your alone time.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The regret had been instant and debilitating and still, Agatha hadn’t stopped her when she walked away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>That was five days prior and Rio had yet to text or call. She hadn’t been waiting for Agatha outside the office after work, nor had she gone to the weekly trivia night that their remaining class tried to make.</i>
</p><p>
<i>And no, Agatha hadn’t technically apologized, but Rio hadn’t given her a chance.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They were just a month into this tentative, fragile thing and Agatha had treated it so carelessly. And Rio… was it really so easy for her to walk away? The thought made Agatha’s gut churn. How pathetic was she to think Rio might want her in the same, desperate, heart-rending way that Agatha wanted her?</i>
</p><p>
<i>She had almost gone over to Rio’s apartment every day after work but she was stopped by the acidic fear that she wouldn’t be wanted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Today was the last day that she’d be able to do it. Rio was moving out of her tiny studio tomorrow. She’d told Agatha just two weeks prior, her eyes alight with excitement as she talked about the fact that it had three separate spaces with their own purposes instead of the one tiny little room split into a cramped kitchen and bedroom. They’d spent hours next to one another in that bedroom searching for cheap furniture and kitchen supplies, growing bolder with their touches, until Agatha had tossed both of their phones to the floor and crawled on top of her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was often Agatha that initiated touches outside of sex; even after they’d grown comfortable laying bare beside one another, bodies spent and satisfied. Rio was still a mystery to her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She was bold and sly and confident and odd. She told Agatha what she felt with little prompting but kept her hands to herself unless she was aiming to drive Agatha mad. She pursued closeness but didn’t probe deeper into any kind of sensitive topic. And she watched Agatha, studied her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had gotten to a point where she could feel Rio’s eyes on her. It was different to the hunger in her gaze before they fucked. It was different to the pleased little look that sat in her expression when they found time to just be. It was a quiet look. A pensive look. It held layers of emotion Agatha couldn’t touch or taste yet, no matter how much she craved to.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stood from the ugly, brown couch she’d gotten from her mother as a bribe to go to the Christmas service with her the year before. She couldn’t wait to burn it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha grabbed her keys and quickly took the three flights of steps to the ground floor of her apartment. She walked for ten minutes trying to find where she’d parked her car, angry words muttered as she turned corner after corner. She finally remembered when she’d walked three blocks in the wrong direction and she nearly screamed as she turned around to backtrack.</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time she’d climbed into her shitbox car she was sweating and far more irritable than she’d been when she’d left. It helped burn off her anxieties of the impending confrontation, the worry that Rio would send her away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She drove the ten minutes to Rio’s place and spent another ten just trying to find parking. By the time she swung her car into the tightest spot known to man, Agatha was ready to bash her head into the steering wheel. She flung herself out of her car and stalked toward Rio’s door with words simmering, building up behind her lips. Because yeah, she’d been a bitch. But Rio had another fucking thing coming if she thought she could just ghost her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha reached Rio’s first floor apartment and bashed her hand into the purple-brown door with a crooked ‘6’ hanging from it. When Rio didn’t answer immediately, she knocked again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She was ready to waylay her with some choice, carefully selected arguments.</i>
</p><p>
<i>And then the door opened. And Rio was there with baggy sweats and one of Agatha’s t-shirts hanging partly off of one shoulder. Her eyes were red but dry and they widened in a visceral, real surprise. It was like getting punched in the kidney, a knockout blow parading around like it might not hurt until you were curled into yourself on the floor ready to vomit.</i>
</p><p>
<i>All of Agatha’s words faded, her heart clenching.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You didn’t answer my texts.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s shock was shoveled under a layer of dismissal but Agatha had seen it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Your texts? You asked if we could talk. Once.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shifted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I called.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s lips curled into a bitter smile.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What do you want to say, Agatha?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was stonewalling her. She was seconds away from turning Agatha away like she’d been so afraid of.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But Agatha could still see the puffy rings around her eyes even if they were blank now.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stepped toward her but stilled as Rio mirrored her movement backward.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Can I come inside? Please.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She could see that Rio wanted to say no. She didn’t. Or couldn’t.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio turned around and walked into her slim excuse for a kitchen. She had a pot on the stove and Agatha absently tried to figure out if she was just using the noodles from the ramen sitting dry on the counter or if the many ingredients beside it were being added with the flavor pack.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stuck the ramen in not-yet-boiling water, her shoulders drawn up, her head lowered as if it took far more concentration than it did.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s guilt sat heavy on her breastbone.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tensed and forced her shoulders down. She did not set a timer as she turned around and met Agatha’s eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>This was a new look. Or lack of a look, really. It was like Rio was staring past her and she hated it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I didn’t mean to snap at you like that. Outside the WFO. I was having–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio waved her hand dismissively.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s fine, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s hands clenched, agitation bubbling.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s clearly not true because I haven’t seen you for five fucking days and we work at the same place.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shrugged.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ve been busy.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pressed her hands to her face and sucked in a breath, her chest rising and falling several times before she dragged her hands down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you want me to go? Am I wasting my time; embarrassing myself?” Agatha saw the briefest flicker of <i>something</i> in Rio’s face but couldn’t place it. She felt like crying. She closed her eyes and sagged. “God, I’m an idiot. I’m sorry. That’s what I came to say.” She offered a pained smile. “And I’m sorry for coming here. I didn’t– I thought–” Agatha heard the waver in her voice and hated herself. “It doesn’t matter what I thought.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She turned away from the kitchen and her eyes went blurry with tears as she grasped the door handle. The wrongness of it ending this way clawed at her as she tugged the handle up and twisted left, the specific motions needed to get the damn thing to budge.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She heard movement and she wasn’t going to look. She just needed to leave before Rio saw her fall to pieces.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s voice stilled her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I thought you were going to end things.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha closed the door slightly, stared at the many layers of paint that covered its splintered wood.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio moved closer and reached in front of her, closing the door the rest of the way.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“When you texted me that, I thought you were done with me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She looked to Rio, standing there so soft in Agatha’s clothes. She had dropped the mask but she was looking away, her jaw tight like this was one of the hardest things she’d ever done.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha leaned her shoulder against the door and stared.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“After one shitty comment?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio bristled, her pretty brown eyes glittering.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She cut herself off, her teeth clamped together as she breathed through them.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had never seen her like this. Cracking open, emotional. She was desperate for the reveal.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I what?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes burned into hers as tears filled them. She suddenly looked so small.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was heart wrenching to see on her face. Sadness didn’t belong there. Agatha let go of her remaining reservations and reached for Rio, hand curving around her cheek, thumb brushing under her eye. Her other hand caught Rio’s chin as she tried to look down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I what, baby?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s face crumpled and Agatha pulled her into her chest, hand pressed into the back of her head. Rio’s hands clung to her shoulders.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She wasn’t sure how long they stood there, the embrace so warm and encompassing that Agatha was content to die like this if that’s what Rio needed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Finally, Rio pulled back. She wiped at her freshly red eyes grumpily and frowned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m sorry.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s brows furrowed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What? Why?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio cleared her throat, eyes averted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I didn’t mean to cry all over your sweatshirt.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>A piece of Rio clicked into place for Agatha at that moment. She didn’t understand it, didn’t know its origins, but she would never, ever leave Rio to wonder if she’d been left behind again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stepped forward and kissed her then. Touches like this had always been so much easier for them. Even before they’d decided to date, when their sex had been a means of release, a bit of fun after long, stressful days of training. They’d danced around the emotional part, the words of it, for months before Agatha got jealous.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d seen Rio with a girl from their class, the stupid redhead Agatha had possibly, maybe slept with one time within a week of training starting. They’d been drunk and exhausted and she’d been fun, freakier than Agatha had expected. They’d been cordial since.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But seeing her sitting next to Rio on a bar stool, their thighs touching slightly as they laughed with beers in hand, a deep, withering pitch had pooled in Agatha’s chest. The next hour was a blur. Agatha had sat in the group of really loud men in her class and helped them polish off four pitchers of beer before Rio had even taken notice of her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d waved, a smirk on her face, her coat on like she was about to leave, and Agatha hadn’t been able to look away. She’d stared at the slow look of bemusement that overtook Rio’s face, watched her lips curve down, her brow furrow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had stood, dropped a ten on the table, and strode across the bar toward Rio. She hadn’t said hello, hadn’t acknowledged the redhead’s friendly smile. Willa or Whitney or Wendy could absolutely fuck off. She’d taken Rio’s hand and dragged her toward the exit without explanation and Rio had followed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio hadn’t spoken until they were outside.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had let her hand go, had let the chilly air around them drag her drunk mind into focus.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I want you to fuck me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes had widened slightly, her confusion still apparent even as the words took their toll.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yeah. Okay.” She’d tilted her head. “We fuck all the time. We fucked this morning, technically.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had crossed her arms near-petulantly, frustration lacing her words.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Only me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s expression had cleared as she glanced back toward the bar like she understood. Her gaze fell on Agatha again, heated, certain.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay. Yeah.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had groaned, her fingers growing numb. She shoved them into her coat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Is that all you’re going to say?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had laughed and tilted her head in the direction of their dorms.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you want to start now or was this more for my future reference?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>It had taken them another several months to have a real conversation about it, but the sex that night had been so, so good.</i>
</p><p>Agatha faded back into reality with a sad, sick feeling in her stomach. Rio’s hand was still over the seat but her fingers were still and for a moment, Agatha considered if holding it would feel as right as being fucked by it.</p><p>She took a deep breath and turned to find Wanda watching her. Agatha frowned.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Wanda raised her brow, her voice low.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” She paused, her meaning clear, then added. “The injuries.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her arms even though her bandages were tucked away under her sweater. Her back was sore, achy and bruised, but she’d had so much worse.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Wanda nodded.</p><p>“Good. We’ll have a few days off when we get back so you’ll have time to recover before we jump headfirst into something new.”</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Is that required?”</p><p>Agatha saw Rio’s hand on the seat in front of her tense at the question.</p><p>Wanda pursed her lips.</p><p>“Yes, Agatha. It’s mandatory R&amp;R.”</p><p>Jen leaned into the aisle to look back, confusion written on it.</p><p>“Why would you not want a break, Harkness? We’ve been gone for weeks in a paradise and we weren’t even allowed to see the sights.”</p><p>Alice saved her from needing an answer immediately.</p><p>“I’m taking my bike down to Jacksonville for some better weather.”</p><p>William looked at her in awe.</p><p>“You would have a motorcycle. I’m so jealous.”</p><p>Lilia pointed a finger at him sternly.</p><p>“You are not allowed, William. They’re dangerous and Alice is an idiot for riding one of those death traps.”</p><p>Alice didn’t seem to take offense, instead nodding toward William.</p><p>“It’s true.”</p><p>William frowned, slightly put off, and lengthened his spine like that might work against the old bat.</p><p>“You can’t ban me from getting—“</p><p>Lilia’s eyes narrowed and William trailed off.</p><p>“Can’t I? I know a lot of people.”</p><p>William seemed mildly startled but a grin tugged at his lips.</p><p>“You’ll tell every DMV in America that I’m not to get my motorcycle license?”</p><p>Lilia shrugged.</p><p>“Easy.”</p><p>It rang true, even with the knowledge the team had regarding overreach of power and literal laws they were required to follow.</p><p>To Agatha’s surprise, William looked toward Wanda <i>and</i> Rio, imploring.</p><p>“She’s talking about committing crimes.”</p><p>Wanda’s face turned down, bemused.</p><p>“Oh, that’s— I must have misheard.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t see Rio’s face but her voice was light, amused.</p><p>“Lilia is allowed to break laws. It’s in her contract.”</p><p>Jen nodded.</p><p>“Actually, I believe that.”</p><p>William dropped his head into his hands for show.</p><p>Alice reached over and patted his back.</p><p>“It’s okay, Will, I’m sure Lilia’s ban wouldn’t include those fun little tricycles.”</p><p>William’s shoulders drooped further and he groaned, face-planting on the table in front of him.</p><p>Lilia laughed, eyes warm and smile big as she settled deeply into her seat.</p><p>“I’m getting a massage and sleeping for sixteen hours minimum.”</p><p>Jen groaned.</p><p>“God, that sounds good. I am being forced to go to my nephew’s seventh birthday. It’s an excuse for parents to stuff their kids in a bounce house and watch football for six hours.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced at that but didn’t interject in the conversation.</p><p>William had returned to his normal, joyful self and he smiled at Jen.</p><p>“My dad and boyfriend bonded over football early on when we started dating.” He laughed, sheepish. “Eddie told me almost a year in that he’d never watched a game in his life before that first time my dad had asked him if he’d ‘seen the game.’” William reached out in solidarity toward Jen. “Now I lose him to the streets for six to nine hours a week while they stuff wings in their mouths and scream.”</p><p>The team laughed and Agatha turned away to hide the start of a smile on her lips.</p><p>The conversation stayed in the vein of team sports for longer than Agatha could understand, but eventually, Alice turned the conversation forward.</p><p>“What about you, Wanda?”</p><p>It had been a gradual shift while they were in Athens, the lines of propriety blurring with familiarity, bonding. Agent Maximoff, boss, Maximoff; they’d all faded toward Wanda day by day.</p><p>Now, Wanda smiled.</p><p>“The National Christmas Tree lighting is this weekend and Vis and I are taking the boys. They’re letting the kids make ornaments this year and hang them on a smaller tree.”</p><p>Agatha breathed through the pang in her chest. She saw Rio’s hand on the seat above drop away.</p><p>The motion cracked her open, more revealing than anything Agatha had seen from Rio since she’d discovered Nicky’s blanket. For the first time in a very, very long time, Agatha’s mind recalled a long-suppressed memory.</p><p>
<i>”Do you think we should be doing this?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s face was pale, the circles under her eyes bruise-like. Her hair was flat, greasy against her skull as she finished cinching Nicky’s coat. She didn’t look at Agatha as she answered her question, her voice lifeless.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We might not get another chance.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Tears pressed into Agatha’s eyes as she stared at her son’s perfect little face, his skin nearly translucent, the veins behind his eyes too stark. He was wearing a fluffy, warm, purple hat that sat low on his forehead. Rage blackened Agatha’ next words to Rio, wrapped them in disgust.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Stop talking about him like he’s going to—“ her words cut off, her hands shaking. “Just stop.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked at her then, stood slowly from where she knelt in front of his stroller. She looked at Agatha with something far too close to pity and Agatha, for the first time in her life, hated her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“The doctor—“</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha snarled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t tell me what the doctor said! I know what he said.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio pulled back, her shoulders falling forward. This is how most of their conversations went now, how most of them ended. Agatha biting and clawing and tearing, and Rio retreating, disappearing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>This time, Rio held her ground. She moved away from Nicky’s stroller, voice low.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I want him to see it. It’s important to me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s face was dry and blotchy, her tears never seeming to stem for more than an hour or two. She saw Rio’s suffering through glass, she couldn’t feel it or hear it or know it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Well great, Rio. Let’s take our sick kid out in the cold, around hundreds of people, because it’s important to you.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes closed, her nostrils flaring as she worked through the emotions that surged through her. When she looked at Agatha, she looked like she might hate her too.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“He’s not sick, he’s dying. Wake up, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha stood as calmly as she was able, her throat closing, and walked toward the bathroom. She closed herself inside and nearly folded over, her hands curling around her abdomen and her jaw locked painfully tight to keep her sob from falling from her lips.</p><p>She stayed there for too long, trapped in the wailing grief that she couldn’t release. It felt so fresh, like she might open the door and find Nicky smiling so bright despite the efforts of his frail body, that she might find Rio, vacant eyes staring back at her, like she didn’t know her at all.</p><p>It hadn’t felt like this since she’d left. The wrenching, horrific fear, the pathetic hope that had curdled and died in her every day.</p><p>She turned on the water and splashed her face. Then she stood for far longer, waiting, seeking the apathy, the numbness. She’d just gathered herself enough to return when there was a knock on the door.</p><p>Agatha slipped the latch open to find Wanda there. The thin door to the rest of the jet had been closed and she was looking at Agatha like she might apologize.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t bear it. She shook her head quickly. She may have begrudged Wanda her happiness for years but nobody deserved to feel the way Agatha felt. Her heart knocked. The way Rio…</p><p>“No, it’s not— you should talk about your kids, Wanda. It’s okay.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes were sad, her mouth pressed in a thin line. She looked like she had so much to say but she didn’t. Instead, she reached for Agatha. She didn’t wait for confirmation or reciprocation, didn’t hesitate as her arms wrapped around Agatha’s shoulders and pulled her into her chest.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and let herself be held. Even the thought of resisting took too much energy. She sighed, chin resting on Wanda’s shoulder, arms loose at her sides. It was so much warmer, safer than the numbness and Agatha took in a shuddering breath. She pulled away while she still could, pressing her hand to her forehead and shaking it slightly.</p><p>“Don’t get used to it.”</p><p>Wanda laughed softly, her eyes bright with unshed tears.</p><p>“I would never. I can count on one hand the amount of times you’ve let me do that.”</p><p>Agatha sniffed, rolling her shoulders.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Wanda’s head tilted and she opened her mouth to say something, stopped, then:</p><p>“Forgive me if I’m overstepping… but I want you to come with us. To the tree lighting.”</p><p>Agatha tried to summon any kind of response and ended with a shrug.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p><p>Wanda sighed.</p><p>“Think about it, okay? I know Billy would be over the moon to have you there.”</p><p>____________</p><p>She did think about it. She considered the offer for the rest of the flight, adamantly ignoring the others after her return. The jet had been a spatter of singular conversations, curious eyes looking at her like they wanted to understand, to know.</p><p>She thought about it on their drive home, Wanda letting an easy silence fill the car as music drifted over the speakers.</p><p>She thought about it when they got to Wanda’s home and her family fell into her arms, excited and so filled with joy that it made Agatha ache.</p><p>She thought about it when Billy stepped away from the pile of bodies and ran up to her, his eyes sparkling and smile brilliant. He’d thrown his arms around her legs and stared at her in awe, waxing on about Señor Scratchy and their misadventures.</p><p>She thought about it when she was falling asleep, Nicky’s quilt held to her face, her tears wet on her cheeks.</p><p>She wasn’t going to go. She couldn’t.</p><p>Still, she thought about it some more as Thursday began and she spent the entirety of it with Señor Scratchy as he flung himself about the guesthouse.</p><p>She was still thinking when there was a tiny knock on her door.</p><p>Agatha expected a hesitant Wanda and found, instead, a bundled up little boy with red cheeks and a too-large Santa hat drooping over his face.</p><p>“Agatha, are you coming?”</p><p>The high, hopeful tone of his question made the only possible answer yes.</p><p>She stuffed her feet into her boots by the door, her straight-leg jeans folded at the ends, and pulled on a black, puffy coat over her turtleneck. She looked down at the boy, his eyes wide with excitement.</p><p>“Lead the way, then.”</p><p>But he didn’t. Instead, he reached out like it was easy, like it was right, and took her hand.</p><p>“Come on! They’re all getting in the car. Tommy said they’ll leave without us.”</p><p>Agatha let Billy drag her along and tried not to think about how small his hand felt in hers. She found Wanda and Vision already standing by the car, buckling Tommy into his seat.</p><p>Billy let go and squealed as he ran forward.</p><p>“Agatha is here!”</p><p>Wanda turned, a knowing, smug look in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha’s narrowed.</p><p>“That was low.”</p><p>Wanda shrugged, feigning thought.</p><p>“What did you always say to me? Don’t ask for permission, and don’t ask for forgiveness unless it turns out you’re wrong?”</p><p>Agatha glowered at her and Wanda tugged open the passenger door, motioning for her to climb in.</p><p>“I won’t even make you sit in the back with the boys.”</p><p>Agatha stomped to the car and climbed inside as Vision, long-limbed as he was, arranged himself in the middle seat, his head grazing the roof of the vehicle.</p><p>He smiled warmly at Agatha as Billy was buckled in beside him by Wanda.</p><p>“I’m so glad you’re coming along! Wanda said your trip was just as rife with danger as your past exploits.”</p><p>Tommy leaned forward to look at her.</p><p>“Yeah, mom said you jumped through a window.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, her head falling back as Wanda pulled herself into the driver’s seat.</p><p>Wanda shot her a look.</p><p>“You are obligated under car rules to tell the story.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“That is not real.”</p><p>Tommy’s voice called out in reprimand.</p><p>“Uh huh, it is. Dad came up with it. Everybody tells a story about their day when we are in the car.”</p><p>Wanda nodded seriously.</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms.</p><p>“The laws of sovereignty don’t matter to me, what makes you think I’ll bow to your fabricated conventions?”</p><p>Billy laughed, high and bright.</p><p>“You're funny. Are you going to tell us?”</p><p>Agatha turned in her seat and narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>“You don’t know what any of the words I said mean.”</p><p>He shrugged, his hands tucked into the straps of his car seat like he was a fifteen-year-old kid and not a child.</p><p>“I can go first. Dad says we have to make people feel good sometimes. It can make them talk more.”</p><p>Agatha turned back around and settled in, her lips curled in a frown.</p><p>“Incredible. Your children are just as horrible as the two of you.”</p><p>Wanda laughed and Agatha listened to Billy ramble for ten minutes about how they were allowed to drop their gross pumpkins from the roof at their school. Tommy added in his favorite parts, how the guts had oozed out and exploded everywhere. It was disgusting.</p><p>Billy finished rather abruptly and kicked at her seat. Violently annoying. A glimmer of satisfaction went through her as she thought about her foot jamming in Rio’s seat.</p><p>“Agatha, it’s your turn.”</p><p>She tried to figure out how to frame the story in an appropriate way for children’s ears. Saying that she launched herself suicidally through a window on the smallest notion that there was a catwalk on the other side, threw flashbangs at other living humans, fell, impaled herself on a piece of wood, and got felt up by her ex-wife seemed like it might be an error in judgment.</p><p>“Your mom and I were trying to stop a bad person from getting away and one of our teammates was in danger. I ran on top of a bunch of boxes and had to jump and break through a window to get to them in time.”</p><p>“Did it hurt?”</p><p>Agatha snorted at Tommy’s question.</p><p>“Obviously. Don’t jump through glass, kids.”</p><p>The boys giggled and Agatha grimaced.</p><p>Billy spoke next.</p><p>“You sound like a superhero.” Agatha’s chest ached. “I want to be FBI when I’m big.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, didn’t know how to.</p><p>Vision made a dramatic, pained noise.</p><p>“Not an accountant? You wound me, son.”</p><p>The scene that played out behind Agatha was long and irritating, the boys squealing as Vision tried to convince them that numbers were actually very cool.</p><p>______</p><p>To Agatha’s relief, the next two hours consisted of walking through a Christmas market, Tommy and Billy both mesmerized by the decorations and lights and small trinkets that flooded the square. They tried ciders, candies, and holiday foods from other states until Wanda cut them off. That led to an entire, gratingly loud ordeal where a sobbing Tommy had to be walked away by Vision and Billy cried into Wanda’s shirt.</p><p>Agatha watched him, his blue eyes red and his mouth turned down into a frown. The words came out of her mouth before she’d considered what she was saying.</p><p>“Is it crazy that I even miss the tantrums?”</p><p>Wanda looked at her then, trying to mask her shock. She smiled softly at Agatha, her hand rubbing against Billy’s back.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s crazy at all.”</p><p>_________</p><p>By the time the event truly began, the boys were fading fast. A slight timing error on Wanda and Visions’ parts. Tommy hadn’t let his feet touch the ground in the past thirty minutes and Billy was lagging at Wanda’s side, his hand clasped into her jacket.</p><p>They crowded around the massive tree, the space flooded with energy and hope, families and partners, dozens of screaming children that chased one another through the loosely-packed bodies. Agatha had expected it to hurt. It did. But the tears that came to her eyes as she stared on were as sweet as they were bitter.</p><p>
<i>Agatha stayed a step behind as Rio very carefully helped Nicky out of his stroller, his small body made frail by so many treatments that didn’t do what they were supposed to. His small, round face looked up toward the massive Sitka Spruce as the countdown began. Rio gently picked him up and lifted him onto her shoulders as the people around them grew louder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The countdown reached zero and Agatha stared only at her son; the way Rio lifted his hands in the air, the small wiggle of his body as he giggled in excitement at the blaze of lights in front of them. The way he swayed as the jazz musicians began to play.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Then she looked at Rio. The tears on her gaunt cheeks, the way she looked at Nicky like he might vanish if she stopped for even a moment.</i>
</p><p>Agatha frowned. She remembered being angry at Rio then. A sharp lance of it cutting through her, at the constant reminders of Nicky’s impending fate. But she remembered that Rio had smiled at their son through her own devastation and pointed out moving decorations as they spun around the base of the tree. She looked at her boots as the countdown began, her mind alight with the stirrings of a tragic, painful regret, and instead saw the face of Billy looking up at her.</p><p>His arms outstretched upward, his face sleepy and red, and Agatha could do nothing but oblige. She ignored the painful tugging in her back and arms as she lifted Billy and propped him on her hip. He tucked his head into her neck and Agatha closed her eyes as the countdown reached zero. Cheers sounded around her as the forgotten but familiar weight settled her.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, she had to blink to adjust to the brilliance.</p><p>Billy stayed in her arms for the remaining twelve minutes Tommy was able to stay calm. As they walked to the car, Billy clung to her neck and rested his head on her shoulder.</p><p>Just before they left the square, Agatha felt her attention drawn to a figure several yards away. They were back several steps from the main crowd, positioned so that no part of the tree was blocked by the stage. It took Agatha a moment to recognize her and a moment longer to understand.</p><p>Rio was alone. She hadn’t noticed Agatha or Wanda, Vision or the kids. She didn’t seem to be noticing much of anything as she stared.</p><p>They passed out of view and Agatha realized her heart was hammering. Wanda stepped close, spoke softly.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I should have warned you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, kept quiet by Billy’s now boneless weight against her.</p><p>“Does– is she usually with you?”</p><p>Wanda gave her a sad smile, one that spoke of knowing that Agatha didn’t have.</p><p>“No. We’ve asked but– she likes to go alone. She only stays for a few minutes.”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a pained breath and didn’t respond.</p>

<p>Over the next two weeks, Billy became a frequent visitor. Followed closely by Wanda.</p><p>Billy would come over after dinner most nights and knock on her door, his eyes wide and hopeful that she’d let him in to play with Señor Scratchy. He’d track in pieces of his four-year-old life: LEGOS, scattered pieces of wooden play food that likely went with a much larger set, books that he said were his favorite and that Agatha just HAD to look at. Sometimes he would open the colorful pages on her coffee table and show her. <i>”This one reminds me of Señor Scratchy. Look at his nose.”</i></p><p>Wanda would arrive after a deliberate amount of time and tell Billy it was time to get ready for sleep. He often left without a fight, running back to their house and leaving Wanda behind to close out the night; sometimes with a glass of wine, other times with a clean-up of the mess Billy left in the guest house living room.</p><p>Sometimes, when Wanda would arrive in the middle of something Billy was showing Agatha, he would grow weepy, his tired little frown curling down as he asked for a few more minutes.</p><p>Wanda would look to Agatha then, a question in her expression, and usually Agatha  would nod and they’d both watch Billy complete his drawing or LEGO creation or book.</p><p>Other times Agatha would look down, look away, and Wanda would gently cart a very upset Billy back to their house. It was a paradox of gentleness and pain. Billy was so good and he was so sweet, but then broken crayons squished into the floor and marked into the table would look just a way…</p><p>
<i>”Oh god, Rio, what happens when he finds markers?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stared at the absolute wreckage of their bathroom, the white porcelain tub scribbled to hell with every color of the rainbow, the walls specifically splashed with lines of green and purple. She sucked in her cheeks, eyes narrowing, shoulders shaking.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shoved at her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s not funny! Rio!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stumbled, her laughter pouring out of her as Agatha tried to pretend she wasn’t going to break. Rio pointed to the wall across from the toilet, her laughter fading to giggles.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think it looks nice! Look, it’s our colors. We can probably leave it as decoration if we want.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stared at the bright joy in the soft brown of Rio’s eyes, her own lips pulling up like a mirror.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re the worst.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sat down on the closed, surprisingly unscathed toilet, her eyes taking in the travesty like it was simply the greatest art of their time.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think our kid is going to grow up destroying this house.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed, her back leaning against the bathroom door.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t sound so happy about it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes lifted to Agatha’s, heavy and hopeful.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I am. He’ll be able to learn from his mistakes without fear. That’s a really–” Rio sighed. “It’s not true for every kid out there, you know?”</i>
</p><p>Those were bad nights. Nights where Agatha would hold his quilt against her chest knowing that her mind would betray her in sleep.</p><p>Work was okay. William had stuck an absurd amount of plants in their office, going so far to begin hanging them by their windows like he was even allowed to drill holes in the ceiling. She’d given up making comments and ignored the breath of life the plants expelled in their office space.</p><p>She didn’t join the team in the kitchens for their gossip, but sometimes, in strange moments, they came to her.</p><p>They would be fiercely opposed on useless topics and they’d descend on her peace like a flock of birds, squabbling and dragging her into their argument.</p><p>
<i>”Agatha, can you tell the difference between the dark and medium roast in the kitchen?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>William was holding two paper cups in his hands and Lilia, Alice, and even Jen were standing at his back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shot him an irritated look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why are you bringing a zoo to my office?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen rolled her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I told you she wouldn’t have an opinion.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha feigned sudden interest, her voice lilting.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh no, I’m incredibly invested in your discussion and do not find it at all benign. Who is saying what?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The intern set the cups on her table, lips lifted in a grin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Lilia and Jen say it’s different. Alice and I say it’s not.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha turned back to her work with a nod.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, it’s definitely not.” She started reading their new case brief. “Thanks for the swing vote.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen scoffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You didn’t even try them.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha made a show of tasting each one; both of them disgusting and acrid. One heavier than the other.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, yeah, the exact same.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice and William high-fived.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Lilia glared at Jen.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“This is your fault.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>They turned away, Jen pressing a hand to her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“How is this my fault?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha hates you because you're her competition for biggest office bitch.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Lilia!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Their voices trailed off and William grinned at Alice.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Works in our favor.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>When he turned to leave, Agatha cleared her throat, motioning to the coffee.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Get this shit off my desk.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He flushed, darting forward to take the paper cups.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sorry, thank you!”</i>
</p><p>The next time, Agatha had been walking into the kitchen to get the leftover takeout from the night previous.</p><p>
<i>She tugged open the fridge just as William appeared at her side. She flinched in surprise, eyes narrowing to a glare.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why are you looming?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>William crossed his arms.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you had to choose—“</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha held up a hand in his face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No. Do not involve me in your squabbles.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>William pouted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“But it’s important. More than the coffee, I promise.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha closed the fridge door, to-go box in hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You have until I leave this room.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>William dove in, speaking quickly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Context, the power grid has failed. What state fares the best?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha sighed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“This isn’t an either or.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Lilia slapped her hand to the table.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Exactly! But there is a right answer.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice rolled her eyes and pitched her the narrowed choices.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Wyoming or Vermont?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha reached the edge of the kitchen.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Alaska.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She continued toward her office to an influx of conversation.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Wyoming is most similar to Alaska, so—“</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You don’t get to claim her answer! Go ask Sharon.”</i>
</p><p>________</p><p>Agatha met with Alder and felt significantly more guilty than she’d expected to.</p><p>
<i>”I didn’t– Well, I planned to open the sheet and then I did not.”</i>
</p><p>Alder hadn’t been upset, which was annoying, and she’d walked Agatha through the sheet during their appointment, telling her to try to find awareness for herself rather than writing it down.</p><p>
<i>”I can do it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alder chuckled, nodding.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I know, Agatha. But sometimes an extra step can keep us from the whole of things. You can write if you want to but don’t put that pressure on yourself.”</i>
</p><p>The conversation about Rio had been far more difficult than the ones before.</p><p>
<i>”I didn’t mean to.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alder hummed, shaking her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No, let’s not separate your will from your actions. The connection you have with Rio is powerful, Agatha. For both of you. I know I don’t have to tell you that such behavior can really hamper the progress you’re trying to make. Do you think you can take space from her?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Of course.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The words felt stale as they passed her lips.</i>
</p><p>But she’d done it. Not of her own actions, per say, but she hadn’t spoken to Rio since their return, hadn’t seen her except for at a distance or passing in the hallways of the WFO. Rio hadn’t sought her out. She hadn’t taunted or teased. But she had looked. Every time. The press of it on Agatha’s skin felt so hauntingly reminiscent of their early days.</p><p>In all, Agatha felt… fragile.</p><p>It was not pleasant.</p><p>She expected that the feeling would fade as she took the actions she was supposed to, but it simply grew. It felt like she was hot steel being quenched, the rapid cooling making her brittle with no round of tempering in sight.</p><p>She expected, if she were struck against anything with mass, that she would shatter to dozens of sharp, jagged pieces.</p><p>It was poor timing, alarming, considering the quick passing of the days. She grew impatient as the week of Christmas neared, her heart permanently lodged in her throat as she went about her days.</p><p>December’s end and the months following had become a yearly agony that Agatha only survived through in a haze. But now? Her protection was stripped away.</p><p>She was walking into her annual nightmare with her bare feet on glass.</p><p>Agatha had spent so much time on her porch, her legs swinging slowly, rhythmically as the cold seeped deep into her bones. It always felt like a reprieve.</p><p>It had snowed the night prior and the sparkling white glistened on every surface of the property. Tree branches hung low with the weight of it and the grass was blanketed, untouched by footprints. She hadn’t left the guest house, had spent a lazy Sunday without interruption tucked into the corner of the couch as she tried to read one of many books left by Vision and Wanda on the small bookshelf in her room. It took her thirty minutes to accept that she was still not patient enough to be a reader.</p><p>She dropped the third attempted book to the side and sat up, her eyes roaming the space.</p><p>One of Billy’s coloring books, Superheroes, was left on the corner of her coffee table and she pulled it in front of her. Wanda had brought her a plastic pencil box after a trio of nights that Billy had left crayons and markers strewn across the carpet.</p><p>She tugged the blue lid open and stared at the somewhat grubby, damaged coloring utensils.</p><p>Her fingers slid along the tan pages and opened it at random. She huffed out a laugh at the image. ‘Green Lantern’ was written at the top and the black lines showed him in a power pose. Billy had colored him in almost entirely blue. She flipped to the next, ‘The Hulk.’ Also blue. He definitely had a favorite color.</p><p>The next page was empty and Agatha drew in a weak breath. Spider-Man had been a favorite for Nicky, though not the ultimate hero he idolized. Agatha pulled a red marker from the box and slid onto the carpet, her head bending over the image.</p><p>She remained focused for the next thirty minutes, her hand beginning to ache as she drew a shitty sun in the corner to finish her work.</p><p>
<i>Rio stuck the coloring page to their fridge with a magnet shaped like the letter S, her lips pursed in thought, her brow furrowed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha looked over from where she stood by the stove, idly stirring. She chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tilted her head, her hands on her hips, her blazer flaring out under them. She still had her badge on her belt. Her gun had been placed in their closet safe immediately upon entering the home.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha looked at the slope of her ass in her slacks. She loved Rio in her many suits. This one was gray, the cut sleek, tailored sharply to her body.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio turned, head leaning down into Agatha’s vision.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hello, sweetheart.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha blinked, her lips curling, eyes dark.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hmm?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio smirked.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I answered your question.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hummed, feigning understanding.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I know.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stepped into her, hands resting against her bare hips, fingers scratching lightly. Agatha had been home first and she’d tossed on the cleanest clothes she could find in their overly large piles of semi-dirty laundry. She’d donned a pair of Rio’s black joggers and one of Rio’s cropped t-shirts.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s palm slid under the shirt, warm against Agatha’s stomach.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What did I say?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha reached over and set the spoon on the it’s rest, her arms wrapping around Rio’s neck.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That you’re grateful I’m making dinner?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s smile widened, her hand sliding to support Agatha’s back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Couldn’t be that.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pouted and Rio leaned in to kiss her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She teased her tongue on Agatha’s top lip and pulled back. She slid behind Agatha to wrap her arms around her waist, her chin on Agatha’s shoulder. She nodded toward the picture on the fridge.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think Nicky got it a little backwards.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha looked at the picture of Spider-Man, his suit blue where it should be red, and red where it should be blue. She held Rio’s arms against her and chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“He looks like one of those popsicles.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio murmured her agreement, her body slumping tiredly into Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What are you making?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha slowly shifted, holding Rio’s weight as she turned in her arms. She gripped her tired face, thumbs brushing along her cheekbones.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“The easiest thing I could think of. Pesto pasta.” She gently pressed Rio back. “Why don’t you go lay down, love. I’ll bring it to you when it’s done.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her finished coloring page for several moments before she ripped it from the book and turned it face-down on the coffee table.</p><p>With a back stiff from sitting still for so long, Agatha gathered her largest blanket and stuffed her socked feet into her slippers. She poured herself a glass of wine and walked outside to watch the moon rise over the back garden. She’d felt the bite of the cold until it had become a dull touch, the blanket wrapped around her shoulders tightly. She’d been there for a while– dinnertime had come and gone– half listening for the patter of little feet in the snow.</p><p>Instead, she heard Wanda’s voice speaking quietly, Billy letting out a small whine following whatever she’d said. They appeared around the corner, their bodies bundled in boots and thick coats. Billy was holding a mug as he walked, a significant amount of the liquid inside splashing over the edges into the snow.</p><p>He grinned as soon as he saw her, his legs carrying him quickly toward the stairs. Another splash of what looked like hot cider slushed over the edge, soaking his blue mitten. He held it out to her like he was presenting her with an award.</p><p>“I made you cider.”</p><p>Agatha took the half-empty glass before it could soak his other hand.</p><p>“Thank you Billy, that’s very kind.”</p><p>Wanda walked up behind him.</p><p>“He insisted that he bring it over himself.” She looked apologetic, her eyes flickering toward the dozens of spots of melted snow. She leaned down by Billy. “What did mom say about tonight’s visit?”</p><p>Billy’s lips turned down but he didn’t cry. He looked at his hands, voice quiet.</p><p>“It’s mom and Agatha time.”</p><p>Wanda smiled.</p><p>“Exactly. Tommy said he wanted to play cars with you.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes lit up even as he sighed at his mom.</p><p>“They’re monster trucks.”</p><p>Wanda nodded.</p><p>“Of course, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Billy turned with a wave, then stopped.</p><p>“Mom, are you giving her the book? She has to read it before Christmas Day.”</p><p>Agatha noted a mild tensing in Wanda’s shoulders even as the woman smiled.</p><p>“Of course. I’ll give it to her. I promised.”</p><p>Billy nodded like he’d concluded his very important business and he looked at Agatha with excitement.</p><p>“You’ll love Auntie Rio. She does funny voices for Santa and Olive.”</p><p>Agatha froze at the words, biting back her reaction, the sharp question that almost spat from her mouth.</p><p>Wanda grimaced and touched Billy’s shoulder.</p><p>“Go find Tommy, baby.”</p><p>Billy waved again and trudged down the steps, his boots squelching in the snow.</p><p>Agatha turned on Wanda for answers.</p><p>Wanda held out a hand.</p><p>“Wait, I know. That’s what I came to talk to you about, Agatha.” Wanda didn’t ask before she squeezed herself into the porch swing, stealing a part of her blanket like Agatha wouldn’t launch her off the porch. “It’s freezing out here, how are you–”</p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda sighed and waited until Agatha had resituated herself, putting distance between their shoulders.</p><p>“Rio has been coming here for most holidays since– for a long time. She comes for dinners most weekends.” Wanda glanced over at her. “She offered to stay home this year but that didn’t seem right.”</p><p>Agatha felt like she’d been dumped in a snow drift. Her hands squeezed together tightly under the blanket. She didn’t know where to start.</p><p>“She’s been here while–”</p><p>“No.” Wanda stared out over the snow now marred by their footprints. “She hasn’t been here since you moved into the guesthouse.”</p><p>It made Agatha feel odd, a strange guilt blooming in her chest. She tried to grind it out and only partially succeeded. A mild strain of panic sounded like an alarm in her head.</p><p>“It’s– it doesn’t matter. I wasn’t planning on joining in for the Maximoff mush-fest anyway.”</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>Agatha quickly stood.</p><p>“I’m going to bed, Wanda.” She paused as she reached the screen door. “Don’t send Billy to get me. On Christmas. I can’t– I don’t want to be there.”</p><p>Wanda stood after her.</p><p>“Wait. You should still take this. Billy wants you to have it.”</p><p>She handed over a perfectly-wrapped, thin present. There was a bow on the top and a little sticker that said ‘From: Billy’ in sharp, large handwriting.</p><p>___________</p><p>Wanda kept her word all of Christmas Morning as cars began to fill up the driveway, friends coming to help them prepare for what was turning out to be a rather large gathering. Agatha could see the main house from her upstairs window. She sat in her chair and watched as a family of five– each in the ugliest sweaters to ever exist– climbed out of a white Ford. A man and woman; their kids ranging from the twins’ ages to a bit older. Each carried bags and wrapped gifts as they moved toward the back entrance.</p><p>Billy and Tommy sprinted outside, both of them bouncing excitedly on their toes as the youngest newcomer ran to greet them. Vision and Wanda appeared in the doorway and Agatha looked away as they embraced.</p><p>The next group arrived in two vehicles. One was a sleek, black Mercedes that was probably worth double Agatha’s yearly salary. Maybe more. The other was a navy blue Audi. Four women stepped out of the two cars and Agatha’s brows raised. Wanda had very, very attractive friends. They had their own loud sweaters, these ones with lights stitched into various parts of the designs.</p><p>The driver of the Mercedes, a brunette, likely in her early thirties, with her hair pulled into a high pony, opened the trunk. Two dogs leapt out— a Golden Retriever and an Akita— barking and yelping as they raced into the garden. The passenger of the Mercedes was blonde and severe, her hair braided down her back. She leaned into the car for several moments, and soon a girl of about five was jumping into her arms.</p><p>The two women in the Audi were somewhat older, likely late thirties. One had chin-length red hair. The other had her dark brown hair pulled into flat bun at the back of her neck.</p><p>All four of the women looked like they were in law enforcement of some kind. The way they carried themselves, the alertness as they took in their surroundings idly, all pointed to years of physical and mental training.</p><p>Wanda had transferred for a year and a half just after graduating from Quantico. Agatha found out later that she’d gone to work alongside her brother; that she’d returned to DC after he’d been killed on a mission gone south.</p><p>The four women were the last to arrive for some time and Agatha finally pulled her eyes away from the window.</p><p>She felt fluctuated between a sense of being out of her own body over the next hour, her mind cloudy as she tried to think about anything but the impending arrival of her ex-wife. Any time she resettled, she felt like her nerves had been split and rolled in citric acid.</p><p>In general, unpleasant. There was something impending and it sat against her shoulder, waiting, watching.</p><p>Agatha cleaned the kitchen until it was spotless before moving into the living room. She gathered all of Billy’s toys and stuck them together in a basket, vacuumed the rugs, mopped the hardwood floor, wiped down the dust from the television.</p><p>She even swept the snow off of her porch to keep herself occupied.</p><p>Within an hour she was back in her room with her laundry; pairing her socks and refilling her closet.</p><p>She’d just finished hanging the last of her clothing, every chore she could think of already completed, when she heard the arrival of another guest. She told herself to stay away from the window, a part of her <i>knowing</i> exactly who’d she’d see if she looked.</p><p>Her feet carried her there anyway.</p><p>The standard Bucar sat behind the Audi, its lights flicking off as Rio stepped out. She looked– it wasn’t the normal suit, the dark sweaters, even the button-downs she often wore at work. She’d apparently been given the same cue as the others; a god-awful, horrendous, puke-worthy sweater. Rio’s was nearly fluorescent green with red-striped sleeves and a large, brown image on the front that Agatha couldn’t make out. She was so busy trying to decipher it that she didn’t notice immediately that the passenger door had opened.</p><p>When she finally looked, Agatha’s heart nearly stopped.</p><p>There, standing in Wanda’s driveway, was a man with deep brown skin, his hair was twisted into tight curls that bounced as he walked. He was so much taller than Agatha imagined him.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted into itself, her lips parting in shock as she stared at Rio’s past becoming present.</p><p>
<i>Agatha found herself looking at the picture in Rio’s room more frequently, her eyes lingering on the details she’d picked out again and again. The more she stared, the more her curiosity overwrote the fear of the answer she might receive. She sat on the edge of the bed, studying it, until Rio’s bathroom door opened in the hallway.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha averted her gaze to the newly framed picture above Rio’s small desk. She smiled.<br/>
Agatha had walked into Rio’s room a week prior and found it nailed into the wall. It was from a recent Trivia night, the red-head– Wanda, she finally remembered– had snapped a photo of Rio and Agatha amongst the many others taken and later shared in the group chat. They were standing in front of a dart board, Rio grinning, Agatha scowling, the score visible in the corner revealing that Rio had won by six points. The photo was framed like a prized possession, the permanent reminder of Agatha’s place in her life.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d never felt insecure that Rio hadn’t done so before that. Not really. Over the past two months, she’d made herself a frequent enough guest that it didn’t really matter if Rio always picked up her items, often strewn across the apartment, and placed them neatly together for Agatha to collect.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Sure, the first time it had happened she’d been a little sour. Agatha had stayed over for the second time in the new place and she’d brought in her gym and work bag. They’d gone to work in the morning, carpooled, and returned with set plans to go to the gym around the corner.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had changed quickly when they’d gotten to Rio’s apartment. Her pants hand ended up on the arm of the couch, her oxfords were stuffed under the coffee table, and the sweater she’d been wearing was slung over a chair in the kitchen.</i>
</p><p>
<i>After the gym, Agatha had stripped down and taken the first shower while Rio ordered them shitty take-out from around the block.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d walked out, wrapped in a towel, to find every single one of her personal belongings carefully folded or stacked just to the right of the bathroom door. She’d frowned, confused, and quickly let her mind draw the wrong conclusions.</i>
</p><p>
<i>So she’d stayed the night last night. Was Rio suggesting she not do so again? Why not just ask her to leave? The passive aggressiveness of the action had Agatha tearing out of the room in her towel.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you want me to go, you can tell me, Rio. I’m not going to fight you about it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was sitting on the couch in her shorts and a cut-off shirt. She had fluffy socks on her feet and her hair was pulled up in a pony, the strands of it around her face messy with dried sweat. Her eyes had widened in confusion and alarm.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t want you to leave.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d said it so simply, almost like Agatha was stupid, and Agatha had felt like she might be. She’d lost her steam, her shoulders lowering from their defensive position as she stood almost naked in Rio’s living room.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had opened her mouth, expression fluctuating between worry and bemusement. She’d hesitated and then tilted her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why did you think that?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had looked back toward the bedroom, motioning to it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You–” She’d felt foolish, embarrassed. “You put all my stuff by the door.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had flushed then, her eyes dropping away from Agatha as she’d reached for the take-out menu like she hadn’t already sent in the order.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had seen the tell-tale sign of Rio shutting down and quickly bit the bullet. She’d sat down beside Rio, skin drying under the slow-moving fan above.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m sorry for assuming.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had shrugged, her brow furrowed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No, it makes sense why you thought that.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had gently pried the menu from her hands and set it on the table. She’d settled her hand on Rio’s inner wrist and rubbed a soothing pattern against her soft skin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you want to tell me?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had been silent for so long that Agatha figured the conversation was dropped. She’d been about to apologize again when Rio’s fingers twisted together. Her voice had been so quiet when she spoke, almost as if she was in a trance.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Grim always said the best way to lose what belonged to you was by assuming it was safe.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>So much of the sentence had given Agatha pause; the word choice, odd, the name drop. She’d wished she’d at least pulled on a t-shirt before starting such a seemingly important conversation.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d wanted to ask who Grim was, why anyone worried so much about their belongings– or why they wouldn’t be safe.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But Rio had cleared her throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m going to shower.” She’d stood, paused. “If– I want you to stay. If you still want to.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had stayed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had gotten out of the shower and they’d pretended like a hidden door hadn’t been pried open for a future exploration.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They never talked about it, and Rio continued to collect Agatha’s items for her, placing them by the bathroom door. The first several times, she’d made sure to tell Agatha she wanted her to stay.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha realized Rio was doing it– had been doing it— for her own items at Agatha’s place. It had seemed normal there, like a show of respect to keep things clean. But it held such a new meaning after their conversation.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes slipped to Rio as she walked into her bedroom, her hair stringy and wet around her head. She’d gotten in the shower almost immediately after Agatha had arrived, offering a quick kiss to her cheek before she’d disappeared. It wasn’t strange in itself, but Rio hadn’t looked at her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She still didn’t as she walked into her closet and quickly pulled on boxers and a long-sleeved tee, her back to Agatha. She finished getting ready and climbed into the bed next to her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha frowned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes fell to her like she was surprised she was there. She smiled but it didn’t reach her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yeah?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her voice was flat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha gripped Rio’s arm, turned her gently. She knew something was wrong but wasn’t sure how to get to the root of it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Is something– What’s wrong?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked like she was about to lie. She paused, frowned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I thought I could hang out tonight but–” Rio shrugged. “I’m not going to be very enjoyable to be around.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha frowned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t need to be entertained.” She pushed wet strands from Rio’s face. She felt so far away from her. “If you want to talk, I’m here. If you want to watch one of those stupid, awful, scary movies, we can. If you want me to go–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s head lifted quickly. She looked alarmed and Agatha’s heart squeezed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded, her hands collecting Rio’s and holding them on her thighs.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay. Do you want me to keep listing options or do you have something in mind?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio huffed. She seemed to chew on the words that were to follow, her brow furrowing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I had a brother.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The words hit like a glacier. The ‘had’ of it all. The way she said it like she would say she’d gone to the store or that she’d worked late. Agatha didn’t interrupt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio took her time gathering her thoughts.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“His name was Ekon, but he liked to go by Grim. He thought it made him sound scarier.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Suddenly the apron in Rio’s kitchen made sense; the little Grim Reaper patch sewn into the fabric with the wrong color thread.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio let out a light laugh, eyes falling to the wrinkled photograph.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We were in a foster home for four years in this…” She shrugged. “It was a bad place. When the state finally found out, they picked us up and didn’t care to ask if we wanted to stay together. I got sent to some shithole in Virginia and he–” Rio shrugged. “I don’t know. He disappeared. Fifteen years ago today.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat. Rio’s expression was blank like the things she was saying weren’t a dull blade between the ribs. She she was startled by Rio’s dissociation from it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Did you look for him?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio didn’t immediately shut her down but she showed her first hint of feeling, her lips turned up in a sad smile.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why do you think I joined the FBI?” Rio’s eyes finally met Agatha’s and the devotion there, the intensity of it, knocked Agatha’s air from her lungs. “I know it’s crazy; dedicating a good portion of my life to a job I only pursued for the resources. But I figured, if I didn’t like it but I found him, I could just wash out. Who would miss me, you know?” She shrugged, chuckled. “I never did. I tracked him to Kenner, Louisiana and then he just… vanished.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mind was racing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Are you still searching?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sometimes. But I’ve approached it from every angle and there’s nothing.” Rio chewed her lip. “I enjoy the job now. I’m good at it. And I met you.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s heart stuttered, a new pattern hammering in her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked at their clasped hands and let out a strained breath, like what she was about to say was somehow more significant than the bomb she’d just dropped. “I think I didn’t really know that life could be like this.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha watched, her breathing shallow, as the back door opened to the pair. Wanda came out with the most sincere smile on her face. She hugged Rio tightly and drew back before her hands reached out to clasp one of Grim’s. It looked like an introduction and Agatha couldn’t believe that this moment, Rio had waited over two decades for, was happening without her.</p><p>The trio spoke for some time, Rio’s smile so real and honest that it made Agatha’s teeth ache.</p><p>A loud squeal sounded from the house and the four youngest kids darted from the back door, the two dogs behind them barking. The chaos that ensued was a reprieve. Agatha almost smiled when the large Akita nearly took out Rio’s legs.</p><p>And then Billy was diverting from the group and he was running up to Rio with a huge smile. He gripped her hand and he pointed toward the guesthouse like he wanted to show Rio something incredible.</p><p>Rio’s head turned, her expression tense as she took in the house Agatha had been staying for weeks.</p><p>Wanda quickly intervened, but the boulder had been pushed over the edge of the hill. Billy started to run toward her front porch, his little legs carrying him far faster than one might expect a four year old to move.</p><p>Wanda caught up to him just as he passed out of sight under the roof’s edge.</p><p>Agatha heard him start to cry through the window and saw the many heads turn in his direction, the dogs circling around Wanda’s legs as she reappeared.</p><p>Vision stepped from the main house to watch in concern as a now-screaming Billy was carried toward the door, his tiny fists pressed into his eyes and his shoulders shaking.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe.</p><p>She hadn’t expected disappointing Billy to feel like this; she hadn’t expected him to remember her at all with the packed house.</p><p>Agatha looked away from the window, tried to focus.</p><p>She’d meant to let them have their holiday without causing a spectacle. She was trying to be good. So what if it was selfish too. She knew herself, she knew that she was no good at propriety when Rio Vidal was in a half-mile radius and the Maximoff’s didn’t deserve to have their Christmas ruined.</p><p>She pressed her hand to her chest.</p><p>Agatha’s ears rang like they had when she’d tossed the flashbangs across the enclosed dock. She sucked in lungfuls of air that didn’t provide any relief.</p><p>She touched her hand to her forehead and tried to gather her racing thoughts, her body feeling heavy and light, hot and cold at once.</p><p>Things that felt like truths curled through her ears, thick and thorny. Her attempts to change were not enough. She didn’t mean it. If she meant it she would be better by now. She would continue to be swallowed by her losses, alone and isolated, until a reckless mistake or a break of bad luck found her on the wrong end of a bullet.</p><p>Agatha laid back on her bed, hoping that opening herself up would remove the terrifying haze, the claustrophobic sense of dread that fell over her. It did not.</p><p>She suffered through it for minutes until she was certain she would never recover, until she thought she might die right there on Nicky’s blanket.</p><p>With maximum effort, Agatha scrambled for her phone, her jaw clenched, and found the number she was looking for. It rang for so long Agatha expected the call to go to voicemail, then:</p><p>“Agatha, are you alright?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath, just the presence of another voice in her room slowing her thoughts. She pressed her hand to her forehead, her words coming out strained. Trying to explain what she was feeling seemed impossible.</p><p>“Yes. No. No, I’m not.”</p><p>Alder didn’t seem to need an explanation. Her voice remained steady, soothing.</p><p>“That’s okay, Agatha. I want you to listen and answer my questions the best you can. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“What do you see right now?”</p><p>“The ceiling. The fan is spinning.”</p><p>“Are you cold?”</p><p>She frowned, her mind slipping to the present as she tried to figure out what her body was feeling.</p><p>“I don’t think so.”</p><p>“Okay. What are you touching?”</p><p>“Nicky’s quilt.”</p><p>“What part of the quilt?”</p><p>Agatha focused on the tips of her fingers.</p><p>“The stitching.”</p><p>“That’s good, Agatha. What do you hear in your immediate vicinity?”</p><p>Agatha listened.</p><p>“I can hear the plumbing in the walls.” Her breathing slowed. “The motor in the fan.”</p><p>“Good. I want you to breathe in as deeply as you can, until your lungs are full. I want you to hold it for three seconds. Release. Keep doing it until I stop you.”</p><p>Agatha did. She let her chest expand, felt the pleasant ache in her lungs, and breathed it out. She lost track of the count after seven, her eyes closing.</p><p>Finally, Alder stopped her.</p><p>“Alright, Agatha. Can you tell me how you’re feeling?”</p><p>The return of clarity also brought a rush of embarrassment, of shame.</p><p>“It’s Christmas, I shouldn’t–”</p><p>“I’m very happy you did. My wife knows that I wouldn’t answer unless it was important.”</p><p>Wife. That made sense.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Do you have a history of panic attacks? We didn’t cover that in your background.”</p><p>Agatha tried to recall a single time she’d felt like that.</p><p>“I don’t think so.” Agatha grimaced, pressed her hands further into the quilt. “Why would that start now? I thought–” She cleared her throat. “I’m trying.”</p><p>“Exactly. For years, you didn’t allow yourself to grieve, to feel. Facing that now is going to have consequences.”</p><p>Agatha’s laugh was caustic.</p><p>“That fucking sucks.”</p><p>Alder chuckled.</p><p>“It will get better. Do you want to tell me what happened?”</p><p>Agatha did, her words short, stilted. She didn’t mention Grim, didn’t have the words to explain the conflict in her heart and head.</p><p>At the end, Alder responded just as steadily as before.</p><p>“Do you think it would be good for you to be over there?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then you’ve done nothing wrong, Agatha. You are taking care of yourself. That is your most important goal. The connection you’ve built with Billy and Wanda will continue beyond this one small interruption. I would suggest leaving your room, finding something to do for the night that makes you happy.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“I don’t have hobbies.”</p><p>Alder chuckled.</p><p>“Start one.”</p><p>The call had ended a bit later and Agatha dropped her phone onto her bed.</p><p>She listened to the advice because the alternative would eat her from the inside out.</p><p>Agatha made her way down the staircase and pulled open the closet, her eyes roving over the many game boxes stacked on the shelves. She saw a 1000 piece puzzle and rolled her eyes before dragging it out.</p><p>For the next three hours, Agatha relaxed into thoughts of edge pieces and shades of green and blue and red as she began to patch together an image of a forest lake with a boat sitting in the center of it. Night came, and Agatha only took a break when her eyes were starting to glaze, her neck and back stiff.</p><p>She stared at the boundary and the three sections she’d completed with a mild sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Her stomach growled as she pushed herself to her feet. She searched through her kitchen, about to settle for buttered toast, when there was a knock on the door.</p><p>Agatha tensed, a slew of possibilities running through her mind as she moved to stare at the wooden frame.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Vision.</p><p>She opened the door with a frown.</p><p>He smiled at her and lifted two plates in her direction, a bag slung over his shoulder.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I was sent here due to my general lack of persuasion skills. We just wanted to make sure you had dinner.” Once she’d taken the plates he freed the bag. “These are from all of us.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what to say. She stared at the overloaded plates that could likely feed three full adults and then glanced at the bag in his hand.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Vision smiled and leaned forward to set the bag inside the door. He stuck his hands in his coat pockets and grinned too chummily.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Your sweater is hideous.”</p><p>He looked down at the dark red material and grinned.</p><p>“Thank you!” He pointed to the Santa wearing a bathing suit and standing on a sandy beach. “I don’t suppose I’ll win this year, but I thought it was a staunch effort.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“How disappointing.”</p><p>Vision, as always, responded as if her sarcasm was sincere.</p><p>“It is so.”</p><p>They stood there in silence for several moments before Agatha stepped back.</p><p>“Well. Goodnight.”</p><p>Vision smiled.</p><p>“Ah, yes, rest well Agatha. Merry Christmas.”</p><p>The food was incredible with all the expected staples and some surprises she wasn’t sure what to make of. There was some kind of grain pudding that seemed very Eastern European; wheat, raisins, honey, poppy seeds, and hazelnuts all mixed together. A large portion of deep fried turkey leg with Cajun seasoning filled half a plate and she picked it clean to the bone.</p><p>By the time she’d finished her helping of crispy Mac and Cheese, an odd packet of Sriracha sitting next to it untouched, Agatha thought she might puke. She put the rest in the fridge and returned to glare at the bag on the floor.</p><p>It was stuffed with a stack of green and white presents with large bows. Her jaw clenched as she looked away toward the singular, thin present still sitting on her coffee table.</p><p>Leaving the bag untouched, Agatha lifted Billy’s gift with a weary sigh. She pulled the wrapping paper from it to reveal a book with a small dog that seemed to be flying—held by a string— over a little town.</p><p>She let out a breath and opened the first page.</p><p>It was sweet, she understood why Billy liked it. A little dog certain she was meant to be a reindeer that trekked to the North Pole to help Santa.</p><p>She ignored the pressing comment he’d made about Rio, about how she made her voices. Her heart clenched and she pushed the onslaught of memories from her mind as she made her way to her room.</p><p>She didn’t look out the window and didn’t check whether more cars had arrived.</p><p>Agatha climbed under the quilt and pulled it to her nose and cried herself to sleep.</p><p>__________</p><p>The next morning brought relief, the staggering sadness from the previous day now muted.</p><p>Agatha made herself coffee and held the warm ceramic in her hands as she opened her front door.</p><p>She stilled.</p><p>Sitting on the arm of the swing was a dried bundle of yellow lilies, their stems wrapped in twine. Tucked into the twine was a small note.</p><p>Agatha took it with shaking fingers, her chest tight, and pulled at the paper. There was a small note in achingly familiar script.</p><p>
<i>Merry Christmas, Agatha. —R</i>

<p>Agatha drove in to work even though the whole team was meant to be off. They were being brought into an ongoing investigation that was likely going to monopolize their time for the foreseeable future, so Wanda had made sure to carve out a few days around Christmas before the storm.</p><p>The office was dark, empty, and it felt as if she’d walked into a school after hours, the lack of life somewhat jarring. Agatha flipped on the lights in the command center, walked through to the kitchen, and made herself a cup of coffee. She grimaced as she took a sip. Apparently William had discovered the shitty machine’s secrets and hadn’t told her about it. It was sour against her tongue and she quickly dumped it down the drain.</p><p>Agatha started toward her office and glanced into Alice and Lilias’. On their desks there were presents stacked, wrapped in various colors and with varying skill-level. She swung her gaze to Sharon and Jens’ and found the same thing. A dread settled in her chest at what she’d find in her own office. She didn’t look at her desk right away, only focused on the enormous pile on<br/>
William’s desk. A small smile lifted her lips as she looked at it, eyes glazing.</p><p>She braced herself and turned back to her own desk, feeling a surge of surprise. It looked the same as the others; a handful of presents stacked on the corner. Agatha’s throat tightened. She walked over to the stack and looked down at the one on top. It was from William and he’d tucked a little card into the ribbon.</p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh and sat down, her legs kicking out and her shoulders slumping down. She swung the chair side to side as she stared. She’d opened the Maximoff’s gifts at the end of Christmas day when her eyes could barely remain open.</p><p>Vision had gotten her a handcrafted wooden chess set with the vintage Parker Staunton chess pattern. It was boxwood, the pieces were burnt and engraved to reveal a pattern across the bases and necks. Wanda had gotten her a set of speakers with a note, ‘I know you brought the record player. I saw it tucked into a box when we helped you unload.’ Tommy had wrapped one of his favorite toys, a large, purple and black dinosaur, and Wanda had left her a note that she was meant to display it on the mantle for protection, on Tommy’s orders. Billy had given her another gift, a brand new stack of coloring books and crayons that they could use together. There’d been an entire bag of toys and cedar blocks just for Señor Scratchy.</p><p>She’d cried because that was all she seemed capable of, and decided she’d return the favor, even if it was going to be late. Now she had more presents to buy.</p><p>Agatha groaned loudly, her eyes narrowing at the gifts.</p><p>Her mind had been alight and sifting through ideas from the drive in to the moment she’d been distracted by this new dilemma.</p><p>Agatha reached for the stack, taking William’s off the top.</p><p>She opened the card.</p><p>
<i>Hi Agatha! Merry Christmas. I know you haven’t put up any decorations but I wanted to give you this in case you decided you wanted to. I know you’ll gag to read it, but I’m happy to have the opportunity to learn from you. Thanks for everything. </i>
</p><p>She stripped the paper to reveal a collage picture frame with seven black &amp; white photographs tucked behind the glass. Most of them candid, depicting their team in the three months they’d been working together. One was Lilia and Jen standing in the consulate house kitchen with matching aprons, Lilia clearly ordering Jen around. The one below showed herself and William at the ROC with matching slouched positions, their chairs facing one another as they conferred on the case.</p><p>The next was a picture of William and Alice actually looking at the camera, peace signs showing as they stood on the balcony of the consulate house. It looked like one of their days off, their clothing casual, and Agatha could barely make out two handheld electronics on the chairs behind them. There were three photos of the team clearly shot by Will, each of them taking their subjects by mild surprise.</p><p>There was one of Wanda sitting at the central table in the command center. She looked like she’d just glanced up and found a camera in her face. She still managed a soft, irritatingly genuine smile. The next was of Lilia and Alice in their offices, both peering at the camera over their desks in a mix of confusion and amusement. The third was Jen, her hand held out toward the camera while the other gripped the handle of a coffee mug. Most of her face was blocked and Agatha smirked. She would hate it and that made it Agatha’s favorite.</p><p>The last image, the largest one, was a group photo from their pseudo-Thanksgiving dinner taken with from what looked to be the spice shelf if the round plastic and red lid barely in the corner was anything to go by. They were all there with the addition of Rio. Only William seemed to be aware of it, like he’d set it to go off behind them. He was turned toward the camera slightly, a pleased grin on his face. The rest of them were in action, all eyes on Agatha as she told her knitting needle story. It made Agatha feel sick, the warm surprise on her own face.</p><p>And then she looked at Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach clenched and she drew in a slow breath.</p><p>Rio was looking at her like she was something holy. Like Agatha was the only person that existed in the room. It was the same look she’d seen thousands of times, the one that would catch her off-guard as she did the dishes in their house or spoke about things as mundane as who would be able to pick Nicky up from daycare.</p><p>Agatha quickly set down the frame face-down and snatched another package from the pile.</p><p>Jen’s gift was next and Agatha grimaced as she tore open the card.</p><p>
<i>You’re getting old. You should take care of your skin. Hag.</i>
</p><p>She revealed an expensive collection of creams, oils, and cleansers with a set of printed instructions. Agatha rolled her eyes and moved on.</p><p>She read Lilia’s card.</p><p>
<i>Sometimes we need a little extra guidance when our own minds are lost.</i>
</p><p>Agatha stripped the paper back to reveal a tarot deck. She carefully flipped the tab and slid the deck out, finding cards with stunning, classic artwork etched across the faces. It wasn’t something she knew much about, but she felt a warmth in her chest as she took in the gift. It was brief; discomfort crept in as she remembered their conversation in the ROC, the easy way Lilia had spoken of Agatha’s hidden truths. She set the deck to the side.</p><p>Sharon had left her a set of red wines, the vineyard a local one that probably tasted like kids’ grape juice if the screw-off cap was anything to go by. There was a small note that stated <i>My sister runs this lovely little Vineyard! I hope you enjoyed your holidays.</i> Agatha couldn’t tell if this was an advertising scheme or if Sharon truly believed the wine was good.</p><p>Alice’s card held just a quick note.</p><p>
<i>Sorry, I had help. Wanda said you had a record player and I figured you should be in the know of what “the kids” are listening to these days.</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s chest squeezed as she peeled back the paper over what were clearly a pair of records. The first was one she recognized from William and Alice’s conversations. She peered at the second and let out an amused huff. Hozier, Frank Ocean. She set them on her desk and puffed out her cheeks.</p><p>She hated owing people. There was no way she’d write out any sappy little notes to be passed around, but she could settle her debts.</p><p>She glanced back over toward the kitchen with a frown. Six birds, one giant boulder. Agatha began to research, her computer whirring to life as she parsed through pages of coffee makers. She settled on one, checked the delivery date, and added the item to her cart. The team wouldn’t be in until Monday unless an emergency dragged them back to the office. She could accept the risk. Agatha put in the WFO’s address and left explicit instructions for the delivery driver.</p><p>She huffed out a relieved sigh as soon as she submitted her payment. It was a lot of money, yes. But, Wanda was only letting her pay for her utilities so she was very capable of affording it.</p><p>She changed her focus to the Maximoffs.</p><p>She purchased a pair of ridiculous matching robes that she knew Wanda and Vision would love, ordered a silly game called Qwirkle and a set of Magna-Tiles for the boys, and placed a pick up order at Politics and Prose for a beloved book with a hesitant set of clicks. She stared at the cover in her cart and closed her eyes.</p><p>
<i>Agatha quickly chased after Nicky, her lips pulling into a tired smile as he squealed his way toward their home office. He’d only started walking a month prior and now he was on a dead sprint toward Rio with a book grasped in his chubby hand. He nearly tumbled into the small room and used both of his hands to lift the book as he stepped out of sight.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha followed him in to find Rio standing, a smile tugging her lips up even as she closed multiple files and shut her laptop. She leaned down to Nicky and lifted him up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hello, my sweet boy! I thought we were going to sleep.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sorry, love, I wasn’t doing the voices well enough.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky sat against Rio’s hip, his binky hanging from his shirt by a clip, his socked feet kicking excitedly into Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio narrowed her eyes at Nicky, her voice lilting higher as she tickled his stomach.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Were you being so mean to mama?” He screeched, his eyes nearly closed as his infectious laugh carried through the room. She wiggled her fingers again, grinning. “Were you being mean to mama so I had to come read to you?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha watched on as Nicky giggled nearly uncontrollably, his hands almost dropping the book before Rio caught it and held it up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“King Bidgood’s in the Bathtub?” Rio’s voice raised into the high, silly one she used for the Page. “Oh, who knows what to do?!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She swayed as Nicky clung to her and laughed, his head falling to rest on her shoulder, his cheeks red.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha watched the two sway together, Rio’s joy splashed like watercolor against her skin. It was in every line of her, in every look she gave their son. She had bloomed into something new, something so brilliant it took Agatha’s breath away every time she saw the two together. Nicky had found a part of Rio that even Agatha had never seen.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She met Rio’s eyes and hoped her own always showed her wife how much she adored her, how happy she was.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio walked toward her with a grin and slowed to lean in for a kiss, her lips soft on Agatha’s. Nicky’s hands pushed up into their faces, so that he could press his own head between theirs with a squeal.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha and Rio gave him dozens of kisses on his cheeks and on his nose and on the top of his head until he was laughing so hard it could be concerning. Rio grinned and pulled back for him to catch his breath.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay, my little king. Bedtime.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She walked him into the hallway of their house, her feet sinking into the plush carpet. Agatha trailed behind her and sat at the foot of Nicky’s bed as Rio laid him down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio settled in next to him, her eyes flicking toward Agatha to smile, before she pulled the book open. She angled the first page toward him and put on her page’s voice.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“‘Help! Help!’ cried the Page when the sun came up. ‘King Bidgood’s in the the Bathtub, and he won’t get out!’”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky’s eyes drooped, the laugh that came out quiet and sleepy, but Rio continued because those laughs were easily turned to tears.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha watched, her heart full, and felt her own eyes drooping as Rio made her way through the story, pointing every picture toward Nicky even when his eyes stopped blinking open.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s voice lowered in volume every page until she reached the end and very quietly closed the book. She set it on Nicky’s bedside table and gently stood, her eyes falling to Agatha. She slid her fingers into Agatha’s hair and cupped the back of her neck.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Look at this, another sleepy baby.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s fingers circled her wrist, her eyes closing at the soft touch. She wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Mhmm. I need my bedtime story too.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio chuckled and caught one of her hands to pull her to her feet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They walked from the room, fingers intertwined as they stepped into their bedroom. Agatha fell dramatically on the bed and let out a tired sigh.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio followed after her, crawling until she could settle against Agatha’s side. She laid on her stomach and looked down, her smile wide.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What story would you like to hear?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pouted and pretended to think as her arms circled around Rio once again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hmm, tell the one where my wife and our best friend’s husband get lost before their wedding. That’s a good one.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shot her a smirk.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We made it in time and you guys didn’t even know until after the wedding.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed, shooting her an accusing glare.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I can’t believe you lied to me for seven months!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio grinned, her hand playing with the neck of Agatha’s sleep shirt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You are so dramatic. I didn’t lie, I just didn’t mention it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pressed her hand to her heart and her face fell to a look of feigned mourning.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“The betrayal. All for a man. I knew this was how–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio pressed her hand over Agatha’s mouth, her eyes rolling.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh my god, shut up.” She dropped onto her back and stared up at the ceiling. “I’ll tell you the story of how I almost killed my now-wife when she flung herself from a moving vehicle.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha clicked submit on her final gift, feeling taxed, like she’d already worked an entire day.</p><p>She breathed out a sigh, her head dropping against the rest. No fit of tears followed, no sign of a panic attack incoming. With how her last week had gone, this felt like success. Even if, in the back of her mind, there was still this feeling of waiting for the other shoe to drop.<br/>
_______</p><p>An hour and a half after arriving at the office, Agatha finally tucked into the files of their current case.</p><p>The Cincinnati Field Office had picked up a seemingly mobile serial killer that had started in Alabama and crossed multiple state borders into Ohio. The killer’s MO was strange and gruesome. It wasn’t about the kill, at least not discernibly. It was about the moments just after, the dedicated slicework made of the victims’ flesh before they went cold, before livor mortis took hold.</p><p>Jen had left notations on the six autopsies completed so far ranging from <i>Whoever completed this Y-Incision on the first victim before the wounds were documented should be roasted in his own oven</i> to the far more useful <i>This is such a strange tool being used for the carving. Its edges are smooth but there are odd irregularities. If it’s an obsidian blade as the files state, the killer is incredibly patient.</i></p><p>The victimology was still uncertain. There was no correlation or pattern between the ages, races, genders, or sexual orientation of the victims and none had any connections to another.</p><p>They were all killed similarly; a toxic dose of formaldehyde, methanol, and phenol forcefully ingested. Jen had marked at the top of the file. <i>These are all substances used in embalming. With the use of an obsidian blade, we could be looking at something ritual.</i> The victims had been shaped into a prostrate position of worship and left in heavily wooded areas.</p><p>They’d had symbols carved into their faces, shoulders, back, and arms, most still yet to be identified. Two had been. The first was the Ancient Egyptian symbol of death, the scarab carved into the back of the victim’s neck. The second identified symbol was a hummingbird, assumed to be a representation of the Aztec god of sacrifice: Huitzilopochtli. Lilia had scribbled lower on the page. <i>The lack of consistency in the origin of the killer’s symbolism could lend itself toward their psyche or give us insight on their history. Most ritualistic killers are psychopathic with a sprinkling of sociopathic tendencies.</i></p><p>There was very little physical evidence beyond the repeating mantra written in the victim’s blood like a contract. ‘May thine death have more purpose than thine life in service of the Lord of Death.’ The paper was hard pressed and hand stained, the utensil used likely an ink pen. Alice’s note on this spoke to Agatha’s instinct. <i>This is so disconnected from possible religious texts, it feels almost as if it is a personally-written contract.</i></p><p>She was engrossed, deeply curious, and pleased at the amount of insight they’d carry into their meeting with the Agents from Cincinnati and Birmingham on Monday. Agatha had already penned her own thoughts into the margins of the shared documents, but she added more, her mind racing with theories. <i>It’s likely we’ll continue to identify these symbols as being from vastly different origins. There has to be something else connecting them.</i></p><p>Agatha dove into the research already done, the written languages already studied, in order to find a springing point. She filtered her search and spent the next three hours delving into ancient alphabets and symbolism. She was buzzing with excitement, her eyes straining as they flew from page to page. She was narrowing in on the largest symbol, the shape of it carved up the spine and flared into the shoulder-blades. She’d just clicked into an old document, preserved through imaging and restoration, when she heard the door to the command center open.</p><p>Agatha barely glanced up, noting the darkening sky outside, and ignored the sound, assuming it to be the cleaning crew. They could miss her office for a week.</p><p>She skimmed the information, a building excitement in her chest, when a figure appeared in her doorway.</p><p>She waved dismissively and clicked into the next page.</p><p>“Skip this one.”</p><p>Agatha scrolled and froze. She grinned sharply and murmured a quiet,</p><p>“Gotcha.”</p><p>It was the Sumerian symbol for Death.</p><p>Agatha looked up and nearly screamed as she took in Rio’s waiting form leaning against the doorframe. She looked amused, her eyes already searching.</p><p>“Found something interesting?”</p><p>Agatha simply stared. The victorious thrill of success had her riding a high that even Rio’s presence couldn’t diminish. She tried to steer it sharply into her continued irritation with the woman. It unfurled like a beast, but the weight of the last weeks, of the time between their heated, vitriolic encounters in Athens, had muffled it. Her voice still carried the proper amount of sharpness.</p><p>“Vidal, I would assume you have better things to do than to sniff after me and beg for scraps.”</p><p>Rio stepped easily into her office, her expression light, untouched by Agatha’s words.</p><p>“You know what they say about assuming.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio walked to the side of her desk, her head tilting, her dark eyes impossible to read.</p><p>“Your team has the day off. You should take them when you can.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes continued to glance toward the screens, itching to delve further into the symbol. She shrugged.</p><p>“I was bored.” She quickly marked down a few notes on the yellow pad of paper at her desk. “If that’s all, I’d appreciate the return of my peace.”</p><p>Rio sighed. Even her finely tuned control couldn’t hide the marks of exhaustion on her face.</p><p>“I didn’t come here to fight, Agatha. I came here to make sure you go home.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, fingers waving dismissively.</p><p>“A fruitless effort. Toodaloo.”</p><p>Instead of leaving, Rio moved and dropped into the seat across from Agatha's, her hands held out.</p><p>“Lay it on me then. What do you have?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, her lips turning down. Her irritation rose as she continued to be stalled in her pursuit.</p><p>“You’re wasting your time and mine. Go away.”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, brow lifting, and Agatha groaned.</p><p>She forced herself to refocus on her task, her pencil scratching out the three identified symbols in her notepad. She wrote their meanings and frowned. It didn’t make sense, Death, Death, and Sacrifice. Were the symbols repeating? Was there an order?</p><p>She began to search for the next symbol and tried to keep her mind from drifting to the irritatingly patient Rio watching her across the desk. She kept having to restart sentences, paragraphs, her mind split between two warring points of focus. She checked the clock. Two minutes had passed. It had felt like ten and Agatha nearly screamed in frustration.</p><p>She continued her research, everything taking doubly long as she cross-referenced the notes from the other field office. Eventually, she gave up.</p><p>She leaned back, her eyes narrowed as she took in Rio’s mild expression. She knew the several predetermined paths their conversations normally took would distract her entirely and she was close to something important. Instead of the scathing attack that had bubbled to her lips, Agatha shoved the case-file toward Rio, surprising them both.</p><p>Rio leaned forward and tugged the file into her lap. Without a word, she flipped it open and began to read.</p><p>Agatha breathed a quiet sigh of relief as soon as Rio’s eyes were no longer touching every part of her skin. She spent the next forty-five minutes in the trenches of ancient languages and alphabets, flicking through pages of Arabic, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Aramaic in an effort to locate a familiar symbol. She grew frustrated, <i>something</i> spinning around in the back of her mind, and looked up.</p><p>Rio hadn’t spoken since the file touched her hands. Her brow was furrowed in deep concentration as she flipped through the pages of it. Agatha couldn’t pull her eyes away.</p><p>She wanted to be annoyed, but she had always adored the way Rio worked. Unlike her general composure– the vacant mask– a deeply-concentrated Rio was open, unguarded. Agatha had long-ago memorized the subtle tics; the way her fingers tapped when she was struggling to find connections, the way she bit the inside of her cheek when she became impatient with a specific task or document she needed to complete, the way she’d mouth her theories silently, patching the case together in such a startling way that Agatha had always found impressive. Her favorite had been the head tilts, like a cat caught on a surprising sound or a glint of light.</p><p>Rio didn’t move but her voice sounded quietly into the room.</p><p>“Do you have something you want to say or are you waiting for your file back?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t give Rio the satisfaction of embarrassment at being caught. She shrugged.</p><p>“I was hoping you had something useful to share since you’re taking up oxygen in my office.”</p><p>Rio closed the file with a smile.</p><p>“I have thoughts.” She slowly stood, then dragged the chair to Agatha's side without asking and resettled. “Care to show me what had you so pleased when I walked in?”</p><p>Agatha could smell her cologne, the warmth of it curling in her lungs. She leaned away and cleared her throat, shoving her notepad in Rio’s direction.</p><p>“I found another symbol’s meaning. Death, Death, Sacrifice. I’ve been looking for the marks on the shoulder but haven’t come across anything close so far.”</p><p>Rio looked at the yellow paper.</p><p>“The Sumerian language was isolated to a portion of Southern Mesopotamia for its duration. There’s probably not many civilizations that used it before it died out.” She ran her thumb across the symbol. “Have you looked into those?”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. She had not. She leaned forward, typing quickly to try and snuff out the way Rio’s remarkable intelligence never failed to impress itself upon her. She’d taken courses throughout her years as an agent, delving into a wide variety of her own personal curiosities without a single complaint. She was constantly learning, constantly evolving.</p><p>Agatha wondered if Rio still took courses now, she wondered what might interest the now SAC of the Washington Field Office. Recognizing the direction her mind was taking her, Agatha cleared her throat and read her findings out loud.</p><p>“The major periods were the Ubaid period, the Uruk period, the Early Dynastic period, the Akkadian Empire period, the Gutian period, and the Third Dynasty of Ur.”</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together in thought and it struck Agatha in that moment that neither of them were trying to jab or undermine or antagonize the other. She glossed over it quickly, forcing her own head back on track. She began to click through the brief summaries of the periods to gain a better understanding and stopped in the Early Dynastic Period.</p><p>“It can’t be the first two.”</p><p>Rio blinked as if she hadn’t been paying attention, her head tilting slightly.</p><p>“Of course, written language didn’t begin in that region until the Early Dynastic.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Of course.” She held out a hand. “Do you plan to share with the class?”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, her body heat radiating out as she pointed at the screen. Her sleeve slid against Agatha’s shoulder and Agatha held her breath.</p><p>“Look at the Third Dynasty of Ur. See if you find anything about human sacrifices.”</p><p>Agatha did. She’d barely scrolled two pages before the first mentions of a burial ritual cropped up. Rio moved in for a better vantage, the touch of their arms solidifying, as they both read through the meat of it. Court members killed with the belief that they would serve and protect the deceased in the afterlife.</p><p>Agatha hummed, her lips pressed tightly in thought. She searched for further information but came up with little.</p><p>“Could the killer be preparing to take his victims into the afterlife?”</p><p>Rio shrugged and sat back.</p><p>“It’s possible. That would likely mean he was dying or planning to kill himself.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at the pad of paper with a frown.</p><p>“That doesn’t work. Why involve Aztec and Egyptian imagery if he was only following the ideology of a single civilization?” Agatha stared at the symbols further until an idea simmered in the back of her head. She quickly searched the two with relation to human sacrifice and grinned. “That’s the connection. Ancient Egypt’s practice was very similar to Ur’s, but the Aztecs were different. Theirs was a sacrifice to their god to prevent an endless night.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up and she looked so young as she stood and walked to William’s desk. Agatha thought she might sit behind it, but instead she unplugged his laptop and carried it back to her seat. She flipped open the computer and Agatha watched as she logged into a guest profile.</p><p>Rio looked up and Agatha locked her features to keep from reacting to the quiet excitement she found aimed in her direction.</p><p>“I think we focus on human sacrifice. If we can name the major civilizations, we can likely find the origin of most of the killer’s symbology.”</p><p>Agatha quickly returned her attention to the screen, swallowing past the pressure in her chest. She made a silent covenant with herself that she wouldn’t look at Rio for the remainder of whatever <i>this</i> was. It was too soft, too reminiscent of a time long-past.<br/>
________</p><p>Two hours later, the sun well and truly set, Agatha and Rio were halfway through one of Sharon’s bottles of wine.</p><p>Rio had grabbed the neck of it ten minutes into the start of their reinvigorated search and let out a huff as she twisted the cap off.</p><p>“Have you tried this shit? She gave me some when I hired her and I almost changed my mind.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched in amusement before she could stop it. She pulled the bottle to her lips to mask it and took a long drink, her face twisting as the tang hit the back of her throat.</p><p>“It’s disgusting. I imagine Sharon burned out her taste buds on the testing of it. She can probably shoot gasoline and battery acid.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, the sound low, and Agatha looked down at her notes as it zipped through her, a pulse of something electric.</p><p>They’d gotten quiet, both so engrossed in the thousands of words and the influx of history that was new to Agatha but probably a refresher for Rio. Conversation returned only when they found something of note. They had several false finds, and with each one, Agatha considered packing up for the night. It was past seven now, past the time any normal person would remain at work if they didn’t have to. She was entirely alone in this office with Rio reading under the lamplight and the shine of screens.</p><p>She felt warm, her legs tingling with the onset of the wine’s effects, and, quite suddenly, this had become a very dangerous place for her to remain.</p><p>But she stayed. Through two more leads that carried them to dead ends. Through the grazes of their fingers when the bottle was passed between them. Through Rio shifting closer to read the small text of the current document on Agatha’s screen, her knee leaning against Agatha’s. Through the way Rio didn’t readjust when she returned to her own laptop.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned with the intensity with which she looked at her computer, desperate not to look anywhere else. She changed sources, the words on the screen blurring slightly as they loaded, and her heart surged in her chest. Without thought, she reached out, gripping Rio’s arm to get her attention.</p><p>“The marks on the shoulders, Rio, it’s a symbol and a word!” She felt the muscle tense under her fingers, felt the movement as Rio leaned closer. It took more effort than it should’ve to withdraw her hand, her heartbeat pounding in her chest. “Tell me what you know about Stonehenge.”</p><p>Rio took a moment to respond and her voice was hoarse.</p><p>“Not a lot is confirmed. I don’t want to dash your hopes, but there’s no civilization that is connected to its construction.”</p><p>Agatha nodded absently.</p><p>“Yes, but if one were to be?”</p><p>Rio answer came out evenly.</p><p>“Ancient Britons.”</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“The scratches across the left shoulder is Brythonic. It means sacrifice. And the cuts that surround the word are in the shape of the ruins of Stonehenge”</p><p>Rio’s response came out with an edge of petulance.</p><p>“Your killer doesn’t know anything about history.”</p><p>Agatha looked. She couldn’t stop herself. She turned and found Rio nearly pouting at the screen, her thoughts on their killer somehow colored even more negatively by the fact that whomever they were was playing make-believe with historical facts.</p><p>Agatha’s body was alight with adrenaline, of finding the needle in the haystack after hours of dredging through photocopied and scanned texts. The wine had run its expected course, had softened her edges until they were dull and unrecognizable.</p><p>Rio, this wildly intelligent, obstinate woman, was sulking because a psychopath dared to interpret history within their delusion.</p><p>Agatha’s fingertips smoothed against the corner of Rio’s downturned lips.</p><p>Rio’s gaze lifted, her attention shifting sharply.</p><p>The temperature in the room seemed to blaze from their point of connection and Agatha couldn’t breathe. She was entranced, drawn back into a time when she could touch Rio like this at a whim. When Rio’s quirks, the things that <i>made</i> her, had been a steady source of joy in Agatha’s world.</p><p>Rio didn’t move, didn’t seem to be breathing. She looked lost, her eyes a window to her fear and confusion and the hope that seeped through all of it.</p><p>It was what stilled Agatha’s hand, what brought Alder’s words ringing sharply in her ears. <i>”The connection you have with Rio is powerful, Agatha. For both of you. I know I don’t have to tell you that such behavior can really hamper the progress you’re trying to make.</i></p><p>Agatha withdrew, her lungs burning, her eyes stinging. She quickly stood, her chair flying back and bumping the wall. She winced at the sound of it as she moved toward the door of her office.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha slowed, her eyes closing as she held onto her threadbare restraint. Rio’s voice was desperate. It held pleas and need and so much longing that Agatha thought she might crumble. She wanted to so much that it terrified her. She ached in a part of herself that had been dormant even before Nicky’s death, that, now stirring to wakefulness, left her exposed. She drew in a ragged breath.</p><p>“I’ll make sure the team is aware of your assistance in this case.”</p><p>The words were so meaningless, so far from the ones that wanted to fall out behind them, and Agatha clenched her teeth together tightly.</p><p>She walked away, leaving Rio alone. Again.</p>

<p>Agatha drove home in a pensive, silence, her last words to Rio weighing heavily. She held her hands tight to the wheel and tried to keep her breathing stable despite the feel of Rio’s lips under her fingers replaying on a loop in her mind. The momentary reprieve she’d found when she was tucked away in her office had been stripped and filled with crashing memories of Rio, of the life they’d inhabited together before it all fell apart. The years of happiness that came before the tragedy that had swallowed her whole and spit her out a bitter, grief-stricken crone.</p><p>She tried to complete the exercises that had helped her with Alder, tried to focus on the sound of the heat blasting through the car, the horns of traffic surrounding her, the sight of Christmas lights still thrown over and wrapped around trees. She felt the leather under her hands and instead of settling at the feel of the stitching on her skin, she sank into a bottomless pool.</p><p>
<i>Agatha heaved out a breath as she sprinted the last legs of her morning run. Her legs were jelly, her strides occurring due to rhythm versus intentional effort. She could hear the breaths of Vidal behind her, the agent competitive to a fault.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They were nine weeks into their eighteen-week training program and Agatha was on top of the world. She’d broken a twelve-year record and cemented herself as a top candidate in the cohort right next to Vidal and Maximoff. Her mother couldn’t contact her here, couldn’t visit unless she allowed it, and she had, of course, never allowed it. She was as free as she’d ever been from her clutches and her future was a cannon aimed in the exact right direction.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She heard Vidal closing in, the perfect form of her strides and the straight line of her spine all driving her to a certain victory. It was always like this. From the first days of their training, Agatha had watched her. She’d seen the subtle way Vidal would show up, show out, and disappear only to rinse and repeat day after day. Unlike Maximoff, who’d felt so much like a goody-two-shoes with her perfectly worn uniform and her relentless willingness to <i>show</i> how good she was, Vidal was a panther. Every blow was a killing blow, she won like it was a forgone conclusion, and Agatha had been curious.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Seeing her fall out of a smoking vehicle, blood pouring profusely from her nose, streaming down her neck, and destroying the collar of her uniform while she defended Agatha’s admittedly poor decision to leap from a moving car, Agatha had become captivated. And because she had never been one to mince words or hesitate, Agatha had confronted her hours later in the medical center.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She still hadn’t wrapped her mind around the answer she’d received.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It worked, didn’t it? Maybe next time, keep me in the loop.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had pondered the words ceaselessly for the next five days, her best guess centering around the fact that it allowed Vidal to, once more, win. She had been accredited, R. Vidal right next to A. Harkness in the permanent records of the facility.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha didn’t get it. She was personally pleased with the attention that came from getting ahead, being the best. It provided her power, it gave her choices. She was nowhere near Maximoff’s level of forward with her knowledge and skill, she preferred to let her actions speak for her, but she didn’t hide away after it happened. If Vidal wanted to win so badly, why did she stay so quiet?</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha picked up her pace, knowing that Vidal was gearing up for her final push. It had happened like this for the five days they’d been running together.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The morning after their incident at Hogan’s Alley, she had stepped outside, ready to stretch, and found Vidal waiting in Agatha’s usual spot in the freshly cut grass. Both of her eyes had dark rings around them due to the impact to her nose and there was a thin bandage placed under her chin. She looked entirely unbothered, her eyes lifting up to find Agatha staring at her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had shrugged and joined her in the grass a bit away, her body only scraped and deeply bruised on her shoulder and right hip. She’d expected Vidal to take off once she was finished with her warm-up, but she’d stalled. When Agatha had purposefully slowed her exercises to get a better understanding, Vidal had sighed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Can you put your ass in gear, Harkness?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d grinned, coy, and continued her slow progression.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, so you <i>were</i> here for me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal had looked toward the trail with impatience, her calves flexing with every bounce of her feet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m about to be gone.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had laughed and finished her leg swings, her body warm enough to begin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal had been in that same spot in the grass every morning since. They hadn’t spoken much outside of competitive snipes and digs at the start; and those had faded as they pushed themselves beyond their normal strides, their normal times, their normal efforts.</i>
</p><p>
<i>And Rio always won. It was infuriating. She’d ride easy behind Agatha for the last five hundred meters before she’d fly past in the final fifteen.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Not today.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha could feel the start of a cramp in her lungs and swore. Sweat was pouring into her eyes, her lungs were screaming, and she was certain the moment she slowed or stopped, she would collapse.</i>
</p><p>
<i>As the corner of the dormitory came into view, she heard the telltale shift of Vidal’s effort behind her. Agatha waited until she saw the sole of Vidal’s shoes just aligning with her ankle; with every reserve of energy stored in her body, she propelled herself forward, her arms pumping, her form remaining streamlined even as her body wanted to curl in on itself and collapse.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had never pushed herself in such a way in her twenty five years of life and it <i>hurt,</i> but it also felt like an evolution.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her feet flew across the grass, bounced across the sidewalk, and carried her to the same patch of grass they stretched in every morning. She heard the barest echoes of Vidal behind her still and a viciously wide grin took over her face as she crossed the finish line.</i>
</p><p>
<i>All at once, her body repaid her overexertion.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She had to adjust her legs giving out into a sideways dive, her already bruised hip hitting and cutting into the grass with a hefty impact. She slid several feet and fell to her back, her head spinning and her lungs faltering in their purpose to provide oxygen. She couldn’t see much of the sky through the sweat in her eyes and her ears were ringing as the euphoria turned to nausea.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal spoke but Agatha couldn’t even consider a response as she painfully rolled to her knees and vomited in the grass. The one-eighty from victory to delirious sickness was violently unpleasant, her elbows pressing into dewy, cold grass, her mouth hanging open as drool fell from it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She felt a hand against her back as she threw up again, the remaining small amount of breakfast she’d gotten down before the run now half-digested in the grass. She spit and rolled to the side, knocking into Vidal’s thighs where she knelt beside her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal gripped her shoulder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sit up, you crazy fuck.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha groaned as she heaved in breath after breath. She allowed herself to be lugged into a sitting position and felt the cold press of a water bottle against her palms. Her hands shook as she lifted it to her lips and pulled a small amount, the liquid a trickle of relief to her now-raw throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Over the next two minutes, Agatha’s nausea and dizziness began to fade. She drank small sips of water until she felt safe enough sucking the bottle dry and then crumpled it and fell back against the grass, angling away from her sick.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I won.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal was still beside her and Agatha peeked her eyes open to find the woman staring at her in shock and reluctant admiration.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She shot Agatha an unimpressed look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ve never had to puke after a victory.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha weakly threw her hands up before they collapsed back on the grass. She coughed and tasted the leftover bile in her throat with a grimace.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh god.” She closed her eyes. “I need a nap.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal patted her leg in the most patronizing manner.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’ll be getting Combat Training instead. I’d suggest brushing your teeth before you put anyone in a chokehold.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No, it’ll be a secret weapon in case I get in a tough spot.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal laughed and it brought something to life in Agatha’s chest. It sounded low and surprised, like she hadn’t expected it, and Agatha thought she might enjoy hearing it again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s actually disgusting, Harkness.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha finally found the energy to roll to her feet. She stumbled slightly and blinked against the dizzy rush, her head now pounding. Crumpled water bottle in hand, she tilted her head toward the dorms and Vidal moved easily beside her.<br/>__________</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d brushed her teeth despite her threat, and found herself infinitely glad after she ended up submitting Vidal in an Ezekiel choke from the bottom position, her arm locked behind the base of her head, the other cinching it in place. Vidal struggled against the hold, her hips slotted between Agatha’s legs, her hands dragging at Agatha’s arms. She was barely breathing, her face pressed tightly into Agatha’s shoulder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>After several attempts, Vidal tapped.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha released her, smiling, and found Vidal pulling herself away with a dazed expression, her lips turned down in a frown.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal stood and held out a hand to pull Agatha to her feet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“When did you have time to master that? We just learned it last week.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shrugged, rolling her neck out. Her body was buzzing with adrenaline.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I come in here and spar when I can.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>They picked up their waters, taking a short breather, and Vidal looked around the room. Their cohort members were in various states of grapples and chokes, some breaking apart, others restarting.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“With who?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha used her shirt to dry the sweat off of her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Maximoff, usually.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s brows lifted, her amusement clear.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You hate Maximoff.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha feigned shock.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I do not! I find her annoying, that’s very different. How do you even know that?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal dropped her water bottle down and chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You roll your eyes every time she answers a question in class. Like, every single time.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The statement stuck out to Agatha and she gave a playful raise of her brows.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I didn’t realize you were watching me so often.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was meant as a playful jab, nothing more. Agatha was a flirt; her awakening in college had been two-fold. She loved sex, loved the sensuality of her body, but she also loved the power of words, she loved to put others on the back foot.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Instead, Vidal raised her brow, expression almost serious.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Of course, Harkness. You have to keep your eye on the competition.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s tone was low, challenging, and Agatha didn’t look away from the heat that flared between them. Interesting. It had happened a few times, a goad or jab that overstepped, a look that lingered a moment too long, but this… Agatha lifted her chin, tilted her head, and smirked.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s matching grin had Agatha’s heart rate skyrocketing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She held out her hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Ready to go again?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s palm slid against hers, and, under the clammy skin and sweat, it felt charged.<br/>__________</i>
</p><p>
<i>The next week went similarly, their mornings starting with an aggressive run, both of them pushing, fighting for first. Vidal still won most times, her stride an inch longer, her lungs like machines. Agatha did not throw up again but she got very, very close the few times she managed to keep the lead. Soon, Vidal was joining her at odd hours for further sparring and grappling training.</i>
</p><p>
<i>After their conversation about it, Agatha had knocked on Vidal’s door with a prickly anticipation stirring in her chest. She had memorized the dorm rooms of her entire cohort by week two.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She enjoyed Vidal. She liked how Vidal talked, how little she needed to say to get a point across. She liked Vidal’s confidence. It bordered on cocky by the sole honesty of her skill. Agatha had taken to watching her too, studying her easy interactions with the remainder of the cohort. Everything about Vidal screamed competence. But there was more to her, sitting like a alligator under the surface of the water, and Agatha was finding herself desperate to know.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha also found herself changing her nightly routines.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Prior, she would go with her cohort to the closest bars to wind down and play pool or darts. She wasn’t particularly close to any of them, not like a few had become, but it was easy fun. Sometimes Agatha’s attention would be drawn to a woman and she’d waste her charm and few funds buying her drinks and getting handsy with her in bathrooms. Other times, when the liquor hit her too strongly, she’d wind up pressing one of her other cohort members into their door-room door.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It had only happened a handful of times, three to be exact, and never with the same person. So far, it hadn’t gotten her into any horrible situations. Maximoff had been fun, intense, rough; she’d spoken to Agatha the next day like they hadn’t been three fingers deep in one another just eight hours prior.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Barlowe had been a bit of a different story, a little too soft, a little too sweet. She’d been eager but inexperienced and Agatha had given more than she’d expected to receive.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Putnam was a short-lived experience. She might have been incredible if Agatha hadn’t found out she was engaged while she had her mouth on her cunt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She didn’t regret her pursuits. They were helpful, they allowed any excess energy to drain off through responsible means while she pursued a dream that had been long in the making. But now, instead of falling into whatever group happened to be leaving the facilities, Agatha would wait.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Sometimes she would knock loudly on Vidal’s door and drag her toward the training room. Other times, she would leave her door open, a book in her lap, and Vidal would walk by and pause, waiting for Agatha to join her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d work on new skills or hone the ones they struggled to master. There was never a lot of conversation. Similar to their runs, their spars became a competition. They’d go too hard, so lost in the adrenaline and the anticipation of victory. Agatha was proud to come out on top more often than not, her arms longer, her instincts minutely sharper.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She expected tonight would be no different. Agatha held her book in her hands and waited. And waited. Finally, when Agatha’s anticipation had turned just south of sour, Vidal appeared.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She didn’t wait by the door this time.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Instead, she walked right into Agatha’s room and dropped heavily on the edge of the bed, her body knocking gently into Agatha’s feet. Agatha felt a thrill in her veins at this unexpected change to their routine. At the fact that Vidal hadn’t even asked before invading her space and dropping unceremoniously to her bed. Nobody had come in here before, Agatha hadn’t wanted them to.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal groaned tiredly, her arm thrown over her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m not sparring tonight.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stared at the small bump on her nose, the way it lifted softly at the end. She studied the razor line of her jaw and the way her throat moved when she swallowed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t go all soft on me now, Vidal.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal lifted her arm to glare at Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We run a 5k every morning with increasingly absurd speeds and close out our nights with an hour of battering one another. Not to mention our assigned work and classes. You’re telling me your bones don’t hurt?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha raised her brows.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you track our times?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s arm dropped back down, her lips curling into a grin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We’ve both broken our PRs like five times.” She rotated her arm, her face twisting in a grimace. “You also nearly dislocated my shoulder last night.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nudged Vidal in the ribs with her toe.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t be such a baby.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s free hand caught Agatha’s by her ankle, her fingers pressing lightly into her muscle. She pushed her foot away but didn’t let go.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think we should skip training and drink. And then skip our morning run because we’ll feel like shit. We have a late-start tomorrow. It’s the perfect time to slack.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had no intention of saying no. She also had no intention of making that obvious.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hmm, I don’t know…”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s fingers pressed into the muscle of her foot.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re full of shit.” She rolled to her feet. “I’m going to shower and get changed. I’ll leave in twenty with or without you, Harkness.”<br/>__________</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had done the same and thrown on jeans and a light-brown cotton button-up. She spent twelve of her twenty minutes trying to dry her hair and had mostly succeeded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When Vidal had reappeared in her doorway, Agatha had felt warmth surge through her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal was attractive. It wasn’t something Agatha was just now realizing. But she’d never seen her out of her uniform. More specifically, she’d never seen her in her own clothing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal had on a pair of straight-leg blue jeans, black Docs, and a simple, black t-shirt that sat loose against her athletic frame. Agatha had overheated. She’d felt the need to clear her throat but she’d refrained and grabbed her wallet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Now, both of them were tucked into the corner booth of a bar just a little further away in hopes that they wouldn’t run into the likely already-drunk portion of their cohort. Vidal had grabbed a pitcher and two glasses and dropped across from Agatha with a groan.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I feel like I’ve been put in a rock tumbler and left for weeks.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed, pouring both of them a pint of what looked like a perfectly shitty beer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t know what that is.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal huffed, pulling her glass toward her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That thing they always advertised on tv.” She tilted her head in thought. “You put a bunch of rocks inside a cylinder with grit and water and over time it polishes them.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha raised her brow, lips curling in a smirk as she drank. Her tone was teasing when she responded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Very cool.” For the first time since Agatha had started paying attention, she saw the hint of a blush on Vidal’s cheeks. The warmth from earlier hadn’t gone away and the tendrils of it wrapped around Agatha’s chest. Agatha reached her foot out and nudged Vidal’s knee, her expression softening. “It probably is cool. I wasn’t allowed to watch television growing up so I wouldn’t know.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Instead of the normal guffaws and lamenting that had come from her college friends, Vidal shrugged in acceptance, her own teasing smile on her lips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“TV is a waste of time anyway. How will you become the ultimate try-hard if you waste your time on it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mouth dropped in offense.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I am not the try-hard, that’s Maxifmoff.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal gave her a dismissive look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Maximoff doesn’t do nearly as much as you.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You work just as hard as I do.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Now I do.”<br/>__________</i>
</p><p>
<i>Their night continued through the first pitcher, both of them careless with their intake, lost in the easy connection, the conversation that ebbed and flowed so naturally.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha walked back to their table with a second pitcher, her body thrumming with the golden glow of a buzz teetering on drunk. She scooted further in this time, round the curve of the red pleather cushion so that she was only a couple feet from Vidal. She sloshed a little of the amber liquid over the side and swore, using a napkin to wipe it up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Eight dollars for a pitcher is a steal.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal took a long pull.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I can’t wait until I’m happy to be buying craft.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You have a few years to go. Our early salary is chump change.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal shrugged, her eyes nearing wistful.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’ll be a relief, whatever it is.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha considered prying, considered pushing at the soft spot to see what gave, but she refrained. There was something here, something that excited her, and, for once, she wanted to be careful.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Who of our cohort do you think will burn out?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal grinned, her earthy, brown eyes falling to Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Bohner.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Both of them snickered, then fell into full-blown laughter encouraged by the alcohol running through their bodies.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had tears in her eyes by the time she stopped, her chest rising and falling as a few more laughs made their way out. She wiped her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ve never seen somebody money shift going twelve miles an hour.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s lips were still pulled in a wide smile.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I thought the transmission was going to fall out. Agent Gassik has never run so fast in his life. He nearly dragged Bohner through the window to get him to stop.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha almost snorted her beer and she coughed as the scene replayed in her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Anyone else?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m sure there’s five or six that’ll drop. Whether they decide it’s not for them or they burn out.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Think Maximoff will burn out?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal shot her a look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think that’s about as likely as you or me burning out.” Agatha rolled her eyes and Vidal seemed to narrow in on her, head tilting curiously. “For somebody you fucked within a week of being here, you sure seem to dislike her.” Vidal’s eyes widened in feigned shock. “Did she break your heart?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha grimaced and reached over to shove her. She noted Vidal seemed to be closer when she righted herself.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“First of all, how do you know that? Second of all, I don’t get attached.” She shrugged. “It was fun though. If you’re considering it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s comment was meant to gain information, and by the look on Vidal’s face, she knew it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal shook her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No, I’m not looking to shit where I sleep.” She took a sip, grinned. “Oh, and she told me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Fucking Maximoff. She wasn’t sure what her actual name was or she’d curse it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I like to let off a little steam. It’s harmless.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Right. So if you don’t hate her, and you aren’t secretly in love with her, what exactly is your problem?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Maximoff’s words rang in her ears. They’d been laying on the floor in Maximoff’s room, both of them half-dressed, and Maximoff had gone spouting her mouth. <i>”Sometimes it seems like you’re so good at everything you do because you’re running from something.”</i></i>
</p><p>
<i>It had been unnecessary, even as a sideways compliment, and the words had hit far too close to home.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pursed her lips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“She’s a know-it-all. A teacher’s pet.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Does being skilled and knowing the answers to questions make one a teacher’s pet?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha bristled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t know, Vidal. Why don’t you go find Maximoff if you think she’s so fucking cool.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s brows raised, her mouth pulling in a grin. She stared at Agatha, studied her, then chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Nah, I’m where I want to be.”<br/>_________</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If I’d known you were so fucking bad at pool, I’d have brought you out sooner.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal shot her a glare, her eyes lidded in the dim bar, the old pool stick held loosely in her hands.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m not bad, you hustled me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha lined up her next shot and sunk the 4 into the corner pocket with a flourish. She winked at Vidal, her ego thoroughly stroked, and saw a distinct shift occur.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal had kept things light, their conversation never veering into dangerous territory even when the avenues opened before them. She was clever and quick with her commentary and did not shy away from Agatha’s quick temper. But now, as Agatha leaned in for her next shot, she could feel the heat of Vidal’s gaze on her very differently. Instead of curious amusement, she felt as if she was suddenly being caressed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha always knew when she had somebody’s attention. She didn’t fail to put on a show.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She arched slightly as she fired off her next shot, the 6 ball spinning into the middle pocket. When she looked up, she found Vidal already looking. The playfulness had grown to something with teeth and Agatha sucked in a slow breath.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Should I miss so you stay in the game?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>If her voice was breathy, low, she wouldn’t apologize. She was entranced by this woman. She had to know.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal tilted her head, her hair haloed by the bright light that shone on the pool table. She gave Agatha an amused look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“They way I slow down so you can win some mornings?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mouth dropped open, her eyes wide with refusal.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You. Do. Not.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal shrugged dismissively.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I had to feed your massive ego.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha missed her next shot and it wasn’t on purpose.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal moved in, walked to stand beside Agatha, waited for her to move.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha looked up the small distance, letting Vidal take up her space, their bodies inches apart.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re lying.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal stepped into her, the knuckles holding the pool stick grazing Agatha’s stomach. She leaned in, so close to Agatha’s lips that she had to fight to stay still, and spoke honey into her ear.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m lying.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She nudged Agatha then, moving her out of the way for her next shot.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hadn’t moved much and she stared as Vidal’s perfect ass and muscular thighs brushed against her. Vidal stood and rounded the table.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She must have made her shot, but Agatha hadn’t seen it. She blinked, looked up, and found Vidal grinning at her from across the green.<br/>___________</i>
</p><p>
<i>Near midnight, Agatha and Vidal were well and truly hammered. Both of them stumbled toward the exit, their panicked amusement coming out in shushes and giggles as they made their way outside and began to run.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha knew she was slurring her words slightly as she called out.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I thought we were skipping the exercise, Vidal.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s pronunciation wasn’t much better.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Maybe if you had kept an eye on the time and stopped distracting me, we wouldn’t have to run to make curfew.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed, her heart racing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Please, tell me how I was distracting you?” They turned on the street heading to the entrance of the base. “You nearly mounted the table trying to make your last shot and you sent the fucking cue ball flying off!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>They reached the entrance with four minutes to spare, the officer at the gate shooting them a look of warning.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They slowed to a jog as they made their way to the dorms and Agatha expected that the timeframe for Vidal to answer her question had passed. They fell silent in the hallway, their footsteps light until they reached Agatha’s room.</i>
</p><p>
<i>A wave of disappointment surged through Agatha’s chest at the prospect of the night ending. She was wide awake even if she was drunk. She wanted… she didn’t know what, but she <i>wanted.</i> She opened her door, expecting to turn and say goodnight, and felt Vidal’s shoulder bump hers as she stepped into the room with her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha held her breath as she closed the door quickly behind them, her heart in her throat. She turned to find Vidal face-planted on her bed, taking up the entirety of the surface area with her legs and arms kicked out wide.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha grinned, laughed, then stepped closer to shove her to the side.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Have a little decency. You’re a guest in my home.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha dropped down beside her because it felt right, because the idea of standing, of losing the opportunity to be so close to her was not an option in her drunken state. She half-fell on Vidal’s arm and shoulder, their sides pressed against one another, their calves brushing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha slapped lazily at her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Take off your shoes.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal tried valiantly, futilely, her laces keeping her boot locked in place. She groaned loudly and went boneless.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Too hard.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha kicked her shoes off, sending them across the floor, and dragged herself to a sitting position. She crawled toward Vidal’s boots with the coordination of a toddler and half-laid on Vidal’s calves as she reached for her laces.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her fingers were clumsy as she tried to pull the knot. She wrapped her arm around one of Vidal’s legs to hold it still even though it wasn’t moving.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I hate your shoes.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal scoffed loudly and tried to dislodge Agatha, her ankle wiggling, the boot almost clocking Agatha in the face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You don’t deserve to touch them!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha cackled, her arm tightening as she tried valiantly to loosen the knot. She let out an ‘oof’ as the toe of the boot bumped her chin and quickly put pressure on the joint to lock her foot in place, all while her fit of laughter continued. Vidal joined in, her efforts sluggish and weak as she tried to escape.</i>
</p><p>
<i>With a grandiose effort, Agatha loosened the first boot, her fingers yanking to loosen the laces. She shoved at the boot until it slid off Vidal’s foot.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She sucked in a breath, her lungs aching and her face hurting from her laughter, and felt Vidal still under her. Looking back, she glared.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Can we truce until I get your other shoe off?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal was still on her stomach, her face pressed into Agatha’s pillow, but she peered down and blew her hair from her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Truce.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha heaved in a breath and released her hold, using both hands to tug at the laces. She slid the boot from Vidal’s foot and sighed loudly as she pushed up on her knees. With a great heave, she tossed herself back beside Vidal.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re welcome, you bitch.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal shoved at her, left her hand on Agatha’s side, her fingers pressing into Agatha’s abdomen. She didn’t say anything for several moments, almost a minute, then;</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You look good when you think you’re better than everyone else.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stilled, her abs tightening against the warmth of Rio’s palm, her body reacting sharply to the comment. She had been turned on from the first time Vidal had pressed her ass against her. She let her head roll to the side and caught Vidal’s gaze.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pulled in a weak breath. She looked at the way Vidal’s lashes brushed her cheeks when she blinked, the slight bunch of her lips against the fabric of the pillow, the line of her jaw as it clenched.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I must look good all the time.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s eyes flashed, something hot and dangerous that sent a thrill through Agatha. The fingers on Agatha’s stomach shifted, pressed firmer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You do.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha could see the way her own chest rose and fell, knew that Rio was seeing it too. She shifted her legs and her breathing stuttered at the ache between them. She was no stranger to being pursued, no stranger to being wanted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But Vidal did it like she did everything else. A forgone conclusion. A decision already made. A victory already won. Agatha clung to her equal footing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I thought you didn’t have any interest in shitting where you sleep?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s hand rubbed patterns on Agatha’s stomach, just above the waist of her jeans. Her fingers slipped under the band and stayed there.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Something tells me it’ll be worth the risk to tear you off your perfect little pedestal.” Her voice was gritty, dirty, and she pushed herself to her side so she was facing Agatha. Her fingers moved lower but stilled again. “How long have you been thinking about me fucking you?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha thought she might catch fire. She reached out, her hand on Vidal’s jaw, her thumb brushing lightly over the mostly-healed bruising under her eye. Her skin was just as soft as it looked and Agatha turned to face her, her lips parting as Vidal’s hand slid further with the movement.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Who says I was?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s lips lifted, smug, and her fingers moved to cup Agatha through her underwear. Both of them moaned at the heat, the slick patch of fabric paperthin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes closed, her hips lifted into the touch.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fuck.” She pressed the back of her hand over her mouth and panted into it. “Vidal.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal chuckled and she let her fingers drag through her cunt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think you can call me Rio when I’m inside you, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha liked the way her name sounded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio hummed, fingers stroking lightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wanted to kill herself for her next words.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t want sex to make this weird.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio withdrew, but her hand settled on the button of Agatha’s jeans. She flipped it open, pushed the zipper down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We can enjoy each other in more than one way, Agatha.” She pressed her fingers beneath Agatha’s underwear this time, her digits slipping between her folds. “I’m perfectly capable of being your friend and–” She pressed teasingly at her entrance. “– providing some benefits.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mouth dropped open, her back arching off the bed as Rio’s fingers dragged up and circled her clit. Her hand dropped from Rio’s face and fisted in her t-shirt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Jesus– I– fuck, Rio.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha didn’t say that she wasn’t worried about Rio. She didn’t say that she’d never felt this kind of draw to another person before. She didn’t say that she had the strangest feeling she would be the one to ruin this. She didn’t say anything.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She yanked Rio on top of her and kissed her roughly, the kiss filthy and wet and just as devastating as Agatha thought it might be. She moaned into Rio’s mouth and wrapped her arms around her neck as Rio sunk two fingers into her, slid out, pressed three.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tried to lift herself off and her hand slipped as it found purchase on the book Agatha had tossed to her pillow. Rio pulled back and threw the book across the room.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha made an indignant– if breathy– sound and tried to partially sit up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal rolled her eyes, shoving Agatha back onto her bed by her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I <i>know</i> you haven’t read a single word of that fucking paperback. Find another way to pretend you’re not waiting for me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She kissed her again, her tongue pressing into her mouth, warm and strong against Agatha’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s body trembled, her breathing ragged, and she almost whined as Rio slid in a third finger and it felt like it wasn’t nearly enough. Agatha pulled her mouth away to pant out;</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Strap, third drawer.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s teeth sunk into her neck, her body tensing. Her voice was gravely when she spoke.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Are you sure?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pushed at her shoulder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes, go.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio rolled off of her, stumbled to her drawer, and Agatha kicked off her jeans and socks with medium effort.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She heard Rio slide the drawer open and the slide of denim, the clink of metal, and the groan of leather. Agatha’s hand fell against her own clit, the lack of stimulation making her desperate.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When Rio stepped back into view Agatha’s core clenched on nothing. Rio’s olive skin was so pretty against the black straps and the purple cock bouncing between her legs had never looked better.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha reached out, gripped the harness, and yanked Rio back toward her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fuck me or I’ll do it myself.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes bore into hers, her head tilting as she took in Agatha’s hand between her legs.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Looks like you already are.” She stroked a hand along the silicone and it shouldn’t have looked as hot as it did. “Should I just watch?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was torn, she wanted to withdraw so Rio could get on with it, but she was so fucking close. She could go for a second. Agatha closed her eyes and kept circling her clit, a whine leaving her lips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hand closed around her wrist, stilled her, pulled Agatha’s hand free. She pressed Agatha’s hand over her head as she knelt down on the bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha whimpered at the loss, at the cold slide of silicone against her thigh.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio leaned down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That was a rhetorical question.” She squeezed Agatha’s wrist, then released. “Turn over for me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha did. She should have put up a fight, should have made Rio work for it, but her body was on the edge and if she didn’t come she was going to scream. She turned onto her elbows and knees and moaned as Rio’s hands gripped her hips, lifted her into the position she wanted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The silicone slid against her cunt, pressed between her folds, gathered her slick with every slow stroke.</i>
</p><p>
<i>One of Rio’s hands stayed at her hip while the other gripped Agatha at the base of her neck. The next stroke, Rio adjusted the tip to align and sunk in an inch, the wide head of it a delicious burn at Agatha’s entrance. She gripped the pillow, her mouth open silently against it as Rio withdrew and pressed in again, this time a little further.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fuck, Rio–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s word caught on the next thrust, this one sinking the cock nearly to the hilt, Rio’s legs grazing the back of her thighs.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She didn’t have the air or energy for any further words as Rio slid almost entirely out and drove her hips forward, fucking harshly back into her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The next minutes were filled with the slick slap of skin and Agatha’s cries smothered into the pillow, her body locked in an arch as Rio grunted into every hard, sharp thrust.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The hand on the back of Agatha’s neck squeezed and her body locked up, her mouth open in a pathetic, pitched inhale. She felt the onset of her orgasm, the violent rush of pleasure, the clench of her walls around the cock Rio was still fucking into her. It tore through her and suspended at its highest peak, her body trembling, before she went nearly boneless, her vision blurring. Rio caught her hips as they fell to keep from hurting her, her thrusts stilling. She gently slid out and let Agatha collapse and suck in lungfuls of air.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha blinked hazily as she listened to her heartbeat until it slowed. It took her a moment to become aware of Rio’s presence in the room again. She slowly rolled over and found Rio pushing the harness off her hips, her eyes dark on Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That was– Wow.” Agatha huffed out a laugh. “Wow.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s lips quirked up as she leaned down to pick up her jeans and something heavy and cold settled into the pit of Agatha’s stomach when those jeans were pulled over Rio’s boy shorts. She kept her voice light.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t want to keep things even?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio grinned, her fingers fastening the button closed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I like knowing you owe me one.” She tilted her head toward the door. “Besides, I gotta sleep so I can get my hangover over with.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her eyes, the disappointment stirring unpleasantly in her chest. At that moment, she wished she had followed Rio to her room. She hated not having the power to walk away on her terms. She tossed her arm over her eyes and used the other to wave Rio away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Makes sense. Get out so I can sleep.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio laughed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Goodnight, Harkness.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha swallowed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Goodnight, Vidal.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The sound of the door closing allowed Agatha to withdraw her arm. She stared at the ceiling and clenched her teeth. This wasn’t a mistake. She was more than capable of having meaningless sex. She preferred it. The new, achy feeling in her chest was from her concern that this would make things weird between her and the one person she could stand in her cohort.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha repeated the mantra until she believed it, until her heartbeat settled and she fell into an easy, drunken sleep.</i>
</p><p>Agatha pulled the car over onto the shoulder to multiple honks. She leaned her head back against the seat and heaved in a breath. Then two. Rio’s expression replayed in her mind, the hope in her eyes being crushed into dust again and again like Agatha was some kind of villain set on her demise. She breathed out harshly. <i>“I’ll make sure the team is aware of your assistance in this case.”</i></p><p>What the fuck was that? Fucking her <i>again,</i> ignoring Alder <i>again,</i> would have been better. Agatha pulled out her phone and opened Rio’s contact with her heart pounding heavy in her chest. It would be so, so easy. She stared at the blinking blue line, her fingers itching to type anything that would get Rio back in the same place with her.</p><p>Her insides coiled in anticipation. She started to type, stopped, and closed her eyes. Rio’s smile, her gentleness, her ceaseless dedication. She’d be there the second Agatha asked it of her. But it wouldn’t be fair. Rio didn’t deserve the false hope. She didn’t deserve to have Agatha hurting her, leading her on, toying with her emotions.</p><p>Agatha turned off her phone and headed toward the nearest bar. She needed a drink. Just one to take the edge off, to ease the ache. Just one to keep her from opening her phone and repeating their destructive cycle.</p><p>___________</p><p>Agatha blinked awake, her skull pounding ferociously, her mouth tasting like cigarettes and stale liquor. She groaned, twisted, and stilled. She didn’t recognize the warm tones of yellow and cream that surrounded her, the colorful furniture or the weird sunflower rug that took up half of the wooden floor. Dread sunk into her bones, regret beat harsh against her chest.</p><p>She slowly looked to her left and froze at the sight of bright blonde hair fanned out over the pillow beside her.</p>

<p>Agatha pressed her hand over her mouth and stared in shock at the ceiling. She felt violently ill, her head gummy and cloudy. She tried to remember a single thing from the night before and only succeeded in getting glimpses of tequila shots and lime and a bar that smelled like grease and stale beer. Everything else blurred together, streaks of color and sound that meant absolutely nothing to her. She glanced over at the blonde hair again, a full-body kind of panic filling her.</p><p>She kept herself totally still as she looked around for her phone. After forty seconds of failure, she decided she was fine leaving it behind. She could wipe it once she got to her computer.</p><p>Agatha very carefully lifted the sheets and began to slide out, her legs bare against the fabric. The cloying dread that had yet to leave her body doubled and she peered down to see she was wearing sunflower printed shorts and a loose, white t-shirt with Taylor Swift’s face splashed on it.</p><p>Agatha slid awkwardly from the bed, attempting to make as few movements as possible, and landed her bare feet on the fuzzy carpet. The sudden change in orientation forced her to throw all attempts at escape out the window, her body revolting at the gratuitous amount of alcohol she’d poured down her throat.</p><p>She sprinted toward the closest door and yanked it open, desperately hoping it was a bathroom. She flung herself to the porcelain bowl just in time to vomit, the acid of it tearing at her throat. She coughed, spit, and dry heaved as the nausea spun through her.</p><p>She pressed her forehead against the cold plastic seat of some stranger’s toilet and groaned. Her voice came out like a pathetic croak.</p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p>She barely had a minute reprieve before she repeated the entire, horrific process.</p><p>She vaguely heard a conversation happening outside the room but her own retching disrupted any chance of her overhearing it.</p><p>Agatha heaved again and felt the tepid cold flood across her skin even as she began to sweat.</p><p>She groaned again as she heard the door open behind her.</p><p>“Um, hi girlie. I’m so sorry you're sick. I called your friend to come pick you up.”</p><p>Agatha groaned even louder, her mind trying to place a name to the sound of the woman’s chipper voice. Had she fucked a straight woman?</p><p>It took a moment for Agatha to process the words she’d said. In the brief space between being violently ill, Agatha turned her head to look.</p><p>The woman was likely in her early thirties. She was the kind of hot that Agatha would be impressed by if she wasn’t throwing up in her toilet.</p><p>“My friend?”</p><p>The woman smiled, her teeth perfect.</p><p>“Of course, the one you talked about last night?”</p><p>Agatha felt a sneaking, crawling terror clamber up her spine.</p><p>“Last night?”</p><p>The woman walked further into the room and grabbed a clean washcloth. She began to run it under the water and squeezed out the excess liquid.</p><p>“Yeah, your friend, Rio?” She moved to place the towel on the back of Agatha’s neck. “She was in your Emergency Contact list. It’s fun you have her as a skull. I think it’s so cute to keep your friends under emojis. I’d love to do that but I’d forget who was who within a week.”</p><p>Agatha caught her wrist, her own eyes wide as the reality of her situation crashed through her.</p><p>“You called <i>Rio</i> to come here?”</p><p>The woman looked at her in confusion, her head tilting like a puppy.</p><p>“I mean, yeah? Last night was fun and all but I have to work in an hour.”</p><p>Agatha needed her to understand.</p><p>“You called Rio, my <i>ex-wife,</i> to come pick me up from a one-night-stand?”</p><p>The woman’s eyes blew wide, her mouth dropping open and closing a second layer. She grimaced.</p><p>“If it helps, we didn’t hook up? We made out—you’re a great kisser by the way—  and then you started crying.”</p><p>Agatha felt a rush of further embarrassment, something she didn’t think was possible in her current state, and turned to be sick again in the toilet. She felt the cold press of the washcloth against her neck and the woman drew her hair back from her face.</p><p>Agatha dry-heaved four times before the urge to throw up ceased. She groaned and fought the urge to collapse on the cold tile.</p><p>“Oh my god.” Agatha dragged her weak arm under her cheek to rest on. “Oh god.” She looked sideways at the woman. “I cried?”</p><p>The blonde nodded but she didn’t look upset.</p><p>“I get it. I’ve done it.” The woman sat down a couple feet from Agatha and gave her a warm smile like Agatha wasn’t the most vile thing she’d ever seen. “You apologized a lot and said you were going to Uber home. Then you walked into my room and climbed into my bed.”</p><p>Agatha was mortified. She considered killing the woman and running before Rio could arrive. She would never allow this information to leave this house.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” She had very few other words that felt adequate. She looked down at her borrowed sleepwear. “Did I steal your clothes too?”</p><p>The woman chuckled lightly.</p><p>“No but you got really hot and started taking off your sweater and slacks and stuff. I didn’t want you to freak out in the morning so I gave you something to wear.” She looked somewhat embarrassed. “Sorry I didn’t sleep on the couch, it’s super small and uncomfortable and I really needed to rest before my shift today.”</p><p>Agatha felt the feverish spinning begin to fade and hoped it had run its course for the day. At least until she could get home.</p><p>She closed the lid and flushed the toilet. Her mouth felt horrid and she tried not to let the taste on her tongue bring back her nausea.</p><p>The woman stood and opened the mirror. She pulled out a brand-new toothbrush and held it out with a shrug.</p><p>“I keep them just in case.” She moved toward the door. “I’ll let you clean up.”</p><p>Agatha heard the door click and her mind raced with thoughts on what Rio was thinking, how she was feeling, what she would say. If she would actually come. She didn’t know what time it was, but by the sun streaming in the apartment, she figured it had to be after ten.</p><p>Agatha thoroughly brushed her teeth and tongue, her stomach an empty pit of pain. She used the woman’s mouthwash and splashed water on her face. She pumped the woman’s facial cleanser to scrub off her smudged makeup.</p><p>With a steeling breath, Agatha walked out of the bathroom. She looked for her actual clothes but couldn’t find them. With every ounce of self-respect she could muster, Agatha stepped into the living room. She got flashes of conversation from the night before, both of them sat on the bright yellow couch.</p><p>She looked at the cluttered space, the discarded sets of scrubs around the room, the practical white and black shoes tucked under various pieces of furniture. She looked through the living room into the kitchen where the woman was making a cup of coffee in a styrofoam cup. She turned around and walked toward Agatha with a smile.</p><p>“Hey, I made it how I like it. Sorry, I should have asked.” She pressed the warm beverage into Agatha’s hands and bent down to pick up a white grocery bag. “Your clothes are in here. I think Jerry spilled a beer on you last night.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her.</p><p>“Jerry?”</p><p>The woman laughed.</p><p>“The owner of the Hex.” When Agatha didn’t show any form of understanding, the woman softened. “We got pretty fucked up last night. I don’t know how much you remember, but I’m Bea— short for Beatrice— and the Hex is the gay bar off of—“</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No— I know where the Hex is.” She took a sip of the coffee and forced her face to remain blank despite the tooth-achingly sweet tang. Agatha looked at the bag of her apparently beer-covered clothing and grimaced.</p><p>“Did I— can you tell me what I said? About Rio?”</p><p>Bea smiled with pity and Agatha wished she could drag the words back inside.</p><p>“If I’m so honest, I only remembered bits and pieces and her name. I actually thought you hated her at first? Then you told me a story about her, I think? Something about your first time camping together.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced and looked around for her phone.</p><p>“That is— well…” Agatha blew out a breath and refocused on Bea. “How are you not hungover?”</p><p>Bea looked pleased.</p><p>“I don’t really get those.”</p><p>A knock on the door saved Agatha from strangling the woman. Just in time to send her into a violent tailspin of terror.</p><p>“Fuck. Shit.” Agatha looked for her phone again. “Do you have a back door?”</p><p>The woman seemed to pick up on her search and moved over to the coffee table. She revealed Agatha’s phone and offered her an apologetic grimace.</p><p>“Sorry, just the one.”</p><p>Agatha felt like hell itself would appear if that door opened. She stared at it and considered puking all over again.</p><p>Bea cleared her throat awkwardly.</p><p>“I know this is totally my fault but I actually really need to get ready for work. Do you want me to tell her to go?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head and grabbed her sack of clothes. She stuffed her bare feet into her Oxfords and wished for the world to end.</p><p>Bea walked toward the door and swung it open.</p><p>“Hi, Rio! It’s nice to meet you. Wow, you are gorgeous.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up as she walked to the door. She didn’t look up as she slipped past both of them into the bitter cold, only noting Rio’s charcoal gray slacks and black shoes. She definitely didn’t look up as Bea called after her, “It was nice getting to know you, Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha moved quickly down the steps, the cold wind biting into her exposed skin, and made it to the pavement just as her nausea returned. She gripped the railing and folded over, her head spinning, the dirty snow and the bright sun overhead making her feel sick.</p><p>Rio’s shoes slowed beside her and Agatha sighed.</p><p>“I will just call an Uber. You don’t need to wait with me.”</p><p>She heard a car door open, feet on gravel, then;</p><p>“Get in the car, Agatha.”</p><p>The skin on Agatha’s neck prickled at Rio’s tone. Agatha finally looked up to take in her surroundings and couldn’t for the life of her pinpoint even the state they were in. She looked at Rio.</p><p>She didn’t have a coat, her blazer missing, and her black button-down shirt shifted in the stiff breeze. She was wearing sunglasses and her hair was down, soft around her face.</p><p>She’d clearly been at work.</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched painfully. She wanted to see Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Just get in the car.”</p><p>Agatha did.</p><p>She climbed into the Tahoe and Rio closed the door behind her with a sharp thud.</p><p>Agatha looked down at Taylor Swift’s face sitting prominently on her shirt and felt the dizziness return. She curled her legs into her chest and pressed her forehead against her knees to try and stabilize herself.</p><p>The driver door opened, Rio climbed inside, the door shut.</p><p>Agatha waited for the turn of the ignition, the blast of heat on her ice-cold skin. It didn’t come.</p><p>She lifted her head to find Rio’s hands tight on the wheel, her head aimed straight. The muscles in Rio’s forearms were flexed with the grip and Agatha’s heart broke.</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“Agatha, I don’t— I can’t hear it.” Her voice wavered, heated frustration lacing her tone. “It doesn’t matter. You’re allowed to do whatever you want.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her arms around her legs.</p><p>“I didn’t.” Rio didn’t say anything, didn’t cut her off, and Agatha felt her words clamber over themselves to ease whatever Rio was feeling in that moment. “I didn’t sleep with her. I was so fucking drunk and I think I wanted to but I couldn’t.”</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell, her jaw grinding.</p><p>“Why?” She paused. “Give me a straight answer, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha blew out a breath. She opened her mouth to reply just as a knock sounded on the window. Agatha knew who it was before she glanced over and she thought about sliding onto the floor mat at her feet.</p><p>Bea smiled awkwardly, the toll of the morning events getting to her.</p><p>Rio turned on the ignition and rolled down the window.</p><p>Bea waved.</p><p>“I got a text from Jerry. You left your wallet and keys with him. He said he’ll get to the bar in about an hour if you want to pick them up.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and gave her most pained smile.</p><p>“Thanks, I—I’ll swing by.”</p><p>Bea nodded. She started to turn, paused.</p><p>“I’ll text you?” Agatha balked and Bea’s eyes widened, shooting to Rio. “Oh god, for the clothes! I really like that shirt.”</p><p>The thud of her heartbeat in her chest was going to be the reason she puked again.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Bea smiled, waved again, and nearly bolted from the car.</p><p>Rio quickly rolled up the window and pulled away.</p><p>Agatha looked at her and Rio held up a hand.</p><p>“Don’t talk to me until I tell you to.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together and looked out the window.</p><p>They drove for twenty minutes in tense silence, Rio stewing in her seat, Agatha fluctuating from guilt to illness so rapidly she couldn’t even try to start a conversation.</p><p>She vaguely recognized that they were not going in the direction of the Maximoffs' house. In fact, after another fifteen minutes, Agatha realized they were heading in the opposite direction.</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“What did I say, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t have the energy to argue. She’d seen Rio like this only a handful of times. When she, despite all efforts, became oversaturated with emotion. When all of her coping and management skills failed her and she had to find a way to draw herself together manually. Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>___________</p><p>She woke to the sound of birds and the bright sun blazing into her skin. Agatha blinked, feeling mildly better even through her disorientation, and looked to find the driver’s seat empty.</p><p>The car was parked, sitting in a nearly-empty lot. Rio had placed her open go-bag on her seat, a pair of sweats and socks sitting on top. There was a hoodie slung over the shoulder of the driver’s seat and a new coffee in the cup holder, Bea’s sugary disaster tossed somewhere.</p><p>Agatha touched the rim of the lid, her heart in her throat. She pulled the clean sweats over the stupid sunflower shorts and reached for the hoodie. As she slipped it over her head, face passing through the neck of it, she let out a sob. Agatha pressed her hand over her mouth and forced her composure. She had no right.</p><p>The hoodie smelled so much like Rio. The sandalwood and bergamot seeped into Agatha’s chest and she forced herself to take the socks and stuff them onto her feet. She dug into the bag and pulled out Rio’s spare boots.</p><p>With a painful swallow, Agatha finally looked outside the car.</p><p>She recognized the location immediately; Terrapin Nature Park had been one of Rio’s favorite places to take Nicky; one of the only trails Agatha didn’t hate because it was pretty and flat and she adored Rio sharing it with their son.</p><p>Agatha turned off the ignition and pushed her door open weakly. She knew where she’d find Rio and she considered walking the full three-mile path to delay the conversation ahead. Instead, she withdrew her coffee and locked the car, her feet carrying her toward the beach.</p><p>She saw Rio, still no jacket despite the wind that cut through even Agatha’s sweatshirt, sitting with her back toward her. She was looking out over the water and Agatha let herself get pulled in.</p><p>She drew to a stop beside Rio and lowered herself into the sand.</p><p>Rio’s sunglasses sat on her head, her eyes looking out over the rolling waves. They were red, swollen, resigned.</p><p>Agatha wanted to reach out. She clenched her hands in the soft sand instead.</p><p>She waited.</p><p>Rio finally looked down minutes later, a sigh leaving her lips.</p><p>“Talk. You were going to tell me why you didn't sleep with her.”</p><p>Agatha chewed on her lip.</p><p>“I don’t remember a lot but…” Agatha dragged her fingers through the sand. “Apparently I started crying.”</p><p>Rio huffed, her voice lacking any humor.</p><p>“That’s one way to kill the mood. You said you couldn’t. Why did you say that if you don’t even remember?”</p><p>Agatha only had one answer and she knew it wasn’t fair.</p><p>“Because she wasn’t you.”</p><p>The statement stilled them both.</p><p>Rio rested her elbows on her knees, pressed her hands against her face. She sat like that for a time. Agatha lost count of the minutes.</p><p>Eventually, Rio pulled her hands down and hung them tiredly over her knees. Her cheeks were wet.</p><p>“You can’t just say that to me.”</p><p>Agatha watched broken bits of shell get buried under the sand with every movement of her fingers.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio’s voice was wrecked.</p><p>“You can’t just— fuck, Agatha. Fuck you.” She laughed an empty laugh. “This is my fault. I know I’m the one that brought you back here. I just thought— I wanted to help. I thought that I would be okay. I’d keep my distance, you’d find a shred of the person you used to be, you’d <i>live</i>.” Rio’s voice shook with frustration. “And I couldn’t. The moment I saw you I should have just turned around. I should have left you to rot in that shitty apartment and that shitty job because at least you wouldn’t have dragged me down with you." Rio’s tears fell harder and she wiped at them roughly. “I don’t know who I am anymore.</p><p>“All the progress I’ve made, all the work I put in to stop myself from waking up every day just dreading the prospect of being alive…” Rio drew in a sharp breath. “All for nothing? And you— you just take a hammer to everyone around you like we’re not real, like we exist to make <i>you</i> feel better.” Rio pushed herself to her feet suddenly, her voice raising. “I know you lost your son, Agatha, but you seem to forget so fucking easily that I did too. I lost Nicky and I lost you and I sat in our empty house for weeks waiting for you to make good on your promise, waiting for you to remember through all your grief that somebody else was there suffering beside you! Just as sad, just as alone, just as desperate for something to make the pain a little more bearable.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t wipe the tears falling down her cheeks in rivulets, painting her neck, soaking into her collar. She felt every word like a blow and she knew she deserved them.</p><p>Rio’s hands curled into fists.</p><p>“I know I should have said something when you came to say goodbye. But I was so hurt. I hated you nearly as much as I loved you when you showed up at our home just to tell me you were leaving for good. I called after you drove away.” Rio’s voice went hoarse. “I wrote to you for three years, Agatha. Three fucking years! It’s pathetic, I know. If none of my thousands of words could make you care… I should have stopped. But I suddenly had so much to say. Every day, there were things I wanted to tell you, and the fact that I couldn’t—“  Rio shook her head. “Every time I put one in the mailbox I thought: ‘this could be the one that does it. This could be the one with the right words that will bring her back.’” She let out a self-deprecating scoff and Agatha could hear that she was running out of steam. “I should have taken the hint.”</p><p>Agatha spoke so quietly she hoped Rio wouldn’t be able to hear.</p><p>“I didn’t read them.”</p><p>Rio stared at her. Her voice was deathly calm.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha’s words shook.</p><p>“Your letters. I didn’t read them.”</p><p>“You didn’t read them.”</p><p>Rio sounded like ice and Agatha clenched her teeth together, her fingers stilling under the sand.</p><p>“It hurt too much. I just wanted the pain to go away and they made it worse.”</p><p>Rio was silent. She stared at Agatha and Agatha didn’t look back, kept her eyes on the sand.</p><p>Eventually, Rio spoke and it felt like the voice of a ghost.</p><p>“I’ll drop you off at your car.”</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>Rio walked past and Agatha, back toward the car, and Agatha cried. Hard. She let the violent sadness tear through her until she bled dry.</p><p>Agatha curled over her stomach and threw up the two sips of coffee she’d taken. She spit in the sand and then pushed herself to her feet.</p><p>The walk back to the car felt like an eternity and like a single moment. When it came into view, she saw Rio already in the driver’s seat, her sunglasses dropped onto her nose.</p><p>Agatha stopped, stared.</p><p>Rio was done. She could see it in every line of her.</p><p>This was good. She repeated it even though it felt like she’d never be able to breathe again. Rio deserved to move on, to find somebody better than Agatha.</p><p>Rio’s words had imprinted themselves under her skin; they marked her as cruel, as selfish, as a coward. All true, all unforgivable. Rio had said she was better before Agatha came back, that she’d found a way to live with a little less pain. Agatha had taken that away.</p><p>She’d had Wanda. Agatha had taken that too.</p><p>She’d had her work...</p><p>Agatha shook her head. She walked to the car and climbed inside.</p><p>She didn’t talk for the hour and a half trip back to Potomac. Rio didn’t say a word.</p><p>It was so jarringly different to the drive that had started all of this. That had felt like a continuation of their story. Painful, terrible, frightening. But still, a continuation.</p><p>Despite all of it, despite her rage and grief, she’d never expected there to be an ending.<br/>
___________</p><p>Rio dropped her at the front of the bar and waited silently for Agatha to step outside.</p><p>She drove off as soon as the door closed.</p><p>Agatha had collected her keys and wallet and driven home in a haze. Her stomach still hurt but the rest of her hurt far worse.</p><p>She walked up the drive feeling like this might be her most tragic walk of shame in history. She was wearing two women’s clothing and neither one had fucked her.</p><p>She’d barely reached the edge of the main manor when Wanda stepped outside.</p><p>She looked pissed, her arms crossed, her face drawn tight.</p><p>Agatha slowed, swallowed.</p><p>“Rio called you.”</p><p>Wanda walked down her front steps and Agatha was positive she was about to get clocked. Instead, Wanda reached out and pulled her into a harsh hug.</p><p>“You’re so fucking stupid.”</p><p>Agatha collapsed in Wanda’s arms, her own latching around Wanda’s shoulders. They stood there for a time, Agatha crying, Wanda holding her, then Agatha stepped back.</p><p>They made their way through the garden to the guest house. Instead of going inside, Agatha sat heavily on the swing. Wanda sat beside her.</p><p>“I have to go soon.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>“I know. She needs you.”</p><p>Wanda sighed.</p><p>“Agatha, what happened?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, her head dropping back.</p><p>“Rio came into the office last night.”</p><p>“That was my fault. I saw you were gone and I asked her if you were there. I was worried.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“You haven’t done anything wrong.” she looked at the icy garden, tucked her nose into the collar of Rio’s sweatshirt. “I just can’t be good with her. To her.” Agatha drew in a slow breath to keep herself calm. “Wanda, she is so good. And I fucked it up. I’m trying to listen to my therapist but it feels impossible. This weight, this pain. I kept taking it out on her, and when I tried not to, I ended up blacked-out at the Hex. I went home with somebody.”</p><p>Wanda’s voice held that edge of anger again.</p><p>“She called me this morning. Said that some woman had told her you were throwing up in her bathroom.” Wanda hesitated. “She sounded bad, Agatha. I hadn’t heard her like that since after Nicky– since you left.”</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek hard enough that she bled.</p><p>“I didn’t– nothing really happened. But for her to get that call…” Agatha pressed her tongue into the wound. “She took me to Terrapin. Said all the things she’s been keeping to herself for god knows how long.” Agatha pressed a hand to her mouth, her voice shaking again. “Wanda, do you know– did she tell you about the letters?”</p><p>Wanda looked at her then, her head tilted in confusion.</p><p>“Letters?”</p><p>Agatha stood.</p><p>“I know you need to go but," Agatha sighed. "can you come with me for a moment?”</p><p>Wanda stood beside her.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Agatha felt the five years of stalling, of avoidance, coalesce around her as she climbed the stairs to her room with Wanda on her heels. She walked to her closet and pulled out the box and the leatherbound book.</p><p>They felt like stones as she dumped the letters onto the ground, like they’d be lifted and pelted against her skin for the sin of letting Rio’s words go to waste. She heard Wanda suck in a breath and tensed. With shaking fingers, she peeled open the book to the first page of flowers carefully stored on the page.</p><p>Wanda stared.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha ground out a quiet acknowledgement,</p><p>“I know.” She picked up the shredded letter and stared at the visible scratching of Rio’s words. “I tried once and I just– I didn’t want to face them. I wasn’t ready. I didn’t even consider what they did to her. I told her today that I’d never even opened them.”</p><p>Wanda knelt beside her, slid her hand through all 37 letters. She drew in a calming breath.</p><p>“Agatha, I have to go.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, eyes glazing over, voice quiet.</p><p>“I know. I just wanted somebody to be here when I started.”</p><p>Wanda’s arms wrapped around her again, her lips pressing against Agatha’s temple.</p><p>“I’ll be back tonight if I can.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, thumb running over the plastic bag.</p><p>“It’s okay if you’re not. She won’t tell you if she wants you to stay but–.”</p><p>Wanda pulled back, squeezed her arm.</p><p>“I know. Call Vision if you need anything. I know Billy would be happy to see you too.”</p><p>She heard Wanda’s quickly-retreating footsteps down the stairs, the sound of the door opening and closing. She vaguely heard the start of an engine as she pieced together the first letter.<br/>

<i>My Heart,</i>
</p><p>
<i>I will spend every moment apart with the regret that I did not stop you from walking away. I know; we were not understanding each other in the end. I thought maybe you would better hear my words if they were written on paper. I know how dark your world is right now. Seeing you was like holding a mirror to my grief, like prying open my chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I think we’ve failed one another so thoroughly. The last weeks with our beautiful boy were spent knowing he was going to disappear. That kind of pain is impossible to hold, impossible to keep inside, impossible to endure. We turned it on one another like blades.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I’m sitting here, that abhorrent pain barely dulled, wondering why I let the only light left in my life disappear too. We created our son together, love. We raised him together, we loved him together. We are not prepared to undergo the devastation of losing him apart.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Yours,</i>
</p><p><i>Rio</i><br/>

<i>Sweetheart,</i>
</p><p>
<i>There’s so much I want to say to you as the year’s end approaches. Sometimes I feel as if I’m marching a slow path to my own grave, that I’ve had a shovel in my hands, that a box waits for me at the end. Sometimes it feels okay to know that I’d be joining our boy.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The weight of Nicky’s loss is particularly heavy as the anniversary approaches. I wake up in the middle of the night and I walk to his room because I think I’ve heard him crying for me. For you. Do you remember when he was two and he screamed for us every night for two weeks? We slept so poorly. I woke up once to find you asleep on the floor by his bed; he’d put his bunny beside you to keep you safe.</i>
</p><p>
<i>We eventually decided to take turns sleeping in his room because neither of us could stand to hear him so upset. Wanda was so adamant that we were enabling him, that every book to exist said we had to leave him alone for him to learn. I think it was a mercy, a gift. We knew, somehow, that we had to take every moment we could.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha, I miss him so much. I’m so afraid to face the next months alone. I miss you. I don’t know if that’s fair of me to say. I’m sorry if it’s not. You haven’t answered my last five letters. Maybe you’re not ready but I don’t know how to do this without you. If you could just call me, I think that would be enough.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Yours,</i>
</p><p><i>Rio</i><br/>
________</p><p>
<i>January 28, 2020</i>
</p><p>
<i>I don’t have many words to give, but I didn’t want to leave you alone to face this. I’m not doing very well, love. I imagine that is true for you too. Wanda is spending the week with me and I’ve taken some time off of work. I hope you’re taking care of yourself, that you have someone to carry the burden of this pain if it is not me. I’ll be thinking of you.</i>

<i>Darling,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nothing smells the same anymore. The house has changed; like it’s forgotten that there was more than just me once. It feels too big, but I can’t let it go. What’s left of our life is still sitting here on the shelves and in the cabinets waiting for you to come back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was Nicky’s birthday last week. I know you know that. I sat in his silly ‘treehouse’ for hours. For a kid, he sure knew how to stack sticks together against a tree in a way that would last. Not a single one has fallen out of place. Maybe he would have become an engineer. Or an architect. Who am I kidding, he would have worked in a Zoo.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I hope you can write to me; let me know you’re okay. You don’t have to say anything else if you don’t want to. If you can’t.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Yours,</i>
</p><p><i>Rio</i><br/>

<i>Agatha,</i>
</p><p>
<i>I know you’re working as a detective now. Is it as interesting as the FBI? I’ve always been curious. You have your work cut out for you. I may have looked into your precinct and it doesn’t score all that well in the general analysis.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I started taking classes again. At Georgetown. I’m in an Intro to Ancient Rome course and one called Egyptomania. I’m having to relearn how to study. Remember how Nicky would run my flashcards between us? I feel like I never forgot a single thing I learned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I know Wanda has reached out to you too. I guess you’re not ready to talk to either of us. She just had twins. They’re so beautiful, Agatha. I was scared it would hurt to meet them but they are perfect. I’m sure you’ll see that one day.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda said you pushed your sabbatical out. I’ll still be here, you know? When you come back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Yours,</i>
</p><p><i>Rio</i><br/>

<i>Agatha,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Is it wrong for me to continue hoping that you’ll answer? Every letter I send seems like it should be my last. It seems like I’m missing the last page of a book, like everyone around me knows how it is supposed to end but I am here hoping for it to be written.</i>
</p><p>
<i>This year was no easier than the last. I expected it to be like a calloused hand, dulled by the work I’ve put in, but it was as if it had only just happened. Wanda might be the only thing keeping me afloat. And my therapist. I never told you, did I? I went back. I thought it might help me (Wanda thought it might).</i>
</p><p>
<i>She misses you too. I spent the last month living in her guesthouse. I needed the world to feel a little bit smaller. I’m home now.</i>

<i>Agatha,</i>
</p><p>
<i>I was promoted to Senior Agent. Wanda too. We worked on a case– well, maybe one day I can tell you. Your sabbatical is ending in a few months. Have you decided what you’ll do when you return? A lot of our cohort has moved into other roles, other field offices. Bohner is in Cincinnati now. I don’t think anyone goes to those trivia nights anymore. Or plays in the volleyball league. It's strange to see an era come to an end; even if it feels like ours already did. </i>

</p><p>
<i>To My Heart,</i>
</p><p>
<i>I went into Nicky’s room for the first time in a year. I missed him so dearly I couldn’t breathe. I wanted something that he had once touched and you were not here.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I think I sat on his bed for hours holding that silly, stuffed rabbit he adored. I miss him so much, Agatha. Sometimes I think I may simply die from the pain of it. Sometimes I think I already have. That I am living an empty life; like I am a puppet being strung through each day with the hope that one day I might cut myself free.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I miss you. I wish I could be there to hold you through the worst of these feelings.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But, Agatha, I’m beginning to believe that you aren’t going to come back. If I’m honest with myself, I’ve expected for some time that you have moved on from our life, from our memories. You can tell me, you know? I just want your happiness. If that isn’t with me, if it means you have to leave us behind, I want that for you.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Yours Anyway,</i>
</p><p><i>Rio</i><br/>
_______</p><p>By the time Agatha finished the last letter, she had smudged the ink on every single page, the paper damp under her fingers. She had been split open. Consumed. She hated herself, hated the person she had become. Hated that Rio had been reaching for her for three years and she’d been too much of a coward to even bear witness to her grief.</p><p>Agatha stood, wrecked, and made her way to the small desk in her room. She found a partially used notebook and began to write.</p><p>
<i>December 27, 2024</i>
</p><p>
<i>My Beloved Rio,</i>
</p><p>
<i>I know I am five years too late.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I don’t expect to be forgiven, I don’t expect you to forget the time you suffered waiting for a reply that never came.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Allow me, if you will, to give you the words you deserved to hear in your darkest moments.</i>
</p><p>
<i>You, Rio, were always the brightest, most beautiful part of my life, and I forgot that somewhere in the horror of losing our sweet boy. I had so many dreams and hopes for a future that never came to pass. I let the ones that still could shrivel and fade away even as you held out a hand toward me. I did not deserve your perseverance. You did not deserve my silence.</i>
</p><p>
<i>There wasn’t a day that passed where I didn’t think of you. You were there in every moment even when I didn’t want you to be. I accepted, when I left, that my life was over, that I simply needed to live until I had the fortune of dying. I didn’t know what to do with the way I was grieving not only our son, but the loss of you.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I want you to know that I would have come back. If I had read your letters, if I had been brave enough to face my own grief, nothing could have kept me away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I cannot begin to undo the damage I have caused, but I can offer you what was always yours.</i>
</p><p>
<i>You have been, and always will be, my heart.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Yours,</i>
</p><p><i>Agatha</i><br/>
________</p><p>Agatha didn’t think beyond her next moments, her hands folding the paper, her feet carrying her to the leather-bound book. She turned to the last page and let out a pained gasp as the single photo she kept, the only one not left in the home they had shared, stared brightly back at her.</p><p>Nicky was nearly two. It was the first time they’d taken him to see the lighting of the Christmas tree. Wanda and Vision had come with them, had taken the photo right as the lights flashed on. She remembered it so clearly, the delirious joy she’d felt standing with Nicky on Rio’s shoulders, held high enough to see the glow.</p><p>She’d been able to do nothing but kiss Rio then.</p><p>She tucked the photograph between the folded letter.</p><p>The memory ached fiercely but a wet smile lifted her lips.</p>

<p>“I want you to take a moment and separate what is true versus what is not.”</p><p>Agatha sulked. She was sitting across from Alder in jeans and the hoodie she had tossed on after forcing herself to prepare for the day. It was soft and thick and it still smelled like Rio.</p><p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>Alder raised a brow, unamused.</p><p>“Tell me about what is true from your conversation with Rio. And tell me what is not.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t get comfortable. No matter her efforts to slouch, to cross her arms, to pick at the loose threads of the couch, she had yet to stop moving. To give herself a chance to think, delay, stall, Agatha leaned down and picked out a fidget. It was shaped like a snake with pieces that could connect and spin. She started to pull the pieces apart.</p><p>“It’s all true.”</p><p>Alder shook her head.</p><p>“Agatha, what is true is that you have made mistakes. That is human, that is expected.” Alder held her gaze, eyes sharp. “There were many inferences made that are not true.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t bring herself to speak, couldn’t bring herself to deny a single one of Rio’s words. She wasn’t being obstinate, she, for once, didn’t want to lie.</p><p>“I’m not ready to talk about it.”</p><p>“Vetoed.”</p><p>Agatha gaped, her eyes wide on the severe woman.</p><p>“You aren’t allowed to do that!”</p><p>Alder offered her a quiet smile.</p><p>“I’m here to do what is best, to guide you in your efforts to heal. This is the first time you’ve used that phrase in a way that is harmful to that healing.”</p><p>Agatha was all cried out. She hadn’t stopped the night before even after she’d placed her letter on her bedside table and curled under the quilt. She’d been up until the sun began to rise, her mind dragged her through the what ifs and the reality of Rio’s enduring suffering.</p><p>Now, she felt like she was in two places at once. Her body situated in uncomfortable fashion on Alder’s couch, her mind sitting somewhere five years in the past with the hope of making better choices.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long she sat without speaking, but soon Alder was standing in front of her.</p><p>“Agatha?” She tilted her head toward the door. “Why don’t we take a walk.”</p><p>Agatha blinked into her body again, her chest suddenly much tighter.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>She stood and trailed after Alder toward the door. They walked through the old house that had been transformed into an office; it kept all of the aged charm, the intricate woodwork of the carved molding and wainscoting, the massively tall windows, the stained glass in the front and back doors, the asymmetrical layout. Even the long driveway that led up to the home spoke of old money and very well paid landscapers.</p><p>Alder led Agatha through the back and into the massive gardens with an honest-to-god, massive fountain taking up the center. Hedges and cobbled paths swung out in a circular pattern that would probably be assumed alien if carved into a corn field.</p><p>It was impressive, grand, and Agatha felt nothing but a strange sense that Rio wouldn’t like it. There weren’t enough plants, and there weren't enough trees.</p><p>Alder drew to a stop at a bench beside the fountain and sat down. She patted the seat beside her.</p><p>“I need you to take a few deep breaths with me, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha did.</p><p>Alder, for the first time since Agatha had been meeting with her, relaxed. She let her shoulders fall, let her back slide the barest inch down the wooden slats.</p><p>“In this instance, I will ask you what is true and what is not.” She stared at the spray of water in front of them. “You and Rio lost your son.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. Alder hadn’t broached the topic of Nicky since she’d returned, not so directly.</p><p>“True.”</p><p>“It was someone’s fault.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to scream.</p><p>“I wish I had someone to blame.” She rubbed her cheek idly, tiredly. “Not true.”</p><p>Alder nodded.</p><p>“You were not a good partner.”</p><p>“True.”</p><p>Her answer came fast, sharp, and she clenched her jaw.</p><p>Alder hummed.</p><p>“We’ll put a pin in that. Rio was not a good partner.”</p><p>Agatha bristled. She was not a fan of this game.</p><p>“Not true.”</p><p>Alder’s eyes fell to her.</p><p>“This seems like an answer born from self-loathing. It dismisses context and time and paints a narrative that I do not imagine is accurate. You are telling me that you did not love Rio to the best of your abilities?”</p><p>“Not at the end.”</p><p>Alder let out a soft sigh.</p><p>“That’s where it’s tricky, isn’t it? Grief is powerful, it’s disarming, self-centering. One who is subject to it cannot often see beyond minutes; so frequently they live in moments and memories, they do not have clarity. Grief does not absolve us from our mistakes, but it provides explanation, it requests mercy from the people around us.”</p><p>Agatha nearly growled out her response.</p><p>“You’re talking in circles. Is there a reason for this?”</p><p>Alder didn’t allow their exercise to veer off course.</p><p>“You wanted to hurt Rio.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent. She considered her actions since she had returned.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Can you tell me more?”</p><p>Agatha tucked her nose into the collar of the sweatshirt absently, the motion repeated so many times in the last twenty four hours that it didn’t register to her.</p><p>“I hurt her. It doesn’t matter what my intention was.”</p><p>“That’s not true. Answer me; did you want to hurt Rio?”</p><p>Agatha sighed sharply.</p><p>“No! No, it just ended up being easier than the alternative.”</p><p>Alder nodded.</p><p>“Which was?”</p><p>“Facing her.” Agatha lowered her voice. “Wanting her.”</p><p>Alder was quiet for several seconds.</p><p>“Rio hurt you.”</p><p>She’d changed the language, an adjustment Agatha hadn’t prepared for. Of course Rio had never meant to cause her pain. But she thought back to the months before Nicky’s death, the slow way Rio had vanished from her too. She’d go to sleep alone, she’d wake up and find Rio sleeping on the couch or shoveling the fucking driveway at five in the morning.</p><p>
<i>Agatha shuffled her way through the dreadfully silent house, her face aching from the third night in a row of falling asleep despite the tears on her face. The tenth night of falling asleep with Rio nowhere to be found. It was still dark, the sun had not yet risen, and she walked silently past Nicky’s room and down the steps.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d woken to the sound of plastic scraping against the pavement, the grind of it startling her from a nightmare she hadn’t wanted to endure anyway. She walked to the front door and peered out to see Rio in jeans and a thin sweater, not nearly enough protection from the bitter chill, scooping and throwing snow from the porch into the yard. The entire driveway was already cleared and she could see strands of Rio’s dark, messy pony had frozen where it hung by her temples.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s chest clenched and she tugged Rio’s coat from the hook by the door and turned the knob. Rio looked up, met her eyes through the glass of the storm door, and Agatha froze at the emptiness that seemed permanent in her sunken eyes, the way Rio looked through her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d stepped outside anyway.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, it’s freezing.” Her voice was sharper than she meant it to be, a preparation for what she knew was coming. “Just put on your coat.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio continued throwing snow, her head falling low as she persisted in her task.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m fine.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt the surge of frustration from the continually building pool in her body. She clenched her jaw, released, and lost the energy to be upset as exhaustion folded her shoulders.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, love–” Her voice broke and she saw Rio slow, her movements unfocused. “Please just wear the coat.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She thought for a moment that maybe this might be the time that Rio diverted. Agatha felt as if she’d been watching her wife become animatronic, a repeating figure on a Christmas display.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Instead, Rio steeled her shoulders like Agatha was on the attack, like she had to defend herself.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She didn’t even offer a dismissal as she continued her task.</i>
</p><p>Agatha heaved a breath.</p><p>“True.”</p><p>“You left because Rio hurt you.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a sharp inhale.</p><p>“No.” The answer came out before she’d even processed the words. “Not true. I just– I had to go. I don’t think…” Agatha frowned into the collar of the sweatshirt. “We were so cruel to one another in the end. It wasn’t her or me, it was us. We weren’t good for one another.”</p><p>“You grieved while you were away.”</p><p>“True.”</p><p>Alder glanced at her, brows raised.</p><p>“How true?”</p><p>Agatha slid her feet against the dirt-covered path in front of the bench.</p><p>“I don’t know what else to call what I– the pain I felt.”</p><p>“Grief is fine, but consider that grief is a process by which we deal with, and heal from, the loss of something. When you returned here, when you spoke, you did so as if the wounds from Nicky’s loss had happened just yesterday.”</p><p>Agatha felt defensive, a lance up her spine that begged to circle her, protect her.</p><p>“That’s what it felt like.”</p><p>Something flashed in Alder’s eyes.</p><p>“And now?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened to respond, then closed. She frowned. A sudden, strange realization passed over her as she poked at the achey, vicious pain that had thrived inside her for years. It hurt but it felt… softer.</p><p>“I–” Agatha felt a pressing guilt. “But–” She swallowed. “It doesn’t seem right to– I can’t move on from him like he wasn’t the most important thing in my life! How am I supposed to do that?”</p><p>Something passed through Alder’s expression like the question was deeply familiar.</p><p>“You’re not moving on, Agatha. You’re not forgetting. You will take every step with Nicky walking alongside you. You will make every choice with his life having colored the person that you are. Consider this: If he were here, if he could see you, do you think he’d want you to finish what remains of your life looking behind you?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer for a long time. She knew the answer. She sat with it, embraced it with a finality that frightened her. She studied the cold stone of the dormant fountain and picked out the images of women’s faces carved deeply and eroded over years.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Alder nodded.</p><p>“Then it’s time to start looking forward.”</p><p>_________</p><p>Agatha had told Alder about the letter she wrote in response. She’d told her what she intended to do over the next weeks, months, however long.</p><p>
<i>”I won’t discourage your effort to make amends, but you shouldn’t do this with expectation.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha had crossed her arms tighter over her chest.</p><p>
<i>”I’m not expecting anything. I just want– If nothing else, she deserves to know the truth. To find closure if that’s what she’s looking for.”</i>
</p><p>Alder had nodded.</p><p>
<i>”And if she asks you to stop?</i>
</p><p>The question, asked softly, knocked the wind from Agatha’s lungs.</p><p><i>”Then I’ll stop.”</i><br/>
_________</p><p>By the time Agatha returned to the Maximoffs’, she felt as if she’d been scooped out, picked apart, and rebuilt. The new structure felt fragile, like the smallest gust of wind might topple her. She’d decided she could forge on until the moment that happened.</p><p>She gathered her gifts, the book picked up on her return home, and carried them over to the main house with her heart hammering in her chest.</p><p>She knocked and soon Vision’s face appeared, his smile wide.</p><p>“Agatha! Hello, please come in. I’ve just finished a coffee cake and I do believe it’s my best yet.”</p><p>Agatha looked at the threshold, hesitated, and stepped over.</p><p>She walked into warmth, the bitter breeze from outside automatically falling off as the smell of cinnamon and coffee and the sounds of Tommy and Billy playing from another room overtook her senses.</p><p>Vision didn’t mention the return of the bag he’d brought, clearly full. He didn’t look at her with pity or disappointment.</p><p>He led her into the kitchen like it was eight years prior. Like they were friends.</p><p>“I’ve tried something new on this one.”</p><p>He went on to describe the methods of getting the crisp crunch not only on the top but in pockets throughout. The method was surprisingly mathematical and Agatha didn’t attempt to follow along.</p><p>He’d just started to cut her a piece when she interrupted.</p><p>“Vision.”</p><p>He looked over at her, brows lifted.</p><p>She smiled and she wondered how long it would take for the expression to feel less forced.</p><p>“I wanted– I needed to thank you. For letting me stay. For caring for me.” She huffed. “For that absurd chess set that you spent too much money on.”</p><p>Vision’s expression softened, his hands stilling.</p><p>“Of course, Agatha. What else might we do? You are a dear friend and having you back in our lives has been a gift.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, her elbows settling on the counter as Vision finished plating the cake and set it in front of her.</p><p>“A gift. Right.”</p><p>Vision smiled.</p><p>“You may question it all you’d like, but Wanda has been happier. Billy is enamored with you and your rabbit. Whatever hasn’t been perfect can be overcome by actions such as what you are doing now.” He glanced toward the door then, his eyes softening further. His voice was lower, meant just for her. “You have a curious arrival.”</p><p>Agatha looked to the entryway and saw Billy’s little hands holding onto the trim, his head poking around the corner. He looked hesitant, worried, and Agatha’s heart broke for a moment all over again. She smiled, and, for the first time in over five years, she reached for somebody.</p><p>She held out her hand, a soft smile on her face, and Billy eased around the corner and walked into the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha turned on her barstool and slipped off, her knees cracking slightly as she squatted down to be at eye level.</p><p>“Hello Billy.”</p><p>He stopped a few steps away, rocking on his feet.</p><p>“Hi Agatha.” He took a step closer, voice quiet. “You didn’t come for Christmas.”</p><p>Agatha held out her hand, relaxed a little when Billy’s settled into hers.</p><p>“I know, I needed to take some Agatha time. I was very sad to miss your favorite book.”</p><p>Billy’s pouting seemed to slip off slightly, his shoulders lifting.</p><p>“Is that like mom time? And dad time?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, nodding.</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>Billy’s hand tightened around the side of her palm, his lips pulling into a smile.</p><p>“Did you also drink juice and sit in the garage?”</p><p>Agatha snorted, her eyes flicking to a semi-bashful Vision. He focused deeply on wrapping plastic around his coffee cake.</p><p>“Not quite. Very similar though.”</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>Billy’s attention had rapidly switched, his eyes lighting up on the wrapped gifts sitting in the bag at Agatha’s feet.</p><p>She leaned down and pulled out the carefully wrapped book.</p><p>“I got you and your brother gifts. I may have missed Christmas, but I wouldn’t miss giving you something to annoy your parents with.”</p><p>Billy giggled, his eyes bright and wide.</p><p>“Can I open them?”</p><p>Agatha pulled the book from the top.</p><p>“You can open this one and then you’ll have to get your brother.”</p><p>Billy ripped into the paper and stared at the silly, old cover with a rather bemused expression for a four year old.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“It’s my favorite book.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes lifted.</p><p>“What is it called?”</p><p>Agatha pulled the book toward her, the nostalgia coursing like a soft rain through her.</p><p>“King Bidgood’s in the Bathtub.”</p><p>Billy laughed.</p><p>“That’s silly. What’s it about?”</p><p>Agatha turned the book toward him.</p><p>“You’ll have to read it later to find out.” She set it on the counter. “Go get your brother and you can open the others.”</p><p>Billy squealed and bolted, his short memory easily filled with joy rather than his gutting disappointment, and Agatha took a relieved breath.</p><p>She took a bite of the coffee cake and refrained, barely, from letting her delight be known. She noted Vision’s side-eye as he watched and she shrugged.</p><p>“I’m still alive.”</p><p>Vision smiled brightly, a playful look in his eyes.</p><p>“You’re already going for a second bite.”</p><p>Agatha scowled.</p><p>“I haven’t eaten today. Don’t get a big head.”</p><p>She leaned down and withdrew Wanda and Visions’ gifts, setting them on the marble countertop. Beside them, she set the collection of children’s ice packs she’d stolen weeks ago.</p><p>Vision huffed.</p><p>“Ah, often one does not re-gift items that already belong to the recipient.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, stuffing another bite of the fucking unbelievable coffee cake into her mouth.</p><p>“It’s not a gift, it’s a return. They weren’t keeping my leftovers cold enough.”</p><p>Vision grinned and took the handful to place it in the freezer.</p><p>“My sincerest apologies that our stolen ice packs did not meet your standards.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and heard the sound of pattering footsteps. She finished her piece of the cake and turned toward the two boys as they careened into the room, their eyes locking onto the other gifts.</p><p>Vision caught their attention.</p><p>“Boys, what do you say!”</p><p>Their voices rang out in unison as they surrounded the packages.</p><p>“Thank you, Agatha!”</p><p>__________</p><p>They’d torn into the packages, their eyes wide at the game, ready to play, until they peeled open the Magna-Tiles. The exclamation from both boys had Agatha and Vision grimacing in-synch.</p><p>Agatha had expected for them to run off, but both had looked up at her with imploring faces, their eyes innocent and impossible to deny.</p><p>That was how she found herself, forty-five minutes later, in competition with two small children. The rules were simple on the surface: each person had the exact same amount of tiles to build a structure that would hold the most cans from the pantry.</p><p>But Agatha found that, as little kids are wont to do, other rules came to be.</p><p>“Agatha, you have to use all of your tiles!”</p><p>Agatha looked at the two tiles she didn’t use with a raised brow and then stuck them randomly onto her structure.</p><p>Tommy slapped his hands to his cheeks like <i>she</i> was exasperating <i>him</i>.</p><p>“That isn’t fair!”</p><p>Agatha bit back her laughter, her heart warm with the shrill whines of two little boys trying to get their way. It was a gut-punch, or should’ve been, but instead of dragging her to the depths of her memories, to the face of her son, she found a bittersweet joy.</p><p>“What do you mean? I used them all.”</p><p>Billy, his structure god-awful and bound to break under a single can, pointed like his was a prime example.</p><p>“You have to do it like this.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. She understood what they were saying even though neither could explain it. She quickly pulled a few pieces off to ensure the leftovers were made integral to her structure and she held out her hands.</p><p>“There. I think it’s time to stack.”</p><p>Billy popped up, Tommy at his heels, and they disappeared into the kitchen screaming for their dad to open the pantry.</p><p>Agatha heard the front door open and close and her heart froze in her chest. For the briefest moment, she feared Wanda had returned with Rio, that Agatha would make yet another blunder by being present where she didn’t belong.</p><p>And then Wanda stepped into the large living room, face drawn in exhaustion. She took in Agatha sitting alone on the floor, surrounded by silly, colorful structures, and she smiled.</p><p>“Agatha. How are you?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to force Wanda to carry anyone else’s emotional weight for at least the night. She motioned to the structures.</p><p>“Good, as I’m about to crush your kids’ hopes and dreams of victory.”</p><p>Wanda laughed as she dropped a small go-bag on the couch.</p><p>“I never expected you to go easy on them.” She tilted her head. “I’m going to say hi to Vision. Are you good here for a bit?”</p><p>Agatha waved her on, her mind immediately drifting to Rio and the fact that she was likely alone in their old house. She sat in the oncoming ache, her mind drifting to the letter she’d stuffed into an envelope and left in her passenger seat.</p><p>She had to wait until Monday to drop it off and the thought of it sent prickling fear along her skin.</p><p>Billy and Tommy tumbled back into the room, their hands filled with canned veggies, and they ran over to her with absurd severity.</p><p>Billy held out the first can.</p><p>“You can go first.”</p><p>Agatha won; much to the shock and devastation of two four-year-olds. Tommy had pouted, arms crossed, and Billy had found it so funny he’d rolled over his own tiles.</p><p>There was a mess of toys across the living room, something Agatha strangely missed despite the many arguments it had caused between her and Rio. It was always the other person’s turn, always a question of when was the right time to make Nicky do his own clean-up. Agatha smiled.</p><p>
<i>She’d just finished putting away the ridiculous collection of rubber dinosaurs when Rio thundered down the steps in shorts and a cropped t-shirt. She had a plastic sword in her right hand and a tiny shield strapped against her wrist so tightly that it was likely cutting off her circulation.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio whirled toward the giggling as Nicky made his way, very slowly, down the stairs. He ran into the room with an extendable lightsaber swinging around wildly and nearly cracked it over his own head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shuffled forward, lunged back, and let Nicky’s next strike break through her guard. She cried out dramatically, stumbled, and fell back into Agatha, nearly taking her to the floor.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, the Great Magnificent Strong and Dastardly Nicholas has beaten me!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was not in a good mood. The press of the plastic shield into her ribcage did not help. She clenched her jaw as Rio shifted to look up at her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was almost instant, the way her teasing softened, the slight pout of her lips as she dropped her sword and looked around the still incredibly messy room. She, finally, removed the shield and set it down on the ground as she scooted back enough to look at Agatha, then to Nicky.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Can you come here, Nicky?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He shook his head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sighed, hand circling around Agatha’s ankle and rubbing gently. She feigned a bow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh Great Magnificent Strong and Dastardly Nicholas, will you please come here?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky giggled again and dropped his lightsaber to shuffle toward them. Rio rubbed at a green mark on his cheek and quickly gave up after she realized it was marker. She whispered conspiratorially.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Perfect Angel Princess Mama needs help.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha groaned at the title and the hand on her ankle squeezed playfully.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky’s face went serious, his eyes shifting to Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Mama? Help how?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio leaned in and whispered to him. His answering laugh did not fill Agatha with any kind of peace.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky ran in front of her and grabbed her arm.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Come on, Princess Mama!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mood lightened despite her efforts to remain annoyed and she stood, letting herself be led toward the couch. Nicky pressed at her slacks, urging her to sit down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You have to stay here and not move, mama.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha watched as the two went to work, picking up the remainder of the toys. They stacked the hot wheels in their blue cases, dumped the wooden blocks into the large, clear bin, and gathered all of the miscellaneous items to place them on one of many shelves.</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time they were done, Agatha’s poor mood had dissipated entirely. She smiled as Rio walked toward her and dropped against her side. She waved Nicky over, raising her brows.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“One more step.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky squealed and climbed onto the couch. He gripped Agatha by her cheeks and began planting kisses all over her face. Rio matched him on the other side until Agatha was laughing, her heart so full she thought it might burst. She wrapped Nicky in her arms and pulled him tightly to her chest as he continued to laugh and squirm.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio leaned in, pressed her lips to Agatha’s jaw, and hummed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Dark Evil Scary Lord Rio of Death has other plans for Princess Mama.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha chuckled, her head turning to catch Rio’s lips in a light kiss.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sounds nefarious.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, it is.”</i>
</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha blinked at the butchering of her name, the double ‘f’ drawing her from her memory. She blinked and realized she was tearing up. Agatha cleared her throat and smiled at Billy.</p><p>“Sorry, I’m okay, Billy. Do you guys think we should pick up your toys so your mom and dad don’t have to do it?”</p><p>Both of them groaned but Tommy started dragging the tiles together. Billy looked at her shrewdly.</p><p>“Only if you read your book.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a pained breath, nodded.</p><p>“Yeah. I can do that.”</p><p>__________</p><p>Wanda and Vision walked into the room as Tommy and Billy carried the last tub of toys to the shelf.</p><p>Wanda put her hands on her hips, her best mom voice coming out.</p><p>“Wow, my boys are cleaning on their own!”</p><p>Vision pressed a hand to his chest and pretended to stumble.</p><p>“This is shocking!”</p><p>Tommy rolled his eyes, a pleased flush filling his cheeks as he straightened his shoulders.</p><p>Billy grinned.</p><p>“Agatha said she would read her book to us.”</p><p>Agatha felt a brief flash of embarrassment, like Wanda and Vision might not say yes.</p><p>Then Wanda’s eyes fell brightly on Agatha, an easy smile curling her lips.</p><p>“That is very kind of her.”</p><p>__________</p><p>The boys had grown sleepy, their eyes drooping soon after they finished cleaning. Vision had taken them to brush their teeth and Wanda had walked to sit beside Agatha on the floor, her legs kicking out in front of her.</p><p>“Are you okay to read that to them?”</p><p>Agatha looked at the book that had been placed into her hands by Billy before he ran upstairs.</p><p>“I think so.” She stared at the familiar cover, her chest only a little bit stiff. “I– Nicky loved it.” She shrugged, smiled. “He would stare at the pictures for so long sometimes that Rio would have to start over because he’d say he’d forgotten what happened.” Agatha chuckled. “He’d had the book memorized after a week.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, her hand slipping into Agatha’s and squeezing.</p><p>“He was so clever. And so thoughtful. Vision and I were always so shocked when he’d wait for everyone else to start eating. We thought it was a bit.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, her eyes watering again.</p><p>“God, he saw Rio do that twice and it became a law. Nobody ate unless everyone was eating.” Agatha stared at their clasped hands. “He wanted to be exactly like her. He would mimic her doing the smallest things. If she kissed me goodbye, he would kiss me goodbye. If she brought me flowers, he would have to take a few to give me himself.” Agatha sniffed, her head leaning against Wanda’s shoulder. “She was <i>such</i> a good mother, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda’s hand tightened in hers.</p><p>“You both were. I was so lucky to get to watch you before I had to do this myself. The amount of things that I stole from you specifically could fill a book.”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“Like how to stay sane? I heard about garage time. Very similar to office time where I pretended to work for five minutes to get a breather.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled.</p><p>“That, definitely. But, Agatha, you were so, so good. Sometimes I wonder if you know how good.” Wanda paused, then, “I don’t think I ever saw you snap at him. Not once. Nicky poured melted ice cream down your air vents in a fit of scientific discovery and you picked him up and carried him to the living room to talk. He once knocked over the cake you had painstakingly decorated to look like Thomas the Tank Engine and when he started to cry, you picked him up and pulled a second cake from the freezer. I couldn’t fucking believe it.”</p><p>Agatha remembered that day. His first birthday, a half-dozen kids from his daycare running around the house.</p><p>“I knew something bad was going to happen. I was going to give you the cake if it wasn’t needed.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled, then sighed.</p><p>“I’m serious though. I learned so much about how to love my kids. Hell, how to love Vision, from the two of you.”</p><p>Agatha let the words sink in, her mind veering to Rio for the twentieth time in as many minutes. She didn’t want to pry, didn’t want to force Wanda to be a go-between, but she needed to know.</p><p>“Is she okay?”</p><p>Wanda drew up a knee, her free arm resting on it.</p><p>“I don’t want to lie to you, Agatha, so I won’t. But I know she will be.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and didn’t open them again until Vision called down that the boys were ready for their bedtime story.</p><p>That was how Agatha ended up nestled in a twin-sized bed, Billy and Tommy on either side of her clinging to her arms as they peered down at the book. She flipped open the first page and began to read, her voices nowhere near as good as Rio’s.</p><p>Billy and Tommy giggled, their eyes wide as they studied the incredibly intricate art of every scene. They asked questions she couldn’t answer about how so many people fit in one tub, about if she really thought they’d put fish in the tub with them. She’d answered as best she could with the book’s lack of sense.</p><p>They were awake still, alert because the book was new and it was silly, and Tommy looked up at her with excitement.</p><p>“One more?!”</p><p>Agatha looked to where Vision was sitting in the rocking chair clearly trying to stay awake. He blinked, nodded, and Agatha found another book shoved into her hands.</p><p>__________</p><p>Vision had gone off to bed, offering Agatha a smile and wave after he’d carried Tommy to his own bed. Both boys had fallen asleep three pages into The Giving Tree and Agatha had to extricate herself without waking them up.</p><p>When she arrived downstairs, she found Wanda on her couch with a glass of red wine, her face painted with the lights from whatever television show she’d put on.</p><p>She paused it as Agatha walked in and motioned her toward the spot beside her on the couch.</p><p>“Wine is in the kitchen if you want any.”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“I think I’m taking a small breather from alcohol.” She walked into the room and peered at the screen. It was paused in such a way that she couldn’t parse out exactly what it was. “I know you did this in an effort to trick me. I’ve seen every episode a million times.”</p><p>Wanda crossed her arms.</p><p>“‘I Love Lucy’ is Timeless!”</p><p>Agatha groaned and headed for the door.</p><p>Wanda used her Senior Agent voice.</p><p>“Get your ass back here and sit down, Harkness. You have five fucking years of reruns to catch up on.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her head dramatically and turned. She settled into the spot beside Wanda and let her face reveal feigned distaste for the next hour.</p><p>It felt good.</p><p>Being present in space with others for hours with nothing to do, no job to complete, it rooted her; made her feel more human than she had in so long. She wasn’t chasing a moment that she knew would end, wasn’t bating her breath until the floor dropped out from under her.</p><p>She remembered, suddenly, the first time she’d felt like that. College had been close. She’d been able to stay on campus, make friends, learn outside of her mother’s sphere of influence. But her mother had visited and called, and texted and fucking emailed if Agatha went too long without contact. Every class had felt like a step closer to returning home. Eventually, she had. And it had been just as bad, worse even, than she’d ever expected.</p><p>Then she’d joined the FBI. It had been a terrifying endeavor, one done under the watch of her mother who was so certain Agatha would follow in her footsteps, become a godly woman of the church. Find a man to lead her to her death.</p><p>She remembered getting on the bus and closing her eyes the entire way, so afraid that she’d open them too soon and her mother would be there to scrape and tear at her until she listened.</p><p>The fear of failure had lasted until their first introduction, until her belongings were replaced with stiff uniforms and schedules and dietary plans.</p><p>She had thrived. She had become something else in her first two months of training.</p><p>Then, she met Rio. The first weeks of their burgeoning relationship had been rife with complexities and miscommunication. Her lips tugged up. It had become humorous to them in their marriage, after the barriers had been destroyed and the smoke had cleared.</p><p>
<i>The next morning, her body atrociously lethargic, a pleasant ache between her thighs, Agatha rose to run. She needed to let off steam, needed to think. She couldn’t stop the moments from the night before from steamrolling her. Vidal’s easy confidence, her constant ability to meet Agatha exactly where she was at, the way she’d moved so boldly into her space, into her bed, the way she’d picked Agatha apart, fucked her into her sheets, and dissappeared.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha tripped on the harness, the leather wrapping around her foot, the silicone knocking into her ankle as she nearly brained herself on the corner of her cabinet. She snarled loudly, the sound burning through her chest as she yanked on shorts and a t-shirt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time she made it to her regular spot– now <i>their</i> spot– Agatha half expected Vidal to be waiting anyway. Despite her comments about skipping, she was surprised to find the expanse of green empty.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She stretched and set off on her own. She didn’t time it, not like Vidal had apparently been doing, but she didn’t think she’d beat any PR today. Everything felt a beat slower, a half-step behind, and she finished her run without the normal sense of accomplishment. She sat down in the grass and stretched again.<br/>
________</i>
</p><p>
<i>She didn’t see Vidal until the late-start of their first class. They were going over a complex financial fraud case that Agatha felt confident she could solve on her own without the additional help of fifty other cohort members chiming in. She’d entered the class late, freshly showered and changed, and she’d seen Vidal as soon as Vidal saw her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded her greeting just as she felt the ghost of Rio’s hand against the back of her neck. She remembered the almost-callous way she had dressed and disappeared, and Agatha sat down in an available seat closest to the door. They didn’t always sit beside one another. It wasn’t abnormal for either of them to sit with other members of the cohort they were acquainted with. Hell, Rio often sat beside Maximoff.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha ignored the grating whisper in her head that that hadn’t been the case for the past week.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It would be disruptive for the remainder of the class if she walked to the very center of the room to claim the empty seat beside Vidal.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Something churlish twisted in Agatha’s chest and she didn’t look Vidal’s way for the remainder of the course. She hardly paid attention, something Agent Treadwell picked up on eventually.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Harkness.” Agatha looked up from her blank page, eyes blinking toward the front of the room. “We’ve heard from the entire class at this point. Any insight to share?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha offered him a disarming look, letting him think he’d caught her out. He was about to answer his own question when her expression sharpened.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you want me to touch on the Money Laundering Control Act or are you more interested in its predecessor? The BSA may have missed a few things but it still holds up. Specifically in this case.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agent Treadwell’s jaw tightened considerably as she met his stare. His words were clipped.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Either will be fine.”<br/>
________</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha slipped into her room after their firearms session instead of beelining to the cafeteria with the remainder of her cohort. She needed to get her shit together. She wasn’t some simpering fool. She was just thrown off by the fact that Vidal had been the one to cut and run; that was her area of expertise.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She tugged her shoes off and dropped back on her bed. Her nose wrinkled at the smell of sex that still lingered in the sheets. She made a note to have them washed and closed her eyes to take a short nap before she had to report to Hogan’s Alley.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d barely slipped into sleep when there was a knock on her door.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha knew who it was. She could feel her standing on the other side of the door. She intended to ignore her when another knock sounded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Harkness, stop being a fucking baby and open up.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha bristled, her legs flinging over the edge of the bed so she could stalk to the door. She yanked it open to find Vidal standing there with a smug look on her face and two trays of food in her hands.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Ah, she <i>can</i> see me. I was confused after three hours of being ignored.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha turned her embarrassment into irritation.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I feel like shit, Vidal. I’m trying to sleep it off.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal used the edge of the tray to push Agatha back so she could step inside. She took in the strap that was still sitting exactly where she left it, her brows raising. She set the trays on Agatha’s desk.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If that were true, you probably wouldn’t have gotten up early just to run.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Of course. She wasn’t sure how Vidal knew but she wasn’t surprised.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Running makes me feel better. Kills the nausea.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I was under the impression that it caused your nausea.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha closed the door harder than she needed to. She felt exposed. She hated the casual ease Vidal wore.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What do you want, Vidal?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>There was a flicker of something dark in Vidal’s eyes as she crossed her arms.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I want to know why you’re acting weird as fuck. Why you’re ignoring me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha moved to walk past, eyes on the mashed potatoes and gravy swimming on her plate.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal stepped in front of her, brow furrowing, irritation replacing the ease.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s stomach clenched, her eyes falling toward Vidal’s lips. She breathed out a challenge.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I thought we weren’t using our names unless we were fucking.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s lips quirked up, her hand lifting, her fingers settling into the waist of Agatha’s pants.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We could be.” She tugged. “Is that what you want?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mouth felt dry, her head suddenly foggy as her mind flashed back to the press of Rio’s hands on her body. She wanted to dismiss her, feign disinterest, but her voice was far less attuned to what her mind was attempting.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You get a taste and you’re desperate for seconds?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes narrowed at the deflection, her lips pulling up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I never actually…” she looked down at her hands, “got a taste.” She stepped into Agatha, pressing their hips together. “We have a bit of time to remedy that.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha couldn’t help the tug in her chest, the clench in her jaw as she ignored every instinct in her body to just give in.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You trying to knock me off my pedestal again?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes flashed, her lips drifting down, brushing against Agatha’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You looked so pretty on your knees.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s stomach clenched, a deep burn of arousal coursing through her. She fought the urge to throw Rio onto her bed as she gripped the back of her neck.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t expect to see that again.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She kissed Rio then, her mouth pressing hot against the seam of Rio’s lips. A pang of warmth, an uncomfortable sense of desire and hope, flooded through Agatha as Rio kissed her back. It didn’t feel like two friends ready to fuck out their tension. It felt real and terrifying and Agatha pulled back sooner than she wanted to.</i>
</p><p>
<i>With a patronizing pat to Rio’s cheek, she motioned to the door.</i>
</p><p><i>“If you’ll go, I’m still going to take that nap.”</i><br/>
_________</p><p>By the time Agatha made it back to the guest house, she was exhausted. A genuine sleepiness that came from activity rather than devastating sorrow or a need to escape for a few hours. She tucked herself under Nicky’s quilt, and, with very little in the way of pondering regret or insidious fear, she fell asleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha took her Sunday, likely the team’s last day off for quite some time, and spent most of it going over and documenting the notes her and Rio had developed on their serial killer. She made them digestible, providing snippets of information and blurbs of commentary that Rio had added that fed to the theory that their killer was psychopathic; living in a delusion. She provided possible theories to explore regarding the victimology and their connections to the symbols rather than their connections to one another.</p><p>She barely refrained from diving further in, her curiosity tugging at the limits of her self-control. She emailed her updates to the team so they could be prepared for the incoming agents from Cincinnati and Birmingham. She’d had to field multiple responses berating her for working on her days off and ended up closing her laptop around five. She had been working in her living room rather than at the desk in the bedroom in hopes that she might hear Billy coming to find her after they ate dinner. She’d missed his messes, having somebody, even the smallest somebody, bringing excitement into the space.</p><p>Around six, just as she’d finished the entire leftmost top corner of her puzzle, she heard his approach. He knocked lightly, a patter of his tiny fists, and Agatha opened the door to find him decked out in snow pants and boots and a thick jacket.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha’s strained heart settled, her lips pulling up.</p><p>“Hello, Billy.”</p><p>He reached for her hand and she offered hers back.</p><p>“We’re going to go sledding and look at Christmas lights.”</p><p>He’d already started pulling her and she laughed.</p><p>“Oh, are we?”</p><p>Billy looked at her with a frown, his lips curling down. His voice was tilted toward a whine.</p><p>“Do you need Agatha time?”</p><p>Agatha huffed and lifted her socked foot.</p><p>“No, just shoes. Unless you want me to turn into a snowman.”</p><p>Billy giggled and let go of her hand.</p><p>“That is what Aunti Rio says.”</p><p>Agatha paused as she reached for her boots. She clenched and released her jaw. Then she offered Billy a pained smile.</p><p>“Is it really?”</p><p>He grinned and shuffled impatiently as she finished pulling on her coat.</p><p>“Yeah, she says that snowmen are people who didn’t wear their coats.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly.</p><p>“Sounds true to me.</p><p>Billy crossed his arms.</p><p>“I made a snowman with Tommy and dad.”</p><p>Agatha made a face as she slid her arms into the sleeves.</p><p>“That’s clearly a different type of snowman.”</p><p>Billy’s expression was exaggerated as he tried to decide if she was telling him a fib.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and nudged him out the door so she could step out onto the porch and lock her door. He took her hand in his again and pulled her toward the main house where Vision and Wanda were stepping out with Tommy.</p><p>Wanda lifted a brow at Agatha.</p><p>“He convinced you to go sledding with us?”</p><p>Agatha let out a dismissive sound.</p><p>“Not a chance. I’ll look at the lights.”</p><p>Tommy shook his head.</p><p>“No you can’t look at the lights if you don’t sled. It’s the rules.”</p><p>Agatha shot him a look.</p><p>“You made that up.”</p><p>Instead of arguing, he laughed and sprinted toward the car. The next five seconds were filled with the repetitive thudding of the locked handle being yanked over and over again.</p><p>Vision unlocked the car and Billy pulled her toward the second row.</p><p>“You can sit by me!”</p><p>Agatha grimaced at the middle seat between two large car seats.</p><p>“How about your mom or dad?”</p><p>Billy didn’t even seem to hear as he pulled her to the car and let go, his hand tapping on her leg to urge her inside. Agatha glared at Wanda who was climbing happily into the passenger seat. She gave Agatha a smug grin in the rearview mirror.</p><p>Vision slid into the driver’s seat and turned around, smiling widely.</p><p>“Who’s ready!?”</p><p>Billy and Tommy threw up their arms, screeching, and Agatha’s eyes widened as they pierced her eardrums.</p><p>She started to stand.</p><p>“On second thought, I might need that Agatha time.”</p><p>The screeching turned toward shouts to Vision for him to drive away as Billy clutched at her arm.</p><p>Agatha let herself fall back into her seat as Vision eased backward at a snail’s pace.</p><p>Tommy and Billy were both holding onto her sleeves now, their laughter still filling the car, and Agatha avoided Wanda’s eyes in the rearview mirror as they pulled away.</p><p>_______</p><p>“I’m not climbing that hill.”</p><p>Wanda and Vision were both panting, their cheeks red, their breath visible in the cold as Billy and Tommy bounced and begged to be taken up again. Vision learned heavily on Wanda, his arm thrown over her shoulder.</p><p>“Agatha, for the love of god, please.”</p><p>He heaved, his hat sitting lopsided on his head, his blonde hair sticking out at odd angles.</p><p>Wanda shrugged Vision off and stuck her hands on her head, elbows out. She groaned when Billy and Tommy became less eager and more whiny, their eyes on the crest of the hill.</p><p>Agatha could see where this was going, could feel the impending moment that Billy and Tommy turned their begging toward her. She glared at Wanda.</p><p>“You better be fucking joking, Maximoff. You ran six miles easy within the last month!”</p><p>Wanda bent over, her hair falling in front of her face.</p><p>“You try marching up that goddamn hill five times and then come talk to me.”</p><p>Wanda heaved in a breath just as Billy and Tommys’ eyes fell to Agatha.</p><p>Billy ran over.</p><p>“Please? We have to go again.”</p><p>Tommy sidled up and pouted, and Agatha genuinely thought she might make a run for it. She did <i>not</i> go sledding.</p><p>Billy tugged at her, his sled held in his gloved hand. Agatha felt her feet move in the wrong direction, her eyes falling to Wanda imploringly as she started the trek up the hill. She’d made it halfway, both boys heaving excitedly, when Wanda called up after her.</p><p>“Try not to shatter your collarbone this time!”</p><p>Her voice was distinctly non-winded, cutting through the screaming of children like a slap to the face. She turned and Wanda, even in the darkening sky, looked smug.</p><p>Agatha grit her teeth and began a faster march to the top.</p><p>
<i>”Shhhh! Shut the fuck up, Bohner. If we get caught here they’re going to stick us on desk duty for a year.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was running through deep snow with thirty-two others trailing behind her. Wanda was at her left– gag– and Rio had taken up her right. They had stolen metal trays from the cafeteria, their last week of training nearly at an end. Every single one of them was decked out in their toughest boots, their training pants, and Rio had suggested the horrific idea to wear their uniform t-shirts.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was already freezing before they reached the base of the largest hill on the campus. Agatha didn’t slow her run as she started forging a path up the steep grade, her boots slipping in the thick snow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time they reached the top, nobody was whispering or laughing, the sound of their breathing and the slide of cargo against itself were the only audible noises. Agatha reached the top and dropped, her body no longer cold, her warm skin cooling in the snow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio laughed and reached for her as several of the remaining cohort members wasted no time in launching themselves down the hill with Wanda in the lead.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha let herself get yanked up, their hands cold and wet against one another. She could hardly see Rio’s face, let alone her eyes, but she smiled at her all the same.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Ready to lose, Vidal?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s cold hand left hers, her fingers poking gently at Agatha’s forehead.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fat fucking chance, Harkness.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha waited until Rio had turned before jamming her foot into the back of Rio's knee and sending her to the ground.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Eat shit!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha sprinted forward and leapt, holding the tray in front of her so she landed heavily against the metal. She heard Rio swearing and chasing after her just as she tilted toward the steepest part of the hill.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The wind whistled past her ears as she pickled up speed, the brief respite from the cold vanished. Snow spurted up into her eyes and smacked against her cheeks as she careened nearly blind down the semi-packed snow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>In reality, thirty-two successful candidates should have considered the possible outcomes of sledding down a massive hill with no intentions nor ability to keep track of one another.</i>
</p><p>
<i>All that Agatha’s senses picked up before disaster were the sounds of Rio riding her heels and a groan from several meters in front of her. She was flying, nearing the end of the decline, when her body slammed into a pair of ankles.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Pain burst against her collarbone, her shoulder, her neck, her body falling in front the tray and tangling with another person as they tumbled the remaining feet at speed. Agatha couldn’t breathe, couldn’t make a sound as the person half-on-top of her groaned in pain.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She rolled to a stop as Rio nearly crashed into them. The visibility had increased just enough closer to the buildings for her to make out the pile of their bodies and she rolled off of her tray instead.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha tried to shove the person off of her and she felt a flare of pain in her left shoulder. She started to panic as her lack of ability to draw in air became a problem.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Then suddenly, the body was yanked off of her, the person discarded to the side like a sack of flour.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio dropped into the snow by her side, her dark eyes wide in worry as she carefully touched her shoulder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s breath whistled into her lungs and she heard a general groaning coming from multiple people out of her sight. She closed her eyes until she was certain she wasn’t going to pass out.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fuck.” She tried to sit up and hissed. “Jesus fuck.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio put a hand behind her back and helped her up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Anything broken?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha chuckled and the motion hurt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Possibly.” She let her left arm hand loosely as she reached out her right. “Can you help me–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I got you.” Rio’s arms wrapped around her right side and she carefully pulled her to her feet. “Do you need the clinic?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s entire upper chest and shoulder and back were throbbing violently. She was fucking soaked, her skin freezing, her face a brittle cold that had her shivering.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No. I just need a hot shower.”<br/>
_________</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d found out the next day that Agatha’s collarbone had been a lesser of the many injuries from their cohort. There were two broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, and several bruises gained by the supposedly-intelligent, soon-to-be FBI agents. She had nearly fractured Bohner’s ankles on the hit but he was recovering with a mild strain.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had a bone bruise, something she’d found out without revealing her involvement in what their instructors dubbed ‘the sledding incident.’</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had helped her back to her room and opened the door, both of them shaking considerably through their bouts of laughter. As soon as they stepped inside, Rio threw off her uniform shirt and kicked off her boots. She shoved her wet pants down her legs and rubbed her arms aggressively to warm them up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha could hardly enjoy the show, her eyes only lingering a moment, before the pulsing, very clearly at her collarbone, drew her attention. She tried to kick off her shoes but Rio stepped toward her in her sports bra and underwear and guided Agatha to her bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hang on. Sit.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She knelt down beside Agatha, expression becoming serious as she unlaced and pulled off her boots. She was nearly clinical as she unbuttoned and unzipped Agatha’s pants, urging her to stand so she could slip them off. Rio studied Agatha’s shoulder and carefully gripped the hem of her shirt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We’ll take it slow, okay?” She peeled the damp garment from her stomach and freed Agatha’s left arm with little issue. It hung cold and wet on Agatha’s shoulder and Rio carefully slipped it over her head. “You alright?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wasn’t sure what to do with Rio’s gentle care. This wasn’t what they did.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She cleared her throat and pushed the shirt from her right arm instead of waiting for Rio to do so. Her skin prickled and she watched Rio step close, her fingers settling on Agatha’s shoulder. She gently ran her finger along Agatha’s collarbone to see if it remained intact.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hissed as Rio pressed against the start of a large bruise.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio smirked lightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s not broken. Doesn’t rule out a fracture but you may just have a bone contusion.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her eyes, shifting herself away from Rio’s touch.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Is that your professional opinion, doctor?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio chuckled and reached for her again. She drew Agatha back, her arms wrapping around her waist, their cold skin pressing together.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yeah, do you want your prescription?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha closed her eyes, glad Rio couldn’t see her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sure.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio hummed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think a long, hot shower would really aid in your recovery.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s chest rumbled with her laugh, her head fully leaning against Rio’s shoulder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You think? Where’s your prognostic confidence?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sighed forlornly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“With the eight to fifteen years of medical school, residency, and fellowship I have yet to complete.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed even though it jostled her stiffening, aching shoulder. She stepped away from Rio’s warmth to get her towel and she tossed a second to Rio.</i>
</p><p><i>“I think we can trust your instincts on this one.”</i><br/>
_________</p><p>Agatha reached the top of the sledding hill and both Billy and Tommy turned to her, holding out their sleds.</p><p>Agatha jumped in before they could begin arguing over who would pair up with who.</p><p>“Why don’t you both ride together and I’ll race you?”</p><p>Billy shoved his sled in her hands and grabbed at Tommy’s. They got themselves settled and stared in excitement at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha looked at the hill, far less steep than the one that had decimated her cohort. She looked where Wanda and Vision were waiting and narrowed her eyes. She placed the sled and sat inside, her hands latching around the handles.</p><p>Tommy was sitting in front, his head turned. Both boys looked ready to scoot and Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“Alright. On your marks… get set….” She grinned. “Go!”</p><p>Agatha let them go first. She had a different mission.</p><p>The boys began screaming within seconds, Tommy’s hands flying up as Billy clung to the handles. Agatha pushed off and aimed herself toward Wanda.</p><p>The wind picked up as she gained ground, cutting through her jeans and numbing her bare fingers. She lifted and leaned when she began to veer.</p><p>She was on the boys’ tail and both kept looking back and giggling as she closed in.</p><p>Wanda was none-the-wiser as she recorded them on their journey. Agatha felt the clench of adrenaline, the surge as she continued to pick up speed. As they neared the bottom, Agatha turned sharply, the sled’s nose pointing directly at Wanda.</p><p>It happened in seconds, Wanda yelping, trying to dive away, Agatha reaching out as she passed and clotheslining her legs from under her. The impact hurt like a bitch but she watched as Wanda ate absolute shit in the piles of snow.</p><p>Agatha skidded out, fell off of her sled, and tumbled in the snow several feet away.</p><p>She heard Vision’s laughter, then Wanda’s, and she realized her body was shaking with it as she rolled onto her knees to get up. Billy and Tommy missed the entire debacle but had no issue joining in with the adults as Wanda pushed herself to her feet.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders out and groaned.</p><p>“You were twenty-six when you went down that hill! I’m pushing forty!”</p><p>Agatha’s face ached from the cold and her mouth was dry from her laughter. She stood slowly and shook out her hand as she continued to chuckle.</p><p>“Your ankles are made of iron.”</p><p>Tommy dragged his sled over.</p><p>“Ankles are bones!”</p><p>Agatha heaved in a breath and nodded.</p><p>“You are so right.”</p><p>He smiled at her, his normal reservation and distinct lack of interest nowhere to be found.</p><p>A cold, packed wad of snow slammed into the back of her head as a smaller, far less impactful one hit her shoulder.</p><p>She looked to find Wanda and Billy sprinting away, both of them scrounging for snow. Billy toppled over and Wanda tugged him free.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Tommy and raised a brow.</p><p>“You want to be on the winning team?”</p><p>Tommy giggled and immediately dropped and began scooping snow toward himself.</p><p>Agatha knelt beside him and stuck her ice-chilled hands into the snow.</p><p>_________</p><p>Agatha regretted the need to wake up so early the next morning. She was sore from doing absurdities like sledding and having a snowball fight with small children who never grew tired. She rolled out of bed, let her muscles settle, and pulled on a dark sage turtleneck and her off-white slacks and blazer. She skipped breakfast. By the time she’d made her way downstairs, her stomach was a hornet’s nest. The anxiety had spread from her chest to her lungs to the bottoms of her feet and she was trying to swallow back the nausea that seeped up her throat.</p><p>She climbed into her car and pointedly avoided looking at her passenger seat.</p><p>She sent a quick text to Wanda that she was leaving early and pulled out of the driveway. Her initial plan had included a return trip to the home she hadn’t seen since she ran. It had seemed like a fine idea when she had written the letter, stuck in the pain of it, but now she was certain she couldn’t do so.</p><p>She drove to the post office, arriving too early to be able to go inside, and sat in her car with her hand tightly wrapped around the wheel.</p><p>It took her ten minutes to look at the letter, five more to pick it up and scrawl her old address on the face of it. Her hand shook as she wrote the familiar numbers and the street she’d expected to grow old in.</p><p>She sat for another ten minutes before she was able to step out of the car and walk to the deposit slot. She shoved it inside before she could lose her nerve.</p><p>A deep, terrified regret shattered her thin facade of calm and she drew in a breath. She knew that the alternative to this was facing her past, but now that she would be forced to <i>wait</i>, to consider the what ifs, she wasn’t sure which was worse.</p><p>Agatha’s knee bounced violently as she drove into work and she cranked the dial, Ray and Dave Davies belting into her car. By the time she arrived she felt like she’d been holding onto an electric fence with both hands.</p><p>Agatha quickly made her way inside and beelined for her office. She tossed her shit on the desk and froze. She remembered the clack of her chair against the wall as she’d stood abruptly. It had been returned to its position neatly and the chair Rio had replaced the seat she’d dragged behind the desk in its proper place. Written on four sticky notes set beneath her keyboard were dozens of words in Rio’s distinct writing.</p><p>She couldn’t stop her feet from moving, couldn’t avert her eyes, and she sat down to find Rio’s notes on their last discovery along with a few helpful distinctions between the civilizations they’d pinpointed.</p><p>Agatha ran her fingers over the notes, her heart in her throat.</p><p>
<i>Agatha had spent the next several days trying to fall back in rhythm. She woke up early, ran with Vidal, participated and excelled in classes, trained to close out most of her days. Their dynamic had shifted, the curiosity and burgeoning excitement shifting to galvanizing tension. Rio’s eyes lingered, searching, studying, exposing. Agatha could feel her attention at her back on their runs, on the side of her face during their classes, on her body when they trained.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s lingering was far more physical in nature. She had never been particularly touchy with anyone in her past. Yet, somehow, she felt as if her hands were constantly finding reasons to <i>touch</i>. A press to Vidal’s back to move her out of her way, the brush of shoulders when they walked side by side, the lag that had developed when Agatha pulled Vidal to her feet or vice versa. Every time they were paired in combat, Agatha had to force her mind to focus and her body to activate her muscle memory.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Their training at night was near torture. Agatha had begun to believe she might be losing her mind every time Vidal caught her, submitted her, and she felt feral at the power rather than frustrated about the loss.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nothing had occurred since Vidal had brought her lunch and Agatha had kissed her as a dismissal. There were moments where Agatha felt like a drawn bow, so ready to release or snap that she could hardly breathe.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But they always parted before their doors now. Rio on that first night. Agatha on the next two. It was becoming an uncomfortable strain to Agatha’s days. The anticipation was nearly debilitating and she found herself aggravated that Vidal seemed so fucking calm despite the heated gaze she never withdrew.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s jaw ached from the amount of time she’d spent clenching it and she thought she might be overdue for some time alone.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Several members of her cohort were going out but she’d turned down their invites. She tossed on jeans and a weathered band tee with ‘The Strokes’ written in large letters across the chest. She’d planned to drop by Vidal’s to let her know she wasn’t in for training; that she wanted the night to herself. She needed relief and Vidal was clearly not intending to be the one to provide that. There were dozens of women within walking distance that would.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She opened her door and found Vidal raising a hand to knock.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal lowered her hand slowly, her eyes running up and down Agatha’s appearance. She tilted her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Change of plans?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stared at her thighs under her shorts, the muscles visible even when she was relaxed. She swallowed at the thin strip of skin under Vidal’s cropped shirt. Vidal’s arms were bare to the shoulder, the sleeves cut off. Agatha’s voice was a little breathless in her response.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yeah. Get dressed.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wanted to drive her head into the doorframe repeatedly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal’s brow rose, a smirk lifting and settling to a grin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes, ma’am.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>As she turned away, Agatha held her hands out, mouthing vitriol herself as she turned back around. She was an idiot. She was weak. She wouldn’t be able to focus on anything else if Vidal was within a ten-foot radius. This was becoming absurd.<br/>
_________</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was limiting her beer intake. She wasn’t sure what she would do if she drank to carelessness, but she knew it wouldn’t be something she could live down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Even now, a mild buzz coursing through her, she couldn’t take her fucking eyes off of the way Vidal was staring so intently at the air hockey table, her eyes locked onto the puck. She had a wicked smile on her face as she slammed the puck into the wall.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha defended, dribbled the puck, and sent it back with less precision than she’d have wanted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>This was their third game, each one sitting on a win, and Agatha was dead-set on crushing Vidal.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The game buzzed as Vidal’s next shot crashed into her goal. The score was now 5-6 and Agatha set her beer on the closest table.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal hummed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, she’s getting serious.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pulled the pick and placed it on the table where it floated slowly to the right. She took a deep breath.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I prefer you when you’re losing, Vidal.” Agatha leaned down, aligning her shot. “At least when we played pool you made a show of it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha slapped her shot against both walls before it sank into the slot.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Neither of them reacted to the blare of the goal. Vidal didn’t reach to retrieve the puck. Her expression transformed like it had the first time they’d drunk themselves stupid. It turned predatory, heated, and Agatha could feel the way her breathing hitched and grew heavy. Her chest rose and fell as she clenched her hand around the plastic pusher.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Slowly, Vidal leaned down and withdrew the puck. She placed it on the board, a challenge broiling in her gaze.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Loser buys shots.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shrugged.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The ensuing cacophony of the puck bouncing on the boundaries and their pushers and the edge of the goals last long enough that Agatha was starting to sweat. Both of them were locked in, their postures far too athletic for a simple game of air-hockey.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d drawn the attention of several of the closest tables and only the blasting music kept the sound of the game from being irritating.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha made the mistake of looking at Vidal’s face a minute into their battle. Her enjoyment was clear, teeth bright in the dim light of the bar, her tongue was pressed against the right incisor. Agatha lost focus for a split second too long and the sound of the buzzer and the jingle that played before announcing the winner rang in her ears.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She stood to height and considered the ramifications of dragging Vidal into the tiny bathroom at the back of the bar.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal threw up both hands and stepped away from the table. There was a slight sheen of sweat on her face as she sauntered smugly toward Agatha. She stepped close, hand pressing against Agatha’s hip, lips touching Agatha’s ear.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you want a show, you have to earn it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She patted Agatha’s side and stepped around her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was molten. She was nearly certain she’d never been turned on to the point of pain before. She followed Vidal to the bar, throwing back the rest of her beer and losing her commitment to remaining coherent.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal was already sitting and speaking with the bartender as Agatha approached. She motioned vaguely in Agatha’s direction.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“She’s paying.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha passed over her card, the motion bringing her chest against Vidal’s back. She didn’t retreat, her hand settling on the bar beside Vidal’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her fucking voice. It was a warning and a promise in one and Agatha was obsessed with the way her name sounded on her lips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hm?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vidal leaned back against her, her head resting under Agatha’s chin. Her chest rose and fell harshly as her hand slid over Agatha’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think we should leave after these shots.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha let Rio’s fingers fall into hers and she held it until the receipt was placed in front of her. She added a tip, signed, and took the rightmost shot to her lips as Rio did the same with the left.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The burn of tequila on her throat was enough to distract Agatha for just a moment before she stepped back and headed for the door.<br/>
________</i>
</p><p>
<i>The return trip was agonizing and they were almost intercepted by a lategoing group of their cohort after they’d entered the base. Rio had snatched Agatha’s arm and pulled her toward the other dorm entrance.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They arrived at Rio’s door first and Agatha kept her hands to herself as Rio let them in.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Instead of a flurry of motion, the bow snapping, Agatha ran a hand through her mass of hair. She was still only buzzed as she took in the relatively sparse room. Rio’s bed was made and her desk was stacked ridiculously high with books. Sticky notes were plastered across every inch of wood and Agatha couldn’t make out what they were from there.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes flared as she turned to take Agatha in. She stepped against her, palm pressing Agatha into the door by her ribs.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck and her head fell back against the door as Rio’s knee pressed up between her thighs.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She gasped as Rio’s teeth caught her ear, her breath hot as she rasped, sounding almost angry.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You make me fucking crazy.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hands slid under her shirt, fingertips skating along her ribs and to her chest. She pulled back captured Agatha’s lips in an open-mouthed kiss, her tongue insistent, dragging against Agatha’s and drawing out a moan. She pushed her knee up against the seam of Agatha’s jeans.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha clenched on nothing, her body trembling as she pulled Rio’s harder against her and drove her hips down. She yanked at the hem of Rio’s shirt and forced it over her head, breaking the kiss for a moment before they clashed again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She let her hands wander as she tried to press Rio back toward the bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha allowed her own shirt to be pushed over her head and the press of their feverish skin together had both of them panting into one another’s mouths. Agatha would come the moment Rio fucking touched her and she wasn’t ready for the high to crest just yet. She knelt down in front of Rio, knees on the thin carpet, and worked the button on her jeans.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She looked up and found Rio staring at her, her hair hanging against her cheeks and around her eyes, her lips swollen and her eyes dark.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha gripped the jeans and drew them down Rio’s legs. She pressed her hand against Rio’s lower stomach and pushed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sat back, her chest rising and falling, her face so fucking pretty in its desperation.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s nails scratched into the revealed skin of Rio’s thighs, her gaze falling to the boyshorts Rio had on, the fabric tight to her thighs and hips. The black fabric was damp and Agatha’s mouth watered as she pressed a kiss to Rio’s knee. She could smell her, the heady scent of arousal sinking into Agatha’s body.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s stomach clenched, released, clenched again. She reached forward and slid her fingers into Agatha’s hair before tightening it into a fist.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mouth fell open, her teeth biting into the skin of Rio’s thigh as the pain grounded her. She gripped Rio’s hips and pressed her lips against her covered clit. Rio’s hips lifted up, a gasp leaving her, and she tightened her hold on Agatha’s hair.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha slid Rio’s underwear from her hips and helped it over her ass and thighs. She pushed both garments from Rio’s feet and returned her gaze. She nearly moaned at the sight of her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She pressed two fingers between her slick folds, parted her, and leaned in to drag her tongue in a broad stroke from her entrance to her clit. She tasted divine.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s breath was pitched high, her moan muffled by what Agatha assumed to be her other hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha slid her arms under Rio’s thighs and wrapped around them to keep her still as she pressed the flat of her tongue against her, sliding up and down with a steady pressure.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio ground into her mouth, her fist pulled Agatha’s face tighter against her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha took her time, tasted and tested and teased until Rio was squirming, her hips hardly touching the bed, her sounds pathetic and drawn out. Agatha moaned against her cunt, her tongue sliding inside before she licked up to her clit and closed her lips around it. She sucked, let her teeth just barely graze it, and repeated.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio cried out behind her hand and Agatha grinned as she pulled one hand back. She slid two fingers inside and pulsed them against Rio’s front wall as she continued working her clit with her mouth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s body pulled taut and the hand in Agatha’s hair became almost too tight as Rio began to rock into her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her fingers over and over as she narrowed her attention to Rio’s clit, her tongue sliding side to side. The angle caught Rio perfectly, the new sensation forcing a whine from her lips as her legs shook, her cunt clenching tightly around Agatha’s fingers as she worked her through her orgasm.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She waited until Rio’s shaking had slowed before removing her mouth and looking up as she kept her hand moving.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes blinked open and she panted, keeping eye contact as Agatha picked up the pace and drove into her hard and slow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha could feel the slick painted across her mouth and chin and her hips stuttered down. The hand in her hair tugged and Agatha let Rio pull her into a kiss.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She had the most terrifying revelation, with Rio’s tongue in her mouth and her fingers knuckle deep in her warmth, that she could easily do this forever.</i>
</p><p>________</p><p>Agatha sat in her chair and ran a hand over her eyes, squeezing at her temples. She made herself work, made herself focus so that she could put Rio somewhere else for even a moment. She continued her search to identify more of the symbols and barely noticed the rest of the team begin to arrive.</p><p>William burst into the office an hour after her arrival with two coffees and an excited smile.</p><p>“Agatha! How was your Christmas?”</p><p>Agatha blinked away the clinical focus she had sunken into and frowned.</p><p>“Fantastic.”</p><p>William didn’t seem to believe her, his lips turning down as he presented her coffee. She noted his eyes tracking across her desk and did not tell him his gift was stuffed in a drawer because the thought of seeing Rio look at her like that made her dizzy.</p><p>She took the coffee from his hand and leaned back.</p><p>“How was your Christmas, William?”</p><p>He hesitated as he turned to his own desk, his eyes widening at the question.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, it was great!” He moved to sit down. “Teddy and my dad had the games on in the background and it became a competition for mom and I to see who could turn the volume down the most without getting caught.”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she slid her keyboard to cover the sticky notes.</p><p>“Who won?”</p><p>William groaned dramatically.</p><p>“My mom. She <i>really</i> hates football. I think she eventually got the television off for at least ten minutes.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled as she pulled up the images of the many victims of their serial killer. She noted William peering at her from over his computer screen like he was confused. She ignored him entirely.</p><p>They sat in silence, William’s attention diverting for only minutes before it returned. When she said nothing, he leaned to see her better.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha groaned, stood, and poured the rest of her coffee down her throat.</p><p>“I’m thriving. Excelling. Just dandy.” She walked out the door. “I’m going to get another coffee.”<br/>
________</p><p>By nine, everyone was preparing the war room for the arrival of the visiting agents. Wanda had prepared copies of their updated case files to share and she stacked them near the front of the room. The remaining tables were lined in two rows of four facing the front screen.</p><p>The first arrivals were the agents from Birmingham, their team of five led by a man in his early forties. He shook Wanda’s hand, introduced the four other members curtly. He seemed severe, his graying, brown mustache covering the most prominent lines of expression on his face. He had accepted his balding and shaved his entire head. His team sat down, three men and a woman, and Wanda read the situation quickly. She passed them the files so they could immediately dive into the new updates from the team.</p><p>Agatha refrained from entering their operations room until it was packed with a dozen agents, all eyes on the work Agatha and Rio had pieced together over their four hours tucked away from the world.</p><p>There was chatter and quiet conversations as they picked apart the new evidence and marked it against their own research.</p><p>The Cincinnati team had arrived soon after and Agatha ignored the jolt of anxiety when Bohner filed into the room with his team. She wasn’t sure she’d be able to handle seeing him in a senior role, but her rising fears were settled quite quickly as he sat with his team on the opposite side of Birmingham’s while a tall woman with dark skin approached Wanda.</p><p>William stood from his desk, his curiosity finally drawn from Agatha to the room.</p><p>“Do you think this will go well?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged and looked at Rio’s notes that she’d transcribed onto her actual notepad.</p><p>“It’s about fifty-fifty. Sometimes everyone is happy to collaborate. Other times, its three separate entities jockeying for the attention and benefits that come from solving a high-profile case.”</p><p>William leaned against the edge of her desk.</p><p>“Do you think they’ll be mad that you found what they couldn’t? Cinci had the case for three weeks. Birmingham for almost two months.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows.</p><p>“Most definitely.”</p><p>William laughed at the questioning look she sent him.</p><p>“I may have read through your additional notes yesterday. How did you find all of that?”</p><p>Agatha glanced over to find Wanda motioning for them. She stood.</p><p>“You have to know how to research.” She started to walk away and stopped, letting out a sigh. “It wasn’t just me. Director Vidal’s–” She cleared her throat. “insight… was beneficial.”</p><p>“Director Vidal? Does she often engage with–”</p><p>Agatha walked out of the room before he could finish the question. She took a seat near the back, William hustling to sit beside her, and watched as the three Senior Agents converged at the front.</p><p>Lilia and Jen sat on either side of them and Alice pulled up a chair.</p><p>Jen frowned.</p><p>“I don’t like all of these people in our business.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Ironic.”</p><p>Jen leaned around William but her rebuttal was cut off by the start of the briefing.</p><p>The Birmingham Agent, Rodriguez, started them off with a full breakdown of the details everyone was already privy to. It was a drag, a solid hour of regurgitated data and evidence that had Agatha wishing she could slip back into her office to continue her research. She’d just finished sliding back her chair to escape when the door to the war room opened again.</p><p>Agatha’s heart dropped, her skin icing over as Rio stepped inside. She stopped breathing and the monotonous droning of Agent Rodriguez became an indiscernible mumble.</p><p>Rio wore her navy suit, the tailored pants and blazer sitting perfectly over her white shirt, the collar starched around her neck, top two buttons undone. Her hair was loose but pushed behind her ears and she looked– Agatha drew in a ragged breath.</p><p>Rio, as she always presented herself, was like stone. The weight of her presence filled the room, turned the heads of the teams, interrupted the flow of the Senior Agent Rodriguez currently covering the locations of each victim’s body.</p><p>But it was like a veil had been lifted from Agatha’s eyes, like she had been living the past several months with an imperfect gaze.</p><p>Because, while Rio was stone, she was chipped, imperfect. Cracks, so thin they were almost impossible to see, made themselves apparent to Agatha like streaks of lead on white paper. Rio’s perfect mask was not so perfect.</p><p>A part of her had hoped her sudden ability to <i>see</i> was a fluke. That Rio had been the one to change, Rio was the one to reveal herself when she’d sat in Agatha’s office and looked up with such agonizing hope. When she’d gripped the wheel of the car and tried to force all of her emotions back into their proper places. When she’d broken down on the beach.</p><p>But this was Director Vidal, the easy control, the straightened spine, and Agatha could still <i>see</i> her. Rio looked tired. She looked more than tired. She looked like she emptied herself out and left the best parts somewhere where they wouldn’t cause her pain.</p><p>Agatha glanced around the room and she knew with a certainty that she was the only one seeing it. A sense of odd wonder flooded her and she let her eyes fall to Rio again. Every line of her was so familiar.</p><p>When had she forgotten? How had she forgotten?</p><p>The guilt came sharply. Who had she been seeing if it wasn’t the woman who had become her entire world? How could she have written off, written out, the person she’d chosen to create a home with? A family?</p><p>It was as if she’d constructed a puppet and replaced Rio with something soulless. Something easy to distance herself from, to maintain control over.</p><p>Agatha felt the creeping, deadly reach of panic flare in her chest as Rio took a seat near the back of the room on the opposite side of Agatha. Rio hadn’t looked at her, hadn’t given her attention to anyone until she was situated in her chair. Only then did she give a nod for Rodriguez to continue.</p><p>He nodded and eased back into connections between the specific spacing of the bodies within clearings and the types of trees found nearby.</p><p>Agatha zoned out as Senior Agent LeBlanc took over and shared the specific developments from their killer’s movements in Ohio.</p><p>She clenched her hands into fists and kept her eyes locked onto the woodgrain of the table below her to keep from seeking out Rio across the room.</p><p>William leaned in her direction and she held a hand out to stop whatever asinine question he thought was appropriate to pose while their entire team and two others were gathered. Instead of a whirl of continuous thoughts about Rio, her mind was like a dead radio station with bits and pieces of traffic picking up and dropping out.</p><p>She lost track of time, of her surroundings, and the buzzing only cut out when Wanda spoke her name.</p><p>“Agent Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha blinked and flushed, hoping this was the first time her name had been said. Wanda didn’t look worried and Agatha violently stuffed her anxiety down as she stood and moved toward the front of the room.</p><p>All attention moved to her, Bohner’s eyes locking onto her with his stupid smile spread wide. He was dumb enough to wave and Agatha ignored him entirely.</p><p>“Director Vidal and the team were able to isolate a repeating pattern in the carvings on the victims’ bodies.”</p><p>She ignored the strange looks she received from her team as she expounded upon their discovery. She successfully dissociated, her emotions dampened to numbness, and her eyes landing anywhere but Rio as she delved into possible theories and the added insight Rio had provided through her sticky notes.</p><p>She’d nearly reached the end, finish line in sight, when the war room door opened again. Agatha didn’t stop– assuming whomever it was could ease in quietly– until the newcomer cleared their throat.</p><p>Agatha glanced behind her and nearly groaned.</p><p>The man looked somewhat alarmed to have interrupted. He nudged the blue mail cart in front of him and his eyes flickered to the closest faces.</p><p>“My apologies for interrupting. The instructions left by A. Harkness said that this was to be delivered upon arrival and–” He glanced at the note. “that the contents of the package were not a threat and did not need to be vetted and searched.” He looked up. “Unfortunately, all packages need to be vetted and searched. It’s the cause for the delay.”</p><p>When he remained standing, Agatha felt her emotions like an undercurrent, an anger that was greatly misplaced. She held out her hands.</p><p>“Do you have a poem to read with your delivery or can you set it to the side and get the hell out?”</p><p>The man paled and quickly found the large box amongst the packages and sorted mail. He lifted it, looked around in distress, and then looked to Agatha again.</p><p>She fought to stay beneath the waves. The roiling in her body and the skittering of too many feelings were distinctly similar to what she’d experienced on Christmas day.</p><p>“Put the box on the ground.”</p><p>Her voice snapped, whiplike, and the man quickly set the box down by the door and grabbed his cart. He hesitated, picked up a thick clipboard, and looked at her.</p><p>“Um, we actually need A. Harkness to–”</p><p>“Leave.”</p><p>He dropped the clipboard onto his cart and nodded too many times as he dragged it outside. The wheels screeched against the linoleum in his hurry and Agatha felt the sound echo inside her brain.</p><p>She needed a moment or twenty to gather herself before she ripped somebody's head off. She looked back to the room and saw multiple pairs of eyes watching her in the awkward vacuum left behind by the delivery man’s dismissal.</p><p>She glanced at Wanda and, to her utter relief, Wanda understood.</p><p>Wanda’s voice carried over the room.</p><p>“Let’s take a brief intermission before we continue. There’s coffee in the kitchen and the pantry has an assortment of rather dull granola bars for you to choose from.”</p><p>The tension in the room eased as conversation broke out and chairs skidded and scratched backward. Everyone’s eyes left her and she pulled in a heavy breath.</p><p>She just needed to make it to her office. She needed to sit down, strongarm her brain into submission, and make it through the rest of the day without cracking apart. She’d just reached the table where her team still sat when Bohner’s voice called out behind her.</p><p>“Harkness!”</p><p>She tensed. Alarms blared in her skull as she turned around.</p><p>“Bohner.”</p><p>He grimaced at that, his scraggly brown beard and mustache just as unkempt as he’d always kept it. He forced a smile.</p><p>“I always regret not taking Greta’s last name.” His face took on a constipated look and Agatha felt a chill cut through her. “I– well– I never got to say I’m sorry for what– I mean.” He let out a pitched chuckle and Agatha couldn’t fucking breathe. “You are so strong. Both of you. I can’t imagine going through what you did.” He didn’t stop talking, her lack of response making him stupid. “I heard you took a sabbatical. I honestly wasn’t sure that was something we could do but,” He winked playfully. “when the Director is your w–”</p><p>“Agent Bohner.”</p><p>She heard Rio’s voice like it was spoken into a tunnel.</p><p>Agatha was staring through his skull. She had dropped wholly and jarringly back into her body sometime during his speech and she was completely lost.</p><p>Bohner turned to Agatha’s left and smiled.</p><p>“Vidal!”</p><p>Agatha felt a hand on her arm and stepped with it as it pulled.</p><p>Wanda ushered her toward the exit of the operations room and Agatha followed like a ghost.</p><p>She wasn’t wholly present for the journey as they took the elevators and walked through a familiar corridor. She didn’t recognize where she was until Wanda was guiding her into Rio’s chair.</p><p>Agatha blinked, breathing erratic, and tried to focus enough that the swelling fear in her skull wouldn’t split her in two.</p><p>Wanda knelt down in front of her and gripped her hands.</p><p>“Agatha, you’re okay.” Wanda’s hands squeezed hers lightly. “Breathe. Breathe. That’s good.”</p><p>Wanda freed a hand and pushed Agatha’s hair over her shoulders. The lack of weight against her cheeks and jaw and temple was freeing.</p><p>Wanda squeezed her hands again.</p><p>“How can I help?”</p><p>The words rang in Agatha’s ears, repeating themselves from a long-forgotten memory. The iron grip around her heart eased as she thought of Rio.</p>

<i>”Harkness.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha glanced up from her mostly packed bag to see a staff member standing in her open door. She glanced to Rio where she was lounging on Agatha’s bed and found her similarly bemused expression.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha set down her freshly folded pants and turned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He seemed mildly irritated and she couldn’t tell if it was at her or unrelated.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“There’s a woman that’s been standing by the gate for over an hour. She won’t give us her name to match against your contact list but she said you’d want to see her.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha drew in a low breath, her body suddenly very cold. Her voice was biting.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I do not want to see anyone.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The man nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We will send her away. She did provide a letter if you’d like to have it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha snatched the outstretched envelope and it crumpled to a ball in her hand. She stared at the doorway long after it was vacated. She stared until Rio stepped in front of her to press it closed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio turned, eyes searching.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha blinked and cleared her throat. The mangled envelope in her fist was jabbing at her palm and she felt as if her world had dwindled down to just her. She felt the talons of her mother digging into her chest, felt the astringent cage of her bitter hatred as tears pressed against her eyes. Even after her success, after her grab at freedom, her mother could still reach her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hands closed around Agatha’s clenched one and she carefully peeled the letter free.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha flinched.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t read it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shook her head as she went to the trash bag in the corner and tore the letter in two. Then again. She dropped it unceremoniously. She returned to stand in front of Agatha, her palms settling on Agatha’s forearms and rubbing softly. She tilted her head to try to catch Agatha’s eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you want to talk?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shook her head and tried to breathe.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hands tightened slightly on her arms to pull her attention.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“How can I help?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nearly wept. Nobody had ever asked her that before. She forced a laugh, an exhale that had been stuck in her chest. She met Rio’s eyes with a barely-concealed plea. She didn’t know if she would be able to answer verbally, didn’t want to have to ask.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio studied her for several moments before something clicked. Her eyes softened momentarily. She nodded toward Agatha’s bed, but when she spoke, it was with anything but softness.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sit down.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s chest jumped, her breath catching at Rio’s tone. She sat at the edge of the mattress and watched Rio lock her door.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When Rio turned, her understanding expression had vacated and a steely authority had replaced it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s skin prickled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We’re meant to be—“</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her name was a command and Agatha’s muscles relaxed at the curt interruption. She looked up as Rio came to stand over her. She waited, her body thrumming, sinking past the nuclear threat that Agatha’s mother always seemed to pose.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s fingers touched the bottom of Agatha’s chin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Unless it is my name, I do not want to hear a word from you. Do you understand?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded, taking in every facet of Rio’s countenance.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked imperious. Exalted. She held Agatha’s gaze as her fingers brushed into Agatha’s hair. Her voice gentled but the words that followed were still an order.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you need me to stop, tell me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha swallowed, her mind already foggy with want, her stomach clenching in anticipation. She nodded again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio broke her into pieces, had her sweaty and shaking and desperate for release so quickly that Agatha felt disoriented. Rio wore the strap but had yet to use it, using her hands and mouth until Agatha was gasping, nearly in tears.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s skin was streaked with lines and crescents of red from Rio’s nails and teeth, and her breathing was strained just right, Rio’s hand at her throat as she teased through Agatha’s folds.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked starved as she watched Agatha twist and whine beneath her. She withdrew her fingers to Agatha’s dismay.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She pressed her soaked digits against Agatha’s lips, pressed them inside, dragged them against Agatha’s tongue and teeth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s cunt clenched, her hips rolling up into Rio as she closed her mouth over Rio’s fingers and sucked, her tongue sliding around them.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s lips parted, her chest heaving, and her other hand squeezed the sides of Agatha’s throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Good girl.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Aagtha’s eyes nearly rolled into the back of her head and she cried out around Rio’s fingers as they withdrew.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Please.” Agatha rolled her hips again, the lack of friction was becoming an agony. “Rio please.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was kneeling on either side of Agatha’s leg. She and Agatha were entirely bare and Agatha could see the dark lines of tattoos along her shoulders and sides.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha scratched at Rio’s thighs and pulled helplessly at her hips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“<i>Rio.</i>”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio drew in a sharp breath, her icy expression faltering momentarily as she set her wet fingers on Agatha’s stomach.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shuffled her knees until she was standing and she manhandled Agatha, dragging her until her hips were hanging off the bed. She lifted Agatha’s legs until the backs of her thighs rested on Rio’s stomach.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt the stretch in her legs, the air against her core as Rio stepped into her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The silicone slipped between Agatha’s folds, nudged her clit, and Agatha’s fingers twisted in the sheets by her head with a cry.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio aligned the cock and nudged inside, sliding halfway as she grabbed the fronts of Agatha’s thighs for leverage.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When Rio’s hips snapped forward, the cock bottoming out, filling her so thoroughly she nearly screamed, Agatha almost came.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The pace that Rio set was destructive. The fingers on Agatha’s thighs pressed tightly enough to bruise and Agatha lost any sense of her surroundings as Rio fucked into her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She felt her body grow taught, felt her lungs burn, had her head thrown back as her orgasm neared. Right at the precipice, Rio slid out entirely.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha whined, her entire body revolting as she tried to reach down and find the silicone to draw it into her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No no no, Rio—“</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio released her thighs and stepped back. She caught Agatha’s wrist and pushed her legs to the side so she could kneel over her, pressing her hand against the mattress.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s enough.” She leaned down and nipped Agatha’s bottom lip sharply. “You’ll take what I give.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She leaned back and repositioned them, her hands harsh on Agatha’s waist as she turned her onto her side and slid her up so she could kneel over Agatha’s leg. The other, she hooked on her left hip, spreading her open and driving back in with little warning.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wanted something to hold onto, something to break under her hands as the build began anew. She trembled as Rio’s hand pressed against her stomach to keep her in place, the other holding onto her leg.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha cried out at every thrust, her spine tingling, her muscles contracting, and tried to force the orgasm before Rio could take it away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Just as before, as soon as Agatha’s back arched, Rio withdrew.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wasn’t able to form words, her head falling to the side as frustration became aching disappointment. It was too much; she couldn’t take it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s voice sounded smooth and low through the fog.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re doing so well for me, baby.” Rio ran a gentle hand on Agatha’s stomach, her nails trailing lightly as Agatha sucked in breaths, eyes watering. “I know. Shhh, I know. Just a little longer. Can you do that for me?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Somewhere in the haze of everything Agatha was feeling, she recognized that nobody had ever spoken to her like that. Nobody had ever done this to her. Mindless with need as she was, she felt a marrow-deep desire to please Rio. She was asking so nicely, after all.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded, her body slick with sweat, her hair plastered to her face and neck.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nearly cooed, pleased, and Agatha melted into the mattress, compliant as Rio adjusted her fully back onto the bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Good, that’s good.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt her hips lift and her knees hooked over Rio’s shoulders, the slick silicone nudged against her, and she closed her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sunk back in with ease and Agatha could barely breathe at the zipping pleasure, the bubbling need, the slow drag against her front wall on every slow thrust.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Look at me, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha couldn’t. She had her legs locked on Rio’s shoulders and she rolled into the thrusts, trying to speed them up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s fingers closed around her throat. Her voice regained its commanding tone.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Look at me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha did, hazy blue meeting sharp brown, and Rio picked up the pace of her thrusts.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt raw, split open, unprotected as she looked at Rio, watched the sweat drip down her temples and cheeks and nose. Rio looked radiant, her muscular frame driving into Agatha roughly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The build was different this time. It started deep, rolling through Agatha’s back and glutes, arching her body. The crawl toward the peak seemed endless until Agatha was certain she would shatter before reaching the finish.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio lifted her hips slightly, changing the angle, and the curved tip of the cock dragged over and over and over against that perfect spot.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She wasn’t sure when she’d stopped breathing but Rio’s voice sunk into her ears.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Breathe, baby.” The hand on her throat, nowhere near cutting off her oxygen, loosened. Rio tapped lightly on Agatha’s jaw. “Breathe.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha sucked in a gasp and Rio hummed, her hips grinding on her next thrust.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s it.” Rio’s voice was strained, gravely, as she kept the pace. “That’s good, sweetheart.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt a surge of wetness between her thighs as her orgasm cracked through her, driving up up up up as Rio kept the rhythm. She was nearly lifted from the bed as her vision whited out. Her body rode the high longer than it ever had before and Agatha sobbed as she reached for Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>A hand clasped around hers tightly as she became down, her hips lowering. She locked her legs around Rio’s waist and spoke wetly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t— just– stay for a second.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio carefully leaned over her and settled her body against Agatha’s, the connection slick as their sweaty skin slid together. Rio pressed a kiss against Agatha’s temple and jaw. She panted against Agatha’s throat, both of them melding together over the next several minutes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stayed, Rio buried deep inside her, until the patch of wet sheets beneath her became uncomfortable. She released her hold and Rio pushed up, carefully, slowly slipping out of her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her disposition had shifted entirely, her eyes soft as she pushed the strap down her hips and kicked it to the floor. She settled onto Agatha’s side and murmured against her ear.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Come here.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha did. She sank against Rio’s chest and felt tears track down her face. All she felt was relief.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio kissed her forehead and held her.</i>
</p><p>Agatha gripped the leather arms of Rio’s chair and closed her eyes. She remembered the many ways Rio had found to ground her. The firm touches, the control, the eventual softness. She felt her heartbeat begin to settle in her chest. A rare blaze of embarrassment coursed through her as the reality of the situation set in.</p><p>She blinked and met Wanda’s searching eyes.</p><p>“Fuck.” She pressed a hand against her temple. “Jesus, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Wanda shook her head.</p><p>“It’s fine, Agatha.” She answered Agatha’s question before it was asked. “Nobody outside of a few members of our team saw anything more than the two of us walking out, okay?”</p><p>Agatha pushed her hair out of her face and sighed.</p><p>“I feel so out of control.”</p><p>Wanda smiled.</p><p>“You have a lot of people to hold onto until you feel steady.” She stood and leaned against Rio’s desk. “In the past, when we worked together, you used to dive in deeper when you felt out of sorts. Is that what you want now?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t voice the truth. Didn’t add that she would dive in knowing she had to make it to the end of the day where Rio could ease her down.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“Yes.” Standing, Agatha took a deep breath and shook her head. She let out a rueful chuckle. “I know that it’s supposed to be good,” She motioned vaguely at herself. “But the past few months have felt longer and harder than the past five years.” She sighed. “I’m so tired, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, hand placed in comfort on Agatha’s arm.</p><p>“I know.” She squeezed. “I’m proud of you for pushing through it.”</p><p>Agatha looked for the first time, her eyes falling to Rio’s desk as she tried to regulate the emotions coursing through her. She stilled.</p><p>There were two photographs that hadn’t been there, at least not visible, on Agatha’s last visit. One was Nicky. His pretty blue eyes and forest of brown curls were stark against his pale cheeks. He was wearing a bucket hat that was too big for his head, the brim of it hanging over his eyebrows and the back of it resting against his neck. He had on a full khaki outfit and was holding his stuffed rabbit in his hands. Agatha’s fingers reached out to brush against the glass, her heart stuttering. Her eyes turned to a second one and her breath caught.</p><p>It was a photo she didn’t recognize.</p><p>It was of all three of them. Rio and Agatha were looking down, Nicky between them as they walked through the park. Agatha couldn’t decide where to focus her attention; they looked so young, so excited, so proud. She remembered how in awe they’d been when he’d started walking. They’d let him walk whenever he asked, even if it meant they showed up late to everything for the few weeks it took for the novelty to wear off.</p><p>Wanda leaned her shoulder against Agatha’s.</p><p>“I found it on my phone a few years ago. I don’t even remember the specifics of the day. Where we were headed or if Vis was even with us.”</p><p>Agatha waited for the eviscerating pain, the empty ache, but it never came. A dull throb had started in her chest but it didn’t build or crash against the cage of her sternum. She looked at Rio's carefree expression, the brilliant smile painted across her face; she was breathtakingly beautiful and Agatha had to shift her focus. She realized as she looked at her own image, that she wasn’t looking at Nicky at all. Her head was tilted down toward him but her eyes were on Rio and filled with an innocent, naive kind of love.</p><p>Agatha swallowed and looked away.</p><p>“Could you send me this photo?”<br/>
__________</p><p>To her endless relief, her return to their operations room was not met with any strange looks. Bohner and Rio were no longer present, the visiting teams were gathered and pouring over the evidence, and her own team had taken up space in the kitchen.</p><p>She knew they’d likely seen or heard something, that they undoubtedly had assumptions and questions, but when William caught her eye, he just smiled. He waved her toward them and Agatha made a pitstop on the way to stoop down and pick up the large box sitting by the door.</p><p>She ignored their looks as she carried the hefty box to the counter and set it on the side. She unplugged the coffee maker, dislodged the fresh pot to set to the side, and swept the machine into the trash to the outcries of her team behind her.</p><p>She didn’t look back as she ripped into the box.</p><p>“William. Bring your tools.”</p><p>He appeared at her side moments later.</p><p>“What tools? I don’t have any tools.”</p><p>Agatha paused in removing the styrofoam to frown at him.</p><p>“What do you constantly have on your desk when you're fiddling with your little statue?”</p><p>William’s cheeks reddened slightly.</p><p>“Oh, those aren’t– well, they are, but not the kind of tools you…” He tilted his head, eyes falling to the box. “probably need.”</p><p>Agatha set the styrofoam aside and tried to dissect whatever the fuck that meant.</p><p>“What kind of tools are they?”</p><p>William reached for the styrofoam and picked at it.</p><p>“For building a Metal Earth model. Specifically, the Tardis.”</p><p>Agatha’s bones grinded at the sound of the styrofoam and she smacked his hand away as she began to unpack the box.</p><p>“I don’t know what any of that means.” He looked like he was going to explain further and Agatha raised her brow. “Don’t be tricked into believing I want to hear more.”</p><p>She lifted the hefty, black machine out and onto the counter and William crowded her space to get a look.</p><p>“Holy shit!” He frowned. “What do you need tools for? I think you just plug it in.”</p><p>Agatha shouldered him to the side and peered into the box. She pulled out two protective bags and huffed.</p><p>“Find me a screwdriver.”</p><p>She opened the instructions and added a “please” just as William spoke an easy “you got it.”</p><p>He left and Wanda took his place, amusement in her voice.</p><p>“This is a way to avoid buying gifts.”</p><p>Agatha flipped through the instructions.</p><p>“Of course it is. I don’t have time to think about what kind of poison to slip into a fifty-dollar shampoo for Jen.”</p><p>William returned like he’d been running and held out a flathead.</p><p>She stared at it for several moments and then looked to Wanda.</p><p>Wanda took the flathead from William’s hand and laughed.</p><p>“I’ll find a Phillips. Thank you, William.”</p><p>By the time Agatha had assembled the final pieces and secured the portafilter holders, she felt as close to okay as she was going to get for the day. Any anxiety remaining had slipped away when minute after minute passed without a comment or question from her team.</p><p>She grabbed a sticky note, scribbled ‘Happy Fucking Holidays’ on it, and slapped it on the machine before walking out of the kitchen without a word.<br/>
_________</p><p>The next several days were a balancing act of brimming regret for the letter that was sure to arrive at Rio’s soon, genuine explorative work and collaboration with the two visiting teams, and a tenuous sense of self as she fluctuated between stable and bitchy depending on who was in her sphere.</p><p>She spent most of her time huddled away in her office and only engaged when she had to. Jen had commandeered control of the samples and body found in Virginia. She spent a significant portion of her time researching the type of blade used to carve into the skin.</p><p>Lilia was working to craft a stronger profile using Agatha’s updated information; she was completely in her element and despite their late coming to the case, was given deferment by the other teams.</p><p>Alice was working through the victims’ heritage to find any connection between them and the languages and symbols carved into the victims.</p><p>The Cincinnati team had brought in a language expert who’d been able to identify Ancient Korean writing along the right shoulder. It had been improperly transcribed, the shapes incorrect, and once studied, the world revealed was ‘death.’</p><p>The discovery only left a single word on the left shoulder undiscovered. It was assumed to be ‘sacrifice,’ but so far they’d had no luck in finding the origin.</p><p>She hadn’t seen Rio since the briefing, and Bohner had given Agatha a wide berth since.</p><p>Now, Friday, Agatha was sitting with William beside her as she looked over the shallow pool of documents from The Moche civilization. They were clearing rapidly through the rather staggering list of civilizations that practiced any form of human sacrifice and Agatha knew they had to be missing something. She’d looked into the Moche previously and had ruled them out due to a lack of a written language.</p><p>William had a notepad, but he seemed to be taking notes on Agatha’s process rather than the information itself.</p><p>“Why are you considering this one if it doesn’t have a language?”</p><p>Agatha chewed on her lower lip as she picked through her current document. She’d gotten the idea to go back through from Rio’s notes that were still tucked under her keyboard.</p><p>
<i>Don’t rule out the languages that have no orthography. Phonetics can be utilized to map sounds to symbols. Due to the killer’s general lack of expertise and willingness to make logical leaps, it’s possible they tried their hand at crafting their own wording.</i>
</p><p>“Because there’s still phonetics. Sounds and their supposed meanings.” She pointed to the particularly gruesome image on the page. “The Moche sacrificed for fertility, their harvests, weather, and various other reasons. In all likelihood, we have more access to documents regarding the civilizations this killer is adopting into his ritual.” She scrolled lower and tried to contain the thrill that shot through her. “Take a look at this. What do you see?”</p><p>William leaned in and Agatha slid back to give him an easier view. He set his notebook on her desk and scribbled a few symbols.</p><p>“The ‘S’ looking symbol. It matches the first unidentified letter pretty closely.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the carved image and looked back at the screen.</p><p>“And?”</p><p>William wrote a few more scratches into his page.</p><p>“The ‘U’. Su?”</p><p>Agatha nodded toward the operations room.</p><p>“I think we may have found our final word. Grab our linguistic friend. She can confirm.”</p><p>William grinned excitedly and hustled from the room as Agatha wrote ‘su= to give or to offer. She looked but could not find any more matching phonetics.</p><p>William returned with the young woman, her face round with thin, wire glasses sitting on the bridge of her nose. She had deep, brown skin and her braids ended at the collar of her sweater vest. She seemed excited as she trailed after William.</p><p>“You’re Agent Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha stood and offered her seat.</p><p>“Yes. We might have something but I don’t have the expertise to be able to take it further.”</p><p>The woman sat and turned to give Agatha a brilliant smile.</p><p>“I’m Dr. Thomas. You can just call me Imara. From what I’ve heard, you’re the reason we’ve almost completed identifying the historical context of these mutilations.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“Director Vidal was imperative in that search.”</p><p>Agatha ignored William as his eyes shifted to study her. He’d been doing that a lot more; the only sign that he’d heard anything of her and Bohner’s conversation.</p><p>Imara nodded.</p><p>“Of course, I’ve worked with her before. She’s rather interested in history if I remember correctly.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to confirm, didn’t want to insist it was far more than interest. She shrugged noncommittally and waited to see whether she’d hit another dead end.</p><p>Imara hummed, the pitch excited.</p><p>“Oh.” She looked down at William’s notes and began to add to them, her eyes flying across the page, her voice reciting like a memorized textbook. “The indigenous languages of the Andes. Quechuan and Aymaran languages were the most prevalent. It is entirely possible the killer borrowed from one of them to develop the rest of his word.”</p><p>She typed rapidly, pulling up several other pages. Agatha stood and watched as Imara scrolled. She finally stopped and she smiled brightly back at Agatha.</p><p>“Bingo. Holy shit– I mean, sorry for my language but holy shit.” She raised her brows. “How did you even get to this without context?”</p><p>Agatha grit her teeth and tried to find a way to merit it to Rio without receiving another odd look from William. She cleared her throat.</p><p>“Director Vidal suggested that the language might not need an orthography.”</p><p>Imara chuckled.</p><p>“I told her she was in the wrong field.”</p><p>Agatha disliked the familiarity and the way it twisted her chest. She looked at the words Imara had written out.</p><p>
<i>ʃu– to give or to offer.<br/>
ŋka– a formalized act or event.<br/>
Hypothetical word: ʃuːŋka– Shunka</i>
</p><p>It matched the word carved into the victims near-perfectly and Agatha thought about Rio’s reaction to the killer inventing their own word in a dead language. Where Imara seemed intrigued, she knew Rio would have a scathing review.</p><p>She forced the thought from her mind as it brought with it a nearly crippling anxiousness.</p><p>Imara stood.</p><p>“Come on. You’ll need to present this to the teams. This will aid in our exploration of the sites, the victims, and the timeline.”</p><p>Agatha did. She kept it short and sweet, her ego fed through every awed look and constipated stare from the Agents she’d beaten to the punch.</p><p>For the remainder of the day, she shifted her attention to the locations each victim was found and continued, as best she could, not to think of the letter that might be sitting in Rio’s mailbox or shoved into her trash can.<br/>
________</p><p>In Agatha’s moments alone, the ones where her sense of self seemed to fracture into distinct identities– one that wanted to run, one that wanted to heal, one, so new and unbidden, that craved something she had forgotten– she would write.</p><p>
<i>Rio,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Dr. Imara Thomas has been working with us on the joint case. She mentioned you, said you’d worked together before, that you would have excelled as a subject expert. I remember when you would study into the late hours of the night before Nicky was born and how excited the material made you. When Nicky came along, you weren’t even mad that he’d wake up at all hours of the night; you’d take him into your arms with your flashcards and a book light and you’d rock him to sleep whispering about urban planning in major cities in America or Iceland’s longest lasting Parliament. I remember being so relieved that somebody else had to hear your notes repeated for hours, that I didn’t have to drag myself out of bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I’d give anything in the world to have either back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When Nicky got his diagnosis, you dropped everything; your classes, your hobbies. You spent hours every single night researching and connecting with doctors and other families that had gone through similar things. You spent so much time understanding the effects of food on our bodies that you could probably pursue a career as a nutritionist if you wanted to. You took everything as it came, fought with your soul to keep our son alive. Believed the stark, horrific truth of things when the doctor gave her final prognosis.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I’m so sorry it took me until recently to understand you in those last months of his life. I was lost in my destructive hope, in my denial, and I let it drown me.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I see you now.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Yours,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha</i>
</p><p>In between work and letters, Agatha spent time with Billy, and to her surprise, now Tommy. They would come by with armfuls of toys and toss them on Agatha’s floor to play. They built tunnels and huts for Scratchy and squealed when he destroyed them instead of running through them.</p><p>Sometimes she would find herself in the living room of the main house with Wanda watching old sitcoms or in the study with Vision getting her ass handed to her in chess.</p><p>She met with Alder and endured her first full conversation about Nicky. That had been a terrible day. One that had her curled in the fetal position on his quilt, sobs wracking her chest as she clung to the fabric.</p><p>Every day that passed drew her closer to the 29th, to the day that she hadn’t made it through sober in five years.</p><p>Friday after work, Agatha mailed her second letter. The petrifying fear had lessened to a pained acceptance. She was determined that, at this one thing, she wouldn’t fail, she wouldn’t cower away.</p><p>She still hadn’t seen Rio, didn’t know how her letter had been received, but she pressed on because, for once, it felt like she might be getting somewhere.<br/>
_______</p><p>Saturday night, while Agatha was lounging on one side of the Maximoff's incredibly comfortable sofa and Wanda and Vision were cuddled into the other, their phones rang.</p><p>Wanda had said a quick goodbye to Vision and Agatha had run to the guesthouse to throw on slacks and a sweater. They’d climbed into Wanda’s car and driven forty minutes to a half-built structure on the edge of Maryland.</p><p>Snow blanketed the ground and reflected the bright reds and blues of the police vehicles cordoning off the area. Personnel and police tape was posted along the perimeter and Wanda and Agatha flashed their badges as they slipped under.</p><p>As they met with the police Lieutenant, getting a quick synopsis of what they’d found inside, Jen and Alice arrived, and Lilia followed only a short two minutes behind.</p><p>Jen was impatient, eyes on the partially constructed building. She was the first to enter the scene when they were given the green light.</p><p>The team stepped carefully around the evidence markers on the ground; numbers denoting large footprints, splatters of blood, and the sickening trail of hair and a chunk of skin leading up to the open construction site.</p><p>It was small, the building the first of many that were supposed to be erected within the next several months. An eventual summer camp for middle schoolers preparing to start high school.</p><p>Agatha carefully stepped onto the cement base, her eyes flickering over the familiar scene. The icy air masked the smell of blood and death only slightly and she felt the pungent scent of it burn through her nose.</p><p>In the same pose as before, with the same carvings, was a body. Only this time, the head had been removed entirely and taken.</p><p>Agatha tugged her gloves onto her hands as Jen squatted close to the body. She was speaking quietly with the analysts on scene, directing them to take specific photos.</p><p>Agatha, no matter how many bodies she’d come across, always felt the uncomfortable churning in her gut when she was forced into close proximity.</p><p>“It’s an alarming change to the killer’s signature.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her eyes passing over the space.</p><p>“This is the second body in a row found in a building under construction.” She tapped her fingers against her thigh and Agatha could tell she was piecing something together. “The linguist uncovered Ancient Korean as the right shoulder carving, right?”</p><p>Wanda nodded.</p><p>“Right. Why?”</p><p>Alice pursed her lips.</p><p>“It could be a loose representation of sacrificing to secure the foundation of a building. That was the believed reason for their sacrifices; to ensure the sturdiness of the foundation for important structures.”</p><p>Lilia huffed softly.</p><p>“I can’t believe this building holds any importance to our killer.” She turned, looked around. “I think he is fully crafting his delusion; creating a dogma or personal ritual.”</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“He?”</p><p>Lilia nodded.</p><p>“All evidence points to a male killer. And the prints outside were quite large. This is not often how the female mind, even the psychopaths, operate.”</p><p>Wanda twisted a finger in the air.</p><p>“Jen, stay here until all samples have been collected. The other field office agents are arriving soon and I want boots on the ground looking for that head.”<br/>
__________</p><p>By the time they arrived at the WFO, there were seventeen miserable, wet, and freezing agents that poured into their operations center. Jen was the only one that hadn’t touched the snow and Agatha had considered pushing her into a drift on the walk back to their cars.</p><p>She ran her hands together and made a beeline for the espresso machine with her team hot on her heels.</p><p>William popped out of their office and met them in the kitchen, sliding through irritated bodies.</p><p>“The images from the scene came through an hour ago.” He glanced around at the unhappy faces and lowered his voice. “I’m assuming you didn’t find the head.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the steaming machine and debated putting her hands near it like a fire.</p><p>“You assume correctly.”</p><p>Lilia was grumpier than Agatha had ever seen her and she scoffed.</p><p>“We searched a ten mile perimeter and found jack-all. I think we could have left that to loca–” She cut herself off and nearly bodied Agatha out of the way as she retrieved her mug. “Move it, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha nearly spilled the burning hot shot of espresso on her hands, a sharp noise of surprise leaving her mouth.</p><p>“Lilia!”</p><p>Lilia was already manhandling the machine for the next pour and she simply grunted.</p><p>William’s eyes widened at Alice and Alice shook her head.</p><p>Jen didn’t have the sense to keep her mouth shut.</p><p>“You won’t get your coffee any faster by breaking the machine.”</p><p>The team went silent.</p><p>Agatha smiled, holding in her laugh with her back to the team as she foamed milk.</p><p>Lilia’s voice rivaled Agatha’s in her most acerbic moments.</p><p>“What was that, Kale? Miss ‘I take two hours to collect samples so I don’t have to put my dainty fucking feet in the snow? Do you have anything else to share?”</p><p>Agatha poured the milk into her cup and hid her amusement behind the rim of the mug on her lips.</p><p>Alice and William had taken a step back and Jen was leaning slightly away from the sinister expression on Lilia’s face.</p><p>Jen held out her hands.</p><p>“Damn, Lilia, okay. Point taken.”</p><p>Lilia stared her down until her espresso had finished pouring. She pointed at Alice.</p><p>“You’re next.” She glowered at Jen. “You’re last. I will set your desk on fire.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes widened as Lilia stalked out of the kitchen and Agatha let out a cackle as soon as she was certain Lilia was out of earshot. Alice’s lips curled into a smile as she took her place in front of the machine.</p><p>William glanced at Agatha.</p><p>“That was almost scarier than you.” Agatha’s face soured immediately and he shook his head. “Nevermind.”<br/>
______</p><p>They spent the rest of Saturday huddled over their computers, everyone seeking threads to point them in the direction of the next possible victim. Alice fleshed out her theory, attempting to connect the scenes of the murders to the civilizations they had identified.</p><p>Jen had returned to the body for the autopsy and sent pages of notes with two sentences underlined. <i>The head was removed after death. I won’t be able to tell until the lab results come back, but I’m wondering if the concoction that has killed the last several victims is the same or if this change in signature goes deeper.</i></p><p>Agatha worked with Will and Lilia, the three of them pouring through the history of the named civilizations to see if there was anything regarding beheading. Despite their efforts, there was no connection directly related.</p><p>They’d commandeered a table in the corner and the room was filled with murmurs of quiet conversation as the dozen guest agents worked around them.</p><p>Will frowned.</p><p>“What if it’s a ‘new’ civ?”</p><p>He put air quotes around the word ‘new.’</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, head tilting.</p><p>“What are you thinking?”</p><p>William drummed his fingers on the table.</p><p>“What if he’s adding civilizations as he kills?”</p><p>Lilia shook her head.</p><p>“That wouldn’t align with the pattern. He’s put the same carvings on every victim. This new one had the same carvings; just without the head.”</p><p>Agatha hummed.</p><p>“How often do serial killers adjust their signatures?”</p><p>Lilia tilted her head back and forth.</p><p>“Almost never. Their MOs have a tendency to change. Usually a way to avoid detection if they’re not the attention-seeking type. Sometimes it's as simple as a learning curve or a change to environment or psychological state. But the signature is often a compulsion. It’s often deeply rooted to the killer’s psyche and motivations.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her screen for several moments, her mind thumbing through the possibilities. She looked to Will.</p><p>“Still pursue it. See if anything matches so closely that it can’t be ignored.” She turned her attention to Lilia. “It’s rare but it has happened, right? A signature change?”</p><p>Lilia nodded.</p><p>“In a few cases. Fantasies evolve, boredom can set in, they can adopt new symbols. It’s not impossible, especially with the killer’s flexibility in combining the sacrificial elements of half-a-dozen civilizations. The only connection is in the sacrifice itself. Not the reason or the culture or the time period.” She nodded. “It’s definitely worth considering.”<br/>
__________</p><p>Near the end of the day, the Cincinnati team had been able to identify correlation between the victims and their connection to the ancient civilizations. They requested samples to be taken, for the DNA of each victim to be checked for specific genetic markers.</p><p>Alice had joined them to show her slowly-stabilizing theory regarding the locations of the deaths and they’d closed out with a significant amount of new data to explore the next day.</p><p>As they were packing up, bone-tired and grumpy, William piped up.</p><p>“There’s a Trivia night. At a bar nearby.” He looked nervous. “I’m meeting Eddy there now if anyone wants to join?”</p><p>Agatha’s first instinct was to say no, to go home and bury herself in her bed until she had to wake up and likely return to the office first thing in the morning. Instead, she let his nervousness sway her.</p><p>“I could do with a drink.”</p><p>Alice shrugged.</p><p>“Sure. Why not.”</p><p>Lilia nodded, lips pursed.</p><p>“I would like to forget this day. I still feel the cold in my bones.”</p><p>Jen, who’d rejoined them after a day staring at the cadaver and their many samples, hesitantly agreed.</p><p>“I’ll come too as long as Lilia doesn’t throw me from the bar when I’m trying to get a drink.”</p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes, her prior agitation having seeped away. She patted Jen’s arm.</p><p>“Why don’t we just let that go? Hmm?”</p><p>Jen scoffed, a smile pulling at her lips as she went to her office to return her laptop.</p><p>Agatha shot Wanda a text and did the same.<br/>
__________</p><p>Forty minutes later, they were all gathered tightly together in a booth with William and his boyfriend.</p><p>Agatha liked him. He seemed doting, easygoing. He looked at Will like he was a king and it made her chest ache.</p><p>They idly played trivia, the questions so asinine that the breadth of intelligence at the table far overshot the minutia being asked. William and Eddy were by far their strongest players, their apparently rampant use of social media keeping them in the game.</p><p>They placed a strong sixth and Wanda joined them soon after the ending of the game.</p><p>Agatha was gently buzzed and squished against Will and Alice. She laughed and it didn’t hurt. She smiled and she meant it.</p><p>It was strange, unfamiliar, but she let herself settle into the warmth of it.</p><p>Alice nudged her.</p><p>“I’m going to smoke a dart.”</p><p>Agatha followed easily to the back patio and they took up beside one of the outdoor heaters that barely worked.</p><p>She took the cigarette offered to her and palmed the lighter. The first drag of smoke into her lungs felt like heaven.</p><p>Alice was quiet next to her for several moments but it wasn’t necessarily uncomfortable. They’d half-finished their cigarettes before Alice spoke. Her voice was quiet, unthreatening.</p><p>“You are an incredible agent, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, frowned. She felt a flush of embarrassment and didn’t know what to do with the compliment.</p><p>“You too?”</p><p>Alice chuckled and sat on the edge of the closest table.</p><p>“I’m not fishing for compliments. I’m telling you a truth. You are fucking good at this job.” Alice ashed her cigarette. “Every person on our team knows it. Every agent visiting from Cincinnati and Birmingham too.” She nodded. “I am never going to pry and I do not expect to talk about your history. But I wanted you to know that it doesn’t change, won’t change, how the team sees you. How Will looks up to you.” She put her cigarette out before it was finished, like she was going to give Agatha a few moments to herself. “If you ever do want to talk, nobody, not even Jen, would turn you away.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond as Alice walked back inside. She stared at the frozen ground and let her cigarette burn down until it was searing her skin. She cleared her throat and dropped the butt into the ashtray.</p><p>To her surprise, Alice bumping into her walls, peering over them, didn’t terrify her nearly as much as Bohner’s ill-timed, ill-worded attempt at sympathy. She didn’t feel pitied, didn’t feel weak. Alice hadn’t stayed to see if Agatha would break down or spill her guts; she’d just given her a lifeline, told her to tug if she needed saving.</p><p>She returned to the table and Alice acted like nothing had changed. She slid out, allowed Agatha to squish in next to Will, and continued her conversation with Wanda across the table.</p><p>Will feigned a gag as she reached for her drink.</p><p>“I don’t know how you do that. Cigarettes smell.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and dulled the taste of it with her beer.</p><p>“I hope they ban flavored vapes.”</p><p>William and Eddy gasped, a twin press of hands against their chests. William seemed to remember himself then.</p><p>“Wait…” he frowned. “That in no way affects me actually. I didn’t even know vapes were flavored. How terrible and bad for our youth.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at his horrific attempt at covering up his blunder.</p><p>“Okay. How quickly did you burn through the pink one you just bought?”</p><p>William’s eyes shot wide as Eddy snickered beside him.</p><p>“How!”</p><p>Lilia turned her attention to him from across the table.</p><p>“You work with seasoned FBI agents, William.”</p><p>The table’s attention turned to the conversation, each one naming the moment they saw Will sneak out of the office or step away to vape. Agatha laughed as she told him that she’d seen it fall out of his bag when he’d come to work at the safehouse.</p><p>By the time she and Wanda made it home, it was late, nearing midnight. They’d both been up for nearly twenty-four hours and they were expected for a late-start in the office by noon the next day.</p><p>Still, as Agatha reached her room, she sat down to write.</p><p>
<i>Rio,</i>
</p><p>
<i>I understand what you meant when you said you had so many things that you wanted to tell me. Now, without the option to seek you out, I find myself wishing I could share even the most mundane of experiences. I won’t. I don’t want to waste any time when you might ask me to stop writing to you at any moment, when you might stop reading these. </i>
</p><p>
<i>Instead, I want to tell you that I’m sorry. I know there are thousands of things I could apologize to you for, things that I did so wrong. But I want to focus on the present for just a moment, on the choices I’ve made since returning that grate at my conscience, the ones that sits like tar in my lungs. </i>
</p><p>
<i>You were doing your best to save me, to keep me from ruining my career, and I threw that back in your face in Greece. I never should have touched you with hands meant to harm, meant to cause pain. I know how cruel it was of me to toss aside your clearly set boundaries, to disregard your plea.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I should have seen how much pain you were in, Rio. I should have looked for it. I know exactly where you try to hide it, what it looks like printed on your skin. I’m sorry I didn’t try to understand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>You should know that I did mean it. Even though I didn’t want to, even when it made me mad with rage, I meant it. </i>
</p><p><i>I’m sorry I ever let you believe that I didn’t.</i> </p><p>
<i>Yours,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha</i>
</p><p><br/>
_________</p><p>The next week was grueling. The news had finally picked up on the story and they were making a mess of things. Names were tossed around, incorrect evidence, and a whole lot of fear was incited by the false suggestion that the killer was hunting at random, that there were no leads despite the months law enforcement had been in pursuit.</p><p>Reporters and news vans sat outside the WFO in hopes of catching anyone to speak on the matter.</p><p>On top of the news-drop, they’d also begun receiving dozens of calls, empty leads that drew resources and police to dead ends.</p><p>The team managed it with as much grace as possible, though tempers were short and the pressure was high. They’d snap and snipe at each other for eight to ten hours of the day, but, as soon as they stepped out of the building, they would reset, recuperate, and try again the next day.</p><p>A tradition had been born with that first Trivia night. On Monday, the team had found themselves at another bar, no trivia this time, and they’d spent the night throwing darts and bemoaning their eighth long day in a row with no end in sight. Wanda had told Will he would have to take Wednesday and Thursday off due to his non-salaried position and he had asked her six times if she’d keep him updated on any new findings.<br/>
___</p><p>Thursday, tensions in the operations room boiled over. The three teams had gathered for a briefing, Wanda, LeBlanc, and Rodriguez spearheaded the breakdown, detailing every solid piece of evidence and allowing for the team to toss out their theories.</p><p>Jen stepped forward with results from the lab regarding their newest victim’s bloodwork.</p><p>“Our victim, identified as Rumi Condori, had the similar concoction of embalming substances as the others, but there were trace amounts of MDMA in his system. It is unclear if this was ingested by Condori before or after his capture several days ago.</p><p>She flipped through to further results.</p><p>“So far, the theory that the victims may be chosen due to their heritage is incredibly plausible. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA from our first victim revealed that the individual belongs to haplogroup L, a lineage predominantly associated with Sub-Saharan African ancestry. Our second victim belongs to Y-DNA haplogroup E1b1b, a lineage predominantly associated with North and Northeast Africa. It can also be traced to parts of Europe. This would align with the Ancient Egyptian connection. I believe the results we are still waiting on will replicate this result in some way.”</p><p>Alice spoke up from where she sat beside Agatha.</p><p>“That means our killer has access to genetic testing. Correctly picking these victims by their appearances would have been impossible.”</p><p>One of Cincinnati's team members spoke up.</p><p>“That should narrow our search significantly, shouldn’t it?”</p><p>Alice scoffed, earning Agatha’s appreciation and a warning look from Wanda.</p><p>“Do you know how many people have access to genetic testing in the United States? Anyone can access the testing agencies. Even if we narrow our search to those able to administer <i>and</i> read the tests you’re looking at ten thousand. That doesn’t include the hundreds of thousands of lab technicians that might have learned to interpret the tests.”</p><p>Wanda stepped in before anyone could snap back.</p><p>“It does give us another avenue to pursue.” She looked to LeBlanc. “Do you and your team want to spearhead that search?”</p><p>The Senior Agent nodded, her jaw tight, and Agatha buried her smirk. She spoke up over the din of conversation.</p><p>“William is not here but he proposed a theory I believe considers merit. Especially after the lab results.” She felt the attention of everyone in the room turn to her. “As we’re assuming, there is a pattern of two victims per civilization. That means that our most recent victim is, in fact, outside of our current identified civilizations. I would like to take time to explore this change in signature and believe William might be correct in proposing that a civilization has been added to the mix.”</p><p>There was a period of quiet, then a quiet voice murmured.</p><p>“Great, let’s let the intern make suggestions when we run out of ideas. Fucking Christ.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a sharp smile as she found the man on Birmingham’s team leaning into one of his companions. He noticed her gaze and sat up straighter.</p><p>Agatha raised her brow.</p><p>“Oh no, by all means. Let’s hear from the team that has provided nothing but warm bodies to this investigation. If you’d like to go home, the void you leave behind will not be noticed. I’m sure we could make better use of table space.”</p><p>The man who’d made the comment stood, the others following, only to be confronted by Agent Rodriguez.</p><p>Wanda moved to Agatha and gave her a frustrated head shake as she sent them back to their offices.<br/>

<i>It was an enduring emptiness that on its best days felt like a relief, and on its worst, a tourniquet suffocating the flow of blood to my heart.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Sometimes I would sleep on the couch because I couldn’t look at Nicky's quilt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was the only thing I’d been able to take when I left and even then, it spent months tucked into the recesses of a chest in my room. I was so certain that the moment I faced him, what was left of him, I would shatter and never recover. I was so afraid that the pain of it would render me a husk, a being of skin and blood and nothing else. I know now that I became that anyway. In my avoidance.</i>
</p><p>
<i>In the earliest memories of my departure, I know I lost days, even weeks, to the mindlessness that had overtaken me. Even when I worked with the police, I had simply found a way to package my apathy in a bitter but efficient box so as to be minutely digestible for those around me.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But, in all of it, in every empty moment, every meaningless victory, you were always there.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Yours,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha.</i>
</p><p>______</p><p>Friday, Agatha had decided to work from her office. She was becoming far too irritable and Wanda had requested she avoid starting fights with the other agents.</p><p>Will blasted into their office with the energy of somebody that had not taken a break, but instead spent the entire two days off obsessing over the case.</p><p>He smiled at her.</p><p>“Alice said you put forward my theory. Can we pursue it or was it sidelined?”</p><p>Agatha motioned toward his desk.</p><p>“Pursue away. I can help you once I’m finished reading through our next-of-kin statements.”</p><p>William had set to work with a laser focus, his eyes constantly roving through whatever pages of text he’d been looking for.</p><p>It had taken almost four hours of continuous research before William let out a strangled sound, his eyes blowing wide as he looked at his computer.</p><p>“Agatha!” He waved at her wildly. “Agatha, I found it.”</p><p>She stood to walk to his desk even as he continued flailing.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>“Breathe before you pass out William.”</p><p>She circled his desk and looked down as he began to read the words aloud, entirely defeating the purpose of her moving at all. She rolled her eyes.</p><p>“The Nazca site led to the unearthing of twenty-two human remains that inhabited southern Peru from 100 B.C. to 800 A.D. Four of these human remains were trophy heads; one child and three adults. In an analysis of the hair taken from the child, it was discovered that the victim had ingested a natural psychedelic, mescaline.”</p><p>Agatha whistled, a glimmer of pride sitting in her chest as she took in William’s excited expression. She tilted her head toward the door.</p><p>“Go gloat, kid.”<br/>
________</p><p>As the day neared its end, a bright spot of hope bringing up their moods, their team headed down the elevators with intentions to grab a drink at the nearby bar before going home. Wanda walked with them despite declining the invitation to join.</p><p>Agatha felt good. There was a hollowness, an ache in her that never really seemed to fade, but there was also hope. A glimmer of belief that she might be able to live the rest of her life and feel even small shreds of joy and happiness.</p><p>She was walking beside William as they exited into the brisk evening, Jen and Lilia ahead, Alice and Wanda behind. The bar was close enough to walk and they slowed outside to say their goodbyes.</p><p>Wanda had just reached out to squeeze Agatha’s arm when Agatha’s eyes passed over William’s shoulder.</p><p>Her lungs seized violently as she took in long, gray hair, a weathered face, and the cold hazel eyes of a woman she hadn’t seen or spoken to in nearly ten years. She heard Wanda say something but she suddenly felt like the terrified little girl that used to find the darkest corners of her home to avoid being seen.</p><p>A hand touched her shoulder and Agatha drew in a shaky breath as Evanora Harkness stood from a bench twenty feet away and began a dreadmarch toward her.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what the others were doing, what they were seeing. She felt as if she’d been glued, rooted deeply to the cement. Her hands were numb and her eyes stung from a low, simmering desolation.</p><p>Evanora came to a stop several feet away, her eyes leaving Agatha to look behind her for several moments.</p><p>“When I heard that you had returned to DC, I didn’t believe it.” She looked just as calculated and bitter as she always had. “I would have expected you to come to terms with your decisions. To come home and repent.” Evanora shook her head. “What greater, damning sign can God give than the death of one’s child?” She sighed. “Yet here you stand, returned to your vile job.” She glanced toward the sound of a door slamming open and her face hardened. “To your <i>wife</i>. If God had wanted you to have a wife, he would have made you a man, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s arms hung loose at her sides, the barrage of her mother’s warped beliefs bludgeoning at the very fragile scab holding her together. Agatha couldn’t see through the tears she had no ability to control, couldn’t think past the hate, the disgust, the harsh, ugly words.</p><p>Evanora put on the face of a disappointed mother, the face of hatred that had been Agatha’s norm for so long.</p><p>“God, in all his mercy, delivered that boy from evil. He is lucky he died before he came to recognize that he’d been born into the claws of a sexual deviant, a devil.” Spit flew from her mouth, her eyes black with hate. “He was an abomination.”</p><p>Agatha flinched back and she felt the surge of bodies as multiple members of her team stepped around her. She saw a dark figure nearly collide with her mother, heard the echo of a smack, and Evanora’s form stumbled. Wanda, Alice, and William had halted their momentum and Agatha blinked her tears from her eyes.</p><p>Holding up the surprisingly quiet, wobbly form of Agatha’s mother with a fist in her collar, was Rio.</p><p>Agatha stared, her heart thundering in her chest as Rio’s rigid form stood before Evanora and spoke so quietly that she couldn’t make out the words.</p><p>Evanora’s face, a vibrant, splotchy red on her right side, darkened, then blanched, her eyes widening in fear. She didn’t struggle against Rio’s hand curled into the collar of her shirt and her eyes fell from Agatha sharply, aimed toward the ground.</p><p>Rio spoke for some time, never releasing her grip, and Agatha could do nothing but stare as her mother’s expression folded in on itself. She didn’t look at Agatha again; not even as Rio released her.</p><p>Evanora turned sharply and stormed away without another word.</p><p>Rio watched, her shoulders tight, until Evanora was entirely out of sight.</p><p>The collective tension in the group did not lessen as Agatha tried to search for the many bandages Alder had provided her with to patch up her wounds when they were torn open. But there was too much blood, too much pain, and she lowered her gaze to the ground with a defeated gasp.</p><p>She could feel the hesitance, the shock from her companions. She wondered if her mother’s words had rang true for any of them. If they saw her as evil, as villainous.</p><p>Sleek, leather shoes appeared in her vision and soft fingers gripped her chin, lifted her face.</p><p>Rio had tears in her eyes as she looked at Agatha with such fierce determination that Agatha’s world simply stopped.</p><p>“You are <i>good</i>, Agatha.” She swallowed, her voice hoarse. “And, however short our time with him, our son was a gift.”</p><p>Rio let her go and turned as Wanda gently gripped her arm.</p><p>“We should get ahead of this.”</p><p>Rio drew in a slow breath. She kept her eyes forward.</p><p>“She won’t press charges. And she won’t be returning.”</p><p>She walked away without looking back.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of a terrible thing, a dreaded possibility, a worst case scenario, Agatha found herself suffocated in the kind of love she hadn’t allowed herself to feel for nearly six years. </p><p>
<i>”You are good, Agatha."</i>
</p><p>Rio’s words shredded through the vitriol of her mother’s with so much ease that she was reminded, once again, how deeply, how intimately, Rio knew her.</p><p>She stared after her, watched Rio’s rigid form stride toward the parking garage with her hands curled into fists. She wanted nothing more than to chase after her. She wanted to cling to the briefest taste of comfort and forget that her mother existed, forget that Rio’s touch was only ever fleeting because of what they had become.</p><p>She looked after her until Wanda stepped into her view, until her arms were wrapping so tightly around Agatha’s shoulders that she could hardly breathe.</p><p>The reality of what her entire team had witnessed, the awareness of being known, nearly brought her into a debilitating panic.</p><p>Jen’s voice rang out over their painful quiet of the team.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, your mother is a cunt.”</p><p>It was like a torrential wave crashing over a forest fire. It didn’t put it out, but it lessened the strength of it, the heat. Agatha let out a surprised laugh, an almost manic sound that rumbled through her chest even as she continued to cry.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t certain if there was a term for the raging complexities, the overload of emotions crashing through her, but she was certain she didn’t want it to occur in public.</p><p>Wanda seemed to be on the same wavelength. She eased back enough to wrap her arm around Agatha’s back before speaking to the team.</p><p>“Enjoy your night. We’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>She felt a hand touch hers, something hard being pressed into it as she was led away. She reached Wanda’s car, an unspoken decision to leave her own, and lifted it to reveal William’s bright pink vape.</p><p>A laugh left her again and she dragged herself into the car and closed the door.<br/>
_________</p><p>William stared at the beer in his hands. It had been placed there by Alice without a word, and none of the others had made any comment about his age or the legality of it. He’d been nursing it in case the action wasn’t repeated. Eddy was at home, ready with boxed wine and a new vape, because William had texted a quick, <i>holy shit bad night talk later wine nic pls</i></p><p>William’s chest hadn’t stopped burning from the moment he’d seen that old, raggedy crone walking toward Agatha. He’d nearly committed a crime, Alice’s hand on his arm the only thing that kept him from clubbing the woman over the head with his backpack.</p><p>He was almost happy he couldn’t fully see Agatha’s face as her <i>mother</i> spewed some of the most bigoted, old-world garbage like it was truth and law and ‘shouldn’t Agatha just be so fucking ashamed.’</p><p>William had heard of his fair share of hatred, of phobia; Eddy had experienced it growing up, but he’d been lucky. His parents were supportive, almost annoyingly so, and he’d had the self-love and confidence to surround himself with like-minded individuals who loved him for his joy and kindness and weirdly specific interests.</p><p>It had given him a bit of a naivety that hadn’t been shrugged off until he’d heard Eddy’s stories. His dismissive approach to ‘if they don’t accept you, leave them’ had nearly been the end of their relationship and likely the biggest fight they’d had. Because how fortunate did one have to be to acquire such a mindset?</p><p>Now, seeing firsthand the hatred that Agatha had faced from her own mother, he felt the stirring of that guilt, the anger that the world wasn’t even close to the place he’d thought it was for his formative years.</p><p>“Will?”</p><p>William glanced up to find three of the women he’d found himself bewitched by now watching him in worry.</p><p>William blinked and leaned back.</p><p>“Sorry. I–” He shook his head. “Did I miss something?”</p><p>Alice smiled softly and tilted her head toward his beer.</p><p>“No, but you’ve decimated the paper around the bottle into scraps and you haven’t spoken in five whole minutes.”</p><p>William frowned.</p><p>The four of them had been nearly silent on the walk there.</p><p>Alice had been the first to head off after Agatha’s departure with Wanda and she’d pulled him along gently. Jen and Lilia had followed.</p><p>They ordered drinks, sat down, and the conversation had been stilted and strange and circular. Lilia had mentioned the stickiness of the scuffed, wooden bar and Jen had said they should have remodeled instead of purchasing one of those fancy pay-from-your-phone jukeboxes.</p><p>Alice had mentioned a few of the bars she would suggest for their next outing and William had left the conversing as he spiraled through wanting to text Agatha and trying not to be sad.</p><p>He dropped his chin into his hand and pushed around the pieces of thin paper he’d shredded off his beer.</p><p>“I feel bad we’ve been trying to figure out Agatha’s whole thing.”</p><p>Any lightness at the table sobered, sombered.</p><p>Alice put her arm around his shoulders.</p><p>“There was no malice there, kid.”</p><p>William shrugged.</p><p>“She was so private. We should have respected that.”</p><p>Lilia finished her drink, something dark with ice that slushed against the glass.</p><p>“This isn’t a good use of your empathy, William. Don’t beat yourself up, don’t get lost in coulda, shoulda, woulda.” She slammed her glass down. “Lets talk about unethical but legal ways to ruin that fucking bitch of a mother’s life.”</p><p>Jen lifted her wine.</p><p>“Here, here.”</p><p>William’s lips twitched into a smile as he took another sip of his beer.</p><p>“What would that even look like?”</p><p>Alice shrugged.</p><p>“Mildly unethical: interfering with employment, casual public disruptions, disruptive mail delivery, informal character assassination.” She raised her brow suggestively. “If we want to go to prison: fabricating evidence, entrapment, threats.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled.</p><p>“I don’t think we need to worry about it. It looked and sounded like the Director has something up her sleeve.”</p><p>William leaned in.</p><p>“You think? What if she just threatened her?”</p><p>Lilia shook her head.</p><p>“That’s not what that looked like to me. The bitch had committed to disrupting Agatha as much as possible. That was planned, likely a repeated action. Show up unannounced, deride, humiliate, put pressure on the wounds she likely created in Agatha herself. She’s done that before– I don’t want to think of how many times– and whatever the Director said to her was enough to break that momentum. If it had been as simple as a threat, I can’t imagine her mother would be affected. That would be ammunition in her pocket.” Lilia looked impressed. “She has something on her. Something good.”</p><p>William spun the bottom of his beer against the wooden table.</p><p>“It sucks to be helpless. I wish I had said something too. It’s not my place but I wish I had.”</p><p>Lilia smiled at him.</p><p>“You’ve done so much for Agatha, young man. Don’t for a second think that Wanda’s original placement of you in her office was not fully intentional. You were the only person Harkness could tolerate for the first several weeks.”</p><p>William’s brow furrowed.</p><p>“She didn’t even use my name until we were in Athens.”</p><p>Alice chuckled.</p><p>“Agatha is one of the smartest people in any room. You think she didn’t know who she could disrespect and to what level? She might not have said your name but she let you create a veritable forest on her side of the office. She let you sit in her safehouse and work with her. You think if Jen had shown up at her door she wouldn’t have lit her on fire?”</p><p>Jen’s mouth dropped open.</p><p>“Okay, rude.”</p><p>Lilia raised her brow.</p><p>“You would have deserved it. Nobody else sniped at her like you did.”</p><p>Jen’s face fell slightly.</p><p>“Yeah.” She shook her head, grimaced. “No, yeah, you’re right. Jesus, I really fucking put my foot in my mouth.”</p><p>Alice interrupted, arm slightly out to stem the conversation.</p><p>“Listen, my point is, Agatha liked you. She listened to you. The rest of us, no offense, had proved ourselves, our skills. Sure, Jen and her loathed one another, but Jen is <i>the best</i> at what she does. The same with the rest of us. Our competence earned us a general level of respect that included the use of our actual names and a willingness to accept our insight.” Alice gripped William’s shoulder. “You’re kind of hard to dislike, Will. Even for somebody who, apparently having every right to, did not like a lot of people.”</p><p>William blew out a breath.</p><p>“What are we supposed to do now? I just– she lost her son? How do you recover from that? And her wife? Who is now her boss? Every way I can think of to help her, I know she’ll hate.”</p><p>Alice gave a half-smile.</p><p>“You’ve done an excellent job meeting Agatha where she’s at. You had more patience than god in those early days.” She took a long drag of her beer. “You keep doing it. We all show her that nothing has changed. You continue to pester and annoy her.” She talked over his rebuttal. “Jen continues to be an asshole, just maybe without the digs into her past.” Alice shrugged. “This doesn’t change her status on our team or her place in our lives. We have to show her that.”</p><p>Lilia nodded and pointed at Alice.</p><p>“Exactly. If we try to pursue this or ask too many questions, she’s going to handle that very, very poorly.”</p><p>William chuckled slightly.</p><p>“Okay, yeah, an Agatha crashout seems like a catastrophic level of danger.” He finished his beer. “I guess this ends our background investigation.”</p><p>Jen looked around as Lilia and Alice nodded. She looked affronted.</p><p>“Background investigation? You mean <i>all</i> of you have been looking into this and I wasn’t privy!?”</p><p>Lilia patted her arm patronizingly.</p><p>“There, there, Kale. It wasn’t you, it was the fact that you would use it against Agatha the moment you knew something was going on.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes widened.</p><p>“That’s quite literally ‘me’.”</p><p>Alice nodded.</p><p>“Yeah but we can add you to the group chat now. Since it’s over. If that would make you feel better.”</p><p>Jen gripped the table.</p><p>“There was a group chat?!” She pointed at Lilia. “She was in a group chat!? She sent me a picture of her ankles because she was texting me while in the bathroom. She doesn’t know how to use her phone.”</p><p>Lilia looked mock outraged.</p><p>“Excuse you! Will has been helping me.” Her face shifted into a rather coy look. “Besides, we may not need to close down operations just yet. Just shift our focus.”</p><p>Alice frowned.</p><p>“Meaning?”</p><p>Lilia held out a hand.</p><p>“You’re telling me you didn’t see it?” She paused for emphasis and nobody said anything. She groaned. “Jesus. Let me spell it out, delicately due to the circumstances. Our Director and Agatha were literally married. I don’t think they ever stopped loving each other.”</p><p>William’s eyes widened comically as he stared at Lilia.</p><p>“I thought we had to treat her normally! You want to Parent Trap them?!”</p><p>Lilia waved him off.</p><p>“Don’t be stupid, Will. I think we bide our time, give this a chance to settle. Show support because Agatha deserves to have that. I love that woman even if being close to her is like touching barbed wire. Then we pick our moments.” She narrowed her eyes, hands pressing into the table. “Information access requests? The information we have access to is a bureaucratic nightmare and the Director is the one to give it. Maybe we request a threat assessment if we have a viable reason to search for a mole in the facility. We can offer our team up to give those trainings they’re always asking seasoned agents to give.”</p><p>Jen groaned.</p><p>“I hate those trainings.”</p><p>Lilia waved her off.</p><p>“Everyone does, Jen. Consider it payment for suggesting Agatha’s sabbatical was because she killed somebody.”</p><p>Jen leaned back, hands out.</p><p>“Okay, I’m feeling less included and more attacked.”</p><p>William felt his smile curl up his lips as the three women around him bickered. He knew even the fact that this conversation was happening would enrage Agatha, but the idea of doing <i>something</i> even if it was small and ultimately led to nothing, made him feel a little less helpless.<br/>
___________</p><p>Agatha stared at her hands as they drove. She could see them shaking despite the blasting heat from Wanda’s vehicle. The influx of emotions had reached a peak, had threatened tear through her, and now they had just… vanished.</p><p>She was frighteningly numb. It was different than the apathy from her years away. It was all pressure. Akin getting a cavity filled at the dentist. Unpleasant, like you thought at any moment the drill might hit too deeply.</p><p>The emotions weren’t truly gone. Instead it was wolves waiting behind a closed door, so patient, so knowing. And eventually, soon, she’d have to reopen that door.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes hurt but they were dry, and she finally looked up when the vehicle slowed to a stop.</p><p>She saw they were in the near-empty parking lot of a gym. It was almost entirely dark besides a single light deep inside, the sign showing closed, but Wanda got out of the car confidently. The door to the gym swung open to reveal a woman in shorts and a t-shirt. She looked tired but she smiled at Wanda and held out a small gym bag. They spoke for a few moments before the woman nodded and left in the only other car in the lot.</p><p>Wanda approached Agatha’s side and pulled the door open.</p><p>“Come on.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, eyed the gym, and pursed her lips.</p><p>“I don’t–”</p><p>“Don’t argue, just–” Wanda pulled the door wider. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Agatha listened. She didn’t have the energy to hold her own in an argument.</p><p>Wanda locked her car and led Agatha inside the gym before locking the doors.</p><p>It was relatively small and clearly meant for boxing if the equipment that filled the space were any indication. There were six heavy bags lined up by the furthest wall with a row of speed bags beside them. A ring took up the center of the space and there was a pocket on the right filled with free weights and a few very complicated looking, curved treadmills.</p><p>She turned her attention back to Wanda just in time to have a change of clothes shoved into her hands.</p><p>“Go change.”</p><p>Agatha had already started to turn and look for the bathroom when she grimaced.</p><p>“Wanda–”</p><p>Wanda put a hand on her back.</p><p>“Go.”</p><p>Agatha grumbled as she found the single bathroom in the entire gym. The gym itself smelled exactly like she’d expected. No kind of cleaning would get rid of the sweat that permeated the leather and mats every single day. But the bathroom had a rich, vanilla scent that cut through the haze of it.</p><p>She put the clothes on, wondering how she’d begin to exert herself in this state. Wanda didn’t normally miss, didn’t often reach the wrong conclusions, but Agatha felt like she could collapse from the lack of feeling; like she might actually be able to sleep if she could only lay down.</p><p>She walked out to find Wanda already changed and ripping open the plastic of a pair of brand new boxing gloves. She held them in one hand and a set of wraps in the other as she walked back toward Agatha.</p><p>“Hair up.”</p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda dropped the gloves and gave her a look.</p><p>Agatha put her hair up.</p><p>Without waiting or asking, Wanda took one of Agatha’s hands and began a complicated series of wraps around her wrist, palm, and fingers. She repeated it on Agatha’s other. Both were tight enough to hold in place but not enough to cut off her circulation. The squeeze of them felt good and Agatha clenched her fists a few times.</p><p>Wanda tilted her head toward the heavy bags after she’d picked up the new gloves.</p><p>“Come on.”</p><p>Agatha followed because she really had no other choice. She blinked against the fluorescent lights and trudged at Wanda’s heels until they were standing in front of one. She unstrapped one of the gloves and shoved it on Agatha’s hand before doing so with the other.</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“Wanda…” She looked at the gloves. At least she could no longer see her trembling fingers. “I don’t think I can do this.”</p><p>A uncomfortable look flashed through Wanda’s eyes before she steeled herself.</p><p>“Don’t make this fucking weird but I know you need this and I’m just asking you to listen, not think.”</p><p>Agatha heard the growl of the wolves outside, the pacing of them.</p><p>“Don’t make it weird– what are you talking about?”</p><p>Wanda’s cheeks flushed and she grit her teeth for a moment.</p><p>“Jesus Christ. Just–” She tapped fingers and eventually pulled her phone from her pocket. She grimaced as she turned it around. “If you won’t listen to me, please listen to this. Don’t ask any more questions, just listen.”</p><p>Agatha peered at the message as the wolves began to snarl, the drill began to press too deep.</p><p><i>Get her energy out, Wanda. Don’t let her be alone. She doesn’t want to make decisions when she’s overwhelmed like this. Make them for her.</i> There was another message below that almost made Agatha laugh before the language of it struck her, a fucking bullet through her chest. <i>Please don’t fuck my wife but you should treat this like you’re domming Vision and he’s being a little surly.</i></p><p>My wife. <i>My wife.</i> Agatha vision pitched and she put a gloved hand on the bag to steady herself.</p><p>Wanda tossed her phone on the ground and motioned toward the bag.</p><p>“I can see you freaking out and that’s okay. But I need to you listen to me.” Agatha blinked and she reached for the only thing separating herself from the wolves. Wanda tapped the bag. “One, two.”</p><p>Agatha blinked again and stepped back, arms lifting.</p><p>Wanda’s voice rang out, Agent Maximoff fully present.</p><p>“One, two!”</p><p>Agatha listened, the first jab and the following cross enough to jar her body awake.</p><p>“One, two, three.”</p><p>Agatha listened. Jab, cross, left hook. Her muscles burned to wakefulness.</p><p>“One, two, three, two, five.”</p><p>The simplicity of the numbers sank into Agatha’s bones and she followed the pattern with ease.</p><p>The words “my wife” flashed in her mind and she grimaced, her fist crashing off-target and sending an uncomfortable buzz up her arm.</p><p>“Three, six, three, one, two.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest, wound tight, began to loosen. Her lungs pulsed with the sudden need to function at a high level.</p><p>The next several minutes were a grueling exercise, a mental and physical push toward her limits. She locked into the flow of it, the call of numbers, and the thud of her fists into the bag until she was moving like a machine.</p><p>She stepped through the doors and the wolves came when her lungs were heaving and sweat was pouring down her face. She felt the crash of emotion, the rage and grief and loss. She breathed through the layers of her hatred for her mother, the depth of her love for Rio, the choking hold of her grief for Nicky. Soon the numbers fell away, Wanda’s voice faded into a murmur and then nothing. She could barely hear her own breathing, just the steady slam of her fists on leather. She hit the bag over and over and over. She struck through the sting of sweat and tears in her eyes, through the cramp of the muscles in her hands, through the heave of air barely filling her lungs.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long she lost herself in the exertion before she stumbled, her vision pitching slightly as she leaned into the bag and heaved in oxygen and tried to keep from passing out. It felt like all those times running with Rio, like she’d just pushed herself beyond her measure because winning was more important than not throwing up in the grass.</p><p>Agatha curled over just as a trashcan was set by her head and she heaved six, seven, eight times and nothing came up.</p><p>Wanda’s hand was cold on her overheated back. Agatha clung to the heavy bag and only released when the sound of velcro ripped through the room. Her clammy, stiff hands were freed one at a time.</p><p>Agatha used the wraps on her wrists to wipe her sweat and tears from her cheeks and forehead. She didn’t want to keep standing and so she stopped. She rolled onto her back and starfished on the mat as she continued to drag air into her lungs.</p><p>She felt an icy press of a water bottle against her cheek and leaned into it as Wanda laid out beside her. It took her a moment to gain her bearings, a moment longer to gather the strength to sit up enough to drink. Her arms shook for a different reason than before, her fingers curled too tightly around the plastic.</p><p>She finished the bottle and ignored the nausea that followed as she collapsed back onto the mat.</p><p>She lay in silence, just breathing, her eyes open and staring at the lights until they began to flash behind her eyelids.</p><p>She was almost entirely, utterly emptied out. One thing remained, surefooted and bright in the center of her chest. It wasn’t her mother’s words; those had been scraped from her skull and crushed into the leather of the bag. It wasn’t Nicky. He had nestled into a warm part of her mind, a pocket she had made only for him. Where he could be loved without the agony of loss, where he could be remembered with joy.</p><p>Agatha turned her head to Wanda, found her friend already looking back with worry in her expression. Like she’d done the wrong thing bringing her here. Like she’d done the wrong thing listening to Rio.</p><p>But Rio was never fucking wrong when it came to loving Agatha.</p><p>Agatha drew in a breath and basked in the air conditioning cooling off her overheated skin. She spoke and her throat was raw, her words rasped.</p><p>“Wanda, I love her so much.”</p><p>A brilliant, ground shaking relief flooded Wanda’s face and made the words sink even more sturdy in Agatha’s heart.</p><p>“Of course you fucking do.” She crossed her arms over her eyes, lungs expanding in a weary sigh. “Fucking finally, you stubborn, stupid, fucking oaf.”</p><p>Agatha laughed then, and it hurt nearly as much as it comforted her.</p><p>Wanda’s laughter trickled out beside her until both of them were feeding off one another, paired giggles echoing out until Wanda reached her hand over and laced her fingers with Agatha’s despite how damp they were.</p><p>“Are you ready to go home?”</p><p>Agatha sighed and closed her eyes against the overheads.</p><p>“Yeah. Just let me lay here for a little longer. I’ll try to puke again if I stand up.”<br/>
__________</p><p>Agatha pushed through the guesthouse door with exhaustion ringing all the way down to her bones.</p><p>She stared at the finished puzzle on her coffee table that she still hadn’t put away, the chess set sitting on her kitchen table that had seemingly found a permanent home. It was still in the same configuration from her game with Vision, eight moves away from checkmate when she’d resigned.</p><p>She blinked and walked up the stairs to brush her teeth and climb wearily into bed. She dragged the quilt up, reached for the sweatshirt that had embarrassingly not left her side, and pressed it against her face.</p><p>A hard press against her hip drew her hand to her pocket and she laughed softly, withdrawing William’s ugly, pink vape. It looked more machine than anything, blue and green and white lights reading out the status along the side.</p><p>Agatha pressed it to her lips and pulled, the instant, harsh hit of the vapor sending her into a coughing fit immediately. She heaved once and glared at the device for several moments before trying again with less of a drag. It tasted like synthetic cotton candy and the flavor curled at the back of her throat. She breathed out and shook her head, setting the device on her bedside table.</p><p>She sighed, curled further, knees into her chest, and let her mind sink to where it had ached to go since she’d reset.</p><p>The epiphany from the gym now seemed less like news and more like accepting a long-ignored truth.</p><p>She thought about Rio; re-lived the memories of the past months with new eyes and a new heart. She thought about how hard it must have been for Rio to face the woman who’d left her, the woman who hadn’t responded to a single, heart-wrenching, soul-baring letter.</p><p>The guilt was there, it was likely going to stick, gummy in her chest, for a long while. But the shame had eased its pounding to make room for a vicious dedication.</p><p>Rio had destroyed herself to make sure Agatha was okay; to keep her fighting until she could start living. It was time to return the favor as best she could. If that meant Rio was truly done with her, she would accept it even if it ensured the rest of her life would be lived with damning regrets.</p><p>
<i>My wife.</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s heart surged and she pressed her face into the sweatshirt.</p><p>If, by some chance, Rio could trust Agatha to love her again, she was going to pursue that avenue doggedly. No matter the cost.</p><p>Agatha pulled out her phone and blinked at the bright screen. She wanted to put her thoughts down before she became afraid. She would transcribe them in a letter the next day.</p><p>
<i>Rio,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Do you remember how we tried to do the traditional pre-marriage preparations? Both of us getting ready in our own rooms, Wanda basically performing in a track event as she darted between us. I remember it feeling wrong, not being with you, not helping you fix your collar or knot your tie or center your silly little pocket square. And then Wanda came in and she told me you seemed afraid, and I practically raced her back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When I walked into your room, you looked so relieved. You were barefoot in your white suit and I was so overwhelmed by how much I loved you that I cried and ruined my makeup. We had been worried, more so, I think, than we’d told one another, that having no family present would make our ceremony strange or incomplete.</i>
</p><p>
<i>You looked so perfect, not a hair out of place, but I pretended to straighten your cufflinks so I had a reason to touch you. You told me that you were so scared that you’d be a bad partner. You said that you’d never gotten to watch people be in love, that you didn’t know what it was supposed to look like. I laughed then, and you were so mad, but I couldn’t imagine a person better-suited to being my wife.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When I told you why I was laughing, you ruined your makeup too. Wanda was so exasperated. We were late to our own wedding but it didn’t matter because I was marrying my best friend. I don’t think I looked away from you for the rest of the night.</i>
</p><p>
<i>We always had each other. We always saved each other. I miss that so desperately.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Yours,</i>
</p><p><i>Agatha</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>Agatha wasn’t certain what to expect as she walked into the operations room the next morning with Wanda at her side. She could already see Will and Alice sitting in the kitchen with steaming cups of coffee and a newspaper in front of them, likely attempting to complete the crossword.</p><p>She tensed as their eyes fell to her, waited for the pity, for the discomfort, but Will’s smile was easy and light as his hand raised in a wave. Alice nodded and went back to the crossword without any kind of lingering look.</p><p>The stone in Agatha’s stomach cracked, began to break apart, and she took a relieved breath as she strode to her office.</p><p>She’d had just enough time to sit down and open her laptop when William strode in carrying an extra coffee. He smiled and set it on her desk in the mug that he’d denoted as hers. It was white with a line-art frog frowning on both sides. He placed it on her desk and moved to his own.</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>“You don’t need to keep getting my coffee, Will.”</p><p>He grinned back, already typing something into his computer.</p><p>“It’s tradition at this point.”</p><p>He didn’t look over or make his curious faces that he’d often turned her way. It was so normal, so aligned with what she’d hoped might happen, and it triggered a suspicious reflex that she tried to tamp down.</p><p>They worked in silence for some time, both going over Jen’s provided test results for the remainder of the victims’ DNA and their connections to the many civilizations being drawn from.</p><p>Will asked questions, Agatha answered, and there was no mention, no hint toward the shameful display outside their place of work.</p><p>Midday, the Cincinnati team had been able to narrow their pool of people with access to DNA testing to a few thousand, with warrants out to request access to the labs in all three states the killer had been active within. It felt like a long shot, but they were currently stalled and any avenue had to be explored.</p><p>Agatha decided to align their search with one of her own and she closed their office door as the sky grew darker.</p><p>“William, we’re going to take on a rather significant task. Do you have access to NCIC?” He frowned and she clarified. “National Crime Information Center.”</p><p>“Oh! Yeah, I think so.”</p><p>Agatha jotted down necessary Boolean words and phrases and carried them over to his desk.</p><p>“We’re looking at records. Lilia profiled the killer to be in his late twenties or early thirties due to the rigorous nature of his rituals. We’re looking for records between 1992 and 2015 of a kid or teen reported committing strange or violent acts that were marked as ritualistic or abnormal. Keep the search to the Midwest and East coast.”</p><p>He jotted the additional notes and nodded.</p><p>“If we get a small enough list, we can compare it to what Cinci is doing.”</p><p>Agatha returned to her desk.</p><p>“Exactly. We can also pinpoint whether there is any work that would give our killer such controlled hands. Surgeon, vet, carpenter, electrician, jeweler, artist, watchmaker.” She twisted her hand around. “You get it.” She pulled up NIBRS for her own search. “If we can find any viable candidates, our list is going to be much shorter than Cincinnati’s.”<br/>
__________</p><p>By day four, two things were apparent: one, Will had gotten a true taste of the enduring, dreary nature of certain cases; when there were few leads and the thousands of options still on the table, no matter how likely to be benign, had to be explored. If the MO stayed the same, the pattern of a kill every two weeks, they had until Saturday night to locate a suspect before he killed again.</p><p>Birmingham’s team was looking into newly reported missing persons and putting in a heavy workload of follow-up and ancestry tracking. The air was heavy, tense, everyone in the room feeling the strain as the weekend approached.</p><p>Two, everyone was being too normal with Agatha. It sat in the back of her mind, gnawing at her as she poured over hundreds of reports that ranged from mild to genuinely disturbing.</p><p>She’d even roped Alice into working through the State-Level Incident Reporting Systems; starting with Alabama and moving through the surrounding states in a spiral.</p><p>Will had a list of six names, Agatha had nine, and Alice had already pulled four. None of them had searched past 2004.</p><p>Will sat at his desk with his cheek in his hand as he poured through the reports on his screen. He looked a little green, his introduction to the genuinely abysmal, horrific events that occurred to and were committed by children being a rather hard pill for him to swallow.</p><p>He looked over at her early on Wednesday and sighed.</p><p>“This job doesn’t really allow you to have misconceptions about the world.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, meeting his eyes. He looked like he’d picked up a rather heavy burden and her chest squeezed.</p><p>“No. No it really doesn’t.” She leaned back and gave him her full attention. “You learn about the twisted, corrupted side of humanity. We do what we can to mitigate it, to lessen the impact, but we lose far more than we win. Often, the tragedies have already occurred before we’re called on the scene. It’s rare we get to stop them.”</p><p>Will’s face pinched slightly, his mouth turning down.</p><p>“The next victim… people have mentioned it only in the briefings. They said it might be a kid.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched and she nodded.</p><p>“It’s suspected. The research on the Nazca is incredibly light. The study that found traces of a hallucinogenic in the trophy head of the child was made such a focal point of the papers. Lilia is concerned it will be an undeniable target for our killer.”</p><p>William’s eyes watered slightly.</p><p>“That’s so fucked.”</p><p>Agatha stood from her desk and tilted her head.</p><p>“Come on, kid. We’re taking a walk.”</p><p>Agatha led them outside and took them toward the National Law Enforcement Memorial. It was quieter than normal and Agatha waited until they’d reached the path before withdrawing Will’s vape.</p><p>She passed it to him and he gave a bashful smile. It was the first acknowledgement by either of them that anything had even occurred the week prior.</p><p>He stared at the device for a moment.</p><p>“You can keep it if you want, Eddy got me another one.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“No, that is… that is not for me. It tastes like Stevia.”</p><p>William smiled and she felt her chest relax slightly.</p><p>“It does not. You are just too used to eating the ashes of cigarettes to appreciate good flavor.”</p><p>“I’m sure that’s it.” She’d walked through this memorial a hundred times before, sometimes alone, sometimes with Wanda or Rio. It was the closest off-road walk unless she had fifteen minutes to get to Senate park. “You haven’t asked. About my mother, about Rio, about–” She had said his name out loud a handful of times, the act of it like a lodestone pushed up her throat. This one hurt a little less, but it still hurt. “Nicky.”</p><p>William fiddled with the vape in his hands and he glanced at her and thought for several moments, his eyes lifting toward the statues.</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong, I have so many things to say. Like how I nearly kicked your mom when she said all that stuff. It was so evil and untrue and it made me so angry.” He crossed his arms over his stomach. “But obviously there’s a lot of pain there. And I would never want to force you to feel it more than you already do.”</p><p>Agatha felt an unusual softness in her chest, an unused piece of her stirring.</p><p>“You’ll make a good Agent, Will. If this is what you choose to pursue. It’s rare to care like that, to have the kind of insights you do.” She pressed her lips together for a moment. “It comes down to a lot of factors, but one you have to be okay with, one that’s non-negotiable: you’ll have to fight for that care. You’ll have to choose it every day because this job tries to rip it out of you with every case and every loss.”</p><p>Will nodded slowly.</p><p>“But I’ll have people like you, like Alice and the team. You guys did it.”</p><p>Agatha smiled briefly.</p><p>“I wouldn’t say all of us. Jen turned into a wretched bitch and she’s the youngest of us.”</p><p>William laughed then, startled, and his head turned toward her.</p><p>“You guys are so similar it’s no wonder you can’t stand one another.”</p><p>Agatha was not feigning the appalled look that took over her face.</p><p>“I take it back. You’re a cruel, insidious child. I hope you drop out.”</p><p>Will’s laughter sounded louder, his eyes bright, and Agatha felt like she’d done something right for once.</p><p>He sobered a bit but the smile remained.</p><p>“I think people deserve to have somebody that cares, somebody that can fight the battles that they can’t. I know I can be good at this job. I think it would be selfish not to try.”</p><p>Agatha slowed and waited to speak until Will was looking at her.</p><p>“You have one life, William, be fucking selfish.”<br/>
_________</p><p>Everyone stayed late Wednesday, and near seven, the worst possible news broke.</p><p>An emergency briefing was called and Rodriguez delivered the blow.</p><p>“We received a report ten minutes ago that Carlos Vargas, aged nine, went missing after school today and has not been seen since. The cameras on the property show a car by the curb that Carlos got into. There was no plate.”</p><p>Agatha’s lungs seized but she forced herself to keep breathing. She looked toward William’s stricken face and her own distress retreated back into a quiet buzz.</p><p>Rodriguez continued.</p><p>“Carlos’ family moved from Arequipa, Peru nearly thirty years ago, but they are proud of their heritage. Their social media is indicative of that, and our killer could easily have made the connection. We tracked the vehicle until it entered a suburban area with dozens of neighborhoods spanning from one another. No vehicle matching this one has been spotted since, but we’ve sent officers to canvas and request access to doorbell footage.”</p><p>Wanda stepped in, her face lined with the severity of the new development.</p><p>“We’ll be working in twelve hour shifts, round the clock, until we have something to work with and our killer is behind bars. Work with your Senior Agent on schedules.”</p><p>Agatha stayed that night. She worked with the entire team past two in the morning, all of them scouring every viable database. They surpassed the reports from 2006, their list dishearteningly long, when Wanda closed her computer and motioned to the team.</p><p>“That’s it for the night.” She cut off any rebuttals before they could start. “Sleep and come back ready to work tomorrow. No earlier than ten.” She looked to Will, voice stern. “Take a day.”<br/>
__________</p><p>Thursday found a sea of agents, several others pulled in from various teams to aid in the slog of reports they’d pulled. Will had not listened to Wanda’s specific request, his expression stubborn even as he flushed under Wanda’s stare. He walked to their office and looked to Agatha.</p><p>“I can’t just sit at home.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, catching Wanda’s eye through the window.</p><p>“I get it, kid. Wanda does too. It’s a legal thing.”</p><p>Will sat behind his desk with a huff.</p><p>“I’ll sign whatever they need me to sign, I’m not leaving.”</p><p>And Agatha couldn’t argue, couldn’t disagree, because she wouldn’t leave either. She’d had a fluctuating pulse of dread in her chest from the moment of the announcement. It hurt, but it hurt like it used to. It was the pain, the fear, of a child afraid, of what they would endure. She didn’t see Nicky’s face flashing back at her, didn’t feel the drag of despair. Wanda had asked her once and accepted Agatha’s affirmation at her word: she was going to stay on the case, she would do everything in her power to ensure that this child returned to his family.</p><p>Near noon, Rio entered the chaotic operations room with all of her authority in tow. Agatha’s heart clawed up her throat but she knew Rio was not here for her despite the direct line toward her office. Sharon fell in line and they stepped in, facing Will.</p><p>Will looked frightened and his eyes shot between them to Agatha.</p><p>Rio set a stack of papers on his desk.</p><p>“For the duration of this case, you will be elevated to contractor status with a consulting designation. Sharon will walk you through the paperwork and has kindly agreed to backdate it to this morning despite your direct disobedience of your Senior Case Officer. Any and all discipline regarding your behavior as an intern will be met out upon your return to such status. Is that understood?”</p><p>Will breathed out a relieved sigh and he nodded, already sliding his computer aside and pushing out his chair for Sharon to take instead. He grabbed a pen and waited for instruction as Sharon’s nasal voice grated through Agatha’s skull.</p><p>She tried not to stare at Rio but it was all she could do. She moved with purpose, with power, the regal lines of her body painting her position to anyone that could see her. Agatha’s heartbeat pounded in her throat and she waited for a look that never came her way. Rio stepped into the operations room without a sideways glance.</p><p>She let out a pained sigh and failed to refocus her attention through the crash of concern, of worry that clattered loudly in her chest. She could tell it wasn’t a dismissal. It was confirmed in the slight drop of Rio’s shoulders as she exited the office, the way her jaw clenched and unclenched, the way her head began to turn, to look back, before she pulled it forward again.</p><p>Agatha watched Rio until she was out of sight, her limbs itching to act, to follow.</p><p>But there were now thirty agents and even more analysts pouring through information as they moved through the list of suspects with brutal efficiency. She could focus on Rio, on what to do, once they’d done their jobs. Rio wouldn’t want it any other way.<br/>
__________</p><p>It was near six on Friday when they broke through. Everyone was exhausted, irritable, but nobody had dropped off in their efforts. They’d completed pulling reports and the team had switched to aiding in the exploration of each suspect.</p><p>It was a gruesome task, delving into the disturbed acts of kids as young as three, but they’d gone from two hundred to fourteen and everyone was holding their breath.</p><p>With the autopsies performed by Jen, they knew they had less than seven hours before the lethal dose of embalming substances was administered to the kidnapped boy, and Agatha tore through report after report with desperation.</p><p>Alice nearly broke their office door when she flung it open and dropped her computer on Agatha’s desk.</p><p>“Bennett Bramwell. Aged thirty. In 2012, Bromwell was caught collecting personal effects from several students at his high school in Gulfport, Mississippi. When asked, he said that he was just looking to obtain mementos to remember them after graduation.” Alice was nearly vibrating as she flipped to the next report. “He was smart, had straight A’s, but there were dozens of reports over his four years of strange, concerning behavior. Due to its lack of funding, they ran through social workers so often that his notes were spotty and unclear.</p><p>“Then, years after his family moved out, the new owners were tearing up the backyard and found eighteen buried animal carcasses. They expected it was a dog, but too many of them were reported to have bracelets or lanyards around their necks. They found two with student IDs shoved between the rib cages.”</p><p>William had already rounded the desk, his eyes on Alice’s screen.</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“This wasn’t a cause for concern?”</p><p>Alice flicked to the next page.</p><p>“Bennett Bromwell was traced to Meridian, Mississippi where they discovered he had been taken on as an apprentice for a taxidermist. They chalked it up to a rather disturbing vocational experiment and closed the book.”</p><p>Jesus Christ. Agatha stood, the surge of adrenaline coursing through her.</p><p>“Anything else?”</p><p>Alice nodded.</p><p>“There was a taxidermy convention in Alabama the week the first body was discovered. From what I can tell, this was the first time Bromwell left the state he was born in. Lilia is updating Wanda, but she said that it was common for a trigger, a catalyst, to cause a sudden change in some serial killers. Two weeks prior to the convention, Bromwell’s last remaining relative, his mother, was found dead. OD’ed on H.”</p><p>Outside the office, Wanda was drawing the attention of every agent, providing the new information, directing the teams to search for signs of Bromwell and look into any properties belonging to him.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and did the same.<br/>
___________</p><p>They had boots on the ground just three hours later, six agency vehicles beelining toward an isolated construction site on the outskirts of DC. They’d accessed his phone records and found communication between Bromwell and another taxidermist he’d met at the convention in Alabama.</p><p>They’d had Lilia and two agents at his place of business within thirty minutes, and ten minutes later had a plausible location.</p><p>Over their comms, Lilia’s voice carried to the two dozen agents in-route.</p><p>
<i>”Tobias Yardley, forty-seven. He met Bennett and said he’d liked his ‘intensity’ for the craft. Yardley invited Bennett to visit and said he had kicked him out of his guest room after two days because he’d nearly destroyed his carpet with, surprise, surprise, a potent combination of embalming fluids. Before Bennett left, Tobias claims he kept asking him if he knew any interesting sites to study animals; wouldn’t leave until Tobias answered. He was given three rather obscure locations. One is a massive hunting blind set up and used by various fields. Another is a small campsite with trails that extend deep into the forest. The third is an abandoned shack that had been used during an environmental study. Apparently it’s been slated for demolition so that a sturdier facility can be put in place.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha was driving, the lights on the vehicle spinning, the siren wailing, as they careened toward the dropped pin at speeds well above the limit.</p><p>There was cross chatter in her ears as information continued to flood in regarding Bennett Bromwell’s history, travel, and any threat he might pose on arrival.</p><p>The thirty-minute drive was completed in twenty-two and Agatha rolled to a stop at the edge of a forest with multiple other law enforcement vehicles already in place. All sirens and lights had been turned off and there were police officers, forest rangers, and paramedics on scene.</p><p>Wanda took control from the moment she stepped from the car. She was first into the treeline with her team and several agents trailing behind her. The rest had been ordered to fan out, keep their distance, and create a perimeter in case Bennett was somehow able to run.</p><p>Everyone had donned tactical gear and NVGs. The moonlight barely cut through the thick tree coverage and the view through her goggles was tinted green and fuzzy-edged. Even the mildest of ambient light was magnified in her narrowed field of view as Agatha’s head remained on a swivel.</p><p>Animals and insects made themselves apparent, darting around them in the brush and above them through the trees.</p><p>Adrenaline, ignited upon Alice’s discovery and fed by the impending confrontation, had Agatha’s skin clammy with a cold sweat. Her hair was pulled back at the base of her neck and her boots and pants were covered in mud and twigs and dead leaves. As they grew closer to the shack, Wanda slowed them. They listened for several moments before she gave the order to split. Agatha led Alice and several agents to the left, Wanda took Jen and the remainder to the right.</p><p>They moved like they were trained to, their footsteps, while not entirely silent, were quiet.</p><p>The small shack came into view and Agatha forced her heartbeat to slow. They couldn’t afford a single mistake. She gave silent commands to the agents behind her and they began to disperse into a semicircle, motioning Alice to follow her to the back windows set along the West side of the building.</p><p>Wanda’s team was approaching the only entrance along the East side of the shack.</p><p>Agatha crept along the muddy, snowy grass and thanked the sharp wind that cut through her clothes and howled loud enough to drown out everything else.</p><p>She knelt underneath the window, her weapon drawn, and turned to the reflective lenses sitting over Alice’s eyes. She tilted her head to the dark window.</p><p>Alice quietly lifted, peering through the dirty window for a short moment before she dropped down.</p><p>She signalled that there was no sign of life.</p><p>Agatha swallowed her fear, pressed out the doubt. This was a perfect location. He’d be here.</p><p>Wanda’s voice sounded like a breath over the comms.</p><p>
<i>”The door is open. There’s a potent odor, chemicals. Be careful.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha and Alice were to wait for a breach by Wanda’s team.</p><p>There was a countdown and then the sounds of a splintering door and shouts as the small shack was invaded and searched. <i>“Clear.” “Clear.” “Clear.”</i></p><p>Agatha felt a sinking in her gut, a spike of alarm from the hairs on her arms. She looked out into the woods as Wanda’s team called out the all-clear.</p><p>She noted several agents tucked into cover, exactly where they were meant to be, their tactical gear and goggles visible against the foliage. Her eyes passed over a distinctly smaller gap between agents and then snapped back. She froze.</p><p>A few half-steps back from the clearing, no gear, was a figure hunkered low and peering at the house.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move, her whisper calm over the lines.</p><p>“Do not react. Our suspect is in the forest. Thirty feet away to the northwest of the cabin. He’s sitting between our lines. Do not engage. Draw away from his position. If we take him now, we have no line on the boy.”</p><p>Affirmatives were called and Agatha watched her seven agents slip from the trees and move forward toward the shack, vacating the space around the crouching figure.</p><p>Lilia’s voice came through next. She was listening in from outside the taxidermist’s place of business.</p><p>
<i>”He’ll be less cautious if he thinks he’s bested you.”</i>
</p><p>Wanda stepped from the shack and put on a show.</p><p>“Get to the fucking roads! He is making a run for it and we’re not letting him get away. I want roadblocks and a chopper in the sky! Let’s move!”</p><p>She drew the remaining agents in the opposite direction of Bennett, giving him a sense of security, a boost to his ego. They would all circle around and trail Agatha and Alice at a distance.</p><p>Both of them remained tucked closely enough to the house that they were between the shrubs that surrounded the shack and the windows; almost entirely out of sight. They waited, watched, and soon the large figure half-stood and began to creep deeper into the forest.</p><p>Agatha drew a breath.</p><p>“Bromwell is moving. We’re trailing at thirty paces.”</p><p>Agatha motioned Alice to the left and took the right, each slipping into the trees and setting a pace to keep Bromwell in their sights.</p><p>It was likely the most harrowing tail she’d ever conducted. Every breath felt too loud, every squish of mud under her boots she expected to be heard despite the whistle of the wind in her ears.</p><p>Bromwell picked up his pace after one hundred feet, his full, hulking form rising from a crouch. He had a large backpack hanging from his shoulders and something black and sharp was gripped tightly in his right hand.</p><p>As they trailed further, Agatha closed the distance. She wasn’t going to risk their suspect getting his hands on the kid. She had narrowed the gap to fifteen feet when a sniffle, a cry, whipped through the wind. Her breath was stripped from her lungs and she clenched her jaw, eyes flickering across the rows of endless trees.</p><p>She finally picked up another figure, this one small and curled on the ground. She spoke low.</p><p>”I see the boy. He’s alive. Closing in.”</p><p>Agatha angled her path to bring her toward the kid, her eyes stuck to the large figure of Bennett a few yards away. She drew to a stop, sucked in a breath, and stepped out of cover between the boy and where Bennett was bent over his pack.</p><p>“Bennett Bromwell! You are under arrest. Drop your weapon and place your hands on your head!”</p><p>Her voice boomed, it cut through the wind and cracked across their suspect’s back.</p><p>He whirled around, no hesitation in his movements as he flung himself toward her, the sharp, glinting weapon raised.</p><p>Alice hit him hard from the side, his form folding as he crumpled to the ground.</p><p>The crash of agents pouring into the clearing filled Agatha’s ears. They surrounded the suspect, two of them falling in at Alice’s side to apprehend their suspect.</p><p>It gave Agatha all the allowance she needed to kneel down and check on the little boy. His face was tracked with tears, his skin muddy and scratched and freezing.</p><p>She ripped off her goggles and knelt beside him, turning on her brightest light so he could see her face. He looked delirious but he was alive and present enough to reach for her with a ragged, heart-wrenching wail.</p><p>Agatha pulled him into her arms and took the coat presented by another agent to wrap around his small frame. He curled against her, tucked his face into her neck, and cried himself into unconsciousness, his small body finally giving out under the relief of being saved.</p>

<p>The aftermath of the case was drawn out over several days. They reunited Carlos with his parents, the pair of them waiting at the WFO upon their return. They were offered many supports, debriefed, and an agent drove them home. The visiting teams were quick to complete their preliminary paperwork and say goodbye, leaving her team to close out the case.</p><p>Bohner, who’d been avoidant since his last attempt, approached Agatha before he departed. He looked cowed, his head angled down so he was looking up at her.</p><p>“Hey, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha looked up from her desk, William’s eyes also flicking toward the door.</p><p>“Bohner.”</p><p>He grimaced.</p><p>“Hi. Yeah, I just wanted to say it was good to see you. I’m glad you’re back with the Bureau.” He shuffled side to side. “I hope we get to work together again sometime.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Thank you, Bohner. Have a safe return trip.”</p><p>He stood for several moments longer before he tapped the doorframe and turned away.</p><p>They’d found and brought in Bennett’s vehicle, a large converted van with a cot in the center row and two filing cabinets drilled into the sides. They found thousands of pages of research, wild, incoherent scribbles and symbols and spliced theories that made Agatha’s head spin. In his seemingly unending manifesto, he referred to himself as Mephisto and held the belief that he had absorbed the souls of his victims upon their death.</p><p>There was a corner of the cargo space with a bolted-in chair and restraints sitting open against the arms and legs. The sight of it had sent a cold chill through Agatha’s body and she’d turned from it to help Jen pick through two plastic tubs. They’d found tools meant to craft what Jen called a Tecpatl, obsidian and wood and carving tools. He had a pair of phones, one personal, one that seemed to be used to connect with only one contact. It was a forensic lab that focused on DNA testing for wildlife conservation.</p><p>The pieces came together rather quickly, succinctly, and Wanda was sending them home on Sunday evening with the order to take a week to themselves.</p><p>The close of the case felt like these cases always did. It had been the throughline of her thoughts for weeks, the consumer of all her time.</p><p>It felt like pulling an all-nighter, like cramming to complete an essay. All that research, all the writing, editing, and revising, until Times New Roman was imprinted behind your eyelids and your panic reached its peak. The moment you clicked submit, you could go home and crash, sleeping deep into the next day and eventually waking up feeling like you got caught in a ten-car pile-up.<br/>
________</p><p>With the sudden influx of free time came an unpleasant weightlessness for Agatha, an aimless surge of clamoring thoughts trying to take advantage of the vacancy. Thoughts of Rio. Of Nicky. Of the encroaching day, the start of the worst part, the worst month, of every year.</p><p>Sunday night, as she tried to sleep, she instead remembered. It wasn’t the memories of Nicky’s last months, but instead, the memories of her last five years of reliving them. The way the life would drain out of her entirely from the end of January until the start of March. She thought of how hard it had been to endure it, liquored and repressed. She thought about how much harder it could be this year, facing down the oncoming month sober and without her shield of apathy.</p><p>There was something else too. Something disquieting. She didn’t know how to engage with the shape of it or the way it sat against her chest and so she looked away.</p><p>She slept poorly, fits of rest that allowed her a few hours of peace, and decided early Monday morning that she would pop into the office and take a look at the cases on their docket.</p><p>When she stepped out of the guesthouse, Agatha found herself face to face with Wanda.</p><p>Wanda had her arms crossed, her brow raised, and she pointed Agatha back inside her home without a word.</p><p>Agatha groaned and retreated into her kitchen, going through the practiced movements of making coffee. She poured herself and Wanda a mug and walked into the living room to sit down as Wanda filled hers with ungodly amounts of sweetness.</p><p>She settled into the cushions and kicked her feet on the table, her fingers clenched tightly around the ceramic as she held it to her lips.</p><p>Wanda joined her a moment later.</p><p>“I know why you want to be at work, but I also can’t have you putting in almost a month without a single break. That isn’t going to make this week any better.”</p><p>Agatha chewed on the inside of her lip and settled lower into the couch. She could talk about all of it: the fear of the pain that was coming, the realizations about Rio… hell, she could talk about the case and Wanda would let her skirt past the meat of it. But she was tired of constantly running away, of turning her back on the things that made her uncomfortable.</p><p>She studied the wood pattern of the coffee table.</p><p>“I know it’ll hurt. But if I’m honest, I’m more afraid that in healing, I’ll forget him somehow.” Agatha trailed off, her eyes watering. “That suddenly he’ll feel so much further away.”</p><p>Wanda smiled softly.</p><p>“What did Alder say about that?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Healing provides a cushion. Like getting shot but you’re wearing kevlar.”</p><p>Wanda smirked.</p><p>“I’m glad she put it in terms you could understand.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly and took a sip of her coffee.</p><p>“It feels wrong. Like I’m betraying him.” She shook her head. “I know. I know that’s not true. But I don’t want to move on from Nicky. I don’t want to forget him.”</p><p>Wanda reached out, placing a comforting hand on her knee.</p><p>“You won’t.” She set her coffee on the table and turned toward Agatha. “When I lost Pietro, it truly felt like my life stopped. I had to tell his friends. I had to tell his wife and I was there when she told their daughter. I didn’t know how to manage and so I threw myself into the preparations for his funeral, for the ceremony being held in his honor. Everyone kept calling him a hero but I didn’t care, I just wanted my brother back.</p><p>“The years passed and, to this day, I still miss him so, so much. I wonder how he’d be to my boys, how he and Vis would have gotten along.” She smiled. “He would have loved you, I think. But missing him and grieving him are not the same.” Wanda squeezed Agatha’s knee. “When the grief eased, I felt the same fear. I felt as if I was moving on too fast or I was disrespecting his memory. But, Agatha, the missing, the remembering, can be so beautiful.”</p><p>Wanda pulled out her phone and searched through it for several moments. She turned it to reveal a photo of Wanda and Pietro as little kids, their eyes bright, their clothes soaked from what looked like a neighborhood pool. Wanda’s smile grew distant.</p><p>“I keep our whole life on my phone, all of our memories. They’re printed in albums for the house too. Pietro is with me every single day and I will never forget who he was, who he continues to be even now.”</p><p>Agatha remembered how different Wanda had seemed when they were paired as agents. She’d been angrier, less amendable. Agatha had liked that version more until she realized where it had come from.</p><p>“And the grief… it just goes away? Just like that?”</p><p>Wanda let out a tired laugh.</p><p>“Oh god, not really. I mean, kevlar vests only protect your vitals, right? Sometimes you get shot in the fucking arm. Sometimes the missing becomes grief again and it takes you to your knees. But it doesn’t last.” Wanda met Agatha’s eyes. “You honor Nicky by living your life, Agatha. I honor Pietro by living mine.”<br/>
__________</p><p>Agatha didn’t sleep well the following nights. Monday night she managed to sneak a few hours in the early morning as the sun was rising.</p><p>She spoke with Alder that day and worked through methods to manage the worst moments. <i>”You can allow yourself to be swept away in the memories or you can choose them. When you notice yourself getting lost in your grief, find a companion memory, one that brings you joy, one that reminds you how beautiful your moments with Nicky were.”</i></p><p>When Agatha was attempting a quick, late breakfast, she found herself leaning weakly against the counter, a sob escaping her lips as a fight with Rio about Nicky’s food slipped past her defenses.</p><p>
<i>”You’re the one who said he shouldn’t eat this shit!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha snatched the plastic grocery sack of s’mores ingredients from Rio’s hand and shoved it in the trash. She was flushed, shaking, and she wanted to scream at the top of her lungs. She might have if Nicky hadn’t just fallen into a fitful sleep minutes before.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio didn’t look up at her as she pulled the grocery bag from the trash.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That was befo–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha snarled, voice low and challenging.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Before what?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s shoulders slumped, her eyes lifting to find Agatha’s for the first time in days. She looked so tired, and Agatha could feel the fight draining from her nearly as quickly as it had sprung up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio didn’t give her an answer. She stared at Agatha and then she turned away, her hands trembling as they withdrew a now-dented box of graham crackers from the grocery bag and set them on the counter.</i>
</p><p>Agatha drew in a pained breath. She remembered how excited Nicky had been when Rio had walked in with a plate of puffed-out marshmallows ready to be sandwiched and devoured. He’d smiled so wide, and Rio had caught the plate when his arms hadn’t been strong enough to hold it up. She remembered how Nicky had made sure both of them ate one, how Agatha had gone through the motions but could hardly taste a thing. She remembered how Rio’s face had crumpled when Nicky fell asleep again soon after.</p><p>Agatha had felt so lost in that moment. Rio so rarely broke down, and Agatha’s solutions from the few times before weren’t on the table anymore. Still, she’d tried to reach for her.</p><p>Rio had flinched out of her range, had taken off and not returned until late in the night.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and tried to reel herself back in. She could smell the burnt toast sitting on the counter, could feel the cold tile under her feet, could hear the trickle of coffee in the pot to her right.</p><p>She sifted painstakingly through her memories, the good ones so hard to reach. Her breathing eased, her tears stemming slightly as she stumbled upon one she’d forgotten.</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s arm was half-extended, intending to place their dry groceries in their cupboard. Instead, she stared at two full shelves of baby food pouches. It was a veritable rainbow of pureed fruits and vegetables and meats and she felt her lips curling up at the sight.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, sweetheart.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio walked in with Nicky against her chest, tucked into a sling that she’d spent a week researching. She’d bought and returned the first one within twelve hours. This one had made it a week. Even with the promised security, she always had one hand settled against Nicky’s back or head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes?” She looked to where Agatha was standing and her face flushed. “Oh.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha raised her brows, her smile threatening to break free.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Is there a reason we needed to buy out every store in a five-mile-radius?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s cheeks were slightly red even as she straightened to seemingly defend her decision.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s– I figured we would need it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha loved her desperately.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“A year-supply of baby food?” She looked at them and laughed. “Apple, Pumpkin, and Carrot. Organic Roots.” She lifted a brow. “We don’t even know what he likes yet.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked startled, like she hadn’t considered that, and she looked past Agatha to the massive assortment. Her ears went pink and she looked down at the top of Nicky’s head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“They say that sometimes babies have to be exposed to something ten to fifteen times before they like it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s heart clenched in adoration. They’d both spent an absurd amount of time pouring through books before and after Nicky had arrived. Rio had never stopped. Agatha walked toward the pair of them with her smile fully brandished and brushed Rio’s hair behind her ear.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do they?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded, stepped closer like she always did anytime Agatha was in her orbit.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Introducing a wide variety of foods early correlates to a greater acceptance of diverse diets.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha carefully leaned over Nicky and pressed a kiss to the corner of Rio’s mouth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Did you memorize that or is it paraphrased?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio rolled her eyes but she looked pleased, her hand on Nicky’s back rubbing softly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ll be waiting for your apology when he’s the least fussy eater in this household.” She lifted a brow at Agatha. “Maybe if you’d had more variety you wouldn’t have such a problem with bananas.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mouth dropped open in offense.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Take that back.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio gently stepped away, a shit–eating grin on her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Careful, you’ll wake him.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha had made her pay for her comment much, much later when Nicky had been put to bed.</p><p>She smiled softly and gained a few minutes of easy breathing to butter her toast before the weight resettled.<br/>
____</p><p>Wanda and the boys came around noon with a wicker basket that Tommy and Billy were carrying together. They set a blanket out on Agatha’s floor and pretended to have a picnic with sandwiches that Vision had made them for lunch. Billy’s idea, Wanda had said.</p><p>Agatha could tell that Billy was trying his hardest <i>not</i> to say something the entire time they ate. He was focused, his face scrunched up, and he kept looking at Agatha for long periods of time before glancing at his mom.</p><p>After they’d finished, Tommy had stood with all the importance of a four year old and told them he’d be ‘doing the dishes.’ Considering they were eating from paper plates, this consisted only of a trip to the trash can.</p><p>Wanda gave her a questioning look and Agatha smiled.</p><p>“Should we play a game?”</p><p>Billy and Tommy had immediately run for the closet to pull down a rather ridiculous game that involved trying to catapult color-designated sheep into a velcro pen. It swallowed a good portion of Tuesday afternoon and Agatha was more than grateful.</p><p>It wasn’t until they had cleaned up and Wanda was ushering them to the door that Billy finally lost the battle with himself.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha saw Wanda’s eyes widen, saw her step toward him, and knew that whatever Billy said would probably hurt. She smiled at him.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>Billy glanced at his mom again and trucked through whatever look she gave him. He looked like he was going to cry and Agatha knelt down in front of him.</p><p>“Mom said not to.”</p><p>Agatha held out her hand and stage whispered.</p><p>“We won’t tell her.”</p><p>He giggled, his face red.</p><p>“She can hear you!”</p><p>Agatha feigned surprise, pressing a hand to her chest in shock when she glanced toward Wanda, and Billy laughed harder.</p><p>Wanda picked up Tommy and chuckled.</p><p>“I’ll be outside when you’re done, Billy.”</p><p>The door opened, closed, and Billy looked back to Agatha. He looked at her like he expected something bad.</p><p>“When you are done being sad, will you come see my Lego tower?”</p><p>Agatha let out a relieved breath, her eyes watering slightly as she reached out and ruffled his hair.</p><p>“Of course I will, Billy.”</p><p>He beamed at her.</p><p>“Okay.” He hugged her tightly and sprinted toward the door, worry entirely evaporated from his face. “Bye Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha watched him leave, smiling, and then promptly felt the amusement divert into sorrow.</p><p>
<i>Agatha wiped quickly at the tears on her cheeks when she heard her door open. She closed her laptop, hiding away the eight tabs on the steps of chemotherapy and its effects on the body, the semi-permanent port they’d place under the skin beneath his collarbone, the organizations they needed to get in contact with.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky walked in with his stuffed bunny in one hand, the other dragging his quilt behind him on the ground.</i>
</p><p>
<i>He looked healthy at first glance. Nobody but her or Rio would have noticed the way he was a little skinnier, the way he moved a little slower. She wondered if they’d missed it for long, if there was a way they could have found it sooner.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky climbed onto the bed and the normal strain, the effort that was required of a three year old, was something Agatha couldn’t bear to see anymore. She reached out and helped him up. He crawled into her lap and set Scratchy on her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why sad, Mama?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha forced a smile, running a hand over Nicky’s hair as a power drill sounded from below.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m not sad, love.” She tickled lightly at his stomach and he giggled. “Are you excited to move downstairs for a little bit? Mommy is making you the coolest bed.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky grinned, his joy the most beautiful thing in the world to her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Nicky’s office.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes, Nicky’s office. Do you want to keep the desk too?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He shrugged his tiny shoulders and Agatha leaned down to kiss his forehead.</i>
</p><p>She remembered how quickly the chemo wrecked him, how much he cried and slept, how hard it was to make him go back over and over and over.</p><p>She pressed her hands into her face and breathed. She searched again. Peeled back the stiff edges of her grief to find something warmer, softer.</p><p>
<i>Agatha stepped through the front door with Wanda at her heels, both of them spouting apologies for their lateness, for the case that had spilled into their normal dinner time. Silence met them, and Agatha frowned, stilling, listening for any sound of Rio or Vision or Nicky.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They walked into the kitchen and saw three covered pans staying warm on the stove, a bottle of red beside four glasses.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda frowned at her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pulled out her phone to call Rio when a loud clack of wood sounded in the backyard.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her and Wanda moved in unison to the back door and twisted it open.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, what–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her sentence cut off. She stared.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Standing in a semi-circle around a pile of large planks that definitely hadn’t been there when Agatha left that morning were Rio, Vision, and Nicky.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They looked comical. Nicky was in a full get-up with a plastic tool belt and hardhat. He had on a plaid shirt and jeans and he looked so adorable Agatha almost missed the fact that he was matching with Rio and Vision.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was in a large flannel that hung off one of her arms, a white t-shirt beneath it. She had on boots and jeans that Agatha was almost positive were hers. Slung on her hips was a very real tool belt. She was only missing the hard hat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vision was the most out of place. It was clear that he’d borrowed a flannel that fit him surprisingly well. It didn’t match the grey slacks or his black dress shoes that were scuffed and dirty from whatever the trio had been doing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>All three pairs of eyes shot up toward Agatha and Wanda, and soon Agatha’s attention was consumed by the excited screech of her son as he wobbled toward her on shaky legs. She picked him up as he reached her and planted kisses all over his face as he giggled. She glanced at his shoes and shot Rio a look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Did you buy him boots?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio smiled wide and pointed down at her Timberlands.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We match!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda walked to Vision and tilted her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“This is quite the look for you, Vis. If I’d known you were so industrial I wouldn’t have hired contractors to fix our kitchen.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vision blushed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Nicky was certain I needed to look the part.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio laughed and motioned toward the pile of wood.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Vis had a guy at his work that bought a shed without checking the parameters of his backyard.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha walked the remaining distance between herself and Rio, Nicky’s arms wrapped around her neck and the plastic helmet lopsided and digging into her chin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh? That explains why it’s in our backyard then.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio pouted toward her and motioned toward the pile again, sadly this time.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It was free.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed, finally divulging Nicky of his hard hat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What a steal.” She placed the hat on her head and it sat tall, too small to settle properly. “Was the plan to build a shed tonight?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky took out his plastic hammer and handed it to her too.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She grinned and stuck it through her belt loops.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Thank you, Nicky.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda leaned against Vision and grinned toward the planks.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“And was Vision a part of that plan or just here for moral support?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vision didn’t look offended as he wrapped his arm around her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I was indeed. Rio had me on snack duty.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio rolled her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We were just moving the planks back. They delivered them an hour ago. No building happening. Obviously we’re going to use it to build a treehouse.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha reached out and tugged at the tool belt around Rio’s hips, a coy smirk pulling at her mouth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“So this was what? For me?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s brows raised, her eyes narrowing at the implication.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Of course not. We had to be safe. Isn’t that right Nicky?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He nodded at her solemnly, his eyes glinting in the porch light.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s right, Mama.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio leaned in and kissed his cheek, then Agatha’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“See, Mama, it’s all for safety.</i>
</p><p>By the time Agatha was crawling into her bed, she was certain she wouldn’t be sleeping unless her body gave out.</p><p>It did not. By the pre-dawn hours of Wednesday, Agatha felt weary and the fear had hardened into a quiet emptiness.</p><p>Agatha sat in the dark of the living room in sweatpants and a ratty t-shirt. Nicky’s quilt was wrapped around her shoulders and her eyes were stinging with tears that had yet to fall. She curled her knees into her chest and stared at a spot on the ground until it became a blur.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long she’d been sitting there. She’d climbed down the steps because the sun seemed unfitting for the slowly increasing wail that clammored sharply in her chest. Now, the blinds were drawn shut and she had an untouched, cold cup of coffee sitting on the wood in front of her.</p><p>The intermittent thoughts of Rio for the past several days became a steady flow, nagging, festering consummation of her mind.</p><p>Wanda was going to visit Rio, to stay with her. She’d promised Agatha she would. But it didn’t feel like enough. Agatha was the one that blew up all of Rio’s progress, that tore down the fragile supports she’d painstakingly built for herself.<br/>
_____</p><p>The tears came around noon. In the same place, with the same cold coffee, Agatha’s mind tripped over the last moments, the final loss of hope, the agonizing reality that a miracle would not happen.</p><p>
<i>Agatha sat beside Nicky’s hospital bed and spoke to the prettiest eyes she’d ever known.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Baby, you’re going to be four next month. That’s so exciting!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky let out a wheezing little laugh, his frail frame tucked under so many blankets.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Old like mama.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed, her hand gentle around his so she didn’t hurt him.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Who are you calling old?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky giggled but it was quiet, distant. He looked up then, and Agatha knew. Nicky’s eyes were cloudy, fading. No child should ever know such exhaustion, such pain.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It hit her like steel against her breastbone, a resounding, breath-stealing crack as reality painted her skull, consumed her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She was going to lose him. He was going to die.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The door opened behind her and Rio took the seat on the other side of the bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha looked at her. She looked at her like she hadn’t looked at her in months.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Staring back was a woman that had known this truth for far, far longer than her.</i>
</p><p>Agatha had been furious. She’d been so, so angry. She remembered thinking that maybe if Rio had believed in Nicky, things would be different. Maybe if Rio hadn’t accepted they would lose their son, there might have been a different outcome.</p><p>Now, Agatha wept. Because looking back, she felt no anger, no blame. She saw Nicky’s other mom carrying the weight of Nicky’s fate and the weight of Agatha’s hope in one. She saw her wife in every single one of Nicky’s last months and she couldn’t breathe for the pain of it.</p><p>Images of Rio’s drawn expression, her bones so much more prominent in her cheeks and her ribs, her distance, the way she had faded from existence except for her moments with Nicky.</p><p>Agatha pressed her hand between her teeth to stem the sobs and held the other against her chest. She cried hard enough, for long enough, that her lungs ached and her face was stinging and splotchy.</p><p>By the times the sobs wracking her had subsided, Agatha felt suffocated. She forced herself to stand and moved toward the porch with the intention of letting the icy wind cool her overheated face.</p><p>She stepped outside and eased onto her swing with the quilt held tight against her body. It had become her lifeline, the one thing that anchored her to the earth, that kept her from floating away.</p><p>She wondered if Rio had anything like that.</p><p>She sat outside for long enough that the relieving cold became sharply uncomfortable.</p><p>She was just mustering the courage to stand when she heard the engine of Wanda’s vehicle.</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched.</p><p>She stood and slowly made her way toward Wanda’s approaching form. Wanda looked like she’d been crying too, and she slowed as she caught sight of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha knew exactly how her trip to Rio’s had gone. She asked anyway.</p><p>“You’re not staying with her?”</p><p>Wanda sighed.</p><p>“She asked to be left alone.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed back the bile that climbed up her throat, the burn in her chest, the blame she aimed at herself.</p><p>“Is she– Why didn’t she–”</p><p>She stopped both questions. There was no point in asking for answers that were loudly screaming in her skull. Rio was not okay. Rio asked to be alone when she couldn’t be seen, when the pain was overwhelming.</p><p>Wanda pulled Agatha into a hug and held her for a long time, her warmth easing the bite from the time she’d spent on the swing.</p><p>Agatha spoke softly, reverently.</p><p>“I have to go.”</p><p>Wanda withdrew, eyes searching Agatha’s, trailing across her face.</p><p>“Are you sure? She might not–”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“I know. I’m not– I just want to leave something for her.”<br/>
_____</p><p>Moving as if on autopilot, Agatha walked past Wanda, pulled the quilt from her shoulders, and folded it several times before climbing into her car. All she could think about was Rio in the house alone. Rio trying to brute-force her way through the day. Rio collapsing in on herself like she did when things became too much. All of it was Rio.</p><p>Agatha set the quilt on the passenger seat and started to drive. The route was easy to slip into, the streets ingrained, etched into her memory. She pulled to a stop outside before the magnitude of what she had done, what she was doing, really crashed over her. Sitting like a ghost, a structure that lived only in her memory, was now glaring at her from her spot on the street.</p><p>Her lungs seized as she looked at the English Cottage style home with its brown brick and its sloping entryway. She’d loved this house, its asymmetry, the dozens of windows that sat across every face of it. Rio had loved it for the trees. They flooded the large yard front to back, gorgeous and unique, the original owner clearly taking great pride in their collection. Red Maple, Eastern Redbud, three large Oak trees, and Rio’s obsession, a Flowering Dogwood that stood proudly on the side of the home with a small pond and bench beside it.</p><p>She stared at the construction, felt herself choking on the emotions that it dragged from the depths of her, from the places she’d buried to stay sane.</p><p>
<i>Agatha stared at the empty space with equal parts trepidation and excitement, her hand resting on her swollen stomach. The hardwood floors were freshly polished, a gorgeous brown that stood out against the pale walls. They’d already decided they would be adding color and the splotches of paint on the walls of what would be their living room showed a wide variety, a distinct indecision.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes were wide as she stared with the keys in her hand, the innocent, brilliant joy of somebody who had never once owned something for herself. She spun in a slow circle and then faced Agatha, her eyes wide.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Holy shit, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha smiled, reached for her, spoke with a gentle teasing in her voice.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You bought this with me, I know you’ve seen it before.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio gripped her hand tightly and pulled her close.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“But it’s ours.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s heart squeezed. It was so shocking to her, so unbelievable, that every single day with Rio, before their tragedy, had seemed to become her new ‘best day’. They had been so deliberate with one another. After their months of undefined fucking, of wanting more than they were brave enough to ask for, they’d found a different pattern.</p><p>They had chosen and acted with intention, loved with breathtaking vulnerability. Moving in together, getting married, deciding to have a child, buying a home. Every single decision they had discussed at long length; over morning coffees and quiet nights in bed and little arguments that either ended in laughter or moments of taken space.</p><p>Agatha had dreamed, Rio had researched and dreamed just a little quieter.</p><p>Agatha scrubbed her raw cheeks and pulled her gaze away. She should leave. Rio hadn’t said anything about the letters, hadn’t written back.</p><p>
<i>My wife.</i>
</p><p>Agatha got out of the car, quilt in tow.</p><p>She could be good and she could be patient. She’d just give Rio an anchor.</p><p>She walked through the iron gates with her heart pounding in her throat. Her mind flooded with remembering as she slowed on the front steps and sucked in a breath. She looked at the familiar rocking chairs and let out a pained cry that was quickly muffled behind her hand.</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s stomach was buzzing with nerves as she waited, almost thirty minutes now, for Rio to get home. She was rocking a bit too aggressively in one of the new chairs she’d found and purchased on a whim. They were old, a little worn, but the wood was a soft brown and she’d found cushions, lavender and sage, that she’d loved too much to worry about their price.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was in charge of their finances after one too many splurges on Agatha’s part: an antique rug that looked just perfect in their sunroom, a set of hand carved bar stools tucked under the window that separated their kitchen from their dining room.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha fiddled with the receipt as she stared toward the road where Rio would appear, fluctuating between staying put and trying to return them before Rio got home.</i>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t said a word about the price. She’d pulled to a stop in their driveway, stared at Agatha with a slow smile curling on her face, and sat right down on her sage cushions to rock beside her.</p><p>Agatha sucked in lungfuls of air to get ahold of herself and blinked. With shaking hands, she stepped onto the porch, set the folded quilt on the faded lavender cushion, and turned away.</p><p>The door opened behind her and Agatha froze on the second step, a cacophony of curses and regret and hope clamoring for her attention.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>She didn’t have to see her to know that Rio was feeling just as destroyed as her. It was in the scratchy, quiet break of her name on Rio’s lips.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her feet, swallowed.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for showing up like this. I don’t know what I was–” She half-turned, looked at the quilt but didn’t dare to look at Rio, could only see the green of her sweatpants, the tan of her slippers. “I wanted to give you–” She sucked in a breath to gain better control of her voice. “You should have his quilt.”</p><p>Rio was quiet for so long Agatha was almost certain she’d left, closed the door, gone inside. But the screen was still propped open, Rio’s bottom half still visible.</p><p>“Do you know how many times I opened this door hoping you’d be right there?”</p><p>Agatha’s chest shook. Her throat closed. She looked. How could she not?</p><p>Rio was wearing a familiar sweater, one Agatha had left in her hurry to distance herself. It sat loose on Rio’s frame, the lettering almost entirely worn from the front. One of her college sweaters she’d gotten in her Sophomore year. Rio’s face was drawn and the dark circles were heavy under her eyes. She looked exhausted, more so than Agatha had seen her since her return. Her eyes were puffy and red rimmed and her cheeks were wet and she looked as much like a ghost as the house.</p><p>Agatha didn’t try to wipe her fresh tears as they fell, didn’t try to hide them.</p><p>“I wish I’d been there. Every time. I wish I had been there when you needed me.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw trembled and she tightened and released it as she stared.</p><p>“You weren’t.”</p><p>“I wasn’t.” Agatha nodded, her heart shattering in her chest at the pain on Rio’s face. She repeated herself quieter. “I wasn’t.” With every ounce of her will, Agatha nodded, took a step back. “I’m so sorry, Rio.” She took another step back. “I’ll– I should–”</p><p>She started to turn and heard a sharp movement, the sound of feet moving closer.</p><p>“Don’t. Agatha, please don’t go again.” Agatha closed her eyes as Rio’s hand touched lightly against her spine and withdrew almost immediately. “Sorry, I– do you want tea? I have some. Or coffee. Can you stay–” Rio cut off, started again, and she sounded so scared and so small. “Just for a moment. Please.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t going to deny her again. She turned and found Rio just a breath away, taller than her by two steps. Rio cleared her throat and moved to the side slightly and Agatha clenched her hands to keep from reaching out. Rio looked toward the quilt and carefully picked it up as she moved back toward the door. She stopped and waited for Agatha like she was afraid she might change her mind.</p><p>Agatha stared into the hallway, the nostalgia of its size and shape and feel digging into her ribs and circling her heart. She walked to the door and stopped outside the glass, trepidation jolting her steps.</p><p>“Is it the same? As before?”</p><p>Rio stopped at her shoulder, quilt held against her chest, and stared with her.</p><p>“I repainted the rooms. And got a new couch.” She paused, then, “And the fridge went out last year so that’s new. I changed the kitchen towels too. But they were getting gross.” Her voice took on a strained, anxious tone. “I had to replace the rug in the sunroom but just because there was an accident. And I–”</p><p>Agatha touched Rio’s forearm, her eyes shifting from the entrance to Rio’s face.</p><p>“It’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t look away. It all felt so new. Nerves and hope and longing and anguish leapt over one another to attempt to reach the forefront of Agatha’s mind, to claim first prize in how she entered this space.</p><p>Rio’s eyes lifted to hers and Agatha let her fingers slide from forearm to wrist to hand. She linked their fingers together and Rio drew in a ragged breath. She stared like she didn’t believe it.</p><p>Agatha tugged slightly, her lips pulling up in a smile as she encouraged Rio to lead the way.</p><p>Agatha’s return to their home was made in the same manner as her first entrance; hand in hand with Rio.</p><p>She felt it like an embrace; the sight and touch and scent of it curling into her lungs and vibrating in her bones as she walked across a plush runner down the front hall. The stairs to her left wrapped upward, the bannister freshly stained, and the foyer held the bench that Nicky had helped them paint right before his third birthday. Rio had found it at a Goodwill, sanded it down, and Agatha had painted it a light blue. Nicky’s contributed incredibly ugly suns and stars and moons that looked like cookies with bites taken out of them.</p><p>Agatha pressed her free hand against the wood and breathed through the urge to sit down. She walked further in, her shoes touching the hardwoods of the living room, eyes drawing along the new and familiar pieces. The couch was off-white, an L-shape with thick cushions and a dozen throw pillows in greens and oranges and whites. There were three throw blankets laid over the couch, two folded, one clearly in use. A massive white and green rug centered the room, stalks of flowers and stems and trees depicted.</p><p>The mantle and shelves in the room were filled with Rio’s dried flowers and trinkets. All of Agatha’s books, her candles, the weird clay pots she’d brought into the home despite Rio’s complaints, were interspersed throughout. The art that hung on the walls was theirs. The only distinct difference was the couch and the literal forest of plants that now grew behind it against the massive window.</p><p>Agatha could not breathe. She squeezed Rio’s hand, hard, and stared at the photos of their family that Rio looked at every day. Her, Nicky, Rio. Nicky. Agatha and Nicky. Just Agatha.</p><p>She stared at that one long enough that Rio stepped in front of her, concern on her face.</p><p>“You’re not breathing.”</p><p>Agatha gasped.</p><p>“Can I sit for a moment?”</p><p>Rio nodded, pulled her to the couch, and to Agatha’s dismay, let her go.</p><p>“I’ll get you tea.”</p><p>She left Agatha to sit down, to take a moment, to take her own moment.</p><p>Agatha sat down on the sofa, sank into the cushion, and dragged the recently used, woven blanket into her lap. It smelled like Rio, the whole house did.</p><p>She looked at the coffee table, at the coasters with little cartoon figures of horror movie villains, at the hand thrown mug she recognized but couldn’t place, at the artbooks that Rio had insisted were needed for guests even though Agatha had never seen a single person crack one open.</p><p>There was a small television on the wall, likely unused, and beneath it was a new record player and dozens of records.</p><p>Agatha tightened her hands on the blanket in her lap and tried to force herself to stop the flood of tears for even a moment. It was making it hard to see and she didn’t want to miss anything.</p><p>Homesickness gummed up her chest and lungs and throat as she stared at the space, listened to Rio moving about in the kitchen, and heard the whistle of a kettle. She was here, but it wasn’t hers anymore. It felt as if an hourglass had been turned over, an impending moment of finality that would arrive sooner than she wanted it. When she’d have to leave again.</p><p>Rio walked back into the room with a mug and Nicky’s quilt still in her arms. She set the mug in front of Agatha and stood there for several long seconds, her eyes flickering to Agatha and to the couch, then to the recliner beside it.</p><p>She sat down a few feet from Agatha and let out a strained breath as she squeezed the quilt to her chest.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>Agatha let out a wet laugh, her eyes falling to Rio.</p><p>“No.” She looked at the wooden frame of the couch, motioned to it. “I like the couch.”</p><p>Rio smiled lightly, then it fell from her face. She looked at the quilt.</p><p>“Why are you here, Agatha?”</p><p>It wasn’t an accusation. There was no bitterness or anger in her words. She asked like she had a desperate hope for the answer.</p><p>Agatha picked up her mug, letting the warmth seep into her palms.</p><p>“I don’t know, I–” Agatha’s teeth pressed together. “No. That’s a lie. I couldn’t stand the idea of you being here alone. Wanda said you asked her to go.”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“It felt like too much this year.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to close the space between them, the two feet felt immeasurably wide, but she kept still.</p><p>“I thought the quilt would help. I wanted you to have it.”</p><p>Rio gazed at the pattern, her cheeks wet.</p><p>“This is all you have of him, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha flinched. It wasn’t meant as an attack, a beratement, but she felt it like a jab. She’d left with a single picture and his quilt that she hadn’t been able to look at half of the time.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fell to her then and they didn’t leave. She studied Agatha, looked through her, and seemed to come to a conclusion.</p><p>“Do you want to…” Rio’s voice broke slightly and she pressed on. “The albums. Do you want to look at them?”</p><p>If she’d been asked that in any moment but this one, she would have said no. The thought of it would have been crippling, unmooring.</p><p>But here, in this place next to Rio, in the home they’d shared, it was all she could think about, all she wanted.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward and opened the cabinet of the coffee table, her hands falling to two leather bound albums that they’d picked out together. The pages were thick and aged, the cover engraved with Nicky’s name and the ages and years they covered.</p><p>They were the same as the one Agatha had purchased for Rio’s flowers.</p><p>Rio set the albums on the coffee table and selected the top with shaking hands. She looked at the space between them and swallowed thickly before sliding closer. A foot. Then two. Until their sides were centimeters apart and Agatha could feel the heat of Rio at her side.</p><p>The album was placed across their laps and Agatha stared at the dedication that had been added beneath the original title: <i>The littlest hero. The keeper of our hearts.</i></p><p>Agatha slid her fingertips over the words, dipped them around the cover, and pulled it open.</p><p>The first page hit her like a truck, twelve baby photos of Nicky swaddled up in different arms, dried petals and stems decorating the page. Agatha in her hospital bed, sweaty and exhausted, Nicky tucked to her chest. Rio looking somehow just as wrecked, standing beside Agatha, eyes on their son like she was witnessing a miracle.</p><p>There was a photo of the first time that Rio held him. She was crying, her smile blinding as Nicky’s tiny hand held onto one of her fingers.</p><p>There was an image of Wanda sitting in a chair at their house, Nicky asleep against her chest as she looked down at him in wonder.</p><p>Vision, sitting on the couch, looking nervous as all hell, Nicky’s face twisted like he was about to cry.</p><p>Agatha in the rocking chair of Nicky’s room looking so pleased and equally as tired.</p><p>Rio standing in the archway before the kitchen, backlit and gorgeous, as she swayed Nicky to sleep.</p><p>Agatha standing between Wanda and Vision, staring at the camera with a smug grin while Wanda and Vis looked at one another awkwardly.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, touched the glossy frame.</p><p>“I think I asked Vision how many kids he wanted.”</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>“More specifically, you asked Vision how many kids he wanted with Wanda.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and felt a burst of joy at the memory.</p><p>“Wanda yelled at me for twenty minutes after he left.”</p><p>“And me. I got in trouble for not censoring the woman who had recently given birth.”</p><p>Agatha carefully turned the page and the impact was nearly identical to the first.</p><p>A dozen more photos. Nicky’s arms and legs spread wide, his onesie white with a print of little animals on it. His bright blue eyes were wide and his nearly bald head had a few wisps of blonde hair. Agatha drew in a breath.</p><p>“I forgot how blonde his hair was in the beginning.” She looked away, to Rio, to take a breath. “You kept calling him Baldy the Glowman.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulder brushed Agatha’s as she shifted.</p><p>“It made you so angry.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened comically.</p><p>“Because that’s a terrible name!”</p><p>Rio met her eyes, her lips curling up.</p><p>“His head literally glowed in the right lighting.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop the smile that mirrored Rio’s and so she looked away, back to the book.</p><p>There were so many different onesies on display, each more absurd than the last. Wanda had decided it was her duty to dress him in the most heavy handed outfits. ‘I have two mommies,’ ‘I love my moms,’ Mommies’ little rascal.’</p><p>Agatha stared at every photo with his eyes open for minutes at a time, touched and traced and breathed through the <i>missing</i> that ached in her chest.</p><p>She hadn’t seen these photos in years, hadn’t even considered them because of how much she’d known it would hurt. But this? It felt like a gentle fist around her heart. It hurt and it warmed her, it reminded her of her joy.</p><p>Rio’s finger pointed toward a photo on the right side. It was Agatha holding Nicky, standing over a massive stack of baby gifts in shock.</p><p>“You were so certain that none of our coworkers were smart enough to get him good gifts. You made me google reviews for everything we opened.”</p><p>Agatha sniffed.</p><p>“I stand by that. Bohner literally sent you home with his figurines from Star Wars.”</p><p>“I don’t think we had to google those to know they were choking hazards.”</p><p>As they continued through the pages, Agatha committed every single photo to memory, branded them in her mind in case she didn’t get to look again for a time. As they continued, her and Rio’s sides, hips, and thighs touched, their hands brushing as they pointed at the pages, and spoke of the memories.</p><p>The agony, the dread of the day, had slipped away for a moment. It sat, waiting on the other side of whatever nook they’d carved themselves into.</p><p>They looked at milestones of Nicky’s first time rolling over, taken while he was wearing one of Wanda’s onesies.</p><p>Rio laughed.</p><p>“Oh god, you actually photoshopped a different outfit on him and Wanda printed the original and replaced it.”</p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p>“I told her she was uninvited from our house for six months.”</p><p>“You upheld it too. Until a month later when you wanted her to babysit because you didn’t trust anyone else.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the most recent page, Nicky sitting amongst an array of toys, eyes wide as he stared at them. You could just barely see Rio’s hands near his back.</p><p>“You were so scared he’d fall. Every time he sat up alone for two weeks you were a foot away, ready to catch him.”</p><p>Rio smiled at the picture.</p><p>“I was a foot away because his separation anxiety was astounding. You couldn’t leave a room without him wailing.”</p><p>Agatha turned the page and laughed.</p><p>It was a photo of Agatha with her head in her hands, Wanda holding up Nicky in her new delivery of baby clothes. There were adorable additions, cute overalls and little shoes and colorful shorts. But she’d also decided that Rio would be okay with getting branded ‘Daddy’ because there were only so many options to choose from. ‘Daddy’s Little Dude,’ ‘Rad like my Dad,’ and Agatha’s most despised, ‘Silly Daddy, Boobs are for Babies’ that was terrible and awful, but made Rio laugh so hard that they’d kept it.</p><p>Nicky always seemed to reach his milestones on hard weeks when they’d run out of clean clothes, when Wanda’s cursed pieces were proudly displayed. The first time he’d stood, Nicky was wearing the boobs are for babies t-shirt, and Agatha had actually cried.</p><p>Nicky’s first word, ‘mama,’ a classic, was said while he wore Wanda’s overalls that said ‘I only cry when ugly people hold me.’</p><p>The first time he walked he was wearing a shirt that said ‘Take me to my Aunt, you peasant’ and Wanda had talked about it for an entire year.</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“I swear, Wanda sold her soul to make sure she ruined every single benchmark.”</p><p>Rio laughed and it struck Agatha that both of them had been laughing. Crying too. But laughing. She wondered how long it had been since either one of them had done that on this day.</p><p>They turned another page, their heads both bent over the images, nearly touching.</p><p>Rio pointed.</p><p>“I loved that sweater. He looked like a mini-adult.”</p><p>Agatha looked at the thin stripes of green and cream, the turtleneck, the ribbed cuffs and hemline.</p><p>“I know you did. Every time he wore it you would ask him when the quarterly report was going to be ready. Or if he knew that it wasn’t appropriate to be so adorable in an office setting. One time you asked him to get you a list of the people that needed to be fired and you said my name should be on it.”</p><p>Rio snickered.</p><p>“I think it was the day you’d vetoed my very smart idea of getting one of those hanging, bouncy swings.”</p><p>“I didn’t veto it! I told you to wait because it could delay his development.”</p><p>Rio huffed and turned to a section dedicated entirely to Nicky’s first birthday. It had been Trolls themed because he’d decided the weird doll he’d found at the park was the only thing he wanted to play with. After they’d secretly thrown it away and bought him one that hadn’t been sourced from the gravel of a parking lot, he hadn’t let it go. Agatha had purchased headbands that mimicked the troll hair, and by the end of the night, only the adults were wearing them.</p><p>They’d invited two kids from Nicky’s daycare that he was obsessed with. A boy named Robin and a girl named Hallie. The three of them had sat in the living room amongst the adults, Wanda and Vision included, and played with an ungodly selection of toys for almost two hours. The few  interruptions that came were for diaper changes, a few tears, and a rather quick interlude to hide a rainbow tower with slides and tubes that carried plastic balls down to the rug. They had begun to fight over it, the toy pulled at, until Rio distracted them with puff snacks and Agatha snuck it into the kitchen.</p><p>In the midst of it all, the adults talked about all the parent things that seemed to take over your life once you had a child.</p><p>Agatha could hardly remember the other two kids now; she remembered their parents even less. They’d been nice people. They’d tried to reach out after Nicky, but she hadn’t been able to speak to anyone that had the privilege, the joy, of watching their children grow older.</p><p>Agatha wanted to turn the page. She didn’t want to dwell on the celebration of him getting closer to his death. She wanted to look at the images outside of time, to forget what each gained centimeter and defined feature meant for him.</p><p>Rio either felt similarly, or she caught on to Agatha’s need. She moved them into the next era without reminiscing.</p><p>They reached a collage of First Holidays, pictures of Nicky in a little sheep costume that had brought Agatha to tears on the day. Now was no different, her eyes flooding at the way it framed his face, the little ears that had hung off his head, the black socks and mittens that covered his hands.</p><p>She let out a shaking breath, her face tight, and Rio’s hand pressed into her back, rubbed gently. She couldn’t stop the way she leaned into her, the way her body fit so well under Rio’s arm.</p><p>Agatha dragged her eyes away from the Halloween costume to their first Christmas photos. They looked tired but happy, both of them sitting on the couch, Nicky between them with a splotchy face, everyone in matching, red Christmas sweaters.</p><p>Rio sighed.</p><p>“It took almost an hour to get one where he wasn’t crying.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, basking in the warmth of Rio against her.</p><p>“We had such a stupid fight.”</p><p>“I know. I got mad and told you to take the photos without me.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“Jesus, and that made me even angrier.”</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>“You about clotheslined me when I stood up to leave.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“It was dumb of you to try to leave our family Christmas photos.”</p><p>Rio’s thumb rubbed soothingly against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“After you took the photo, you called Wanda to come watch Nicky and we got in the car and drove ten minutes away. We sat there and talked for two hours.” Rio’s hand tensed. “You told me that it scared you. Even though I didn’t mean it, you hated that I had tried to walk away instead of working through it.”</p><p>Agatha looked down, her vision blurring slightly as she lost focus.</p><p>“You never did it again. Not like that at least. Sometimes you needed space, sometimes you wanted time to process, but you always told me.”</p><p>Rio’s arm fell slightly back, resting on the cushion instead of Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>“I did though. I did it again. When the problem became too big, I pulled away.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“Rio, I don’t think now is–” Agatha paused, gathering her words. “There is so much to say and I don’t think now is the time to do it.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her arm retracting entirely into her lap.</p><p>The quilt was sitting across both of their legs and their drinks were long-since finished.</p><p>A bolt of fear shot through Agatha and she didn’t stop her instinctive need to reach out. Her hand slipped back into Rio’s. The action was so loaded, so gentle compared to the way they’d treated one another since Agatha’s return. She squeezed softly.</p><p>“I want to talk about it, Rio. I promise. But I want to choose it. I want both of us to choose it instead of me just showing up.”</p><p>Rio relaxed beside her and Agatha had to pull her hand back to be able to return to the album. They fell through memories of Nicky learning to walk, of his Superhero phase that he never had a chance to end. There were photos of Rio with Nicky strapped to her back, on trails and hikes with Wanda. There was a picture of Agatha asleep on the couch, Nicky asleep on her chest, and a book leaned against him.</p><p>There were so many of the three of them fitting perfectly together, and all she wanted to was to forget, for one moment, that she’d lost this.</p><p>The three of them at Wanda and Visions’ wedding, the three of them tucking into a batch of homemade ice cream that had honestly been terrible, the three of them in the backyard as Rio installed a swingset, the three of them on Nicky’s first vacation, sand and ocean at their backs.</p><p>As they neared Nicky’s second birthday, Agatha closed the album. She couldn’t look at it, couldn’t see another year so firmly closed. She set the album on the coffee table and stared at the second one.</p><p>It was obvious that it wasn’t filled, that they’d stopped adding more. The gaps created by the photos cut off halfway through the pages and the sight of it pierced the bubble.</p><p>She stopped Rio’s hand from turning the cover.</p><p>“I can’t do it.” Her throat closed, her nose burned. “I don’t want to reach the end.”</p><p>Rio didn’t press the issue. This thing was fragile, gossamer, there was no telling what would overturn the balance into something they weren’t ready for. She set the album on top of the other and reached for the remote.</p><p>“I put something together a few years ago. A lot of our videos. Do you want to see them?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t seen a video of Nicky in five years. Hadn’t heard his laugh or his voice, hadn’t been able to open the hundreds of videos her and Rio had stored. She stared at the blank screen and nodded.</p><p>Rio must have been watching it before, must have turned it off after realizing somebody had shown up at her house. As soon as the screen flashed to life, Agatha’s lungs seized.</p><p>It was from Wanda and Visions’ wedding. They’d been living together for ages, but they’d put off having the ceremony until work had slowed down for both of them. Nicky was barely one and he was wearing tiny slacks and tiny suspenders over a soft, white shirt. He had on tiny dress shoes and Agatha was walking with him at a snail’s pace. They had a basket of flowers that Nicky was bunching in his fists inside, leaving clumps of petals down the aisle. There were giggles and laughs from the other guests at the display, and Agatha could hear Rio sniffling in the background of the video behind the camera.</p><p>Vision was grinning from ear to ear as he watched, and Agatha recognized some of the faces that came into frame on either side. She’d seen some of them at the house for Christmas this year.</p><p>The scene ended when Agatha and Nicky reached the end of the aisle.</p><p>It cut to the reception, to Rio and Nicky on the dance floor. Nicky was hopping around and holding onto Rio’s hand as they danced.</p><p>It cut to the table, Nicky asleep in Wanda’s arms, his head resting against the detail of her wedding dress as if it was the most comfortable thing in the world.</p><p>Agatha was crying again.</p><p>“I forgot how much he loved her.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer and Agatha watched as it cut again, this time to Rio trying to pull Nicky from Wanda so she could have her first dance. He nearly wailed and Rio’s cheeks were so red from the attention undoubtedly on them.</p><p>The last scene from that night was Agatha carrying Nicky inside, his face slack where it rested on her shoulder.</p><p>Through all of them, Nicky was either silent or music had covered any other sounds.</p><p>The squeal of his laughter as the video changed lacerated Agatha’s heart.</p><p>It was from a trip to the park. Nicky was wearing jean overalls with patches sewn into it. He was running at his top speed, his sneakers kicking up mulch, as Rio darted behind him.</p><p>Agatha pressed a hand over her mouth to contain the sob that ripped through her as he laughed and laughed, as he called for her to save him, as Rio made monster sounds.</p><p>
<i>”Mama! Mama! It’s gonna get me!</i>
</p><p>Her voice called from behind the camera.</p><p>
<i>“Maybe she’s a nice monster!”</i>
</p><p>Rio’s called after him, voice deep.</p><p>
<i>”She is a nice monster! Let her have a bite!</i>
</p><p>Agatha watched as Nicky turned the corner and made a beeline toward the camera.</p><p>
<i>”Mama please the monster is gonna eat me!</i>
</p><p>He slammed into her legs and the camera unfocused as she laughed.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t get ahold of herself. Her sobs came violently and drowned out the next clip. She felt Rio move against her and the video stopped. Hands touched her cheeks, pushed at her tears, but Agatha felt as if a dam had been torpedoed, utterly destroyed.</p><p>She cried as arms wrapped around her. She cried as words were mumbled into her ear. She cried as she tried to apologize for crying and couldn’t get the words out. Rio lowered them gently, hands in her hair and against her back, into the soft cushions of the couch.</p><p>She cried until she fell asleep.</p>

<i>Agatha climbed the steps toward her apartment with a nagging, irritating sensation in her chest. She reached her door and stilled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>For nine straight days, Agatha had walked away from her time with Rio withholding words that terrified her, words that had slunk their way into her skull and planted themselves as an unwavering truth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Every time they parted she wished she’d found a way to steal a few more moments. She craved Rio’s presence and her touch and the cleverness of her mind. She thought of little else.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They were exclusive. That had been made clear from Agatha’s demand months prior outside the dingy bar their cohort frequented; after she’d seen her sitting at the bar with Wanda.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Things had grown more serious after their misunderstanding outside the field office. After Agatha had gone to Rio's apartment to apologize and had discovered so much about her just from the way her posture had curled inward, the way she’d become quiet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had expected to continue on the way they had been previously. They’d mended the wound, there wasn’t a remnant of frustration or mistrust, and yet she felt a disturbance in her carefully constructed psyche.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was not oblivious. She knew herself well. She knew she had a tendency toward selfishness, a quick temper, an ego that she had crafted painstakingly under the abusive words and hands of her mother. Her expectations for the rest of her existence had been to live for herself, to do what she wanted to do, pursue what she wanted to pursue.</i>
</p><p>
<i>A shift had occurred somewhere between Rio taking the fall for her ill-considered stunt in Hogan’s alley and now. Their hundreds of moments; from the way their bodies fit together to the conversations that passed between them at work, tucked into the booths of bars, spoken, sweaty and exhausted, at the gym, or tucked under the sheets of their beds.</i>
</p><p>
<i>So no. Agatha was not oblivious. No matter how much she wanted to be, specifically for such inconvenient realizations. Rio had risen to be equal, and sometimes superseded, the importance and intentionality Agatha had placed on her freedom and her service to herself.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d discovered this from such a small moment, and it had nearly gotten her knocked out. She’d been at the gym with Rio, a normal routine they’d picked up to stay and shape and find time for one another. She’d finished her second set on the bench press and was resting with her head on the bench, Rio leaning on the bar and looking down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had been animated, her excitement clear in her eyes as she detailed the new hike she’d found out in Potomac. Agatha was actually listening; to the silly details like the elevation, the type of soil, which she had no idea why Rio knew, and the encounter Rio had with a wild turkey. She’d been so caught off guard by her willing attention that when Rio asked her if she wanted to go look, she’d said yes. The way Rio’s smile had taken over her whole face as she stared down at her had made the decision seem like a good one.</i>
</p><p>
<i>In the middle of her next set, one hundred and eighty-five pounds held overhead, Agatha had pondered her acquiescence and realized she’d probably do anything Rio asked of her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The epiphany had the bar leaning without her notice, and Rio had grabbed hold of it and pulled it into place before Agatha crushed her own windpipe.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d written it off as a cramp in her hand, something Rio hadn’t seemed to believe, and she’d finished her set with her heart in her throat.</i>
</p><p><i>It had been alarming, world-ending, in the moment. But after almost two weeks of thinking of little else, Agatha just </i>wanted.</p><p>
<i>She looked down at her feet on the floor mat outside her apartment door and blinked. Her key was already in the lock, but she pulled it out and drew her phone from her pocket.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d spent the past night at Rio’s apartment, leaving near two in the morning even though she’d wanted nothing more than to stay. It wasn’t like they’d never spent the nights together. At Quantico, on weekends, they often wound up crashing and waking up curled into one another. But weekdays were for work. They needed to be up early, they needed to be able to shower and change. Bringing a bag had always seemed so presumptuous, so permanent to Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>And Rio had never asked nor offered it herself.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha dialed and Rio answered on the first ring.</i>
</p><p>”Are you okay?”</p><p>
<i>Agatha swallowed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you– where are you?”</i>
</p><p>”I just got home."</p><p>
<i>Asking to go over, to stay, would have made the most sense. But the idea of being denied entry to Rio’s new home felt too monumental.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you want to come over?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was silent on the other end and Agatha nearly chewed through the side of her cheek as she waited. Her keys were digging painfully into her palm and she nearly took it back.</i>
</p><p>”Okay. Should I–”</p><p>
<i>“Bring your toothbrush. And clothes. Or whatever, I don’t care.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She hung up without another word and let out a heaving breath. Her skin was buzzing as she re-inserted her keys into her door and pressed inside. The anticipation and anxiety that followed in the twenty minutes it took Rio to knock on her door had her apartment nearly spotless, a new shine on her kitchen counters.</i>
</p><p><i>She walked toward it and yanked the door open, intending to pretend like this was normal, like asking Rio to </i>stay<i> like this hadn’t taken her a week and a half of mustering her courage.</i></p><p>
<i>And then she actually saw Rio at her doorstep just because she’d asked, no questions, with a backpack on her shoulder and an attempt at a blank expression on her face. She was wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt and she looked just as anxious as Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stepped to the side to let Rio inside and she closed the door behind her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Words were escaping her before she could think and they weren’t even the right ones.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I hate hiking.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s backpack slipped from her shoulder into her hand and she turned, her brows furrowing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s okay. You don’t have to come with me this weekend if you don’t want to.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shook her head, irritation sparking at herself and at Rio for somehow not connecting the dots with information that was only in Agatha’s brain.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No, I want to go with you.” She felt helpless. “Why the fuck do I want to go hiking?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio seemed even more confused.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m not– umm, is everything okay?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha drew in a breath, her lips pressing into a thin line. She tried to find the right starting point and instead, she stepped into Rio and kissed her. Hard. She heard Rio’s backpack drop to the ground as arms wrapped around her and she pushed and pulled them toward her bedroom as Rio tried to keep up with Agatha’s scattered approach to sharing her feelings.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They tumbled through the door and Rio pulled back slightly, her breath heaving. She studied Agatha, eyes searching. When Agatha attempted to kiss her again, Rio put a hand on her shoulder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt a sting in the back of her throat and the corner of her eyes. She let out a frustrated sigh and looked at Rio, who was becoming progressively more concerned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m sorry. I don’t know why this is so hard to say out loud.” She shook her head when Rio opened her mouth to speak. “No, just let me say it.” Agatha was an FBI agent and had survived so much worse than telling somebody how she felt. “Don’t get a big fucking head about it but I think you’re probably the most important thing in my life.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>There. She’d done it. Sort of.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s expression shifted, her brow smoothing out and she looked almost relieved, her corners of her mouth lifting slightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay—“</i>
</p><p>
<i>A flash of heat seared through Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you say ‘okay, yeah’ or any combination of those words, I’ll lose my fucking mind.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hand slid toward Agatha’s neck, her palm warm against the side of it. She repressed what looked like amusement and Agatha was about ready to kill her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I was going to say, ‘okay, I’m glad we’re on the same page.’ Finally.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha frowned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What do you mean? Finally?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes softened, her thumb rubbing against Agatha’s jaw.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ve been there for a while.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha reached toward Rio, wrapping her fingers in her shirt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why didn’t you say anything?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio huffed, her eyes rolling playfully.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Because, Agatha, I’ve had you clocked from the moment I met you. If I had pushed too fast, too soon, you would have felt pressured. Hell, if I’d shown too much eagerness early on, you would have dropped me. I didn’t want to scare you. And I know how to wait.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was torn between irritation, refusal, and wanting to fall into the sudden warmth that was flooding through her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She ended up with all three.</i>
</p><p><i>“I don’t think I’d ever be able to </i>drop<i> you. I think you forget, I like it when you’re eager.”</i></p><p>
<i>Rio smiled, her other hand matching placement on the other side of Agatha’s jaw.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You can simmer down now, Agatha. We’re on the same page.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha closed her eyes to gain control of her suddenly rampaging emotions and leaned her head into Rio’s hands. For the first time in her life, she wanted to surrender. Rio was so warm and she <i>saw</i> her. Understood her. The usual clamoring in the back of her skull that urged her to protect herself, to retreat, had grown shockingly quiet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha opened her eyes and refocused on Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“How long?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio lifted her brow in bemusement.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hmm?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You said you’ve been here for a while. How long?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shrugged.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think it was when you almost broke your collarbone sledding down that hill.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha balked, her widening.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s what did it? Me nearly dying?” She frowned, suddenly stricken. “Rio, that was almost six months ago.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Instead of showing a hint of embarrassment, Rio nodded, her smile turning wry. She let one of her hands wander down to the collarbone in question, her fingers searing through Agatha’s shirt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“One, you bruised your bone, I wouldn’t consider that a near death experience.” She shrugged again. “I didn’t totally know what I was feeling, if that helps. I’d only ever really cared about one person and I haven’t seen him in over ten years. Having anything remotely similar to that feeling kind of knocked me on my ass. I wanted to take care of you, I wanted to shatter Bohner’s ankles and bury him in a snow drift. You were so grumpy but I could tell you liked that I was there. I didn't want to leave you alone so I just let myself feel it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt a pang of regret for every moment she knew and didn’t tell Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Would you have just let me go without saying anything? If I hadn’t come to your apartment to clear the air?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>At this, Rio’s cheeks reddened. She extracted herself to sit down on Agatha’s bed, her hands placed behind her so she could lean back. It was a casual pose, but her words were anything but.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I had convinced myself that I was okay with whatever you wanted. I’ve lost everything before and I survived. I thought, ‘at least this time I’ll have my job.’” Rio looked away. “It didn’t feel like I was going to be okay but I was too stubborn. I don’t like handing people the stones to throw at me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha drew in a slow breath to ease the ache in her chest. She knelt between Rio’s knees, her hands settling against the soft, black sweats covering her thighs. The pose felt like suppliance; like ripping out her heart and holding it out to be devoured. She did it willingly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I felt like I was going mad when we weren’t speaking. I thought about you constantly.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hands laced around the back of Agatha’s neck.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Thank you for saying that.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Urgency surged in Agatha’s chest.</i>
</p><p><i>“I’m not just saying it. </i>I mean it.<i>” Agatha gripped Rio’s hips and pulled her closer. “I might have waited until today to say the words, but I think if you had let me walk out your door that day I wouldn’t have been okay.”</i></p><p>
<i>Rio’s enduring stoicism seemed to crumble, her jaw tightening as she drew in a breath through her nose. Her voice wavered when she spoke.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t want to have to guess anymore. Or hope that you want what I want.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha saw tears gather in the corners of Rio’s eyes and she thought she understood exactly what Rio had felt the day they went sledding. The need to mend, to provide any sort of comfort, had her feeling a kind of desperation she’d never experienced.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I want it. You. Rio, sweetheart,” Agatha brushed a tear as it fell, “I want it in every way that I can have it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was the one to surge forward then, her mouth colliding with Agatha’s, her hands wrapping around Agatha’s arms to pull her up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha straddled one of Rio’s thighs and pushed her back onto the bed. She felt Rio’s tears against her own cheek as she settled her weight down and slid her fingers into Rio’s hair.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio whimpered, a soft, relieved sound, and she placed her hand against Agatha’s ribs under her shirt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Please, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s body shuddered, those words, the importance of this moment, flooding her as she became distinctly aware of every part of their bodies that touched. This was new, this was a side of Rio she had never seen. There had been flashes, moments of submission that Agatha had stolen, but Rio’s complete surrender to her? The vulnerability, the trust; it had Agatha nearly vibrating.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She kissed the corner of Rio’s lips, her jaw, opened her mouth against her throat and sucked. The hand against her ribs tightened as Rio’s back arched from the bed–</i>
</p><p>Agatha blinked awake, her body thrumming and warm. Her heart was beating rapidly in her chest and she could only smell new fabric and the familiar scent of Rio curling around her. A soft blanket had been tucked around her and she felt heat and weight against her back.</p><p>Rio shifted and Agatha was made sharply aware of the way Rio’s hand sat so tightly against her ribcage. A simmering heat had started low in her belly and she tried to gather herself from the memory that had played out so vividly in her dreams. She wasn’t ready to leave, and didn't want to face what consciousness would bring.</p><p>She snuggled further into the cushions just as the hand on her ribs flexed. Contrasting sensations of desire and fear crowded her as Rio stirred.</p><p>Rio’s voice came out gravely with sleep and it rumbled through Agatha’s chest and sank low.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>
<i>Please Agatha.</i>
</p><p>Agatha breathed through the desire.</p><p>“I’m not– I don’t want to go yet.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers rubbed softly at Agatha’s side, her shirt having ridden up to reveal warm skin. Her thumb brushed against Agatha’s hipbone and Agatha’s mouth dropped open. She was infinitely glad for the dark and the fact that she was facing away from Rio.</p><p>Rio tightened her hold subtly.</p><p>“I don’t want you to go.”</p><p>Rio’s thumb swept across her skin and Agatha needed the motion to stop before she did something she shouldn’t. With careful movements, she twisted onto her back. Rio’s hand slid across Agatha’s lower stomach and ended on the other hip as Agatha faced her.</p><p>Her eyes were adjusting slowly to the pitch black and she could make out the shadows of Rio’s face in the moonlight. She drew in a breath and it wavered.</p><p>Seeing her like this, touching her like this, it felt like coming home. Not to the house they shared, not to the albums and the furniture, but Rio. Always Rio.</p><p>She slid her fingertips on the soft panes of Rio’s face, tracing under her eye and across her brow.</p><p>An inescapable, nearly fervent need settled in the hollow of her throat and slithered around her heart. She leaned forward and pressed her lips against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened on her hip as her lips parted, the tentative press becoming something solid and all-encompassing within moments.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled around Rio’s jaw and held her as she sank into the warmth of the kiss, the comfort of it. Her heartbeat felt out of sync, hammering despite the slow, easy press of their mouths, the wet slide of Rio’s tongue against her own.</p><p>It was so different from the times they’d clashed together since Agatha’s return. Instead of interaction laced with brittle hurt and acidity, this moment was gentle, a promise of something more. Agatha knew she was likely crying, she knew one of them was, but she pulled Rio closer and breathed as best she could when she was being held so tightly.</p><p>Rio’s hand slid under Agatha’s shirt, over her abdomen and to her chest, before slipping around her back and pressing her closer.</p><p>Agatha kissed Rio until she became overwhelmed with the way it dismantled her entirely. She tilted Rio’s head up and parted her lips against her throat, her tongue pressed flat against her skin, her teeth grazing lightly.</p><p>Rio shuddered, her head dropping back against the couch.</p><p>Agatha wanted to be everywhere, wanted to form her apologies with her hands and her mouth because the words were always so much harder. It had been like this for them from the beginning, the touch before the truth. They’d always had a physical language and Agatha would never forget how to speak it. Even after five years and endless tragedy, she would remember how to fit with Rio like this.</p><p>She lifted herself to resettle on top of Rio, her knee pressing between her legs. Rio’s hands tangled in Agatha’s hair and pulled her back to her mouth, the kiss greedy and claiming. Agatha groaned as Rio’s tongue pressed into her mouth and dragged against her teeth. She whined when Rio’s knee pressed into the seam of her sweatpants.</p><p>“Rio, baby–”</p><p>Rio tensed under her, a startling shift in body language that had Agatha pulling back, her eyes searching despite the blanket of darkness that shrouded them.</p><p>Agatha’s heart lodged in her throat.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio was silent for several beats, her chest rising and falling unsteadily. She drew in wet breath and covered her eyes with the crook of her elbow.</p><p>“Agatha I can’t do this if–”</p><p>She stopped like she couldn’t say the words.</p><p>She didn’t need to. Agatha understood with a clarity that she hadn’t had in years, with a heart that had once beat so in tune with Rio’s, a heart that was now finding its rhythm. She wanted light so she could see Rio better, but stepping away now was not an option.</p><p>She thought back to their conversation on the beach, how Rio had broken down and said words that had seemed so final in the moment. The longing that had curled behind every syllable, the hope that had still been there until the moment Agatha told her she hadn’t read her letters.</p><p>Her words came out softly.</p><p>“You said that I hurt others to make myself feel better; that I’d forgotten it wasn’t just me that lost our son.”</p><p>“Agatha, I was upset. I didn–”</p><p>Agatha touched the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“Shh, just let me say this, okay?” She drew in a deep breath before continuing. “You were right.” She thought of her conversations with Alder and amended her statement. “Mostly. I lashed out because it felt better to be bitter and angry than to feel the pain. And I didn’t forget, not really. Rather, I was entirely selfish in my grief. I barely survived it, and the truth of it is,” she sighed, “I think a part of me wondered if acknowledging the loss of you and the hurt you felt would destroy me.”</p><p>Agatha settled against Rio’s side, her hand settling against the center of her chest. She continued in the same low quiet voice.</p><p>“It’s no excuse. There’s nothing I can do to change the way I acted. But I’ve been working with Dr. Alder. It has helped. So much.”</p><p>Rio’s arm withdrew, and the light easing through the windows caught on the tears against her cheeks.</p><p>“The one you called a clown?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened.</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>Rio huffed.</p><p>“It was one of your last nights here before you moved out. You came home drunk and ranting about it.”</p><p>Shame pooled in Agatha’s chest and she focused her attention on what she was trying to say.</p><p>“Yes, that one. Until recently, it was as if I was viewing the world through the wrong prescription. I’d grown so accustomed to seeing what I wanted to see that it became nearly impossible to see anything else. Any time I did, I couldn’t bear it. The night after you removed me from the trafficking case, in Greece when I went rogue, when you sat with me in my office and things felt so familiar and so fucking easy.</p><p>“I made the wrong choices over and over and you kept showing up for me, kept looking at me like I was the reason you were alive.”</p><p>“You are.”</p><p>Agatha fell silent, her hand curling into a fist against Rio’s chest. She felt the blow before it came.</p><p>Rio’s hand settled on hers.</p><p>“The knowledge that you’d still be here made it impossible for me to give up.”</p><p>There was a weight behind the words, an insinuation that shredded through Agatha and brought tears to her eyes. She laced her fingers with Rio’s.</p><p>“I used to believe that I’d never overcome the gaping wound Nicky’s death carved in me. I never thought I’d heal. I still have such a long way to go, but you did save me; bringing me here, giving me my life back in every way you could. I’m so sorry for what it did to you.”</p><p>Rio drew in a shaky breath.</p><p>“I’m glad. And I’m so tired, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, withdrawing her hand to cup Rio’s face.</p><p>“I know, love. And there’s more to be said, more to face, but I just…I want to take care of you right now. Can I do that?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched under her palm, then her head nodded slowly.</p><p>“Yes. Please.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in to press their mouths together, her tongue easing between Rio’s lips, gliding along her teeth and stroking against her tongue.</p><p>Rio whimpered and Agatha held her tighter, kissing her deep and slow until Rio’s body seemed to sink into the cushions beneath her. Only then did Agatha let her hand wander, her fingers drawing down Rio’s throat, dipping into her collarbone, scratching at the skin above her chest.</p><p>Agatha palmed Rio’s chest before her hand fell lower, pressing under Rio’s shirt and sliding against her skin, the soft divots of her abdomen. Agatha nearly moaned as her fingers met no barrier, gliding lightly on Rio’s breast. She kissed Rio again, her hand becoming firm as she massaged Rio’s chest, a nipple squeezed lightly between two of her fingers.</p><p>Rio’s back arched, hand tangling in Agatha's hair and fisting to keep her close.</p><p>Agatha tried to focus, tried not to be overwhelmed by how good it felt to touch Rio again like this. She scratched a little harder down Rio’s stomach, and the responding gasp from Rio into her mouth had her own body coming alive.</p><p>She broke the kiss to press her face into Rio’s throat. She bit gently, then scraped her teeth against the delicate skin.</p><p>Rio’s hips jolted and Agatha hummed into her throat.</p><p>She sucked against Rio’s pulse, her tongue pressing flat, and bit again, this time harder. Every twitch of Rio’s body, every sound leaving her mouth, clicked into place in Agatha’s mind like it hadn’t been years since she’d loved her like this, since she’d broken Rio into pieces.</p><p>Agatha’s nails continued to paint faint marks on Rio’s stomach and sides. She shifted her mouth down Rio’s throat to the hollow of it, and Rio’s chin tilted back.</p><p>Agatha laved her tongue up to her jaw, tasting salt and skin and Rio. Her fingers slid under the band of Rio’s sweats to tease at her hip, pressing into the muscle before returning to her shirt. She pushed herself up enough to guide the shirt up Rio’s body and push it over her head. Agatha stared at the expanse of skin, the way it pebbled under the sudden onslaught of cool air, her chest rising and falling rapidly.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help herself. She resettled and kissed beneath Rio’s breasts, between them, on the soft curve of one, and then closed her mouth over Rio’s nipple. They made nearly matching sounds, pitched high and desperate.</p><p>Agatha circled Rio’s nipple with her tongue while her hand palmed the other breast. She teased with her tongue and then grazed her teeth against the sensitive peak.</p><p>Rio’s hips shifted again, toward Agatha’s leg, and the hand in Agatha’s hair became near-painful. Agatha cooed softly.</p><p>“It’s alright, darling.” She drew her hand down, nails digging a bit harder until she reached Rio’s sweats. She slid beneath and scratched at the soft skin of Rio’s inner thigh. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Rio’s thigh muscle trembled under her hand and Agatha smiled against her chest.</p><p>She took her time, working Rio up with the firm slide of her hand on her muscles, the drag of her nails across her skin, the wet heat of her mouth against her chest and throat, until Rio was a live-wire. Her hips were never still, her body jumping and at every touch, and Agatha knew exactly where to touch and taste.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was harsh, her head pressed back into the couch, and both of her hands were clinging to Agatha’s head and back and shoulders with desperate movements.</p><p>“Please. I need–”</p><p>Her words choked off as Agatha cupped through her underwear for the first time.</p><p>Agatha groaned, fingers firm against the soaked, heated fabric.</p><p>“I know what you need. Keep breathing for me, love.”</p><p>Rio whimpered, the sound turning mournful as Agatha withdrew.</p><p>Agatha pushed herself down Rio’s body and kissed her stomach. She tugged Rio’s sweats lower and pressed open-mouthed kisses against her hip bone.</p><p>“Lift your hips for me.”</p><p>Rio did so quickly, one of her hands gripping the edge of the couch above her head, the other twisting tightly into the cushion beneath her.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into her waistband and pulled Rio’s sweats low, one side, then the other, until she was able to tug them off. Rio reached down and pushed at her underwear.</p><p>“These too.”</p><p>Agatha guided Rio’s hand away, kissing her knuckles and placing her fingers in her hair. She might have ignored the request at any other time, pushed Rio to her fracturing point, but even she was becoming impatient. Her mouth watered slightly, her chest rising and falling in anticipation of tasting Rio again.</p><p>Rio’s hips lifted and she slid the underwear down her legs.</p><p>Agatha moaned at the sight before her; Rio’s thighs spread as far as they could be, the short, coarse hair dusting her skin, her slit drenched, the dark pink she knew it to be was just a shade in the moonlight.</p><p>Agatha shifted and drew Rio’s leg over her head, outside her shoulder, to settle herself between her thighs. She pressed her mouth against Rio’s thigh just beside her cunt, her teeth meeting skin and applying just enough pressure to hurt.</p><p>Agatha groaned and licked the imprints of her teeth as Rio tried to drag her in place. She turned and blew a cool stream of air against Rio’s clit.</p><p>Rio’s back arced off the bed and Agatha wrapped her arms under Rio’s thighs to hold her hips in place.</p><p>The patch of hair tickled Agatha’s nose as she finally dragged her tongue the length of Rio’s slit. Agatha moaned and Rio cried out as she pressed her tongue flat against Rio’s clit, then back down to taste her fully.</p><p>Her tongue sank into molten slick and dragged it back up as Rio’s hips jolted again.</p><p>Agatha groaned into her, tongue sinking as deep as she could, her thumb finding Rio’s clit to add pressure as she fucked her with her mouth first.</p><p>Rio’s whines echoed in her skull as she devoured her and she hardly felt the sharp tugs in her hair as Rio rode her tongue, her hips rolling hard into Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Agatha was certain she wasn’t silent, could feel the vibration of sound humming through her into Rio, but she was singly-focused, her heart pounding as she built Rio up.</p><p>Rio’s hips jumped hard as she pressed with her thumb and Agatha retreated slightly to refocus her mouth on her clit. She circled it with her tongue, dragged her tongue side to side, over and over, until Rio’s whines rose in pitch, until her hips lifted and didn’t fall back down.</p><p>Rio’s sound cut out completely as her body grew taut, her hand in Agatha’s hair sharp and desperate.</p><p>Agatha felt the sudden, sharp urge to be inside her, to feel the orgasm as it tore through Rio’s body. She withdrew one of her hands and found enough space to press a finger to Rio’s entrance.</p><p>Just as Rio’s body trembled, began to settle, Agatha pressed a finger inside.</p><p>Rio whimpered.</p><p>“I can’t–”</p><p>Agatha released the pressure of Rio’s clit and kissed her thigh.</p><p>“I’ll be gentle, baby. I haven’t forgotten what you can take.” Rio’s walls clenched around Agatha’s digit and slick seeped across her knuckles. “That’s it.” She pulled out and pressed back in with two fingers, both sliding with no resistance. “I missed your taste.” Agatha groaned, pumping her fingers slowly. “I missed how you sound when you come for me, love.”</p><p>Rio pushed down onto her fingers desperately.</p><p>Agatha kept her fingers in place as she crawled back up and crashed her mouth onto Rio’s.</p><p>Rio’s hands scrabbled against her back, her nails digging in as soon as Agatha withdrew and thrust her fingers again.</p><p>Agatha continued at a deep, slow pace until Rio’s kisses became an open-mouthed pant, her breath hot against Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>She sped up her thrusts, driving hard, over and over, with a startling realization that she was just as close as Rio despite not being touched.</p><p>Agatha pressed her face into the crook of Rio’s neck and shoulder and gasped into her skin as Rio’s walls fluttered around her fingers. She clamped her teeth into the muscle of Rio’s shoulder and added a third finger at once, the simultaneous action pushing Rio over the edge again.</p><p>She came sharply, this one shorter but nearly as potent as the last orgasm, and wrapped her arms around Agatha’s body as she rode it out.</p><p>Agatha’s body trembled with her own near-orgasm and she barely withheld the cry that tried to slip through her lips. She slipped her fingers from Rio and wiped them against her pants before wrapping Rio in a tight hug. Rio was already holding her loosely, her high slowly fading away.</p><p>She took a shaky breath and let herself be pulled into Agatha’s body.</p><p>Agatha dragged the blanket over them and pressed a kiss to Rio’s temple.</p><p>There would be time for them to talk later, time for the dissolution of hurts. But, for now, they’d spoken in the language they knew best.</p><p>Rio’s voice was weak when she spoke into Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Just give me a second and I can–”</p><p>“No, sweetheart.” Agatha pressed another kiss, this one to the top of Rio’s head. “Sleep.”</p><p>Rio didn’t argue, not this time. She curled further into Agatha and let out a deep, relieved sigh.</p><p>Agatha ran her fingers through Rio’s hair, the locks silky against her skin.</p><p>They laid there for several minutes in silence, Agatha fading in and out of consciousness, her mind stumbling over something she couldn’t name. It came to her just as she was about to slip away.</p><p>“I mean it, Rio. I hope you know that.”</p>

<p>Agatha woke to a wet, scratchy sensation on her forehead. She blinked against the bright sun streaming in through the windows and plants and casting strange patterns of light across the room. When she twisted and reached up to rub at the spot, her hand hit soft hair and a small frame. Sharp teeth pressed against her skin but didn’t bite.</p><p>She glanced up to find a strangely familiar, if older, orange tabby looking down at her curiously.</p><p>A clang came from the kitchen, a sizzle, followed by a quiet curse. Agatha blinked, taking a moment to process the multiple sensory inputs, and the scent of bacon slowly seeped in.</p><p>She blinked again and her memory seemed to awaken, recalling the feel of Rio’s body against hers, the pretty arch of her back, the way she’d sounded when she was falling apart under Agatha’s touch.</p><p>Agatha drew in a sharp breath and the scent of <i>Rio</i> was all around her. She closed her eyes and tried to collect herself. A loud whir of a purr sounded next to her ear and a small, soft head rubbed against her crown.</p><p>She absently reached up and stroked the cat around its ears, a smile pulling at her lips knowing that Rio had found herself something to fill in a piece of their empty home.</p><p>With a startling capriciousness Agatha was familiar with in herself, the creature suddenly bit her skull and darted away.</p><p>Agatha yelped and sat up, her eyes following the fiery form of the cat as it ran toward the kitchen. As it disappeared from sight, feet– donning socks with what looked like cartoon sheep on them– appeared in its place. Agatha’s eyes trailed up Rio’s legs to the achingly familiar apron, now faded a muddy gray, to the wrinkled t-shirt, to the lines of her collarbones and the slender curve of her neck.</p><p>She held her breath as she reached Rio’s face. God, she was beautiful.</p><p>Agatha stared because she finally could; at Rio’s sharp jaw, the softness of her cheeks, the adorable slope of her nose, the deep brown of her wide eyes as they took in Agatha with uncertainty.</p><p>The quiet lasted a beat too long and Rio swallowed.</p><p>“Sorry. I should have warned you I had a roommate. He’s kind of an asshole.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No, it’s– that’s alright.” She tried to find words that weren’t bathed in <i>too much</i>, and grasped at the first thing that came to mind. “Is that Boggle?” And because she had just woken up and she was feeling a twin need to keep the conversation going and let Rio talk, Agatha continued. “Did Mr. O’Malley die? Did he give you his cat?” Agatha frowned. “Wasn’t his cat old?”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched.</p><p>“Kian didn’t die. He’s in assisted living. They allow animals but he didn’t like the idea that Boggle would be stuck inside. I take him for visits almost every week.”</p><p>As if hearing his name, Boggle returned to the room and Agatha took him in again. He looked decrepit, ancient. His long nose had old scars that marred the pattern of the fur. One of his ears seemed to be missing a small piece.</p><p>“How old is he?”</p><p>Rio leaned down and scratched behind Boggle’s ears as he rubbed against her legs.</p><p>“I think seventeen? Kian was pretty loose with his birthdays.”</p><p>Agatha sat back on the couch and tried not to let her heart melt into pieces at the fact that Rio had adopted their neighbor’s cat. That she took said cat to visit his owner.</p><p>Boggle slinked toward her, a hitch in his walk. She reached out and he rubbed easily against her palm. He was soft despite the patches of his skin that held small scars. He’d always been a little rough around the edges, but age had made him look frumpy. She stroked down his back several times and Agatha’s chest tightened as she remembered how much Nicky had enjoyed his time with Boggle.</p><p>The distinct smell of burning filled her nose and she looked back toward Rio.</p><p>“What’s cooking?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened and she bolted back toward the kitchen, sliding on her socks. It was endearing in a way that warmed Agatha from head to toe.</p><p>She stood up to follow and Boggle swiped at her legs, catching them in her sweats, before darting off.</p><p>She huffed out a laugh and moved easily toward the kitchen, the action only catching up to her as she caught sight of a framed picture on the wall: Nicky and Wanda sitting with both of their legs buried deep in the sand, their smiles blinding as they looked at the camera.</p><p>Agatha’s heart lurched and she slowed her movements, her steps far more hesitant as she moved through the space that had once been her home; that, in some ways, felt like it still was.</p><p>She stepped into the kitchen and found Rio frowning down at the pan like she wasn’t certain whether to toss it or attempt to salvage it. To Agatha, it looked like whatever flavor there was had been burned out, but Rio had surprised her before.</p><p>“I thought you’d developed proper cooking habits.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, her eyes narrowing as she glanced back at Agatha.</p><p>“I did. I got distracted.” She cleared her throat. “I thought Boggle had maimed you.”</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“Oh, my apologies. You were coming to my rescue.”</p><p>It felt so easy slipping into this back and forth.</p><p>Rio shrugged, repressing a smile.</p><p>“Someone had to.”</p><p>The words resounded in Agatha’s skull. Her tone leaned into sincerity more openly than she meant it to.</p><p>“You always have a way of knowing when I need it.”</p><p>Rio, who had been walking the pan toward the trash can, slowed. She seemed ready to say something and then thought better of it. She dumped the blackened remains of the bacon in the trash and set the hot pan in the empty sink to cool.</p><p>“Do you want coffee?”</p><p>Agatha saw the erecting defenses and debated between letting them settle in place or nudging at the supports. In the past, the answer would have been an easy one. But Agatha hesitated. She was afraid. She didn’t want to push too soon, to back Rio into a corner and force words she wasn’t ready to say; words Agatha might not be ready to hear.</p><p>“Sure. Thank you.” She watched Rio retrieve a package from the fridge and set it on the counter before she turned to the coffee maker. “Do you want me to cook?”</p><p>Rio stood in front of the counter and stared down at the machine, her fingertips resting lightly on the marble.</p><p>Agatha grimaced, a flicker of panic in her chest at the thought of overstepping.</p><p>“Sorry, I–” She tried to find an escape. “Do you have a spare toothbrush by chance?”</p><p>Rio’s expression was hard to read.</p><p>“I do; in the upstairs guest bathroom.” She retrieved mugs from the cabinet and set them on the counter, her eyes widening slightly. “I can go–”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No, it’s okay. It’s just the guest bedroom.”</p><p>She felt overwhelmed standing here in this kitchen like it were a stranger’s, like she hadn’t spent years there. Everything was still in its familiar place except the trash can. Rio had wanted it under the counter, Agatha hated having to open a door to throw something out. It had been a repeating conversation, one Agatha had initially won due to sheer stubbornness.</p><p>Rio looked like she might insist, but her eyes fell back to the mugs.</p><p>Agatha felt marginally better about the fact that Rio seemed to be struggling with this just as much.</p><p>She didn’t think as she wound her way toward the stairs, her feet carrying her through the space like it hadn’t been nearly six years since she’d walked it. She started her journey up, the board on the second step, and the seventh, creaking predictably.</p><p>It wasn’t until she reached the hallway that her mind caught up with her body.</p><p>She stared down the hallway, four doors; three open, one closed. There were four rooms on this level: one, the master suite; another, Nicky’s room; and the third, a guest bedroom that had rarely been used.</p><p>The fourth door led to the guest bathroom.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t look at the one closed door, despite its gravitational pull, and her heart crawled into her throat as she forcibly moved herself to the guest bathroom.</p><p>The uncertainty from the kitchen had been forgotten as Agatha fell into a fugue state. She was steps away from the heart of the home. The beat of it, the pattern of it against her own chest, came alive as she mechanically pulled the mirror open and withdrew a toothbrush.</p><p>They’d spent so much time in that room. In Nicky’s space. They’d made it for him, adding and retracting bits as he grew, as his personality and his joys made themselves apparent.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure how long she stared unseeing into the mirror, her eyes only refocusing after she’d finished brushing her teeth; mint foam sat in the corners of her mouth and the toothbrush was held in an iron grip in her hand. She looked haunted, her hair a wild mane around her face, her eyes sunken in memories.</p><p>She spit, cleaned her mouth, and washed the bristles, unsure if she should throw away the toothbrush or put it back in the mirror. She didn’t have the mental acuity to worry about it and she set it back inside the mirror with a slow hand. She walked into the hallway.</p><p>She needed to go back downstairs. She needed… Agatha stopped at Nicky’s door, her breathing a fluttery, useless thing. Downstairs. She wasn’t ready. She couldn’t open that door knowing Nicky’s perfect little face wouldn’t be waiting for her.</p><p>Agatha’s hand settled on the doorknob, the cool metal against her palm, and twisted.</p><p>The door swung into the room and Agatha froze.<br/>___</p><p>She was thirty-five again, curled onto Nicky’s bed, alone, with an unbearable weight, a twisting, gurgling pain choking her, killing her.<br/>___</p><p>She was thirty-four, kneeling on the terrible, scratchy rug with a little town on it, Nicky’s toy cars scattered around her on the roads.</p><p>
<i>Rio was laid out, Nicky between them, and they lived in his imagination as he told them a story about the town’s hospital, how the nice doctors all worked there.</i>
</p><p><i>Agatha and Rio had met gazes over his head, mirrored dread, mirrored terror, as they remembered the call from the doctor that day.</i><br/>___</p><p>She was thirty-three, sitting on the bed, listening to her little boy cry because he’d gotten in trouble at daycare.</p><p>
<i>He’d taken another kid’s toy during their play time. Rio wasn’t home yet, her case keeping her late at the office, and Agatha was trying to figure out if she had to affirm the discipline or pull him into her arms and take away his sadness. She was weak to his tiny sniffles, his blue eyes tinged with red.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She smiled at him, reaching out her arms.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Come here, baby.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He wailed and scrambled into her lap, his hands clinging to her shirt, his head tucking against her chest. She ran her hand through his hair, her fingers slipping through his soft, brown locks.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Nicky, can you look at mama?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He had started to calm, to take shuddering breaths, but he shook his head against her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She smiled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Can you listen to mama?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She pressed a kiss to his head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Did you say sorry to Siya?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He nodded, his sniffles slowing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She ran a soothing handle down his back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m proud of you for saying sorry.” She listened to his steady breathing. “We don’t want to make our friends sad. Do mommy or I take things from you without asking?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>His voice was still tinged with tears and Agatha squeezed him tighter.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s right, Nicky. And you are so good at sharing. Your teacher has told us that you are kind to your friends. Do you think you can ask next time you want to share a toy with your friend?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He nodded against her again and Agatha could tell this breakdown was leading into an excellent nap.</i>
</p><p>
<i>That was how Rio found them as she came up the stairs. She looked worried– Nicky was rarely in trouble– that worry slowly faded as she took in the soft smile Agatha turned toward her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s back hurt, her arms had gone numb from Nicky’s limp weight in them, but she wasn’t going to move until he stirred.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio walked in quietly, a question in her eyes.</i>
</p><p><i>Agatha freed a hand to reach for her, to pull her in and press a kiss to her lips.</i><br/>___</p><p>She was thirty-two and it was the middle of the night. Rio wasn’t next to her in their bed.</p><p>
<i>She listened for Nicky, for movement, and found nothing. With a body sore from a rather painful encounter with a suspect that had tried to run, Agatha rolled out of bed and walked into the hallway. Nicky’s door was open, and as she moved closer, she heard a gentle murmuring and the swing of the rocking chair in his room.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She slowed outside to listen and Rio’s voice carried soft and low to her ears.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“...garden. It’s an Islamic symbol of paradise. They built these gardens in four parts with axial waterways that all lead into a square basin at the center. These waterways were a representation of rivers mentioned in an Islamic oral anecdote; Euphrates, Jayhan, Sayhan, and the Nile. The gardens themselves–”</i>
</p><p><i>Rio faded off as Agatha made herself known, her eyes adjusting in the dark room. She hadn’t been able to help herself. She took in her wife, in sleep-boxers– Agatha could barely make out the Ghostfaces printed all over them–  and a lavender hoodie. Nicky was fast asleep in her arms, his head lolled back, his mouth open, and Agatha loved them more than she would ever love anything.</i><br/>___</p><p>She was thirty-one, sitting in an empty room with paint splotches on the wall, trying to decide what color to paint the nursery.</p><p>
<i>Rio was in a full, forest green jumpsuit, her recently-cut, shoulder-length hair kept from her eyes by a baseball hat worn backwards. She looked… infuriatingly hot. Infuriating because she had banished Agatha to the singular chair in the room and refused to let her help beyond making decisions.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, I can help pick a color, standing, without going into labor. I’m not due for three weeks.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio ignored her, her eyes focused on the splotches. She backed away, then stepped forward again. She walked to the blinds and closed them, opened them, closed them again. She opened them with a huff.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I can’t decide if I want the Moonmist or Light Daffodil.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Just choose one, love.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio turned to her with a frown.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You have to help.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha raised a brow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I wanted Languid Lavender.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shook her head emphatically</i>
</p><p>
<i>“This is science-based! Some colors help a baby’s brain development.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had no issue with the colors that Rio had narrowed it down to. She liked both of them. They matched with all of the purchased items that were sitting in their garage, unopened, because Rio had stalled on the first step for so long. That didn’t mean she’d keep from antagonizing her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Aren’t purple and blue basically the same?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s head whirled to her, mouth open to argue, before she took in Agatha’s expression and huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Stop that.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stood, getting up awkward because of the large swell of her belly. Rio started to move toward her, to help, but Agatha waved her off. She gripped Rio’s adorable jumpsuit and gave her a pointed look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Pick a color, Vidal, or I’m going to throw you out and hire somebody to do it. We can put so many other colors on the wall once we’re done.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked affronted, her cheeks reddening.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You wouldn’t.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha softened, her fingers brushing Rio’s cheek.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I wouldn’t.” She ran her thumb over Rio’s bottom lip. “Are you a little bit freaking out?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s jaw twitched, her eyes darting away for a moment.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I just want it to be perfect.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha melted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I know, sweetheart.” She pulled Rio in, pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth. “But both of these are perfect, okay? Nothing will stop us from changing it in the future if your science-based color theory suddenly reveals that Moonmist or Light Daffodil can turn your baby into a snob.” Agatha stepped back, giving Rio a pointed look. “I’m going to go downstairs to make lunch–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio set down her brush.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I can make–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha cut her off.</i>
</p><p><i>“</i>I’m<i> going to make lunch. You are going to pick a color and paint. When you are done, we can talk about why you are freaking out. Then you can fuck me because I have been thinking about it all morning with you in this ridiculous outfit.”</i></p><p>
<i>Rio’s doubt faded out, replaced with a smug, heated look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s a lot of orders from somebody who likes to be bent over a desk.”<br/>__</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio finished painting by four, taking a break to eat lunch, and afterwards they’d sat in their enclosed patio and talked.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had paint on her jumpsuit, her face, in her hair– despite the hat she’d been wearing. It was almost ridiculous how much she’d managed to get on herself, but Agatha could hardly sit still with the way she wanted to touch her. It was hormones, definitely hormones.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hair was slightly frizzy and Agatha bit back a groan at the thought of running her hands through it. She really needed to focus.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Talk to me. We covered why I’m scared. Why are you scared?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio pouted, her back against the large couch and her toes tucked under Agatha’s thigh.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“There’s just– there’s so much that can go wrong? What if we actually fuck up? What if he grows up and thinks we’re lame? What if we’re too disciplined or too soft? What if–” She paused, her chest rising and falling, and Agatha knew they were reaching the root of it. “We’re both FBI Agents, Agatha. What if something happens to us? No kid should be put through the system.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s heart broke like it always did when Rio talked about her experience, about what it was like to be a kid carted around and abused by the people who were supposed to take care of her. She shifted, lifted Rio’s legs and shifted closer, then set her calves into her lap. She rubbed soothingly on Rio’s thigh.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Should anything happen to us, for any reason, you know that Wanda would never allow Nicky to experience anything but love.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio smiled lightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Have you told Wanda that she’s going to be his designated guardian?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed out a laugh.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“She better. He’s not going to my mother.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha could see her fears were not fully gone, could see how they lingered behind her eyes and in the downturn of her mouth. She gripped Rio’s hands in hers.</i>
</p><p><i>“Rio, I promise you: no matter what happens– big or small– we’re in this together. We’ll face it together.”</i><br/>________</p><p>Agatha stood in the center of Nicky’s room with lungs that weren’t working the way they should. She couldn’t breathe. She couldn’t think. Memories of him came back, their definition sharper from the album, from the videos.</p><p>His laugh had been her favorite sound for three years, his chubby cheeks and his tiny hands and his curious eyes had become her world.</p><p>The room was exactly as she’d left it when she’d run away. When she’d left Rio. When she’d broken her promise.</p><p>
<i>”I lost Nicky and I lost you and I sat in our empty house for weeks waiting for you to make good on your promise, waiting for you to remember through all your grief that somebody else was there suffering beside you!”</i>
</p><p>Agatha wept. She knelt down on the scratchy rug and stared at the empty bed with its sage green sheets, because Nicky had decided his bed should look like his mommies. The walls were still Moonmist, the pictures hanging, some of their family, some drawn by Nicky, hadn’t been moved or taken down.</p><p>There were toys put away in their containers like he’d done the best job at cleaning his room right before he died. The silly awards he’d won at daycare sat proudly on the shelves: ‘Best Listener of West Potomac Daycare,’ ‘Aspiring Artist,’ ‘Most Generous.’ He’d been so proud of them even though he hadn’t understood what they meant, only that he was good, and other people liked that he was good. His mommies loved that he was good.</p><p>Agatha expected she might pass out, might collapse on the floor and find herself stuck in this room for weeks like she had when Nicky was gone.</p><p>She tried to breathe, tried to gather herself. It wouldn’t be fair to Rio to make her take care of her, to make her live that again. She wiped her eyes and blinked harshly.</p><p>And suddenly, despite the sharp spiral into desolation, Agatha’s eyes caught on a small, stuffed rabbit resting against the pillows on Nicky’s bed.</p><p>Señor Scratchy, his fur well-loved, his body saggy from the time his stuffing had fallen out of a large tear in the foot, sat just like she’d left it.</p><p>She felt her lungs release and she drew in a deep, pained breath. And another. And another. Until the panic that had begun to crawl up her throat became something aching instead. She walked toward it, a trembling hand reaching out to touch its fur. She picked Scratchy up and closed her eyes, pressing the stuffed animal held against her stomach.</p><p>She withdrew from the clawing hands of despair, from the shame and the grief, and tried to follow Alder’s advice.<br/>__</p><p>
<i>Agatha and Rio held Nicky’s hands on either side as he waddled down an aisle that almost exclusively held stuffed animals. His eyes were saucers, his head turning back and forth as he tried to take everything in.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio leaned toward Agatha and spoke quietly, her eyes bright.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“He’s going to pick something weird. Like a chicken. Or a frog.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha chuckled and tilted her head down the aisle.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think he’s going to pick one of those massive ones at the end. That highland cow or the elephant.” She laughed. “Or that gargantuan bee.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio raised her brow, reaching her free hand out in a handshake.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Loser makes dinner.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m making dinner, Rio. It’s not good for a toddler to inhale smoke.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio gasped, her hand withdrawing to rest on her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I can cook, Agatha!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha grinned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I didn’t say you couldn’t. But your cooking is the most chaotic thing about you and I want Nicky to be able to recognize food when he’s older. What if he goes to daycare and thinks somebody’s eggs are mashed potatoes because your ability to craft absurdly wrong-textured food is second to none?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio blew out her cheeks, shaking her head in disappointment.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m never making you another one of my garbage plates.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed again and this time Nicky slowed, his head turning up at them.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Mama?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha refocused, her smile widening and she leaned down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes, love?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky pulled his hand free and reached up, his eyes shiny like he might cry if he didn’t get picked up immediately.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was never one to deny him. She hefted him into her arms, giving Rio a look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“How long is this phase going to last?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio chuckled, her hand slow to let go of his.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, him needing to be a part of every single conversation even though he doesn’t know what we’re saying?” Rio’s eyes went soft as she watched Nicky press his cheek into Agatha’s shoulder. “I hope forever.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, we cannot raise a jealous, little monster.” Agatha scratched lightly on Nicky’s back. “Baby, do you want to pick a stuffed animal?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He immediately pulled back up like he’d forgotten, his feet kicking her hip as he tried to turn around.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha turned him in her arms and they continued down the aisle. He reached a hand out suddenly, and Agatha slowed and walked in the direction of his reach.</i>
</p><p>
<i>He put his hand on a polar bear. He picked it up and dropped it almost immediately, his hand reaching out again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio bent to grab the toy and replace it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>For the next three minutes, it was a terrible, hilarious game of Nicky tossing animals on the ground and giggling, and Rio pretending to groan and reshelve them.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was almost certain they weren’t going to get a decision that day. Rio and her would likely need to pick one for him and they’d be able to try again another time.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky’s hand circled around a rabbit and his eyes widened slightly as he dropped it on the ground. When Rio went to pick it up, Nicky reached toward it again, a small cry coming from his mouth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio held the rabbit out to him and Nicky wrapped both of his arms around it, entirely distracted from his favorite game of tossing shit on the floor.</i>
</p><p><i>Agatha met Rio’s eyes over his head and shrugged.</i><br/>_______</p><p>Agatha blinked into the present, her body relaxing from the near free-fall. Her breathing levelled.</p><p>She felt Rio’s presence at her back and turned.</p><p>Rio was leaning against the doorframe, her arms crossed over her chest, her expression a mix of pride and concern. Agatha wanted to spill dozens of apologies; she wanted to beg for a forgiveness she knew Rio would always give her even when she didn’t deserve it.</p><p>Rio’s lips lifted into a quiet smile.</p><p>“I remember thinking Señor Scratchy would be just another toy. We had no idea how much he’d adore it.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands were tight on the stuffed bunny’s fur.</p><p>“I know he picked it because it was so soft, but it really turned into his world there for a moment.” She sighed. “Remember the petting zoo–”</p><p>Rio’s expression faltered, her eyes shining slightly as she nodded.</p><p>“I’ll never forget his face when they practically swarmed him. He wasn’t afraid at all. He was so gentle.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, her lungs growing tight again.</p><p>“I think– I’m sorry I just came in here–”</p><p>Rio shook her head firmly.</p><p>“Agatha, this was our son’s room. It does not belong to me.”</p><p>Agatha breathed her relief, her body fluctuating between so many emotions. She looked past Rio into the hallway. She was happy she’d done it; it was freeing in a way. But now she needed an escape, a respite.</p><p>Rio always knew. She pushed from the doorframe and stepped back.</p><p>“Do you want to see anything else?”</p><p>Agatha stepped toward her with a sudden need to touch, to make sure this was real. She refrained.</p><p>“Is ou– is the master bedroom the same?”</p><p>Rio led her toward the familiar door where it hung ajar and waited with a more passive expression.</p><p>With Señor Scratchy in her hands, Agatha closed Nicky’s door reverently, pressed her hand against the wood, and stepped away.</p><p>She walked to the doorway of her old room and felt like she’d had a tire iron swung into her chest.<br/>______</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt the cool, soft smack of a leaf against her face and she growled as she ducked under the banana leaves of the bird of paradise taking up the corner of their room beside their bathroom. As she looked toward it, she nearly tripped over a stack of boxes on the floor by the bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She glared at the plant and turned as Rio stepped from the closet in briefs and nothing else. Agatha got sidetracked for a moment, her eyes dipping down to Rio’s chest, then to the narrow slope of her hips. She blinked back up and found Rio smirking.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha deepened her scowl and pointed to the massive plant. She would not be swayed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I thought we agreed that the bedroom would be a bit more sparsely vegetated.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shrugged, her cheeks flushing slightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It looks really good there.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha raised her brow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It attacked me when I walked out of the bathroom.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio frowned when Agatha didn’t agree.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sorry, I should have checked.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha sighed and walked up to her, taking her face in her hands.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“My love, I’m so happy to have plants in our room, but I also think it’s a little absurd that you’ve found a place for all of your plants and you have yet to unpack a single one of your boxes.” She softened the blow with a brush of her thumb, her lips quirking into a smile.  “Can we maybe table the decision-making on where they’ll go until we get all of our things unpacked?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded, her eyes glancing toward the plant in the corner.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yeah– Yes.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha smiled softly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Listen to me, Rio Vidal, we have lived together for long enough that you should know I will fold the moment you explain exactly why the banana plant should be there in the corner, hitting me in the face every time I leave the bathroom. But let’s get settled in and see if there might possibly be another place for it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio huffed, her eyes rolling playfully.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It actually told me it prefers the corner so it can watch you shower. I like to respect their agency.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha narrowed her eyes and lifted Rio’s wrist to check her watch. Thirty minutes until they had to leave for work. She could work with that.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio frowned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What are you–”</i>
</p><p><i>Her question cut off in an uncharacteristic squeal as Agatha’s hands circled her waist and threw her onto their bed.</i><br/>___</p><p>The banana plant was still proudly in the corner of the room, the leaves obstructing a good fourth of the bathroom door. The walls were still the same; a warm beige for three walls, a lichen accent wall behind the bed. The bedframe, golden-brown, was partially covered by a tan duvet and what looked like too many blankets of forest green and sage. It was made. Of course. Even in Rio’s hardest moments, she always started her morning the same way.</p><p>Agatha had given over control of their room to Rio in the end. It had been an easy decision. From the moment they’d lived together, even before, she’d known how much the space meant to Rio. It was her safeguard, something that belonged to her.</p><p>There were more plants now, more books dotting the shelves, but the decoration was achingly the same. The framed posters of her horror movies, the dried plants strung with twine, the photos from their time at Quantico, their time growing close with Wanda, Agatha’s strange artwork she’d randomly buy at flea markets and antique stores. The rug partially under the bed– covering a good portion of the hardwood floors– was a light gray-green. The French Art Deco wooden end tables that Rio had never loved but kept anyway; purchased from EBAY through a very old woman who’d detailed their history in exceptionally unbelievable ways.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes stuck to her side of the room, to <i>her</i> end table.</p><p>Sitting on them was a stack of papers and envelopes clearly opened.</p><p>Her letters.</p><p>“You read them?”</p><p>Rio eyes darted toward the stack, her entire body snapping taut. She looked caught, trapped, and Agatha wished she had just kept her mouth shut. She didn’t want to force Rio into this conversation; she didn’t know if <i>she</i> was ready for this conversation.</p><p>It didn’t seem fair to feel so relieved when Rio had waited five years only to find out Agatha hadn’t opened hers.</p><p>“Rio…” She trailed off, so uncertain and frustrated with herself. “We don’t have to talk about it right now.”</p><p>She stepped closer and Rio’s eyes flashed to hers. That cornered look increased. Rio hated losing control, hated when her emotions overtook her sense, when she was unprepared.</p><p>Agatha reached out and Rio’s hand flashed to her wrist, holding almost painfully tight.</p><p>Rio swallowed, her chest raising and falling sharply.</p><p>Agatha moved into her space anyway, her body responding immediately to the harsh touch, to the tension that sparked in the room. She knew what would help her; but that had been in the past where trust was inherent in every one of their interactions.</p><p>Rio’s pupils expanded at Agatha’s proximity, the muscles in her jaw pronounced as she clenched her teeth.</p><p>Agatha didn’t try to remove her wrist from Rio’s grasp. She reached up with her free hand and brushed Rio’s hair from her face.</p><p>“Do you want–” Agatha’s words were far weaker, raspier, than she’d meant them to be, her pulse pounding in her ears. She felt the jump of anticipation in her gut, the heat that seared through her body. “Would it help if– you can do whatever you need to. I want you to.”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flared as she dragged in another sharp breath. She looked like she might snap, like she might shatter at any moment.</p><p>Agatha knew where to push, how to do it exactly right. The muscle memory eased back into place and she let her fingers slide down to grip Rio’s jaw tightly.</p><p>“Take it, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed, her grip tightening as her other hand pulled Agatha’s from her face and held them between their bodies. Her voice was rough.</p><p>“I was <i>so</i> angry at you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded as the words sank heavy into her skin.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio stared at her, searching for any kind of resistance, any kind of hesitation.</p><p>She wouldn’t find any.</p><p>Rio’s voice remained gravelly, now layered with command.</p><p>“I won’t be gentle.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth watered, her core clenching.</p><p>“I don’t want you to be.”</p><p>That seemed to be enough for her. Rio used her grip to turn Agatha, pulling her back against her chest. Her hands slid under Agatha’s shirt, nails scoring her ribs, before pressing up and palming Agatha’s chest roughly.</p><p>Agatha’s knees nearly gave out. Having Rio touching her again was ecstasy. Her head dropped onto Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Rio moved one of her hands down beneath the hem of her sweatpants. She pressed tightly against Agatha’s cunt, a hiss leaving her mouth.</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>Rio sagged slightly against her, her mouth hot on Agatha’s neck as she bit her teeth into the skin, hard.</p><p>Agatha whimpered, her hands reaching up to sink into Rio’s hair.</p><p>Rio growled irritation into her throat, shifting them until she could press Agatha over the side of the bed. She retracted her hands and pulled Agatha’s from her hair, pressing them into the duvet.</p><p>“Don’t move.”</p><p>Rio’s weight on Agatha’s ass and thighs retreated and Agatha saw Rio move to the bedside table.</p><p>She clenched her fingers in the fabric of the duvet and fought the urge to help, to strip off her shirt, to shove her sweats down her hips.</p><p>She wanted to feel everything against her skin. She wanted the soft slide of fabric against her breasts, the grind of Rio’s hips, the leather of the harness.</p><p>She whined at the thought, her clothing feeling too restricting as Rio walked back behind her.</p><p>Rio’s hands settled on her hips, her fingers curling into the hem and dragging down.</p><p>Cool air slid against Agatha’s skin, against the exposed slick of her core. She pressed her thighs together and Rio kicked one of her feet to the side, spreading her legs wide and leaving her without any friction.</p><p>Agatha’s vision became shades of want, her vision blurry as she pressed back toward Rio and found nothing.</p><p>She couldn’t help it. She lifted her hand from where Rio had placed them and gripped her shirt over her shoulder, intent to rip it off.</p><p>A loud crack sounded through the room, the sound hitting before the sting against her ass.</p><p>Agatha’s arm went limp and fell back, her mouth dropping open as her face pressed into the duvet. She moaned, her eyes closing.</p><p>Rio’s hands slid under her shirt, up her back, and surprisingly– she gave Agatha what she wanted. She pushed Agatha’s shirt over her head but left it to restrict her shoulders.</p><p>“What did I say, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to answer when Rio’s hand struck against the same spot, the pain sharper. Agatha whimpered, her body on fire, her core drenched.</p><p>Another slap, this against the unblemished side. Agatha thought she might come if Rio did it again.</p><p>“Answer me.”</p><p>Agatha whined, finding her voice.</p><p>“You told me not to move.”</p><p>Rio’s hands circled Agatha’s hips and clamped down, digging into her muscle. Rio pulled her back and Agatha felt the head of the silicone slide roughly against her clit.</p><p>It was almost too much. Almost. Rio always played on the right side of Agatha’s pain, always found the pleasure. Agatha’s mouth fell open and she tasted fabric. Rio repeated the motion.</p><p>Rio held it in place this time, the head against Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“That’s right.” She dragged her nails against Agatha’s back, ran the heels of her palms up against the muscles along her spine, and then scratched back down. “You’ve never been a very good listener.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the weak tremble in her limbs, the flex of muscles in her thighs, the prickle on the skin of her ass as it recovered from Rio’s hand.</p><p>Rio hummed dangerously and slid her hand low, slipped her fingers through Agatha’s slick.</p><p>“I don’t know if you’re quite there yet.”</p><p>Agatha cried out desperately as Rio stepped back.</p><p>“I am, Rio–”</p><p>Rio hushed her.</p><p>“Shhh. Turn around, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s body wasn’t complying well with her commands. She felt weak as she pushed herself over.</p><p>Rio loomed over her, entirely bare, the black of the harness standing out against her olive skin. Despite the cool control in her tone, there was a matched desperation in her eyes and Agatha whimpered at the sight of her. She wanted to touch her again.</p><p>Rio stepped further back, her head nodding down.</p><p>“On your knees.”</p><p>A rush of heady, shameless need rocketed through Agatha as she complied immediately, her knees thudding on the carpet, her eyes level with the silicone.</p><p>She reached toward Rio’s hips.</p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Hands behind your back, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s answering movement felt dragged out of her, her hands pressing back, one wrist cinching tightly around the other to keep them in place.</p><p>Only then did Rio step forward, one hand sliding into Agatha’s hair, tightening, the other pressing two fingers between Agatha’s lips. They slipped along Agatha’s tongue and they tasted like her.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were hooded, her mouth parted, her breathing quick. Her voice did not waver.</p><p>“That’s really good, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha moaned around Rio’s fingers, pulling them further into her mouth, pressing her teeth against the knuckles.</p><p>Rio’s smile crept wide, a touch of sincerity flickering before she regained control.</p><p>“Do you want more?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her cheeks hollowing as she sucked Rio’s fingers.</p><p>Rio pulled free, her wet fingertips dragging down Agatha’s chin as she repositioned the cock, the tip of it pressing against Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted again, lips grazing against the head, her tongue darting out to taste it.</p><p>Rio watched.</p><p>She said nothing as Agatha took the shaft of it in her mouth. She said nothing as Agatha’s tongue laved against the silicone.</p><p>As Agatha adjusted, the cock slid deeper, pressing against Agatha’s tongue and lips. She’d nearly taken the full length when Rio’s control snapped.</p><p>She tightened her grasp in Agatha’s hair and jolted her hips forward. Agatha moaned, the sound vibrating enough that Rio seemed to feel it. Her expression went slack as she jogged her hips into Agatha’s face again. The head of it nudged against Agatha’s throat and she gagged slightly. Rio started to pull back, but Agatha followed, her hands dutifully kept in place.</p><p>It was worth not being able to breathe for a moment to hear the groan that left Rio’s lips.</p><p>Rio’s hand in her hair loosened, her fingers stroking down Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha. You look so good like this.”</p><p>Agatha gasped as she drew back, her eyes watering as she pressed forward again.</p><p>She felt hyper-focused now, her eyes on Rio’s as she accustomed herself to the intrusion of the silicone. She reached up boldly and placed Rio’s hand back in her hair.</p><p>It was all the permission Rio needed.</p><p>She fucked into Agatha’s throat, her movements controlled and steady, the force just enough, but not too much.</p><p>Agatha got lost in the rhythm of it, in the way Rio’s eyes locked onto the motion like she was in a trance.</p><p>She was drenched, her legs pressing and grinding together and receiving no friction.</p><p>She was nearly disappointed when Rio reached her breaking point.</p><p>With careful movements, Rio caught Agatha’s jaw and pressed her thumb into her teeth, keeping her jaw open so she could withdraw. She wiped the bits of saliva that had slipped down Agatha’s chin and stepped back.</p><p>“Get up.”</p><p>Agatha stood too quickly, her head going faint for a moment, and Rio reached out to steady her. She looked worried, slipping out of her domineering presence.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t have that. She spoke with a challenge in her eyes.</p><p>“Losing steam, already?” She looked down at the strap. “I remember you having more stamina than that.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw locked. She pressed her palm against Agatha’s chest, pushing her back onto the bed.</p><p>“Did I say you could speak?”</p><p>Agatha whined as Rio folded over her, her fingers sliding up Agatha’s chest and pinching her nipple. The silicone slid through her slick and Agatha wanted to scream when Rio didn’t immediately slip into her.</p><p>The hand on her chest slid up to rest on Agatha’s throat.</p><p>“Do you think you’re ready now?”</p><p>Agatha nodded even as Rio’s fingers pressed into the sides of her neck. She wheezed out a wanton ‘yes,’ but Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Rio looked at her clinically, her gaze roving over, the wrecked state of Agatha’s hair, the red lines from her nails, to the slick between her legs. She returned her attention to Agatha’s face.</p><p>“It doesn’t sound like you are.”</p><p>Agatha nearly cried, her hands circling around Rio’s wrist, pushing her hand into her throat.</p><p>“Please, Rio. I’m ready. Please–”</p><p>Rio tightened her hold on Agatha’s throat, cutting her off, and pressed the head of the cock between Agatha’s folds. There was no resistance as she bottomed out, her hips pressing flush to Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth in a silent scream, her head dropping back as she felt the press against her walls. Her vision pitched as Rio’s grip loosened on her throat. She wrapped her legs around Rio’s back to keep her close and barely had time to breathe before Rio started a brutal pace. She slipped out halfway and rocked back in, the motion wrecking any kind of restraint Agatha had been holding onto.</p><p>The sound that left her lips was nearly pathetic and Rio chased after it, driving harder after every cry.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t think, couldn’t lift her hands from where they were twisted in the duvet, couldn’t drop the arch in her spine. She felt the silicone rut into her, over and over and over until she felt like her pleasure had reached its peak, had surpassed the trigger for her orgasm.</p><p>It didn’t matter. Rio’s was on her, inside her, around her. She would be happy to die like this.</p><p>Rio’s hand, the one anchored to her hip, slid until her palm was pressed against Agatha’s lower abdomen. Her thumb slipped between Agatha’s folds and pressed against her clit.</p><p>Agatha came harder than she remembered ever doing before, the release like a gunshot, the pressure that had built up crackling up her spine and through her veins for several long seconds. She didn’t have the wherewithal to control the sound that left her mouth or worry about the way her hips lifted from the bed, the way Rio’s hands had to catch her and lower her back to the mattress.</p><p>Rio released the harness on her hips and it thudded to the floor as she crawled up beside Agatha.</p><p>Agatha forced movement into her limbs, opened her arms so Rio could press herself close and bury her face into Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s breath against her throat and she closed her eyes.</p><p>“Rio, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Rio’s arms tightened around Agatha’s waist and Agatha held her with her lungs still recovering, her legs boneless against the duvet.</p>

<p>Agatha held Rio for a long while, her body growing cold, her skin prickling with goosebumps. She wouldn’t move until Rio did, content to play with the soft strands of Rio’s hair.</p><p>Rio had curled into her, her knee drawn up over Agatha’s hips, her calf resting between Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Rio’s breathing had eased gradually, but she wasn’t asleep. Her fingers were drawing senseless patterns on Agatha’s sternum, running along her collarbone, skimming against her throat.</p><p>It wasn’t under Agatha felt Rio press closer, her skin pebbled, that she hummed softly.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio sighed.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Agatha slid her hand down Rio’s back and rubbed gently.</p><p>But neither spoke. Words sat heavy on Agatha’s tongue but she couldn’t force them to leave. There was so much fear, so much grief that still clung to her ribs.</p><p>Frustration pushed tears into her eyes and she felt Rio tense.</p><p>With a jarring speed, Rio rolled off of her and settled her feet to the floor.</p><p>“I have an idea.”</p><p>Agatha blinked and watched as Rio walked into the closet. A drawer opened, closed, and she returned with a bundle of clothing in her hands. She lobbed it toward Agatha, the cool material hitting her chest and neck, and Agatha’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Rio–”</p><p>Rio returned to the closet.</p><p>“We’re going for a run.”</p><p>Agatha pushed herself up; the whiplash of Rio fucking her, to Rio curling into her, to Rio’s sudden desire to drag her out of the house and test her knees, was enough to put her on her back foot.</p><p>“I don’t have shoes–”</p><p>Rio returned dressed in leggings and a black hoodie. She dropped a pair of sneakers at Agatha’s feet and sat down to don her own.</p><p>Agatha pulled on her sports bra and tugged the proffered t-shirt over her head. It was worn, the graphic from a band she didn’t recognize, and she glanced over at Rio as she scooted closer to the edge.</p><p>“We’re going for a run?”</p><p>Rio slid her last shoe on and stood with a nod.</p><p>Agatha didn’t ask questions as she trailed after Rio into the kitchen. She didn’t ask questions as Rio handed her a protein bar and a glass of water. She didn’t ask questions as they walked into the front yard, the action so reminiscent of an easier time. She didn’t ask as they stretched, warming up in the chilled air.</p><p>It wasn’t until their feet struck the pavement, their strides matching within moments, that Agatha began to understand.</p><p>Running had gone from competition, to simple maintenance, to an escape over the course of their relationship. When they’d met, it was about the times, about who would cross the finish line first. In their first years together as burgeoning agents, it had been about staying fit, staying on the top of their game. It was something they’d been able to do together.</p><p>After their marriage, after Nicky, it had been about stolen moments to remember themselves, to converse without the nonsensical babblings of their perfect son, to reconnect.</p><p>Sometimes Wanda would swing by on her own errands, and she’d sit with Nicky on the floor as Agatha and Rio desperately sought time for themselves.</p><p>When Nicky was older and they’d taken up a friendship with Mr. O’Malley, Nicky would sit on the porch with him as Agatha and Rio cut very short circles around their block. It had been cute, a high-pitched squeal and cheer from their son every time they rounded the corner.</p><p>Agatha felt the surge of adrenaline, the burn of her thighs and calves, the tinge in her lower back from sleeping on a couch. She pumped her arms and wondered what this would be for them now.</p><p>She glanced at Rio; saw the loose fabric of the sweatshirt move against her small frame with every stride, watched the hairs messily pulled back begin to slip free. Her cheeks were already red from the exertion, from the cold, and suddenly Agatha couldn’t believe she was here. Two days ago she hadn’t been certain if Rio was reading her letters. She hadn’t been sure if it was entirely hopeless. She hadn’t been sure if she’d lost Rio to her own fears and grief.</p><p>To have her within arms reach, to fall into a pastime that had been their saving grace in every period of their lives, Agatha wanted to cry. Again.</p><p>She refocused on the gray of the street under her feet and let herself fall into the rhythm of Rio’s cadence.</p><p>They ran a route Agatha didn’t know, one that veered away from their street, away from what she’d known, and carried them onto a walking path surrounded by thick vegetation and far-reaching trees.</p><p>There were others out and about; a teen walking his dog, a handful of runners, a man looking weary and amused as he walked with a small toddler clinging to one of his legs.</p><p>They ran past a slow-moving stream, crossed a bridge, and started up a brutal hill that had Agatha panting and straining.</p><p>As they crested the top, she groaned.</p><p>“What route from hell is this?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, her effort only visible in the sheen of sweat on her brow and her slightly elevated breathing.</p><p>“We’re only two miles in.”</p><p>Agatha felt her heart rate settle as the path leveled out.</p><p>“If you make me climb another hill I’m going to lay on the ground instead.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip but didn’t answer and Agatha wanted to turned around.</p><p>She didn’t.</p><p>For the next three miles, Agatha climbed absurdly steep hills in borrowed running shoes with a body that was not as young as it had been before, a body that had never quite beat Rio’s predilection for running until you dropped.</p><p>It felt terrible. It felt good. The breeze cut through the building heat around her body, cooling the sweat that was coating her cheeks and forehead and jaw. Everything was stretching, searing, working, and the intense weight of the emotions from the day before, from today, were burned away for the duration.</p><p>They remained on the trail for the third and fourth mile, the path expansive, before Rio steered them up the other side and back onto a familiar road.</p><p>Agatha was too tired, too desperate to be finished, for her to feel any of the grief that licked at her spine.</p><p>They ran left, right, right, and then standing against the gray-blue sky was a park.</p><p>It looked different now, clearly refurbished as things broke, rusted, or were proven to be too dangerous. The dull green and brown from before had been replaced with a bright blue; accents of fiery oranges, reds, lime greens, and purples made the playground pop even with the overcast.</p><p>The wood chips had been replaced with rubber mulch.</p><p>It was empty at the moment, most kids in daycare or school, and Rio didn’t slow until she’d stepped onto the rubbery surface. Agatha’s feet rocked, her jelly legs nearly giving out at the change in texture, and she slowed to a stop with very little control of her body.</p><p>She heaved, her vision pitching, and bent over with her hands on her knees.</p><p>“For.. fucks….sake.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t much better now, her head dropped back, her chest raised, her hands on her hips as she sucked in lungfuls of air.</p><p>Agatha let herself fall onto the mulch, the smell of rubber potent in her nose. She rolled onto her back and kicked her legs out, her arms dropping wide. She stared up at the sky and listened to the beat of her heart in her ears.</p><p>Rio lowered herself down and mirrored Agatha’s position.</p><p>Neither of them spoke for several minutes as their bodies cooled, their sweat drying salty on their skin.</p><p>Agatha reached for where her grief sat and found it soft, pliant. It usually rested like a stone, lodged uncomfortably between her ribs and pressing against her heart.</p><p>She closed her eyes as the dam broke.</p><p>“If you had asked me– from the moment I met you, to the moments before we discovered Nicky was sick– what I saw for the rest of my life. I would have said ‘you.’” She didn’t look over at Rio. “I never thought I’d spend more than a few days apart from you. Never wanted to.”</p><p>To her relief, Rio didn’t respond and didn't interrupt.</p><p>Agatha had so much to say and she wasn’t sure she could start again if stopped.</p><p>“We had become this unflinching, unbreakable unit. Just you, Nicky, and me. I thought so much about the future, about the years we’d have together. I had so much hope, Rio. Even days before his death, I still hoped.” Agatha’s nose burned. “I know that it was useless. Impossible. But I thought if anyone in the world deserved to keep their baby, if anyone had suffered enough, had acquired enough of a karmic backlog, it would have been us.”</p><p>Agatha barely felt the chill leeching her warmth from the rubber mulch.</p><p>“Even though we were falling apart, even though both of us were wrecking one another, I still hoped. Because I knew if Nicky was around we could work our way back to each other. We could forgive one another for the hurt and the anger we inflicted. I didn’t want to consider that I was losing you too, that every time I reached out you turned away. So I put all of myself into the life of our son.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed tightly.</p><p>“The day Nicky died; that shattering of hope? All I could feel was loss, all I could remember was the way we spoke to one another, the way we hated each other. I was sick with this thing in my chest that felt like truth. I know now it was despair. But I felt sicker and sicker and sicker until I couldn’t breathe in the air that still smelled like the three of us. I couldn’t look at our photos, I couldn’t lay beside you in bed and not touch you, I couldn’t hold his stuffed rabbit knowing he never would again.” Agatha clenched her teeth a moment to stem any tears. “And you didn’t say <i>anything.</i>” Agatha felt the touch of anger and shook her head. “I’m sorry–”</p><p>Rio finally spoke and Agatha could tell by her voice she was looking at the same sky.</p><p>“You don’t– You shouldn’t apologize for being angry, Agatha. I shouldn’t have let you carry the weight of this alone, as if I hadn’t been a cause of our fracturing. I was so mad that you didn’t read my letters even though a part of me understands. Because I know you. And I have always seen you for who you are. But if we’re talking about before you left? Agatha, I did everything I could to take away your hope because it was killing me to know that you were wrong. It wasn’t intentional.” Rio sighed. “I hated that you could still feel it. I thought you were being belligerently naive. I thought you were being a coward, making me carry the weight of what was coming alone.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest ached.</p><p>“I was.”</p><p>Rio’s voice was sharp.</p><p>“No. You weren’t. You were doing everything you could to cope with our son’s suffering. You were doing what you needed to to be happy for him, to give him everything he could have wanted in his final months.”</p><p>The sky went blurry in Agatha’s vision and she hadn’t realized how much she’d needed to hear that.</p><p>Rio continued softer.</p><p>“You loved Nicky so devoutly, so fervently, sometimes he didn’t even realize he was sick. You never let him sit in his pain, never let him cry alone, never gave him a reason to be afraid. You were unbelievable, Agatha. You were superhuman. You’d sleep for three hours and then spend the entire day taking him to his appointments and talking him through things children should never have to experience. You’d wear your happiest smile and play make-believe and make him laugh through his tears. You’d spend all of your energy and then you’d find more because, to you, there was no other choice.”</p><p>Rio’s next words wavered.</p><p>“It took me two years of therapy to understand that the way we handled Nicky’s sickness, the way we turned on each other, came from being entirely depleted. We fell into our poorest habits because every ounce of energy we spent was on our son.”</p><p>Agatha was openly crying now and her throat ached terribly. It was so different hearing it from Rio. Wanda had told her. Alder had told her. But Rio’s words struck every nerve and burrowed themselves in her chest.</p><p>She pressed a hand over her eyes.</p><p>“I promised you we’d handle everything together and then I left you.”</p><p>Rio’s cold fingers settled in Agatha’s hand, her thumb brushing lightly against her skin.</p><p>“And I promised I would never shut you out. You’re not the only one who faltered.”</p><p>The quiet fell again, both of them feeling the magnitude of this conversation, the uncertainty.</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“Rio, I don’t want to push and I don’t want to overstep, but–” She finally looked over. “Is there a path forward where we can try this again?”</p><p>Rio eyes met hers.</p><p>“It’s–”</p><p>Their phones went off in unison, the twin buzz narrowing the possible reasons to one.</p><p>Agatha’s chest froze at the lack of answer, at the question hanging in the air. She pressed her phone to her ear.</p><p>“Harkness.”</p><p>It was Wanda.</p><p>
<i>”The DOE just reported that a shipment of cesium-137 has gone missing. It was being transported from a facility in Maryland to a nuclear waste site in Virginia and it never arrived at its destination. We need all hands on.”</i>
</p><p>“I’m on my way in.”</p><p>Rio was having a similar conversation, her face severe.</p><p>There was no time for anything else as they both pushed to their feet and began to jog the much faster route back to the house.</p><p>Agatha grabbed her go-bag from her car and changed in the living room while Rio was upstairs.</p><p>As they stepped outside, Rio locking the door, Agatha hesitated just once. She reached out, wrapped her arms around Rio’s shoulders, and pulled her against her body. It was quick, a poor goodbye, and then both of them were on the move again.</p><p>Agatha tried to generate enough energy to focus on the job but her mind kept returning to words left unsaid, to a question left unanswered. She clenched her hands on the wheel and flew through traffic with her lights and siren blazing. Rio was behind her, two SUVs weaving as they made their way to the WFO.</p><p>They parked and ran side by side into the chaos.<br/>
____</p><p>Agatha took the time from garage to elevator to pull herself into the agent she needed to be. Rio entered beside her, already back on her phone as she coordinated. It felt wrong, leaving the space they’ve found for themselves, ending it on a half-finished conversation. But that was the job. It had always been the job.</p><p>Agatha stepped into their team’s operations room to find the others already there. All five of them were looking intently at the four screens set before them.</p><p>Wanda glanced up and stood, walking over.</p><p>“Hey, I’m sorry–”</p><p>Agatha laughed.</p><p>“Unless you stole a truckload of radioactive material, I don’t think apologies are in order.”</p><p>She moved around the screens to see the security feed from what looked like a medical lab. The letters RRIM stood bold, ‘Radiation Research Institute of Maryland’ was written out below it.</p><p>Wanda stopped beside her.</p><p>“So far, we know the transport was carrying decommissioned blood irradiators, gamma irradiators, calibration sources, and a few waste drums. Total amount of Cs-137 is expected to be around 500 grams.”</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“I’m assuming that is worse than it sounds.”</p><p>Alice chuckled dryly.</p><p>“General exposure could cause irreparable harm or death to thousands. If used in a dirty bomb, that increases to tens of thousands.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“Jesus Christ.” She flipped through the pages in front of William and frowned. “Why was this much radioactive material in the hands of civilian contractors?”</p><p>Lilia pointed at Agatha.</p><p>“Exactly. Which brings me back to what I was saying.” She moved around the table to face them and slapped an article down. “Usually equipment like this is decommissioned over time. The replacements; x-ray based and electron beam therapies are slowly replacing this older equipment, but the initial cost of these machines is extensive to an organization that gets most of its funding from grants, private investors, and government agencies.” She flipped to another article. “Especially if such an institution has lost trust due to a recent scandal.”</p><p>Agatha reached over and took the page as William’s hand landed on it. She squinted at the fine print.</p><p>“You could have made this easier to read.”</p><p>William spoke under his breath.</p><p>“I didn’t have an issue seeing it.”</p><p>Agatha felt the tug of a grin, the flow, the chirps, the work: it was bringing her down from the elevated levels of emotion that had been coursing through her for days. Not that she would say that. She read even though it strained her.</p><p>“Data Falsification and Radiation Overdose in Pediatric Trial Exposed.” She continued reading, her expression hardening. “The trial, which used cesium-137 radiation therapy, has sparked widespread outrage after it was discovered that the research team, under pressure to produce rapid results, deliberately altered patient data and exposed vulnerable children to toxic levels of radiation.”</p><p>Lilia tapped the article still on the table.</p><p>“Doctor Faith Wilden and the Head of the Radiology Oncology department were both fired and are in an ongoing criminal trial. They’re looking at fraud, endangerment, and medical malpractice. There are over one hundred civil lawsuits that have been filed.”</p><p>Jen shook her head.</p><p>“What are you getting at, Lilia?”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes gleamed.</p><p>“The institute has been aggressive in its efforts to regain public and private approval. They’ve restructured their leadership, their protocols and safety procedures received a massive overhaul. They put out a public statement, saying they would be moving away from radioactive therapies. This was two years ago. During that time, they’ve floundered. They haven’t been able to find the backing to actually make the switch.”</p><p>She revealed her last article.</p><p>“Two months ago, a private, anonymous donor provided them the funding to purchase the new equipment.” She tapped the page. “This is the thread I suggest we follow.”</p><p>William’s eyes widened.</p><p>“You think the donor organized this?”</p><p>Agatha hummed.</p><p>“Maybe not organized, but this timeline is… conspicuous.” She narrowed her eyes at Lilia. “Did you suddenly get smarter while I was away?”</p><p>Lilia laughed.</p><p>“Good to see you too, Harkness.”</p><p>Wanda stepped forward.</p><p>“We’re working in tandem with local law enforcement, and there are two other teams here that’ll be working different angles from this case. Director Vidal will be running point on this until we reacquire the missing shipment.”</p><p>Agatha felt herself slip for a moment, her mind careening back toward the points of reconnection, the physicality that had returned so easily, the words that had taken a five mile run to even access. The answer that she desperately needed from Rio. Even if it was ‘maybe.’ Even if it was ‘not right now. Even if it was ‘no.’</p><p>She blinked back to the present as Wanda changed the images on the four screens to one. It revealed two men, both in their mid-thirties.</p><p>“One of the civilian contractors, Melik Levan, was shot and killed on the scene. The other, Lenny Hartwin, has been missing since. His wife said he has not contacted her.” She flipped to another photo, this one older but clearly related to Levan. “Melik Levan’s brother, Kerem, has already been notified. He’s giving the detectives a hard time.” She nodded to Alice. “Gulliver, Kale, I need both of you to speak with him and see if there’s something he’s reluctant to share.”</p><p>The screen changed to an image of a family, Lenny Hartwin standing beside a woman and two children. Wanda continued.</p><p>“We need eyes and ears in their home. It’s possible Hartwin is in on this, but it’s just as likely that he’s a victim and needs our help. Calderu, I think you’re our best bet to get answers here without aggravating the family.”</p><p>Wanda had just changed the image to the research institute when Rio stepped into their room, her expression severe. She drew to a stop beside Wanda and waited for her to finish.</p><p>Agatha only stared for a moment before her attention was drawn to the eyes of her teammates. A look passed between them, a quick set of shared glances, and Agatha’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Wanda continued.</p><p>“I’m heading to the crash site with Harkness to see if there’s anything the police missed. Due to the extreme nature of this case, Director Vidal is spearheading the investigation at the institute. William, I’d like you to accompany her.”</p><p>Another rustle went through the team and Lilia cleared her throat.</p><p>“William, weren’t you just saying you wanted more hands-on experience at crime scenes?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed further until they were slits. She saw the confusion slip to realization on his face and he nodded solemnly.</p><p>“I– yes. I haven’t actually gotten to experience a real crime scene.” He was a very bad liar. “Since I am– well I still have consultant status. So technically– well, if that’s okay with you–”</p><p>Rio stepped in before he could trip any harder over his own feet.</p><p>“You should get to learn about every aspect of this job before committing yourself to it. Wanda, take Kaplan.” She looked toward Agatha, a barely there smile in her eyes. “Harkness can accompany me to the Institute. We might need to apply some pressure.”</p><p>Wanda nodded and met Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“We’re rolling out in five.” She stopped closer to Agatha. “A word?”</p><p>Agatha followed after with a final look at Rio where she was pulled into a conversation by Lilia. She stepped into her own office and Wanda closed the door.</p><p>Wanda reached out, a hand against her wrist.</p><p>“Are you okay, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, then hesitated and sighed.</p><p>“I am. Mostly. I should have reached out to let you–”</p><p>Wanda waved her off.</p><p>“I have access to your location. I knew you were with Rio. I didn’t expect that you were going to stay.”</p><p>Agatha let out a dry huff.</p><p>“We’ll revisit that first claim at a later time.” She leaned against her desk and felt the topsy-turvy sway of emotion sink against her chest. “I didn’t expect to stay. I was just– she asked me to come inside. I couldn’t say no to her. I didn’t want to.”</p><p>Wanda had somehow removed every trace of Agent Maximoff and replaced her with the woman who had been Agatha’s ride-or-die for years.</p><p>“Of course you didn’t. It’s Rio.”</p><p>It was said as if it was the simplest thing in the world. As if Agatha choosing Rio was the only thing that made sense.</p><p>Agatha looked down. Of course. <i>Of course.</i> Because Agatha always chose Rio. Until she’d stopped. Now there was a desperate need to have that option available to her again.</p><p>Wanda sighed.</p><p>“I want to ask so much more but we need to go. Are you going to be okay working with her?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, a smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>“I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her demeanor shifting toward professional. She paused as she opened the door.</p><p>“I’m really fucking proud of you, Agatha.”<br/>
______</p><p>Agatha didn’t consider the repercussions of being alone with Rio until she’d sealed the car door behind her, dulling the sounds of the parking garage and the hum of the engine.</p><p>They were at work. They were managing a serious crisis. They needed to stay focused. It wasn’t the time to seek answers, to compromise their careers for a conversation that needed time and space to be had correctly.</p><p>So Agatha stewed in it until Rio broke the silence.</p><p>“Your intern is a poor liar. Are we sure he’s agent material?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, the tension in her chest easing. If they were on the same page, if they could just talk like… friends. They’d be fine. Even if that seemed both too much and not enough.</p><p>“That was– I don’t know what that was. Scheming, probably.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her.</p><p>“Scheming?”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow.</p><p>“My mother dropped a lot of personal trauma in her few moments speaking before you punched her in the face.”</p><p>Rio huffed.</p><p>“I didn’t punch her in the face.” She paused, then; “I should have. She still would have taken it and left.”</p><p>“Do I need to do my own investigative work to figure out what you have over her or are you going to tell me?”</p><p>Rio stared out at the traffic, horns blaring as people tried to beat the upcoming rush.</p><p>“Do you remember the last time she visited?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched.<br/>
____</p><p>
<i>Agatha woke to a pounding on the front door, the sound incessant and carrying a weighty sense of dread she couldn’t place. She sat up just as Nicky started to wail.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was rolling to her feet already, the motion practiced from his current stint of rising at ungodly hours.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ll get him, love. Go back to sleep.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was already standing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Somebody’s at the door, Rio.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s sleepy demeanor sloughed away, her eyes far more alert.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was already in her robe and moving toward the hallway.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ll handle them into an early fucking grave. This was the first time in two weeks Nicky slept past four am.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stomped down the stairs, waiting until she heard Nicky’s cries easing, Rio having reached him, before yanking open the front door that was still under assault.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She nearly got knuckles against her face and her instincts kicked into overdrive as she knocked the wrist away sharply.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She wished she had hit harder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Evanora was standing on her front steps in her Sunday best, her skirt over her knees and her tights dull and pristine.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rocked back, her heart dropping through the floor as she stared at the severe, aged face of her mother.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What are you doing here?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Evanora’s face twitched in disapproval, her hands clasped in front of her like the most pious of nuns.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Now, Agatha–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had lived her life in fear of this woman. There was nothing to be afraid of now.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I told you last time you darkened my doorstep that I did not want to see you. If you’re going to resort to such measures to stalk and harass my family, I’ll happily file a restraining order.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Evanora’s calm fractured as it always did in conversations with Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You spoiled, iniquitous child. I am here as a messenger and I will not be swayed–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha closed the door in her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The resounding thud of the door slamming in Evanora’s face filled Agatha with a high that lasted all of three seconds as Nicky began to cry again. The sound was high, sharp, and Agatha knew her mother heard it through the door.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She began to pound again, this time her words carrying the vitriol she always carried in her heart.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Have you been so heedless?” More pounding. “Agatha! You are spurning God’s outstretched hand once more! You are bedding the devil and bearing him children to sicken and corrupt the world!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Evanora’s tirade continued and Agatha, despite the security she’d found in Rio, had always been bendable to her mother’s words. It was her greatest flaw, one she loathed and railed against to seemingly no effect.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She could imagine her mother’s spittle flying in her rage, imagine the hand that would raise to strike her, imagine the dark, soulless room her mother had made for her until she could earn back her measly personal items through prayer and penance.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s chest felt chokingly tight, her eyes unseeing as they stared at the floor.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“–repent! Your life of sin, your love of what is evil, has twisted you into a servant of the dark. How can you not see, Agatha! Open this door!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>And then Nicky was crying again, and footsteps were thundering down the steps, and Rio was standing in front of her and holding both sides of her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her hands were gentle, her thumbs sliding along Agatha’s temples. She spoke softly, so much softer than Evanora’s screeching, but Agatha heard only her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Go upstairs with Nicky, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha listened because it was her only recourse, it was like a path through suffocating vines.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She lifted Nicky from his crib and held him close; the black around her vision fading as she looked down at her son.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was gone for long enough that Agatha wondered what she could be saying. She hoped it would be enough even if it never had been before.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The shouting had stopped, the pounding on the door had ceased.</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time the door to the nursery opened, Nicky had fallen asleep in Agatha’s arms and Agatha was close behind him.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked adorably disheveled. Her t-shirt was hanging from one of her shoulders and her sweatpants were clearly on backwards. She searched every part of Agatha’s face as she approached, her own laced with concern. She knelt down beside the chair and carefully slowed Agatha’s rocking to a standstill.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her fingers circled around Agatha’s bicep.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“She’s not coming back, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wanted to believe it, but she’d thought that before. Her mother always found a way to drag her down in the happiest moments of her life.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hand tightened, her eyes becoming more insistent.</i>
</p><p><i>“She is not coming back.”</i><br/>
____</p><p>Agatha hummed softly.</p><p>“She never did come back.”</p><p>Rio’s hands tightened on the wheel.</p><p>“I had talked to her two times before that. The first, where I tried to reason with her, to understand her. That was quickly proven to be an error in judgement. The second, when she showed up after we moved in together. You were so upset you drove until you ran out of gas.”</p><p>“You offered to kill her.”</p><p>Rio nodded, a smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>“I think I meant it. I’d never wanted to hurt anyone more.” She shrugged. “But I loved my job. And you. I didn’t want to lose that. Anyway, I had far more access as an agent. I called in a few favors, did some research, and started picking apart the lives of every person around her. I went to your hometown when I found something concrete and gathered my own evidence.”</p><p>Agatha turned toward her, brows raised.</p><p>“You found something that actually mattered to her?”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips.</p><p>“She was, well, she is, sleeping with the priest at St. Anthony’s. And the good priest happened to be embezzling money from the church.”</p><p>Agatha gaped. Her eyes were wide as she stared at the side of Rio’s face in shock.</p><p>“What?!” Agatha sat back, entirely reeling and failing to process the information for several long seconds. “I– Jesus. I don’t even know–” Agatha fell silent again. “Wait, you’ve known about this for ten years? Why didn’t you tell me? Actually, never mind. Why didn’t you have him arrested? Reveal the information. Ruin her image?” Agatha was close to submitting her own smear ad in the papers. She frowned, then sighed. “You can’t now. It’s mutually assured destruction because you punched her.”</p><p>Rio sat through Agatha’s revelation calmly, a smile twitching at her lips, and Agatha had missed that. The way Rio liked to withhold just the smallest piece of information because she knew Agatha liked a dramatic reveal. She knew Rio enjoyed it just as much, even if she denied it.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat.</p><p>“One, I didn’t <i>punch</i> her. Two, that wasn’t the first time I’d slapped Evanora in the face.”</p><p>Agatha felt like <i>she’d</i> been punched.</p><p>“You slapped my mother when she came to the house?”</p><p>Rio shifted.</p><p>“She said something I didn’t like.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart warmed, her palms aching to reach out and touch Rio.</p><p>“Rio, she was constantly saying things you didn’t like.”</p><p>“This was different. But I had already calmly explained why she would never be returning. She escalated. I calmed her back down.”</p><p>Agatha felt insane. She dropped her head back and laughed, her smile wider than it had been in ages. Rio always called it ‘her smile.’ Agatha looked at Rio, and Rio looked like she was thinking exactly that.</p><p>“I can’t believe you’ve gotten to hit Evanora Harkness. Do you know how many people would kill for that pleasure?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, chuckling, then her expression tightened.</p><p>“She shouldn’t have come back.” She pressed her palms against the wheel. “She thought that our separation meant I wouldn’t be there to protect you. She won’t make that mistake again.”</p><p>The harsh certainty, the layers of devotion coating her words, made Agatha swallow tightly. A word caught her attention.</p><p>“Separation?”</p><p>Suddenly the car jolted to a stop. Rio tugged the door handle.</p><p>“We’re here.” She stepped out of the vehicle, her eyes meeting Agatha’s. “Try to keep the dialogue friendly. But if they’re not cooperating, feel free to be your charming self.”</p><p>Agatha had barely been paying attention, the trip a series of increasingly absurd revelations that she would be thinking about for weeks. She straightened her blazer, rolled her neck, and stepped out of the car to walk toward the front doors of the Radiation Research Institute of Maryland.</p><p>The building was massive and had likely once been a focal point of the surrounding area. Now, the imposing, window-covered building had clear signs of aging and lack of attention. The statement glass was now faded, the landscaping was bare in some spots, overgrown in others, the pavement of the sidewalk was wide but had cracks splitting down most of its sections.</p><p>Agatha fell in line with Rio as they approached. The automatic doors whirred to life, the movement slow, the machinery too loud, and they stepped inside.</p><p>It was quieter than expected, the stone and hardwood floor both scratched or deteriorating.</p><p>The air had a strange smell, like heavy cleaner and mildew combined, and Agatha grimaced.</p><p>The lobby was too large for the single person sitting behind the far counter. A man in his mid-forties with a head full of curly, black hair and a name tag that said “Sampson.”</p><p>“Welcome to RRIM! How can I direct you?”</p><p>Rio pulled out her badge.</p><p>“Special Agents Vidal and Harkness. We’re here to speak with Director Graves.”</p><p>The attendant’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Oh, Mr. Graves has asked not to be interrupted today…”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Say it any more like a question and I’ll assume you’re not certain and find him myself.”</p><p>The man hesitated and Rio smiled disarmingly.</p><p>“Please alert Director Graves that the FBI would like to see him. If he makes us come back with a warrant, we’ll make sure there’s a show for the press.”</p><p>Sampson nodded and immediately picked up the phone.</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha.</p><p>“I do remember saying ‘if they aren’t cooperating.’”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“Maybe I should have slapped him. It’s apparently the most efficient way to get what you want.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled up slightly as she refocused her attention on the attendant.</p><p>He hung up the phone.</p><p>“Twelfth floor. His assistant will take you to him.”</p><p>Rio nodded, already moving toward the elevators, and Agatha followed behind her.</p><p>As they stepped inside, Rio lifted a brow.</p><p>“I’m sure I don’t have to tell you that you can’t slap anyone while we’re here?”</p><p>Agatha leaned on the opposite wall to Rio.</p><p>“You might have to remind me depending on how irritating this Graves is.”</p><p>Rio huffed.</p><p>“Incredibly so. He was one of two Chief Scientific Officers during the scandal. Every conversation with him was like a poorly executed power play on his part. He thinks he’s smarter than he is and he thinks everyone should know.”</p><p>Agatha groaned as the elevator doors opened. She didn’t question Rio’s involvement with the last case.</p><p>A young man with round, wire-rimmed glasses stood at attention.</p><p>“Welcome to RRIM, agents. Director Graves will see you in his office.”</p><p>Agatha glanced around, noting the dozens of offices on this floor, only about a quarter looking like they were filled. Some were lifeless but entirely furnished, others held desks but no computers, and still others were entirely empty. Old name plates sat on some of the doors and Agatha slowed to peer at them as they walked down a long hallway.</p><p>Their shoes stuck slightly to the linoleum and made a catching sound with every step. The assistant slowed outside of a very large, well-maintained office.</p><p>“Let me know if there’s anything I can offer you. Coffee? Tea?”</p><p>Rio waved him off and stepped inside the office.</p><p>It was as Agatha expected it to be. Dark woods, black and silver accents, a massive shelf of awards sitting against the wall beside the massive desk. Sitting in an ergonomic chair was an incredibly tall man with paper-white skin and blonde hair. He was wearing a doctor’s coat and had a button-up blue shirt and a striped tie underneath.</p><p>He smiled and his teeth were perfect, likely veneers if the unnatural white meant anything. He stood and held out his hand, shaking both of theirs.</p><p>“Welcome! Welcome! Agent Vidal, it’s great to see you again. Time has been good to you!”</p><p>Rio offered a tight smile.</p><p>“Patrick, I’m sure you know why we’re here.”</p><p>Agatha noted the subtle shift in his face at the use of his first name.</p><p>He nodded, his frown forced.</p><p>“Of course. Terrible incident. Why anyone would want old medical equipment, I don’t know. Half of it wasn’t even running.” He sat down. “Please, take a seat.”</p><p>Rio remained standing and Graves adjusted awkwardly in his chair as if he wasn’t sure if he needed to stand back up.</p><p>“We’re here to ask a few questions related to the attack.”</p><p>Graves held out his hands.</p><p>“Agent Vidal, I assure you nobody here–”</p><p>Rio interrupted smoothly, her tone entirely polite, her face anything but.</p><p>“Patrick, I don’t think we want a repeat of our last encounter. It’s unlikely to end any better for you. We can skip you being purposefully obtuse, and you can skip the public embarrassment of us searching your office and home once we obtain a warrant.” She grimaced. “I still can’t unsee those–”</p><p>Grave’s stood again, his face hot, the red trailing from his cheeks to his neck.</p><p>“Fine! What, what can I possibly offer you?”</p><p>Rio smiled like a shark and Agatha’s stomach fluttered. She hadn’t seen this version of Rio in a very long time. Director Vidal was an oppressive force, a figurehead to be respected, but Agent Vidal was a predator. She knew where to push, how to pull, to get information. In some ways, she was better than even Agatha. Her irritation rarely showed, her faćade never cracked.</p><p>Agatha often succeeded through tactical risks, through only prods and pokes and shoves. It was hard for a lot of people to stay strong when being absolutely dismantled to the point of tears. It was all bite, all tenacity.</p><p>Rio was precise. Rio was an artist.</p><p>She finally sat down.</p><p>“I need the name of your anonymous donor and I want the name of every person in your facility that had contact with them in any way. I want access to your documents on this disposal transport and I’ll need to speak with your Logistics and Disposal Officer. I also want access to your employee files to see if there are any strange connections or patterns.”</p><p>Patrick dropped back in his chair, and Agatha wanted to laugh at the fact that Rio had made him change levels three separate times since entering the room.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“This is ridiculous. You need a warrant for all of this!”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“That’s fine. We can sit here and wait until we get that squared away. This is a case of high-priority. I’m sure it’ll come through within a few hours.”</p><p>Patrick’s hand shook as he reached for his phone.</p><p>“My assistant can take you to the Disposal Officer on shift. I’ll put together the documents you requested.”</p><p>Rio smiled.</p><p>“I’ll wait right here with you.” She glanced at Agatha, eyes sparkling. “You good with the Disposal Officer?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and tried not to linger on the confidence– bordering on cockiness– in Rio’s eyes.</p><p>She stepped from the room and followed the assistant as he guided her into the elevator.<br/>
_____</p><p>Agatha took a slow breath as they exited the facility together. They’d applied the necessary pressure, most of that pressure coming from Rio, and were currently walking to her car with two boxes filled with employee files and a flash drive.</p><p>“I think William would have learned a lot more coming here to experience you dismantling Mr. Graves.”</p><p>Rio popped the trunk and they slid the items inside. She lifted a brow.</p><p>“You’re saying you didn’t learn anything?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, her stomach buzzing again. It felt like they were in a strange limbo; they could engage more than before, talk to one another without it leading to bloodshed, but there was still this lingering chasm of unspoken words sitting between them.</p><p>She climbed into the passenger seat, veering away from Rio’s question.</p><p>“The Disposal Officer was defensive but I don’t think she was hiding anything. There were no last-minute changes to the route and no unauthorized logins to the shipment database. She may have motive if we find out she’s in any kind of financial trouble, but I think we turn our attention elsewhere.”</p><p>Rio nodded, backing out of the parking spot.</p><p>“I spoke with the head of security after I got what I needed from Graves. Gillian Rourke. She gave me the list of employees that would have had access to the shipment database and the pre-planned route. Nobody accessed the disposal records outside of normal hours and there were no glaring security breaches leading up to this attack.” Rio frowned. “There has to be something in here. There’s no way this was pulled off without somebody in that building lending a helping hand.”</p><p>Agatha was inclined to agree.</p><p>“Any chance it could have been Graves?”</p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>“No, Graves is a snake but he has no venom.”</p><p>“What happened last time that he didn’t want you to bring up?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, her lips curling like the memory was easy to recall.</p><p>“He was trying to protect his boss at the time, I think. He said something along the lines of–” Rio’s voice deepened, taking on a shockingly accurate cadence. “‘If one cannot take risks, one cannot make breakthroughs. Society has chosen to demonize progress.’ I’ll never forget his face when we showed up at his home with a warrant and a tactical team. We searched and found nothing incriminating, but he had a pretty interesting set-up at his bedside.</p><p>“I was the first in the room and he must have been in the middle of using it because it had…” Rio winced. “fluids. But it was one of those sex machines? He kept calling it his ‘thruster’ like he might desensitize it for the eight people forced to lay eyes on it.”</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“Oh my god. I wish you had mentioned it in his office. I have so many questions.”</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>“You would have made him cry. He would have refused to help us.”</p><p>Agatha waved her hand dismissively.</p><p>“Some things are more important than locating stolen radioactive material that could level DC.”</p><p>“I’ll have Wanda make a note of that in your employee file.” Rio’s smile steadied, her mind returning to the case as she exited the highway. “When I pushed Graves for their lack of a thorough check on their anonymous donor, he said that the facility was in bad shape and they were considering closing the doors. He accepted the money because they needed it and didn’t ask questions because he had no other option.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“Sounds like they should have just taken the loss. This is going to get out. Any remaining trust and funding will get pulled when the public discovers that the institute's negligence put their lives at risk.”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“I’m hoping we close this out before the public gets word.”<br/>
_____</p><p>Agatha stared at the screens currently playing four separate news channels as they returned to the room. Will and Wanda were the only ones back.</p><p>Headlines like, <i>Truck Carrying Cesium-137 Hijacked; One Driver Dead, One Missing</i>, <i>Hazardous Materials Shipment Hijacked: Authorities Seek Missing Driver</i>, <i>Authorities Searching for Stolen Radioactive Material After Highway Attack.</i></p><p>None of it was great, all of it would spark panic.</p><p>But the worst was on the fourth screen.</p><p>
<i>Experts Weigh In: How Dangerous Is the Stolen Cesium-137?</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We turn now to Dr. Halperin, a nuclear security analyst, for insight.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“‘Cesium-137 is an incredibly dangerous isotope. In the wrong hands, just a few grams could be used to contaminate an entire city block or even disrupt critical infrastructure. If dispersed into the water supply, it could cause long-term radiation poisoning with effects lasting for generations."</i>
</p><p>Rio’s expression shuttered, her eyes narrowing. She looked at Wanda.</p><p>“Get me our press liaisons. I want a team working on getting this misinformation corrected as soon as possible.”</p><p>She stepped away and put her phone to her ear as Wanda did the same.</p><p>Agatha walked to Will. He looked scared, his eyes staring at the screen as the so-called-expert prattled on, and Agatha stepped forward and muted it.</p><p>“What’s being reported isn’t accurate. It’s an attention-grab at best, fear-mongering at worst. It’ll get straightened out.”</p><p>Will nodded, his hands fiddling with the edge of the table.</p><p>“I know. But my parents called and they’re scared. Wanda said I couldn’t tell them anything.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“The risk posed by you giving your family information they aren’t privy to can cause panic. It could compromise the case or be an abuse of power. Not to mention that your career would be over before it began.” Agatha sat beside him. “This is one of the ethical challenges that comes from our job. But, I can tell you this: out of one every hundred cases like this, ninety-five are solved without issue. This is why we try to keep it out of the public eye.”</p><p>William settled in his seat, his face taking on a serious lilt as he refocused.</p><p>“Did you guys find anything at the institute?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“Nothing substantial. Not yet. But we have a lot to get through. What about the crime scene?”</p><p>Will turned his computer toward her.</p><p>“It was a professional hit. Well-planned. The attack happened on a remote stretch of the route, a single-lane road cutting through several farms. There were spike strips thrown across right before the truck passed. It looks like five to six individuals moved in from the fields on either side. No cameras, no eye-witnesses. The casings at the scene were from a nine millimeter and a .38 special. Wanda thinks that the attackers never intended to fire. That the driver shot first and they ended up killing him. They moved quickly and their getaway vehicle was equipped to handle such sensitive materials.”</p><p>Agatha tapped her fingers, eyes on the bloodstained pavement on William’s screen.</p><p>“If they weren’t going to kill anyone, they may have been trying to keep this low profile.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“Many possibilities. Could’ve been that they weren’t aware how much cesium was in the truck. Or they did and they still thought it wouldn’t bring attention immediately.” Agatha puckered her lips. “It’s also possible that whomever is pulling these strings is an extremist. They might have a specific target and they protect life in certain contexts when they aren’t a part of the greater picture.”</p><p>William’s cheeks puffed out.</p><p>“This job is insane.”</p><p>Agatha clapped his shoulder.</p><p>“Can’t argue there.” She stood, nodding toward the boxes they’d brought back from the institute. “Come on. We might as well be useful until we get our next marching orders.”<br/>
____</p><p>
<i>A man sat primly in front of the seal, his face trustworthy and open, his voice smooth and admonishing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It was in poor taste for Dr. Halperin to share sensationalized misinformation with a clear expertise. Many of his claims were exaggerated, misleading, or speculative. Some were simply untrue. Cesium-137 is dangerous in large quantities but the amount acquired is not capable of leveling a city. It will not pollute the water supply nor cause lasting effects for generations. Cesium-137 is water soluble and would dilute rapidly before it became highly dangerous. As for the high demand on the black market–”</i>
</p><p>Agatha watched the liaison as activity swarmed around where she and William sat looking through the employee files.</p><p>Rio was speaking closely with a very familiar blonde and Agatha felt a flash of embarrassment slip through her as she remembered the rather dramatic encounter on the trail. She kept her head down in an effort to stay out of sight.</p><p>William set another file aside.</p><p>“Why is this information not digital?”</p><p>Agatha opened a new employee file.</p><p>“It is. But some of these are from older employees who left before the files left paper. They weren’t entered into the system. We asked for everything in case a previous employee sticks out.”</p><p>Jennifer and Alice moved through the crowded operations room and settled across from them.</p><p>Jennifer grimaced.</p><p>“I prefer when our space is our space. Why can’t they film the rebuttals in the media room?”</p><p>Agatha smirked.</p><p>“They heard about your pathological need for attention and wanted to oblige you. I think they’re waiting for you on camera two.”</p><p>Kale rolled her eyes.</p><p>Alice diverted the conversation.</p><p>“Anyway. Kerem was pretty resistant to conversation. But it didn’t seem to stem from guilt. We were able to get him to answer our questions after talking in circles for thirty minutes.” She pulled a baggie from her coat and set it on the table. A phone sat inside. “I’m taking it to tech, but Kerem says that he received a voicemail from Melik two days before the transport. Melik said he felt uneasy; that somebody had reached out to him about the shipment. We’re tracking the number now but I imagine it’ll come from a burner.” She sat down. “Anyone get anything useful?”</p><p>A series of head shakes followed and Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Anyone heard from Calderu?”</p><p>William nodded.</p><p>“She spoke with Wanda about an hour ago. She said she thinks there’s something there. The wife is nervous. She got spooked when one of her kids said something about ‘daddy talking to work friends a lot.’”</p><p>Agatha picked up half of their stack and set it in front of Jennifer and Alice.</p><p>“Might as well–”</p><p>Wanda’s phone rang and she answered.</p><p>“Calderu.” She put the phone on the table. “You’re on speaker.”</p><p>
<i>”I do love an audience.” The sounds of traffic could be heard in the background. “The mother finally broke. She said that Lenny had gotten pretty stressed about work. He’d gotten cagey about his calls. She said she’d noticed he had a secondary phone he kept in his car. She’d thought he was cheating and confronted him. He told her that he couldn’t tell her what was going on to keep her safe. That he loved her and the kids. That he’d tell her once everything was over.”</i>
</p><p>Wanda frowned.</p><p>“So we’re looking at coercion.”</p><p>Alice tilted her head.</p><p>“Or he’s on the take.”</p><p>
<i>”I don’t think he’s doing it because he wants to. Just a gut feeling, but that’s a pretty well-adjusted family. It’s obviously possible, but I’d be surprised.”</i>
</p><p>Wanda nodded.</p><p>“I’m inclined to agree. This is a waiting game. We need phone records and any possible hits on the tire prints left on the scene. Lilia, come back to the office. We’ll work the leads we can until something breaks.”<br/>
____</p><p>Alice sat up straighter in her seat, lifting the file from her table.</p><p>“Did the institute director mention anything about a Dr. Russell Adkins?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“Rio didn’t mention him.”</p><p>She ignored the looks at the use of Rio’s first name, saved her internal chastisement for later.</p><p>Alice turned the folder.</p><p>“Six years ago. Russell Adkins was a prominent member of the RRIM. He was an up-and-coming oncologist at a private hospital in Manchester, England. He accepted a position and moved within a month. It looks like his career was short-lived. But he made quite a stir while he was there. There are dozens of claims he made about the unethical manner with which their medical trials were conducted. He apparently got rather fanatical and sabotaged one of the trials.”</p><p>Agatha pulled the file toward herself.</p><p>“Dr. Russell Adkins contaminated the blood samples with dangerous amounts of Cesium-137, putting the entire laboratory in grave danger. The other doctor spearheading the trial was Patrick Graves.” She flipped the page and let out a whistle. “Adkins claimed he was in a sexual relationship with Graves and was insistent that Graves agreed with the ‘statement’ he was making.”</p><p>Agatha sat back, eyes immediately searching for Rio. She’d been in and out of the room for the past three hours, most of it spent on the phone or directing the media team. She looked back down at the file.</p><p>“If this is some kind of revenge, if Adkins is involved, he could be targeting Graves specifically if he feels betrayed.”</p><p>William made a startled sound, his eyes glued to his computer.</p><p>“Dr. Patrick Graves, Director of the RRIM, is speaking at a conference tomorrow in Virginia.” He read from the screen. “Restoring Trust: Ethical Trials and the Rebirth of Medical Integrity.”</p><p>The shift at the table was severe. Lilia leaned in.</p><p>“How large is this conference?”</p><p>William searched, his face blanching.</p><p>“It’s a national conference. There’s an expected attendance of twelve-thousand doctors from around the US. Some are traveling from overseas to attend.”</p><p>Wanda stood.</p><p>“I’ll update Director Vidal. We’ll pass this off to the overnight team. Go home, get some rest. Hopefully we can shut down this conference or at least delay it.”<br/>
_____</p><p>Agatha couldn’t sleep. The moment she’d left the WFO she felt herself split, part of her mind still stuck on the case, the other veering sharply to Rio; to their conversation, to the way it had felt to hold her again. She knew she shouldn’t reach out. The space was likely good: they needed to stay focused. They both needed rest. They both needed time to think and process their sudden reconnection.</p><p>It didn’t mean that laying in the bedroom of the guesthouse, alone, felt anything but terrible. The sheets were cold, the bed somehow felt less comfortable than Rio’s couch, and she was sinking into a strange, potent discontent that she hadn’t felt in years. Her grief had been so loud that it had drowned out the quieter emotions like loneliness and hope.</p><p>Agatha groaned and turned, twisting the sheets between her legs. She gave up after two hours of attempts and walked back down to the living room. She let Señor Scratchy from his cage and sat on the ground as he darted around her for the next several minutes. He’d just settled, his soft, furry head nudging into her hand, when there was a knock on the door.</p><p>Agatha glanced at the clock. 1:34 AM. It might be Wanda. She could likely see the lights of the guesthouse from her bedroom.</p><p>Agatha picked up Scratchy and pulled her silk robe tighter as she walked to the door. She tugged it open and stilled.</p><p>Rio was still in her suit but she looked exhausted. Her hair was loose, brushing her jaw and shoulders as she rocked. She looked uncertain but determined.</p><p>“I know I shouldn’t be here but I wanted to answer your question. From earlier.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart rate spiked, her lungs tightening in her chest.</p><p>Rio forged on.</p><p>“You asked me if–” Her eyes fell to the rabbit in Agatha’s hands and she gaped. “What– you have a rabbit?”</p><p>Agatha felt like pulling out her hair. She stepped aside and motioned Rio in.</p><p>“Can we just focus on one thing at a time? You had something to say?”</p><p>Rio stepped inside, eyes still on Señor Scratchy as he began wriggling in Agatha’s arm. She looked overwhelmed, her chest rising sharply.</p><p>“It looks just like him.”</p><p>Agatha forcibly set her desperation to hear Rio’s answer aside. She leaned down and let Scratchy onto the floor. He darted toward the kitchen, a flash of fur, and Agatha turned to Rio.</p><p>Rio looked stricken and Agatha stepped closer, her hand linking with Rio’s.</p><p>“If we sit down, he’ll come back. He’s a menace but he’s a lover too. Billy trained him to cuddle.”</p><p>Rio followed Agatha to the floor, both of them crossing their legs and staring toward the kitchen.</p><p>“Trained?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“Vision told me that while I was in Greece, anytime Scratchy sat with him for more than two seconds he was awarded a treat.” She rolled her eyes. “I had to put him on a diet when I got back.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Señor Scratchy blitzed back into the room, his hind legs kicking up behind him. As soon as he saw them on the floor, he slowed.</p><p>Rio’s voice was strained when she spoke beside her.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha looked over, saw tears in Rio’s eyes, and squeezed Rio’s hand tightly.</p><p>“I know. I saw him in those first few weeks I was here. I got him on a whim and I genuinely thought I might be crazy the next day when he got lost in the safe house.” Scratchy nudged at her hand and she scratched softly behind his ears. “I’m glad I got him though. Sometimes it felt like he was all I had.”</p><p>Scratchy’s nose twitched as he neared Rio, his ears shifting, and then he hopped into her lap.</p><p>Rio’s free hand shook slightly as she ran her fingers down the fur on his back. She took a deep breath.</p><p>“He’s really soft.”</p><p>Agatha released Rio’s hand so she could hold him properly.</p><p>“I know. Don’t you just feel terrible for suggesting you could ever curb stomp a bunny?”</p><p>Rio’s watery laugh burst out, startling Scratchy into another bout of zoomies that sent him careening around the couch. She laughed harder, and Agatha joined her.</p><p>Rio wiped at her eyes and sniffed.</p><p>“That was so mean. I was saying the bunny would be a terrible sidekick.”</p><p>Agatha leaned against the back of the couch, her body suddenly tired.</p><p>“Why did you really come here, Rio?”</p><p>It was said softly, hopefully, and Agatha couldn’t find it in herself to be chagrined.</p><p>Rio’s hands folded in her lap, her shoulders drooping slightly.</p><p>“I thought about going home. I should have. I know we have to be intentional here. But I couldn’t.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a breath, her eyes tracking the flex of Rio’s forearms as she clenched her hands.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Rio met her gaze, her lips pulling up in a sad smile.</p><p>“I’ve had to sleep alone for five years. Why would I do that again if there was a chance–” She hesitated. “If there was a chance I didn’t have to.”</p><p>Agatha pushed herself to her feet, her body flooded with feeling, her throat tight. Rio looked up, surprised, and Agatha held out her hand.</p><p>“Come on. It’s past two in the morning and we have to be at work in five hours.” She pulled Rio to her feet. “I don’t know if there’s extra toothbrushes here, but I have mouthwash.”</p><p>She started walking toward the stairs, Rio in tow, and felt a slight resistance. Looking back, she saw Rio’s eyes already on the stairs, her need heavy in her eyes.</p><p>Rio searched her expression.</p><p>“Are you sure? I don’t want to take away your space, Agatha. I know this wasn’t… the most orthodox move on my part.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and tugged again.</p><p>“When have we ever, in our lives, gone about things the most orthodox way?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks reddened and Agatha adored her.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her to the stairs and stopped.</p><p>“I have to put Scratchy away or he’ll eat the furniture. You can take anything you need from the closet.”<br/>
___</p><p>By the time Agatha reached her room, Rio was sitting on the edge of the bed in borrowed shorts and socks. She’d taken one of Agatha’s long-sleeved shirts and it sat loose on her frame.</p><p>The sight of her, waiting for Agatha, dressed in sleep clothes and near exhaustion, brought back an aching nostalgia. They’d done this a thousand times.</p><p>Agatha brushed her teeth, set her robe on its hook, and pulled the covers down.</p><p>“Let’s not overthink it now, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded and folded into the bed as Agatha did the same.</p><p>Agatha reached over and flicked off the lamp as Rio’s hands reached for her. She curled into Rio’s chest and pressed her face against Rio’s throat with a sigh.</p><p>She was on the verge of sleep, her mind fading in and out, when Rio whispered next to her.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Rio’s arms tightened.</p><p>“You asked if there was a path forward. For us.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio continued.</p><p>“That’s the only path I see.”</p>

<p>Agatha woke to the blaring of two alarms, a groan leaving her as she shifted. Soft hair, softer than hers, slid against her cheek and she blinked into the dim light of predawn.</p><p>Rio’s lips twisted in a grimace when the alarm didn’t immediately stop and she turned further into Agatha, her hand sliding around her back, her fingers pressing against Agatha’s skin where her shirt had risen up.</p><p>Her forehead pressed into Agatha’s shoulder as she pulled herself closer.</p><p>Agatha’s whole body buzzed, her heartbeat stuttering at the slide of warmth on her spine and Rio’s breath hot against her shirt.</p><p>She took note of her own limbs, finding one of her arms under Rio’s neck and one of her legs tangled up with Rio’s.</p><p>She felt the draw of sleep, the pull to find both of their phones and throw them toward the stairs in hopes they both fell far enough to go unheard.</p><p>Rio sighed and Agatha knew that wasn’t going to be an option.</p><p>Both of them twisted apart to silence their phones, their bodies sliding from one another, and Agatha turned off her alarm. They had twenty minutes before it was imperative that they start moving.</p><p>Rio settled back against the pillow, her eyes on the exposed ceiling, the stained beams, and the fan.</p><p>Her face was puffy, her eyes squinted from lack of sleep. Agatha was certain she’d never seen someone more beautiful.</p><p>Her breath felt constrained as she reached over, her fingers sliding through the hair that was pressed to Rio’s forehead.</p><p>Rio’s eyes closed, her mouth parting slightly as she let out an unsteady breath.</p><p>Neither said anything at the touch but Rio didn’t stop her.</p><p>Agatha ran her thumb over Rio’s brow and Rio’s eyes opened again.</p><p>She didn’t look over.</p><p>“I remember staring at this ceiling for hours when I stayed here. It had been over a year since  you’d left and I just–” She frowned. “I was so sure that the hurt of everything would fade over time. I thought I’d be able to handle the memories if they weren’t so fucking painful. I wasn’t doing well and Wanda asked me to move in so that I could help with the boys.” She chuckled. “She didn’t need my help. But she knew how to twist my arm.”</p><p>Agatha let her hand fall to Rio’s chest and rest there.</p><p>“Wanda is very persuasive. I’m pretty sure she lied to me when I had to move out of the safehouse to get me to come here.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled up in amusement.</p><p>“Oh, she did. I’d already placed that visiting team in a much closer safehouse.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Bitch.”</p><p>Rio grinned further, her eyes finally falling from the ceiling to meet Agatha’s.</p><p>“She hadn’t been allowed to look out for you for so long. I think she was willing to kidnap you here if you didn’t come willingly.”</p><p>Agatha let herself hold Rio’s eyes, let herself get lost in the rich brown.</p><p>“I don’t think that would have gone very well for her.”</p><p>Rio shrugged.</p><p>“She’s pretty good at getting what she wants.” She motioned lazily toward the room. “It seems like it was probably the right call.”</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“It definitely stripped away some of my stress; allowed me to focus on other things.” She looked away. “I’m sorry for taking this away from you; Wanda, Vision, the boys. I didn’t know–”</p><p>Rio frowned.</p><p>“You needed them, Agatha.”</p><p>“So did you.”</p><p>Rio blew out a breath.</p><p>“I’ve had them. I wouldn’t say I was ever… happy, but I got myself to a place of general content over the past few years. Taking a step back so that you could receive the support you kept refusing was not the sacrifice you seem to think it was. I was happy to do it. I was hopeful.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed the sudden tightness in her throat.</p><p>“I didn’t make it easy for anyone.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, but it held nothing but gentle amusement and mild exasperation.</p><p>“Agatha, you’ve never made anything easy. It’s part of your charm.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, prepared to disparage herself, and frowned when she heard the door open below.</p><p>Wanda’s voice rang out up the stairs.</p><p>“I don’t need answers, I just need to make sure you both make it to work on time.”</p><p>Rio pressed her hands over her face and let out a groan.</p><p>“I’m her boss, I can’t believe she’s making sure <i>I</i> get to work.”</p><p>Agatha felt the flutter of nerves, the disappointment that she’d have to leave this space and return to a world that had very little care for whether she and Rio figured this out. She drew her hand from Rio’s chest and forced herself out of bed, her heart aching as she moved away. She swallowed and began the transition from woman to agent. It was harder this time and she stepped into her closet in an effort to take some space from Rio’s perceiving eyes.</p><p>She pulled on dark gray slacks and a tan turtleneck with black paneling, her movements purposefully slow to give herself more time. She partially hoped that Rio would have already headed down to Wanda when she turned toward the door.</p><p>Rio was standing there, her go-bag standard suit already donned, and her arms crossed over her chest. She was looking at Agatha like she knew, and Agatha felt tears press against her eyes.</p><p>Agatha let out a tired breath.</p><p>“Do you remember what you used to say? Anytime we had to wake up at an ungodly hour or had to pay double for a midnight babysitter?”</p><p>Rio’s posture was soft as she smiled.</p><p>“If I was in charge I’d banish early and late call-ins because they were heinous and unforgivable.” She tilted her head back and forth. “I’ve been corrupted by fidelity.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“I knew you’d turn traitor. Power always went to your head.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed, her arms falling to her side as the conversation turned clearly away from work.</p><p>“It was never the power.”</p><p>Agatha barely heard her. She stared at the top buttons of Rio’s shirt and felt her stomach flip, her fingers curling into her palms as she stared. Her voice wavered.</p><p>“No?” She fought the urge to step closer. “What was it?”</p><p>It was absurd that the temperature in the room had sparked from just a few volleyed comments.</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell sharply.</p><p>“It was your response.” She looked on the edge of reaching out, her eyes dark. “You’ve always had an interesting relationship with power.”</p><p>Agatha felt herself move closer, her bare feet against the cool floor. She felt as if she were in a trance, her eyes locked on Rio’s collar. She drew to a stop a few inches away.</p><p>“I’m not sure I know what you mean.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers reached out and curled into the waistband of Agatha’s slacks. Her expression hardened, a taste of confidence appearing, and Agatha’s stomach swooped. She felt her cheeks warm.</p><p>Rio lifted a brow.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes slid from Rio’s collar to throat, to the muscle in her jaw, to her eyes, then back to the collar. She finally let herself reach. Her fingers caught the top button and she released it. Then the second. As she moved to the third, Rio’s fingers circled her wrist and it was so reminiscent of a better time that Agatha couldn’t breathe.</p><p>She wasn’t upset when Wanda’s interruption followed.</p><p>“There’s coffee!”</p><p>Rio’s expression released as she stepped back.</p><p>“I think we’re in trouble.”</p><p>Agatha stared after Rio as she retreated toward the steps, her shirt remaining unbuttoned, her dress shoes scooped from the floor to be carried down.</p><p>Agatha pressed both of her palms over her face and took deep breaths until she could pull herself together.</p><p>She put on her socks and shoes and followed the sounds of quiet conversation to the kitchen.</p><p>Wanda was in a navy suit and a white button-up. She had a coffee to her lips and her eyes danced as Agatha stepped into the room.</p><p>Rio was half-inside the freezer with a scowl on her face.</p><p>“What have you been eating?”</p><p>Agatha’s hackles raised slightly. She felt vulnerable with both Wanda and Rio in her space; the two people could read her, who saw through her. She felt unstable and she had to bite back her first response.</p><p>“Sawdust. Dried leaves. Leftover frosting from the twins’ last birthday.”</p><p>Rio snorted and closed the freezer, her questions ceasing like she remembered Agatha’s tells, like she still knew when to back off of a topic.</p><p>Wanda reached back and held out a coffee toward Agatha. She seemed inclined to stir the pot, her eyes filled with delight.</p><p>“Sorry to interrupt the morning meeting. Did the team miss the memo?”</p><p>Agatha let the coffee warm her hands.</p><p>“I think we could definitely set up shop in your guest house. You might need to boost your WiFi but there’s enough room for the team if Jen agrees to work in the cellar.”</p><p>Wanda grinned from where she leaned on the counter. She let her eyes flick between them.</p><p>“Both Billy and Tommy saw Auntie Rio’s car and had an unlimited amount of questions. From whether the guest house had two bedrooms all the way to begging to come visit you this morning instead of going to preschool.”</p><p>Rio took it in stride, as if this didn’t feel like an alternative reality, as if this wasn’t throwing her through loops and spirals and leaving her reeling.</p><p>“I can come say hi if they haven’t left yet.”</p><p>Wanda huffed.</p><p>“I sent them off with Vis to get breakfast beforehand. I wasn’t sure what I was walking into.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>“Any updates from the overnight team?”</p><p>Wanda raised a brow but allowed the subject change.</p><p>“The event is privately funded which has made their efforts rather fruitless. Bridgepoint Advanced Research and Zenith Foundation representatives resisted the need for a delay or cancellation of the event.”</p><p>Rio found a yogurt stuffed in the back of the fridge and grimaced as she looked at the expiration date. She tossed it in the trash and looked toward Wanda.</p><p>“How are their reputations? Any red flags?”</p><p>Wanda shook her head.</p><p>“It seems like a plethora of the usual reasons: investor and donor safety, fear of political fallout, state-backed pressure, international legal barriers. They’re Switzerland and Singapore based companies and the amount of roadblocks in place will push this situation to the wire if we can’t at least get boots on-site.”</p><p>Rio’s demeanor shifted, her brow furrowing as she pulled out her phone.</p><p>“Get me their representatives. I’ll make the call.”</p><p>Wanda nodded.</p><p>Agatha felt the reprieve of the switch into work-mode and she pulled open a cabinet to retrieve a bright blue box. She took the last crinkling, silver package and held it toward Rio.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, an innocent excitement flashing through her that crushed Agatha’s lungs. She took the pop tart from Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>“Oh my god I haven’t had one of these in years.” She stripped the thin package open. “Holy shit.”</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio, and she wanted nothing more in this moment than to be just a normal person; to have a nine-to-five that she was allowed to play hooky. All so that she could spend more time with this ridiculous woman who managed a position of serious power but still got excited by the sight of a processed rectangle of sugar.</p><p>For years, having any kind of honest conversation with herself or anyone else had been her greatest terror. Now that she’d taken that first step, now that she could taste a future that didn’t hurt quite so terribly, she wanted to be consumed by it.</p><p>Wanda walked toward the door, her hand squeezing Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“I’ll see you both at the office.”</p><p>Rio mumbled a goodbye, her mouth stuffed with chocolate pop tart, and Agatha stared at her and cried.</p><p>Rio’s eyes shot wide, two steps taking her within range of Agatha. She looked ridiculous as she tried to swallow the dry pastry with a deeply concerned look on her face.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, wiping and laughing tiredly.</p><p>“I’m fine, I promise.” She laughed again and sniffed. “Jesus Christ. You look stupid eating that.”</p><p>Rio coughed, her face grimacing in discomfort, before she was able to clear her throat.</p><p>“I forgot how much they stick to your mouth.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“I’m sure it won’t stop you from eating it.”</p><p>Rio feigned offense.</p><p>“Of course not. Am I supposed to starve? What are you eating?” She reached for the uneaten half. “Here.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, lips twisted.</p><p>“I’d actually rather eat the sawdust.” She finished her coffee and set the mug in the sink. “We should go.”</p><p>Rio touched her side, her fingers splaying on Agatha’s ribcage.</p><p>“Agatha.” She waited until Agatha looked. “I know how you’re feeling right now. Once this case has been handled, we’ll be able to have a semblance of a life and you and I will talk without interruption.”</p><p>Agatha leaned into the warmth of Rio’s hand, her chest rising and falling in a sharp sigh. The distinct one-eighty, the sudden urge to let all of her thoughts, scrambled and unintelligible, spill from her mouth, had Agatha on edge. She swallowed her heart and nodded.</p><p>“I know we will.”</p><p>A pressing, chafing thought; the fear that Rio would change her mind or remember how fucking hard Agatha had made her life, had poisoned Agatha’s mind.</p><p>But, they had a job to do. Agatha let her fear settle deep into the recesses of her mind as she turned to the door.<br/>
______</p><p>Agatha tried not to stare as Rio paced the operations room like she was the harbinger of a coming storm.</p><p>Will was on her left, Alice was on her right, and Jen and Lilia were unashamedly turned around in their seats to watch the absolute dressing down Rio was giving to some representative from Zenith.</p><p>Rio’s jaw stood out prominently as she listened to the other end. Her voice was smooth iron and her words licked across Agatha’s skin.</p><p>“The danger posed to everyone attending this conference and the surrounding public should be your first priority. If I am forced to relay, once more, <i>why</i> I need my agents on-site and looped in with your private security, you will have the IRS, the Treasury Department, and the FTC, barking at your heels for what remains of your organization’s lifespan.”</p><p>There was a pause as Rio listened to the response. Her answer was just as icy as before but her posture settled slightly.</p><p>“Thank you for your time, Lucien. We’ll have a team on the ground in thirty minutes. I expect that your private security will defer to my agents.”</p><p>She hung up before a response could come through and Jen whistled.</p><p>“Wow, that’s terrifying. And kind of ho—.”</p><p>Lilia slapped Jen’s shoulder.</p><p>“Have an ounce of decorum.”</p><p>Jen shrugged, her attention returning to the files.</p><p>“They couldn’t get ahold of Graves?”</p><p>William shook his head.</p><p>“He’s turned off his phone. We found it at his house. His financial records show he’s at the hotel where the conference is being held but we’re still waiting on the warrant to access his room number.”</p><p>Rio walked toward them with Wanda on her heels.</p><p>“We have the green light to flood agents into the hotel and conference center. It’s likely Adkins and whomever is working for him has set up somewhere in the hotel. I want your team on it. I’ll be coordinating from site and working on access.”</p><p>Alice nodded.</p><p>“They won’t cancel?”</p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>“They don’t believe the threat is credible and we don’t have anything substantial beyond a very probable theory. Adkins is still in Maryland and he’s been a vocal member of a number of radical environmental groups. He’s spoken against the RRIM multiple times and has likely been a huge thorn in their side. We don’t know why it’s escalated to this level, but when all signs point north…”</p><p>Wanda finished.</p><p>“You go north.” She nodded to the team. “Gear up. I want full tactical gear and full face respirators.”</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“No PPE?”</p><p>Wanda’s jaw clenched.</p><p>“No. They’re worried it’ll cause a panic if we show up in radiation suits.” William looked truly terrified as Wanda continued. “We’ll be wearing lead-lined vests and gloves. We’ll have suits and a decontamination zone on site. The moment we get the go-ahead, we’ll evacuate the site. Until then, stay cautious and don’t do anything stupid. If you get eyes on Adkins or the missing cesium, do not engage until I give the go-ahead.”</p><p>The team nodded as they stood, William following suit, and Agatha raised a brow.</p><p>“You are off-site for this one, Will.”</p><p>William looked conflicted, his fear as present as his determination.</p><p>“I can help.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. It wasn’t her place to make the call but she was making it.</p><p>“I know. From here. Dig further into Adkins. See if you can find any record of connection with Director Graves in the past year.”</p><p>William glanced toward Wanda and only nodded when the directions weren’t countered. He turned to their shared office and Agatha followed.</p><p>She closed the door as the rest of the team geared up.</p><p>“You will be helpful here.”</p><p>He sat at his desk and chewed his lip, his brow furrowed, his eyes distant.</p><p>“I know, I just— I know you want me here because you think I’ll freeze or fuck up.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. There was no sugar coating this part of the job. He’d have to adapt or find a new career.</p><p>“This is new to you. You have not been trained for the pressure and the fear that comes with a situation that puts your life on the line. Your team comes first. Always. If you are a threat to that team, you swallow your pride and do what you can.” She heard the irony and attempted to lighten the mood. “Or you throw your boss into a door.” She aimed her thumb toward the operations room. “Want me to send in Agent Maximoff?”</p><p>William rolled his eyes, his lips turning up.</p><p>“I’ll dive into Adkins and relay what I find.”<br/>
_______</p><p>Agatha was sweating. The heavy weight of the vest on her shoulders and the suffocating gloves on her hands had her pulling at her collar for some air.</p><p>The team seemed to be fairing similarly; beads of sweat sat on their temples and their cheeks were all flushed.</p><p>They’d set up in a conference room on the first floor of the hotel, the entire hallway blocked off by “reserved” signs.</p><p>Wanda had a blueprint of the hotel on the widescreen at the head of the room.</p><p>“We are running through the floors from penthouse to basement with Geiger counters until we have warrants for a more thorough search. We believe they’ll be situated in a room instead of an employee space or storage area.”</p><p>Alice pointed toward the bottom corner of the map.</p><p>“The lower levels would have less foot traffic and it looks like they travel through to the conference center.”</p><p>Wanda nodded.</p><p>“They may use the lower levels as a route, but they aren’t temperature controlled. Cesium 137 needs to be at room temperature to remain chemically stable.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the twenty floors they’d be attempting to clear in the next two hours. The conference would begin at ten and guests would begin to pour in en masse in about thirty minutes.</p><p>“They won’t want to be in the same room as the material. It’s likely we’re looking at a string of rooms that have their do not disturb signs up.”</p><p>Wanda confirmed.</p><p>“If you encounter anything suspicious or your detectors alert, fall back and wait for orders. Kale, Harkness, I want you starting at the penthouse level. Calderu, Gulliver, you’re on ten coming down. I’ll be relaying all information to and from Director Vidal and our other agents on-site.”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“I thought my only concern would be radiation exposure. Not Kale’s sights on my neck.”</p><p>Jennifer scoffed.</p><p>“Please, if anyone would take a pot shot, it would be you.”</p><p>Agatha grinned sharply and stood.</p><p>“You’re right. You take lead. I’ll watch your back.”</p><p>Jennifer rolled her eyes as the team moved out.<br/>
———</p><p>Moving through the halls was a slow process, the lack of credible intel meaning that every room could be a plausible threat. Kale had the Geiger counter on her hip, her jacket covering the bulk of the vest and the harness where her issued piece sat.</p><p>They’d cleared three floors without any radiation alert and Agatha felt the impending catastrophe they were attempting to curtail heavy on her spine.</p><p>She made a vaguely robotic beeping sound and saw Kale freeze in front of her and quickly relax.</p><p>“God dammit, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“Just keeping you on your toes, Kale.”</p><p>Jennifer slowed and fell into step with Agatha.</p><p>“It feels like we’re wasting time.”</p><p>On that, Agatha could agree.</p><p>“You could start screaming on every floor. See if it draws anyone out.”</p><p>“Right, let’s announce ourselves to make easier targets.”</p><p>Agatha lifted a shoulder.</p><p>“Oh I’d be tucked away somewhere. Only you would be a target.”</p><p>“I miss when you were hospitalized in Greece.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“I bet. It must suck riding my coattails all the time.”</p><p>Wanda’s voice came over the comms.</p><p>
<i>”Let’s aim for professional, agents.”</i>
</p><p>On cue, both spoke the same line.</p><p>“She started it.”</p><p>“She started it.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile matched Kale’s as they took the stairs to the eighteenth floor.</p><p>They’d just pushed through into the hallway when the Geiger counter spiked, the sound sending ice through Agatha’s spine.</p><p>She stilled, Kale matching her, and spoke quietly.</p><p>“Floor Eighteen. We have activity.”</p><p>Wanda’s voice cut through.</p><p>
<i>”Levels?”</i>
</p><p>Jen looked at the device.</p><p>“Nearly zero. It’s either far away or contained properly.”</p><p>Agatha stepped into the hall despite Kale’s warning look, her eyes and ears on her surroundings.</p><p>Wanda spoke again.</p><p>
<i>”Press forward. If it spikes, retreat.”</i>
</p><p>A violent retching sound came from a few doors ahead and Agatha unclipped her holster.</p><p>“What are the effects of gamma radiation exposure?”</p><p>Kale took up a position a step and a half back.</p><p>“Depends on exposure. Fatigue and headaches at low exposure. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea at higher levels. If there’s contact to the ski—“</p><p>Agatha waved her silent as the retching occurred again, closer and clearly behind the door ahead.</p><p>She reached the door and listened, her eyes falling back to see if the Geiger counter reading had increased.</p><p>Kale shook her head.</p><p>There was no ‘do not disturb’ placard on the door and Agatha reached up and knocked.</p><p>“Housekeeping.”</p><p>There was a muffled moan and a hoarse ‘I’m good’ through the door.</p><p>Agatha knocked again and then pressed her fingers against the handle to simulate the sound.</p><p>There was a louder groan and the door jerked open.</p><p>It was a man in his late thirties, his head almost entirely bald and his clothes rumpled and stained. The room reeked of alcohol and vomit and she could see the stamp from a club on the back of his hand.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>“I said I’m good!” He doubled over, his sweaty face pressing into the door. “If you feel like bringing me water though—“</p><p>Agatha pulled the door closed.</p><p>“False alarm. He’s just hungover.”</p><p>Rio’s voice came through the comms.</p><p>
<i>“We’re continuing to receive pushback on the evacuation. This is a conference filled with oncologists and there is a non-zero chance of certain medical equipment reading on the Geiger. I am speaking with the front desk to see if I can get Graves on the phone.</i>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to pull out her hair.</p><p>She turned to Kale just as a door at the end of the hallway jerked open.</p><p>The Geiger counter screeched to life as a man stumbled out, his face red and slick with sweat. He dropped to a knee and then pushed himself up as he coughed.</p><p>“Help— help me— please.”</p><p>He stumbled again, dry heaving, and Agatha’s stomach dropped at the blossoming burns on the skin around his nose, mouth, and cheeks.</p><p>Agatha pushed Kale backward.</p><p>“Kale, mask up.”</p><p>Both drew their respirators from beneath their jackets and pressed them over their faces.</p><p>The man stumbled forward again, his eyes blood-red and blinking painfully.</p><p>“Please!!”</p><p>Agatha maintained a level voice as she spoke to the team.</p><p>“Evacuate the building.”</p><p>From behind the choking man, Agatha watched as an individual in full radiation gear stepped from the room. He had a backpack on that looked too heavy, the straps pressing down into the suit as his head turned toward them. She could barely make out the face of Adkins behind the shield. He turned the opposite direction and ran toward the steps.</p><p>Agatha swore.</p><p>“Adkins is on floor eighteen! He’s not hitting the conference. He’s targeting individuals.”</p><p>Calderu’s voice sounded, the tone terse and warped by her own respirator.</p><p>
<i>”He has a partner on floor seven. We have two victims in need of urgent medical care for suspected radiation exposure.”</i>
</p><p>Rio’s voice cut through, commanding.</p><p>
<i>”I want full radiation suits donned by all on-site agents! Drisk, Patel, get PPEs to our agents on floors seven and eighteen. Calderu, Gulliver, Kale, Harkness, do not engage! Draw back.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha and Jen continued to back away as the exposed man struggled toward them.</p><p>Kale shook her head.</p><p>“If we evacuate this building, everyone on this floor that steps out is going to come in contact.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a slow breath.</p><p>“If we don’t evacuate, we risk Adkins finding a way to infect everyone here.”</p><p>Kale swore and spoke quickly over the comms.</p><p>“Where are the HVAC units for this hotel?”</p><p>There was a pause, then Wanda answered.</p><p><i>”Roof.”</i>”</p><p>Kale shook her head, her eyes locked onto Agatha.</p><p>“We don’t have time to wait for suits. If he gets to the roof he can blast whatever he has through the HVAC system. That would irradiate the entire building and the immediate area.”</p><p>Agatha grit her teeth as they turned to the stairs.</p><p>Rio’s voice snapped through the comms and it sounded like she was running.</p><p>
<i>“I want power cut to the entire building. Kale, Harkness, do not move from your position. Do you copy?”</i>
</p><p>Kale lifted a brow at Agatha and Agatha, for once, felt bad for her blatant disobedience. She nodded and both of them stepped into the stairwell.</p><p>Agatha tried to soften the blow.</p><p>“We copy. We won’t engage unless absolutely necessary.”</p><p>She could imagine Rio’s face and she clenched her teeth to stem the guilt.</p><p>Rio cut through again.</p><p>
<i>”Hold at the access hatch. Do not engage Adkins without protection. That is an order.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s heart was pounding violently and her body was covered in a cold sweat as they took the stairs carefully toward the top floor. She would listen if she could. If it was possible to wait and still stop Adkins, she would listen.</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>They moved through the next two flights with focus and precision. As they reached the penthouse, they found the end of the stairwell.</p><p>Agatha pushed into the hall.</p><p>“Other stairwell.”</p><p>They’d just started down the hallway when the elevator doors dinged. Both raised their weapons and lowered them quickly as two agents stepped into the hall in standard-issued radiation suits.</p><p>Agatha was almost relieved she was going to be able to listen to Rio.</p><p>“Kale and Harkness standing down until we get our PPE.”</p><p>The two agents moved from the elevator and toward the opposite stairwell.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed at the familiar gaits of the agents in front of her and took a step. Something sick and cold curled around her spine.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>The forms didn’t slow, but Rio’s voice came through the comms and echoed in the hall.</p><p>“Stand down, Agent Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat nearly closed. She was stopped from pursuing by a hand on her arm.</p><p>Agatha forced her lungs to work as Rio and Wanda disappeared into the stairwell.</p><p>The wait was excruciating. The next minute passed as if every second was twenty, and Agatha felt the tension in every fiber of her body. Rio and Wanda called in their breach just as two figures sprinted from the opposing stairwell with full suits.</p><p>The next series of calls from the comms came in rapid succession.</p><p>Lilia marked the apprehension and containment of the partner and the location of Graves.</p><p>Alice announced that power would be shut off in two minutes.</p><p>As Agatha was shoving her body into the radiation suit— the agents behind them zipping both her and Kale in— gunfire sounded from the rooftop.</p><p>Rio shouted, her words strained.</p><p>
<i>”We’re taking fire! Adkins has accessed the HVAC system and he has two gunmen on his position”</i>
</p><p>Agatha and Jennifer bolted toward the stairwell with the other agents sticking close.</p><p>Their feet pounded on the cement steps as they approached the exterior door.</p><p>Wind whistled loudly through the thin reliefs creating a harrowing sound on top of the bursts of gunfire.</p><p>Agatha unholstered her firearm and braced against the door.</p><p>“Ready to breach. Give the signal!”</p><p>The bursts of sound suddenly doubled as Rio and Wanda provided cover-fire.</p><p>Wanda called through.</p><p>
<i>”Cover immediately to your left. Move now!”</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s shoulder slammed into the compression bar and she sprinted outside, eyes clocking large machines and structures to press herself behind.</p><p>She heard Kale at her back, the two other agents taking up positions several feet away.</p><p>Exhaust from the air conditioners spilled up toward the sky and the machinery hummed, droning under the sound of feet scraping cement and the firefight.</p><p>She couldn’t see Rio and Wanda, but with a quick look around her cover, she saw the edge of a bright yellow radiation suit belonging to one of the gunmen on the far side of the rooftop. She signaled to Kale.</p><p>Kale put a hand on her shoulder and spoke quietly.</p><p>“We’re at your nine. One gunman spotted but behind cover.”</p><p>Wanda responded.</p><p>
<i>”Vidal is attempting to get a visual on Adkins. I’ll provide cover-fire. Get closer if you can.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at the two other agents, motioning them right. They acknowledged and hunkered low.</p><p>She waited for Kale’s okay, for Wanda’s suppressive fire, and swerved into the wide alley of boxy structures on the roof. She hit a dead sprint, eyes on the yellow of the target, and made it to the halfway point before the yellow suit shifted and the black of a barrel came into view.</p><p>“Cover!”</p><p>She dove into cover, her elbow striking the cement hard as she slid. She grimaced as she looked toward Kale on the other side of the alley.</p><p>“We’re within thirty feet.”</p><p>Rio’s voice came through quietly.</p><p>
<i>”Make some noise on my signal. I’m ten feet out from Adkins and he’s unloading half a dozen shielded containers.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha pushed herself into position as bullets spiked into metal and kicked up cement beside her. Kale followed suit opposite her.</p><p>Agatha’s hairs stood on end as Rio’s “now” whispered through the line.</p><p>In time, as five agents laid down cover, the hum of machines ceased entirely, the power shutting off.</p><p>Agatha saw a spray of red on yellow as one of Kale’s shots hit home against the target and she pressed forward, moving up ten feet as the gunman retreated behind cover. She could just make out Adkins kneeling beside the open face of an HVAC unit, his backpack sitting beside him on the ground. He was fully focused as he sat silver, cylindrical containers beside himself on the ground.</p><p>Rio came into view behind the HVAC unit, her body pressed tightly to the metal.</p><p>A strained, agitated voice sounded.</p><p>“If you’d just let me complete my work, I wouldn’t be resorting to this! Only a few needed to suffer for the sins of many.”</p><p>Adkins didn’t seem to mind that he didn’t receive an answer.</p><p>Agatha watched him lift one of the leaden containers and rest it on the edge of the HVAC unit. Rio was inching closer.</p><p>Adkins continued.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you kill me, it doesn’t matter if you bury my name and my mission in redacted paperwork and metal cabinets.” His movements were precise as he fiddled with the case. The seal released. “I will have succeeded.”</p><p>Agatha tried to suss out Rio’s best path to success. There was an injured gunman currently kneeling out of sight behind cover and another somewhere Agatha had yet to lay eyes on. She didn’t have a clear shot at Adkins due to the bunching of pipes curling at his back, but she could draw his attention. She raised her voice.</p><p>“Most of our documentation is online, actually.”</p><p>Adkins stilled his movements, his head turning slightly as he looked toward Agatha’s voice. It was an announcement of her position, a dangerous way to draw attention, but the injured gunman leaned around the corner and raised his weapon in Agatha’s direction.</p><p>Adkins called back, his voice trembling with rage.</p><p>“You fail to see the bigger picture! You work for the hive, your mind is not your own.” He seemed to calm himself and carefully picked up the next lead case. “It’s not your fault. To split from the path is to choose a painful awareness. There is a striking acceptance of complacency in our world and to see it is to despair.”</p><p>He set the newly opened containment cylinder down carefully and selected the next.</p><p>Agatha spoke quietly to her team.</p><p>“Does anyone have eyes on the second gunman?”</p><p>Wanda cut through.</p><p>
<i>”Confirmed. He’s flanking Adkins. I could draw him out but not without risk.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s gloved hands tightened around her weapon as she calculated.</p><p>“He’s got three of those transport cylinders open and doesn’t look to be stopping.”</p><p>Kale met Agatha’s eyes across the gap.</p><p>
<i>”The gamma radiation coming from those open containers is already highly dangerous. If the powder is open and dispersed, even without flooding the HVAC, we have a serious problem.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha grunted her affirmation as Adkins spoke again.</p><p>He had four open containment cylinders beside him and was working on a fifth.</p><p>“The building is equipped with backup generators that should kick in at any moment.” He reached for the final cylinder. “And if your team has managed to cut off the back-up,” He set the final open cylinder on the ground. “Well, I’m certain my message will reach those immediate area.” He sighed. “It’s a shame, truly. Radiation sickness is a terrible thing to endure.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped as he lifted two of the containers and stood.</p><p>“He’s going to release them.” Her adrenaline severed her connection to her fear, her breathing leveled out as she tensed. “I’m pressing now. Provide cover.”</p><p>Rio’s voice was barely a whisper, her proximity to Akins keeping her quiet.</p><p>
<i>”Flood them.”</i>
</p><p>Kale was the first to fire, her bullets kicking into the metal frame with loud pings and screeches. Agatha flung herself from her position, her own weapon firing twice as she sprinted toward the massive HVAC unit.</p><p>Rio moved in unison, rounding the corner of the HVAC unit and– Agatha nearly screamed. Rio had no weapon out. She collided with Adkins and stabilized the jarred containers, her hands closing around his on the handles as he struggled.</p><p>It left her entirely unprotected, her hands occupied as Adkins yanked and kicked and lunged toward her.</p><p>Rio held her ground, using her weight to drag Adkins to the ground and minimize the dispersion risk. Agatha got a bead and fired twice at the injured gunman, his weapon clattering to the ground as his head fell back.</p><p>She’d just rounded the corner when an impact hit Rio’s body and forced her backward with a shocking jolt.</p><p>Agatha whirled just as Wanda appeared and dropped the shooter. She couldn’t breathe. She had to clamber over the dozens of metal tubes to get to Rio and Adkins was already pulling himself to his feet, one hand reaching for one of the cylinders while the other brandished a short blade.</p><p>He ran toward Rio as she struggled to stand, slicing at her, and she parried the attack enough that miss her throat and cut into the suit at her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha felt nothing as she bludgeoned her limbs on metal to reach the other side. Her body was in a near-free fall of panic as Rio stepped back from the next swing.</p><p>Agatha wanted to launch Adkins from the 20th story. She wanted to shred his suit and watch his body slowly give way to the effects of radiation. Instead, she drove her boot into the back of his knee. As he collapsed, she caught his arm and dislodged the canister.</p><p>Rio weakly kicked out and knocked the blade from his hand before collapsing back to the ground.</p><p>Wanda and Jen closed in, the other agents following suit. Agatha let go of Adkins, used all of her will to gently set the canister aside, and scrambled toward where Rio was pushing herself up. Rio’s suit had been punctured in the chest, the bullet caught in the vest. No blood seeped from the hole and Agatha felt the faintest twinge of relief.</p><p>Rio lifted her arm and Agatha saw the gash from the blade, blood slicking the radiation suit and dripping down the sleeve.</p><p>Agatha helped Rio stand with her uninjured arm as Jen shouted behind them.</p><p>“Get her out of here, now!”</p><p>Agatha dragged Rio toward the stairwell with fluctuating terror and Rio used her free hand to block the hole in the suit of her chest. Agatha flung the door open and pushed them into the stairwell as she called for help.</p><p>“Radiation suit failure, definite exposure.”</p><p>Fully outfitted agents hurried past them from the hallway to aid in Adkins’ arrest and Agatha listened over the pounding feet as directions were delivered calmly from the teams below.</p><p>She and Rio started down the arduous, twenty-story descent toward the decontamination zone. She could hardly breathe, hardly speak, and while Rio was carrying her own weight, she was slowed by cracked ribs and blood loss.</p><p>A team of medics met them at the fourteenth floor with a stair chair. They strapped Rio in and moved off with urgency, leaving Agatha to follow behind with her heart in her throat and her lungs seizing with every breath.<br/>
______</p><p>By the time Agatha was allowed to see Rio again, she’d nearly bitten the head off of every specialist that had come within a two-foot radius.</p><p>All exposed agents, including the medical staff that had carried Rio down the stairs, were placed into decontamination procedures. Agatha’s suit was vacuumed and a damp wipe was used to remove any loose powder from the fabric. The process was explained in depth but Agatha caught every fourth word.</p><p>She was then misted down and the suit was very, very carefully unzipped and peeled inside out and away from her body. The specialist in the room placed the suit in a radioactive waste bag before returning to Agatha with a geiger counter for a thorough search.</p><p>She was moved and left with an FBI sweatsuit with orders to shower with soap and water.</p><p>When she reemerged, Jen, Alice, Lilia, and Wanda were already gathered outside the decontamination zone.</p><p>Wanda looked at her approach with concern.</p><p>“You okay? Word on Rio?”</p><p>Agatha’s teeth ground together.</p><p>“I’m fine. I haven’t heard anything on Rio.”</p><p>Wanda nodded.</p><p>“I’ll get one.” She looked exhausted, her hair frizzy and pressed against her skull. “The rest of you can head back to the WFO. There’s going to be an ungodly amount of paperwork to complete after this shitshow.”</p><p>Lilia looked relieved, her shoulders slumping slightly as she complied. She touched Agatha’s shoulder and moved past, a complaint leaving her lips.</p><p>“I think exposure to radioactive material should give us a ‘go home early from work’ pass.”</p><p>There were mumbled agreements from Jen and Alice as they trailed after Lilia, both following suit and pressing a hand to Agtha’s shoulder.</p><p>Wanda focused her attention on Agatha.</p><p>“She’s going to be fine.”</p><p>Agatha glanced back toward the decontamination zone with her heart in her throat.</p><p>“She fucking better be.”<br/>
______</p><p>Rio was released when it was nearly dark outside. The sun was low in the sky and Agatha was nearly starving and even closer to rabid. Clean-up crews had been on-site from moments after arrest until now and they had yet to descend.</p><p>Agatha’s agitation seeped away as Rio, donning the same sweatsuit, stepped into her view.</p><p>She looked weary and pale, her gait slow as she walked toward Agatha with the mantle of her position worn on her face. She didn’t stop to talk, walking past Agatha with a slight tilt of her head.</p><p>Agatha followed after her, then passed her, to open the passenger side door of Rio’s SUV and help her inside.</p><p>Rio’s jaw locked as she hoisted herself up, her face twisting in pain as she settled into the leather.</p><p>Agatha climbed into the driver’s seat and started the engine.</p><p>They didn’t idle and chat. In fact, neither spoke until they’d lost sight of the hotel and pulled onto the highway.</p><p>Rio’s rigid posture and blank expression faltered, a small gasp leaving her mouth as she shed her stoicism.</p><p>Agatha’s chest squeezed.</p><p>“Did they give you the good stuff?”</p><p>Rio blew out a huff that was probably supposed to be a chuckle.</p><p>“No. Advil. I’m on Prussian Blue. A 1 gram dose three times a day for the next month.”</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“And the ribs? The cut?”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, her head resting against the headrest.</p><p>“Two ribs at the impact site. The cut wasn’t deep. Just five stitches.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a sharp breath, her fingers wrapped tightly around the wheel.</p><p>“Rio–”</p><p>Rio hissed out a pained breath.</p><p>“Can you update me on the details of the case? I don’t– I just need to not talk until I’m able to lay down.”</p><p>Agatha did.</p><p>Adkins had confessed the intended plan without resistance. Hit six targets; doctors that had broken their oaths, that had pressed the boundaries of what was safe for their patients in the name of progress. He’d gotten to three, Graves not being one of them, and had changed his tactics when he’d seen Agatha and Jen.</p><p>She took the familiar route back toward Rio’s home.</p><p>“Graves is nearly hysterical and they’re letting him cool off before they attempt to get anything from him. The conference has been fully cancelled and both of its largest investors are in hot water after the near disaster.” Agatha huffed. “The hotel is threatening legal action but they have nothing to stand on.”</p><p>She fell silent a moment as she changed lanes, avoiding the series of metal plates lain over the road in a construction zone.</p><p>“The three victims attacked individually are in critical care. They received a rather excessive blast of Cesium powder directly to the faces. We’ll know a bit more in the coming days but none of them will get out unscathed.” As they neared the familiar neighborhood, Agatha tried not to overthink. “I’ll walk you in and get you settled.”</p><p>Rio groaned as they turned into the cul de sac, the wheels bumping over a groove in the road, and Agatha slowed the vehicle to a crawl as they neared the destination. She gently eased the SUV into the driveway.</p><p>Agatha turned off the vehicle and circled the car to help Rio onto the pavement. She kept a hand on her back to steady her as they made their way to the front door.</p><p>Agatha’s hands shook as she pressed the key into the lock and let herself into the house. Rio had her hand held against her injured ribs as she stepped inside, her head hanging slightly. She looked like she was about to fold into the couch and Agatha caught her carefully.</p><p>“Upstairs.”</p><p>Rio’s lips turned down into a pout, the facade of the Director entirely faded. It had been a shocking discovery early in their relationship: Rio Vidal was a massive baby when injured or sick and she made it everyone’s problem. Everyone being Agatha.</p><p>Seeing that now, the sad little scrunch in her nose and the tragic line of her frown, Agatha’s emotions from the waiting and worrying threatened to overrun her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t let Rio’s dragging feet hinder her as she guided them up the steps and past Nicky’s room. She carefully leaned Rio against the large bed in her room before she left her to walk into the closet. She returned with a pair of thick socks and dropped them on the comforter.</p><p>“Are you going to brush your teeth?”</p><p>Rio frowned petulantly.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, heart warm, and nodded.</p><p>“Fine. Up you go.”</p><p>She helped Rio to the side and pulled back the covers. The gasp that left Rio’s lips as her hand slipped on the way up had Agatha’s spine tingling in sympathetic pain. As soon as Rio managed to lay back, Agatha pulled off the cheap socks from Rio’s time in decontamination and tossed them toward the hamper. She gently replaced them with the warmer ones and let her hand settle on Rio’s ankle.</p><p>With every task completed, Agatha felt as if she should leave. She wanted nothing less.</p><p>“Can I do anything else, Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were already blinking against exhaustion but she refocused in order to find Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>“You should probably try not to jostle me as you get in the bed.</p><p>Agatha’s spine and chest and limbs seemed to relax at the words, her jaw finally releasing with a painful burn.</p><p>“Let me brush my teeth.”</p><p>When Agatha slipped back into the room, her thoughts were floating between the magnitude of climbing into-and sleeping- in this bed and room that had once belonged to both of them, and the banality of whether she needed to text Wanda an update or go through the details of the case.</p><p>She found Rio already fully asleep, her lips parted slightly, her hair messy around her face, and Agatha climbed carefully beside her and settled into the sheets. She placed a hand on Rio’s arm, needing reassurance that she was there and well, and Rio let out a quiet sound. The whine curled through Agatha’s skull, traveled along her spine, and thudded into her chest.</p><p>She closed her eyes and, for the third night in a row, fell asleep beside Rio.</p>

<p>Agatha blinked against the bright sunlight streaming through the room and for a moment, she was a wife again. A mother. The way the sunlight soaked the comforter had her stretching like she’d done a thousand times before. She listened for Nicky’s cry and felt a serenity at the silence, the few precious moments she’d be able to stay in bed.</p><p>The silence curdled, the hammerstrike of reality rumbling through her. She sucked in a breath and pushed through the disorienting pain. Agatha blinked as the events of the day before slunk back in, her eyes traveling to Rio’s still sleeping form. She was tucked almost entirely under the covers, the only parts of her face visible were the bridge of her nose and her eyebrows.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach growled and she felt sick from hunger, her belly coiled and small. She carefully slid from the covers and set her feet to the sun-soaked floors.</p><p>With quiet steps, Agatha slipped from the room.</p><p>It felt right to relegate herself to the guest bathroom, to use a toothbrush that wasn’t really hers. There was a gnawing sense that she was overreaching, that extending so far would leave her open to a strike to the ribcage.</p><p>She padded down the steps, phone in hand, and entered the kitchen.</p><p>She had a text from Wanda telling her to take the day and make sure Rio didn’t attempt to come into work. Agatha almost laughed. Rio was a disaster when she was sick or hurt or had the smallest of stomach aches. She couldn’t imagine, even with her new position, that she’d changed so much in the past five years. Especially not if her behavior the night before had been an indication. The very first time Agatha had been around Rio while she was sick, she’d nearly lost her mind with the drastic one-eighty Rio had performed.</p><p>
<i>Rio had texted her an hour prior that she wasn’t feeling well, that she was skipping trivia to try and sleep off whatever had her under the weather. And Agatha, because they were trying this, because they spent their nights together more times than not, had decided to skip trivia too.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d gone to the store and purchased a few too many items that Rio likely wouldn’t need before packing it all in her car and making her way toward Rio’s apartment.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Now she was standing in front of the door, the welcome mat with black and white images of iconic horror movie killers and the words ‘The Psycho Bunch’ under her feet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She knocked twice and waited.</i>
</p><p>
<i>And waited.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She knocked again and frowned, a slight rush of concern filling her as she once more received no response. She pulled out her phone and dialed Rio. She was nearly ready to pick the lock, the phone ringing endlessly, when Rio answered with a weak:</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>”Agatha?”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, I’m outside.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She expected to hear footsteps or an explanation and received neither. Rio groaned on the other end.</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>”I think the window is unlocked.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s brows lifted, her eyes flicking over to the walkway and the small window beside the door.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio made a pathetic sound and Agatha’s brows inched further onto her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>”The window–”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, I’m not climbing through the window of my fucking girlfriend’s apartment. Where are you?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>There was a pause.</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>”On the couch.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha considered hanging up. Instead, she began knocking again, her fist banging against the door.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Open the door, Rio.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s moan on the other end had Agatha worried that she was deeply ill, and she waited impatiently for the lock to turn.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The door opened into a dimly lit living room with the blinds drawn and the only light coming from the television. Rio looked… fine. Her face was somewhat pale and her hair was a mess, but Agatha had seen sicker geese at the park. She stepped inside with her two bags and glanced at the television screen. Tom and Jerry was playing, the image grainy, and Agatha returned her attention to Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Should I call you an ambulance?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s lips turned down, her arms crossing over her chest as she moped back to her nest of blankets on the couch.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha fought back a startled laugh. Rio was the picture of control in nearly every aspect of her life. To see such a drastically different figure was almost alarming. Agatha set the groceries on the kitchen table and walked to sit down beside Rio as she tucked herself back into her pile.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Is it terminal?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s expression fell further and she looked away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You didn’t have to come.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha snickered and dug under the blankets for Rio’s feet so she could pull them onto her lap.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I wouldn’t miss this if you paid me.” She scratched lightly at Rio’s calf. “Who knew Agent Vidal was a massive baby.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio, instead of pulling away or snapping back, slid lower and pressed her legs further into Agtha’s lap.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Did you bring me gatorade?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha grinned, her heart soft at the hopeful look in Rio’s eyes. She wanted to make fun of her, to pick at the sensitive layers, but she couldn’t bring herself to do anything but feed into it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Three whole flavors.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s smile was worth the decision to skip the jokes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“And soup?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Chicken noodle.” Rio’s face fell and Agatha laughed. “And lentil soup you absolute freak.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio interlocked their fingers then, her eyes falling back to the television, and proceeded to use her pout to coerce Agatha into doing her will.</i>
</p><p>The first test of Agatha’s will to resist Rio had been an utter failure on her part, and a sure sign on Rio’s that she had Agatha wrapped around her finger.</p><p>From then on, on the incredibly rare occasions that Rio got sick or hurt, Agatha would find herself heeding the whims of a petulant, barely-functioning brat. They’d curl into each other and watch old cartoons, and Agatha would cook and clean and provide endless back scratches until Rio passed out or got better.</p><p>She figured she’d play the part now before she was asked.</p><p>Searching Rio’s pantry and fridge yielded far more results than Agatha’s had for Rio. She gathered a pair of russet potatoes and, on the same shelf, found barely used bags of all kinds of flour besides regular. Agatha rolled her eyes, retrieved the almond and oat flower, and set both on the counter. She wandered through the baking cabinet for vanilla extract and baking powder, then tugged the fridge door open and located the eggs and almond milk.</p><p>She had just finished measuring and pouring the ingredients into a mixing bowl when her phone began to blare. She glanced at it to find Rio’s number, her name still replaced by a skull, staring back at her. She was smiling before she answered.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything for several moments.</p><p>
<i>”Are you downstairs?”</i>
</p><p>Agatha could hear the restraint in Rio’s voice.</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>
<i>”Okay.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s adoration for this woman, while returning in waves and surges, seemed to triple. She felt so much of it that it hurt.</p><p>“Can I get you something?”</p><p>
<i>”No, it’s okay.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha looked at the batter as she mixed. She felt like she was bottle feeding a baby goat.</p><p>“Do you want to come down?”</p><p>Rio sighed and it held just the smallest twinge of self-pity.</p><p>
<i>“Yeah.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“Okay, be careful.”</p><p>She waited to see how Rio would respond. Instead there was just silence, like Rio was trying to work against her basest of wounded instincts. Agatha laughed.</p><p>“I’ll come up. Would you like me to call the medics? Get the stair chair again?”</p><p>Rio hung up the phone and Agatha set the whisk down in the bowl. She made her way back up the steps and slowed to a stop at Rio’s door.</p><p>Rio was sitting against the headboard with a frown on her face and her hands held in her lap. She seemed like she was attempting to feign normalcy, like she was fully aware that what they were doing here, what they’d been doing the past few days had been like slapping duct tape on a crack in a dam.</p><p>Agatha felt it too. Felt the split of wanting to do this right and wanting to do this right now. She walked to her side and held out a hand.</p><p>“Come on, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio’s facade fractured, her eyes widening at the endearment. She looked like she might cry and Agatha gripped her elbow to keep her moving.</p><p>This time–unlike Rio’s mild cold where she’d asked Agatha to climb through a window– Rio was clearly in a serious amount of pain. Her startled expression twisting as she pulled her feet over the edge of the bed. Agatha helped her stand and Rio sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Ribs or shoulder?”</p><p>Rio spoke through clenched teeth.</p><p>“Ribs.”</p><p>Agatha hummed her acknowledgement and turned Rio to the bathroom. This time, Rio didn’t refuse. She stepped past the banana plant, the leaves tickling the top of her head, and brushed her teeth with her uninjured arm.</p><p>She didn’t hold onto Agatha as they headed toward the stairs but she hesitated at the top.</p><p>“I’ve changed my mind. How soon until the stair chair arrives?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and stepped back up to insert herself as a support. They moved down the steps slowly and Rio held her breath for a large portion of it. When they reached the landing, Rio gasped.</p><p>“For fucks sake.”</p><p>Agatha walked beside her to the kitchen table and helped her sit down before scouring the medicine cabinet for Advil. She poured Rio a glass of ice water and set both on the table. She cleared her throat. She pulled an ice pack from the freezer, one with a large, velcro strap, and helped Rio hook it around her torso.</p><p>“Are they displaced?”</p><p>Rio grunted out a negative as she tried to relax in the chair.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to fuss over her, didn’t want to hover, and she returned to the counter to continue mixing.</p><p>When she searched for a pan, her eyes fell on the charred remains still in the sink. She reached forward and lifted the pan into Rio’s view.</p><p>“This makes me worried about what you’ve been eating.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, her frown deepening.</p><p>“I was seasoning the pan.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted and she glanced at the husk of bacon that was still glued to the metal.</p><p>“Oh with charcoal? Is that a new trend? Charcoal and soap suds?” She shrugged. “I have to say, I’m not certain I’m on board.”</p><p>Rio groaned, the sound hitching as it rattled her ribs.</p><p>“I’m unwell and I’m being harassed in my own kitchen.”</p><p>Agatha grinned as she scrubbed the metal clean, the two days of soaking enough to make it an easier job.</p><p>She set the clean pan on the stove and peered at the coffee maker they’d received for their wedding.</p><p>“This was from Bohner, right?”</p><p>Rio huffed.</p><p>“Best thing he ever did.”</p><p>Agatha grinned as she fiddled with the machine, her hands falling into practiced motions as she set about making two cups. She finished and popped open the fridge to find Rio’s inordinately expensive creamer to pour in.</p><p>When she placed it on the table, Rio was watching her with an expression that sent a pang through Agatha’s heart. She cleared her throat and returned to mixing the batter. She twisted the stove on, pulled down a plate, prepared several tabs of butter, and only then did she return her gaze to Rio.</p><p>Rio who was still watching her. Rio who still had <i>that</i> look on her face.</p><p>Agatha felt a flare of panic and veered away from another intense conversation with a prod of humor.</p><p>“If you cry I’m leaving.”</p><p>It did the trick. Rio’s soft expression churned into defensiveness, her brows drawing together.</p><p>“I’m not going to cry. What the fuck?”</p><p>Agatha huffed and dropped a tab of butter in the pan and watched it melt.</p><p>“I’m just saying. If you do–”</p><p>Rio sputtered.</p><p>“I’m not!”</p><p>Agatha grinned as she scooped up enough batter to make a truly massive pancake.</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>Rio stewed in silence and Agatha waited until the bubbles had overtaken the raw side before she flipped it. Out of practice, the batter splattered across the edge of the pan and the glass of the stove. She subtly wiped it away.</p><p>Rio snorted, then groaned.</p><p>“God, oww– I saw that. You’re making a mess.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Do you want to starve or shut up?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, the sound catching.</p><p>“Okay, please don’t be funny, I can't.”</p><p>Agatha slipped the pancake from the pan and poured in the next.</p><p>“Like asking water to be dry.”</p><p>Rio sighed and Agatha felt a gentle warmth, a simmer of easy hope floating in her chest as she finished creating a too-tall stack of almond and oat pancakes. She tugged open the pantry and searched. And searched.</p><p>“Rio, where’s your syrup?”</p><p>“I don’t have syrup.”</p><p>Agatha turned around, her brows lifting.</p><p>“Oh. And you waited until I’d spent thirty minutes making you food to tell me that?”</p><p>Rio flushed.</p><p>“I wasn’t really thinking about it.” She frowned. “I’m in pain.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and grabbed the honey.</p><p>“You’re about to be in more.” She returned to the fridge and pulled out a half-eaten carton of blueberries, an unopened package of raspberries, and set them on the counter. “You’re about to be out of fruit too.”</p><p>Rio’s voice was nearly a whine.</p><p>“But what about my yogurt?”</p><p>Agatha poured the berries into the still-warm pan, added the honey, a touch of vanilla extract, and returned her attention to Rio.</p><p>“I’ll get you more yogurt.”</p><p>Rio’s brows rose but she refrained from answering as she lifted her coffee to her lips.</p><p>By the time Agatha was finished, a berry compote-ish sauce to pour over the pancakes, she carried them to the table.</p><p>Rio shifted.</p><p>“Patio room?”</p><p>Agatha’s breathing stuttered. She still hadn’t seen it, hadn’t peered into the room that they’d spent years of their lives lounging within.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio carefully stood, face tense, and began a slow path toward the hallway. She’d left her coffee.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah, of course, no, I’ll carry everything. Don’t you worry.”</p><p>Rio frowned back at her.</p><p>“I’m injured.”</p><p>Agatha moved ahead of Rio despite her hesitation, her eyes flicking around the hallway as she stepped into it.</p><p>The pictures were endless, proudly placed, prominent; Nicky next to his ‘treehouse,’ standing with the widest smile beside the sticks he’d leaned against a tree in the backyard, Agatha and Rio at a banquet for their cohort a year after graduation, Nicky holding Wanda’s hand as they stood atop a large boulder; she was pointing toward a bird, Agatha remembered. Nicky had been enthralled.</p><p>He’d taken on Rio’s love of camping, much to Agatha’s chagrin, and they’d made a tradition of going with Wanda and Vision whenever their time-off happened to align; weather permitting.</p><p>She stared at his chunky boots he’d insisted on wearing because they matched Agatha’s. They were tan and purple and he’d barely been able to walk in them for the first several attempts. He’d sobbed when they’d attempted to put him in tennis shoes.</p><p>Rio came to a stop beside her.</p><p>“He fell every three steps for a week and wasn’t phased because they made him ‘tough like mama.’”</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp breath.</p><p>“He was the toughest kid.” She smiled. “Definitely tougher than you. He barely slowed down when he had a cold.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled up even as she pushed on, her steps fragile.</p><p>They turned into the mudroom and Rio pushed through the screen– a cat door installed near the bottom– that led to the covered patio.</p><p>Agatha forgot herself for a moment.</p><p>It had always been beautiful, a place for comfort and rest, but Rio had turned it into a sanctuary. Rio’s new rug was the color of the sunset, of warm clay and ochre. The removable doors were perfectly clean, no little handprints to smudge the glass, and sunlight drenched the space. The furniture was the same, if more worn, and Agatha ached to curl into the large, wicker chairs and sink into the sage cushions.</p><p>Plants dominated the space. A massive fiddle leaf fig stood in the corner, its leaves splayed out as it curled toward the sun. Succulents, lavender plants, coleuses, peperomias, begonias, pathos; all of them sewn into the tapestry the room created. There were dozens of air plants hanging from twine in mismatched glass jars and vials.</p><p>Set near the largest window was a cat tree that blended well with the plants and Boggle was currently curled into the tallest platform, his body almost too large for it. He barely acknowledged them.</p><p>Agatha turned toward the far corner and smiled.</p><p>“Your hammock.”</p><p>Rio flushed slightly.</p><p>“I like to feel like I’m camping even though I can’t find the time to go.”</p><p>The hammock was attached to two of the metal supports, metal rings drilled in to give it something to attach to. It was sun-bleached and old, but the synthetic, orange material had held up well.</p><p>“It’s beautiful, Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiled like she agreed. She stared at her creation with a proud shine in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha loved her hopelessly.</p><p>“You don’t camp anymore?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her shine dimming slightly.</p><p>“I think going alone lost its appeal a long time ago.”</p><p>______</p><p>
<i>Agatha sat glumly in the fading sun, eyes on the ring of stones around what would become their campfire.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was kneeling beside it with a pile of twigs to her right and four plastic-wrapped bundles of firewood at her back. She was smug and her lips were twitching with the effort of hiding it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha glared into the side of her face with hopes of setting her on fire.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m cold.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio bit the side of her cheek as she piled twigs and a newspaper at the center of the pit.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I told you to bring an extra jacket.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha slumped further into the camping chair and grimaced as the edge of it cut into her thighs.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d lost the bet fair and square according to Rio. In reality, she’d lost the bet while cheating and that made this situation far worse. Projection was always a good defense.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I know you cheated.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio finished placing the firewood over the piled tinder and finally looked at her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha, you spent the entire game stealing money from the bank.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha feigned offense, her mouth dropping open.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I did not!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She had.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio rolled her eyes and turned further toward her, her fingers lacing together against her knees.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I told you not to challenge me to Monopoly of <i>all</i> games. Grim and I had access to the shittiest fucking copy you can imagine, but we played it almost every day for two years.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hated losing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s all luck.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio chuckled as she focused in on the tinder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Whatever you need to believe to help you sleep tonight. It’ll be pretty cold. Are you sure you don’t want my coat?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha did want her coat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m sure.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Smoke began to rise and Agatha hid her grudging admiration behind her frown. It probably wasn’t even that hard to make a fire.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio leaned down, back arching as she blew a slow stream of air into the flickering embers. Agatha stared at her ass and it made her mood marginally brighter.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Once the flames jumped up slightly, the peaks of it licking the larger sticks, Rio stood and stared down proudly. She turned and smiled at Agatha, and Agatha was caught in the innocent joy there. Rio in nature was a softer creature; seemingly untouched by the lashes she’d been dealt by a shitty world. It was likely enough to balance out Agatha’s distaste for being stuck without the luxury of air conditioning and a bed, but she’d die before she told Rio that.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio walked toward her car, the black paint and wheels coated in a fine layer of dust, and popped the trunk. She pulled out a large cooler, several smaller bags, and the two backpacks that carried all of their gear; bringing each one to set closer to the fire. She returned one last time and pulled out a large, puffy, black coat. Agatha’s coat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you still want to sit there in your sweatshirt or would you like to stop pouting?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stood and snatched the coat. She shoved her frozen arms into the sleeves and felt immediately better. She narrowed her eyes at Rio, unsure if her expression was even visible as night truly fell.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I wasn’t pouting.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio grinned, not rising to the challenge, and gripped the edges of the coat to pull Agatha closer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m going to ask you something. It’ll be really hard. You might want to refuse just to spite me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha softened at Rio’s proximity, at the playful look in her eye.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I do plan to refuse.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded, feigning gravitas.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Of course.” She leaned in, pressing her lips to Agatha’s once before pulling back. “I really love camping, Agatha. Can you try to have fun? I’ll do everything, you don’t even need to help me set up the tent.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha could see she meant it; under the layer of Rio’s easy smile and humor, this was important to her. She huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fine.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s answering smile was brighter than the growing fire. She kissed Agatha again, leaned down to the cooler, and retrieved a beer that she pressed into Agatha’s hands.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay, sit down, relax, and make a note of all the things you’ll want to bring next time to make this more manageable.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes widened.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Next time!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio pretended not to hear her as she lifted a square bag and began to meander in the dark a little ways from the fire. A headlamp came on and Agatha bit her lip to stop her smile at the sight before her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio, in dusty jeans, worn, brown boots, and a heavy flannel, was crouched down over a stack of synthetic canvas and metal poles. Her headlight stood out from her forehead and she looked like a fucking dork.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha cracked her beer, significantly happier now that she was warm, and sat down with the full intention to only have a little bit of fun.<br/>___</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was crying, her eyes blurry as she laughed harder than she had in ages. She couldn’t breathe, and she was certain she was going to pass out before she found a way to use her lungs again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was in a similar state, curled limply over both sleeping bags, her eyes closed as she laughed silently.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They were hammered. They’d drank an entire twelve pack of PBR as they sat beside the fire, Agatha easing into and past the buzz as Rio forced her to skewer her own hot dog on a roasting stick and hold it over the flames.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was hungry enough that she was actually looking forward to it. Rio had finished first and was in the process of adding condiments, when Agatha’s fell off of her stick and into the fire.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d both stared, Agatha in complete dismay, until Rio had begun cackling.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hadn’t thought, hadn’t questioned herself. She’d picked up Rio’s perfectly made hot dog and threw it into the fire too.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The extended silence, followed by both of them wheezing into a fit of laughter, had carried the tone for the rest of the night.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio managed to gather herself momentarily, heaving as she tried to speak through her gasps, her head lolling back on the sleeping bag.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I– I… can’t…. believe you just threw it…. into the– the fire… with… absolutely… no… hesitation! That’s— insane.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha held her stomach, the pain there nearing unbearable as she pulled in a lungful of air and lost it almost immediately.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh.. my god…. sh–shut the… fuck… up.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio groaned and took several near-violent, deep breaths, letting out little “whoooos” as she tried to stabilize her breathing. Agatha followed suit, her hand wiping at her eyes. They’d nearly succeeded when Rio giggled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The next fit of laughter continued on until Agatha reached out and slapped weakly at Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay….shhh….. shhhhh. Please.. be quiet…. Oh my god.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time they’d stopped their cackling, both of them nearly boneless, Agatha was almost certain she was in love with Rio Vidal. It wasn’t nearly as frightening as she’d thought it would be. She reached out and linked her hand with Rio’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I am going to be really grumpy tomorrow when I wake up hungover and have to piss in the dirt.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio grinned sleepily.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Thanks for the head’s up.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I wanted to say sorry now. I’m not going to say it tomorrow.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio adjusted slightly, the sleeping bags a mess beneath them, and tugged at Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I understand. Come here.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shifted closer, letting herself be tucked into Rio’s body, her head pressing under Rio’s jaw. She pressed her lips against Rio’s throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Shouldn’t we get in the sleeping bags?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded against her but did nothing to initiate the arduous task of moving something you were actively laying on.</i>
</p><p><i>They fell asleep like that, Agatha still in her puffy coat, Rio in her jeans, and they made it about an hour before they were shivering and drunkenly shifting around in the dark to stuff themselves into their sleeping bags.</i><br/>______</p><p>Agatha had set down the plates and helped Rio sit in the spot that she’d worn in with years of favoritism. Agatha returned to the kitchen for their coffees. She hesitated for only a moment before claiming the cushion that had once been her own.</p><p>Rio was breathing slowly, her body leaning against the backrest, and she looked longingly at the plate sitting on the table.</p><p>Agatha blew out a breath and selected the largest pancakes, drizzled them with the compote, and placed the plate in Rio’s hands.</p><p>“A literal child.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes gleamed as she rested the plate precariously on her chest and painstakingly cut herself a piece. She looked pathetic and Agatha couldn’t breathe.</p><p>“If you make me cut up your food for you I’m going to start having regrets.”</p><p>Rio pulled her plate closer and pouted as she struggled to cut herself another piece.</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio until it became hard to watch. She groaned loudly, far more dramatically than she needed to, and reached for the plate.</p><p>Rio twisted away instinctively and the plate nearly dropped as she sucked in sharply.</p><p>Agatha caught it, her feigned irritation slipping away as Rio hissed through clenched teeth. Her eyes squeezed shut as the pain coursed through her.</p><p>Agatha set the plate down and reached out, her fingers pressing softly against the furrow in Rio’s brow.</p><p>“Breathe.” She pushed Rio’s hair from her forehead. “Just breathe through it.”</p><p>Rio’s face slackened, her chest rising and falling slowly after a few moments. She turned her head into Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Agatha let her nails trail along Rio’s scalp, scratching lightly, before curling behind her ear and pressing her palm against the warmth of Rio’s jaw and neck. For a moment she simply stared, her thumb gentle on Rio’s cheekbone. The motions and the words fell into place as if there’d been no break from the last time Agatha had been allowed to truly take care of Rio to this moment.</p><p>“You’re okay, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio’s expression pinched again, but this time Agatha saw moisture gather in her lashes as her jaw trembled.</p><p>Agath’s chest jumped, her free hand cupping the other side of Rio’s face.</p><p>“Do you want to lay down?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved into a deep frown and she sniffed.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha ran her thumbs under Rio’s eyes to catch the few tears that fell.</p><p>“I was mostly kidding about leaving if you cried.”</p><p>Rio let out a wet huff of laughter, her chin dropping.</p><p>“Shut up. I know.” She pulled back and wiped at her own eyes. “I’m really okay.”</p><p>Rio leaned away and Agatha felt the withdrawal like a dull thump against her chest. She’d overstepped. This wasn’t five years ago. This was now, and they had canyons between them still needing to be traversed.</p><p>Rio blew out her cheeks, her mouth opening to speak, but the sound that left was nearly a sob. Agatha barely refrained from reaching again, her fingers tingling with inaction as she searched for the right words.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to–”</p><p>Rio groaned, her head leaning back as she reached out toward Agatha’s and caught her hand.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio steadied her voice. “The only person that’s been around for these moments the past several years has been Wanda. She’s more the ‘ply you with medicine and supplements’ type.” She squeezed Agatha’s hand. “I’d forgotten how good—” she lifted a finger tiredly and motioned, “...how good this felt. I got overwhelmed. I’m not upset.”</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip.</p><p>“I know we keep saying we’ll talk. We keep trying to talk. But I don’t mind if we don’t for a little bit longer.”</p><p>Rio peaked one eye open, her brow lifting.</p><p>“I’m not in any shape to be doing that.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“No. I don’t mean sex. I mean…” She trailed off, uncertain, before forging ahead. “If you want to make popcorn and watch your stupid cartoons and play a game. Or something.”</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>“Or something?”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, immediate regret filling her.</p><p>“Never mind. I’ll send Wanda over with her supplements.”</p><p>Rio moaned dramatically, her hand tightening on Agatha’s.</p><p>“Please don’t. Last time she made a bone broth protein shake and I threw up.” Rio moaned again, this time quieter. “Just leave me here to rot.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she retrieved Rio’s plate.</p><p>“No. You’re eating first. Then we’re maneuvering you to the couch and we’re paying out of our asses to watch Looney Toons.”<br/>______</p><p>It took three google searches and the purchase of two streaming services to access the specific cartoons Rio was set on watching. Agatha had piled blankets around her to support her sides and allow her to relax. She’d made popcorn, brought in a massive bottle of water, and buried herself in the couch beside Rio.</p><p>She found herself watching Rio more than Foghorn Leghorn, a particular favorite for sick days. Every time Rio laughed too loudly at something that was arguably not funny, Agatha felt something like tranquility begin to soften her muscles and leaden her bones. For the first time she could remember, she felt blissfully content, her mind quiet.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha still sat deep in the cushions of the sofa, her eyes aimed in the direction of the television, but unseeing the grainy footage of the Roadrunner bright on the screen. The light coming through the windows was a warm orange.</p><p>Rio had fallen asleep sometime after the start of The Bugs Bunny show, her head leaning heavily on Agatha’s shoulder, and Agatha was not inclined to wake her.</p><p>The high intensity of emotion from the case, from being exposed to radiation, to Rio getting hurt, to waking up in this house once more, had eased away for a time. The familiarity of Rio being the worst patient, the biggest baby, had allowed Agatha to push aside any thoughts that might have sent her spiraling.</p><p>Thoughts about <i>how</i> she was supposed to do this, if she’d be able to do this, if she’d hurt Rio again without intending to. She chewed on the skin of her lip, worrying it between her teeth.</p><p>What if Rio decided it wasn’t worth the risk? She’d said she hadn’t seen any other path forward, but what if they stepped onto it and nothing clicked? Their relationship from their first run at Quantico up until Nicky got sick had felt like an inevitability, like Agatha and Rio, the two of them, could do nothing but choose one another.</p><p>What if they weren’t made to weather hardship and the distinct challenges that lay before them? The tough conversations, the regaining of trust, the overcoming of grief and anger and disappointment that seems to vacuum them hollow on their bad days.</p><p>Agatha felt the surge of something looming and cold, the icy fingers of fear that had no mercy for her desperate grabs at happiness, at anything other than sorrow.</p><p>She swallowed against the sensation and looked down at Rio’s slack expression. She was still bundled in blankets and she had a few bits of popcorn scattered across her chest. Agatha closed her eyes and drew in several breaths.</p><p>With careful movements, she adjusted Rio’s head to lean against the back of the couch. She gently extracted herself and let her feet guide her toward the stairs. She paused outside of Nicky’s room when she reached the top landing and breathed.</p><p>Vicious thoughts careened through her skull, judgements and accusations: that she wanted to leave him behind, that she didn’t deserve to.</p><p>She shook her head because that wasn’t it, that wasn’t what she wanted, but the voice persisted like an oppressive wave, a drowning of reason that caught her so off guard that her recently attained coping methods ceased to exist.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe very well at all. She moved numbly into the master bedroom, raided Rio’s closet, and found the borrowed tennis shoes from two days before.</p><p>Was it wrong to move on from any of it? Was it the burden of a mother who lost her child to feel that suffering in excruciating measure, to account for the loss of innocence and brightness in the world? It almost made sense. Maybe the shell of the woman she’d been for the past five years was serving a purpose.  Maybe she was not meant to belong to herself anymore. Maybe her body and her mind were not for her, but a vessel meant to carry such tragedy until it was buried in the ground.</p><p>Agatha moved quickly down the steps, her stomach churning, and slipped out the front door in a state of severe dissociation.</p><p>She didn’t pause to stretch, her stride picking up as she reached the bottom of the porch, shoes whispering through the slightly tall grass of the yard. Her body felt tilted, off-balance, as it tried to orient itself to activity from hours of being sedentary.</p><p>She hit the pavement, felt the twinge of age in her knees as they protested the hard surface, and set out to burn through the suffocating disposition of her mind.</p><p>She ran hard, pushed herself to the point of near dizziness, but this time she could find no escape. There was no glimpse of light, no understanding that her thoughts were falsities. They solidified like magma to sulfurous rock and Agatha was losing the ability to fight against the blanket of harsh truths.</p><p>She was, in her nature, a coward. She’d always been afraid. She’d never been strong enough to stand up to her mother. She’d masked her fear with indifference and abrasion, but it had always just been a mask.</p><p>She’d taken Rio, a self-sufficient, guarded, aspiring agent, and dragged her down, cut her open, bared her heart to tragedy. Only to leave her to stitch herself together alone. And when she finally had, when she’d done the work and extended an olive branch to Agatha, Agatha had done it all over again.</p><p>She’d bulldozed through years of therapy and took what did not belong to her. She’d let her words and actions raze Rio, tear her open once more, and then she’d had the audacity to worm her way back, to put herself in a place of comfort she did not deserve.</p><p>Rio was special. Rio was good and she deserved good.</p><p>Agatha was not good.</p><p>Agatha ran for nearly an hour. She lost track of the miles and the route until she was in an unfamiliar neighborhood with mansions that stood starkly against a now-darkening sky.</p><p>Agatha slowed, her heart scrabbling to keep up, her breathing more like a violent wheeze that rattled in her chest.</p><p>She put her hands on her hips, dropped her head back, and she cried.</p><p>She needed Wanda. Or Alder. She pressed shaking hands to the sides of the leggings she borrowed and frowned. She tried to remember if she’d brought her phone, if she might have dropped it, but the haze of the past hour made her memory finicky and dishonest.</p><p>Agatha heaved in lungfuls of air and looked around, trying to place herself so that she could figure out how to get back. A seeping silver of sanity returned as a mild concern filled her.</p><p>She didn’t know how long she’d been gone, didn’t know if Rio was awake. The thought that Rio might assume she’d left her without a word pierced Agatha’s chest and wouldn’t dislodge itself.</p><p>She began to walk, her eyes peeled for any familiar landmark or sign. It took her five minutes to find one and she grimaced as she realized she was nearly a thirty-minute walk from the house and currently going the wrong direction.</p><p>She doubled back and picked up her pace, her legs nearly jello as she half-walked, half-jogged back.</p><p>It was entirely dark outside by the time she reached the street. Her heart dropped.</p><p>Wanda’s car was sitting in the driveway, and there, sitting in the sage rocking chair, was Wanda herself.</p><p>Agatha expected anger. She was convinced she deserved it, her mind still prickling with shame.</p><p>Instead, she noted a lilt of concern on Wanda’s face.</p><p>Agatha slowed at the bottom of the steps and stared. She didn’t know what to say.</p><p>Wanda stood and met her where she was at.</p><p>“Talk to me, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha felt the crack of a dam in her chest.</p><p>“Am I supposed to be sad forever? For Nicky? If I carry it, does that mean Rio doesn’t have to?”</p><p>In retrospect, the words didn’t make sense. At that moment, she believed them entirely.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened, her hands reaching out to pull Agatha to her chest so tightly that neither of them could breathe.</p><p>“No, you idiot.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and it was truly a sob. She pressed her face into Wanda’s shoulder and let her weight transfer further to the other woman.</p><p>Agatha pulled back and wiped her eyes.</p><p>“Fuck. Did Rio call? I left my phone—“</p><p>Wanda lifted said phone and passed it over.</p><p>“It had fallen between the couch cushions.” She glanced toward the house. “I called, actually. The boys were very adamant that they come and visit Rio. They made her cards and helped Vis bake some of the scones Rio likes.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart completed a pirouette in her chest.</p><p>“They’re inside?”</p><p>Wanda looked like she was attempting to gauge Agatha’s reaction.</p><p>“When I called, Rio said you’d left while she was asleep.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, the shame doubling down.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to—“</p><p>Wanda squeezed her arm.</p><p>“I know, Agatha. You know how Rio gets when she’s not feeling well. She’s grumpy.”</p><p>“But I should have known—“</p><p>Wanda shook her head.</p><p>“Stop. I can literally see you beating yourself up. I’m not worried about you going for a run. I’m worried about why you went. And what your brain is telling you.”</p><p>Agatha hated Wanda just a little bit. Even the recognition by another person that Agatha’s careen into panic was not only predictable, but also likely distorted, peeled back the veil just enough for her to breathe.</p><p>She blew her hair from her face. It was stringy with dried sweat and she probably looked feral.</p><p>“It’s telling me only good, productive things.”</p><p>Wanda snorted.</p><p>“Right. And Vision is an excellent storyteller.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, the overlay of dread sloughing off of her slightly.</p><p>“That’s fucking rude.”</p><p>Wanda grinned back and released Agatha’s arm.</p><p>“Do you want to go in? The boys are very excited and confused that you and Rio know each other.” She looked at the rocking chairs. “We can also sit down for a moment if you need it.”</p><p>Agatha was itching to see Rio, to subvert any thoughts she might be having about Agatha leaving her alone.</p><p>“I’m surprised they don’t know anything.”</p><p>Wanda’s brow raised.</p><p>“Are you? They’re the most inquisitive children on earth. You don’t think, if I’d told them, one of them would have asked a question or two hundred you didn’t want to answer?”</p><p>Agatha blew out her cheeks as she took the steps toward the front door.</p><p>“Fair point.”</p><p>As she placed her hand on the door, Agatha heard the soft squeals of laughter coming from the twins. The veil peeled back further, the blackout curtains splitting to let in light.</p><p>She twisted the knob and stepped inside. As soon as she became visible, both boys— now currently on either side of Rio— gasped and launched themselves from the couch.</p><p>It was clear that the movement was jarring enough to Rio to feel it. Her face tensed but otherwise remained neutral. She didn’t quite look at Agatha and Agatha felt it harshly.</p><p>Billy hit Agatha’s legs.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>The double F in her name brought Agatha further back from the brink as she placed a hand on Billy’s back.</p><p>Tommy was quicker, offering a one-armed hug to her thigh before he moved back toward Rio. Agatha noted that Vision was sitting in the L of the couch, his straight-leg jeans and striped sweater standing out against the cushion.</p><p>He smiled at her as she walked, Billy attached, toward the couch.</p><p>Rio finally looked at her and Agatha swallowed. She lifted her phone ruefully.</p><p>“I didn’t realize it wasn’t on me.”</p><p>Rio’s shuttered expression faltered and a relief near desperation became visible.</p><p>“I figured.”</p><p>It was an admission of overreaction, however slight, and a needed reminder that they were okay.</p><p>Agatha was careful as she sat down on Rio’s other side. Billy climbed up next to her, then proceeded to kneel across her thighs, his sharp bones digging in like the paws of a cat.</p><p>“Auntie Rio told us she got to ride in a king chair down lots of stairs.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“A king chair? Did she tell you she was also asleep through most of it?”</p><p>Billy gasped and Tommy looked imploringly at Rio.</p><p>Rio shot her a glare and continued her story.</p><p>“I was not asleep. I was a little bit drowsy. Besides, it’s way cooler to go down in a chair. Agatha had to walk.”</p><p>Tommy nodded.</p><p>“That is cooler.”</p><p>Wanda sat down beside Vision and seemed content to watch this play out.</p><p>Billy shifted, the pain of his knees in the muscle of her thigh nearly unbearable.</p><p>“Agatha?” He looked up, his eyebrow furrowing like he had a very deep thought. “Do you live with Auntie Rio now?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened.</p><p>“No— I just— I was making sure she was okay.”</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>“Okay. So you’re coming back?”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly.</p><p>“I’ll be back. Have you been visiting Scratchy?”</p><p>Billy jolted in excitement and Agatha nearly doubled over as he slid off of her to run to his dad.</p><p>“Dad! Let me show her!”</p><p>Vision opened his phone and pressed it into Billy’s hand.</p><p>Billy ran back and Agatha subtly blocked him from launching into her again. He clambered onto the couch.</p><p>“I taught him a trick!”</p><p>Agatha watched as the camera followed Billy, the boy running from one wall of the guest house and watching with bright eyes as Señor Scratchy bounced after him. Billy giggled and sprinted to the other wall, and some meandering moments later, Scratchy hopped in the same general direction.</p><p>It looked like a coincidence rather than a trick, but Agatha nodded solemnly.</p><p>“That is very impressive work, Billy.”</p><p>He beamed and then leaned forward.</p><p>“Auntie Rio, have you met Scratchy?”</p><p>Rio smiled, her eyes panning to Agatha for a brief moment.</p><p>“I have! He’s very sweet.”</p><p>The visit continued similarly into the evening, both boys bouncing topics of conversation around, some questions cutting very close to open wounds.</p><p>Agatha found herself staring often, watching the easy way Rio engaged with the boys, the genuine, warm smile tinged with devastating loss.</p><p>Rio looked at Tommy and Billy with intention, with understanding that time was fleeting and fickle and cruel. The recognition of it burned in Agatha’s nose and throat and she felt herself considering what Nicky would have been like right now. Would he have been interested in the boys, would he have sat beside Wanda and Vision and watched?</p><p>Agatha was running on a very, very fine thread of sanity. The distortions, the could-have-beens, the reconnection that felt both impossible and easy; all making themselves known in the pulsing thump of Agatha’s chest and the harsh clench of her jaw.</p><p>Around eight, Wanda alerted the boys that they had five more minutes, and both fell into a state of disarray. Tommy’s sleepy eyes flooded with tears, his voice wavering as he’d clambered into Rio’s lap. She’d gone white as a sheet, her jaw clenching as he bumped into her ribs and settled his weight on them.</p><p>Wanda moved to intervene but Rio shook her head. He’d cried for two minutes before promptly passing out, his mouth agape and his cheek squished into her shoulder.</p><p>Billy had become obstinate, his little arms crossing, his face pinching dramatically as he tried to bargain.</p><p>“But story time first!”</p><p>Vision held out a hand toward him and smiled.</p><p>“We can have story time at home.”</p><p>Billy let out a frustrated, near-tears groan and leaned further into Agatha’s side.</p><p>“And Agatha comes?”</p><p>Vision glanced at Agatha, then back.</p><p>“That is up to Agatha, Billy. If she doesn’t come tonight, you’ll still see her soon.”</p><p>He fell dramatically onto the couch and wailed, his fists pressing into his eyes, snot starting to run down his nose.</p><p>Agatha spoke softly, hoping the sound conveyed more than the words.</p><p>“I’ll come back tonight, Billy.”</p><p>Billy’s tantrum took a sharp left, his cry petering out, his watery eyes brightening despite the continued sniffles.</p><p>“Will you sit with me?”</p><p>Agatha thought about being squished between the two car seats.</p><p>“I can do that.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Wanda, the words unspoken but understood, and Wanda stood.</p><p>“Okay, Billy, let’s make sure there’s nothing in Agatha’s seat.”</p><p>Billy scrambled off of the couch and ran toward the door as Wanda followed. She glanced back at Vision and tilted her head toward Tommy.</p><p>Vision rose and offered Rio a painfully sincere smile.</p><p>“Tommy told me the other day that you were his third best friend.”</p><p>Rio smiled and she let Vision pull Tommy gently away from her. She looked somewhat nauseous.</p><p>“Bronze is still medaling.”</p><p>Tommy woke, adjusted, and fell back to sleep in Vision’s arms.</p><p>Vision grinned.</p><p>“Billy and Elise are his first best friends but Elise seems like a tenuous second.”</p><p>Rio pressed a hand against her abdomen.</p><p>“I’ll have to work harder then.”</p><p>Vision said his goodbyes and walked toward the door.</p><p>Rio’s head fell back and she let out a pained groan. Her breathing was strained.</p><p>“Tommy is so heavy.”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to bite back the offer to stay, to help. She needed to right the ship. She needed to talk to Alder and do her job, she needed to put in the work to make sure the oppressive fears that painted the inside of her skull did not come to fruition.</p><p>“I can help you up the stairs before I go.”</p><p>Rio’s lips pursed.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha slipped her arm beneath Rio’s and gently lifted them both from the couch. She could feel Rio’s muscles trembling with effort and she stayed in place, the warmth of their sides radiating into one another as they walked toward the stairs.</p><p>It was slow moving, Rio’s ribs aggravated by a weight crushing into them. Agatha tried not to take it personally that Rio was putting on a brave face, that the sheer amount of pain she knew she was in was being kept under wraps.</p><p>She waited while Rio brushed her teeth and then helped her into the bed.</p><p>“I want to stay, you know? I just—“</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“I know, Agatha. It wouldn’t be— I know you can’t just stay here.” She closed her eyes and was quiet for so long that Agatha was only sure she was still awake due to the frown tugging at her lips. “I’m scared you won’t come back.”</p><p>Agatha sat down, her fingers sliding against Rio’s soft skin as she stroked her cheek.</p><p>“I will. I pro—“ Agatha’s words choked off. It felt wrong to make promises when the biggest one she’d ever made, she’d broken. “I’m going to come back. Maybe tomorrow? After work? We can try to have that conversation?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened, the dark brown so filled with worry and hope, and her cheeks puffed out as she blew out a breath.</p><p>“Okay.” Her head tilted to the side. “And today? What happened?”</p><p>Agatha’s heartbeat felt like static.</p><p>“Can we talk about that tomorrow too?”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>When Agatha stood, she regretted her decision entirely. It felt like a string that connected them through everything— their training, marriage, separation— had suddenly pulled taut. It felt like leaving would hurt; like leaving was wrong.</p><p>She gathered the string and tried to slacken it to no avail.</p><p>With only a moment of hesitance, Agatha leaned down and pressed her lips against Rio’s cheek. She lingered for too long: Rio smelled like home.</p><p>Fingers slid into the thick mane of Agatha’s hair and tangled at the nape of her neck when she pulled away. She felt herself tugged, felt Rio’s mouth on hers with a desperation that was mirrored and multiplied.</p><p>Agatha gasped weakly, her lips parting as Rio’s tongue teased but didn’t press. Agatha’s heartbeat pounded in her ears and throat as her abdomen clenched.</p><p>By the time Rio released her, Agatha was in a daze.</p><p>Rio looked pained, the fear still lingered, but she spoke with a confidence that Agatha clung to.</p><p>“I just wanted you to keep that in mind.”<br/>
_______</p><p>Agatha found herself sitting beside Wanda two hours later, both of them rocking on the porch swing of the guest house. They had polished off a bottle of wine together and were sitting in a pleasant buzz.</p><p>The boys had both fallen asleep in the car and it had only taken a minute of reading for them to fall back asleep once in their beds.</p><p>Vision had offered a game of chess and Wanda had groaned goodnaturedly and uncorked a Pinot.</p><p>As expected, Agatha was losing.</p><p>She stared at the position with an irritated frown. It was a relief to be using her full mind for a task, to be analytical and precise and decisive. Losing, however, was never an experience she enjoyed.</p><p>Sometimes she wondered if Vision was actually a computer.</p><p>She pushed her pawn to a3 to prevent the incoming pin.</p><p>Wanda was sitting at the table with a bowl of chips and her computer open, but her eyes rarely left the game. She crunched a stack in her mouth and tilted her head at the move.</p><p>“Can’t Vis just—“</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped up.</p><p>“Don’t finish that sentence or I’ll see how many chips fit in your mouth at once.”</p><p>Wanda blinked, Vision stared, and then both fell into a fit of laughter as Agatha glowered at the board.</p><p>Because yes, Vision just could. And Vision just did. And he didn’t need Wanda’s help in finding it.</p><p>Agatha waited until hope was lost, until Vision sacrificed his Queen and she saw the impending checkmate from six moves away, before resigning.</p><p>She stood with a scoff.</p><p>“I’m never playing with you again.”</p><p>Wanda had pushed the bowl to the side and she rose with the unfinished bottle of wine.</p><p>“You said that last time, right? And the time before?”</p><p>Vision set about putting away the pieces. He was never smug; Agatha wasn’t sure he had the capability. But he was pleased, and that was just as offensive to her.</p><p>“I’m moving out. I’ll be living in my car.”</p><p>Vision nodded solemnly.</p><p>“Understandable. If you need a location for parking, we have a rather sizable driveway.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p>“I hope your next batch of scones burn.”</p><p>Vision’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Oh dear.” He closed the clasp on his chess set. “The next batch was meant for you. Incredibly unfortunate.” He pulled his board under his arm and smiled at her. “Goodnight, Agatha.” He pressed a kiss to Wanda’s lips. “Goodnight, darling. Do try to come to bed soon.”</p><p>As he walked away, Wanda had tilted the bottle of wine toward the door. They’d settled into the porch swing, both of their legs rocking them slowly, and sat in an easy silence for several minutes.</p><p>Agatha felt her body decompressing, her chest loosening, her anxiety slipping into exhaustion.</p><p>“I got in my head.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, passing her the bottle.</p><p>“I know. It’s okay too, you know? The knowledge of how to manage our emotions and the actual practice of it doesn’t always come hand in hand.”</p><p>Agatha tilted the bottle against her lips. It was classless, drinking straight from the mouth, but it allowed Agatha to sink back into nostalgia. She passed it back.</p><p>Wanda’s lips curled up.</p><p>“God, do you remember when I moved back to DC and we started hanging out? The first time we closed a case together, you, Rio, and I sat on the floor in her living room and finished three bottles of wine without a glass in sight.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, her body softening to the alcohol.</p><p>“We were so fucking drunk. I think you suggested we have a threesome.”</p><p>Wanda laughed, her smile bright.</p><p>“I was joking. Mostly.”</p><p>Agatha barked out a laugh, her eyes closing as she leaned her head back.</p><p>“I remember I was the only one that had to go into work early the next day. I hated both of you.”</p><p>Wanda blew out a breath and handed the bottle over.</p><p>“You were lucky. I think I spent three hours curled over Rio’s toilet. At one point, she threw up in the bathtub.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“Jesus. Single-bathroom apartments should not host celebratory parties.” She picked at the paper label. “I threw up in my trash can at work.”</p><p>Wanda snorted.</p><p>“I know. Ralph heard you and thought it was so funny. He texted me and half of our cohort.”</p><p>That was news. Agatha looked over at Wanda’s smug expression.</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>“In between intimate moments with the porcelain, I told him that he should try ever having enough fun to do the same.” She huffed. “I spelled most of the words wrong but my point got across.”</p><p>Agatha grinned down at the peeled label.</p><p>“Maybe he took your advice.”</p><p>Wanda hummed her agreement, the two of the falling into a contemplative silence. Agatha stared at the sky, the clouds partially hiding the stars.</p><p>Wanda breathed out a sigh.</p><p>“I told you I learned so much from you as a mother, but I never told you how much I learned from you as a partner.”</p><p>Agatha felt the scoff before she could curb it. It was hard to consider herself good.</p><p>Wanda shook her head.</p><p>“Shut up and listen.”</p><p>“I didn’t say anything.”</p><p>Wanda shushed her loudly, giving a meaningful pause before continuing.</p><p>“You and Rio, even in the early days at Quantico where all of us were run ragged, always found a way to exist together.”</p><p>Agatha tried to understand what she meant, her brow furrowing.</p><p>“We didn’t really have to try.”</p><p>Wanda smiled.</p><p>“I know. You guys adapted to one another like breathing.”</p><p>Agatha stared, unseeing.</p><p>“I think Rio adapted. She moved where I moved. Her patience was extraordinary.”</p><p>“Agatha, your entire world changed for her. You softened every part of you so that she could get close and then you kept her there.” Wanda huffed. “When she came to Quantico, I knew she was going to be a success. She is the smartest fucking person I know. But she was…” Wanda trailed off. “She was alone. By choice, I know. But then she chose you. She found you so worthy of her attention and care and you never once made her regret that.”</p><p>“Wanda, I–”</p><p>“No. Ask her. Ask her if she regrets any part of meeting you. Of choosing you. Of waiting for you. She will say no.” Wanda turned toward her suddenly, her hands lifting, pressing Agatha’s cheeks together as she looked at her hard, her eyes glassy. “She will <i>always</i> choose you, Agatha. No matter what you do to her or what the world does to you both. The only thing you have to worry about is how you will choose her too. Do you understand?”</p><p>Agatha stared at Wanda’s flushed face and felt a gentle amusement in her chest. Her words were mumbled through her squished cheeks.</p><p>“I understand. You’re drunk.”</p><p>Wanda dropped her hands and shrugged.</p><p>“So what if I am. I have two children of my own and two adult children that seem dead set on flinging themselves through windows, being irradiated, and generally making stupid choices. They might be worse than the toddlers.”</p><p>Agatha laughed as a pang of gratitude throbbed in her chest.</p><p>“You really are putting in the work.” She swallowed her pride. “You’re a great friend, Wanda. Thank you for putting up with me despite… everything.”</p><p>Wanda waved dismissively.</p><p>“Please. Vision and I don’t have any other couple friends nearby. It’s purely for selfish reasons.”</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“Of course.”<br/>
_______</p><p>Agatha glanced up for the fourth time, her eyes narrowing in on the sound of William’s fingers where they drummed against the desk.</p><p>He caught her eye and flushed, his drumming falling silent.</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She waited a few moments, closed out the case file on her screen, and returned her attention to William. He looked like he was about to explode.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>He looked back up, his relief palpable, and she was reminded once more that he needed a less expressive face.</p><p>“Eddie has been acting weird.”</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Weird how?”</p><p>William, without invite, stood and rolled his chair over to her desk as if she’d agreed to a therapy session. He dropped down and sighed.</p><p>“I feel like he’s going to dump me.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows rose.</p><p>“What makes you say that?”</p><p>William pursed his lips and he leaned forward to pick up a stack of sticky notes. He began to idly run his finger along the edge, a quiet, repetitive flutter sounding.</p><p>“He’s been kind of distant this week?”</p><p>“Is that a question?”</p><p>William sighed.</p><p>“He’s been distant. We were supposed to have a movie night last night. I got everything set up and made our snacks and he texted me from work that he’d be home later than expected. He asked if we could do it today instead.”</p><p>Agatha waited for more. When nothing followed, she gave him a look.</p><p>“And?”</p><p>William crossed his arms.</p><p>“That’s basically it.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure she could get away with smacking the intern.</p><p>“There better be more or I’ll take your vape where you keep it in your desk and throw it out the window.”</p><p>William’s eyes shot toward his desk, then back to her alarmed.</p><p>“No! I need that. For my nerves.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“Tell me what else.”</p><p>William threw up a hand.</p><p>“I don’t know! I feel like he’s been on his phone a lot. And he got a package Monday that he didn’t even open. He just took it to our room.”</p><p>“What was it?”</p><p>William looked confused.</p><p>“I just said he didn’t open it.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, shrugged.</p><p>“I just figured you looked later.”</p><p>William’s confusion turned to shock.</p><p>“I’m not going to go through his things!”</p><p>“Because you trust him?”</p><p>“Obviously!”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her point made.</p><p>“So why don’t you just ask instead of spinning out?”</p><p>The irony was not lost on her.</p><p>William pulled off the top sticky note.</p><p>“I don’t want to know the answer.”</p><p>Agatha almost laughed.</p><p>“Did you consider it might be literally anything else before jumping to this conclusion?”</p><p>William frowned at her.</p><p>“I don’t enjoy you being logical.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth dropped open.</p><p>“Excuse me!” She reached out and snatched back her sticky notes. “I’m logical. Go back to your desk.”</p><p>“Wait! No, okay you’re so logical. The most logical. Can you help me please?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Maybe he’s going to propose.”</p><p>William blanched.</p><p>“We’re twenty!”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, leaning back in her chair as she realized this was turning into a longer conversation.</p><p>“Listen, Will. Has Eddie ever given you a reason to believe that something is wrong? Outside of this one week?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then stop assuming the worst. Just talk to him.”</p><p>William blew out his cheeks.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Agatha should have known that wasn’t going to be the end of the conversation. She turned back to her computer to pull a file Alice had sent to the entire team. She’d barely read the email’s greeting before Will was rolling into a new topic.</p><p>“How are things with you?”</p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p>“This is not a tit for tat situation. Go do the work you're paid for.”</p><p>Will scoffed.</p><p>“Barely.” He picked up another stack of sticky notes and began to fiddle. “How’s Director Vidal?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“And I’d know that, why?”</p><p>Will offered her a cheeky look, his brows lifting.</p><p>“You stayed behind when everyone left.”</p><p>Agatha pointedly did not look at him.</p><p>“Somebody needed to be present on the scene.”</p><p>Will chuckled.</p><p>“Okay. Sure.”</p><p>He kicked his feet into the floor to send himself back toward his own desk.</p><p>Agatha frowned into her computer screen and didn’t read a single word. Several minutes passed before she offered him a begrudging response.</p><p>“She’s recovering.”</p><p>She ignored Will’s wide grin as he noisily rounded his desk, the wheels of the chair clacking and bouncing off of the wood.<br/>
_____</p><p>The rest of the day was slow; normally, they were the kinds of days that Agatha hated. Today was a strange mix of needing a moment to breathe and feeling desperate to get back to Rio. It was similar to the feeling of leaving something important behind. After several days of close proximity, of relearning, of remembering, being without her made everything feel sterile.</p><p>Agatha was nearly chafing as lunch came around, her eyes flicking to her phone every thirty minutes. Then every ten. Now she was simply staring at it.</p><p>She huffed and pulled it into her hands.</p><p>She opened Rio’s contact, changed the skull emoji to her name, and typed out a message before she could overthink it.</p><p>
<i>How’s it going?</i>
</p><p>It showed as delivered and Agatha made the mistake of looking at the last message from Rio. The time stamp was from two years prior.</p><p>
<i>Just let me know if you’re okay. Please.</i>
</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips into a tight line.</p><p>She blocked the swell of a memory before it could overtake her, her chest tight as she waited for any kind of response. Three dots appeared. Agatha expected hesitation, but a message came through almost immediately.</p><p>
<i>Rio: Everything hurts and Boggle knocked over my plant. I can’t pick it up :(</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s chest surged, her lips pulling up.</p><p>
<i>I’ll pick it up when I come over</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: You’re coming then?</i>
</p><p>
<i>I said I would. Is that okay?</i>
</p><p>The response was so quick Agatha nearly laughed. She bit it back at the last moment, her eyes finding William working diligently across the office.</p><p>
<i>Rio: Yes. I want you to.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Okay. Can I get you anything?</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: Gatorade? The blue one.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: A frozen pizza.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: And a package of basswood blocks.</i>
</p><p>
Agatha reread the last message.
</p><p>
<i>What</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: The internet says the infirm should take up a hobby.</i>
</p><p>
<i>You’re not infirm. Where would I even get basswood blocks? Why do you need them?</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: I’m going to learn to whittle.</i>
</p><p>
<i>You’re not going to learn to whittle, Rio.</i>
</p><p>
Agatha’s heart nearly melted out of her chest at the photo response that followed.
</p><p>
 Rio was sitting in her nest of blankets on the couch with somewhat messy hair and one of Agatha’s old t-shirts rumpled on her chest. She was frowning pathetically at the camera, her lips turned down, her eyes sad.
</p><p>
Agatha typed back quickly.
</p><p>
<i>Stop that.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: But Agatha! I need basswood.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Oh my god, fine. I’ll buy you basswood. I’m not getting you a frozen pizza. You need real food.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: Okay :)</i>

<i>Rio, where the fuck do I buy basswood?</i>
</p><p>Agatha had been to Home Depot wandering around in her suit for thirty minutes because she refused to ask for help. When she’d finally swallowed her pride, the bored employee had led her to a section with monotone quips and comments about it being poor for construction and DIY projects.</p><p>The smallest pieces they’d had were 12” x 12” squares of plywood. Forty-eight pieces for one hundred and fifty dollars. She had walked away from the employee mid-sentence and left the store.</p><p>
<i>Rio: They say the best place to buy is online.</i>
</p><p>Agatha was going to strangle her. She was in the middle of saying so when another text came through.</p><p>
<i>Rio: Oh! Craft stores</i>
</p><p>Agatha growled and punched in the closest Michael’s.</p><p>An hour later, Agatha was driving to Rio with groceries and a pack of basswood blocks that she was certain Rio would never touch. Every mile closer, the white dashed lines passing by, Agatha’s irritation faded into relief.</p><p>It was nearly seven and she had packed a bag. Just in case. She didn’t want to presume, but she wasn’t going to miss an opportunity if it was offered because she wasn’t prepared.</p><p>She parked in the driveway and made her way to the door.</p><p>It opened before she’d reached the steps, Rio was standing in the same outfit from her earlier picture. She looked tired and relieved and hopeful, and Agatha felt a sharp pang of regret that she’d missed out on this for so fucking long.</p><p>She slowed as she reached the top step.</p><p>“You look like you should be lying down.”</p><p>Rio pouted, leaning heavily against the door.</p><p>“I don’t want to.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, easing herself through the small gap Rio had left open. She slid her arm around Rio’s back.</p><p>“Too bad.”</p><p>Rio let herself be guided, swinging the door closed as Agatha walked her back to the living room.</p><p>There was a bottle of painkillers, a laptop, a half-finished glass of water, and about a dozen random snacks scattered on the table and couch.</p><p>Agatha frowned. She looked at Rio.</p><p>“Is this all you’ve eaten?”</p><p>Rio pointedly avoided her gaze.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and guided Rio to the couch.</p><p>“Sit down.”</p><p>She left no room for argument, and Rio listened even though she looked like she didn’t want to.</p><p>Agatha set the bags on the table and pulled out one of several blue Gatorades. Rio’s eyes lit up and she took it from Agatha’s outstretched hand.</p><p>Agatha pointed at her.</p><p>“Stay put.”</p><p>Rio tried to lean forward, but her face twisted in pain and she dropped back onto the nest of blankets.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and picked up the package of basswood. Setting it in Rio’s lap, she gave her a look.</p><p>“You don’t know how to whittle.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, scowling back at Agatha disbelievingly.</p><p>“Obviously. That’s why I signed up for a class.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat closed, her eyes filling with tears before she could register the influx of emotion racing through her. She had <i>missed</i> this. She had missed Rio and her ability to absorb knowledge. She knew if Rio signed up for a class, she would, in fact, learn.</p><p>Agatha blinked away tears and leaned down to start gathering the snacks to put them away. She’d collected half of them and turned to the kitchen when Rio’s voice spoke quietly, questioningly.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, chest rising and falling in an effort to control her elevating emotions.</p><p>“I’m okay. Let me just clean up.”</p><p>Cleaning up turned into tidying Rio’s entire kitchen, preheating the oven, and standing in place for five minutes with her heart lodged in her throat.</p><p>The oven beeped and Agatha slid in the lasagna she’d purchased as an easy meal that would at least feed Rio for a few days if she wasn’t here.</p><p>Without any other methods to stall, Agatha returned to the living room and found Rio covered in wood shavings with a familiar knife in one hand and a block of basswood in the other. Her brow was furrowed, eyes deeply focused and leaning toward agitation as the knife cut what was likely too large a chunk.</p><p>Agatha breathed through the clawing ache.</p><p>
<i>Agatha glanced back at a brooding Rio as she attempted to keep her amusement from her face. Nicky was asleep in his stroller and he had been for the better portion of their walk. They’d been on an easy, smooth trail with views of the Potomac. The season was turning, but there were still enough red, orange, and yellow leaves on the trees to make it beautiful.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Before Nicky had conked out, he’d been thrilled every time they’d stopped to let him down and wander around.</i>
</p><p>
<i>One such time, he’d been eager to dig through the fanny pack they kept on the stroller and find a baggie of snacks. He’d also managed to grab Rio’s folded pocket knife. It was locked, the strength-based mechanism keeping him from accidentally triggering it open.</i>
</p><p>
<i>He’d squealed and giggled as he walked toward Rio with the pocket knife held out to her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Both had taken steps to intercept him.</i>
</p><p>
<i>He dropped the knife before Rio could reach him, which would have been fine if they hadn’t been standing on a bridge over the river.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The knife had bounced and skittered right across the peeling wood and through the slats into the rushing water below.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had stared after it as Nicky started bawling his eyes out.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had swooped in to press Nicky to her chest and Rio had put on her bravest face as she stepped into his view.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d tapped his nose with a smile.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s okay, Nic. It’s just a silly thing. No need to worry.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky had sniffled and his chest had shuddered sadly a few more times before he calmed down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d spent the next hour with Agatha rocking Nicky to sleep while Rio waded into the shallows of the Potomac with a hopeless look on her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had placed Nicky gently in his stroller and eventually called Rio back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think it’s gone, love.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had nodded and followed after Agatha as she led them back to their car.</i>
</p><p>
<i>As Agatha buckled Nicky into his carseat, Rio climbed in the passenger side, slumping dejectedly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha gently closed the back door and made her way to Rio, propping the passenger door open and waiting patiently for Rio to look at her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, we’ll get you a new one.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sighed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay. That one was special though.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha linked their hands and squeezed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I know. You bought it after we graduated from Quantico.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha smiled at her, body alight with love and a need to do anything to make her wife smile too.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ll make sure the next one is special too, okay?” She squeezed Rio’s hand. “It’ll commemorate the first of many things Nicky will accidentally destroy.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s lips twitched.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Drawing all over the bathroom didn’t count?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No, remember, that was art.”</i>
</p><p><i>Rio blew out a slow breath, her head nodding as she shook off the melancholy.</i><br/>
____</p><p>Agatha had spent days researching and had eventually spent far too much money on the Benchmade folding knife with a scimitar blade and carbon fiber handle in Rio’s hands. She’d paid a little extra to engrave ‘A+N+R’ into the blade.</p><p>Rio looked up and found Agatha watching. She flushed and tugged uselessly at her shirt, sending the shavings further around her and all over the floor and couch.</p><p>Agatha choked out a laugh and joined her on the couch. She sat down against Rio’s pile of blankets.</p><p>Rio closed the knife and set it on the table along with the malformed block, refocusing on Agatha.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha wiped at the tears in her eyes.</p><p>“I’ve missed you so much, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, tears gathering on her lashes. She swallowed and tried to clear her throat.</p><p>“I’d actually gotten to the point where I believed you’d never say that. That you didn’t feel it.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back and drew her knees up. She felt small, fragile. But she also felt safe knowing that Rio wouldn’t take advantage of that.</p><p>“I’d convinced myself too.” She pulled her eyes away, the connection too intense. “I thought the pain that I felt, the pain that never stopped, was just the loss of Nicky.” Agatha closed her eyes, the waves of memories of feeling so alone and so hopeless rushing through her. “Rio, I ripped out the half of my heart I still had left and didn’t realize why it hurt so badly.”</p><p>Agatha felt a soft hand on her forearm, the light weight of Rio’s fingertips on her skin grounding her.</p><p>She continued, needing to expel the sudden pressure in her chest.</p><p>“I don’t know how I stayed away for so long.”</p><p>She refocused her attention on Rio just in time to catch a sharp flicker of insecurity, of doubt, in Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Rio tried to clear her expression but the wound remained, steady and throbbing.</p><p>“I had–” She sighed. “I expected, at least for the last several years, that you’d moved on. You didn’t respond or reach out… I felt so pathetic. Sitting here, waiting for you, knowing that I would never be able to do the same.” Rio’s hand slipped off Agatha’s arm limply, the words taking their toll as she spoke them. “I thought about you every single day. Some mornings I would wake up and I’d expect to see your hair tangled around your head beside me or hear you downstairs slamming the cabinet doors.”</p><p>Agatha let out a wet laugh, the words eviscerating her.</p><p>“I wasn’t that loud.”</p><p>Rio’s pained face lilted toward amusement.</p><p>“You were never delicate.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, the words carrying far too many meanings.</p><p>“No. I… I wasn’t strong enough to be delicate.”</p><p>Rio caught the direction of her thoughts, her head shaking lightly.</p><p>“You were for Nicky. For me.”</p><p>Agatha offered a rueful smile.</p><p>“Nothing left for the cabinets.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, her eyes softening as she tried to make herself more comfortable in her nest. She tweaked her ribs and huffed pitifully, her lips turning down.</p><p>Agatha wondered how many times her heart would need to break over their missed time, over Rio dealing with all of this alone, before it hurt a little less. She helped adjust the pillows and blankets until Rio’s frown faded.</p><p>Agatha turned toward her, knees still pressed into her chest.</p><p>“I never moved on, Rio. I never even considered it. I spent every moment alone, with a genuine belief that I’d die that way.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched and she looked prepared to say something. Instead, a single word slipped out.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes filled with fresh tears.</p><p>“I just–” Her voice broke, frustration lacing it. “I don’t understand how that was better than coming home.” Rio drew in a sharp breath. “I don’t know why I wasn’t enough to make you fight for me. For us.” She looked overwhelmed, her shoulders drawing up toward her ears. “I would have done <i>anything</i>, Agatha. I would have–”</p><p>She broke off, her voice failing her as she tried not to sob.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure she was breathing. She lifted her hands to hold Rio’s face, her thumbs wiping at the tears even as her own painted her cheeks.</p><p>“Rio.” Her voice was imploring, reverent. “Darling, it was <i>never</i> better. It was never about you not being enough for me.” Agatha tried to put together words that would make Rio understand. “I was just empty. I couldn’t see you, couldn’t touch you, couldn’t bear to let in your memory for the fear of what it would do to me.” She said her next words with so much sincerity that they resounded loudly in her skull. “You have <i>always</i> been enough. For me, for Nicky, for everyone that relies on you. You’ve never given a half measure of your effort.”</p><p>She could see Rio trying to grasp the words, her perfect, strange mind piecing through the claim.</p><p>Rio sniffed.</p><p>“But–”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No. Rio, you saved me. You have to understand.” She let out a wet laugh. “I know that I fought you every fucking step. I dug in my heels and bit and scratched and bled to try and stay in that shitty fucking apartment. In the job that I hated. But if you hadn’t dragged me back here I never would have found my way.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes met hers, searching and hopeful. Then they fell.</p><p>“I should have come sooner.”</p><p>Agatha was entirely certain that that wouldn’t have worked.</p><p>“Rio, my love, you would have destroyed yourself trying. I wasn’t–” Agatha let her hands lower to curl around one of Rio’s. “You had to put your pieces back together before you could look at mine.”</p><p>Rio looked at their intertwined hands, her jaw trembling.</p><p>“It was so hard, Agatha. The last five years felt infinite. There was so much emptiness.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed soothing patterns on Rio’s skin. She offered a soft smile.</p><p>“I know.” She drew in a steadying breath. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Rio said it like it was so easy. To give Agatha everything she wanted without a thought for herself.</p><p>“Wanda said something to me last night…” She lowered her head to find Rio’s eyes. “She said that you wouldn’t regret anything. That even-” Her voice faltered. “That despite everything, you wouldn’t have regretted meeting me. Is that true?”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t given a moment to worry over the answer.</p><p>“I’d live our life a thousand times. Even if it ended the same way. Even if you never came back to me.”</p><p>A fresh wave of tears torrented down Agatha’s cheeks and she let the words encompass her, settling soft and warm over every brittle part of her. She squeezed Rio’s hands hoping that her words were clear enough.</p><p>“Do you know that it’s the same for me?”</p><p>Rio looked startled, her eyes widening. Like she didn’t know that she was <i>everything</i>.</p><p>“It is?”</p><p>Her voice was so fragile.</p><p>Agatha laughed desperately.</p><p>“Rio, my only regret is the amount of time I let pass before telling you.” She huffed. “And that I have enabled your ridiculous request to whittle.”</p><p>Rio folded into her, her face pressing into Agatha’s throat, her hands clinging to Agatha’s shirt. She made a pained sound but didn’t withdraw, her breath warm on Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Agatha adjusted them into a better position for Rio’s ribs and held her as tightly as she could without causing her discomfort. She tangled her fingers in Rio’s hair and continued speaking, her voice gentle.</p><p>“All that I want, all that I need now, is you. Whatever that looks like, whatever pace you need to set, I’m here. I’m not fucking going anywhere unless you tell me to.”</p><p>The statement settled between them and Agatha felt serene. Her tears dried, her limbs felt warm and pliant, and the tangle in her chest that had choked her for years and years loosened. She let Rio feel it, let her cry, and thought about the future for the first time since Nicky’s diagnosis.<br/>
____</p><p>Agatha chuckled as Rio pouted at the stairs.</p><p>It was far too late for either of them to be awake. Agatha had work and Rio needed rest to recover. But they’d stayed folded together until the lasagna was finished. Agatha’s trip to withdraw, plate, and store the remaining food had been the only time Rio’s hands weren’t on her.</p><p>Since then, they’d been intertwined, a giddiness that came from relief– from release– surging through them as they’d eaten on the couch amongst irritating shavings of Rio’s woodblock. Rio hadn’t stopped looking at her, something Agatha would have pointed out if she’d been any different.</p><p>Now, she wrapped an arm around Rio’s back.</p><p>“You can do this, Director.”</p><p>Rio’s pout turned into a pathetic glare.</p><p>“I know that.” She didn’t move, her brow furrowing. “We could sleep on the couch.”</p><p>Agatha smirked.</p><p>“You’re supposed to keep yourself moving. It’ll be good for you.”</p><p>Rio took her first slow step.</p><p>“I didn’t realize you’d gone to medical school.”</p><p>Agatha moved with her.</p><p>“You can call me doctor if it moves you up these stairs faster.”</p><p>Rio groaned.</p><p>“Don’t. I can’t think about Doctor Agatha right now.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, steadying Rio’s next step as she tilted slightly.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Rio frowned, her arms crossing petulantly over her chest.</p><p>“I’ll stand on these steps all night if you keep laughing at me.”</p><p>Agatha bit back her smile for approximately half a second before she lifted her brows.</p><p>“I forgot how bratty you got when you were injured. What would people think?”</p><p>Rio’s expression went through a tumultuous roll of emotions before it sank into a look of warning.</p><p>“I’m going to remember this. I might not be able to deal with you now, but when I can move properly?” Her pout had vanished, her eyes were sharply observing Agatha’s face. “You’ll pay for every fucking word.”</p><p>Agatha felt the burn begin low in her belly, her heartbeat kicking up. She could not fucking wait for Rio to move properly. She offered her a dismissive shrug.</p><p>“Whatever you say, sweetheart.”</p><p>She moved to replace her guiding hand.</p><p>Rio caught her wrist, the grip firm, unyielding. Her voice was an octave lower, her eyes were all challenge.</p><p>“You look a little flushed, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha felt a whine crawl up her throat and she cut it off just before it could betray her.</p><p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>Rio dropped her wrist.</p><p>“You will.”<br/>
___</p><p>Rio had brushed her teeth in silence, her posture tight, her jaw rolling.</p><p>Agatha knew if she pressed her fingers under the band of Rio’s boxers she’d find her soaked. She also knew, body permitting, Rio would already have her bent over the counter of the sink.</p><p>It felt a little bit like whiplash, going from tears to laughter to wanting to get railed in the span of a few hours. She hadn’t forgotten how to push Rio’s buttons, but she also hadn’t expected it to snap Rio out of her pity-party quite so sharply.</p><p>Even Rio seemed a little disoriented by the abrupt change, her brow furrowed as she put her toothbrush away. Agatha leaned her hip on the counter and circled her fingers around Rio’s wrist.</p><p>“Hey tough guy.” She waited for Rio to look at her. “Soon, okay?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes searched, then softened.</p><p>“Right. Okay.” She blushed. “Sorry, that kind of caught me off guard.”</p><p>Agatha shifted, her core aching.</p><p>“Tell me about it. You– fuck Rio, I really missed you.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her eyes sleepy but bright with joy.</p><p>“You don’t have to anymore, you know? I think that’s what we’ve settled on.”</p><p>It was a cheeky response and Agatha thought her lungs might burst with how full she felt.</p><p>“Come on, sleep. I have to wake up at five and I know you’re going to throw a fit.”</p><p>Rio’s feigned offense.</p><p>“Maybe try being quiet and I won’t have anything to complain about.”</p><p>Agatha grinned as she walked with Rio to the room. She helped her under the covers and walked around the side that had once belonged to her. She felt every step, her feet tracing the patterns that had ingrained in her: the soles of her feet sinking into the warm rug, five paces across as she rounded the foot of the bed, the brief sink of cool hardwood as she reached the edge.</p><p>She crawled into bed beside Rio and pulled the covers up her body, her nose catching the achingly familiar scent, her body sinking into what was likely a newer mattress than the one they’d shared. She turned, hair already tangling around her head, and tucked her knees up as she faced Rio.</p><p>Rio was already watching.</p><p>“It would be crazy to ask you to do this every night, right?”</p><p>Agatha felt the instantaneous response leap to her mind. <i>Not crazy at all. Please ask me.</i> But there was so much to heal, so much to work on still. She grinned softly.</p><p>“I think we’ll get there, Rio. But this is your space right now. I’m not going to take that away from you. As we figure this out, you deserve to have a place to unwind.”</p><p>Rio sighed, her lips turning down.</p><p>“I’m unwound already.” She nudged the back of Agatha’s hand. “I know you’re right, but I want you here. When you can be here, I mean.”</p><p>Agatha linked their fingers.</p><p>“I will be.”<br/>
_____</p><p>The next week was hectic, their team investigating a sudden influx of wire transfers hitting small banks around the DC area and spreading into parts of the midwest. It took up a significant portion of their time. They worked through a Sunday night and found the case-breaking lead within the early hours of the morning. It had been a small tech team at a megacorporation that had tried to develop AI to mimic banking behavior and carry out wire fraud.</p><p>Wanda sent the team home with two days of mandatory time off and Agatha felt as if she were sleepwalking into the guest house.</p><p>She wanted nothing more than to sleep, but she let Scratchy out of his cage and sat on the floor for thirty minutes. He darted around, his fluffy body a streak of fur as he flung himself through the rooms.</p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed in her pocket and she withdrew to a text from Rio.</p><p>
<i>Rio: Congrats on closing the case, Agatha.</i>
</p><p>They’d been in near-constant contact since their conversation. Agatha had found herself stepping across the threshold of her once-home nearly every evening, only having gone to the guest house a few times to get new clothes and spend time with Scratchy.</p><p>She’d told Wanda she wanted to pay Billy in some way for his continuous help in taking care of Scratchy, but Wanda’s response had been a simple, “He loves your rabbit, Agatha. I don’t want to spoil that.”</p><p>Agatha typed a quick response.</p><p>
<i>I haven’t slept in fifty-four hours. I can feel my eyes in their sockets.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: Gross.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: Home safe?</i>
</p><p>Agatha looked around the guest house. It still felt welcoming, still felt warm, but the sense of it being ‘home’ had begun to fade sometime between Rio’s “I want you here” and Agatha’s fourth night tucked against her side.</p><p>They’d decided a small break would be good. That Agatha would go home for a night and rest. It felt like the worst idea she’d ever had. She left Scratchy to wander around and padded her way up the steps. She frowned at the pile of laundry stacked on the chair in the corner, her clothes pulled from her go-bag and tossed aside. Her bed was made but rumpled and various clean clothes were set on the corners of it from when she’d packed her go-bag.</p><p>She needed to clean. And do laundry.</p><p>
<i>I’m back</i>
</p><p>Home wasn’t the word for it; it felt wrong to type.</p><p>She started pulling the clean clothes from her bed and returning them to the closet. As she knelt to return a pair of shoes to the rack, her eyes fell on the box that had stayed with her, had been a thorn in her chest, for five years. Every year it had felt heavier, had carried more grief, more dread. Now, Agatha stared and felt something entirely different.</p><p>She pulled the box from the floor and walked it to the bed.</p><p>With steady hands, she withdrew the green, leather album and flipped the first page. The flowers had been preserved well. Rio had taught her when Agatha had questioned the significant amount of dried bouquets tied and hanging from the ceiling.</p><p>Agatha expected pain as she looked at the bright colors and deep greens. She found herself, instead, reluctant to look through it alone.</p><p>They hadn’t talked about the letters. Agatha knew that they would need to. There was so much to cover about what happened while they were apart. There were still so many things that had been left unsaid. Agatha wanted to know about Grim, about how Rio had found him, what he was like, if they spoke often. She wanted to know about the relationships Rio had formed in her absence. She wanted to know if Rio had found temporary hands to cradle her perfect heart, if she’d been able to find moments of peace.</p><p>She didn’t feel jealous, not truly. That others had time with Rio when she did not, of course. That others were able to touch when she could not, yes. But she didn’t begrudge Rio her connections. It gave her a sense of hope that Rio might have found temporary fixtures and allowed herself to be taken care of.</p><p>Agatha had never gotten so far as to date anyone.</p><p>She’d drunk herself to the bottom of several tumblers a few times, had fucked women into her hangovers the following day, and had never spoken to them again.</p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed again.</p><p>
<i>Rio: Are you going to sleep?</i>
</p><p>Agatha smiled softly.</p><p>
<i>I should.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: I don’t think the guest house bed is very comfortable.</i>
</p><p>Agatha chuckled. It was incredibly comfortable. Wanda made sure of that.</p><p>
<i>You don’t?</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: No. You probably won’t sleep very well there.</i>
</p><p>Agatha pulled her go-bag onto the bed and tried not to overthink it as she tossed further dirty clothes onto the chair. She stuffed the bag with jeans and two shirts before changing from her suit into joggers and a cropped tee that she was certain didn’t belong to her. She tossed on a light jacket and sat down on the edge of the bed.</p><p>
<i>That would be unfortunate. What’s your solution?</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: There’s a really comfortable bed here.</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s heart buzzed. It was stupid, really. She should sleep here, take some space, and give Rio a moment to breathe.</p><p>But the need to be with her was nearly a compulsion; like they were making up for the lost moments.</p><p>
<i>I don’t know. I heard there’s an adult-sized, whiny baby that lives there. Do you think she’ll be there today?</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: I just got word that she’s gone for the evening.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It’s morning.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio: And? You’ll be sleeping through that anyway.</i>
</p><p>Agatha laughed and stood, her decision made from the first text. She gently placed the leather-bound album in her go-bag, set the letters on top, and zipped it closed.<br/>
______</p><p>Wanda was pulling into the driveway as Agatha walked toward her car, the chilly air tempered by the blazing sun overhead. She waited for Wanda to pop her door open and step out, already preparing for the mockery.</p><p>Wanda looked exhausted. She had dark circles under her eyes and her hair was pulled back in a loose bun. But when she took in Agatha, her lips curled into a cheshire smile.</p><p>“Oh, should I pretend to be surprised or just tell you to have fun?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“I had every intention of sleeping here.”</p><p>Wanda nodded serenely, coming to a stop in front of Agatha.</p><p>“I’m sure it took hours of convincing for Rio to get your bag repacked.”</p><p>Agatha pulled open the driver’s door and set the bag in the passenger seat.</p><p>“Days even.”</p><p>Wanda snorted.</p><p>“I definitely believe you.” She walked forward and pulled Agatha into a hug. “Good for you. You can take space when you live there again.”</p><p>Agatha tried to deflect the surge of emotion from her statement. It was too soon to be considering that. And if she considered it enough, she’d want it too much. They needed more time.</p><p>Wanda stepped back and blew her a playful kiss.</p><p>“Have fun. Try not to fuck her into more broken ribs.”</p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p>“Jesus, Wanda, you have children about.”</p><p>Wanda looked over her shoulder as she walked toward the house.</p><p>“Nope. Vis took them to the zoo.” She winked. “I, for one, like my alone-time.” The following words were softer. “Enjoy yourself, Agatha.”<br/>
_____</p><p>Agatha set her bag on the floor by the bed, her eyes already drooping at the thought of curling up and passing out.</p><p>Rio was moving around better, her pain lessened after a week and a half of recovery. She had followed Agatha up the steps without aid and was now pulling the blinds closed so the morning sun wouldn’t blaze into Agatha’s eyes while she tried to sleep.</p><p>Agatha expected she could sleep through a house burning down if it started after she closed her eyes.</p><p>She slipped under the covers and felt the cool silk of the sheets on her skin.</p><p>Rio settled on the edge of the bed and pursed her lips.</p><p>“I probably shouldn’t have tried to get you to come here. But I’m glad you did.”</p><p>Agatha was barely functioning, her eyes falling closed as she shook her head softly.</p><p>“If you didn’t, I probably would have sleep-walked my way here. You actually saved my life.”</p><p>Rio grinned, her hand settling warm on Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“I’m glad to have been of service. Get some sleep.”</p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed through the thick comforter and it was enough to send a tingle through Agatha’s entire body. Her last conscious thoughts were a string of ideas that pieced themselves together, images of ways that she might be able to get Rio naked before the approved recovery time.<br/>
_____</p><p>Agatha woke to the blare of the smoke alarm.</p><p>She let out a pained moan and somehow heard the exclamation of curses over the shrill sound. Agatha felt delirious, her eyes crusted and her body weak with sleep. She didn’t know what time it was, only that the sun was still up and she was still exhausted.</p><p>She heard a clatter and waited for the sound to stop.</p><p>It did not.</p><p>With a pathetic whine, Agatha threw the covers to the side and moved swiftly into the hallway and down the steps. She rounded into the kitchen to find Rio surrounded by a growing cloud of smoke with a make-shift stair created from a step-stool, a chair, and the table. Rio was swearing repeatedly as she balanced on a table with the broom in her hands, trying to jab the end of it into the smoke-alarm.</p><p>Agatha felt a surge of adrenaline, her sleepiness fading as she quickly crossed the distance to keep Rio from falling as she wobbled.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio looked pale, her arms shaking from the effort, and Agatha pulled the broom from her hand. She pointed to the middle, sturdier section of the table.</p><p>“Stand there, don’t move.”</p><p>Rio obliged, her cheeks reddening sharply as Agatha pulled the chair to the proper place and climbed up. She pushed the button and the room was filled with a sudden silence.</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded behind her breastbone and she turned to stare at Rio where she was absurdly haloed by the kitchen light. It was ridiculous. So ridiculous that she felt the bubble of laughter spill from her before she could chastise or, god forbid, help Rio to the ground.</p><p>She curled over slightly, hands resting on her knees as Rio groaned.</p><p>Agatha tried to breathe through it, her eyes watering as she stood and walked to the side of the table.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Come here.”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, looking petulant, and Agatha had to stop as she fell into another fit of laughter.</p><p>If Rio could stamp her foot safely, she would have.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha giggled, her lungs heaving as she pulled herself together. She noticed Rio’s phone on the counter and walked to that instead, turning the camera on Rio and snapping a photo. She attempted to send it to herself, shocked that Rio’s passcode hadn’t changed in five years.</p><p>With the whoosh of the message, Agatha refocused on her task.</p><p>Rio looked like she might fling herself from the table in embarrassment and Agatha loved her. She loved her more than anything. She wanted her more than anything.</p><p>With great effort, she subdued her laughter and walked to the makeshift stair.</p><p>“Down the way you went up?”</p><p>Rio walked carefully to the edge, her eyes on the chair below with a grimace. She looked like she was in some actual discomfort and it was enough to sober Agatha further.</p><p>Agatha took one of her hands and placed a hand on her hip.</p><p>Their first attempt was a failure, Rio hissing as she lost her balance and jolted, her teeth pressing together.</p><p>Rio dropped her head back.</p><p>“I’m staying up here forever.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, pulling the stool closer and standing on it.</p><p>“Come here, darling.”</p><p>Rio looked at her suspiciously but did as she was told.</p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s hips and lifted her slowly, setting her on the chair. She stepped from the stool and did the same thing, placing Rio on the stool. This time, she didn’t let go, her arms sliding back so that her hands were pressed into Rio’s hips. She looked up and smiled at Rio’s disgruntled expression.</p><p>“Silly girl.”</p><p>Rio blushed, her eyes rolling as she tried to push Agatha away.</p><p>“I can get on the ground myself.”</p><p>Agatha hummed softly, her eyes searching Rio’s.</p><p>“Sure, but then I have no excuse to touch you.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her gaze returning.</p><p>“You don’t need an excuse.”</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>“Humor me?”</p><p>Rio feigned annoyance but Agatha could see the way her eyes had gone soft.</p><p>With movements far slower than they needed to be, Agatha lifted Rio and set her gently on the hardwoods. She tilted her head, her lips pulling up.</p><p>“Were you making dinner?”</p><p>Rio frowned.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted.</p><p>“No? Just lighting things on fire then?”</p><p>Rio groaned and looked away.</p><p>“Agathaaaa.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, her heart so full. She leaned forward and kissed Rio’s cheek. It was innocent enough, a soft press of lips on skin, but she heard Rio’s intake of breath and saw the slight jump in her chest.</p><p>Rio’s hands reached out and curled into Agatha’s shirt. She met her gaze and, this close, Agatha could see the way Rio’s brown eyes, touches of hazel, searched her.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach fluttered, the buzz of anticipation so similar to the first time they’d played pool in that shitty dive. Then it had been an understanding that there was something there. A connection, a pull that felt intoxicating. There had been a spark of excitement for what would come.</p><p>Now? Agatha could think of nothing but the impossible chance she was being given; an opportunity to create another future with the woman that had been so fucking gentle with her heart. It was different than they’d planned in their youth. She knew both of them expected their hardest years to be behind them.</p><p>But they had so much life left. To pursue it without Nicky, to move forward and live and find joy without him had once seemed unthinkable.</p><p>Agatha felt the tears coming and leaned in the last centimeters to press their lips together.</p><p>Rio breathed against her, parted her lips, and captured Agatha’s bottom one, her hands pulling tighter.</p><p>It was slow and filled with so much that Agatha let out a shaky breath of her own. She was careful with her hands as she cradled Rio’s jaw and deepened the kiss. They’d always fit one another so well and nothing had changed despite their time apart.</p><p>Agatha kissed Rio until she couldn’t breathe and still she didn’t pull away. Warmth blossomed in every limb of her body and pooled low in her stomach. She felt dizzy with want and lack of oxygen, her tongue sliding gently against Rio’s, teasing, and Rio whined softly.</p><p>Agatha was certain her eyes would have rolled back at the sound had they been open. She loved when Rio became pliant, when her desire to be touched and picked apart overwrote her need to be in control.</p><p>It hadn’t happened often, which suited Agatha’s preference to be wrecked entirely, but the moments that she was handed the reins?</p><p>Agatha felt the blaze of heat between her thighs.<br/>
_____</p><p>
<i>”Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s voice was warning, her eyes dark and lidded from where they were sat beside one another in an upscale bar Bohner had selected for their trivia night. They were over a year into being agents and most of them had little free time. They didn’t often choose to spend it with each other getting wasted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But tonight, Bohner had sent out a text and a surprising amount of responses had been positive. Rio had been adamant that they had other things to do. Agatha had agreed anyway.<br/>
____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha, Rio, and Wanda had had a rare day off at the same time. Vision had called in sick with very aggressive prompting and several threats from Agatha. They’d loaded into Wanda’s SUV at seven in the morning at Rio’s prompting and made a two hour drive to Lake Anna.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was excited for a day at the beach. She’d been far less excited to be crawling out of bed before the sun on her day off. She’d made sure Rio knew that. Had complained endlessly as they packed Rio’s cooler, folding chairs, and pre-packed beach supplies.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d been deeply grumpy and Rio hadn’t cared one fucking bit.</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time they were on the road out of the city, Agatha had changed tactics.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They were sitting in the back, the windows down slightly for the perfect, cool, summer breeze. Music played softly, the sleepiness still heavy in the car, and Agatha slid into the middle seat and rebuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She set her hand on Rio’s thigh absently and continued to watch the city pass by. An hour in, Wanda turned the music up, the genre switching to hits from the 2000’s, and conversation picked up with the excitement of spending the day on the water.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed as Vision explained the misunderstanding that had occurred at his work. It wasn’t necessarily a funny story, but Agatha was only half-listening. Her fingers had started working patterns into Rio’s thigh, sliding higher every few minutes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She slid up again, digging her nails into Rio’s inner thigh, and felt Rio tense beside her. A hand settled on her wrist tightly in warning and Agatha smiled. She said something in response to Wanda’s next comment and started over, her hand back on Rio’s knee.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They stopped at the store to pick up snacks, alcohol, and two bags of ice that were dumped into the cooler. The stop lasted a total of thirty minutes and Agatha spent the entire time working Rio up.<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>In the snack aisle:</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I think I’ll wear my hair up. I don’t want it getting tangled because of the wind.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had stared at Rio as she pulled her hair back, her smile innocent, her eyes anything but. She’d placed her hand on Rio’s hip and knelt down beside her to grab a bag of chips she didn’t want.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It wasn’t indecent, but the implication was there as she stroked her thumb over Rio’s hipbone.<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>At the liquor store:</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Are you hot? It’s so warm in here.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had unbuttoned her loose, linen button-up. She was technically wearing a one piece. As in, it was entirely attached through a few thin black straps that crossed over her stomach and sides. But the effect remained the same, her tits in full view through the split in her shirt.<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>As they were loading the cooler:</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, you dropped some.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha bent over, ass on display through her flowy shorts, the straps of the swimsuit riding high on her hips as her shirt slid to reveal the skin on her back and sides.<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was mild really, silly, but Agatha could see that Rio knew she was doing it on purpose. Her eyes had been sharp on her for the past two hours and she was shifting in her seat as they arrived at the parking lot to the dock.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha patted Rio’s knee.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You okay, love?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s eyes had blazed into hers but she had no time to reply as Vision popped his door open and let out a pleased sigh.<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>The entire day had been a work of art on Agatha’s part: perfect timing mixed with Rio’s helpless attraction to her and an inability to do <i>anything</i> about it had made her Agatha’s plaything for once.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They found their rented boat, tossed a massive, inflatable tube inside, and went through the spiel with the worker on the docks.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had no part in the safety conversation. She climbed into the boat as the three adults listened with rapt attention, her linen shirt falling from her shoulders as she set the measly grocery bag she’d been willing to carry on the seat. She withdrew her sunscreen and shimmied out of her shorts, sitting delicately on the warm leather seat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She didn’t have to look to know she had Rio’s eyes on her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She moved with slow, sensual strokes, rubbing the sunscreen into her skin until it gleamed bright in the sunlight. She started on her lower back and felt the shift of the boat as somebody stepped on.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio appeared in front of her, shirking her responsibility to safety, the spiel still continuing on the deck.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt a shiver despite the heat on her skin. She loved Rio like this. She loved driving her mad because the payout was always fucking delicious.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha gave Rio her most innocent expression.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes, love?” She frowned, looking toward the worker who was trying desperately to keep his eyes on Wanda and Vision. They flicked to her several times anyway. “Oh, don’t you need to hear that? What if we get caught on a sandbar? What if the boat stalls? I hear reversing can be kind of difficult.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio held her hand out and didn’t say anything.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shrugged and passed the sunscreen to her. She turned her body to give Rio access and felt the dip on the cushion and Rio’s hands settled on her waist.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shifted her further, hands less than gentle, and spoke quietly as she poured the sunscreen into her palm.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re not subtle.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her tone was rough, vibrating with energy that Agatha wanted access to.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha kept her voice light.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What? I’m just excited to get out on the water.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio didn’t warm the lotion before pressing both hands against the heated skin of her back. She jumped slightly, her eyes narrowing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you’re going to be so harsh I can do it myself.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s voice was clipped.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha grinned openly, her face toward the water so that Rio couldn’t see it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She relaxed into the press of Rio’s palms on her back, the slide of her fingers along her spine and under the thin straps of black fabric. Rio had her hands on her, smoothing the sunscreen along her skin, for far longer than she needed to. She only stopped when Vision stepped into the boat and clapped his hands.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Alright my daring counterparts. Who will be captaining this vessel, first?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha placed a hand on Rio’s shoulder.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s all she’s been talking about. I’m sure Rio is happy to.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt a thrill as the hand still on her back pressed, Rio’s nails indenting her skin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vision held out a hand toward the driver’s seat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Casting off!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stood, her perch beside Agatha filled by Wanda soon after.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda spoke quietly, amusement clear in her voice.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re fucking in for it, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha leaned against the cushion and slipped her sunglasses over her eyes. She dropped her head back to take in the heat of the sun. She rested her elbows against the side of the boat and grinned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I hope so.”<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha waited a proper amount of time before nudging Wanda.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m going to take in the views from the front.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda laughed and shook her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Good luck, babe.” Wanda called to Vision where he stood beside Rio. “Vis, honey, come sit with me!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha slid by Vision, then Rio, and let her fingers trail over Rio’s neck as she passed. She settled herself down on one of the cushioned benches in the front. The one directly in Rio’s eyeline.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She laid out, her arms stretched over her head, her back arching slightly, her knees leaning against the side of the seat so that Rio had an unimpeded view.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It didn’t take long before her showboating paid off.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had been maneuvering the boat with skill, her movements smooth and practiced, careful. A few minutes in, Agatha felt a small twitch, a sharper turn than the others, and let her smile spread wide as she basked.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She got in a solid thirty minutes of tanning, the waves subtle and soothing, before the boat began to slow. Agatha peeked her eyes open and found Rio watching her as the boat slowed to a stop. Her jaw was wire-tight as she slowly stood from the seat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She called out to Vision but didn’t look back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Want to take over, Vis? Agatha wants me to go with her on the tube. She said she wanted to cool off.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes widened.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh no, no. That’s–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha sat up as Vision made his way forward with a smile. His pale, sandy hair hung over his forehead and he was standing in a pair of maroon swim trunks. He was covered in a thick layer of sunscreen, streaks of it on his skin. He motioned to himself.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You can’t be too careful.” He traded places with Rio, and dropped his sunglasses over his eyes. “Right then, prepare yourselves for a joyous adventure!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stepped out, her loose shirt fluttering in the light breeze. Her voice was sugar sweet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Come on, Agatha. It’ll be fun.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha heard the challenge, knew she couldn’t get out of this easily without losing the upper-hand she’d obtained. She rolled her eyes behind her sunglasses and followed Rio to the back of the boat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda had a shit-eating grin on her face as she shifted to the side, making room for them to step over the seats where the large tube was tied down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stood by, arms crossed, while Rio went about hooking the rope to the boat and tossing the tube in the water. After, she opened a hatch and retrieved two lifejackets, tossing one to Agatha without warning.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha caught the jacket and grimaced at the musky lake smell that wafted from it. She slipped the worryingly damp material on and buckled it in place.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stripped off her shirt, revealing a deep green bikini top and toned arms and shoulders that flexed as she slid her lifejacket on.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt the drop of molten heat in her gut, the saliva pooling in her mouth as she pulled her gaze away. She was not losing. Not today.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stripped off her shorts and stepped down by the ladder to get the tube in position. She grinned at Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Ladies first.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha climbed over the seats and stared at the green-blue water lapping against the side of the boat. She huffed and waited for Rio to get the tube steady before reaching out a foot.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Fortunately for her, she wasn’t an imbecile. She saw the twitch of Rio’s hand as she moved to step out and grabbed onto Rio’s lifejacket with lightning speed, yanking with her full force. Agatha caught the ladder to save herself as Rio was flung onto the tube before rolling into the cool water.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt adrenaline burst through her, a heady, dangerous anticipation flooding her body as Rio spluttered to the surface. Agatha called over to her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Nice try, darling.” Agatha got another waft of the mildew from her vest and shrugged. “I think I’ll sit this one out. I’m having a good hair day.” Agatha stripped off her jacket as Rio watched and stuffed it back in the hatch. “Have so much fun! Try not to fall off too early. I’ll be disappointed.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha turned, keeping her eyes from Rio’s with all of her effort. She settled in the seats at the back of the boat to have an uninterrupted view of Rio pulling herself onto the tube, her arms, now covered in droplets of water, rippling in the most appealing way.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio settled herself, hair soaked, and looked up at Agatha from the water. She opened her mouth to speak and Agatha twisted her finger in the air.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Gun it, Vis!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>He called over the sounds of the water.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“At your service!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha heard the motor churn over whatever Rio said and she waved pleasantly as the boat began to drift further away, pulling the rope out until it was taut.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vision let the tube drag for a few moments before picking up speed, keeping Rio in the wake as he began to snake the boat across the cool water.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had both hands locked on the handles, her forearms flexing as water began to spray up around her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha watched Rio lean and shift and regroup for several long minutes, staying perfectly situated in the middle of the tube.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vision only put her out of the wake once.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha leaned back to look at Wanda and Wanda was already standing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ve got it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The changeover was quick, the boat only slowly slightly as Vision and Wanda traded places.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha squealed as Wanda absolutely fucking gunned it, the boat jerking forward and almost launching Agatha into the water. She watched as Rio caught on just in time, locking her hands tightly on the handles and bracing as the rope snapped taut.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The next several minutes were a fucking reckoning.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vision yelped as he tried to get himself situated, having fallen when Wanda hit the throttle. Agatha was holding on for dear life as the boat carved and cut through the water, finding its own wake to drag Rio through.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was truly impressive how long Rio was able to hang on, her eyes nearly closed to the spray, her body jerking side to side, getting airtime as the tube bounced out of the water.</i>
</p><p>
<i>On a rather brutal pass, Rio was launched sideways over the wake, lifted in the air, and slammed into the water with enough force to dislodge one of her hands. Just in time for Wanda to cut in the opposite direction and nearly topple the tube, the edge of it lifting high before Rio could get her grip back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She was flung sideways into the water and skidded a few feet before sinking under.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha cheered, signaling Wanda, and Wanda slowed the engine immediately.</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time they made their way back around, coming up next to Rio where she looked exhausted and deeply pleased with herself.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her arms were shaking slightly as she pulled herself back onto the boat, her lungs heaving, her face bright with excitement.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fuck you, Wanda.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda laughed lightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I was told to make it happen.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mouth dropped open and she glared at her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I said no such thing.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Wanda winked.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It was implied.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha should have been paying attention. Agatha should have known that her actions would not go unpunished.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She felt cold hands on her arm and back as Rio, shaking, tired Rio, lugged her to her feet and dragged both of them back into the water.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha barely let out a scream before her blissfully hot skin sank into the cold, the shock of it taking her breath away for a few moments.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She felt Rio’s arms around her waist, holding her above the waterline, and sputtered as she wiped droplets from her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s breath ghosted over her skin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Were you satisfied, love?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha met her eyes, feeling her desire to win wane at Rio’s smug look. It only took seconds to remember that that was the same look she’d worn as she’d dragged Agatha out of bed that morning.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shrugged, her body adjusting to the temperature.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Moderately.”<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>The rest of the day had been filled with alcohol and mindless snacking. Agatha, Wanda, and Rio sitting in the front so they could still talk with Vision as he ferried them around the lake.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Near one in the afternoon, they began the journey back to the docks to depart and make their way to the beach.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had never stopped her game.</i>
</p><p>
<i>A sly touch, a double entendre, a seemingly innocent movement that drew Rio’s attention her way.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d never gotten away with it for so long, never had the opportunity to drive Rio absolutely fucking mad with inaction. The power trip was… something. It had her bold. Kept her ratcheting up the taunts and the toying and the prodding until she could see that Rio was struggling to maintain her composure.</i>
</p><p>
<i>So, when they received the text from Bohner, an absurdly large group chat about a trivia night that started at seven, Agatha had seen an opportunity to continue the torment.</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio and I can make it.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>The look she’d received from Rio, promising a punishment of epic proportions, had crawled up her spine and settled heady and hot in her chest. It burned there for the remainder of their time sprawled on the beach.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It burned through their dip into the water, her hands sliding against Rio’s ribs under the gentle waves.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It burned through a friendly game of volleyball they’d joined when a group of college kids had asked them if they’d wanted to tag in.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It burned through packing up and loading their things into the car.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt as if she had been torched from the inside, her lungs aching with every intake of breath.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She wasn’t sure what Rio had planned, her mind likely churning with schemes to make Agatha pay for every single second Rio had been forced to remain idle. She didn’t intend on facing those consequences just yet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha cleared her throat as they closed the trunk.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Vis, do you mind if I ride in the front? I’m feeling like I might get carsick.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had never been carsick in her life.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio knew that. Wanda knew that.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Vision did not. And he was happy to oblige as always.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She received a text as she climbed into the passenger seat and found Wanda’s name on the screen.</i>
</p><p>Wanda: You’re soo so so so fucked.</p><p>
<i>Agatha tried to hide her grin,</i>
</p><p>I know.</p><p>
<i>She paused, then texted Wanda again.</i>
</p><p>Can you suggest we rinse off at your place? We have a change of clothes with us.</p><p>Wanda: Don’t involve me in your sexcapades!</p><p>Do it or I’ll tell Vision that when you first started dating him you called him too soft and almost broke up with him.</p><p>
<i>Wanda shot her a glare and started the car before replying.</i>
</p><p>Wanda: You wouldn’t. That would break his heart.</p><p>
<i>Agatha pursed her lips.</i>
</p><p>Okay, I wouldn’t. Do this for me anyway?</p><p>
<i>Twenty minutes into the drive, Wanda suggested they just stop by her place as it was on the way.<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time the four of them had arrived at the bar, Agatha felt like she was already drunk. She hadn’t tempted her fate twice, choosing to slide in beside Rio in the backseat for the quick trip. Rio had watched her with a heavy gaze, her eyes roving over Agatha like she was taking mental notes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She had a steady flush to her cheeks, a tell that had been present for a significant portion of the day. Her hand interlaced with Agatha’s before any further attempts at torment could be made and she spoke under her breath.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You feel good, Agatha?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s breath caught and she forced her voice to remain neutral.</i>
</p><p><i>“It’s been a wonderful day.” She squeezed Rio’s hand. “And you? Do you feel </i>good?<i>”</i></p><p>
<i>Rio’s nails dug into the tender flesh of Agatha’s hand and Agatha’s entire body flushed, her heart jump-starting in her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’ve been playing your game for–” Rio made a show of looking at her watch. “Eight hours. Are you getting tired of pretending you’re not drenched at the thought of what I’m going to do to you?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nearly gasped, nearly gave herself away with the smallest of taunts from Rio. She was better than that.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh? I’m sorry, Rio, I didn’t even realize I was playing.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s jaw flexed, her eyes flashing in warning, and Agatha was certain she’d never been more turned on in her life. She spoke softly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We’re staying for one hour.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha couldn’t agree more. She pouted anyway.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“But we haven’t seen anyone in ages! There’s so much to catch up on.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha.” Rio lifted Agatha’s hand and pressed her lips against the small indents from her nails. “If you do not leave when I suggest we leave, you’ll be lucky if I touch you at all for the rest of this week.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Like you could help yourself.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s lips, pressed flat for the duration of this conversation, lifted into a smug, deeply confident smirk. She leaned her mouth close to Agatha’s ear.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You know how much I enjoy watching you beg. It’ll be worth it to see that desperation on your face, knowing how much you need me, how much you want me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha breathed through blazing coals in her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“And if I leave when you suggest it?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was a question she wished she could take back. She knew the answer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio hummed, her hand releasing Agatha’s and falling to her thigh. She spread her palm wide and pulled Agatha’s thigh toward her, spreading her legs in a way that felt indecent even in her tailored pants.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It won’t be a suggestion.” Rio squeezed her thigh. “If you leave when I tell you to, I’ll consider letting you come tonight.”<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had been prepared to give in. She’d make Rio work for it, obviously, keep her on her toes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Their attending cohort split into three teams and Agatha, Wanda, Vision, and Rio, with the addition of three other players, had gotten first place.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wasn’t even annoyed that Vision had been the one to nail down every single answer. Wanda hadn’t been either, if the way she was watching him hungrily as he happily sat in his seat was anything to go by.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had been too busy watching.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio would have been quick to answer a dozen of the answers normally, her and Vision going toe to toe, but she was nearly silent.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her expression held mild interest and the beer in her hands was empty within a few minutes. Her knee was bouncing steadily beneath the table and her jaw hadn’t stopped clenching from the moment they’d sat down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha couldn’t keep her eyes from Rio for long.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She placed a hand on Rio’s back and watched her shoulders drop slightly, her head tilting down as she closed her eyes for a moment.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The powerful feeling from earlier that day, the taste of control, had Agatha nearly moaning at the table. She rubbed soothing patterns into Rio’s shoulders and down to her lower back and Rio looked like she was going to melt into the table.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha couldn’t breathe.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She stood, pressing against Rio’s side.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you want another drink, darling?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tensed and straightened, her expression molding into something hard. And Agatha… for the first time, did not believe it. Glee coiled in her gut as she lifted a brow for Rio’s answer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Same thing.” She caught Agatha as she turned to walk away. “Last drink, Agatha. We’re leaving at half.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha smiled in acquiescence and moved to the bar, ordering a beer for herself and an Old Fashioned for Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She placed it on the table and watched as Rio took in the tumbler beside her empty beer bottle. Her eyes lifted to Agatha and she lifted the glass to her lips without a word. She looked ready to explode, her throat contracting with the pull of the drink.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She set it down and leaned toward Agatha, speaking low under the murmur of the bar.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You were working toward some relief, Agatha. Are you sure you want to lose the opportunity?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha slid into her set and pressed her knees into Rio’s thigh.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“After how bad I’ve been, I never believed it was in the cards.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio drew in a sharp breath, her eyes holding conflict, flickers of desperation bleeding through her tightly held control. Rio feigned dismissal and returned to her drink, downing half of it before she willingly returned the glass to the table with a too-loud clunk.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The power coursing through Agatha had become intoxicating. She spent the next ten minutes playing with the metal cocktail pick that had come with Wanda’s Martini, spinning it delicately, expertly through her fingers.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Near the end of it, her drink empty once more, Rio had pushed away from the table with a polite “excuse me” and made her way toward the bathroom.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha took the opportunity to order herself a Cherry Whiskey for the simple reason that it would hold her next method of torment.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio arrived just as the glass was set in front of Agatha, and Agatha played like she hadn’t seen her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She plucked the cherry from the glass, popped it in her mouth, and twisted off the long stem. She felt Rio’s gaze on her as she pressed the stem between her lips and drew it onto her tongue.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d barely begun the process of tying it before she heard Rio’s rough voice in her ear, her hand gripping tight to Agatha’s bicep.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha offered her most innocent look.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s cheeks were flushed. To anyone else, it might look like she’d had a proper amount of alcohol.</i>
</p><p>
<i>To Agatha, it looked like victory. She finished tying the stem and slipped it between her lips, placing it on the napkin that held her drink.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You ready, love?”<br/>
___</i>
</p><p>
<i>They called an Uber, their car at Wanda’s a problem for another time. Rio had dragged Agatha into the back seat and held her close. She was nearly vibrating with energy, her eyes glued to the headrest of the driver’s seat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>There were no promises of enduring pain, no quips on Agatha’s continuous, aggravating acts, no rough hands or words at all.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was overcome with the need to push harder, to make Rio’s control snap entirely.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She could think of nothing else as she let her own hand settle on Rio’s arm, stroking the soft skin on the underside of her wrist.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When they reached their home, Rio stepped into the warm night and walked toward the house without a word. Agatha followed two steps behind, studying the quick rise and fall of Rio’s shoulders.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It wasn’t until Agatha stepped through the door that Rio whirled on her, gripping her wrists and pinning them by Agatha’s head. Her mouth was needy, her pace far less decisive than normal, her breathing already ragged as she devoured Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She spoke as she tightened her grip, barely pulling her mouth away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You fucking brat.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha didn’t try to free her wrists, eager to taste Rio, to see where this night would lead them. It felt different, Rio’s words were shaky, nearly a whine.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s tongue slid roughly along hers and Agatha sucked on it, her lips pulling as Rio pulled back to speak again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m going to tease you until you’re begging me to fuck you. I’m going to work you over until your ass is raw and your cunt is desperate to be filled.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was soaked, she had been for nearly the entire day.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hands on hers loosened slightly, her mouth sliding along Agatha’s neck, her teeth pressing sharply into Agatha’s throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ll work you to the edge over and over and over again.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pulled her wrists free and Rio’s hands pressed flat into the door, her forehead hot against Agatha’s neck.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha cooed softly, gripping the back of Rio’s neck in one hand and sliding her other down to cup Rio through her slacks.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Shhh, that’s it sweetheart. What else?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s response was unintelligible, a whine leaving her throat that Agatha had never heard before. Rio’s body sagged against Agatha’s as she mouthed lightly at Agatha’s neck.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha waited silently, more patient than she’d ever been in her life. When Rio said nothing else, she tightened her hold on the base of Rio’s neck.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh? Was that all?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shuddered, her breathing almost erratic.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hummed, shifting her hand just enough to find the waist of Rio’s pants and press low.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio choked out a cry as Agatha’s fingers slid through soaked curls and between Rio’s folds.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha closed her eyes, a gasp drawn out of her as she slipped against Rio’s clit. She kept her voice level, adamant that she take care of Rio like Rio always took care of her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, baby, you need me so badly.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The sounds leaving Rio’s mouth were driving Agatha nearly insane and she put all of her focus into staying calm. She pulled her hand free, drawing a pained cry from Rio, and looked at the glistening trails of slick coating her fingers.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha moaned in appreciation as she used her body to push them from the door.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Upstairs, love. Come on.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She didn’t give Rio a moment to gather herself as she guided them toward the steps and urged her up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tried to turn as they entered the room and Agatha let out a sound of reprimand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Ah.” She pressed herself behind Rio and slid her hands under her shirt and over her stomach. “Rio?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s head dropped back to her shoulder and she said nothing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha dug her nails into the soft skin of Rio’s stomach and dragged down. Her tone was sharper.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio gasped, her hands gripping Agatha’s wrists. Not to stop her, but seemingly to ground herself. She spoke Agatha’s name like a plea.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha offered her another pleased hum and softened her hands.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m going to strip you down and fold you over the side of the bed. Tell me you hear me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was slow with her response and Agatha let her hands press up, nearly distracted by Rio’s lack of bra, and tweaked her nipples hard.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Tell me you hear me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s weight leaned against Agatha further, her body jolting. Her voice croaked between a pant and a cry.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I hear you.” She sucked in a breath. “Agatha–” She stuttered, started again. “Agatha, please.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes nearly rolled back in her skull.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fuck, baby.” She pressed her mouth against the skin of Rio’s neck and bit in warning. “I’m going to fuck you. First with my fingers.” She paused as Rio’s breathing ratcheted up. “Tell me you hear me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s voice was a broken whisper.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I hear you.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hummed softly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Good girl.” She let her nails graze over the hard peaks of Rio’s chest. “I’m going to stop.” Rio whined and Agatha pressed her teeth in again, harder. “I’m going to stop and put on our strap.” She soothed the marks with her tongue. “And I’m going to fuck you with the strap until you pass out.” She pressed a kiss to Rio’s shoulder. “Tell me you hear me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s voice was wispy.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I hear you. Please.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha smiled into her shoulder and pushed Rio’s slacks and underwear to the ground. She was almost too impatient to rid Rio of her shirt, but she wanted her tits to rub against the fabric of their comforter with every thrust. She pulled Rio’s shirt over her head and took time painting her shoulders and back with her tongue and teeth, her hands toying with Rio’s nipples until Rio could barely stand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She stepped them forward and slid her hands to Rio’s lower back, applying pressure.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“On your stomach for me, darling.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nearly collapsed over the bed, her perfect ass pressed out toward Agatha, her hips twitching.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha knelt at Rio’s feet and pulled off her shoes. She ran her thumbs into the muscles of Rio’s hamstrings, massaging up to her ass and groaning at the scent of her. The fucking sight of Rio’s pretty pussy soaked and dripping for her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She spread her and licked a broad stroke along her clit.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio mewled, her hips jolting into the bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha moved her teeth and bit into Rio’s right cheek as she replaced her tongue with her fingers and slipped one inside with so little resistance she knew it wouldn’t be enough.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hips immediately dropped back, her hands fisting into the comforter.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“More.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha used her free hand to slap Rio’s ass right where she’d bitten her. The crack resounded in the room, mingling with Rio’s pants and the slick sound of Agatha’s finger slowly pumping into her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You can beg me. You can whine and cry. You can say my name. That is all I want from your mouth.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha soothed her palm over Rio’s reddening asscheek, her nails scratching softly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Tell me you hear me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s response was muffled, her face pressed heavy into the comforter.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I hear you.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rewarded her with a second finger, this one slipping in as easily as the last.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tried to drive back and Agatha slapped her ass again, this time stilling her fingers. She ran her hand along the endless exposed skin of Rio’s body and folded over her, pressing a kiss to her spine.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“This isn’t enough for you?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio didn’t respond right away and Agatha waited, her hand never ceasing its path on Rio’s skin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Finally, Rio let out a desperate whine.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Please. Please Agatha. I–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She cut off and Agatha started pulsing into her again, Rio’s walls fluttering and dragging at her fingers.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You what, love?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sobbed again and Agatha was certain she had never felt more powerful, desperate that Rio get to ride this out.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tried again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha, I need– Ag–” Rio cut off as Agatha pressed a third finger into her dripping cunt. “Fuck!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her fingers against Rio’s front wall as she fucked her deep and slow, watching every shift and twitch of Rio’s body, listening to every sound that fell from her mouth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Despite it not being enough, she could feel Rio clenching around her, could tell she was close. She kept her pace until it was nearly too late, lost in the vision of Rio beneath her like this. She withdrew as Rio’s hips began to arch from the bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s cry was delicious, a sound that dragged at the edges of Agatha’s control. She stepped away and pulled open the second drawer of their wardrobe, retrieving the harness already fitted with the strap.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was nearly mindless as she undressed, her skin prickling with the cool touch of leather as it settled around her thighs and hips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She walked toward Rio and settled behind her, fingers teasing along Rio’s hip bones. She was losing patience with the game and she wanted to hear Rio fall apart.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She parted Rio’s folds with her thumbs and pressed the head of the dildo against her entrance.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She watched enraptured as she sank in the first inch easily, her hands sliding up and curling around Rio’s hips as an anchor.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was all sound, all desperate movement as she tried not to drive her hips back and bottom out on the cock. Agatha jogged her hips, sinking in further, and Rio cried out again, losing the fight to keep still. She sank herself further and Agatha couldn’t bring herself to punish her or withdraw again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She drove her hips forward, her hips meeting Rio’s ass as she fucked the strap as deep as it could reach and ground into Rio with force.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her next thrusts were rough, her hands curling harshly into Rio’s skin as she lost herself in the motion, in the burn of her calves and thighs and hips, in the sound of Rio taking her so greedily.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was writhing against the sheets, Agatha’s name falling from her lips and not much else.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt like a god.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She fucked Rio as Rio’s walls closed around the toy and slipped her hand low to brush her fingers over Rio’s clit.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The orgasm that ripped through Rio was nearly violent, the cock nearly stilling with the pressure of it as Rio sobbed into the comforter and her hips arched back into Agatha as tremors wracked through her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It seemed to last minutes, Agatha offering short thrusts to rub the head of the dildo against Rio’s g-spot.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When Rio collapsed, nearly boneless against the sheets, Agatha felt the need to do it again. And again. And again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She ran a hand soothingly over Rio’s back and spoke quietly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m going to fuck you again.” She hummed, shifting as she felt the way her pussy throbbed. “Tell me you hear me.”</i>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha spent her days off in the home she’d lost so many years before, in the home that was now, once more, settling into the marrow of her bones. Some of it had remained the same; the creak of boards, the pattern of soft light from the sun through the open winds, the way the bedroom door hung slightly off kilter. Other things had changed; the sheer amount of plants that grazed and grabbed at her clothing as she passed, the fickle knob that controlled the front right burner of the stove, the cat toys that tended to be tucked under every feasible chair, table, or piece of furniture.</p><p>After Rio’s attempt at burning down the house, Agatha had placed her on the couch and done the cooking herself. Rio had only complained until Agatha had stuffed the whittling materials into her hands and placed a laptop in front of her.</p><p>As Agatha had cooked, she’d heard the murmur of a voice start, stop, and restart as Rio watched an online tutorial.</p><p>It felt <i>good.</i></p><p>Agatha felt good.<br/>____</p><p>On the second day of her time off- neither of them bothered to pretend Agatha was going to leave or try to take space. Agatha felt the flow of their conversation take a subtle shift. They’d been reminiscing on their time at Quantico, on their first year as agents. It was easier, their lives before Nicky, the time before such an agonizing loss.</p><p>But that was truly the smallest portion of their lives together, and Agatha felt her heart begin to ache as they talked about the first weeks in this home, about getting married, about finding out the IVF had worked.</p><p>Agatha felt the wrench of the wheel, the opening of the dam. She breathed slowly, her eyes already watering.</p><p>Before she could slip into the grief of it, Rio said something that startled her.</p><p>“Have you visited him?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart thudded painfully, a prickling, harsh shame clinging to her answer.</p><p>“I—” There was no excuse and Agatha didn’t attempt to make one. “No, I haven’t.”</p><p>Rio nodded, surprising Agatha with a hopeful smile.</p><p>“Will you go with me?”</p><p>Agatha felt like the wind had been knocked from her. She wanted to deflect. She felt the sudden urge to run, to bury herself. It felt like an old reflex, one that she dismantled after three slow breaths. She was honest instead.</p><p>“I’m scared.”</p><p>Rio was leaning against the L of the couch, her legs crossed under her. There was something warm and excited in her gaze.</p><p>“I know, Agatha. But…” Rio looked out the window, her lips curling up, her eyes going soft and vacant. “When you left, it took me six months to drive myself there.” Rio sighed. “It took six more for me to open the car door and walk to his headstone.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say one year was better than nearly six. She didn’t say anything, her voice caught in her throat.</p><p>Rio looked back to her.</p><p>“It hurts. I think I knelt in the grass in front of his headstone for three hours and cried. It rained for the last thirty minutes and I couldn’t bring myself to leave until Wanda showed up and sat beside me.” Rio chuckled. “She was adamant that she would stay until I was ready to go. She shivered for all of two minutes before I felt too bad to keep her there.”</p><p>Agatha leaned her head against the cushion. She was sitting sideways to face Rio and her knees were drawn to her chest.</p><p>“She definitely did it on purpose.”</p><p>Rio laughed.</p><p>“I know. But she took me to get ice cream like I was seven and she told me she’d do this with me as much as I wanted her to.” Rio sighed softly. “She went with me for months. Every week. Most of the time I didn’t make it out of the car. And no matter what, she would drag me to that little ice cream shop and we’d sit at this awful table with bright purple, pleather booths.”</p><p>The description sparked something in Agatha, a nostalgia that floated and grazed against her chest.</p><p>“Lavender?”</p><p>Rio looked surprised.</p><p>“You know it?”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened and she worked through it.</p><p>“Yeah, I used to take Nicky there when you would go on your hikes. He was always devastated when you’d put on your boots and he couldn’t put on his. Ice cream was the only thing that helped.” Agatha wiped her eyes. “He called it ‘The Purple Place.’”</p><p>Rio looked like she was near tears now too, her eyes bright.</p><p>“Wanda said that she used to take him there when she babysat.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, her grin overtaking the way her grief pulled at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>“I think Nicky got far more ice cream than he was supposed to.”</p><p>Rio smiled, both of them sitting in silence for several moments, before she continued.</p><p>“One day I didn’t call Wanda. One day,” Rio huffed, head shaking, “it was a really fucking bad day. And I felt so overwhelmed. I drove until I was in the parking lot. I got out of my car and found myself in front of his headstone again.” Rio looked down. “I missed you. And I was so angry with you. And somebody at work had asked if we’d spoken. Then I’d gone out in the field and got slammed in the chest with a two-by-four and I was just… defeated.” Rio looked at her hands. “I talked to him for hours, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha could imagine it even though she hadn’t been there in years.</p><p>
<i>An excruciating, unbearable pain wracked Agatha’s chest. It was like her heart had been placed on the anvil of a blacksmith and overworked, like she’d been laid out on the counter of a butcher and cut into scraps. Her eyes burned with exhaustion and an endless stream of tears that had dried out her skin and left it raw.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She stared at the smallest of caskets and felt a terrible, desperate, caustic wish that the body inside belonged to anyone but her son. She hoped it with such ferocity that her throat curdled and closed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Nicky had gone quietly, had passed at four-forty-three in the morning while her and Rio had slept on either side of him. They’d set up cots in the office beside his hospital bed, and had stayed there every night knowing that any could be his last.</i>
</p><p>
<i>He had stopped going to the hospital. There was nothing left to be done that would not make his departure uncomfortable. Comfort. The doctor had said that comfort was the only thing his mothers could possibly give him.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s hope had been left like an imprint on the seamless vinyl floors in room 744. When their doctor looked at them with tears in her eyes and told them what they already knew.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She imagined that hope lost looked like footprints. She imagined that those footprints were not the first in that room, they would not be the last. Her sleep-deprived mind could see them, shadows of all shapes and sizes from people who had stood in that place and stared at the fading light of their partners, their parents, their friends, their children.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stared at the lowering casket and her ears rang with the continuous, sharp beep that had startled them awake two days before. She had wailed, her throat going hoarse with it as she pulled Nicky’s body to her chest and lost herself to an all-consuming grief.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d held him until she’d felt her muscles shaking, about to give way. She’d laid him back and collapsed into the chair behind her, her eyes falling to Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hated her. She hated her. She hated the empty, haunted look in her eyes. She hated the tears that collected but didn’t fall. She hated her because it was all she could do to release any of the coalescing agony that was suffocating her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She couldn’t hear a thing over the ghostly shrieking that signaled the end of Nicky’s life and her own. It blared in her skull as the funeral director called Wanda forward to speak. She watched her friend’s mouth moving, watched tears fall, and saw the way Wanda’s chest shook. Acid filled Agatha’s mouth. Wanda couldn’t know a fraction of what this felt like. Agatha hated her too.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When Rio stepped forward, Agatha saw the same look, the hollow husk, like whatever had made Rio was scooped out. She expected the ringing would continue, that she’d be spared whatever words Rio had managed to collect.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She was wrong.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hands shook, her fingers gripping tightly to the small podium. She sounded as hollow as she looked.</i>
</p><p><i>“Nicholas–” Her voice broke and Agatha hated her. “I knew he was special from the moment he was placed in Agatha’s arms. Every parent thinks that about their child, but…” Rio smiled and it looked like it hurt more than anything ever had, “Nicky was </i>special.<i> I used to wonder how I got so lucky. He was bursting with creativity and curiosity and so much love I wondered how his heart would handle a world like this.” Rio’s voice warbled and she pressed her lips together. “I realize now he was never meant to. He used a lifetime of good in three short years because I think he knew, in some way, it was all he would get.”</i></p><p>
<i>Agatha felt a clang, like a gong struck in her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio flattened her palms on the podium and stared at it for several long moments, her jaw clenching and unclenching as she fought to speak.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha waited. And this time, when Rio tried to speak, her voice cracked in half and all that escaped was a sob.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha felt as if she was watching through glass. A part of her, the part that knew how to love, battered against her hate and urged her forward. But Agatha didn’t move. She watched as Rio shattered. As Wanda went to her. As they stepped down together.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha didn’t speak, didn’t wax poetic about how lucky she’d been. Life was cruel. It had been, and always would be. She stared at the wood surrounding the body of her son and wished she’d died with him.</i>
</p><p>Agatha drew in a slow breath.</p><p>“I want to talk to him too.”<br/>____</p><p>Rio drove, her discomfort only visible when they hit a particularly jarring pothole. She’d asked Agatha if she was sure, had assured her that she hadn’t meant they needed to go right away.</p><p>But Agatha had suddenly felt as if it had to be today. Anxiety swam in her body, laying waste to her composure as she sat stiffly in the passenger seat and tried not to panic. She stared blankly through the windshield and felt the panic rising anyway. The closer they got, the more Agatha found herself unable to breathe. Her chest was tight, her lungs weren’t listening to the commands of her brain to draw in and release.</p><p>Rio turned onto the road before the cemetery and suddenly Agatha heard it. The high-pitched, endless whine of a machine. The worst sound she’d ever heard. The sound that meant Nicky was gone forever.</p><p>She closed her eyes and tightened her hands into fists on her thighs.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t draw in her next breath. She opened her mouth and there was nothing.</p><p>The wail grew louder in her ears, screeching, piercing. She opened her eyes and everything was blurry. She tried to flatten her palms and she felt the curl of Nicky’s many blankets under her palms. Agatha tried to breathe again. And again. And–</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s voice cut through the ringing, slamming Agatha back into the present with jarring clarity. She sucked in a breath and it shook on the way out.</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled around her own, her voice following, soft and firm.</p><p>“Breathe, love. That’s it.” She ran her thumb over the back of Agatha’s hand. “That’s it, that’s my girl.”</p><p>Agatha pried her shoulders back from where they’d folded forward and opened up her lungs.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened.</p><p>“Don’t apol–”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No, I’m sorry for forgetting how to love you when we buried him. I’m sorry Wanda had to be the one to hold you.”</p><p>Rio was quiet for several seconds, her thumb stilling on the back of Agatha’s hand. It picked up again and Rio sighed.</p><p>“We both forgot, Agatha. But I promise you, I won’t forget again.”</p><p>Agatha believed her. She looked over at the side of Rio’s face, traced the determined line of her jaw.</p><p>“I promise too.”</p><p>Rio linked their fingers together. She pulled Agatha’s hand to her lips and kissed her knuckles.</p><p>“Are you ready?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, frowned, then looked back toward the windshield. They were parked near the pathway that wrapped its way through the cemetery. She felt a swell of terror rise only to be stemmed by the thought of Rio sitting right here so many times before.</p><p>She stared at the rows of headstones, the flowers and statues and pictures that were placed with so much love.</p><p>“Yes. No.” Agatha huffed. “I don’t know.”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s about right. We can sit right here, Agatha. We can try again another day.”</p><p>Agatha felt herself drawn, a warmth in her chest, the tightening of a small hand around two of her fingers. She shook her head.</p><p>“No. He’s been waiting long enough.”</p><p>Agatha pushed her door open and stepped down on the pavement. The weather was turning, a warmth to the wind that feathered through her hair, and she let it bolster her as she took several steps and stopped at the start of the paved pathway.</p><p>Rio joined her, their fingers linking again. She didn’t say anything further. She waited for Agatha to move and simply moved with her.</p><p>Agatha’s feet carried her to Nicky’s grave with surety. She slowed as it came into view, the black stone standing glossy and bold against the grass surrounding it. Agatha breathed through the sharp scour through her chest, her teeth clenching as she felt the unfairness of it all with harsh clarity. Her son was cold stone. Her son was taken by the earth and he would not be returned to her.</p><p>She barely felt the tears as she read his name carved, the letters light gray.</p><p>
<i>Nicholas Harkness-Vidal</i>
</p><p>Agatha looked at the inscription below and the words crashed into her with a visceral intensity.</p><p>
<i>”When we die,” asked Rabbit, “where do we go?”<br/>“Into the hearts of those who have loved us the most.” said Bear.<br/>“That way we’re together forever.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha’s nose stung as a sob pressed against her teeth. She gently pulled her hand from Rio’s and stepped onto the well-watered grass, drawing to a halt in front of the headstone.</p><p>The grief was like a roiling ocean, flooding her limbs, seeping into her bones and drowning her lungs. She stared as memories of Nicky the months before his death crashed through her, his pretty blue eyes dull, his cheeks without the baby fat that was supposed to follow him into his teens. She lived through every memory, agonized, until they began to slow, until the clothes he wore were no longer too big, until his head was full of beautiful, brown locks that she could curl around her fingers.</p><p>She re-lived every moment. Every one of his giggles, every cry that eased when she stepped into his view. Every time he reached for her, every time he called her mama. She remembered with a bittersweet, aching, desperate love. She felt the baby-soft skin of his feet as she covered them with the smallest of socks.</p><p>She watched, once more, the dedication and single-mindedness with which Rio loved their son. Nicky and Mommy go hiking. Nicky and Mommy painting time. Nicky and Mommy do the dishes. Nicky and Mommy cook breakfast. That adventure had been banned very quickly.</p><p>Agatha lowered herself down, her knees sinking into the cool earth. She took in the many dried flowers that decorated Nicky’s gravestone: Lilies, Lavender, and Poppies. Devotion, Calmness, Restful Sleep, and she smiled through the unending stream of tears.</p><p>“Hi baby. It looks like your mom has been taking the best care of you. I’m sorry I’ve been gone for so long.”<br/>_______________</p><p>The following weeks were filled with stolen moments and moments of deep comfort. Rio returned to work under the condition that she remain desk-side. Agatha and the team took a boring weekend trip to Texas to provide their insights on a case involving a fraud ring exploiting disaster relief funds.</p><p>Agatha had called Rio the first night, her eyes looking blankly at the ceiling of her hotel room for two full hours before she’d given in.</p><p>
<i>”Agatha, is everything alright?”</i>
</p><p>Agatha smiled at the first notes of Rio’s voice, the tension in her chest releasing. She closed her eyes.</p><p>“If you call letting William whine about his relationship woes for a full work day ‘alright.’”</p><p>She heard Rio’s amusement, her smile, when she responded.</p><p>
<i>”Has he still not spoken to Eddie?”</i>
</p><p>Agatha frowned before she understood what Rio was referring to.</p><p>“Oh. No, that was sorted out. Apparently Eddie had picked up extra shifts to pay for a birthday present for Will.”</p><p>Rio snorted.</p><p>
<i>”That seems like the most logical conclusion Will could have come to.”</i>
</p><p>Agatha laughed.</p><p>“Will’s defense is that his birthday isn’t for months.”</p><p>
<i>”I don’t know if I’d call that a defense. Did he finally ask Eddie?”</i>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“No. Apparently he was acting weird enough that Eddie asked him what was wrong. They’re all sorted out now except now Will is worried that Eddie will get annoyed because he freaked out over nothing.”</p><p>Rio huffed out her amusement.</p><p>
<i>”God, they’re young.”</i>
</p><p>“So young.” Agatha closed her eyes and settled into the scratchy sheets below her, her head resting uncomfortably on the pillow. “Rio?”</p><p>
<i>”Yeah?”</i>
</p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p>There was a catch in the pattern of Rio’s breathing, then,</p><p><i>”I miss you too.”</i><br/>_____</p><p>It took Agatha two weeks to open her go-bag while Rio was in the room. She drew out the album and set it gently on the bed.</p><p>Rio’s eyes fell to it and widened.</p><p>Agatha set the vial of the very first destroyed flower beside it and met her eyes.</p><p>“I kept all of them.”</p><p>Rio watched earnestly, her expression forming both surprise and anticipation.</p><p>Agatha climbed into the bed, her legs tucking beneath her as she placed the album down on the comforter. She pressed the vial gently into Rio’s hands before opening the first page.</p><p>Every other flower that she’d received from Rio was perfectly dried and preserved, the fragile petals intact and still full of pale, pretty color. She touched one of the stems beneath its petals, blue Salvia, before carefully placing the book in front of Rio.</p><p>Rio’s hands trembled as she stared at the album, her eyes watering as she ran her fingers over the pages.</p><p>“They kept so well.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her knees to her chest and watched as Rio began to sift through, pausing for long periods.</p><p>Agatha knew the name of each flower, knew their meanings, could remember receiving each letter and the agony she’d felt every single time. It was different now, that pain faded like graphite on a piece of art worked over toilessly. Smudged, erased, remade.</p><p>Tears filled Rio’s eyes as she turned to the page with the butterfly weed.</p><p>Agatha had pressed a part of it for herself after mailing one to Rio, had marked it in the album as a punishment. It had been like the slam of a gavel, the twelve tones of a clock striking midnight. She’d sobbed in the pressing of it, in the placing of it in this album with the knowledge that she had severed her connection to Rio.</p><p>The page was warped with long-dried tears and Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>“I tried to stop it, you know.” Agatha’s voice was weak. “I placed that letter in the mailbox and I woke the next morning in a panic. I was still drunk. I practically ran to the post office because I couldn’t drive.”</p><p>Rio sniffed, her fingers shaking on the page as she let out a small chuckle.</p><p>“You can’t stop mail in-route.”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“I had my badge on me. I expect if I’d been more coherent– or even slightly less disheveled– I might have been able to do something other than stare blankly at the postal worker.” Agatha sighed. “I decided at that moment that it had been the right thing, that I’d been selfish to allow you to hope for so long.”</p><p>Rio wiped her eyes as she ran her fingers along the edge of the page.</p><p>“I took my first vacation starting the day I received that letter. I cried for two days and–” Rio closed her eyes. “I drove all the way to New York.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Rio sniffed again.</p><p> </p><p>“I was devastated. And angry. And I loved you and hated you and I just wanted to scream and see if you felt anything at all.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe.</p><p>“What changed your mind?”</p><p>Rio smirked ruefully, her eyes blinking open to find Agatha’s.</p><p>“Not what. Who.”</p><p>Agatha put the pieces together rather quickly.</p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p>Rio chuckled.</p><p>“Wanda.” She shook her head. “Do you know she has, and has had, my location tracked for the past four years?”</p><p>Agatha let out a laugh remembering her recent conversation with Wanda.</p><p>“I’m not surprised.”</p><p>Rio shrugged.</p><p>“She followed me, was about thirty minutes behind me. She found me sitting outside your apartment and rolled down her window with this look on her face…” Rio blew out, her lips pursing. “I don’t think I would have survived without her. Sometimes she doesn’t even feel real.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“The patience of a saint and the intuition of a witch.”</p><p>They shared a somber laugh, both of them lost in the agony of that year, of that month, of that day.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat.</p><p>“It’s behind us, okay?” She pressed a flat palm over the butterfly weed. “Thank you for showing me this, Agatha. I– it means a lot more than you know.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a breath, steeling herself.</p><p>“There’s one more page.”</p><p>Rio lifted her hand, glancing at Agatha before flipping to the end.</p><p>Sitting in the center of the page was Agatha’s wedding ring. Laced through the center were four freshly pressed flowers, their petals still carrying a vibrancy that spoke of life and strength and hope. Honeysuckle, red Salvia, Zinnia, Valerian. <i>Love bound. Forever mine. Lasting affection. Readiness.</i></p><p>Rio’s breath caught, her eyes filling with fresh tears, these ones pooling heavy and falling in streams down her cheeks. Her next breath caught on a sob and Agatha slid her hand behind Rio’s neck, her fingers tangling in her hair as she pulled her in.</p><p>Rio went easily, her face pressing into Agatha’s throat, her hands curling into Agatha’s shirt.</p><p>They remained like that, tucked into one another, for several long minutes. Agatha felt the anvil of her guilt fall free.</p><p>She took her first full breath in years and closed her eyes.</p><p>Eventually, Rio spoke quietly into her skin.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Rio pulled back and met Agatha’s gaze with red-rimmed, bright eyes.</p><p>“Will you come home? Please? I don’t want to miss you anymore.”</p><p>Agatha would never forget Rio’s words at that moment. She would never forget how desperately she’d needed to hear them. She would never forget the wild surge of joy that sprung to life in her chest, the kind that had been choked out and suffocated for so long.</p><p>“I’ll never leave again.”<br/>_____</p><p>Agatha sat on the bench and stared at the fountain– recently turned on– and kept her eyes anywhere but Alder.</p><p>They’d taken to having their sessions here, outside in the garden with space to breathe, places to look.</p><p>Alder hadn’t even really asked in the session after their first walk. She’d stepped from her office, lifted her brows at Agatha where she sat in the waiting room, and tilted her head toward the door.</p><p>Agatha felt less suffocated here.</p><p>“I’m moving back in.”</p><p>She waited with bated breath, uncertain what she expected from Alder. Maybe words of caution, maybe disappointment that they were moving too quickly after so much harm passed between the two.</p><p>Alder drew in a quiet breath and smiled.</p><p>“Isn’t that exactly the thing you’ve worked so hard for?”</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>“You don’t think it’s too much too soon?”</p><p>Alder’s severe face looked softer here, the sunlight gentling to her sharp features.</p><p>“You have dedicated yourself– the both of you have dedicated yourselves– to a future intertwined. You chased a happiness you once thought no longer existed and you expect me to chastise you for finding it?” Her words weren’t harsh, nor were they mocking. Alder looked proud. “Will you be remarried?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks burned.</p><p>“That’s… another matter...”</p><p>
<i>Agatha was curled around Rio’s back, her arms wrapped protectively over her hip, her nose pressed into the soft hair at the base of her neck. Their left hands were linked, both of them carrying a once-familiar, now new, weight. Agatha toyed with the warmed silver around Rio’s finger, turning it gently against her skin. She was nearly asleep as she thought about the coming weeks. They’d talked about moving Agatha back in, and had talked excitedly about what would follow. Logistics had been peppered in when either of them managed to think beyond the bubble they were basking within.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d talked until both of them were nearly exhausted, their eyes drooping and their conversation blurring into warm laughter and mumbled promises.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nuzzled closer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio grunted weakly in acknowledgement.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha spoke into the skin of her throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I call Wanda as my maid of honor. You can have Vision.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio snorted tiredly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“One, no. Two–” She yawned and let out a sigh. “You don’t need to worry about that.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The words were said so easily that Agatha almost let herself slip into unconsciousness. She blinked awake instead.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio hummed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha waited in silence for Rio to expound, feeling her slowly tense beneath her. She pulled back, eyes squinting in the dark.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t what my what.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio blew out a breath.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Kinky.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha smacked her chest lightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio glanced at Agatha from the corner of her eyes looking terribly suspicious.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I–” She cleared her throat. “I might have… forgotten to file.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shot upright in bed, her eyes blowing wide.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Forgotten!? How– What? I’VE BEEN COMMITTING TAX FRAUD FOR FIVE YEARS!?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio grimaced, an apologetic look on her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Not actually! We’ve both been filing separately and accurately with the knowledge we had.” Rio covered her face with her hands. “When you handed me those papers…” She shook her head. “I was so fucking devestated. I shoved them into the box of your stuff you left behind and I forgot about them. I found the envelope when I went through the boxes to bring you some of your clothes.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stared at Rio, watching as Rio’s fingers slowly spread over her eyes so she could peek at Agatha. Both of them stared. And stared. And then Agatha’s laughter fell out of her like a gunshot and Rio was close behind, their bodies shaking as Agatha collapsed back into the mattress.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes were wet as she tried to parse through the revelation and calm herself at the same time. She managed to stop laughing for a solid two seconds and tried to ask Rio a question.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Have you reported–” Her voice shook with laughter again and she forced out, “it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was doing something close to lamaze breathing as she answered.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I planned… to file–” Rio sniffed after a series of giggles. “properly this year. I was going to tell you too–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha scoffed weakly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh you were?” Both of them curled into one another, the collective sound of their laughter and the way their bodies shook only driving the other to deeper levels of delirium. Agatha wiped her eyes. “Were you? In between me–” Agatha cackled. “treating you so awfully and trying to ruin my own career?” Agatha heaved. “Were you really? After we fucked each other in Greece? Or was your plan to do it after slapping my mother in the face?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio howled, her lips spread wide over her perfect smile as she laughed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha sobbed with it until she was boneless. Until both of them slowed their breathing, until they were sunken into the soft, familiar mattress with their shoulders pressed together and their fingers linked.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They remained quiet, both of them calming, and Rio tilted her head left.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha, I have to tell you…” She closed her eyes. “We’re still marr–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She hadn’t finished her sentence before they’d collapsed back into their laughter.</i>
</p><p>“We were never actually divorced.”</p><p>Alder took it in stride.</p><p>“Saves you some paperwork.” Her rigid posture looked softer sitting on the bench. “Agatha, do you remember when you first came back? The rules I put in place?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, lips quirking up.</p><p>“I asked if we could negotiate.” Agatha shook her head. “You run a tight ship.”</p><p>Alder smiled, seeing Agatha attempt to deflect for what it was. She ensured her sincerity was heard.</p><p>“You did everything that I asked of you. Even when it was hard, even when you yourself felt as if you were cracking under the weight of your distress. You fought for yourself. You broke down your ego and you asked for help. You allowed yourself to receive it.”</p><p>Agatha shifted in discomfort, her eyes anywhere but Alder.</p><p>“I didn’t have much of a choice.”</p><p>Alder’s voice was stern.</p><p>“You did. You could easily have repeated the outcome of our first attempts at therapy. There were dozens of ways you could have given up on yourself and you didn’t. That deserves recognition, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha felt the urge to make light of it and barely refrained. She couldn’t manage to say something sincere but she let Alder speak without interruption.</p><p>Alder smiled.</p><p>“I know this is hard for you. I won’t torture you.” Alder settled back against the bench. “We can look at extending the time between your sessions. Look at every other week instead of weekly.”</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“You want to meet less?”</p><p>Alder met her confused gaze and lifted her brows.</p><p>“You are taking and utilizing the strategies we speak about. You are working through the emotions that suffocated you when we started. You’re putting in the work, Agatha. I think you’ve noticed for some time that some of our sessions have become more informative rather than rife with conflict.”</p><p>She had. Sometimes the drain she normally felt after therapy was nearly non-existent.</p><p>Alder smiled again.</p><p>“The goal is that, one day, you won’t need me at all.”<br/>___</p><p>Agatha and Rio sat side by side in the guest bedroom with their eyes locked onto Scratchy’s pen. Boggle was sitting below it, his tail slightly puffy as he stared into the enclosure. He began to pace below it and Rio slowly leaned over to drop a treat on the ground. Agatha stuffed a carrot top into the enclosure for Scratchy. She spoke quietly to avoid spooking the animals.</p><p>“It seems like it’s going well?”</p><p>Rio looked anxious.</p><p>“I guess? I’ve never introduced pets before.”</p><p>Agatha reached over and closed her hand over Rio’s.</p><p>“You did all the research. You called like four pet stores and two veterinarians. We’ve done everything they said we should do.” She turned and pulled Rio’s hands to her chest. “We will keep the door closed unless we can supervise them, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her shoulders settling as she watched Boggle chirp toward Señor Scratchy.</p><p>Below there were footsteps and the sounds of boxes being dropped and moved. Rio looked toward the door.</p><p>“Wanda is going to call up any second.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“I’m sure sh–”</p><p>Wanda’s voice interrupted.</p><p>“Is there a reason the person moving has yet to lug one of her many boxes?!”</p><p>They laughed as they stood, Rio leaning down to scoop Boggle before he could hide in the guest bedroom.</p><p>Wanda was standing at the bottom of the steps as they rounded the corner, her hands on her hips. She looked more amused than actually irritated.</p><p>“At least you have your clothes on.”</p><p>Rio feigned shock.</p><p>“We were introducing the pets!”</p><p>Wanda grimaced.</p><p>“Ew, don’t call it that.”</p><p>Agatha snickered and took the final steps as Vision walked in with a large, taped box. He set it on a stack of others and leaned back to blow his hair out of his face.</p><p>“I am quite flabbergasted that you were able to acquire so much clothing in such a brief jaunt of time.”</p><p>Rio scoffed.</p><p>“That’s been her skill since we met. You should have seen the shit she left Quantico with. It didn’t make sense. We had like, four drawers total and she filled my entire vehicle. I had to make a second trip to get my stuff.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Please, you had to make a second trip because you realized you’d left the strap under the bed.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed even as her cheeks flushed.</p><p>“You interrupted my cleaning checklist!”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled up and the look she shot to Rio was filthy.</p><p>“Are you saying it wasn’t worth it?”</p><p>Wanda groaned and pressed her hand into Agatha’s face, smushing her nose and shoving her head back.</p><p>“I’m having regrets about the amount of effort I put in to get you back together.” She pushed at Rio’s shoulder. “Stop traumatizing my husband and get one of your wife’s boxes.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes went a little starry at the word but she held fast to her spot on the floor.</p><p>“I’m in recovery.”</p><p>Agatha, after knocking Wanda’s hand from her face, rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You were cleared for all levels of activity like four days ago. I remember because we celebrated vigorously.”</p><p>Vision cleared his throat.</p><p>“As enrapturing as a return of your coital activity is, I am going to depart.”</p><p>Agatha made a loud gagging sound at his chosen words, intent to roast him as she followed to the sedan, but Wanda beat her to it.</p><p>“The sound you make choking on Rio’s co–”</p><p>The collective reprimand of “Wanda!” coming from the three of them was enough to distract the group for several minutes.</p><p>As they were finishing with the remaining boxes, Agatha slipped into the kitchen to retrieve a bottle of wine and four glasses. She held them up as she returned to the living room.</p><p>“Wine break before we carry the boxes upstairs?”</p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes.</p><p>Vision offered an easy, accepting smile.</p><p>“Delightful.” He took a glass and sat down on the sofa, his eyes searching around the room. “Should I extend the babysitter? We might as well unpack and organize for you.”</p><p>Agatha snickered as she filled his glass, then followed with the three others.</p><p>“I won’t fight you.”</p><p>Vision grinned.</p><p>“But Wanda will happily fight you.”</p><p>Rio groaned as she sat with her glass, her hand on her ribs.</p><p>“I don’t think I’m going to be up for round two. You’ll have to leave me behind.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her brow as she sat beside her. She circled her fingers over Rio’s wrist and slowly moved Rio’s hand to the ribs of the left side.</p><p>“So close.”</p><p>Rio dropped the act with a smirk and set her feet on the table as Wanda settled into a space beside Vision.</p><p>Wanda leaned back to poke through the boxes, her hand balancing a full glass over the pale sofa, and eventually found the one she was searching for. She dragged it around the couch and patted the top.</p><p>“I packed your puzzles, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips pursed in distaste.</p><p>“If I never do another puzzle again, it’ll be too soon.”</p><p>Wanda slid her nail into the tape and cut it. She pulled open the top to free a 1000 piece puzzle and held it out.</p><p>“What do you mean? You don’t want to glue together and hang this gorgeous picture of baked beans in the house?”</p><p>Rio laughed and leaned forward to pull the puzzle into her hands. She gave Agatha a look.</p><p>“Baked beans?”</p><p>Agatha snatched the puzzle and stuffed it back into the box.</p><p>“I went with Billy and he was adamant.”</p><p>Rio’s amusement increased, her eyes sparkling.</p><p>“We’ll have to have him come build it with you.”</p><p>Agatha closed the lid of the puzzle box.</p><p>“We have to do no such thing. Wanda and Vision will be taking it back to their car.”</p><p>Vision’s brows lifted.</p><p>“Now that is unfortunate. We’ve actually reached capacity for cardboard on the leather seats. I’m sure you understand.”</p><p>The wine break ended up taking an hour and they went through two bottles before Vision slapped his thighs and stood.</p><p>“I’m going to call the babysitter to let her know we’ll be a bit late.”</p><p>Wanda set her glass down, her cheeks red from the buzz of the wine as she looked distraught at the stack of boxes.</p><p>“I think I should have an exemption from any further pack-muling.”</p><p>Agatha was warm and slightly drunk, her smile lifting easily on her lips.</p><p>“Would you like to state your case?”</p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t think you want me to do that. You’ll end up feeling like you owe me.”</p><p>Rio snorted.</p><p>“Honestly? True.” She lifted the nearly empty bottle and offered it to Wanda. “For you to finish as you watch from the couch.”<br/>___</p><p>It only took thirty minutes to move the boxes to their respective rooms and set them somewhere out of the way for Agatha and Rio to go through later. Wanda remained seated for all of it, relishing her final glass of wine and making comments every time they passed.</p><p>Agatha felt the elation and the anxieties and the excitement that came with everything she owned being returned to the house that had been her home. She watched as Rio peeked at the labels before placing the boxes in the proper location. She was so intentional, so careful, and Agatha felt the whisper of something needy coil through her.</p><p>By the time they’d finished, that whisper had become a roar.</p><p>Rio closed the door behind Vision and Wanda, her eyes hazy from the wine. She looked unburdened, her lithe frame at ease as they walked back to the living room.</p><p>Rio looked at the puzzle box, the only one remaining in the living room, and gave Agatha a cheshire grin. She reached for the top puzzle.</p><p>“You know, we could get started on the baked beans tonight. That way we could have it hung up by–”</p><p>Agatha caught Rio’s wrist quickly, the movement setting off Rio’s instincts in turn.</p><p>Rio adjusted, pulling herself free and aimed for the box again.</p><p>Agatha tackled her.</p><p>They hit the couch hard, the feet of it sliding on the rug as it shifted with the force.</p><p>Rio yelped, immediately working against Agatha as they wrestled for control.</p><p>As it always seemed to be with them, neither was capable of half-effort.</p><p>There were elbows that bumped a little too hard, nails that dug a little too deep, and Agatha felt each one between her thighs. She loved when Rio was rough with her. She thrived on the precipice between pain and pleasure.</p><p>In a sly move, she rolled both of them onto the ground, dislodging Rio’s current hold on her arm and waist. She only freed herself enough to lunge back in, her fingers scrabbling to capture Rio’s wrists and pin them. She nearly succeeded, her breath heaving, when Rio showed the true state of her healing and thrust her hips up, dislodging Agatha before she could settle.</p><p>Agatha fell into the couch face first and felt Rio’s arms begin to wrap securely around her, ready to lock her in place.</p><p>Agatha acted without hesitation, her mouth opening against the skin of Rio’s arm and biting. Hard.</p><p>It didn’t break skin, but Rio yelped, yanking her arm back and setting Agatha free to whirl around.</p><p>They stared at one another.</p><p>Agatha’s body was on fire, something ignited in her, something heady and desperate. She stared at Rio’s eyes, the pretty brown nearly black in the yellow light of the living room.</p><p>The wild look in her eyes began to retreat; a cool, unflinching control seeping into place instead. Her voice held a warning.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, her lungs functioning in a very limited capacity. She took a step back, a nearly animalistic urge to run surging through her. She felt adrenaline flood through her, her fight or flight kicking into high gear as she watched Rio carefully.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a step forward, her breathlessness doing nothing to curb the power radiating from her.</p><p>“Don’t you dar–”</p><p>Agatha bolted. She pivoted hard and awoke every muscle in her right leg and hip and abs to propel her toward the kitchen.</p><p>She heard Rio lunge after her and her heart rate skyrocketed, pounding in her ears as she skidded across the kitchen tiles. She used both hands to grab the door frame leading to the hall and she flung herself forward toward the steps.</p><p>The adrenaline crashing through her urged her on, her feet hitting every two steps and her hands propelling her up with the railing. The anticipation mingled with a primal dose of fear, the kind that always came into play when one was being chased, no matter who the pursuer was.</p><p>Agatha could feel the steady pulse between her thighs as she heard Rio’s first thud onto the steps and then… nothing.</p><p>Agatha finished her sprint to the landing, flung herself into the bedroom, and nearly faceplanted over a stack of boxes in her haste. She scrambled to her feet and whirled, her eyes searching and finding no sign of Rio in the hallway.</p><p>She breathed deeply, trying to listen over the sound of her heart and the rush of her lungs, and slowly backed into the bathroom and closed the door. She locked it behind her and pressed her back to it.</p><p>And she waited.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>Four minutes passed. Then five more. Agatha had heard nothing in the bedroom, nothing in the hall.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>She knew it was a trap. So she waited some more. She waited until she started to feel ridiculous and finally opened the bathroom door.</p><p>The room was entirely empty, the boxes knocked over exactly as she’d left them, and Agatha narrowed her eyes.</p><p>She peeked under the bed, behind the curtains, in the closet, and then took her first step toward the door to the hall.</p><p>The bathroom door that she’d pushed open moments before shifted to reveal Rio from where she was leaning against the wall.</p><p>Agatha’s heart leapt into her throat and she froze, feet rooted to the floor as she waited to see what Rio would do; whether she’d give chase or start another bout of wrestling.</p><p>Rio held up her arm, the teeth indents there still visible from Agatha’s bite. She said nothing.</p><p>Agatha shifted from one foot to the other, ready to bolt. A part of her simmered with worry that Rio might actually be mad. She railed against the anxiety, letting a smug tone slide into her next words.</p><p>“All I see is a means to victory. Don’t be a sore loser, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s expression remained calm, though her brow raised slightly.</p><p>“You think I’ve lost?”</p><p>Agatha’s body buzzed, a hazy sensation flooding her as she heard the command in Rio’s tone, the confidence behind it. Agatha clenched her teeth, trying to regain a sense of clarity, of control. She swallowed past the blaze of want that coursed through her belly and chest and huffed.</p><p>“I’ll get to the door before you do.”</p><p>Rio shrugged noncommittally.</p><p>“Maybe. But you’ll make this worse for yourself.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s eyes on her like a collar, her throat tightening as she felt her desire to run halve. Excitement curled in her lungs and she kept up her facade.</p><p>“Oh? What am I making worse?”</p><p>Rio stepped to the bed and ran her fingers along the headboard, touching a ring of metal that had been artfully placed in the wood long ago.</p><p>“Your punishment.”</p><p>Agatha’s breathing stuttered as she watched Rio’s fingers toy with the metal ring.</p><p>“You have to catch me to punish me.”</p><p>She considered bolting then and there. A part of her wanted to. But ever since they’d returned to one another, she’d found herself desperate to keep Rio close. There would be space for enduring play at a later time.</p><p>Rio pulled her eyes from Agatha, a sick confidence that she’d already sussed out what Agatha was thinking, feeling.</p><p>“Get me the cuffs, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha boiled, hating and adoring Rio’s smart fucking mouth and her assuredness. She stared at Rio as Rio pulled the covers back.</p><p>Rio eventually glanced up, sincerity on her face.</p><p>“There’s room for reward too, if you’re good for me.” She nodded toward the drawer. “Get me the cuffs. I won’t ask again.”</p><p>Agatha held out for a solid three seconds, her pride warring with the need that had made itself known an hour before. She felt the siren song of Rio’s command lap at her control and she yanked the drawer open to pull out the smooth leather cuffs and their metal chain. She tossed them at the bed, the clank of links sounding starkly as they hit the sheets.</p><p>Rio looked at the cuffs, then back to Agatha. She nodded toward them.</p><p>“Hand them to me.”</p><p>Agatha seethed even as she felt the slick pooling between her legs.</p><p>“You have hands.”</p><p>Rio's lips flattened, her eyes flashing with warning, and Agatha bit back a gasp. Rio casually pulled her shirt over her head, revealing her lightly-toned stomach, the olive skin looking soft in the warm light. She wasn’t wearing a bra and Agatha’s mouth watered.</p><p>She walked toward Rio and pulled the cuffs back into her hands. She placed them in Rio’s now-waiting hands, her eyes on Rio’s perfect tits.</p><p>Rio hummed.</p><p>“Good. Take your clothes off.” She paused, then met Agatha’s eyes. “All of them.”</p><p>Agatha bristled, her hands moving without thought toward the hem of her shorts. She pressed them down, taking her underwear with it, and let them pool on the floor for her to step out. She pulled her shirt over her head and unclipped her bra at her back. They dropped rhythmically to the rug.</p><p>Agatha stood completely naked in front of Rio, her skin pebbling in the cool, evening air. She held out her hands.</p><p>“I’m sure you’re feeling pleased with yourself.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes dragged along her thighs and ribs and chest and throat until they met Agatha’s.</p><p>“I’m very pleased with you.”</p><p>Agatha felt the flush in her chest and cheeks at the words and she drew in a steadying breath that did very little to steady her. She blinked, and blinked again, feeling like she was sinking into warm water, every part of her caressed.</p><p>Rio studied her reaction with the start of a smile, her eyes flashing with pride. Rio’s fingers settled flat against Agatha’s stomach and she tilted her head to the bed.</p><p>“On your back, Agatha. Cuff yourself.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. Cold slashed her cheeks and she was split into two, her attitude simmering through the desire to listen to Rio’s commands.</p><p>“Make me.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer to her, her hands settling on Agatha’s sides, her fingers slotting between the divots of her ribs. Her touch was precise, her posture grew more rigid, her gaze hardened, and Rio’s nails curled into her, digging into her skin. She looked like a goddess, an air of infallibility radiating out as she spoke again.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio reached up, brushing Agatha’s hair from her forehead, trailing her nails down her cheek, and she let her palm press flat against Agatha’s sternum, just below her throat. “You’ll do it of your own volition or you’ll go untouched the rest of the night.” Rio’s hand slid up to claim Agatha’s throat. “Do you want me to stop touching you?”</p><p>Agatha drew in a sharp breath, the foggy smolder, the blissful warmth, crashed through any remaining resistance and found herself shaking her head before she could stop herself.</p><p>Rio hummed, letting the hand on Agatha’s side slide to cup Agatha’s cunt firmly.</p><p>“Good. Do as I said.”</p><p>Agatha bit back a whine as Rio’s fingers dipped teasingly into the slick and retracted. She felt the slide of her bare thighs as she pushed onto the bed. She laid onto her back, the cool material on her heated spine sparking arousal, and took the cuffs as they were outstretched toward her. She tightened the first around her left wrist and followed suit with the right, the chain long and loose between them.</p><p>She held them out with attitude even as her stomach twisted in knots of anticipation.</p><p>“Happy?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Incredibly so.” She climbed onto the bed, her own body bare, and circled her hand around the chain. “Maybe not as happy as you.” She tugged lightly. “It feels so good, doesn’t it? Doing what you’re told?”</p><p>Rio loomed over her, her eyes searching, expectant, <i>knowing.</i></p><p>Agatha’s body responded with a whine, something almost pathetic, and Rio’s eyes went dark with lust.</p><p>Rio twisted the chain and the friction from the cuffs tingled up Agatha’s arms.</p><p>Rio breathed slowly, her voice quieter, almost reverent.</p><p>“There’s my girl.”</p><p>Agatha felt tears prick in the corners of her eyes and the sound that left her was keening and raw. She clenched her teeth together, her eyes closing against the sheer depth of desperation that wanted to make itself known to Rio.</p><p>Another tug on the cuffs, this one sharper, and Rio’s words were stern.</p><p>“None of that. Eyes on me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes opened on their own, her body out of her control, and she gasped.</p><p>“I need—“ Agatha drew in a sharp breath and her hips squirmed by Rio’s hips. “Touch me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t loosen her grip on the chain.</p><p>“Is that how you’re supposed to ask?” She feigned milling it over. “It’s been a while. I can forgive your forgetfulness just this once.”</p><p>Agatha burned as she added.</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>Rio hummed.</p><p>“That’s not quite it.”</p><p>Agatha reached for Rio only to be stopped short. She gnawed at her lip and let her arms go slack.</p><p>“Rio, please touch me.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, chest rising and falling sharply. Her voice was unsteady as she released the chain.</p><p>“No. Not just yet. But that was much better.” She tilted her head. “Turn over.”</p><p>Agatha tensed, the idea of losing sight of Rio stirring a discomfort in her gut.</p><p>“I want to see you.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, likely to correct her, and then her lips pressed tightly. She stared at Agatha for several long seconds, her chest rising and falling too quickly to be entirely in control.</p><p>She pressed her hand against Agatha’s abdomen and spoke softly.</p><p>“Scoot down.”</p><p>Agatha frowned but followed the instruction, making space between her head and the headboard. She’d barely settled before Rio was moving, shuffling her knees until she was able to lift one over Agatha’s face.</p><p>Her fingers coiled into Agatha’s hair and tightened to a painful degree.</p><p>“Are you seeing enough?”</p><p>Agatha whimpered, her linked hands scrabbling against Rio’s back and tugging her down.</p><p>She got a picture perfect view of soaked folds before her mouth was opening against them. She groaned and Rio let more weight settle on Agatha as she used her free hand to grab hold of the headboard.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t fully aware of the sounds leaving her mouth as she devoured Rio, her tongue pressing flat against Rio’s clit.</p><p>Rio panted above her, his hips rutting down as she fucked herself on Agatha’s tongue.</p><p>“Fuck, I love your mouth.”</p><p>Rio’s nails scraped against Agatha’s scalp.</p><p>Agatha moaned, Rio’s slick coating her lips and cheeks and chin as she let her teeth drag lightly against Rio’s clit. She closed her lips over it and sucked once, twice, before returning her tongue as Rio’s rightful seat.</p><p>Rio came undone violently, her hips grinding down, her hand fisting even tighter in Agatha’s hair, her head thrown back as she trembled through wave after wave. Agatha licked her clean, nearly delirious as she tasted all she could of Rio. She whined as Rio dropped her hair and pressed her face away due to overstimulation.</p><p>Rio took several slow, deep breaths, gathering herself before she dismounted, returning to her position on her knees at Agatha’s side.</p><p>Agatha gasped in air, only then realizing how little oxygen she’d had access to, and listened as their breathing mingled.</p><p>She huffed.</p><p>“Oh yeah. What a punishment.” She closed her eyes. “I feel so punished.”</p><p>Rio grunted, and suddenly Agatha felt hands on her hips, fingers digging in with force as she was bodily turned over onto her stomach.</p><p>She yelped, squirming.</p><p>“R–”</p><p>The first strike of Rio’s hand against her ass was merciless, the sound of it loud despite their panting. Agatha mewled, her mouth opening against the sheets, her breath catching as she tensed for a follow-up.</p><p>Rio leaned down, lips brushing her ear before her teeth nipped sharply.</p><p>“You thought we were done?” Her hand ran soothingly over the sting, then her nails pressed in. “We’re just getting started.”</p><p>She struck again, the same spot, and Agatha pressed her hips into the bed.</p><p>“Fuck– sh– Rio. Baby–”</p><p>The third followed and Agatha cried out loudly, her hands curling into fists where they were stuck under her body.</p><p>Rio reached under and pulled her hands free, her movements rough as she dragged Agatha toward the hook sitting so nicely in the bed. She attached Agatha’s hands, the positioning forcing Agatha’s shoulders into a strained position.</p><p>Rio lifted Agatha’s hips until she had her knees under her. She hummed as she slid her hand down Agatha’s sore cheek and let her fingers dip into her Agatha’s drenched slit.</p><p>“Do you have more to say?” She pressed two fingers easily, just to the first knuckle, and stroked along Agatha’s g-spot. Her other hand struck again. “I asked you a question.”</p><p>Agatha could barely breathe, her gasps muffled but still loud as Rio continued to tease her entrance.</p><p>“No.” She tried to shake her head. “No, I–”</p><p>Rio’s hand struck home, the sound and the pain and the force of it nearly driving Agatha mad. She felt her legs press together, felt the gush of wetness, and heard Rio coo as she stroked her spine.</p><p>“Oh fuck, Agatha. Did you just squirt? You filthy fucking slut.” Rio’s tongue pressed between her labia and lapped at her. She bit Agatha’s ass. “My fingers won’t do the job tonight. You’re practically begging for my cock.”</p><p>Agatha felt like she might come just from the gravel in Rio’s voice and the sensations flooding her body. She felt Rio slip from the bed, rummage around, and then climb back into position, this time settling behind Agatha with her hands dragging mindlessly across her body.</p><p>The head of the strap pressed between her thighs, sliding over her clit and collecting Agatha’s slick. The motion repeated, over and over, until Rio readjusted and pressed the tip against Agatha’s entrance.</p><p>Agatha waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually she yanked on her cuffs and begged.</p><p>“Please fuck me. I need you, baby. Please, please, please I–”</p><p>Rio struck her ass just as she slid the dildo nearly to the hilt, no resistance found as Agatha greedily pulled her in.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure if she came or if it just felt so fucking good that the next several minutes felt like one long orgasm. She wrapped her hands around the chain of her cuffs and held on for her life as Rio railed into her, the slap of their bodies and her cries drowning everything out. Rio set a ruthless pace, her fingers digging into Agatha’s hips as she pulled her back onto the strap nearly as hard as she drove it into her.</p><p>Agatha’s words became a babbled jumble of pleas until no sounds escaped and her entire body tightened, her cunt pulsing and spamming around Rio’s cock.</p><p>Stars danced across her vision and she went entirely boneless, her body twitching involuntarily as she tried to recover and failed.</p><p>Rio was quick to act, gently sliding free and helping Agatha settle before releasing her hands.</p><p>Agatha sucked in air, her eyes watering, and she felt Rio’s body curl around her back.</p><p>Rio pressed her lips into Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“That’s it, love.” Rio’s fingers carded through Agatha’s hair, moving it and letting cool air touch the damp skin beneath. “You’re okay.”</p><p>Agatha sobbed, sucking in air, and she let herself be held as Rio released her wrists from the cuffs. She felt the haze slowly drift away, replaced by the heavy weight of sleep. She pressed a kiss to Rio’s hands and let her eyes slip closed.<br/>_____</p><p>Agatha drew in a slow, even breath, her heartbeat drumming in her chest as she listened to the conversation from the entryway. She heard a warm, deep laugh followed by Rio’s lighter one and smiled despite herself.</p><p>Her smile faltered as she heard footsteps approaching and she stood from the couch, wiping her palms against her jeans.</p><p>Rio appeared first, a delight in her eyes that eased some of Agatha’s anxiety. Following behind her in beige slacks, brown, leather dress shoes, and an orange-brown turtleneck was the man Agatha had seen on Christmas.</p><p>His hair was in cornrows and she saw the edges of tattoos peeking from where his sleeves were pulled toward his elbows. He met Agatha’s eyes and the smile was so sincere, so disarming, that Agatha found herself smiling back without the drag of anxiety.</p><p>He stepped forward, his hand reaching out toward Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha.” She took his hand and he covered both with his other hand. “Real glad I finally got to meet ya.”</p><p>His accent had a slight drawl that Agatha could only place due to Rio telling her he’d grown up most of his life in New Orleans.</p><p>“Likewise.”</p><p>He held onto her hand for a beat longer than expected and then released, his eyes falling to Rio.</p><p>“You’re putting me on the grill? You sure about that?”</p><p>Rio patted his shoulder.</p><p>“Agatha will supervise the spice selection to ensure our other guests survive.”</p><p>Grim turned toward her and winked, a smirk quirking his lips.</p><p>“You ain’t gonna begrudge a chef his spices, right?”</p><p>Agatha could see the mischievous glint in his eye and she grinned.</p><p>“I’m sure we can come to an agreement we’re both satisfied with.”</p><p>Grim hummed.</p><p>“Mmhm. So we’re only throwin’ too much on Rio’s plate, huh?”</p><p>Agatha laughed then and she motioned toward the kitchen.</p><p>“That’s exactly right. I made sure to stock the pantry. You should have seen what she had in there before.”</p><p>Rio balked, shooting a glare Agatha’s way.</p><p>“Okay, rude. I have been injured!”</p><p>Grim wrapped an arm around Rio’s shoulders, his much larger frame enveloping her.</p><p>“It’s alright, Rio— we all know cookin’ ain’t your thing.”</p><p>Rio pouted, her arms crossing over her chest.</p><p>“I’ve changed my mind. You’re both uninvited.”</p><p>Agatha snickered.</p><p>“But it’s a party <i>for</i> Grim.”</p><p>Rio huffed.</p><p>“Too bad.”</p><p>Grim squeezed Rio’s shoulders and released her. He nodded toward the kitchen.</p><p>“I’ma go make myself at home in that kitchen. Y’all holler if you plannin’ to run me back to the airport.”</p><p>He moved easily through the home and Agatha found herself watching after him. Knowing that Rio was able to find him, that she’d been able to reconnect and relearn the most important person in her young life, was enough to knock the breath from Agatha’s lungs.</p><p>Rio wrapped an arm around her waist, her smile soft and searching.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her and grinned, her arms circling Rio’s neck.</p><p>“I’m ready to bond. I need a new Cornhole partner.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth dropped open.</p><p>“It was <i>one</i> time! Nearly seven years ago!”</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“I never forget a betrayal.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, her fingers tightening on Agatha’s waist.</p><p>“You were late, did you want me to play by myself? Vision offered out of the kindness of his heart.”</p><p>Agatha heard the giggles of two familiar twins from outside and smirked at Rio as she let go. She called back while walking to the door.</p><p>“If you had any loyalty, yes.”</p><p>She opened the front door to a surge of tiny bodies and laughed as Billy and Tommy wrapped around her legs.</p><p>Billy’s shrill voice was muffled by her leg.</p><p>“Agatha!” The double ‘f’ warmed her heart as it always did. “We made cupcakes with dad.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the tray in Vision’s hands.</p><p>“Make sure to save me one.”</p><p>Billy nodded, already distracted as he moved toward Rio in the living room. Vision smiled warmly at her and followed.</p><p>Wanda pulled Agatha into a hug, her own arms full of grocery bags. She smiled.</p><p>“You look like you’re where you’re supposed to be.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“It feels like it too. Like home.”</p><p>A car door closed in the driveway and Agatha looked up to find Alice, William, and a boy Agatha knew as Eddie from William’s ceaseless oversharing walking up the sidewalk.</p><p>Will had somehow both dressed up and gotten punkier. Nice pants and a purposefully worn sweater with more eyeliner and newly revealed piercings in his ears. He waved at Agatha and Wanda, eyes bright.</p><p>“This is crazy! House party with my boss. And the Director.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow.</p><p>“House party my ass. Please do not attempt a keg stand in front of Wanda’s children. Or me for that matter.”</p><p>William grinned.</p><p>“It’s okay. Eddie brought his beer funnel.”</p><p>Eddie’s eyes widened slightly and he offered a charming smile, hands out.</p><p>“I did not bring a beer funnel.” He came to a stop beside Will and held out his hand. “Eddie. It’s really nice to meet you both. Will never stops talking about you guys.”</p><p>True to form, Will offered a smile and didn’t dispute the claim.</p><p>Agatha took Eddie’s hand, deciding that she liked him.</p><p>“It’s okay, I’m sure Rio still has hers. I think Will just never stops talking.”</p><p>Eddie grinned.</p><p>Will reached forward and detached their hands.</p><p>“I’ve decided Eddie is going home. Say bye.”</p><p>Alice groaned.</p><p>“Whatever you do, please move. I’m carrying your food and mine because somehow you both just painted your nails.”</p><p>Agatha stepped aside so Alice could walk her two trays inside.</p><p>Will, Eddie, and Wanda trailed after her and Agatha watched for a few moments before closing the door and joining them.</p><p>Lilia arrived next in a flurry, her hands filled with bags that somehow didn’t contain any food for their gathering. After saying her hellos, she looked to Agatha.</p><p>“A tour.”</p><p>It wasn’t really a question or a command, and Agatha would have laughed in her face if she weren’t set on making a good impression on Grim.</p><p>If Lilia’s smirk was anything to go by, she knew this too and was taking advantage.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and pointed.</p><p>“A short one.”</p><p>Will and Eddie began to follow and Lilia waved a hand at them.</p><p>“Take the next one.”</p><p>Agatha stepped into the kitchen first and Lilia took out a basket to set on the counter. It looked rustic, the wood woven and a pair of cloths draped over the bowl of it. Inside was a loaf of bread and several containers filled with– Agatha tried to get closer, seeing what looked like salt in one, but Lilia had already started walking to the next room with her armful of bags. There was a thin, wooden stick poking out the top of one that Agatha stared at as they stepped into the hallway.</p><p>Lilia placed what looked like a rock with some kind of symbol on it down on a shelf in the hallways and kept walking.</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“Usually a tour is given by the host.”</p><p>Lilia scoffed.</p><p>“Please, like I need a tour.”</p><p>She stepped into the covered patio room and walked to one of the plants to place a small, sealed jar in the dirt. She walked to the window and stuck her hand in her bag, retracting it with a clenched fist. She continued mumbling as she sprinkled something on the sill.</p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p>“Lilia–”</p><p>Lilia turned and pulled free a broom. Not one Agatha expected to be useful, but one made of twigs and twine. It smelled like cinnamon as it was held toward her.</p><p>“When you have time, put this over your door.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t have a chance to reply snarkily before Lilia had walked from the room.</p><p>By the time they returned to the living room, Lilia’s bags had grown considerably lighter and Jen had arrived with six bottles of wine.</p><p>Billy and Tommy had everyone’s attention, their limitless energy used to explain what they were working on for their science fair projects.</p><p>Agatha held back as Lilia joined them, her chest flooding with an emotion she didn’t recognize. It was soft, gentle, but melancholy; peaceful and longing in one. There were so many people that she cared about now, so many filling the space of the couch and sitting in chairs pulled from the kitchen.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha allowed herself to imagine the face of one more. A small boy, nearly nine years old, with brilliant blue eyes and brown hair that hung messy around his ears and over his eyes. He was listening with rapt attention, the kind of focus kids get when they feel a sense of protectiveness over younger ones.</p><p>Nicky’s eyes lifted and met hers, a toothy smile painting his face as he faded from her mind.</p><p>She swallowed tightly and looked away.</p><p>Grim was watching her and he caught her eyes with a smile. He tilted his head toward the kitchen and walked out.</p><p>Agatha’s heart felt swollen and sensitive as she followed.</p><p>He opened the fridge and began pulling out plates of food, speaking smoothly.</p><p>“Figured we’d go on and start the grillin’.”</p><p>Agatha stepped in to pick up the marinated shrimp and chicken and carried them to the kitchen table. Grim set down a ground beef mixture with chopped andouille sausage and a plate of eggplant slabs, marinated jackfruit, and portobello mushroom caps.</p><p>He returned to the counter and picked up a collection of spices and ingredients he’d already pooled together. He dropped them on the table, some falling, and he huffed out a laugh.</p><p>“Maybe I’m overdo’n it, but I gotta make a good impression, ya know?” He leaned toward her conspiratorially. “Don’t know if you hear, but my sister’s wife's here. Gotta make sure she knows somebody in this family can cook.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile was genuine.</p><p>She liked how easily Grim called Rio family, how he claimed her as a part of him. She could also see why he and Rio were so close.</p><p>Grim seemed to have Rio’s ability to see and to understand.</p><p>He wasn’t forcing anything, wasn’t trying to distract her, but he was offering her a gentle reprieve if she felt so inclined to take it.</p><p>“I’m sure you’ve already won her over. I wouldn’t worry about it.”<br/>____</p><p>The marinade for the shrimp was worcestershire, fresh lemon, Louisiana hot sauce, soy sauce butter, and a handful of spices and brown sugar. They let it sit as they moved onto the chicken.</p><p>Agatha and Rio had scored the chicken and made the marinade the night before at Grim’s instruction, letting them sit in the fridge overnight. They pulled the chicken quarters and patted them dry, setting them aside to come to room temperature.</p><p>Grim laughed as Agatha asked him about his work.</p><p>“Long story, but I’ll keep it short. Got a finance degree, did some financial advising for a bit, hated every minute.” He shrugged, his eyes light. “So I went back to school, got a PhD in Finance–” He laughed at the look she gave him. “No, hold up, I needed it to teach. Figured helpin’ kids made more sense than puttin’ up with all that mess in advisin’.”</p><p>Agatha smirked.</p><p>“Why finance? Seems like an interesting path.”</p><p>Grim nodded, expression growing a bit nostalgic. His voice was calm but he spoke with conviction.</p><p>“I went a long time with nothin’.” Gettin’ somethin’ was hard as hell, and it meant a lot to me to hang on to it. It ain’t the flashiest subject, but truth is, a whole lotta folks out there been kept dumb on how to handle their money. Feels good to do somethin’ about that.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, hands idle as Grim seasoned the beef with salt, pepper, Creole seasoning, garlic, paprika, and cayenne. He mixed the spices in and placed the bowl between them and they began to form the mixture into loose balls.</p><p>The quiet wasn’t uncomfortable, but Agatha had so many questions she wasn’t certain how to broach. She forged on anyway.</p><p>“Rio told me that was the reason she found you. Your university’s faculty page.”</p><p>Grim smiled.</p><p>“It’s true.” He moved to the sink to wash his hands, his face pensive. He continued after turning off the faucet. “She told me it looked like, at least in records, that I’d gone and disappeared. The foster system is messy at the best of times, downright tragic at its worst.” Grim picked up the mushroom caps, looking idly at the package. “When my now-parents adopted me, they changed my name.”</p><p>Agatha could hear the conflict in his voice. His easy demeanor seemed to slink behind a small screen of deep wounds and she regretted stepping into a space he might not want her.</p><p>“You don’t need to–”</p><p>Grim’s expression cleared and he aimed a small headshake her way.</p><p>“Nah, it’s good to say, good to talk about. One of the only memories I have of my mom before she passed, before foster care, was her holding my face and telling me, ‘your name is your story, do not let it be taken from you.’” Grim gave a rueful chuckle. “Silly, being seven, I thought nobody could take my name if they didn’t know it. I went by Grim because I thought it would protect me. In some ways, it did.</p><p>“When my parents decided to adopt me, they were ignorant. They expected my life might be easier if I had a ‘normal name.’” Grim pressed a hand against his chest. “I was Jonathan for a few years.”</p><p>Agatha kept her flare of outrage to a simmer and waited.</p><p>Grim hummed.</p><p>“It took until I could properly verbalize my sadness at what they’d done, until I no longer feared that they’d get rid of me, for it to make sense to them. They spent a long time trying to make it right.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, another question slipping out.</p><p>“And now?”</p><p>Grim smiled.</p><p>“Grim was the name I kept even when I was Jonathan. It’s how I was known by the person that had loved me the most besides my mom. It’s what my friends in school called me.” His lips quirked up. “I could tell you a dozen stories about the meaning. In Old English it meant fierce or cruel, the Proto-Indo-European root is believed to be a word that imitates the sound of thunder. But really, as a kid, I just thought it was really fucking cool.</p><p>“Ekon is my name, it is what I am known as by students and those that I meet. But Grim is for family. Anyone that loves Rio is a part of that.”</p><p>_____</p><p>Agatha watched the boys climb up Rio’s chair, her arms wrapping around them as she stood, Billy and Tommy squealing while they dangled from her arms.</p><p>She smiled, once more studying the brightness around her, the familiarity, the warmth. Vision and Wanda were sitting, both laughing at their children as they wriggled free from Rio’s grasp.</p><p>William, Eddie, Alice, Jen, and Lilia were spread around the fire pit, their conversations idling as they watched the show unfold.</p><p>Agatha wanted to step outside, wanted to join them, but the feeling from earlier returned with lacerating force. This was the life Nicky could have had if the world weren’t cruel. These were the people that would have loved him and protected him.</p><p>The loss of what might have been was suffocating.</p><p>Tears pricked at Agatha’s eyes and she heard footsteps coming from the hallway behind her. Grim came to a stop by her side, his voice soothing.</p><p>“I don’t put much stock in Vodou myself, but I got a friend who lives by it. She once told me– back when we barely knew each other– ‘I see you carryin’ a heavy spirit. You don’t gotta walk with it alone. Can I sit with you?’ It stuck with me. Thought it was a beautiful thing, just offerin’ presence, a little community. I know you got folks who’d sit in the grief with you, no question. But… if you’ll have me, I’d be happy to be here now.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t wipe her tears as they slipped down her cheeks, her eyes unmoving from the scene unfolding before them.</p><p>“What else does Vodou say?”</p><p>Grim hummed.</p><p>“She told me death ain’t an end. It’s a transformation. The dead ain’t gone; they walk with us,  part of the livin’, part of the community. They say when a child passes, it’s ‘cause they were born close to the spirits, too close to stay here long. They come to remind us just how bright a soul can burn.”</p><p>Agatha’s vision blurred further and she sniffed, letting out a sigh.</p><p>“I do think he’s here. With me. With Rio. He’s taking care of us now.”</p><p>Grim was quiet for a time, his hands in his pockets.</p><p>“Rio showed me all Nicky’s memories; all the pictures, the little videos. I could see right away he was special. No doubt about that. But what really got me? Was watchin’ my sister be a mom. The way she loved: so open, so fearless, like she ain’t never been hurt before. That came from you. From the hope and safety you gave her. The kind she never had ‘til you. I always told myself, if I ever got the chance to meet you, I’d make sure to tell you thanks.”</p><p>Agatha felt a bubble of self-loathing expand in her throat.</p><p>“I don’t deserve a thank you, Grim. I–” She remembered her conversation with Rio, the apologies that passed between them, and sighed. “I left. I took away her hope and safety.”</p><p>Grim shrugged.</p><p>“We all gotta walk our road, stumble a little. But ain’t that somethin’? You brought it back.”<br/>______</p><p>Eventually, Agatha and Grim joined the others outside, Agatha’s tears dried and wiped from her cheeks. She let herself fall into conversations with her friends, let herself be seen and loved and understood even though some of it grated on her deeply-rooted need for self-preservation. She ruffled Will’s hair into his eyes and got to know Eddie. She listened to Lilia, Alice, and Jen talk about absolutely nothing and she didn’t hate a moment of it.</p><p>Wanda and Vision sat back and allowed their sons to be the stars of the show, their lively, childhood energy buzzing through the party as they played and asked question after question that meant everything and nothing.</p><p>It was good, and Agatha let that goodness consume her.<br/>______</p><p>Agatha looked at the photograph in her hands, her smile soft and wide as she picked out the funniest, strangest details.</p><p>Eddie and Will were side by side, their grins matching. They looked picture-perfect until closer inspection revealed each one had a hand on the others’ ass. Alice was standing beside them, her focus shifted from the lens to the ass grabbing, her brows lifted in amusement.</p><p>Jen was standing beside Lilia, her smile bright, a glass of wine in one hand. The other was holding Lilia’s cinnamon broom in just the right way so that it looked like a spiky crown on Lilia’s head. Lilia herself was looking up, one hand aimed toward Jen as she flipped the bird.</p><p>Vision and Wanda were both looking to their right at the incredible feat of Grim, clearly laughing, as he held both Billy and Tommy upside down by a leg. The boys looked like they were having the time of their lives, their eyes closed as they cackled, their hair hanging floppily and their hands swinging.</p><p>Agatha looked at herself, at Rio. Both of them had looked away, to one another, after the tenth photo attempt. There was a shared joy, a shared amusement, a shared love that sat so apparently in their expressions. Agatha’s eyes locked onto the easy lacing of their hands between them and she lifted it to where Rio was sitting at the coffee table with Billy and Tommy.</p><p>“This is insane.”</p><p>Rio looked up, a baked bean puzzle piece in her fingers, and she chuckled.</p><p>“I think it’s fitting.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and she lifted it back onto the mantle between photos of their wedding, photos of Nicky. When she looked back, she saw Tommy and Billy leaning in front of Rio, clearly having taken her piece to place it as if they’d found the spot instead.</p><p>Agatha grinned, and Rio looked up and met her eyes once more. Agatha let out an easy sigh.</p><p>“I love you, you know?”</p><p>Rio melted, her eyes softening. She glanced at the boys, then began to dislodge herself. She received the expected resistance, both of them letting out twin cries of concern and dragging her back to the couch.</p><p>Rio laughed, instead holding out her hand toward Agatha.</p><p>“I love you too, you know?”</p><p>Agatha walked toward her, placing herself far enough away that she wouldn’t be drawn into the travesty of a puzzle being made in her house. She smirked at Rio.</p><p>“I know.”</p>
