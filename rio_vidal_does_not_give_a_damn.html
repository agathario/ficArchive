<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio, a florist living in New York, has spent years keeping her distance from her hometown and the people in it. She’s built a life on independence, casual flings, and avoiding attachments. But when her estranged stepsister, Jen, pressures her into returning to their small town to provide flowers for her wedding, Rio reluctantly agrees—mostly for the paycheck.</p><p>Back home, Rio is immediately thrown back into the lives of Jen and her close-knit friend group, including Agatha, a single mom who has always been responsible and put everyone else first. Agatha has her hands full with her son, her failing bookstore, and dealing with her unreliable ex, Wanda. She doesn’t have time for distractions—especially not Rio, who she remembers as Jen’s aloof, rebellious stepsister who never seemed to care about anything.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio’s eyes snapped open at the buzzing on the nightstand.</p><p> </p><p>Blinking against the unfamiliar surroundings, she tried to place where she was. Memories from last night rushed forward as she reached to silence her phone before it woke—</p><p> </p><p>Oh. <em>Oops</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She definitely didn’t do that again.</p><p> </p><p>Right?</p><p> </p><p><strong>Shit</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>She definitely did.</p><p> </p><p>The name of the woman next to her had completely slipped her mind. Still fumbling for her phone, she racked her brain for any hint of it. The buzzing of whiskey. Trashy neon signs, maybe? And, without a doubt, the feeling of said woman’s hands on her body.</p><p> </p><p>But her name? It started with a C… maybe?</p><p> </p><p>Pressing the volume button to mute her phone, Rio had just started untangling herself from the sheets when a groggy groan sounded beside her.</p><p> </p><p>She winced. What? She didn’t want to talk to Chrissy. Sue her. It was time to go.</p><p> </p><p>Sliding out of bed, she used her phone light to scan the floor for her clothes. Jeans, shirt, boots—left and right, thank you—where the hell was her jacket?</p><p> </p><p>Hanging from the bedroom door. Of course.</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed it carefully, moving quietly so she wouldn’t wake—</p><p> </p><p>“Leaving already?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned, caught mid-exit, phone clamped between her teeth, one foot in the air as she struggled with her boot zipper.</p><p> </p><p>The woman—brunette, from what Rio could tell in the dim light—propped herself up on one elbow. “No breakfast?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio plucked the phone from her mouth, flashing the lazy grin she saved for moments like these. “Didn’t want to overstay my welcome.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman laughed softly. “You’re cute. You could’ve stayed.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tried not to let her face react. “Maybe next time.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t need the light to know the woman was rolling her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe her name started with a K.</p><p> </p><p>Kaley. Definitely Kaley.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed again, vibrating in her hand. She glanced down.</p><p> </p><p>Jeni 🥬 (The Worst Kind of Vegetable)</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked at the contact name before hitting ignore. Automatic. Instinct.</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer Kale calling at any hour was never a good thing, but at 2:30 AM? Yeah, definitely not answering that. Also, just send a text?</p><p> </p><p>(Sure, okay, there might have been a few unread messages in her inbox, but in Rio’s defense, she had been busy. With Karly. And, more importantly, rent was due, which meant longer hours at the shop.)</p><p> </p><p>Not like she and her stepsister talked much anyway. When was the last time Rio had even seen her? Six years ago? Sounded about right.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed again.</p><p> </p><p>Three times in a row?</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Rio was lucky tonight—twice in one evening—and someone really was dying.</p><p> </p><p>“You wanna get that? Sounds important,” Kathy—no, Kara—murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose, shaking her head. She probably should answer. “Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Kelsey said, sitting up, letting the sheet drop to her waist, “before you go, I have one more thing for you.”</p><p> </p><p>And maybe Rio licked her lips at the silhouette in front of her. Fine. But it’s not like her type had changed in the last three hours.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could step back toward Kendall, her phone buzzed again.</p><p> </p><p>She groaned, already walking toward the hallway. “I’ll be right back.”</p><p> </p><p>Three doors later, she found a bathroom the size of a closet, locking herself inside. She took a second—just a second—to avoid looking at her own reflection.</p><p> </p><p>Then she slid the answer button.</p><p> </p><p>Waited.</p><p> </p><p>Ten full seconds.</p><p> </p><p>Then:</p><p> </p><p>“Rio’s Crematorium, you ghost ‘em, we roast ‘em. Rio speaking, how can I help?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Jen’s voice, exasperated.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, did I not just say Rio speaking?”</p><p> </p><p>She could practically feel the look on Jen’s face. Eyebrow raised so high it might never come down.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, it took you long enough to answer. I had to make sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed a sigh. “It’s late, Jen. Unless someone’s dying—and I mean actively—this could’ve waited until morning.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>A long one.</p><p> </p><p>Long enough that Rio pulled the phone away from her ear—twice—to check if the call had dropped.</p><p> </p><p>“Jen. What do you want?”</p><p> </p><p>Another pause. Then a deep inhale, like Jen was bracing herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you coming?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. “Not that it’s any of your business, but maybe I was a couple hours ago before you rudely woke me and -”</p><p> </p><p>Shit.</p><p> </p><p>She really needed to stop doing that.</p><p> </p><p>“And?”</p><p> </p><p>“Never mind.” Rio scrubbed a hand down her face. “To answer your question, no, I’m not currently coming. Jen, is there a point to this?”</p><p> </p><p>A beat.</p><p> </p><p>Then: “Please tell me you didn’t forget.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio frowned, glancing at the time. August 30th. 2:45 AM.</p><p> </p><p>…Shit.</p><p> </p><p>She totally forgot.</p><p> </p><p>“No, Jeni, I didn’t forget,” Rio lied smoothly. “But catch me up anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>“My wedding, Rio!” Jen screeched.</p><p> </p><p>Rio winced, holding the phone away from her ear. The third time this phone call by the way. </p><p> </p><p>Oh.</p><p> </p><p>Right.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s wedding. The one Evanora - evil stepmother - had personally requested Rio work.</p><p> </p><p>The one where Rio had to pack a thousand roses into her van on Tuesday morning and drive to Westview.</p><p> </p><p>Ugh.</p><p> </p><p>Well.</p><p> </p><p>At least she could mess with Jen first.</p><p> </p><p>“Wedding? You’re getting married? Who’d you trick?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned, even though she knew Jen wouldn’t hear it in her voice. She never did.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio! Please tell me you’re kidding, because I really won’t find a florist in the next eight days.”</p><p> </p><p>Okay, yeah, that was enough fun for now. Rio sighed. Had she mentioned it was nearly three in the morning? She was pretty sure she had.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Jen. As the only florist in the family, I will be leaving here at precisely 7:69 AM with my van packed full of the one thousand yellow lilies you requested.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yellow li—” Jen cut herself off. “Rio, roses. Red roses. Please, for the love of God, tell me there will be red roses at my wedding.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio barely bit back a laugh. “Relax, Jen. I got it covered. I do have a contract with Evanora, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good. Because I personally don’t want to see the wrath of Evanora if you cancel on her only daughter’s wedding.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stilled.</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Ouch.</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Jen must have realized it, too, because Rio heard a faint, barely-there:</p><p> </p><p>“…Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>Like she’d only just caught on.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed down the pang in her chest. It wasn’t like words could hurt her anymore. Not from Jen. Not from anyone.</p><p> </p><p>But damn if that one didn’t land right where her heart should be.</p><p> </p><p>She needed to get off the phone.</p><p> </p><p>“Listen, Jen, I’ll be there. Just send my hotel info.” Her voice was light. Easy. No cracks. “If you haven’t booked me a room yet, I strongly suggest you do.”</p><p> </p><p>“I already sent it to your email.” A pause. “Tuesday, Rio. Events start Wednesday.”</p><p> </p><p>“Got it.” Rio grunted and hung up, gripping the counter of—closet? Bathroom? Whatever. She glanced at her reflection one last time, took a deep breath, and decided she needed to get out of this apartment like she originally planned.</p><p> </p><p>She opened the door and immediately heard movement coming from the other side of the apartment, opposite where she’d spent the past few minutes waking both herself and Kim up with that phone call.</p><p> </p><p>Following the sound, she rounded the corner of the hallway and spotted the other woman in the kitchen, reaching for a cup on the top shelf of the cupboard.</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched the hem of her shirt ride up over the curve of her—oh. No underwear.</p><p> </p><p>So maybe she could stay. Just this once.</p><p> </p><p>As quietly as her boots allowed, Rio stepped up behind her, easily reaching for the cup while placing a firm hand on her hip. She caught the sharp inhale, and the smirk stretched across her lips.</p><p> </p><p>The woman twisted in her hold, Rio’s hand now somewhere between her belly button and her chest, as she grinned up at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Changed your mind about staying?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let her smirk deepen, setting the cup down on the counter. Now free to use both hands, she wasted no time grabbing the other side of her waist, pulling her in. “I was considering it. If that’s okay with you, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Her lips traced a slow path down the woman’s neck, feeling arms loop around the back of her head. The soft sigh she earned made Rio’s smirk turn sharp against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>She only stopped when fingers threaded into her hair, tugging her away from the spot she’d been happily marking. The other woman reached behind her, grabbing something off the counter—a small business card—before pressing it into Rio’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced down and—yep. She was right. Her name does start with a K.</p><p> </p><p>Kate Bishop</p><p>Bishop Event Planning</p><p>NYC</p><p> </p><p>Flipping the card over, she took in the contact info and social media handles listed on the back.</p><p> </p><p>“I know we only talked about this for like thirty seconds before I took you home,” Kate said, “but I do need a new florist. Send me a message when you’re done with the wedding from hell, as you so eloquently put it. I’ve got some huge events coming up for the holiday season.”</p><p> </p><p>And of course Rio had mentioned her business while flirting. It was practically her go-to line. She’d argue it worked 99% of the time. The 1% it didn’t work on were the women she didn’t even bother talking to before their tongues were down her throat.</p><p> </p><p>She smiled. “Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>The moment was over.</p><p> </p><p>Back to the original plan—get out of here right now. Because now she was thinking about Evanora’s only daughter’s wedding again, and she really, really didn’t want to be thinking about that right now.</p><p> </p><p>Pulling back, Rio took her phone out of her pocket, snapped a quick photo of both sides of the card, then handed it back to Kate.</p><p> </p><p>Kate frowned, clearly confused. Before she could say anything, Rio beat her to it.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll lose the card,” she said simply, slipping her phone back into her pocket. “But I won’t delete the picture. You should hear from me in two weeks or so. That work?”</p><p> </p><p>Kate nodded, her smile creeping back onto her face.</p><p> </p><p>Good.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned, double-checking that she had everything. When she faced Kate again, though, the frown was back.</p><p> </p><p>Of course she thought Rio would stay.</p><p> </p><p>Once again, Rio stayed ahead of it. “I have to meet some other clients tomorrow at eight,” she said, moving toward the door. “So I need to go. But we’ll talk in two weeks, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Kate nodded again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked, leaned in, and pressed a kiss to her cheek before finally turning back toward the front door.</p><p> </p><p>She paused one last time, glancing over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Two weeks, Kate Bishop.”</p><p> </p><p>Then she was gone, stepping into the elevator, heading back down to the streets of New York.</p>

<p>Agatha’s wine glass sat empty in front of her for the third time tonight. She glared at it, as if sheer willpower could refill it.</p><p> </p><p>From an outsider’s perspective, she probably looked ridiculous.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced around the bar, finding the same faces she always did when she set foot in <em>The Witches’ Road</em>. Not that she was here often—maybe once every three months—but Westview was that small. With this being the only bar in town, there weren’t many options. For her or anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>A voice pulled her from her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, you could act like you want to be here.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up to find Alice, one of her best friends, slipping onto the barstool across from her at the booth Agatha had grabbed earlier for the circle of friends. She studied her for a second, already knowing Alice was just giving her a hard time. Because, truthfully, Agatha didn’t want to be here.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to be at home. With her son. Watching whatever movie he wanted, because it didn’t matter—she just wanted to spend time with him. But Wanda had finally settled into her apartment in Eastview, and she wanted Billy for the week. And unfortunately for Agatha, Billy wanted to stay with Wanda, too.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s just until Friday, Agatha. I’ll be back before you know it.”</p><p> </p><p>He’d barely finished the sentence before running out the front door, practically diving into the passenger seat of Wanda’s brand-new luxury SUV.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to slash its tires. But that could put her son’s safety at risk. Maybe she could just accidentally drag her mail key down the driver’s side doors. Or leave the sunroof open before a storm.</p><p> </p><p>She wouldn’t. She never would.</p><p> </p><p>Because as much as she couldn’t stand Wanda, Billy loved his other mom just as much.</p><p> </p><p>That didn’t change the fact that, for the last seventeen years, Agatha could count on one hand how many times Wanda had actually stuck to her word and shown up for their son. Every game she’d promised to be at? Something came up. Forget the milestones—first steps, first boyfriend. And Agatha could go on, probably for the rest of the night.</p><p> </p><p>But that wasn’t why she was here.</p><p> </p><p>She was at the only bar in Westview to distract herself from Wanda. Not dwell on her.</p><p> </p><p>She exhaled, focusing back on Alice, who had a beer in one hand and was now scanning the room.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled—probably more of a sad smile than she intended. “I’m sorry, Alice. You know how I feel about Wanda taking Billy this week.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice turned back to her, a glint in her eye now. The corners of her mouth turned up in a way that immediately put Agatha on edge.</p><p> </p><p>“Which is why we’re here.” Alice lifted her beer. “Now, let’s find you a distraction, shall we?”</p><p> </p><p>And then she was up again, already scouting the bar like she was on a mission.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and stood, placing a hand on Alice’s shoulder to gently push her back down. “Before you start playing matchmaker, I need another drink.” She gave Alice a pointed look. “Then we can find me a distraction.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice sighed dramatically but relented, settling back into her seat. “You know, you could let your distraction buy you a drink.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t dignify that with a response. They both knew she wouldn’t. She didn’t like the feeling of owing anyone something after.</p><p> </p><p>So, shaking her head, she made her way toward the bar, carefully stepping over the peanut shells littering the floor—because of course this place didn’t care about ruining her heels.</p><p> </p><p>The bar was packed, but she managed to find an open seat at the end. And, in her defense, it was the only open seat in the whole place. The alternative was sitting next to Herb, and while she liked him well enough, she really didn’t want to get stuck listening to a fifteen-minute monologue about basketball. Or maybe it was football. Either way, she didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>Pressing her glasses higher up the bridge of her nose, she waited for Vision to take her order.</p><p> </p><p>But before he reached her, someone slid into the stool beside her.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t look right away—didn’t want to make it obvious. Instead, she let her gaze drift slowly to the side, expecting another familiar face.</p><p> </p><p>But for the first time tonight, Agatha was surprised.</p><p> </p><p>The woman next to her wasn’t a neighbor. Not Steve, Tony, Natasha, or Yelena. Not even an acquaintance from Westview.</p><p> </p><p>No.</p><p> </p><p>This was someone <em>new</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Dark black hair fell just past her shoulders, and though she wasn’t fully facing Agatha, she could see hints of dark makeup dusted around her eyes.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Fuck</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>Okay. Maybe Agatha did need a distraction more than she thought.</p><p> </p><p>She let her gaze trail lower. A small tank top—tight, cropped—revealed tattooed arms, one decorated with a tarot card design. Her abs were defined just enough to catch the dim bar light.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>She was very, very thirsty.</p><p> </p><p>Tapping her nails against the wooden bar, she barely noticed as Vision finally approached, already reaching for the wine bottle he knew she was going to ask for. Some things never changed.</p><p> </p><p>“The usual?” he asked, glancing between her and the woman beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely spared her a glance—yet—as she nodded. Then, on impulse, she tipped her chin toward the stranger. “And whatever she’s having. On me.”</p><p> </p><p>So maybe Agatha didn’t take drinks from strangers. But she sure as hell would buy one.</p><p> </p><p>Especially for her.</p><p> </p><p>At that, the woman finally turned her head slightly, eyeing Agatha with an unreadable expression.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just smirked, tilting her head. “Consider it my way of saying welcome. You are new in town, right?”</p><p> </p><p>A pause. Then, the woman hummed. “Something like that.” The woman smiled, before ordering a whiskey from Vision.</p><p> </p><p>Something about the way she said it made Agatha pause. Her voice was smooth, self-assured—like someone who knew exactly what kind of effect she had on people.</p><p> </p><p>But more than that…</p><p> </p><p>There was something familiar about it.</p><p> </p><p>Like a song Agatha had heard before but couldn’t quite place.</p><p> </p><p>Vision set the drinks down in front of them before disappearing to help someone else.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha picked up her wine, swirling it slightly before glancing over again. The woman still hadn’t fully turned toward her, but she wasn’t ignoring her either.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked, taking a slow sip. “Westview doesn’t get many visitors. What brings you here?”</p><p> </p><p>This time, the woman did turn her head. She rested an elbow on the bar, whiskey glass dangling from her fingers as she studied Agatha. Then, just barely, she quirked an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt a small thrill at that.</p><p> </p><p>“Business,” the woman finally said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted a brow. “Mysterious.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman chuckled, shaking her head slightly as she took a sip of whiskey.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked. “You don’t look like the business type.”</p><p> </p><p>That made her laugh again—this time, just a little louder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure why she liked the sound of it so much.</p><p> </p><p>“And what type do I look like?” the woman asked, tilting her head slightly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her eyes drag over her again, slower this time. “Trouble.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman huffed out a quiet laugh, bringing her whiskey back to her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in slightly. “But I don’t mind a little trouble.”</p><p> </p><p>This time, the woman didn’t laugh. She just quirked that damn eyebrow again, something amused dancing in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>And for some reason, it was really starting to bug Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Not because she wasn’t responding. No, she was—just not the way Agatha expected. It wasn’t shyness, or even disinterest.</p><p> </p><p>It was something else.</p><p> </p><p>Like she was waiting for something.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>The woman smirked against the rim of her glass, shaking her head before taking another sip.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, suddenly feeling like she’d missed something important.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the silence hang between them for a moment, still feeling like she was missing something. But she shook it off, taking another sip of wine before tilting her head again.</p><p> </p><p>“So, what kind of business brings you to our little town?”</p><p> </p><p>The woman hummed, idly running a finger along the rim of her glass. “Work. I’m here for a wedding this weekend.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted slightly. “No kidding. I’m in a wedding this weekend.”</p><p> </p><p>That damn eyebrow quirked again. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said, shifting to face her a little more. “Bridesmaid to my dear friend Jen.” The words dear friend were clearly sarcastic, but fond underneath.</p><p> </p><p>The woman exhaled a quiet chuckle, nodding. “Small world.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked. “That it is. So, what are you? A wedding planner? Bartender? One of those people who follows the couple around and makes them cry with a video montage of their childhood?”</p><p> </p><p>At that, the woman finally turned to face her fully. “Florist.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, caught slightly off guard. She wasn’t sure what she had been expecting, but it definitely wasn’t that.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” she said, eyeing her again, taking in the tattoos, the confident way she carried herself. “You don’t look like the florist type either.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman smirked against the rim of her glass, taking another sip of whiskey. “And what type do I look like?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in slightly, smirking. “I already told you. Trouble.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman chuckled, shaking her head slightly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rested an elbow on the bar. “So, you’re the one in charge of making everything tastefully elegant and timeless, or whatever it is Jen’s fiancée keeps saying.” </p><p> </p><p>That made the woman grin. “Not a fan?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed. “Jen’s my friend. Ralph is… Ralph.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman quirked an eyebrow again, clearly waiting for more. But this time, Agatha chose to bite her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>The woman let out a small laugh. “Sounds like it’s going to be an interesting weekend.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “You have no idea.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t notice the way the woman was watching her, the way amusement danced in her eyes, like she knew exactly how interesting the weekend was about to get.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, tapping her fingers against her glass. “Oh, I think I do. Brides bring out the worst in people.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh, swirling the wine in her glass. “It’s not just Jen, though. It’s Ralph.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, feigning curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated, then exhaled. “Let’s just say that if Jen wasn’t one of my best friends, I would’ve made some excuse to get out of this whole thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, eyes flicking over Agatha’s face like she was cataloging every little reaction. “And yet, here you are. Committed and all.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, setting her glass down with a clink. “Unfortunately.”</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could respond, a familiar voice cut in from behind them.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you won’t believe what my sister said to me on the phone the other night—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely had time to process before Jen dropped her purse on the bar top beside her. But the moment the stranger turned her head—smirk firmly in place—Jen froze.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio</em>?”</p>

<p>Rio balanced a crate of roses against her hip, muttering a curse as she shoved the van door open with her foot. She had about five more trips before the roses were all packed, and the morning heat was already creeping in, making the back of her neck damp.</p><p> </p><p>God, does Rio hate weddings.</p><p> </p><p>Okay, hate is a strong word. She liked the flowers, liked the process of arranging them, but the wedding itself? Drama, expectations, brides with fragile egos who thought peonies could bloom year-round? No, thank you.</p><p> </p><p>So, after her third bridezilla in a row last January, Rio made an executive decision (it’s executive even if it’s just her at the shop) to never book weddings again. Was the money always good? Yes. Was it worth it? Maybe 2% of the time. If that.</p><p> </p><p>But step-mommy dearest had offered a contract worth four months’ rent for her shop and her apartment. And maybe florists really don’t make enough to turn that down. Whatever.</p><p> </p><p>Plus, with Kate’s offer on the table, being four months ahead in bills meant she could actually commit to the contract with Bishop Events without stressing about balancing the shop and the extra work.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled and turned back toward the shop. A stack of invoices sat on the counter next to her abandoned coffee. Probably from this morning. She grabbed the cup, took a sip— and, yep, that was definitely yesterday’s coffee. Good thing she drank it black. Less gross, right?</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed another crate, ready to head toward West View.</p><p> </p><p>The sooner she got there, the sooner she could start drinking.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Rio was moving just a little bit faster.</p><p>———</p><p>By the time she stepped into <em>The Witches’ Road</em>, the weight of the day had settled permanently at the back of her neck. Between loading a thousand roses, then unloading them again at the Kale property’s greenhouse, she had to remind herself at least eight times how much Evanora was paying her.</p><p> </p><p>Her sore neck also definitely had nothing to do with the fact that this was her first time back in West View in eight years.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe she’d get lucky, and no one would recognize her. Just grab a drink, then go back to her hotel to pass out.</p><p> </p><p>She took a few steps toward the bar, scanning for open seats. There were only two options— one next to a large man yelling about sports, and another beside a woman with an empty wine glass and dark hair falling to the middle of her back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body made the decision before she did. She was sliding onto the stool next to the woman before she even realized it. But by the time she was fully seated, listening to the woman place her order with the bartender, she really wished she had chosen the seat next to the guy. (<em>Ew</em>.)</p><p> </p><p>Because sitting next to Rio was <em>Agatha Harkness</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She recognized the voice immediately.</p><p> </p><p>And was kicking herself for not recognizing her sister’s friend earlier.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not like Jen, Agatha, and Alice weren’t glued to each other’s sides since Rio had moved into Evanora’s house with her father.</p><p> </p><p>And no, they never included her in anything— movie nights, sleepovers— but Rio had seen Agatha enough in passing that she should have recognized her. In Rio’s defense, though, the last time she saw Agatha was high school graduation.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio had changed a lot since high school.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, Agatha would have too.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a quick glance at her. She was wearing a crisp white button-down tucked into dark purple pants that— well, what was the word?</p><p> </p><p>Rio barely had time to land on one before she realized Agatha had just said something.</p><p> </p><p>“And whatever she’s having. On me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. Maybe a couple too many times because— wait.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What</strong>?</p><p> </p><p>She had to have misheard.</p><p> </p><p>Because there was no way Agatha— Agatha Harkness— was buying her a drink.</p><p> </p><p>Yet, the bartender was looking at her expectantly, waiting for her order. So Rio ordered. Then turned slightly toward Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her lips curling into a smirk. “Consider it my way of saying welcome. You are new in town, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took her time responding, letting the moment stretch just long enough for Agatha to shift in her chair. Not uncomfortable. Restless, maybe.</p><p> </p><p>Finally—</p><p> </p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio was pretty sure Agatha didn’t recognize her. Like<em> 99.9% sure.</em></p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha Harkness— Jen Kale’s best friend— would not be buying Rio a drink.</p><p> </p><p>Interesting.</p><p> </p><p>The bartender set a glass of whiskey in front of her, and Rio made an effort not to immediately down the entire thing. Instead, she wrapped her fingers around the glass, letting the cool condensation soak into her palm.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha not recognizing her was… unexpected.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had already mentioned it had been a long time. But West View wasn’t a city— people remembered each other here.</p><p> </p><p>Which meant one of two things: either Rio had changed a lot more than she thought, or Agatha wasn’t looking close enough.</p><p> </p><p>That second one? Yeah, Rio wasn’t buying it.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha was looking pretty close.</p><p> </p><p>She caught the way Agatha’s eyes dragged over her arms, lingering just long enough to clock the tattoos wrapped around her forearm. The way she’d glance at Rio’s mouth whenever she took a sip. And the way she leaned in, just slightly, when she called Rio trouble.</p><p> </p><p>If she didn’t know any better, she’d think Agatha was flirting with her.</p><p> </p><p>And, well.</p><p> </p><p>What could Rio say but— interesting.</p><p> </p><p>She fought the smirk tugging at her lips, choosing instead to swirl the whiskey in her glass.</p><p> </p><p>“So, what kind of business brings you to our little town?” Agatha asked, voice laced with something almost teasing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled a quiet chuckle, dragging a finger along the rim of her glass. “Work. I’m here for a wedding this weekend.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted slightly. “No kidding. I’m in a wedding this weekend.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, feigning mild surprise— because of course Agatha was in the wedding. She had to be a bridesmaid. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted, turning a little more toward her. “Bridesmaid to my dear friend Jen.” The sarcasm in dear friend was unmistakable.</p><p> </p><p>A bell went off in Rio’s head.</p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, she remembered exactly where she was.</p><p> </p><p>Sitting next to Agatha Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>Who was flirting with her.</p><p> </p><p>And now? Rio knew exactly how this was going to go.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was going to figure it out. She was going to connect the dots, maybe even remember all the times she, Jen, and Alice had conveniently forgotten to invite Rio to things.</p><p> </p><p>And then? The flirting would stop.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha Harkness wouldn’t flirt with Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Except— right now? She was.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe Rio liked to watch the world burn.</p><p> </p><p>So she let herself enjoy it for just a second longer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked. “So, what are you? A wedding planner? Bartender? One of those people who follows the couple around and makes them cry with a video montage of their childhood?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorted, finally turning fully to face her. “Florist.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, clearly caught off guard. “Huh.” Her gaze flickered over Rio again, slower this time, like she was reevaluating everything she thought she knew. “You don’t look like the florist type either.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her whiskey to her lips. “And what type do I look like?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in just a fraction, smirk deepening. “I already told you. Trouble.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head slightly.</p><p> </p><p>That was fair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took another sip of her wine. “So, you’re the one in charge of making everything tastefully elegant and timeless, or whatever it is Jen’s fiancée keeps saying.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Not a fan?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed. “Jen’s my friend. Ralph is… Ralph.”</p><p> </p><p>That was enough of an answer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just nodded, taking another sip of whiskey.</p><p> </p><p>And then—</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you won’t believe what my sister said to me on the phone the other night—”</p><p> </p><p>Rio knew that voice instantly.</p><p> </p><p>She turned just as Jen slid up behind her, still mid-rant.</p><p> </p><p>And the second Jen saw her—</p><p> </p><p>She froze.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio smirked right back.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio</em>?”</p>

<p>“Hey, sis,” Agatha heard Rio say.</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s cheeks burned so hot she wouldn’t be surprised if Jen or Rio—hey, did Agatha mention this was <strong>Rio</strong>, Jen’s stepsister she’d been shamelessly flirting with for the last fifteen minutes?—could feel the heat radiating off her.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s stepsister. Her best friend’s sister.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt herself blink as Rio’s smirk deepened, her attention fully on Jen. As if this wasn’t a monumental moment. As if Agatha hadn’t just spent the last fifteen minutes eyeing Rio like she was something decadent and worth ruining a diet over.</p><p> </p><p>How the hell did she miss this?</p><p> </p><p>Okay, sure, the tattoos were new. But that wasn’t it. No, Rio carried herself differently than she had when they were kids. Agatha remembers only ever seeing her with her head ducked, shoulders curled inward, like she was trying to take up as little space as possible. And yeah, maybe she never got close enough to see what the slope of her nose looked like before, or to notice the tiny gap in her teeth. But she could see all of it now.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha liked what she saw.</p><p> </p><p>Hey? Remember? <em>Jen’s sister</em>.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio turned back to her, meeting Agatha’s gaze like she’d known the whole time. Like she’d wanted her to figure it out. “Good to see you again, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Then she threw back the rest of her drink, tipping her head, exposing the long line of her throat. Maybe it was the wine, but Agatha absolutely did watch the way a drop of whiskey missed her lips, rolling slowly down the curve of her chin before disappearing into the hollow of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>No, no. She needed a distraction. She’d said she needed a distraction. Just—not with Jen’s sister.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rio</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>Alice made her presence known by throwing an arm around both her and Jen, yanking her fully back into reality.</p><p> </p><p>And it was a <em>relief</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio was still watching her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha two minutes ago would have loved the unwavering eye contact.</p><p> </p><p>But now? Her breath felt sharp. Her skin hot. Too hot.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit, you look different,” Alice said, blinking in recognition. Of course Alice figured it out immediately.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, Rio broke eye contact. Or maybe Agatha did first. It didn’t matter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk was still there, etched into her lips like it had all the time in the world.</p><p> </p><p>“And you look exactly the same.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice grinned, unfazed. “That’s a compliment if I’ve ever heard one.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, was busy retracing every single step she’d taken tonight. Was she really that into women that she hadn’t recognized Rio? She wasn’t oblivious. She knew when someone was flirting back.</p><p> </p><p>Right?</p><p> </p><p>Or had Rio been playing with her?</p><p> </p><p><em>Maybe</em>.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha had a feeling—one she couldn’t quite place but didn’t need proof of.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was at least into women.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha was hot.</p><p> </p><p>At least, that’s what Alice and Jen had said earlier when she sent them a picture of her outfit before coming to the bar.</p><p> </p><p>And dammit, Agatha was into this. The way Rio was looking at her. The low pull in her stomach when she thought about how Rio was the one she’d been flirting with.</p><p> </p><p>“How was your drive?” Jen asked her sister, cutting through the static in Agatha’s brain.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk stretched into something more amused. “We don’t need to do this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched as Jen’s mouth turned into a straight, unimpressed line.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine. I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, reaching back for her jacket.</p><p> </p><p>Wait. When the hell did Rio have a jacket? Had she ever had a jacket on around Agatha?</p><p> </p><p>“See you tomorrow at one,” Rio said, back still turned, her voice curling with mischief.</p><p> </p><p>Alice’s barely audible <em>oh, shit</em> was the only warning before Jen’s entire body stiffened.</p><p> </p><p>Because everyone had an itinerary. Every minute of every day leading up to the wedding was planned.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, as a bridesmaid, had it memorized. Mostly so Jen wouldn’t make her memorize it.</p><p> </p><p>And one? One was not the time they needed to be at the club.</p><p> </p><p>“Ten, Rio. Ten A.M. at the golf club. For brunch.” Jen’s voice was teetering on exasperated. “Rio, please tell me you’re not serious.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned back, the smirk that had been playing at the edges of her lips now fully formed.</p><p> </p><p>And if Agatha or Alice had a single ounce of self-preservation, they would have pulled Jen away before she strangled her sister in the middle of <em>The Witches’ Road</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio was relishing this.</p><p> </p><p>She always knew exactly how to get under Jen’s skin. Knew which buttons to push, how to slip just under her composure like it was nothing. And every time? She got a reaction. Every. Time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was relentless.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha wondered if that translated into other aspects of her life.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s sister, Agatha reminded herself sharply, even as something low and warm curled in her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>What the hell was happening to her?</p><p> </p><p>Oh, right, she needed a distraction.</p><p> </p><p>Jen exhaled, long and slow. “Just be there, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio held up her hands in mock surrender. “You got it.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, just as she was about to press the door handle, she paused. Turned back.</p><p> </p><p>And her eyes found Agatha again.</p><p> </p><p>Was Agatha watching her leave?</p><p> </p><p><em>Oops</em>.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t seem to mind. Didn’t even smirk this time.</p><p> </p><p>She just lifted a brow, slow and deliberate.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha looked away first.</p><p> </p><p>Rio won that one.</p><p> </p><p>She exhaled sharply as Jen ordered a drink from Vision, finally giving Agatha a second to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>But Alice—dammit, Alice—was grinning at her, eyebrows raised like she was dying to say something. Because of course Alice had been watching. Of course Alice knew Agatha had spent fifteen minutes eye-fucking Rio without realizing who she was.</p><p> </p><p>And of course Alice opened her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” she said, voice dripping with amusement. “Did you find a distraction?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even hesitate. She reached out and snatched Alice’s drink straight from her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p> </p><p>Her cheeks were burning again.</p><p> </p><p>And it wasn’t from the alcohol.</p><p> </p><p>“What distraction?” Jen asked, finally paying attention now that she had her drink.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just shook her head, ignoring the smirk Alice was trying—and failing—to hide.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” she muttered. “Let’s just go back to the table.”</p>

<p>Rio let the hotel room door swing shut behind her, the lock clicking into place.</p><p> </p><p>She exhaled, slow. Threw her bag down on the desk chair. Did a quick scan around the room—one bed, lamps, a desk, and the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>She went straight for it, leaning over the sink with both hands before looking into her reflection.</p><p> </p><p>What the fuck was that?</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed a washcloth off the towel bar, turning the sink on as hot as it could go. Normally, she didn’t even bother wiping off her makeup, but she needed to do something before she thought about her again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s best friend.</p><p> </p><p>Never had Agatha passed her mind so much since she’d known the girl. She never needed to think about her. Because Agatha was Jen’s friend—and Rio wasn’t invited to hang with them. What Rio remembered about Agatha was that she was loud. A little dramatic. Always in the middle of things.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio wasn’t in things.</p><p> </p><p>But then Agatha was buying her a drink. And Rio let her.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio got to look at Agatha. More than just ships in the night, passing each other in her stepmom’s house when Agatha would sleep over. More than a quick peek in her direction when she, Alice, and Jen would scramble out the front door before Evanora noticed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t just look at her—she saw her.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice. That little half-smirk that tugged at her lips whenever Rio said something she wasn’t sure she should react to. The way her round glasses slid down her nose after a sip of her drink, and how she barely seemed to notice, pushing them back up with the tip of her knuckle like it was muscle memory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio noticed.</p><p> </p><p>Had she mentioned her nose?</p><p> </p><p>Her nose.</p><p> </p><p>Rio splashed water on her face with both hands. More than she needed. Making a mess. Okay, so there was a puddle on the floor. Whatever.</p><p> </p><p>This was stupid.</p><p> </p><p>Rio did not do this.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t like Rio hadn’t flirted before. Didn’t this story start with her in another woman’s bed? It wasn’t like she hadn’t walked into bars, found someone interesting, and spent the night chasing a flicker of fun.</p><p> </p><p>And yet. Here she was.</p><p> </p><p>Standing in her hotel bathroom, staring at her dripping reflection, feeling—what?</p><p> </p><p>Off.</p><p> </p><p>Like off-balance.</p><p> </p><p>Like something shifted.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio had recognized her. Maybe not before she sat down, but almost right away.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha hadn’t recognized her.</p><p> </p><p>And that was fun.</p><p> </p><p>The way she reacted to Rio’s comments. The interest in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>But then Jen walked up. And Rio was saying, hey, sis, and suddenly, it was like the spell broke—Agatha’s eyes snapping to hers with a different look than before.</p><p> </p><p>Like she wasn’t sure if she wanted to take a step back or forward.</p><p> </p><p>And that was what Rio couldn’t stop thinking about.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t do this. She didn’t pull apart every stupid little detail of a conversation with another woman.</p><p> </p><p>The way Agatha blinked at her, like she had short-circuited.</p><p> </p><p>It was adorable. Hey, what?</p><p> </p><p>Or the way her throat bobbed when she swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>The way she looked away first.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t matter. It did not.</p><p> </p><p>She was here for Jen’s wedding. Nothing more.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was just—</p><p> </p><p>She was just Jen’s best friend.</p><p> </p><p>That’s all.</p><p> </p><p>————-</p><p> </p><p>Has Rio mentioned she’s not a morning person?</p><p> </p><p>She really wasn’t a morning person if she had gotten more than four hours of sleep and hadn’t spent the first ten minutes of her morning lying in bed, staring at the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>Thinking about Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She groaned, scrubbing a hand down her face.</p><p> </p><p>She needed to focus on something else.</p><p> </p><p>She shuffled towards her duffel bag and found something that didn’t scream I just rolled out of bed for this brunch.</p><p> </p><p>The shower helped. Coffee—even out of the hotel coffee pot—helped more. By the time her boots were on and she was grabbing her bag, she felt almost like a human again.</p><p> </p><p>Almost.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha’s small laugh was still in the back of her head, like a song she couldn’t get unstuck.</p><p> </p><p>And before she knew it, she was stepping through the ginormous doors of the golf club and walking towards the dining room.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio could do this. Sit in a corner, push through whoever she was sat next to, until this was over and she could go back to the hotel.</p><p> </p><p>But then there was a kid in the corner she chose for herself.</p><p> </p><p>Kicking the leg of the chair next to him. Arms crossed so tight he looked stiff with it.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio doesn’t care. Or she normally doesn’t. Because she’s not good with kids, and she definitely doesn’t go out of her way to talk to them.</p><p> </p><p>But this one?</p><p> </p><p>He was muttering under his breath like he was personally plotting someone’s downfall.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio could respect that.</p><p> </p><p>She slowed her approach, glancing around. The rest of the party was still either getting in or scattered around—Jen at the bar, Alice talking to some guests at the front, Evanora sitting at the bride’s table, and Agatha—</p><p> </p><p>Nowhere to be found.</p><p> </p><p>She looked back down. The kid glared at her.</p><p> </p><p>Glared.</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You good?”</p><p> </p><p>He huffed. “No.”</p><p> </p><p>“Solid answer.”</p><p> </p><p>Another glare. Rio felt herself smirk. Just a little bit.</p><p> </p><p>And then the kid sighed, dragging a hand down his face. “Jen said I can’t wear makeup.”</p><p> </p><p>Okay. To be honest, Rio was not expecting that.</p><p> </p><p>But she rolled with it. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“She said I have to look ‘natural.’” He said it like the word hurt him. “But I’m pretty sure her mom is behind it. She wants the pictures to have a certain look.”</p><p> </p><p>And, dammit, that sounded like Evanora. Jen probably didn’t care at all if this kid wore makeup. Wedding pictures or not.</p><p> </p><p>But Evanora had written stupid rules into her contract with Rio this weekend—she wouldn’t put it past her to do this too.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio looked at the kid again. And he looked… sad.</p><p> </p><p>Like one of those puppy commercials. You know, the one where the puppy looks all pathetic and—never mind.</p><p> </p><p>Rio likes to watch the world burn. Especially Evanora’s.</p><p> </p><p>She lowered her voice. “Do you want to fix that?”</p><p> </p><p>The kid’s—no, teen’s—eyes snapped up to hers, wide and cautious and hopeful.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was already walking toward the hallway. “C’mon then.”</p><p> </p><p>The teen shot up out of his chair, with more energy than Rio had seen from him all morning, and followed her out of the dining room.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t have much in her bag, but she had some eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick. She handed them over, and he ran into the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>So Rio waited, leaning against the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>And then she heard it—the chatter of the dining room again.</p><p> </p><p>And a voice, louder than the rest.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you seen Billy? Pictures are about to start.”</p><p> </p><p>And oh. No.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>That was Agatha’s voice. And it was coming closer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shut her eyes. Hung her head.</p><p> </p><p>The click of heels against the tile. Coming straight for her.</p><p> </p><p>She opened her eyes just in time.</p><p> </p><p>And there she was.</p><p> </p><p>A cream-colored wrap dress that cinched at the waist, falling just below her knee. And of course, it had a floral print. Her hair in loose waves, framing her face and falling over her glasses.</p><p> </p><p>But she wasn’t looking at Rio. She was scanning the hall, looking for Billy.</p><p> </p><p>Then—she saw Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>Then she was walking faster.</p><p> </p><p>And then she was right in front of her, a little flushed, half out of breath, and looking fantastic.</p><p> </p><p>Rio licked her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio—hey, I was hoping we could talk. But I’m actually looking for—”</p><p> </p><p>The bathroom door swung open, and Billy - Rio assumed - stepped out, grinning like he just won the lottery. He caught his reflection in the glossy hallway mirror, tilting his head side to side, admiring himself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breath—half relieved, half exasperated. “Billy—”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I know. Pictures.” He rolled his eyes, but his smirk stayed in place. “I’m coming.” He handed Rio back her makeup. </p><p> </p><p>She blinked at him, her gaze narrowing slightly. “What—what’s on your face?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy lifted his chin, looking downright smug. “Eyeliner. Little mascara. Lip gloss. Looks good, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then closed it, glancing at Rio before looking back at her son. “I thought—Jen said—”</p><p> </p><p>Billy huffed, crossing his arms. “Jen said no makeup. But then Rio—” He gestured dramatically toward her, like she was some kind of legend. “—had some in her bag, and she let me use it. Which was so cool, by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped back to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just raised an eyebrow, completely unapologetic. “Kid wanted makeup. I had makeup.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy grinned wider. “See? Cool.” He turned to Agatha, bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet. “It just—it makes me feel more like myself, you know?” His voice softened a little. “And I wanna feel like me in the pictures.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face shifted, something tender in the way she looked at him now.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sweetheart,” she murmured, reaching up to adjust his collar, smoothing it over his shoulder. “If this makes you happy, I don’t care what anyone else says.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy beamed, then shot Rio a triumphant look like See? before heading toward the dining room.</p><p> </p><p>And then it was just Agatha and Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled, pressing her fingers lightly to her temple before letting her hand drop.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked. “You’re welcome, by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, her lips twitching at the corners. “You just met him, and you’re already encouraging him to break rules?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged. “He was pissed. I had the means to fix it. Why not?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha studied her for a beat, then sighed, adjusting her glasses. “Well… thank you. Really.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching her. “See? That wasn’t so hard.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t argue. Instead, she glanced toward the dining room, her expression shifting. “I should—”</p><p> </p><p>“Go, yeah. Wedding stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>She hesitated, then nodded before turning to follow Billy. But before she disappeared into the dining room, she paused and glanced back.</p><p> </p><p>“Seriously, though,” she said, a little softer. “That was… really kind of you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt something warm settle in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>And then Agatha was gone.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio—well.</p><p> </p><p>She ran her tongue over her teeth, watching her go.</p>

<p>The walk home from the bar was quiet. <em>Too</em> quiet. </p><p> </p><p>The kind of quiet that made her thoughts loud, pressing in on her, winding around her ribs, making it impossible to ignore the way her body still buzzed.</p><p> </p><p>She hated that.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a sharp breath as she unlocked her front door, stepping inside. Normally, Billy would be here—sprawled across the couch, his Switch in his hands, half-watching TV, asking her what was for dinner. But he was at Wanda’s.</p><p> </p><p>And she was alone.</p><p> </p><p>No distraction.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio was supposed to be the distraction—before Rio was, well, <em>Rio</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She tossed her purse onto the counter, kicked off her shoes, and didn’t bother turning on the lights.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the drinks from tonight but not like she did two hours ago. Two hours ago Agatha was happily flirting with Rio and then she wasn’t. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Okay. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Straight to the bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>Straight to bed.</p><p> </p><p>But the second her head hit the pillow, she groaned, dragging her hands down her face.</p><p> </p><p>Because now there was nothing left to do but think.</p><p> </p><p>And all she could think about was her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s stepsister.</p><p> </p><p>The girl who never came back after high school, never showed up for family gatherings, never seemed to give a damn about anything.</p><p> </p><p>And fuck it, this new Rio had Agatha hooked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had been devastatingly confident—smirking like she knew something Agatha didn’t, shoulders loose, eyes dark, voice slow and steady like she had all the time in the world.</p><p> </p><p>And then there were the tattoos.</p><p> </p><p>The ones stretching down her arms, peeking out from under the hem of her shirt, teasing at something along her ribs—something Agatha wanted to trace—</p><p> </p><p>She let out a sharp breath, pressing the heels of her palms against her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p> </p><p>She was getting this out of her system.</p><p> </p><p>Right now.</p><p> </p><p>Because come morning, she wouldn’t be thinking about Rio Vidal anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha half slid, half army crawled across her bed towards her pillows. </p><p> </p><p>Sleep would help. Sleep would help her get over it. </p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Except morning came.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe</p><p> </p><p> - <em>maybe</em> - </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had a dream about a faceless tattooed woman last night. Perhaps, some would call it a dirty dream. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t think so, because the woman that went down on her for so long she begged her to stop didn’t have a face. So it couldn’t have been Rio. So, in theory, it doesn’t count. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha could follow that logic. </p><p> </p><p>She heard herself groan before she realized she was even making a sound. </p><p> </p><p>She should’ve found a different distraction last night. </p><p> </p><p>She felt herself pushing to get her eyes open. </p><p> </p><p>The first thing she saw was the soft light filtering through the window.</p><p> </p><p>The second was the ceiling fan, spinning too slow, too steady, too mocking.</p><p> </p><p>She exhaled sharply, dragging herself out of bed.</p><p> </p><p>She felt like she was a teenager. </p><p> </p><p>So no, this wasn’t happening.</p><p> </p><p>This was <em>nothing</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was leaving after the wedding. She didn’t care about anything—not Westview, not the people in it, not Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>So whatever the hell last night was?</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t real.</p><p> </p><p>Just a reaction. A moment. A mistake.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha?</p><p> </p><p>She was great at mistakes.</p><p> </p><p>Even better at fixing them.</p><p> </p><p>She was going to get through this brunch, survive the rest of the weekend, and move on.</p><p> </p><p>That was the plan.</p><p> </p><p>And it was working.</p><p> </p><p>If she said it enough to herself, surely she’d believe it, right?</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>And it was working. </p><p> </p><p>Right up until she saw her again. </p><p> </p><p>Because before she could even think to stop herself, she heard herself saying “Rio—hey, I was hoping we could talk. But I’m actually looking for—”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up from where she leaned against the hallway wall, expression unreadable.</p><p> </p><p>Then she turned, and—</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p> </p><p>Because shit.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was wearing <em>that</em>. </p><p> </p><p>One could describe it as simply a button up shirt and pants. But no - it looked better than that description. </p><p> </p><p>And she wore it like she wore everything—like she barely had to try, like she just <em>was</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The fabric was tailored in that effortless way, sleeves pushed up to her elbows, no tie, collar open just enough to be distracting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced herself to focus.</p><p> </p><p>She cleared her throat, brushing past Rio to glance towards the bathroom—</p><p> </p><p>And there he was.</p><p> </p><p>“Billy.” She heard herself say. </p><p> </p><p>Beaming like he just got the world’s best birthday present.</p><p> </p><p>He stepped out, tilting his chin up, admiring himself in the hallway mirror.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. “What—” She squinted. “What’s on your face?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy smirked. “Eyeliner. Bit of mascara. Lip gloss.” He turned his head slightly, examining the way the light hit his features. “Looks good, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then closed it, then looked at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, who was holding a tube of lip gloss in her hand like it was nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Billy turned back to the mirror, nodding to himself. “Jen said I couldn’t wear any. But then Rio—” He gestured toward her dramatically. “—had some in her bag. And let me use it. Which was, like, the coolest thing ever.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just raised an eyebrow. “Kid wanted makeup. I had makeup.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy grinned. “See? Cool.” He paused, suddenly more serious. “It just makes me feel more like me, you know? And I wanna feel like me in the pictures.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s expression shifted.</p><p> </p><p>Something warm pressed at her chest.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Agatha was pushing Billy towards the dining room for photos, she realized two things.</p><p> </p><p>One: her previous idea of not engaging with Rio was going exactly how she thought it would. Not going. </p><p> </p><p>Two: Rio cared. At least a little bit. </p><p> </p><p>Even if it was just about her kid being upset. Or maybe, maybe Rio cared about pissing off Evanora. But someone who didn’t care, didn’t stand outside a men’s bathroom waiting for her makeup back from a teenager. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew Billy was upset about the no-makeup rule since Jen first mentioned it to him, but he didn’t make a big deal out of it. Because right afterwards, Jen was spilling her guts to both of them that this wedding was not just hers and Ralph’s - no - it was also Evanora’s. </p><p> </p><p>Her money meant her vision and her rules. </p><p> </p><p>And so Billy bit his tongue. And Agatha watched him. </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t liked it, but she didn’t fight it either. </p><p> </p><p>Because that was Evanora. And Jen knew to always follow her word. And Agatha was Jen’s bridesmaid.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio?</p><p> </p><p>Rio just handed Billy the damn lip gloss. No hesitation. No worry about fallout. Just a quiet, simple act.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what to do with that.</p><p> </p><p>And by the time they were lining up for photos, she realized something else.</p><p> </p><p>She was still thinking about it.</p><p> </p><p>About her.</p><p> </p><p>She almost didn’t hear Evanora speaking—wouldn’t have, if Billy’s shoulders under her hands hadn’t suddenly tensed.</p><p> </p><p>“What did I say about makeup?”</p><p> </p><p>The dining room fell into silence.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could even formulate a response, Jen stepped between them and Evanora.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s just some eyeliner and lip gloss. It’s not a big deal,” Jen shot back.</p><p> </p><p>From over Jen’s shoulder, Agatha saw Evanora’s mouth press into a thin line.</p><p> </p><p>“I told him no makeup,” Evanora said, voice tight.</p><p> </p><p>“And I said it was fine. Can we take the photos now? I’m starving.” Jen didn’t wait for a response. She turned on her heel, already facing the photographer, without so much as a glance back at Billy or Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched as Jen squared her shoulders and took a measured breath, keeping her composure better than most would after standing up to Evanora.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure she’d ever seen Jen snap back so quickly. Or so confidently. But Jen had always had Billy’s back—maybe because he was Agatha’s, and Jen had always had Agatha’s back, too. Jen was loyal to a fault when it came to her and Alice.</p><p> </p><p>The photographer gestured for Agatha to stand beside Jen for the first photo.</p><p> </p><p>And for the next thirty minutes, Agatha absolutely did not spend her time thinking about Rio while smiling until her cheeks went numb.</p><p> </p><p>Bridesmaids together. Then Billy with Jen. Then Billy, Jen, and Agatha. Then a series of other shots before they were called up again.</p><p> </p><p>If this was just the brunch photos, Agatha wasn’t sure how she was going to survive the rest of the week.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, it was just Jen, and the photographer asked if she wanted any last photos before wrapping up.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t hesitate.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you missed an important one.”</p><p> </p><p>The photographer looked at Jen like she’d just grown another head.</p><p> </p><p>Jen jerked her chin toward the back of the room—where Rio was standing, leaning against a column. Not that Agatha had noticed.</p><p> </p><p>“I need one with my sister.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced up. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“You heard me.” Jen motioned for her to come forward.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time since Agatha had seen her at the bar, Rio hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>But she walked forward anyway. And as she took her place beside Jen, Jen leaned down to whisper something Agatha definitely did not try to hear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up at Jen, smirking. But not her usual cocky smirk. This one was different—small, like she was holding back a laugh.</p><p> </p><p>The photographer signaled.</p><p> </p><p>Three.</p><p> </p><p>Jen and Rio turned their heads toward the camera.</p><p> </p><p>Two.</p><p> </p><p>The photographer adjusted the lens.</p><p> </p><p>One.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled.</p><p> </p><p>Not a smirk. Not a knowing grin.</p><p> </p><p>A real smile. Soft. Small.</p><p> </p><p>And the camera clicked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked and turned away—only to find Alice standing in front of her, smirking.</p><p> </p><p>Alice glanced between Agatha and the pair getting photographed, her smirk widening.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply and while she’s sure Billy has heard worse, covered his ears with both hands. “Shut the fuck up.”</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>Despite this brunch and the other night at the bar, Agatha didn’t really drink. She didn’t have the time—not between the shop and being a mom.</p><p> </p><p>But it was Jen’s wedding. And right now, she was immensely grateful for the crisp mimosa in her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“To Jen pissing off Evanora,” Agatha said, clinking her glass against Alice’s.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m ignoring that,” Jen muttered, though she took a sip of her own drink.</p><p> </p><p>The three of them were tucked into a table near the edge of the dining hall, just far enough from Evanora. And while Agatha could still feel the woman’s presence looming over the event, she ignored it.</p><p> </p><p>Because right now, she was tipsy, laughing with her best friends like they were kids again. And between the sleepless night of Billy being away and Rio occupying far too much space in her thoughts, she needed this.</p><p> </p><p>Alice snickering beside her, Jen’s low laugh—Agatha could finally breathe again.</p><p> </p><p>And then Ralph showed up.</p><p> </p><p>He strolled in like he owned the place, suit fitting almost too well, exuding nothing but smugness. Agatha had to breathe through her mouth so she didn’t choke on his cologne.</p><p> </p><p>Jen sat up a little straighter, and just like that, the buzz from this morning disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>“Ladies,” Ralph greeted smoothly, flashing his practiced smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha offered a tight-lipped smile. Alice grunted.</p><p> </p><p>Ralph either didn’t notice or didn’t care. He rested a hand a little too firmly on the back of Jen’s chair. “Evanora wants to talk about the reception seating chart. Apparently, some last-minute changes need approval.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced toward the center of the room. Sure enough, Evanora was watching.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right,” Jen said, plastering on a bright, agreeable smile. She stood, turning back toward them. “Don’t drink all the champagne before I get back.”</p><p> </p><p>“No promises,” Alice said before Agatha could.</p><p> </p><p>Jen grinned, looping her arm through Ralph’s as he led her across the room.</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, it was just the two of them.</p><p> </p><p>Alice turned to Agatha, stirring her drink with the tip of her straw. “So,” she said casually. “Wanna talk about it?”</p><p> </p><p>Of course Alice would pounce the second they were alone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been doing so well at not engaging.</p><p> </p><p>“Talk about what?” she said, feigning innocence.</p><p> </p><p>Alice arched an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a sip of her drink. “You need to be more specific.”</p><p> </p><p>“You know exactly what I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope.” Agatha shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>Alice hummed. Agatha took another sip.</p><p> </p><p>Alice’s smirk widened.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Alice said finally. “Your crush on Jen’s stepsister.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha choked. Alice beamed.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not—” Agatha rasped.</p><p> </p><p>Alice tilted her head, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scowled. “I don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmhm.” Alice took a slow sip of her drink.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha set her glass down. Maybe forcefully. “I don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I believe you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. Alice just grinned wider.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, fingers drumming against the table. “Even if I were thinking about Rio that way—which I don’t—it wouldn’t matter.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice leaned forward. “Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because she’s Jen’s stepsister.”</p><p> </p><p>“And?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because she’s leaving after the wedding.”</p><p> </p><p>“And?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because she doesn’t care about anything.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice hummed, nodding—but she was now looking past Agatha’s left shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took another sip.</p><p> </p><p>Alice kept nodding, gaze fixed on whatever was behind her.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha followed it.</p><p> </p><p>Across the room, Billy sat at a table with Rio, leaning forward slightly as she gestured toward the floral centerpiece between them.</p><p> </p><p>His brow furrowed, lips parted slightly, eyes locked onto hers.</p><p> </p><p>Because Billy didn’t do this. He didn’t pay attention to people outside their immediate circle—not easily, not willingly. Jen and Alice were exceptions. Lilia, too. And even then, it had taken time for him to open up.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, there he was. Listening.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio—</p><p> </p><p>Rio was pointing at a flower, tracing the outline of a petal with her fingertip. Billy nodded, hanging onto every word.</p><p> </p><p>“That,” Alice said softly, “doesn’t look like someone who doesn’t care.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond.</p><p> </p><p>Because Billy tilted his head, asking something.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio nodded.</p><p> </p><p>And Billy smiled.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in a long time, he wasn’t just present.</p><p> </p><p>He was <strong>engaged</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>No matter how hard Agatha was trying not to be.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>Rio didn’t get nervous. Not really. Not ever. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t let herself. </p><p> </p><p>And yet, standing next to Jen with her arm around her shoulders, she could feel something sharp and uncertain cutting through her usual confidence. </p><p> </p><p>The whole thing had been unexpected. She had been perfectly fine in the corner, thank you. </p><p> </p><p>It was entertaining watching the never-ending stream of photos play out in front of her. Everyone’s attentiveness towards the photographer dwindled more and more each time he clicked the shutter button. </p><p> </p><p>She definitely didn’t watch the kid and Agatha standing at the side - her hands on his shoulders, hanging onto every word he said as they waited for their turn. Their closeness was charming. Almost as if - </p><p> </p><p>But then Jen was turning towards Rio, and she heard the words, “I need one with my sister.” </p><p> </p><p>And Jen had said it like it was the simplest thing in the world. </p><p> </p><p>As if Evanora hadn’t specifically told Rio to stay out of the way unless she was called to help. Hell, Rio wasn’t even needed at the brunch, but Jen had put it on her schedule. And her contract said to follow the schedule. </p><p> </p><p>So she walked forward. Because Jen had asked for her. </p><p> </p><p>And then it was just the two of them in front of the camera, and Jen was leaning down, murmuring at best, “You don’t know who gave the kid makeup do you?” </p><p> </p><p>And Rio had to bite back a laugh. Because she saw Jen stick up for the kid to Evanora. She didn’t think Jen would put the pieces together. She normally doesn’t. “No idea.” </p><p> </p><p>And then the photographer was counting down. </p><p> </p><p>Rio and Jen both turned towards the photographer and Rio felt herself smile. </p><p> </p><p>Click. </p><p> </p><p>Then it was over. </p><p> </p><p>And Evanora was directing everyone back to their seats, and Jen was pulled to the side and Rio was at the back of the crowd. </p><p> </p><p>So she waited until everyone had found their seats, definitely not keeping an eye on where someone specific was sitting.</p><p> </p><p>And she definitely didn’t choose a table by herself specifically on the other side of the room from that specific person. </p><p> </p><p>Just when she had settled back into her seat, she felt the table shift and someone sliding into the seat next to her. </p><p> </p><p>Billy. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turned towards him, watching as he scooted his chair closer, arms crossed over his chest. He was looking at her like he was trying to solve a puzzle, or she was the puzzle. </p><p> </p><p>“So.” He said after a long moment. </p><p> </p><p>Rio raised her eyebrow at him, saying nothing. </p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, “At brunch?” </p><p> </p><p>“At the wedding,” he clarified. “I’ve never met you before, and yet my Aunt Jen is asking for a photo with you,” he drew out. “Her sister.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, “I’m the florist.” </p><p> </p><p>“Jen’s sister.” </p><p> </p><p>Well. </p><p> </p><p>He’s not going to drop this. Rio was already way past her limits of feeling off today. She wasn’t going to be explaining her relationship to Agatha’s son. </p><p> </p><p>Rio hasn’t even let herself address that - because she’s pretty sure Billy is a teenager. And if Rio counted the years she’s been gone from Westview - nope that hasn’t changed in the last 48 hours - that’s still only eight years. </p><p> </p><p>Rio would’ve remembered if Agatha had been pregnant. Because they would’ve been kids. </p><p> </p><p>Billy was still looking at her, looking for any kind of clue. </p><p> </p><p>So no - Rio was not addressing the sister comment, the Aunt Jen comment, or the fact that Billy is probably Agatha’s son, somehow. Not that it’s Rio’s business. </p><p> </p><p>“You go to Westview High, right?” she asked. That seemed to do it, as it looked like Billy was thrown off by the sudden shift in topic. </p><p> </p><p>“.. Yeah?” </p><p> </p><p>“Mrs. Hart still teaching English?” </p><p> </p><p>That got a groan out of him, Rio smirked. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s Mrs. Davis now.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio gave herself a pat on the back, because everyone dreaded her class. She was the nicest lady until she was grading your assignments. But Rio always could get through to her, because one day she found out Mrs. Hart loved to garden. </p><p> </p><p>So maybe Rio used her plant knowledge during high school to get on the teacher’s good side. At least that time, she wasn’t using it as a line to get into a girl’s pants. </p><p> </p><p>“You know, she doesn’t tell anyone this, but she’s a big gardener. Want some plant facts to get her off your back?” </p><p> </p><p>Billy was grinning, leaning in, “You’d really do that?” </p><p> </p><p>And Rio was nodding along. Because plant facts - she could do plant facts right now. </p><p> </p><p>And then there was a banging sound over the speakers in the dining hall, and as Rio looked up, Evanora was standing at a podium at the front of the dining hall, tapping her finger on the microphone in front of her. </p><p> </p><p>Then Evanora was speaking, and Rio had mostly pushed that out of her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Mostly. </p><p> </p><p>She told herself not to listen to Evanora. She really did. </p><p> </p><p>Because whatever was going to come out of her mouth was going to probably sting at Rio a little bit. </p><p> </p><p>And she was right. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve never been prouder of my daughter,” she said, and the words were light, effortless. “She has grown into such a smart, talented woman, and I couldn’t ask for a better person to take on the family’s legacy.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio stared back down at the tablecloth. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora was still speaking. </p><p> </p><p>But she couldn’t hear her anymore, not if she tried. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t like she hadn’t heard it all before. She had. In different forms, different ways over the years. </p><p> </p><p>It just is different to hear it in public, in front of other people. </p><p> </p><p>Because her dad died. And she was left with Evanora. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora never let her forget that. </p><p> </p><p>So Rio knew this. </p><p> </p><p>Rio knew Jen was taking on Evanora’s business at some point. </p><p> </p><p>Because it was her family’s legacy - and Rio, well, Rio was left with Evanora. Because her dad married Evanora, and then <em>died</em>.</p><p> </p><p>But dammit - it’s hard to hear in public. With other people clapping along. </p><p> </p><p>It was so stupid to even let it get to her, after all these years. Maybe she should’ve been over it by now. Maybe she was over it. Maybe the bottomless mimosas were getting to her. </p><p> </p><p>But she wasn’t sticking around to hear the rest of it. </p><p> </p><p>And so Rio stood up, and walked out of the room. She felt eyes on her as she left, but she didn’t bother to look back. She’s sure half the dining room watched her walk out the door. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t breathe. </p><p> </p><p>Her feet carried her forward, past the venue, past the parked cars, until she reached her van. Keys in hand. </p><p> </p><p>Then she realized she definitely cannot drive right now - not like this. Mimosas or not, her vision was tunneled and oh, her hands were shaking. She could hear the keys jangling somewhere down on her near her left side. </p><p> </p><p>Taking a look at her surroundings, she could go left towards the edge of town, or take a right and head towards main street. </p><p> </p><p>Her feet directed her automatically. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was trying to count her steps and center herself, she felt her lips in an ‘o’ shape as she was exhaling.</p><p><br/>
Damn, was she breathing that loud? </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly she was in front of shops on the main road, and they were all unfamiliar. A coffee shop that wasn’t there when she was in high school. And a record store? Was Westview even big enough to support a record store? </p><p> </p><p>Finally - she was standing in front of <em>Calderu’s Books</em>. </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t been here in - well Rio’s covered this already - eight years. But the sight of it still felt the same - warm, welcoming, like it had been waiting for her. </p><p> </p><p>She stepped inside, hearing the bell above the door jingle as it always did, and the scent of paper and coffee wrapped around her. Rio still hadn’t thought about where she was going as she turned and walked towards the corner - her corner - where, thank God, her chair was still there. </p><p> </p><p>It’s not really her chair - but Lilia used to let her read in it, undisturbed until Evanora’s curfew. </p><p> </p><p>She ran her fingers along the back of it, feeling the fray of the fabric. A well loved chair. Cherished. </p><p> </p><p>The sound of someone walking up behind her pulled Rio out of her thoughts, “Well, well. If it isn’t Rio Vidal.” </p><p> </p><p>And Rio turned and looked at Lilia, and she felt her mouth lifting into a second genuine smile today. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re still here.” </p><p> </p><p>Lilia laughed. “And you’re back. Come on, I have some coffee over at the counter.” </p><p> </p><p>Lilia was already turning around, knowing Rio would follow her. And she did. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia went behind the counter while Rio sat at a bar stool next to the register. She thinks it's the first time she’s sat in one of these bar stools even though she’s visited the store hundreds of times. </p><p> </p><p>Then Lilia was asking Rio what she did now, and Rio told her about her shop. Then she was asking her about how it was living in New York, and Rio was answering. She never once asked her what she was doing in Westview - but she must’ve known - everyone knew everything about everyone in Westview. Finally, Lilia ran out of questions, but Rio didn’t want the conversation to be over, so Rio asked about the bookstore. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s lips quirked, “I don’t run the place anymore, so I wouldn’t know.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowned slightly, “What do you mean?” </p><p> </p><p>Because it sure <em>looked</em> like Lilia ran the place. </p><p>None of the decorations had changed, Rio’s chair was still in the corner, the sign still said Calderu’s Books, hell Lilia was <em>behind</em> the counter. </p><p> </p><p>And Lilia just laughed. All-knowing like. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t like that. </p><p> </p><p>But the bell at the front of the shop rang, and Lilia was smiling at the customers that just walked in and - </p><p> </p><p>Of course. </p><p> </p><p>Rio should’ve known. Because for an hour, she hadn’t thought about Agatha. And the universe must have thought that was too long. </p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha was standing at the front of the door with Billy at her side, and she was pulling off her sunglasses and throwing her purse on the counter, walking in like she owned the place. She hadn’t noticed Rio, yet. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you for watching the counter. I know you’re doing it more later this week for the wedding, but I can’t thank -” Agatha looked towards the counter then. </p><p> </p><p>With Rio sitting across from Lilia. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t have to look to see Lilia grinning. She could feel it from where she sat. </p><p> </p><p>And Billy - Billy was grinning ear to ear. “Rio!”</p><p> </p><p>But Lilia was already grabbing at Billy’s shoulder, “Hey kid, I’m glad you’re here. I need you to help me bring in a few boxes from the delivery this morning.” </p><p> </p><p>And then it was just Rio and Agatha. Wait what? How did this happen so fast? </p><p> </p><p>Rio was still in her bar stool, staring at Agatha, who was staring right back. </p><p> </p><p>And if it was any other day, literally any other day, Rio would love this. She’d take her time with it, stretch it out, play whatever game to keep Agatha’s attention. </p><p> </p><p>But she really did not have it in her right now. Not after Jen pulled her into a photo because she needed one with her sister. Not after Evanora’s speech about the family legacy. Not after finding out Lilia doesn’t run her bookstore anymore. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio was also pretty quick - and Agatha was stepping behind the counter. </p><p> </p><p>So Lilia gave the bookstore to Agatha. Or sold it to her. Or something. Because Lilia said she didn’t run it anymore and there she was standing behind the counter. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Then she was talking to Rio, “You know, I had this whole plan to not engage with you today. Or for the rest of the wedding.” </p><p> </p><p>That was definitely not what Rio was expecting to hear. </p><p> </p><p>“Yet, here you are. Again. I can’t seem to escape you,” Agatha finished. </p><p> </p><p>“Here I am.” Rio replied, looking into Agatha’s eyes finally. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows furrowed, like she was concerned or - something. Rio’s not sure. </p><p> </p><p>Does Rio look that pitiful right now? This is why she came to the bookstore - to hide in her corner - to be away from other gazes, other people. </p><p> </p><p>Then there was silence again, both not breaking eye contact. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t mean to - but Rio broke first this time. Looking at the menu just behind Agatha’s head. </p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha was turning around, and grabbed a mug off the shelf, helping herself to some of the coffee behind the counter. And then she was turning back towards Rio again, taking a slow slip from her now full mug. </p><p> </p><p>“So.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow, “So?” </p><p> </p><p>“Have you met Ralph yet?” Agatha chose to ask. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio really didn’t expect that either. It’s like she couldn’t figure out Agatha’s next move, no matter how hard she tried. Because why did she ask that?</p><p> </p><p>“Haven’t had the pleasure,” she heard herself respond. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, pleasure is not the right word if you actually knew him.” Agatha responded. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe Rio was wrong - maybe she did have it in her. Or maybe it was just because her and Agatha were alone again. Rio’s not sure. </p><p> </p><p>“If I recall, last night you said the same nice things about him.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped to hers quickly, “Let’s not talk about last night.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio dramatically looked around the room, “Seems like now is as good as any.” </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t -” Agatha stopped herself. She started again, “I thought -” she stopped. Again. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah - Rio definitely did have it in her still, despite the emotional rollercoaster this morning. </p><p> </p><p>“You thought that I was someone else?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a harsh sip out of her mug, “And you knew exactly who I was.” </p><p> </p><p>Her words were sharp - like Agatha was holding onto them since last night. And she was looking into Rio’s eyes so unwavering, Rio had to look away - again. </p><p> </p><p>Twice. In like two minutes. </p><p> </p><p>“I did.” Rio said. </p><p> </p><p>Then she was looking at Agatha again, “So you just let me, what? Make a fool of myself?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowned, “Fool?” she said, not believing Agatha just said that. “You didn’t make a fool of yourself.” Rio’s head was shaking back and forth in disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>Is that really how Agatha felt about their… conversation last night? </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was nodding her head, and she looked like she was about to respond. So Rio beat her to it. </p><p> </p><p>“Would you really have kept talking to me if you knew who I was?” </p><p> </p><p>Checkmate. </p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha’s lips were pressed in a line. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay, Agatha. I know you wouldn’t have continued if you knew.” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re twisting it around.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio was leaning forward now, “Am I, though?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She finished her cup of coffee, though, and turned towards the sink behind the counter. She started washing the cup, so Rio continued. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s why I never told you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned back around, the coffee mug being dried off with a towel now in her hands. She kept their eye contact as she finished drying it off, not even glancing towards her hands as she put the mug back on the shelf. </p><p> </p><p>“I know I said it before, but thank you for what you did for Billy earlier today.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio should’ve known she’d changed the subject. But Agatha keeps surprising her. Ever since she showed up in Westview, Agatha makes moves Rio cannot predict no matter how hard she tries. </p><p> </p><p>“How mad was Evanora?” she heard herself asking Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Honestly? I don’t know. I try my best to avoid her at any event. But if I had to guess on a scale of one to ten? Sixteen.” Agatha said with a straight face. </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed. She sure loved when Evanora’s world burned in front of her. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio could see it - Agatha’s lips twitching like she was fighting a smile.</p><p> </p><p>The bell over the door rang again, and Billy was walking in, out of breath. Lilia followed behind him, brushing dust off her sleeves. </p><p> </p><p>“I really do love having a big, strong grandson,” Lilia said as she ruffled Billy’s hair. Billy squirmed under her touch but smiled nonetheless. And Agatha was looking at them both with an effortless smile. </p><p> </p><p>But for Rio? The dots were finally connecting. Because Billy was for sure Agatha’s. And that meant Agatha was Lilia’s. </p><p> </p><p>How Rio grew up in this bookstore and never realized Agatha was Lilia’s daughter was beyond her. But then again - Lilia never really talked to Rio when she was in the store growing up. She just let her be. And it’s not like Rio or Agatha talked before, well, now. </p><p> </p><p>Rio felt herself standing up out of her barstool, and was reaching into her wallet to buy the coffee.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was shaking her head, “Don’t worry about it.” </p><p> </p><p>Then she was grabbing the cup from the counter, washing it the same way she just washed hers. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you going to the spa thing tomorrow?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, “The what?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned and gave her a look, “The wedding party spa trip. In Eastview. The one Jen wants us all at?” </p><p> </p><p>And Rio was back in reality. In Westview. Talking to her stepsister’s best friend. </p><p> </p><p>“I know better than to miss it,” she responded, slipping both hands into her pants pockets. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, “Okay.” That’s all Rio got from her. </p><p> </p><p>But then Lilia was stepping in front of Rio, rubbing up and down Rio’s arms, as if she’s always done that to Rio, “You should stop by more often.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio really did not have a response to that, so she offered her trademark smirk, turned towards Billy and nodded at him and then was walking towards the door. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t need to turn around to know Agatha was watching her leave. </p><p> </p><p>She could feel it. </p>

<p>
<span>The door has barely shut behind Rio before Agatha let out a slow breath, pressing her hands into the cool counter to ground herself. She was not going to let this interaction between her and Rio consume her thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned and saw the stacks of boxes Billy must have brought in earlier while she and Rio were talking. Well - she definitely could go for some shelf stocking right now. Maybe if Billy helped her, she could keep the conversation going and avoid thinking about - </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wanna go to the movies,” Billy announced, climbing onto one of the bar stools near the register. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because of course he does. And of course he’s going to announce it while Lilia is here, she loves the movies. Agatha was pretty sure Billy had caught on that Lilia would take him to the movies to get out of chores, as long as he asked her in front of Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, “Oh do you now? This wouldn’t have to do with all the books I need help stocking, does it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia was stepping in before Billy had a chance to respond, “Now, I never made you stock the shelves while you were under my roof. He shouldn’t have to, either.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dammit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia was right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Lilia had adopted Agatha, she never enforced many rules. Curfew was before Lilia went to sleep - sometimes eleven, sometimes two. She never had to check in, as long as she stuck with Jen and Alice. Agatha definitely did not have to help out in the shop, which was really unfortunate for current Agatha right now, who wanted someone there with her as a distraction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But, Lilia had always trusted Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha promised herself when she and Wanda had officially become Billy’s guardians, she would give him the same trust Lilia had given her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine, you’re right. Go, both of you. Enjoy the movie. Bring back some popcorn if you have any left.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy’s smile was ear-to-ear as he literally dragged Lilia out of the front door with him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia was laughing as she was pulled along. “We’ll be back later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So Agatha did the only thing she knew how to do now that she was alone again: stocking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Unfortunately for her, it did nothing except to stop her from replaying her conversation with Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>You didn’t make a fool of yourself. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes at the memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>What did that even mean? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Was Rio actually into the flirting? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or was she just playing along - because that’s what Rio did. Because Rio played along with things, let the mess happen then moved on without a second thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Except, Rio did care. <em>She had to</em>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The makeup for Billy and now running out of the brunch after - was it Evanora that was speaking when she left? Yeah, it must have been because Agatha wasn’t listening to it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then why did Rio come <em>here</em>? To <em>her bookstore</em>? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead of her hotel? Or wherever she was staying. Not that Agatha has thought about it.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio obviously hadn’t known the store was Agatha’s now. Agatha remembered the surprise on her face when she walked behind the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she also remembers how easily Rio had spoken with Lilia. They had been talking for a while, judging by how comfortably Rio had been leaning on the counter - </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head and turned back towards the nearest shelf, adjusting a few of the books. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shouldn’t even be thinking about this. About her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because Rio was Jen’s step-sister. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or sister. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Isn’t that what Jen called her today when she asked for photos with her? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen surprised Agatha twice today. In the span of an hour, stood up to her mother in defense of Billy and specifically asked for a photo with Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her <em>sister</em>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bell at the front of the store ran out and she nearly jumped at the sound. Customers. A perfect distraction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She put on her polite customer service smile as she turned towards the entrance, greeting the couple who walked in. Agatha was even mentally patting herself on her back because she hadn’t thought about Rio the entire time she walked the couple through the aisles of bookshelves. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Until checkout. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At the register. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Right where Rio had been sitting earlier today. In her brunch outfit. <em>Leaning</em> over the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It took everything in Agatha to go back to the stack of boxes once her customers had left. But she needed to do it. Distract herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time Lilia and Billy returned from their movie, Agatha had emptied five of the boxes. Only five. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then Billy was telling her about the film, and that snapped her out of her thoughts real quick, because she was definitely following along. To the storyline of the movie they just went to see - </span>
<em>
<span>Spiderboy? </span>
</em>
<span>- yeah that one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Billy excused himself to the restroom, and Agatha felt Lilia’s eyes on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned to see Lilia watching her with a gleeful look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt her eyes narrow. “How do you know Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia’s eyebrows rose, “It’s Westview, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, “It just seemed like you guys have known each other more than just in passing, is all.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia tilted her head slightly before answering, “She used to come to the store everyday after school. We didn’t speak a lot, but she’d go hide in that corner in that chair,” she said while nodding towards the chair in the corner. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Everyday? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean everyday?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right after Ramiro died, she started coming here. I think it was a comfort spot for her. He used to bring her all the time when she was little. They stopped coming for a while, then Ramiro’s accident happened and suddenly she was here everyday.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had nothing - nothing -  to say at that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because how did Agatha not notice? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia continued when Agatha didn’t respond, “That’s why in high school I kept the store open until 9. That was Evanora’s curfew, I think. She’d do her homework. Sometimes she’d just read. We didn’t talk much. Actually now that I think of it, the conversation you and Billy walked in on was the longest time we’ve ever spoken.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, surprised. Nine had definitely been Jen’s curfew. She never let the three of them forget it. Nine on the dot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How had she never known any of this? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How did she not <em>notice</em>? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bookstore - the place that was now hers - felt different. Like a thread between her and Rio she hadn’t even known existed. That entire time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Billy was back, and he was asking Lilia about something, and Agatha turned back to her boxes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This time, she let herself think about Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because now she had more pieces to the puzzle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had come to the store because it meant something to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—--</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha drove Billy back to Wanda’s with a quiet goodbye. He didn’t linger behind in the car, he just gave her an absent wave as he rushed out of the passenger seat. She watched him walk into the complex, and waited for his text confirming he was inside before finally pulling away </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The drive home was a blur. She didn’t particularly mind it this time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her mind was too tangled to pay attention to the road, to the passing houses, the landmarks she’d driven by hundreds of times. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she pulled into her driveway, the silence and darkness of the house hit her immediately. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then headlights lit up her silhouette against the garage door. A car was pulling into her driveway next to hers - Jen and Alice. Jen was driving, with two grins plastered on their faces. Alice, in the passenger seat, raised two bottles of wine in her hands as Jen turned off the car and opened the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Want to watch a movie?” Jen asked, a grin still etched on her cheeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice was now waving a smaller paper bag in her hand now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ever since Billy became hers and Wanda’s - “watching a movie” was code for smoking. Because as much as she gave up all of her other bad habits - cleaned up her life - their life - after Pietro died, smoking weed was something she wasn’t willing to part with. That didn’t mean Billy had to know about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was already smiling, walking towards the two of them to help them with their bags of snacks and drinks, and whatever else Alice wanted to bring tonight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She loved when they came over like this - insistent, cheerful, alive with noise and energy. She never had to ask, they just knew when to be there. At her doorstep. With weed, or wine, most of the time both, and ready to distract Agatha as long as she needed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had good friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They settled in the living room when Jen started talking about the spa trip tomorrow. Alice was asking her questions about what to expect, what not to expect. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha already knew all of it. She’d memorized the agenda - remember? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Massages. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Facials. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Robes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Relaxation - Jen had insisted they’d all be relaxed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Overnight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just the four of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Oh <em>fuck</em>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The <em>four</em> of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because when Jen had planned the spa trip, she insisted Rio should come with them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hadn’t figured out the reason for that still - Jen had never insisted Rio was invited to things before - but that didn’t matter now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because - Overnight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Well, at least Evanora was paying for this trip, because Jen was already going on about how they all had separate rooms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because Jen had insisted on Rio being there, because it was her sister. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let Alice and Jen continue their back-and-forth about what they were most excited for. She, on the other hand, had given exactly zero thought to how she was going to handle this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With Rio there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span><em>Overnight</em>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then finally - finally -  Alice put something on  and Agatha let herself drown in the trashy tv. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—--</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She woke up to the sound of doors opening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A knock on her bedroom door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She cracked one eye open as it swung open. Alice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Oh right. Alice and Jen had stayed over. Because they smoked a lot, and she’s pretty sure they drank even more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, and Alice - the bitch, who never got hangovers - was grinning far too brightly but, mercifully for Agatha, she kept her voice low. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, I’m taking Jen back to Evanora’s so she can pack. Then I’ll grab my stuff and come back for you in, lie, an hour so we can head to the resort.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Fuck. The spa trip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s getting too old to consume this many substances in one night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt herself nodding as she shut her eyes again. She heard her bedroom door close and she let herself feel nauseous for all of about twenty seconds before she pushed herself up on her elbows. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Shower. She could shower. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then get ready.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For the spa trip. Overnight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just the four of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let the hot water clear her head, grounding herself in the warmth and steam, letting it wash away the haze of last night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then she made the mistake of looking in the mirror.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yeah. She was going to need more than an hour.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If she could clean up enough, maybe she wouldn’t look as shitty as she felt. Not that anyone would notice—because no matter how awful she felt after a night out, she could hide it just as well. If not better.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Luckily, she had packed ahead of time. Three days ago, to be exact—because as much as Jen micromanaged the wedding, Agatha was not going to be the reason anything came off the rails. Including this damn spa trip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So, back to getting ready.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Knowing Jen, this place was probably even fancier than the golf club for brunch yesterday.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha found a dress that would work. Then heels. Okay, yeah, a full face today. She had to cover last night a little.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let her hair air-dry, and by some miracle, it fell into loose waves down her back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly, she felt like herself again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Except for the headache. And was she still a little high?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Did they have edibles last night?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t let herself dwell on it because she heard Alice pulling up in her driveway. Grabbing her bag off her dresser, she headed outside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And got into—Jen’s car? That Alice was driving?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Oh, right. Jen had been dropped off to pack.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha barely had time to register it before Alice was whistling as she pulled on her seat belt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha gritted out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing, nothing. You just look good.” Alice smirked. “That wouldn’t have anything to do with who’s joining us today, would it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “We talked about this yesterday. Nothing is going to happen between me and Rio, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice’s smirk only deepened. “Maybe nothing will happen. But do you want something to happen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned toward the window, letting the sunshine soak into her skin. The sun will make her feel better, surely.<br/>
</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled on her sunglasses anyway. </span>

<p>
<span>Rio pulled up to the resort in her van, shutting off the GPS directions as she pulled under the canopy for valet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she knew it, her keys were out of her hand, her bag already brought inside, and she was left on the steps in front of the entrance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a moment to take in her surroundings. The place was all white stone and glass, with sleek fountains bubbling on either side of the main doors. It was the kind of luxury that screamed </span>
<em>
<span>Evanora paid for this</span>
</em>
<span>, and Rio had no complaints.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A honk from behind pulled her from her thoughts as a car rolled up to the exact spot her van had just been. Rio spotted Alice in the driver’s seat, Jen in the passenger, and possibly a figure in the back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then the doors opened. Jen and Alice stepped out first, but Rio’s focus was on the back door, which finally swung open. A single heel touched the pavement, and then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness. In a dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not just any dress. A deep blue, silky number that clung in all the right places and left Rio momentarily incapable of rational thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The slit up the side revealed just enough of Agatha’s toned leg that Rio’s mouth went dry. Her hair fell in effortless waves down her back, and when she slipped her sunglasses off—sharp blue eyes met hers, staring directly at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could catch flies right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even notice Alice stepping in front of her until a hand waved in front of her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I help you?” Rio asked, blinking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, you’re in the way. Move.” Alice snapped, but she was smiling—no, grinning—more like the Joker.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did not like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped aside as Jen walked past, announcing she’d check in for the group. Alice followed, and then Agatha—done speaking with the valet—moved toward her, sunglasses now perched on her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready for this?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, pressing her tongue against the inside of her cheek. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“You look really good, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened, her cheeks immediately turning the lightest shade of pink. Like she hadn’t known she looked like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh—uh—thank you,” Agatha responded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t stop the smirk if she tried. </span>
<em>
<span>Finally</span>
</em>
<span> throwing Agatha off balance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, let’s get our room keys.” Rio gestured for Agatha to walk ahead, up the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yeah, Rio absolutely watched the way the dress moved with Agatha’s hips. The slit ran up her thigh, offering more skin with every step. She didn’t even care that she was staring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, more attendants held the doors open, and Rio was once again thankful Evanora was footing the bill. Rio would never, ever pay for something like this out of her own pocket. She caught up to Agatha as they reached the front desk, where Jen and Alice were already dealing with the receptionist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“-there are four people in my party. I </span>
<em>
<span>specifically</span>
</em>
<span> booked four rooms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need to hear the beginning of that conversation to know this was about to go </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry, ma’am,” the receptionist said, looking appropriately regretful. “There was an error on our booking site, and many rooms were overbooked. I have three rooms available for your party. But, like I said, we’d be happy to cover your next spa day here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could </span>
<em>
<span>laugh</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The universe must think her life is a movie. Or a book. Something fictional. Because this does </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> happen to anyone but her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at Jen, whose forehead vein was </span>
<em>
<span>pulsing</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha looked like a fish out of water, trying to formulate a response. Alice was rubbing Jen’s upper arms in a clear attempt at soothing her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio needed to intervene before this spiraled into something that personally affected </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, Jen, I’ll just go back to the hotel. You guys enjoy the trip, it’s not a big deal. I’ll see you tomorrow for your dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She refused to look at anyone else. Didn’t need to see their reactions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Jen shook her head. “No, no. We’ll share a room. I want you to be here with us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice nodded, still rubbing Jen’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Agatha spoke up. “No, Jen. It’s your wedding. Rio and I can share a room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s </span>
<em>
<span>eyes could pop out of her head</span>
</em>
<span>. Because </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn't Agatha just say yesterday she was trying to avoid Rio? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’m for sure not sharing my room,” Alice chimed in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes. Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>laughed</span>
</em>
<span>. The receptionist handed out keys, explaining how to get to their rooms, along with a printed agenda for the spa itinerary.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Alice and Jen walked off, leaving Rio alone with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her ears were ringing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha worried her bottom lip between her teeth. “I promised Jen I wouldn’t let anything get in the way of her wedding. Nothing could derail it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a light laugh. “Jen and I sharing a room wouldn’t have derailed her wedding. I think you just wanted to be alone with me, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t wait for a response. She plucked the key from Agatha’s fingers and started walking toward </span>
<em>
<span>their</span>
</em>
<span> room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She heard Agatha grunt behind her, but she followed. Rio could hear the distinct sound of heels against tile all the way to their door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sliding the key in, she waited for the click before pushing it open, gesturing for Agatha to enter first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She flipped on the lights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Has Rio mentioned she’s </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> happy Evanora is paying?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room was </span>
<em>
<span>nice</span>
</em>
<span>. Way nicer than most places Rio ended up. Including her apartment back in New York.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their bags were already waiting in the corner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To her right—</span>
<em>
<span>a massive bathroom</span>
</em>
<span>. A shower that could fit a </span>
<em>
<span>group</span>
</em>
<span> of people.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned back toward the main room and had to stop herself from running into Agatha’s back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha had stopped abruptly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Boo,” Rio whispered, right in Agatha’s ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped a bit but then continued forward and oh -</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio peered over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ohhh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio </span>
<em>
<span>laughed</span>
</em>
<span>. Couldn’t stop it if she tried.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to glare at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She almost felt bad. Almost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If Rio were writing a book, she </span>
<em>
<span>couldn’t</span>
</em>
<span> have made this better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of </span>
<em>
<span>course</span>
</em>
<span> there was only one bed. That </span>
<em>
<span>she and Agatha had to share</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then—flashbacks. Last night’s conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I had a plan to not engage with you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I can’t seem to escape you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Escape.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And while Rio loved playing games with Jen, Agatha, and even Alice—this wasn’t a game anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They had one bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To share.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Overnight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha had </span>
<em>
<span>just</span>
</em>
<span> said yesterday she was trying to avoid her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t about to push past that boundary.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a king-sized bed. We’ll put pillows in the middle so you don’t accidentally spoon me in the middle of the night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s wide eyes flicked to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio arched a brow. “We’re adults. We can handle one night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed. Nodded. “Yeah. Pillows in the middle. Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> tried not to be disappointed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Really, really tried.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha was Jen’s best friend. Her step-sister’s best friend.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio does not get her hopes up for women. She stopped that years ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was easier to just find someone who was willing than be dragged along by someone who didn’t want her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But dammit—Agatha looked good. And she had flirted with Rio first, before realizing who she was. She had been into it. Into </span>
<em>
<span>Rio.</span>
</em>
<span> At least, she had to have liked what was on the surface. Why else would she have flirted?</span>
</p><p>
<span>So maybe Rio was a little disappointed. But what was she expecting?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not like she’d thought they’d end up </span>
<em>
<span>sharing a room.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not like Agatha would’ve pulled Rio inside by her shirt, pressed her against the door, kissed her the moment they were alone for the first time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That would be </span>
<em>
<span>preposterous.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Yet, she felt it anyway. That tiniest bit of disappointment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s not going to look into why she felt that. Not right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, distractions. She needed a distraction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked around the room. Agatha was still circling the room, pointer finger resting on her bottom lip like she was trying to decipher her next move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, right. They were at a </span>
<em>
<span>spa resort.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Surely Jen had something planned soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at the shared schedule. </span>
<em>
<span>Massages in twenty minutes.</span>
</em>
<span> Right next to those words: </span>
<em>
<span>Please arrive in the robes provided.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. Because now that the bed situation was sorted, she could definitely </span>
<em>
<span>play</span>
</em>
<span> again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had moved into the bathroom, messing with what Rio assumed was her makeup bag—lipstick now in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess we should get undressed, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lipstick tube clattered into the sink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had to bite back a laugh at the sound of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked, wide-eyed again. That deer-in-the-headlights look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was really starting to </span>
<em>
<span>like</span>
</em>
<span> that look on Agatha. At least then, she was keeping Agatha on her toes instead of the other way around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio waved the schedule toward her. “Massages? Twenty minutes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply. “Oh. Right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she was </span>
<em>
<span>looking</span>
</em>
<span> at Rio again, like she was waiting to see who would undress first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t know why Agatha’s stare made her break. Every damn time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced back down at the paper, then at the robes hanging in the bathroom, right next to Agatha. She stepped into the doorway, grabbed one, and backed out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How about you change in here, and I’ll change out there?” Rio offered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes. That’s—good. We can do that.” Agatha’s voice was just the tiniest bit breathless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly. “We can do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she shut the door and turned back toward the bed to change.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of thinking about the </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> naked woman on the other side of the door, Rio focused on folding her clothes—actually </span>
<em>
<span>putting them away.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>If it had just been her in the room? She would’ve tossed them in the corner. But distractions were good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tied her robe and—oh. </span>
<em>
<span>Right.</span>
</em>
<span> Massages first, then facials.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She definitely didn’t want her hair down for that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio crouched to dig through her backpack, checking each pocket. And of course—</span>
<em>
<span>she’d left her hair ties in her car.</span>
</em>
<span> Or maybe in her </span>
<em>
<span>other</span>
</em>
<span> hotel room. In </span>
<em>
<span>Westview.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Well. At least she was sharing a room with a woman who </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> had a hair tie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Agatha?” Rio called—maybe a little too loud, but she didn’t want to startle her by knocking. </span>
<em>
<span>While she was changing.</span>
</em>
<span> Into a robe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Rio?” Agatha yelled back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have a hair tie I can borrow?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh—” Agatha started, like she had to </span>
<span>think</span>
<span> about it. “Yeah, there should be some in the big pocket of my duffel bag. Help yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted, kneeling over Agatha’s bag, unzipping it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s when she heard the bathroom door </span>
<span>swing</span>
<span> open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait—actually, let me grab it for you!” Agatha blurted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too late.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had already opened the bag. And sitting </span>
<em>
<span>right</span>
</em>
<span> on top—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well. She really couldn’t have written it better herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bright. Purple. Vibrator.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right there, resting, on top of all of Agatha’s things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. Recognized it immediately. Hell, she was a lesbian in New York. She was pretty sure she’d seen every kind of vibrator and dildo in </span>
<em>
<span>every</span>
</em>
<span> shape and color.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha’s?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, she recognized </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And before she could stop herself—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Huh. I have the same one in green.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, she turned toward Agatha—who had </span>
<em>
<span>bolted</span>
</em>
<span> from the bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Besides the fact that Agatha looked very, </span>
<span>very</span>
<span> good in that robe—something Rio was </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> going to be thinking about later—her cheeks were bright red.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin stretched wide. She winked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—casually—went back to looking for a hair tie.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha knew the second Jen turned to her with that vein in her forehead was pulsing, that she needed to save the day, quickly. Because that’s what Agatha was planning to do, any time something didn’t go exactly right for Jen’s wedding, she was going to fix it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Jen was always there for Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So sure enough, she found herself blurting out, “No, Jen. It’s your wedding. Rio and I can share a room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the best option. Really. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Letting Rio and Jen share would’ve been a disaster waiting to happen. Rio would say something, Jen would explode and they’d be going home one hour into their overnight spa trip. Or someone was going to end up buried in the spa’s zen garden. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice would never share a room, especially not with Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So Agatha can handle one night. One single, perfectly normal, nothing-to-think-about night sharing a room with Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Or so she thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because now she was following Rio down the hall, watching the way the woman moved in front of her. Annoyingly at ease with the situation they were in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Like Rio hadn’t just practically thrown Agatha into oncoming traffic with that stupid little smirk and her insufferable teasing. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You just wanted to be alone with me, Agatha. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>No. She wanted </span>
<em>
<span>Jen</span>
</em>
<span> to have a relaxing spa trip. For her wedding. That was all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio unlocked the door and gestured for Agatha to enter first. She did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she stopped dead as she got closer to the bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not two queens, not even a pull-out couch. Just one, massive, perfectly made, king-sized bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Boo!” was whispered in her ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She jumped. So what? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio was way too close, leaning over her shoulder and then of course she was laughing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to glare at her, but Rio wasn’t even fazed. She was clearly </span>
<em>
<span>enjoying</span>
</em>
<span> this. Like the universe had just handed her the best joke of all time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a king-sized bed,” Rio said, still amused. “We’ll put pillows in the middle so you don’t accidentally spoon me in the middle of the night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted, her thoughts skidding to a sudden, jarring stop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed. Nodded. “Yeah. Pillows in the middle. Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You can handle this.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha busied herself with grabbing her makeup bag, heading to the bathroom and running lipstick over her lips. She just needed a distraction, something to focus on that </span>
<em>
<span>wasn’t</span>
</em>
<span> the one-bed situation, or Rio’s teasing, or the very real possibility of waking up in a compromising position. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because dammit, Agatha does cuddle at night. </span>
</p><p>
<span>No matter who she is in bed with, when she wakes up she’s attached to the other person, either being held or holding them, it doesn't matter. Unconscious Agatha liked touch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Pillows. Rio said pillows in between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She heard Rio approaching the bathroom and then, “I guess we should get undressed, huh?” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>WHAT?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even notice she had dropped her lipstick in the sink before she was looking wide-eyed at Rio, now leaning on the wall across from the bathroom door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she was waving a piece of paper towards her, and oh - spa trip. Schedule. Jen’s wedding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They probably do have something to do soon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was already breaking eye contact before Agatha finished catching up.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed a robe from the towel rack next to Agatha, “How about you change in here, and I’ll change out there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” She heard herself replying, “That’s - good. We can do that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe she was out of breath a little bit. Maybe she was too busy thinking about getting undressed in front of Rio to breathe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Rio was smiling at her, softly, like she wasn’t just teasing her a second ago, “We can do that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The bathroom door shut in front of Rio and Agatha was alone again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Well - alone in the bathroom at least. Because on the other side of that door, Rio was probably taking off her jeans and - robe. She needs to grab a robe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And change herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she was tying her robe, she heard from the other side of the door, “Hey Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Rio?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have a hair tie I can borrow?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh -” just this morning Agatha was patting herself on the back for packing well ahead of her trip. Now? She’s not sure what’s in the bag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she knows she’s packed a hair tie. She had to have packed a few hundred hair ties. She always does. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Like underwear. Leaving for one night? Agatha was packing four pairs of underwear and thirty hair ties. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So yeah, she has to have hair ties - in the big pocket of her duffel bag. “Yeah, there should be some in the big pocket of my duffel bag. Help yourself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Agatha remembered that she packed the bag under the assumption that she was going to have the room to herself - </span>
<em>
<span>alone</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh. Oh no. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was pulling open the bathroom door before giving herself the chance to glance at herself in the mirror, “Wait - let me grab it for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio was already unzipping. And then Rio froze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t need to see the bag in front of Rio’s crouched body to know what she was looking at. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck - is it hot in here? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt her cheeks warm immediately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stumbled over what to say next. What do you say to your best friend’s stepsister, who you were flirting with a couple of nights ago (because, hey, sorry, didn’t recognize you there), and now you’re sharing a room with her, definitely not thinking about how she was naked just a second ago, and she’s just found your vibrator?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s very purple, curved near the tip, eight inch vibrator. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sitting on top of her neatly packed clothes. Mocking her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The universe is cruel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio was turning towards her, “Huh. I have the same one in green.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>blacked out</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not literally, but she </span>
<em>
<span>might as well have</span>
</em>
<span>, because what the </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span> was she supposed to say to </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing. The answer was </span>
<em>
<span>nothing</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stormed over to where Rio was crouched over, bending over and not thinking about how close they suddenly were- in robes. In their very large hotel room they were sharing. With one bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved her hand around in the bag for a few seconds - found a hair band and shoved it toward Rio. “Here. A hair tie. Take it. </span>
<em>
<span>Go away</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. Like she </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span>. Like she was committing every second of this moment to memory for future torment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She plucked the hair tie from Agatha’s fingers, twirling it around her wrist. “Thanks, roomie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled through her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The knock at her - their - door came just as Agatha was forcing herself to breathe through that lingering humiliation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s voice rang through the door, “Let’s go, slackers!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, casting one last glance at Rio, who was still wearing that smug little grin but now her hair was up in a messy bun, exposing new skin on her neck she hadn’t seen before and nope - massages. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yanking the door open, she stepped past Jen out into the hotel hallway, not waiting for Rio to catch up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>—-</span>
</p><p>
<span>The walk to the spa was quick, and Agatha was more than ready to get out of her own head. She has spent way too much time up there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Way too much time up there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she laid down on the massage table and felt warm hands knead into her shoulders, she realized how much tension she’d been carrying. Between running the shop, Billy, and dealing with Wanda’s bullshit, there hadn’t been a second to just breathe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But now? </span>
</p><p>
<span>The pressure on her muscles was enough to pull her under. She melted into the table, eyes fluttering shut, and let herself relax for the first time in - forever? </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they were done, she felt weightless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio met her gaze as they walked out, her expression also softer than usual. Probably matching her own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relaxation looks good on you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. She was expecting more teasing from Rio. She was actually wanting it right now, just to ground herself back to reality. But besides the one comment about sharing a room when they first got here, Rio has been nothing but nice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even about the vibrator earlier today. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So many things could’ve come out Rio’s mouth when she saw that, instead she chose, </span>
<em>
<span>I have the same one in green. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was not going to be thinking about whether Rio used that on herself or if that was for who was in bed with her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So the massage got her out of her head for like an hour. She’ll take whatever she can get. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go get ready for dinner, yeah?” she asked Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she’s <em>not</em> deflecting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>—- </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Agatha and Rio arrived at the resort’s restaurant, Alice was already at the table, scrolling through her phone with a glass of water in front of her. She looked up as they approached, a slow, knowing grin spreading across her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, look who decided to show up together,” Alice said, setting her phone down. “I didn’t realize this was a couple’s retreat.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, not letting herself look at Rio for a reaction from her. Pulling out a chair, “Where’s Jen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sighed, taking a sip of water. “She texted - she’s running late. I guess Ralph called her, demanding to know where she was because there was a wedding crisis.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course. Because Jen’s entire life for the last six months has been a wedding crisis. From Ralph. Interrupting their time together all the time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fantastic.” Agatha deadpanned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a moment to smooth out the fabric of her dress - this one loose, unlike the one earlier today. It draped over her frame in a way that made her look relaxed - the way she should be feeling at a spa resort. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked good - with what seemed like zero effort. While Agatha took about twenty minutes to get ready in the bathroom, Rio had said “Ready!” in about two minutes. When Agatha stepped out of the bathroom, Rio was lounging on the bed, scrolling on her phone. She was wearing a soft linen shirt, the top few buttons undone, and had a pair of drawstring pants that hugged her hips just enough that Agatha’s brain short-circuited. For like half a second. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she was not looking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stretched in her seat and glanced towards the bar, “Since Jen’s not here yet, I can grab us drinks. What’s everyone having?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice jumped in first, “I’ll take a gin and tonic.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha asked for a glass of white, and then Rio was standing up. Unbeknownst to Rio, a waitress had just walked up behind her and suddenly they were colliding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay - not colliding, but she bumped her. With her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> notice the waitress’ hands on Rio’s shoulder right where they collided as she spilled out apologies. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where were you headed?” she heard her ask. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m grabbing some drinks from the bar,” Rio responded, small smile on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can show you where the bar is, if you’d like.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Rio was nodding, “Sure, thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed as they walked away towards the bar together. The waitress lingered - </span>
<em>
<span>lingered</span>
</em>
<span> - next to Rio, walking a little too close as she led her to the bar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha heard Alice’s laugh next. She turned towards the noise and Alice was stirring her straw in her water, “Oh, this is delicious.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her. “Why didn’t she just take our drink order? And I don’t know? Bring us the drinks? Isn’t that what a waitress does?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice rested her chin on her hand, “Agathaaaa,” Alice drew out. “Are we jealous?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Jealous?! </span>
</em>
<span>I’m not jealous.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhm. And I’m the Queen of England. Actually, you should be bowing to me right now. Where is my butler? I need to request a gin and tonic - Rio is taking quite too long.” Alice started, with her horrible, horrible English accent she pulls out way too often for Agatha’s taste. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, crossing her arms and ignoring the rest of whatever Alice was saying. She was not </span>
<em>
<span>jealous.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio is a big girl. She could’ve found the bar herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at the bar again, the waitress still leaning in towards Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>See? She’s found it herself with her eyes. Three times already. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need a tour guide to the bar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was patting Agatha’s arm to get her attention. Suddenly, Alice was looking serious which is way different than the amusement plastered on it just a minute ago. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look,” Alice said, voice quieter now, “I need to talk to you about something and it needs to stay between you and me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice never asks that. Keeping something from Jen? </span>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them never keep stuff from each other. But that also meant Alice meant business.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay. Not leaving us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sighed, like she had something really big to say but wasn’t sure how to start it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice, just spit it out. Before Jen shows up or Rio comes back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, look. I’ve been thinking about Jen and Ralph. And I know - I know Evanora is holding the business over Jen’s head if she doesn’t get married. But Ralph? He’s wrong for her, Agatha. You know it’s a bad idea. I know it is. Everyone but her seems to know. I’m pretty sure Evanora knows that Ralph and Jen won’t work. She can’t marry him, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned, feeling the weight of Alice’s words settle in her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because dammit, she did know. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ralph is a douche. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Evanora? Evanora is worse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Which is why Jen is with Ralph. It’s why they’re getting married. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s the last step of Evanora’s plan for Jen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Jen gets married, all of it is hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha remembers the day Jen told them that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They were in high school spending the night at Evanora’s, just the three of them, huddled on Jen’s bed watching a movie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Jen spilled it all out - everything. Step by step what Evanora expected from her. A timeline of her life.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>But if Jen followed Evanora’s plan for her? The business, the properties, the money, the legacy. All of it would be hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>From then on, Jen started to become a little more uptight. Bound by Evanora’s power over her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s actually not even sure how Jen and Ralph met, or most of their love story. Jen doesn’t bring him up much in conversation when it’s just the three of them. Unless she has to step away for a call from him, she never mentions him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew Jen wanted it. All of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And she couldn’t blame her - if roles were reversed, she’d do anything to get what is Evanora’s now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But it always sat so heavy in Agatha’s stomach that Jen was marrying him. Her best friend deserves happiness. Companionship. Love. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ralph is not the person to give her that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you saying?” </span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The waitress was still talking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t really listening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave polite nods, a hum here and there, but her eyes never left the bartender as he made her drinks. She just wasn’t interested.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which Rio was trying really hard not to panic over because, by all counts, the waitress was beautiful. And into Rio. Or at least trying to show interest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Any other time, Rio would thrive off of this. She’d keep eye contact the entire time, even when her drink arrived, even when the straw got just past her lips. If that didn’t work, she had eight other moves lined up, one right after another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But right now?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just wanted to be back at the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Scout’s honor—this had nothing to do with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay—maybe some of it had to do with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But not because she wanted Agatha. Well—actually, she was just pretty sure Agatha didn’t want her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha was </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> engaging.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither here nor there—because this had nothing to do with wanting Agatha or not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was because they were sharing a room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With one bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’d be weird to flirt with someone when Agatha was going to be there at the end of the night. In the same space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Plus, it was Jen’s wedding spa trip. She wasn’t about to ruin Jen’s wedding by bringing a waitress back to their shared room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, so Jen’s wedding had literally nothing to do with this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was never a scout.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whatever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bartender was sliding the last drink toward her now anyway, so she didn’t need to keep thinking about this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With three drinks in hand, she caught the waitress pouting out of the corner of her eye. “Sure you don’t need help carrying those?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled sweetly. “I think I’m okay, thanks though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned before the woman could say anything else, heading back to the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she reached it, she caught the end of Alice saying something to Agatha in a hushed but firm voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“—not stopping the wedding. Just encouraging Jen onto another path, is all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio set the drinks down over Agatha’s shoulder, making her jump slightly. Alice, on the other hand, didn’t even look surprised at Rio’s interruption. She almost looked pleased?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved around the table and back to her seat as Alice continued. “Good, you can be in on this too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at Agatha, who looked shocked. Was she really that surprised that Alice would include her in whatever they were scheming?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want to stop the wedding?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice looked smug at the question, but Agatha sighed and responded first. “Alice thinks she can stop the wedding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice interjected, “No, not that I can do it. But that we—” she pointed between the three of them, “—can stop the wedding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence fell over the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was actually considering it. Whatever </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> was—a plan to stop the wedding or whatever Alice had up her sleeve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She liked to watch the world burn, remember?</span>
</p><p>
<span>But stopping the wedding? That wasn’t going to work. Not with Evanora playing puppeteer behind the scenes. They wouldn’t even get halfway through whatever plan Alice had before Evanora caught on and shut it down. And if Rio was tangled up in it? Well, her contract with Evanora would be null and void.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not going to work,” Rio finally said, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice frowned. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward, resting her forearms on the table. “We have, what, four days before the wedding? The only way this stops now is if Jen chooses to stop the wedding herself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s expression told Rio everything she needed to know. She was right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me ask you both this,” Rio continued, looking between the two of them. “Have you ever asked Jen about Ralph? Like, what qualities does she actually like about him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Alice both looked like deer caught in headlights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You guys have never asked her, have you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice spoke first. “I don’t like Ralph enough to ask.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha added, “And Jen never brings him up either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was flabbergasted. That was the only word for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them? Inseparable since Ramiro and she had moved in with Evanora and Jen. If one of them committed murder, the other two would bring shovels and alibis.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fact that neither of them knew anything about Ralph just proved how much they disliked him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts were interrupted when the waitress from earlier was suddenly standing behind Agatha, Jen in tow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was starting this plan now, even if she hadn’t agreed yet—because stirring the pot?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio excelled at it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen sat down in the seat next to Alice, “Sorry, sorry - Evanora had Ralph all panicked about the venue, I had to calm him down, then I had to calm her down. Anyways - what did I interrupt?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Alice both looked like they were fumbling with something to come up with, so Rio swooped in, “Actually, Jen we were talking about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked surprised that Rio responded so quickly, the other two doing the same thing. Probably because they weren’t sure what Rio was going to say next.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio loved this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, yeah, you. This is your week after all, is it not?” Rio responded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Alice both deflated - visibly - Rio might add. So maybe getting in on a scheme with them wasn’t the best idea since they both were not subtle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back in her chair, grabbing her drink as she went, “So, how did he propose?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen blinked. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was on the right track already.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’m sure they’ve heard the story but as your sister, I want to know. Every little detail. Tell me everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She saw Alice bite down on her little straw on her drink. Agatha was watching the interaction intently with her chin resting in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a small laugh, she said “Oh, you know. The usual way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow. “The usual way? Forgive me but as a raging lesbian, I wouldn’t know the usual way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen waved a hand, “That’s not what I meant, stop it. I just meant, he was on one knee, ring in hand, and then did the whole thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally - finally -  Alice was catching up, because she gave Jen an unimpressed look, “That’s every proposal, Jen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was right behind Alice, “Yeah, Jen I actually haven’t heard this story before, please share.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s eyes shot towards Agatha, “There’s not much to say, I mean it was nice, it just wasn’t some </span>
<em>
<span>big grand</span>
</em>
<span> thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, but Jen, getting proposed to is like - every little girl’s dream - come on, tell us - even just a little bit.” Alice was adding on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, it was a proposal, he got down on one knee and asked. I said yes. Now we’re here.” Jen responded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was about to start but Alice and Agatha weren’t just caught up to speed now, no - they were running the play.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio needed to catch up now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice is right, you know. Wanda and I are separated, but I could tell you what day, what she said and how she did it. Down to the flowers.” Agatha responded, laying it on thick.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, so maybe Rio is lucky she wasn’t sipping on her drink when Agatha said that, because </span>
<em>
<span>Wanda Maximoff</span>
</em>
<span>?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio has not thought about her since - well, since she left Wanda under the bleachers during senior year.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda and Agatha, though?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She did not see that coming at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Wanda were a thing halfway through senior year. Stolen kisses under bleachers and in bathrooms and in cars. Never public. </span>
<em>
<span>Never</span>
</em>
<span> in front of anyone else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that hadn't mattered to Rio, she let herself chase Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Up until Rio left Wanda underneath those bleachers. Because Wanda had told her six months into their relationship - the day before graduation - that she wasn’t gay and she couldn’t go to New York with her after graduation, because she was going to Eastview community college with Vision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s what her parents had wanted for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio assumed Wanda had ended up with Vision and they had their own little American Dream somewhere in Eastview.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But now - Agatha had just said her and Wanda had been together. Separated, now, actually.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was really trying not to look shocked right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because they had a plan - get Jen to stop the wedding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was pulled right back into the conversation when Alice asked Rio if she had met Ralph before - she knew the answer, but she was making a point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So maybe Alice could be a scheming partner in the future.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, actually, I haven’t had the pleasure yet.” Rio responded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t need to say anything else - because Rio saw it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment the doubt crept in on Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dinner was on Evanora’s credit card, so Rio kept ordering drinks. Because—hello—spa trip on someone else’s dime? She was going to enjoy it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At drink three, Jen excused herself to her room, mumbling about needing to get up early to talk to Ralph. Or Evanora. Rio wasn’t sure which one. She wasn’t listening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At drink five, Alice was rubbing her stomach like a man after Thanksgiving dinner and excusing herself because she wanted to go pass out in the really cold AC of her hotel room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then it was just Rio and Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t counted Agatha’s drinks, but she saw it refilled at least twice by the waitress, who still wouldn’t leave Rio alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ignored her advances each time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that it mattered. The woman hovered every chance she got—brushing too close when she set drinks down, smiling a little too wide when she asked if Rio wanted another round.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But maybe she noticed the way Agatha had started glaring at her glass between sips, her fingers tapping on the table a little harder each time the waitress spoke to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Huh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Rio asked, watching her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, eyes snapping to Rio’s. “Why wouldn’t I be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, slow and easy. “You just looked like you were about to pick a fight with your wine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and finished what was left in her glass. “I’m perfectly fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was a lie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe Rio was buzzed, but Agatha was being weird, and they still had to share a bed tonight, so Rio pushed back from the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“C’mon, roomie,” she said, holding out a hand. “Let’s get out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked up at Rio, caught off guard by the sudden movement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What, you can’t hang with little old me?” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “Not exactly. I was thinking about relocating. It’s stuffy in here.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>If ‘stuffy’ meant ‘a waitress who can’t take a hint and is ruining Agatha’s mood.’</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She wiggled her fingers, still holding out her hand, and Agatha finally grasped it, standing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She led them out, stopping at the bar to order a bottle of Agatha’s wine to be sent to their room—on Evanora’s tab, of course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked through the restaurant, the expansive lobby, and down the hall, still hand in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio definitely wasn’t hoping to whatever god was out there that her hand wasn’t sweating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she was pulling a keycard from her back pocket and opening the door for Agatha, just like she had earlier today, waiting for Agatha to cross the threshold first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flipped on the lights as she followed Agatha inside, suddenly very aware of the lack of hand in hers—and the one-bed situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she had brought Agatha back here to feel better, not worse. So she went straight to the bed and lined the pillows up down the middle, just as she’d said she would.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel Agatha’s eyes on her the entire time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Turning back toward her, Rio asked, “While we wait for the wine, do you want to get in our pajamas?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile was light, but her tone was unmistakably teasing. “What, are you expecting us to play two truths and a lie? Or spin the bottle?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio narrowed her eyes. If Agatha wanted to play, she could play too. “No, I just wanted to change in separate rooms like we did earlier. But if you want to be immature about this, Agatha, that’s fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, Rio turned toward the corner where her bag still sat and pulled her shirt over her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, wait, wait—fine! Fine. I’m sorry. Please put your shirt back on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused, then pulled her shirt back down. She turned too quickly—too many drinks for that—but steadied herself before facing Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her cheeks were flushed again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio liked when Agatha’s cheeks flushed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like she had control, even just for a second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A knock at the door snapped them both out of their moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked past Agatha, opening the door and pulling the cart inside. The wine she’d requested sat over ice, two glasses beside it. And a fruit platter?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Had she ordered that?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was pretty sure she hadn’t, but it didn’t matter. Their first toast was going to be to Evanora’s credit card either way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bathroom door clicked shut—Agatha changing. Rio grabbed her own pajamas, swapping her clothes for a clean graphic tee and sleep shorts. Easy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She poured the wine into both glasses just as Agatha slipped out of the bathroom behind her, climbing into bed without a word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t look. She should have, but she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She handed Agatha a glass, their hands meeting briefly over the pillow fort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she leaned back against the pillows—dammit. The lights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sighing dramatically, she set her glass on the nightstand, flipped on the lamp, and stumbled—partially—to the switch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she returned, Agatha was looking at her phone, glasses now perched on her nose, covers tucked just under her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dammit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whatever she was wearing was barely there. A thin spaghetti strap clung to her shoulder, the only thing standing between Rio and a very, very bad idea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio should have watched her walk to bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or maybe it was better that she hadn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha had said she wasn’t going to engage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio needed a distraction. Now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She crawled back into bed, grabbing her wine and taking a long drink. That would help, right?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, which one is it?” Agatha’s voice cut through Rio’s thoughts. “Two truths, or spin the bottle?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced over the pillow fort, resting her elbow against it, watching Agatha. She laughed softly. “How about we just talk? Or find a movie? I’m sure there’s something on one of these hotel channels.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said, shaking her head. “Let’s talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay…” Rio took another sip. “What do you want to talk about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why did you become a florist?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. She hadn’t expected that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had answered this question before, usually in a bar, with a wink and a cheesy line. But the real answer? No one had ever asked for that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s good money,” she deflected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “No, it’s not. Try again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed. “Why are you even asking? It doesn’t matter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, it does matter.” Agatha’s voice was softer now. “I’m asking because I want to know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, then took another drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a second, it looked like Agatha really cared about her answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She set her glass down on the comforter in front of her, running a hand through her hair. “Okay, fine. Have you ever noticed how flowers don’t fight death? They just exist—and then they don’t. But in between? They’re beautiful. They don’t linger, clinging to life. You put them in water, give them light, and they bloom. When their time is up, they just let go. No fuss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a constant reminder of how to live. You can’t grip life too hard. Can’t make it something it’s not. You just hold onto whatever beauty you’re given—for as long as you can. And when it’s time to let go… you let go. No fuss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t told anyone that before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence stretched, making her feel small in the bed. She exhaled, only now realizing she’d been holding her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The mattress shifted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she looked up, Agatha was closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Much closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel her breath against her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Agatha reached past the pillows—taking the glass from Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wait.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was that it? Was this conversation over?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, placing both glasses on the nightstand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t trying to fuck this up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Had she teased too much? Had she—</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t fuck up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips were on hers.</span>

Like she just shared her deepest darkest secret.  </p><p>So Agatha knew it’s the truth. </p><p>She could tell Rio didn’t share the real answer with many people. It’s too personal. Not on brand. </p><p>But Rio hasn’t really been on brand this entire week. </p><p>First, she was flirting back with Agatha. Sure, failing to share her identity with Agatha screamed <em>Rio scheme</em>, but she flirted back. Then she gave Billy makeup, a teenager she had never met before. <em>Her</em> teenager. Then she came to the bookstore and told Agatha she hadn’t made a fool of herself. </p><p>All day today, Rio had been nothing short of patient and kind. When Rio found the vibrator sitting in her bag, she could have taken it fifty different ways, all of them teasing. Instead Rio chose a completely different path - <em>I have the same one in green. </em></p><p>After their massages today - <em>Relaxation looks good on you. </em></p><p>And Agatha definitely spent more attention on the flirting waitress than Rio. She barely gave the waitress more words than her order and a polite thank you. Like she didn’t want to engage. </p><p>Like she wasn’t interested. </p><p>And then she practically dragged Agatha back to the room, not ending the night. No. Instead, they got wine for the room because - <em>It’s stuffy</em>. </p><p>Rio hadn’t said it like a pickup line. She said it like she just wanted to leave. With Agatha. </p><p>For Agatha. </p><p>Okay, maybe <em>that</em> was wishful thinking. But everything else? Not wishful thinking. </p><p>And right now? </p><p>Rio couldn’t look at her. </p><p>She had just shared something meaningful. </p><p>And - <em>fuck</em>. </p><p>Agatha has been wrong. This entire time. </p><p>Rio Vidal gives a shit. About everything. </p><p>And Agatha can’t take it. </p><p>She doesn’t let herself overthink - she just moves.</p><p>Moves to grab the glass out of Rio’s hand. </p><p>Moves to take off her glasses. </p><p>Moves to kiss her. </p><p>Over the pillow barrier Rio had carefully crafted minutes ago. </p><p>For Agatha. </p><p>She didn’t let it be hesitant. It definitely wasn’t careful. </p><p>It was urgent, because fuck - Agatha can’t take it anymore. </p><p>Rio makes a small noise against her lips - maybe surprise - but she responds instantly. She feels her hand move up to caress her cheek, running back and through her hair, gripping but not tugging. </p><p>Agatha wants to touch her everywhere, but she can’t because of the pillow pile. Yeah, that needs to go. Now. She pulls back from Rio’s lips, and dammit Rio is chasing her. </p><p>Like she doesn’t want to lose the contact. </p><p>Agatha gets up on her knees, before bringing a finger up to Rio’s lips, stopping her from following. </p><p>“Hold on, hold on,” she says, with a light laugh. </p><p>Without so much as looking, she grabs the pillows from the pile, one by one, throwing them in the room behind her. Rio is smiling against her finger, and lets out a small laugh when one of the pillows makes something crash off the desk behind her. </p><p>Her laugh is cut off the moment the last pillow is thrown, because Agatha replaces her finger with her lips, biting down on first contact. She moves forward, pressing Rio down with one hand on her sternum, the other on the bed beside Rio’s head. </p><p>Rio’s hands fly up to Agatha’s hair again, one on each side, and is pulling Agatha closer. Agatha lets out a small moan, because Rio pulls with just the perfect amount of pressure. </p><p>Of course she does.</p><p>She needs to be closer. </p><p>She starts to shift and Rio is following her lips again, like a magnet.  Agatha pulls one leg over Rio’s lap, straddling her. She’s rolling her hips down as she deepens the kiss, pressing her back into the pillow. Agatha opens her mouth when she feels Rio’s tongue lick at her bottom lip. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>She tastes like the wine they were drinking earlier tonight and Agatha cannot get enough. She sucks, bobbing her head a little as she does so and Rio moans. But then Rio’s hands are leaving her hair and Agatha nearly whines - whines - at the loss of contact.  </p><p>But then Rio’s hands are on the back of her thighs, squeezing just a bit each time Agatha grinds down. </p><p>Agatha pulls away for air, just for a second, and as she does so, she opens her eyes to Rio’s looking right back at her. Her breath as uneven as Agatha’s, eyes wide and flushed. </p><p>Agatha needed more. </p><p>She grinds her hips again, this time Rio meets her with a thrust back. </p><p>Agatha dives into Rio’s neck. </p><p>She moves her hand from Rio’s chest up to her hair and tilts her head back so she has better access. She kisses up the line of her throat, to the side of her neck and stops at the spot right below her ear when she feels Rio’s breath hitch. </p><p>She feels Rio’s hands move, off the bare skin of her thighs up to her ass and then she’s squeezing again. This time harder than before, pressing Agatha into her with each grind of her hips. </p><p>Suddenly, Agatha remembers what her choice of pajamas were for this trip. Unlike before with the vibrator incident, she’s patting herself on the back for the tank top and sleep shorts. </p><p>Rio squeezes hard when Agatha bites down on Rio’s neck and Agatha barely catches the moan in her throat. </p><p>Well -  half of it. </p><p>But Rio’s neck had to have muffled it, at least a <em>little</em> bit. </p><p>It didn’t. </p><p>Rio definitely heard it. </p><p>She feels it in the way Rio suddenly grips her waist, flipping them over effortlessly. Their lips don’t even break apart. It happened so fast, Agatha’s not sure if she’s dizzy from the wine or from the switch of positions.  </p><p>Doesn’t matter.</p><p>Because Rio is <em>still</em> not close enough. </p><p>She slides her hands down, grabbing Rio’s waist and pulling to get her closer. As she does so, Rio is pulling back, separating their lips. Agatha is following her this time, trying to reconnect, but she can’t because Rio’s forehead is resting on her chin and she can hear Rio take deep, shaky breaths like she was trying to calm down. </p><p>And then Rio’s removing her hands from her waist to the bed - Agatha is assuming -  because they’re not on her. </p><p>Rio is stopping.</p><p>Agatha bites her lip, staring at the ceiling, attempting to slow her breath. Suddenly the room is feeling warm. She can feel her heart pounding in her chest. She hears the hum of the AC hum, can smell the lotion on Rio from their massages earlier.</p><p>It’s like she’s coming back to her senses.  </p><p>Agatha is really trying to not overthink this but dammit - had she really been wrong? </p><p>Did Rio not want this? </p><p>Did Rio not want her? </p><p>And maybe Agatha was right because Rio is pulling back, head off her chin and she lets out a loud exhale. Agatha really tries to not acknowledge it, but her stomach flips at Rio stopping. </p><p>And pulling away. </p><p>And not wanting her. </p><p>Because she wanted Rio. </p><p>She wanted her since the night at the bar. </p><p>And the universe hated her. </p><p>It put her and Rio in a room with <em>one bed</em>. </p><p>And she tried to suppress it. Her want for Rio.  </p><p>But then she finally gives in - despite the possible consequences of sleeping with her best friend’s sister - and Rio doesn’t want her back. </p><p>She feels her eyes squeeze shut, quick and harsh. She doesn’t want to see Rio rejecting her. </p><p>She really can’t take that. </p><p>But then - </p><p>Warm fingers grip her chin. Firm. Not forceful. </p><p>“Agatha, look at me.” </p><p>She can’t.  </p><p>She won’t. </p><p>She feels soft pressure on her chin and she lets her head tilt forward, but her eyes stay closed. Her lips press into a straight line as she tries to take deep breaths through her nose. </p><p>“Agatha, please.” </p><p>Rio sounds desperate. </p><p>So -  she lets her eyes flutter open. Brown eyes are staring back accompanied with a small smile.  </p><p>“I just need to make sure that you’re okay with this, Agatha.” </p><p>Like she hadn’t just jumped her. In bed. The one they’re sharing. </p><p>Like she hadn’t initiated all of this. </p><p>But Rio isn’t rejecting her.</p><p>She’s not angry.  </p><p>And Agatha had been wrong - again. </p><p>Because Rio was checking to make sure she was okay with this. When Agatha had been the one to initiate it. </p><p>And dammit - Rio cares. </p><p>She couldn’t trust her voice right now, it wouldn’t be convincing - but she needed Rio to know she wanted this - needed her. </p><p>She reaches down, not breaking eye contact, and grabs at Rio’s hand near her side, guiding both of their hands down her stomach to the waistband of her shorts. She shifts her hips a little as she slides both hands underneath, guiding her fingers to swipe at her center. The moment Rio makes contact, slipping through her, Agatha’s hips buck and she bites down on her bottom lip to keep from making a sound. </p><p>Rio on the other hand moans - honest to God moans - as her fingers slip through her folds, and then she’s falling forward, face pressed into Agatha’s neck. </p><p>Agatha tangles a hand in Rio’s hair, letting her hips roll as she felt fingers tracing teasingly along her skin. </p><p>Rio’s touch was too light. </p><p>Fuck Agatha wants more. No, she <em>needs</em> more. </p><p>Rio must be able to read her mind because she nods roughly against Agatha’s neck, then suddenly, her hand is was gone. This time Agatha does whine at the loss of contact, but it’s cut short when Rio pulls back and sucks her own fingers into her mouth. </p><p>And fuck - her tongue was wrapping around her fingers like a goddamn performance, like she wanted Agatha to watch. Heat pools deep in her stomach. She’s going to combust. </p><p>Agatha tightens her grip in Rio’s hair and yanks her forward. Rio’s fingers left her mouth with a sinful ‘pop’ and finally, their lips are reconnecting. Agatha tasted herself on Rio’s lips, barely there but distinct from the wine she tasted earlier. </p><p>Rio’s hand slides up Agatha’s arm, slipping beneath the strap of her tank top, easing it off her shoulder. Her lips leave Agatha’s, dragging a path over her cheek, down her jaw, settling at her neck. Agatha feels Rio’s tongue press just beneath her ear and her hips buck against her on their own accord. </p><p>She feels Rio mumble something against her neck, and the vibrations send a shiver through her body. But she can’t decipher it. </p><p>With the hand still gripping at Rio’s hair, she tugs, pulling Rio off her neck. “What was that?” </p><p>Rio’s looking down at Agatha through hooded eyes, “I said, I want to taste you. Will you let me taste you?” </p><p>And yes - yes she can. </p><p>Agatha swallows but still can’t trust her voice, so she nods eagerly up at Rio, hoping it’s enough. </p><p>Of course it isn’t. </p><p>“Tell me,” Rio murmurs, gaze dark and intent. “Tell me you want it. I want to hear you say it. Tell me you want me to taste you.” </p><p>If Agatha hadn’t been soaking already, she sure as hell was now. </p><p>Fuck - she could listen to Rio talk to her like this forever. </p><p>She knows Rio’s not moving until she says something. And Agatha needs this on record - because normally, <em>normally</em> - Agatha doesn’t beg. </p><p>She’d rather get herself off than beg for it. </p><p>But right now? </p><p>Right now, she’s desperate. So fucking desperate she can feel herself dripping.  </p><p>So she asks for it. </p><p>No - she begs.  </p><p>“Please.” Her voice comes out breathless, raw. “I want it, Rio.” She cups Rio’s cheek, “I need you to make me come in your mouth. Please.” </p><p>And truly, that’s all Agatha’s going to give her. </p><p>Luckily, it’s enough for Rio. </p><p>Rio groans, like she needed to hear it. That Agatha wants her. </p><p>Her head dips back down to Agatha’s neck and she feels fingers trail down her stomach, stopping at the hem of her tank top. Then the fingers are hooking underneath the fabric of her tank top and tugging. </p><p>Agatha gets the hint immediately, sitting up just enough to help Rio pull the shirt off. </p><p>Rio’s lips trail further down, her tongue swiping over Agatha’s nipple and fuck - Agatha’s back arches into the touch, a moan slipping from her lips before she could stop it.</p><p>She feels Rio smirk against her skin, but she doesn’t linger. Instead, she keeps moving downward, shifting further down the bed. </p><p>When Rio settles between Agatha’s legs, they spread immediately and Rio’s smirking up at her - again. </p><p>Her lips ghost over Agatha’s stomach, trailing slow, teasing kisses down to the waistband of her sleep shorts. Agatha bucks up in search of friction, but Rio grips her hips firmly, stilling her. </p><p>She feels fingertips dip beneath the elastic and her shorts were sliding down her legs. </p><p>Rio tosses them somewhere behind her without looking, her gaze locked onto Agatha’s center. </p><p>Because Agatha doesn’t wear underwear to bed. </p><p>If she wasn’t so turned on, she’d almost feel shy at the attention. </p><p>But she doesn’t get the opportunity to overthink it, because Rio settles back down between her thighs, lifting Agatha’s right leg over her shoulder and pressing her hand on her left leg, spreading her even further. </p><p>She watches Rio lean further down and finally, her tongue makes contact. </p><p>Agatha’s moan was obscene, but she was too far gone to care. </p><p>She stares at the tongue flicking at her, but it wasn’t enough - the pressure was too light, like Rio wanted to drag it out of her. Tease her. </p><p>She can’t keep her hips from rolling, seeking more. Immediately Rio pulls her head back, and all contact is lost. </p><p>Rio’s smirking up at her as if this is entertainment, as if Agatha isn’t about to implode. </p><p>Agatha groans but she stills her hips. </p><p>She’s rewarded instantly. </p><p>Rio dips down again, pressing the flat of her tongue against her, the pressure finally enough. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes slam shut.</p><p>Her hands find home in the sheets beneath her, gripping to try to steady herself from grinding into Rio’s mouth. </p><p>Agatha lets out sounds she knows she hasn’t made before when Rio’s tongue starts exploring. It’s too much and not enough at the same time. She’s pretty sure Rio knows she’s torturing her. </p><p>Finally, Rio’s tongue starts to swirl and Agatha opens her eyes to watch Rio’s head start to bob as well, matching her movements. </p><p>Rio’s eyes snap open to meet Agatha’s as she slows her movements and Agatha is about to grab her hair because anymore teasing is going to make her snap. </p><p>Then Rio’s tongue is dipping inside of her. . </p><p>Her head falls back on the pillow and she loses herself in the feeling of Rio’s tongue thrusting in and out of her. She doesn’t even bother trying to hide her moans because each time she makes a sound, Rio is pressing harder, faster. </p><p>Rio’s hand slides up Agatha’s body, fingers pinching at her nipple and Agatha can’t be still anymore. One hand goes to Rio’s head, tangling in her hair, following Rio’s movements but not pressing. Her other hand is restless, it moves around her side, around the bed, gripping the sheets then fingers flexing. </p><p>She feels Rio’s hand on her hip slide forward and downwards and then two fingers are circling Agatha’s clit. </p><p>“Oh fuck, baby, that’s going to make me come,” she gasps. </p><p>She feels Rio moan against her, and the fingers on her clit move faster. Rio must really like to hear Agatha. </p><p>She gives her more.  </p><p>“Fuck, baby your tongue feels so good.” Her voice was ragged, breathless. “I’ve been thinking about you all week. I need to come, baby. Please, let me come in your mouth.”</p><p>That does it. </p><p>Rio doubles her efforts, and she feels the coil in her stomach tighten. She feels Rio’s touch everywhere, her senses overwhelmed. </p><p>Then Rio starts to move her head side to side, and her tongue hits a spot inside her that makes her back arch off the bed and yank at Rio’s hair. </p><p>“Fuck, do that again.” </p><p>Rio does. Over and over again. </p><p>Agatha’s moans come in quick succession, louder with each twist of Rio’s tongue. Through hooded eyes, she manages to look down at Rio and when brown meets blue she’s thrown over the edge. </p><p>Agatha gasps, falling back into the pillow and her hips buck into Rio’s mouth uncontrollably. Rio’s hand stays on her clit, continuing her movements but she keeps her tongue still, deep inside her. Agatha can feel herself clenching on the tongue inside her, and she’s overwhelmed by the waves of pleasure coursing through her. </p><p>“Holy shit,” she gasps out, her body starting to twist. Rio’s hand leaves her chest and goes down to her hip, holding Agatha still while she coaxes out the remainder of her orgasm. </p><p>She doesn’t stop until Agatha uses the hand wrapped in her hair to pull her back. Rio’s fingers still, pulling away, the grip on her hips slowly starts to lighten. </p><p>Agatha throws a hand over her eyes, sucking in slow and deep breaths in an attempt to calm herself down. </p><p>Of course Rio is that good in bed. </p><p>She feels Rio shifting below her and then lips are trailing up, stopping just before Agatha’s throat and then she’s pulling away. Agatha’s almost afraid to see the smirk she knows that’s plastered on her face. Almost. </p><p>Because Rio’s smirk is not going to deter her from returning the favor.</p><p>So she removes her hand and blinks open her eyes, Rio doesn’t have a smirk on her lips. Just a small smile. </p><p>Her arms are bracketing either side of Agatha’s head, and she’s hovering just far enough that Agatha would have to lean up to kiss her. She feels the weight of Rio’s body just slightly on her lower half, like Rio is holding herself up. </p><p>“Didn’t you say you weren’t going to be engaging with me?” Rio asked, her tone light and teasing but still, just a small smile resting on her lips.  No smirk to be seen. </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but she lets herself smile, her breath finally starting to slow. She reaches up and grabs at Rio’s arm, rubbing up and down in small circles. </p><p>She will be returning the favor.</p><p>As soon as her heart isn’t trying to burst out of her chest. </p><p>Rio didn’t seem to mind just staying there for a moment, and Agatha watches her eyes move, like Rio was tracing her face with them. </p><p>They snap back to Agatha’s and then - yep - there it is - Rio’s smirk makes its way to her cheeks. </p><p>Agatha is still trying to calm down but that damn smirk means Rio’s about to do something. </p><p>Agatha was right. </p><p>Rio leans down and sucks a nipple in her mouth, hard enough that Agatha can’t stop the low moan that slips free. She arches up into Rio’s touch, and the hand that was rubbing Rio’s arm is now a death grip, her nails digging into Rio’s skin. </p><p>They could leave marks at how hard she’s grabbing. Agatha doesn’t care. </p><p>Just as Rio’s tongue starts flicking back and forth, Agatha tangles fingers in Rio’s hair and pulls her off and then up so they’re face to face. </p><p>Of course that damn smirk is still there. </p><p>“What, you can’t hang with little old me?” Rio teases, her voice light and smug. </p><p>Any other time, Agatha would have seen it coming. Her own words thrown back at her. But in her defense, she just had some of the best sex - if not the best sex of her entire life - and the woman was still on top of her. So maybe it’s taking a bit for Agatha to process. Or think. Sue her. </p><p>Instead of a sharp retort, or flipping Rio over and having her way with her, Agatha chooses a different tactic.</p><p>She loosens her grip in Rio’s hair, trailing her hand down to cup Rio’s cheek. The smirk on Rio’s face begins to fade, her expression shifting as Agatha pulls her down into a deep, slow kiss. She drags it out, savoring it, letting Rio pull back only when she needs air. Their eyes meet, and Agatha finally speaks—because Rio really liked it ten minutes ago.</p><p>“No, baby,” she murmurs, her lips just barely brushing Rio’s. She watches as brown eyes darken, caught in hers. The hand that was gripping Rio’s arm moves, trailing down her side, stopping at the curve of her ass—just resting.</p><p>Rio’s face softens even more.</p><p>Agatha strikes.</p><p>Her fingers curl into Rio’s sleep shorts, gripping the fabric as she tugs Rio’s body fully against hers. Her other hand slides from Rio’s cheek to her throat, wrapping around it—not enough to restrict, just enough to apply pressure.</p><p>Rio lets out a surprised groan.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t give her time to react before continuing, voice dropping lower.</p><p>“You just made me come so hard in your mouth, baby. I need to feel you come on my fingers. Can I make you come? Please?”</p><p>She worries her bottom lip between her teeth, watching as Rio’s mouth falls open slightly.</p><p>Agatha knows she hit her mark.</p><p>She tilts her head up, closing the small distance between them, just about to claim Rio’s lips when—</p><p><strong>Knock knock</strong>.</p><p>Rio either doesn’t hear it or chooses to ignore it, pressing forward against Agatha’s hand on her throat, closing the gap.</p><p>Agatha isn’t stopping either. She bites at Rio’s lip, tightening her grip just slightly. She hears Rio moan—but more than that, she feels it beneath her fingers. She wants to hear it again. Feel it again—</p><p><strong>Knock knock</strong>.</p><p>Agatha pulls back with a growl, glaring toward the door.</p><p>Whoever is on the other side better have a <em>damn</em> good reason.</p><p>Like someone died.</p><p>Even then, Agatha isn’t convinced that would be a good enough reason to interrupt this.</p><p>Rio’s eyes are still closed, her head heavy in Agatha’s grip.</p><p>“Agatha? Rio? Are you guys awake?”</p><p>That voice sobers Agatha immediately. </p>

<p>Rio thinks she should be thanking the universe.</p><p> </p><p>Because as much as it had been against her the last few days—specifically whenever Agatha was involved—Agatha’s grip on her throat was making her quickly forget all its wrongdoings.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe it wasn’t just the grip on her throat that made her forget the universe had been working against her. Maybe it was the last hour of her life.</p><p> </p><p>To be fair, Rio knew Agatha was hot.</p><p> </p><p>Over the last few days, Agatha had worn a multitude of outfits that Rio’s mind could filter through like a rolodex.</p><p> </p><p>White shirt at the bar.</p><p>Dress at brunch.</p><p>Dress when they arrived at the resort.</p><p>Comfy but cute shirt at dinner.</p><p><em>Dress when they arrived at the resort</em>.</p><p> </p><p>So yeah, Rio knew Agatha was hot.</p><p> </p><p>And she knew—even if Agatha denied it—that she had been watching Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Hopefully looking for her, Rio would like to add.</p><p> </p><p>She was watching when Rio gave Billy makeup.</p><p>She was watching when Rio took photos with Jen.</p><p>She was watching when Rio spoke with Lilia at the store.</p><p> </p><p>A woman watching Rio? Hot.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t know she was <em>this</em> hot.</p><p> </p><p>She won’t admit it—seriously, press a gun to her head, she’s not going to admit it—but she had spent the past few days imagining what it would be like to be with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha would sound like under her touch.</p><p>What she would taste like.</p><p>What she would feel like.</p><p>What she would look like.</p><p><em>What she would taste like</em>.</p><p> </p><p>And now?</p><p> </p><p>None of her imagination compares to what Rio just witnessed.</p><p> </p><p>No, not witnessed.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Caused</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t realized that watching Agatha unravel, hearing those breathless little sounds slip past her lips, feeling her hands claw at Rio’s skin, would hit her like a freight train.</p><p> </p><p>Now that she had experienced it firsthand, she didn’t think she’d be able to stop.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to stay in this bed forever.</p><p> </p><p>Forget the wedding, forget the world, just stay wrapped up in Agatha, memorizing every inch of her, listening to every moan, every sharp inhale, every breathy plea.</p><p> </p><p>And she was so close to getting what she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice had been low, teasing, that baby slipping past her lips so easily that Rio had nearly lost her mind.</p><p>Then came the grip on her throat, the pressure just enough to make her body light up in all the right ways.</p><p>Then the word—please—made her stomach tighten, her hips twitch forward before she could even think.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha begging. For her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was ready to let Agatha do whatever the fuck she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha’s hand was on her throat. She was begging to touch Rio.</p><p> </p><p>And then she was leaning up to meet Rio halfway.</p><p> </p><p>And then—</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>Knock knock.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio ignored it. She barely even heard it over the rush of blood in her ears. She was too caught up in the moment, in the way Agatha’s hand flexed against her throat, in the way she was looking at her.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>Knock knock.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha growled.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio felt that growl in places she really shouldn’t have.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck, Agatha was hot. Why haven’t they been doing this the whole time?</p><p> </p><p>Holy shit.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted Agatha to do that again. Maybe right against her ear. Maybe—</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back, and Rio felt the loss of her immediately.</p><p> </p><p>Then—</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha? Rio? Are you guys awake?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p> </p><p>That was Jen.</p><p> </p><p>And suddenly Rio remembers why they haven’t been doing this the entire time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was Jen’s best friend.</p><p> </p><p>Her sister’s best friend.</p><p> </p><p>And really—truly—Rio wouldn’t normally care.</p><p> </p><p>She wouldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha did.</p><p> </p><p><em>Does</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels it.</p><p> </p><p>The moment Agatha panics.</p><p> </p><p>She sees it too, but it’s long after—at least long after in Rio’s mind—that she feels the panic. Her body tenses beneath Rio’s, the grip on her neck snapping away and pressing on Rio’s shoulders instead. Her eyes go wide, like she’s terrified.</p><p> </p><p>Then the hands on her shoulders are pushing, and Rio doesn’t have time to react before she’s being launched to the other side of the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit, shit, shit,” Agatha whispers under her breath, sitting up so fast she tangles herself in the sheets. She doesn’t even seem to notice, too busy whipping her head around the room like she’s searching for an escape route.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinks, adjusting to the sudden shift in energy, the rush of heat still coursing through her body now clashing against the cool air hitting her skin.</p><p> </p><p>She feels goosebumps. She shivers.</p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha is reaching for the robe draped over the chair. Pulling it on.</p><p> </p><p>Tying it tight.</p><p> </p><p>Hiding.</p><p> </p><p>That’s the word for it, isn’t it? <em>Hiding</em>.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio knows—of course she knows—that Agatha wouldn’t just fling the door open, freshly fucked, the bed a wreck behind her and Rio still tangled in the sheets.</p><p> </p><p>She knows Agatha wouldn’t just let Jen see her like this.</p><p> </p><p>She <em>knows</em>.</p><p> </p><p>So why the actual fuck does it sting?</p><p> </p><p>Why did she expect—no, want—Agatha to do exactly that?</p><p> </p><p>Her stomach twists.</p><p> </p><p>She’s going to be sick.</p><p> </p><p>Because this feeling—it’s familiar.</p><p> </p><p>It’s high school.</p><p> </p><p>It’s Wanda sneaking her behind buildings, meeting her under empty stairwells, leaning in close but never too close where someone could see. It’s the way Wanda had kissed her like she needed her but refused to look at her in the hallways.</p><p> </p><p>The way Rio had been a secret.</p><p> </p><p>And secrets? Secrets are easy to push aside. Easy to ignore. Leave behind.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio had told herself she didn’t care. She made herself not care.</p><p> </p><p>And then lived her life as if she didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>But now?</p><p> </p><p>Now, she’s back in Westview. Okay—Eastview <em>right now</em>, but you get the idea.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s back home.</p><p> </p><p>Giving makeup to a teenager.</p><p>Taking photos with her sister.</p><p>Sitting in her bookstore.</p><p> </p><p>Now, she’s sitting in a bed Agatha had just had her in, watching her yank a robe tight around her.</p><p> </p><p>And she hates it.</p><p> </p><p>She hates that she cares.</p><p> </p><p>Hates that it makes her throat tight, that it makes her fingers twitch with the urge to reach out, stop her, force her to stay tangled up in the sheets, to look at the mess they’d made and own it.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha is already at the door.</p><p> </p><p>Then—</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>Knock knock.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>“Guys, are you awake? It’s important,” Jen’s voice carries through, casual, oblivious.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitates, fingers on the lock. She flips the lock with a click, turning her head at Rio and putting a finger to her lips as if to shush her.</p><p> </p><p>As if Jen could see the bed from this angle.</p><p> </p><p>As if Rio wasn’t actively craning her neck to watch Agatha at the door.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wanted to laugh. Or scoff. </p><p> </p><p>The door cracked open just enough for Agatha to poke her head out. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen, being Jen, immediately tried to push inside. Agatha blocked the doorway like her life depended on it, shoulders squared, robe cinched tight. From the bed, Rio watched the light from the hallway stretch shadows across the room, flickering as the two of them jostled against each other in the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>And then Jen grunted in frustration, the struggle ceasing. “Fine, Harkness, I won’t come in. Just came to tell you—the hotel found an extra room.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat up slightly at that.</p><p> </p><p>“So you guys don’t have to share.”</p><p> </p><p>The words landed heavily in the room, but the real weight was in the silence that followed.</p><p> </p><p>Was Agatha going to take it?</p><p> </p><p>Would she kick Rio out?</p><p> </p><p>But more importantly—was the night over? </p><p> </p><p>Okay so please sue Rio for thinking with her clit. </p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha had just been touching her. She had been looking at her with that dark, heated gaze, and Rio was pretty sure she would’ve already finished if this interruption hadn’t come knocking at the door.</p><p> </p><p>She barely registered Agatha saying, “Oh. Thanks,” before sticking her hand out through the narrow crack in the door.</p><p> </p><p>Rio assumed Jen was handing her a key card, but from this distance, she couldn’t quite tell. What she could see was Agatha slamming the door shut with finality, her back hitting the wood as she let out a breath.</p><p> </p><p>And then—</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t even know the room number,” Jen’s voice through the now closed door. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk was immediate.</p><p> </p><p>Now that was funny.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who had been so quick to shush Rio, who had buried herself in that damn robe like she could will away what had just happened, had slammed the door shut without getting the actual information she needed.</p><p> </p><p>Because she wasn’t going anywhere.</p><p> </p><p>The realization settled warm and easy in Rio’s stomach, sending a slow, pleasant burn through her chest.</p><p> </p><p>It definitely felt better than what she was feeling thirty seconds ago. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cursed under her breath and cracked the door open again. “Sorry, I—” she cleared her throat. “I drank too much wine.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen made a sound. One of those sure, let’s go with that noises. “Okay, well, the room’s over by me and Alice. Room 237. Want me to walk you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said quickly. “I don’t need you to walk me.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen, ever the menace, pushed. “You sure?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>That knowing hum again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t even realize she was holding her breath until she heard Jen’s steps retreating down the hall.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally locked the door, flicking the bolt with a quick snap of her wrist. She lingered there for a moment, fingers still curled around the handle, before spinning on her heel. Her back pressed against the wood, her lip caught between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>And fuck.</p><p> </p><p>Even now, after a full-blown panic, in nothing but a hotel robe, Agatha still looked good.</p><p> </p><p>The dim lighting softened the sharp lines of her face, throwing her cheekbones into dramatic relief. Her hair was a mess—a sexy mess—wild and tangled from Rio’s hands. And then there was the way the robe sat just barely open, gaping slightly at the top, hinting at the skin beneath.</p><p> </p><p>Like the universe was <em>daring</em> Rio to untie it.</p><p> </p><p>But then—Agatha looked down.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio didn’t like that.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want Jen to know,” Agatha said, voice quieter now. “She can’t know, Rio.” She exhaled, fingers tightening around the belt of her robe like she could anchor herself to it. “She’s so stressed right now, and I can’t add to that.”</p><p> </p><p>And there it was.</p><p> </p><p>The gut punch.</p><p> </p><p>Because yeah, that didn’t feel good.</p><p> </p><p>It settled like an ache in Rio’s chest, sharp and uninvited. She knew what this was. She knew it wasn’t something to flaunt. And yet—hearing Agatha say it so definitively, like it was important that Jen never know—</p><p> </p><p>It stung.</p><p> </p><p>But then—Agatha looked back up.</p><p> </p><p>“But,” she said, a small smirk tugging at her lips, “I was serious when I said you made me come really hard.” She shifted slightly, one hand releasing the robe to tuck a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “And I would really like to do that again. If you’d let me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her.</p><p> </p><p>Torn.</p><p> </p><p>Because that had hurt. It had yanked her straight back to a place she never wanted to go again—no, a place she refused to go—where she was kept in the shadows, a secret to be hidden, something to be tucked away because someone was too afraid to claim her.</p><p> </p><p>But—</p><p> </p><p>Logically, what would telling Jen actually do?</p><p> </p><p>Rub it in Jen’s face?</p><p> </p><p>Make the wedding even more complicated?</p><p> </p><p>And—Jen had been nice to Rio on this trip. Not just tolerating her, but actually trying. Like she was making amends. Or at least attempting to.</p><p> </p><p>And then—there was Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Looking at her like that.</p><p> </p><p>Standing in the dim light, her robe just barely clinging to her body, with lips that still tasted like wine and her, with those sharp eyes and flushed skin, and—</p><p> </p><p>Fuck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heartbeat kicked up.</p><p> </p><p>Because her want for Agatha?</p><p> </p><p>It outweighed all of it.</p><p> </p><p>So yeah.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t care. </p><p> </p><p>At least, not right now. </p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Agatha woke up warm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Which was unusual, considering she was alone in bed far more often than she wasn’t. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It took her a second to remember why. To place the weight draped over her waist, the slow, steady rise and fall of the body behind her, the faint tickle of breath against her shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her eyes stayed closed as she exhaled, pressing her face deeper into the pillow. She hadn’t been held like this in a long time. Hadn’t woken up with someone still wrapped around her, clinging to the heat of the night before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It felt—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She swallowed against the thought, forcing herself to stay still. The last thing she wanted to do was wake Rio up. Not when she could steal a little more time like this. Not when she could let herself sink into it for just a moment longer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>God, the sex had been good.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Better than she’d had in—fuck, longer than she wanted to admit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Better than Wanda.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And it wasn’t just the sex.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was the way Rio had looked at her, touched her. The way she had wanted to touch her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It had been effortless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And fuck—she wanted it again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sure, she had been tipsy last night. But nowhere near drunk. She knew what she was doing when she leaned over and kissed Rio first. She’s pretty sure Rio wasn’t drunk either, because she stopped and made sure Agatha was okay with this, that she consented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her body ached in a way that had nothing to do with discomfort and everything to do with the fact that she had finally let herself indulge in something that felt good. No hesitations, no second-guessing, just—good.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She almost smirked at herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then her gaze drifted toward the dresser.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That damn room key was still sitting right where she had left it, untouched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could picture Jen’s face, the way she had leaned against the doorframe, so smug when she offered it, like she was doing Agatha some huge favor. Like she was saving them from this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had known, the second Jen mentioned it, that she wasn’t going to take it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But seeing it there now, unused, felt like something else entirely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t sure what that feeling was yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She flexed her fingers against the sheets, resisting the urge to roll onto her back and stare at the ceiling. Instead, she carefully turned her head, slow and deliberate, just enough to see Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was still asleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Relaxed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The usual sharpness in her expression softened in the early morning light, mouth parted slightly, hair a mess against the pillow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her for a second longer than she probably should have.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then she turned away, exhaling quietly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Don’t think about it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wasn’t going to think about how little time they actually had before Rio left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wasn’t going to think about how fucking easy this had been, falling into bed with Rio. And that she was leaving after the wedding. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, she let her mind drift to what came next.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because they weren’t just here for this. This wasn’t some secret, stolen weekend in the middle of nowhere. There were plans. An itinerary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The spa.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Right.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And that meant Alice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had just slept with Jen’s sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then Rio shifted behind her, pulling her from her thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And she had no idea how this next part was going to go.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For so long, she thought Rio didn’t care about anything. That she floated through life unattached, unconcerned, too cool to be affected by anything or anyone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But that wasn’t true. Agatha had seen it firsthand. The way Rio cared—deeply—about certain things, certain people. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha can’t help but wonder if last night fell into one of those categories. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She can’t help but spiral. It’s in her nature. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because what if this never happens again?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>God, she hopes not.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She needed to do that again forever, if she could.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But what if Rio doesn’t want that? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No alcohol in their systems, no late-night haze to justify it. What if she just… moved on? Brushed it off? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Didn’t care? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Would she go tell Jen?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No. No, Rio wouldn’t do that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But still, Agatha’s stomach twisted as she braced herself, because Rio was waking up. And she’s not sure what she’s about to say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Morning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Soft. Sleepy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was not what she expected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then Rio’s arm tightened around her, just slightly, like she had no plans of letting go. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, about to say something—anything—but before she could, Rio’s voice came again, still rough with sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you mean it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tensed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her brain immediately scrambled, running through everything she could’ve possibly meant last night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Had she said something? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Had she been too open? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Had she—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had no idea what Rio was talking about.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So she hesitated. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That I made you come really hard last night?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face burned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Like she wasn’t currently naked in bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Like Rio wasn’t still holding her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Like they hadn’t already done everything there was to do.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her breath caught in her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And for once, she had no idea what to say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t trust her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why couldn’t she speak?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then Rio’s lips brushed against her shoulder, soft and teasing, and suddenly, not speaking wasn’t that big of a deal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Especially not when Rio started kissing down her back, slow and deliberate, like she had all the time in the world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Especially not when Rio pushed at her hip, urging her to roll onto her stomach, and Agatha did.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her brain was melting, her thoughts slipping through her fingers, unraveling with every press of Rio’s lips against her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her brain caught up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were at the spa resort.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With an itinerary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And a schedule.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With Alice. And </span>
<em>
<span>Jen. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha, who normally had everything under control, had absolutely no idea where they were supposed to be today. She hadn’t even bothered to check the schedule. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At Jen’s spa retreat - for her wedding. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha reached behind her, fingers tangling in Rio’s hair, tugging just enough to stop her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pulled away immediately, dark eyes flicking up to meet hers. “Did you want me to stop?” she asked, voice still rough with sleep, with something else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And finally—finally—Agatha spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” she said, voice embarrassingly breathless. “God, no.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, trying to pull herself together. “We just—we have something to do, don’t we? With Alice? And Jen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That smirk faltered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha suddenly hated that she brought it up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because as much as that smirk typically meant trouble from Rio, she hated to be the reason it fell from her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio glanced over at the clock and Agatha looked too - the red numbers flashing 5:27 AM at both of them. She huffed out a quiet laugh. “Pretty sure nothing is scheduled at a spa resort before eight,” she murmured, voice teasing. Then, tilting her head, she added, “So do you want me to continue? Or I can go shower, and we can get ready.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lost her voice again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So she nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk returned as she shifted, dipping her head down, starting at Agatha’s ankle and kissing her way up, slow and lazy, like she had all the time in the world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time she reached Agatha’s shoulder, Agatha could feel her smirk against her skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Thank God, the smirk was already back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think I’m gonna need to hear you say it, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha lost her voice again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Couldn’t find the words, couldn’t even think of them, because Rio’s hands were everywhere now—gliding over her sides, her chest, mapping her skin like she was something worth memorizing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Rio pressed closer, her body flush against Agatha’s, warm and solid and so much all at once, and Agatha was pretty sure she was going to combust if Rio didn’t do something right now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Rio just kept teasing, fingertips skimming but never really touching, mouth hovering but never quite landing, and then—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then she laughed. Soft. Hushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Right against Agatha’s ear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As if she wasn’t torturing her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agathaaaaaaa,” Rio drawled, voice low and raspy against her ear, sending a violent shiver down her spine. And then she felt Rio’s hand curving up the inside of her thigh and teeth, harsh and quick on her ear. “What happened to that dirty fucking mouth of yours, sweetheart?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha broke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The teasing, the touching, the biting—it was too much. She couldn’t take it anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she gasped, voice wrecked, raw with want. “Please—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pulled away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Completely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the loss instantly, cold air rushing in where Rio’s body had just been. She barely had time to process it before she turned and watched Rio slide out of bed, stretching her arms above her head like she hadn’t just ruined Agatha’s life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What the fuck?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you trust me?” Rio asked Agatha, her eyes not leaving Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice is too damn calm and Agatha freezes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because of course she trusts Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Was Rio not there last night? When her tongue was literally inside her? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why the fuck did she just get out of bed? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Rio moves - slow and steady - coming around the bed up towards Agatha. She stays still, face back down in the pillows when Rio starts moving. And then she hears Rio’s footsteps stop and she looks back up and she’s looking right at - </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her mouth waters. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t realize the bed was the perfect height for someone’s waist to be eye level if she’s laying down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha wasn’t looking at Rio’s waist. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She feels the heat on her neck before her eyes even catch the full picture of Rio standing in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Rio doesn’t give her time to process it. Instead, she feels two fingers on her chin and they’re lifting. Agatha has no choice but to look up at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t even have time to think about the view Rio has with her face gripped and looming over Agatha because Rio is continuing, “I asked you a question.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart kicks in her chest. She feels herself swallow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt like she had most of the control last night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, she </span>
<em>
<span>knows</span>
</em>
<span> she had most of the control last night, except when Rio had stopped and made sure Agatha was okay, Agatha held the power all night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But right now? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was taking control. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha, against her usual norm, because let’s be honest, she already slept with Rio, one more thing out of character wasn’t going to kill Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lets her - take control that is. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The thumb on her chin moves upwards and catches Agatha’s bottom lip, and before she lets herself think about anything else, “Yes.” The thumb pulls her lip down, “Of course I trust you, Rio.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiles, not a smirk, and lets go of her chin. Agatha lets her head fall back onto the pillow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Rio’s behind her, and she’s rustling through something in the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And truly, Agatha doesn’t know why the fuck Rio isn’t in this bed with her right now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because what the fuck is more important in the room right now than touching her? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hears a zipper, and oh - </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s grabbing it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The vibrator. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The one Rio found in her bag yesterday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The one Rio hadn’t teased her about. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The same one Rio has in </span>
<em>
<span>green</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She can’t help it, she turns and watches as Rio closes the bag, turning back towards the bed and then she’s looking at Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Agatha’s not looking at Rio, she’s watching her fingers curl around the vibrator - her vibrator - and thanking every deity in every religion that she told Rio </span>
<em>
<span>yes, she trusted her.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because Rio had the same one, in green. Which meant Rio knew how it worked. There wasn’t going to be fumbling or figuring out how to hold it - Rio had the same one in green. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio crawled up the bed towards Agatha, and Agatha turned back over, eager for whatever Rio was going to do next. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt the bed dip as Rio slid right behind her again, as if she hadn’t left the bed at all. Rio’s legs brushing against the one closest to her, hand trailing up her side and her breath against the back of her shoulder again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that okay, Agatha?”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And fuck - consent is sexy and all of that. And really, Agatha should be grateful Rio is being really considerate - has been really considerate this entire trip, actually. But if Rio doesn’t touch her, she is going to flip them over, pin Rio down and get herself off while Rio watches, because she can’t take it anymore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To get her feelings across, she reaches behind her head, searching for Rio’s hair again. When she finds Rio’s hair, she tangles her fingers in it up to her scalp and tugs. Hard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hears Rio gasp, and feels her fall forward flush against Agatha’s body. The hand on her side now grips her hip and she can feel blunt nails pressing into her skin. Rio’s breath is now in Agatha’s ear and she can hear it pick up in pace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Agatha hadn’t felt so needy for Rio to touch her, she’d let herself gloat a little at surprising Rio. But the throbbing between her legs was so intense, her thoughts were clouded with only the thought of Rio touching her. Right now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes. Now fuck me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She loosens the grip on Rio’s hair and as soon as she does, Rio doesn’t hesitate to dip her head down to Agatha’s neck. She feels sloppy, open mouth kisses on her skin and then the hand on her hip is moving up and under. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She feels Rio lift her up with her hand and Agatha helps, rolling her body towards Rio’s, giving her hand further access. Rio takes advantage of it right away, her hand palming at her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha needed more. She moves her hand from Rio’s hair, down and over Rio’s gripping at her fingers that were running over her chest and drags it over to her breast. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Luckily, Rio has some mercy in her, because she starts brushing her nipple with the tips of her fingers and finally, Agatha feels some relief. She sighs as Rio’s fingers tease, head lolling back against Rio’s shoulder, Rio’s lips still on Agatha’s neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She feels herself relax into Rio’s touch, body pushing further against Rio’s as if they weren’t glued to each other. Then Rio twists her fingers, pinching just a little and Agatha’s hips jolt backwards against her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She feels Rio smirk again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then her lips are pulling away from her neck and her hand is pulling off of Agatha’s chest. And then she feels Rio’s body moving off of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio really needs to stop pulling away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But before Agatha can say anything, Rio is sitting up and gripping at Agatha’s hips and twisting her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Manhandling her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s okay with that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She lets her body be moved, her arms moving up over her head as Rio gets her into whatever position she wants. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She ends up with her arms underneath the pillow below her, face in said pillow, and knees bent on the bed. She gasps at the cool air, her center now exposed to the AC of the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then lips are trailing down her back again and she fights every instinct in her body to not shy away from the hair tickling down her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her breath hitches in her throat when she feels hands running down her sides, stopping at the curve of her ass and then she whines - </span>
<em>
<span>whines</span>
</em>
<span> - when she feels Rio’s hands lift off her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The whine cuts short, though, because Rio’s hand makes contact again, this time with a smack and Agatha falls forward, further into the pillow, groaning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t let her stay there, gripping her hips and pulling her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stay.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And if Agatha wasn’t so turned on, dripping, desperate for Rio’s touch, she’d be sitting up. She’d twist her body towards Rio and press her against the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because she wasn’t a fucking dog. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t take commands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Agatha can feel herself clenching on nothing, and Rio had grabbed the vibrator from her bag. And Rio had wanted Agatha the next day. Sober. No makeup. Morning breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So Agatha bit her lip instead, not letting herself respond. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was going to be good. So Rio would touch her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio seems to want to wait to make sure Agatha isn’t moving. Agatha stays still. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Finally, she feels Rio shift behind her on the bed and with Agatha’s face in the pillow, she can’t see what she’s doing but she can only assume. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She can only hope. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Agatha feels a hand go across her back, over her hip and down. Then fingers are teasing at her, light circles right above where Agatha really needs it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she stays still, gasping into the pillow anytime Rio’s fingers dip down and brush her clit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s fucking torture. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She feels Rio shift on the bed, and then hair is brushing her back again at the same time fingers brush her clit. Agatha thinks she should get a fucking award for not moving. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A whispered, “Good.” Raspy, deep, intense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then the fingers are moving down, sliding through her folds, exploring. Agatha holds her breath as she stays still. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio keeps her hand there, moving backwards on the bed again, at least that’s what Agatha thinks based on the way the bed moves. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then the hand is pulling away, and Agatha’s not sure how much longer she can stay still. This was peak torture. She knows Rio knows this too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still, she fights every impulse to move as suddenly all touch is gone from her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then, she can tell Rio is directly behind her, based on the weight on the bed and she’s pressing a finger inside her from behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha barely even feels it, she’s so wet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Agatha. You’re so wet. Is this all for me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The one finger starts thrusting inside her, slow, deliberate and it’s not enough and it’s also perfect at the same time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Rio had asked her a question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So she pulls her head just away enough from the pillow so Rio can hear her, trying not to move against the finger inside her so Rio doesn’t stop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her voice comes out raspy, like Rio’s did earlier, “It’s all for you, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because that’s all she can give Rio without moving against the finger inside her. But Rio seems to appreciate that, just like she did last night because she can hear Rio let out a small groan and her hand starts to move faster. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha drops her head back into the pillow to let out a moan and the hand moving against her stops and is pulling out. Agatha clenches at the loss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And fuck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t move, she responded to Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was being good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So why did Rio stop? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then she feels Rio moving behind her, and the sheets moving as if Rio was looking for something. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then she hears it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The buzzing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Loud against the silence of the hotel room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sound moves behind her somewhere, she’s not sure where it is and she’s pretty sure Rio is going to try to surprise her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha braces herself for what’s coming. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s no use.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio drags the vibrator across her lower back and the moment the vibrator makes contact with her skin, her hips jut forward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gives her mercy this time, she doesn’t stop, just continues her path across, over and around her waist as Agatha collects herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s not going to move again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She won’t. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Finally, the vibrator makes contact with her clit and Agatha moans. Loud. Deep into the pillow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The pressure is light and she can already tell Rio has it on the lightest setting - Agatha’s very familiar with her own vibrator. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She feels Rio gather her hair on her back behind her, but she can’t focus on any other touch when Rio could be pressing harder on her or pressing the little button on the vibrator to speed it up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then Rio is pulling on her hair hard, and Agatha’s head has to follow at the force. It almost hurts, if Rio wasn’t making her feel so good in other places. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t stop pulling until Agatha’s lifted off the bed, her back pressed flush against Rio’s front again and they’re kneeling on the bed. It happened so fast, Agatha’s not sure how Rio kept the vibrator in the same spot as they moved together, but she did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She holds Agatha’s head against her shoulder as the hand on the vibrator starts to move, sliding it up and down her center. Agatha’s hips twitch at the change of pace on their own accord and she hopes Rio doesn’t notice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here’s what’s going to happen,” Rio starts. Agatha clenches on nothing. “You’re going to stay right here, and I want to hear every little sound out of your mouth. Do you understand?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s nodding as she responds, “Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hears a click and the buzzing becomes more intense, Rio’s hand stilling and holding it directly against her clit. She presses her body against Rio’s, and the grip in her hair moves towards her scalp. She remembers she’s not supposed to move and stills. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s not sure what to do with her hands, but she needs to grab something - anything. She reaches behind her head with one hand and grips Rio’s hair in return. Rio’s breath is now directly in the shell of Agatha’s ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her breaths are like pants, as if Agatha is the one fucking Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m going to let go of your hair, are you going to stay right here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha isn’t a fucking dog. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>We’ve covered this already. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Agatha is so close already, if Rio stops again, she’s pretty sure she’s going to cry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So Agatha doesn’t strike back with a snarky comment, she doesn’t move, no- she gives Rio what she wants.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, I’ll be good. Please just let me come.” The last part comes out breathy, a hint of the desperation she feels. The buzzing bringing her closer to the edge without Rio having to do anything except hold it exactly where it was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good.” She hears again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand releases her hair and Agatha stays, head resting against the front of Rio’s shoulder. That same hand now slowly trails up the front of her, and Agatha has to fight a shiver as she feels goosebumps prickle at her skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The hand doesn’t stop where Agatha thinks it should, which would be on her chest like before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, it continues upwards and again, doesn't stop where Agatha thinks it should, the next best spot. Her throat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, it continues, brushing underneath Agatha’s jaw and then, “Open.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her mouth drops open automatically. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t even realize her lips have parted. But then Rio’s soft touch quickly changes pace and two fingers are shoved roughly into her mouth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They press down on her tongue, just enough for Agatha to feel it, and then, “Suck.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha’s at Rio’s mercy. Completely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So she closes her mouth around the fingers and does what Rio tells her. Rio rewards Agatha by clicking the button again, this time at its highest speed. Agatha has to stop herself from biting down on the fingers in her mouth but she can’t stop her thighs shaking at the increase in speed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio either doesn’t seem to notice, or she doesn’t care that her legs are shaking - </span>
<em>
<span>thank God</span>
</em>
<span> - because she doesn’t stop. Instead she presses the vibrator up against Agatha just a little bit harder and then the fingers in her mouth start moving. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Slowly at first, just a little back and forth. Not pressing further or deeper, just a little out of her mouth and then back in. And while Agatha has never had fingers in her mouth and a vibrator on her clit all while on her knees, she's pretty sure this is going to be her new favorite for awhile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She loves hearing Rio right in her ear, her having complete control over Agatha and taking it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then she feels Rio thrusting her hips, just a little against the back of Agatha and she realizes Rio must be loving this as much as she does. So against all instincts to not move like Rio said, Agatha opens her mouth and takes Rio’s fingers deeper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She feels Rio’s thrusts falter for a second before picking up rhythm. Agatha almost smiles - well she would if fingers weren’t close to going down her throat. Because Rio doesn’t stop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The tightening in her stomach grows, and Agatha is so close. She can feel it in her toes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Rio’s fingers weren’t in her mouth, she’d be telling Rio to not stop. But she couldn’t. And she definitely wasn’t moving - she’s not risking Rio stopping now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio seems to know she’s close too, because she’s whispering in Agatha’s ear, “Are you close?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha can’t respond with the fingers in her mouth, so she nods her head, hoping it’s enough for Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Thank God it is. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I need you to come for me, Agatha. I need to feel you come with my fingers in your mouth. I want to feel your moans in my hand.” Rio whispers into her ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her words throw Agatha over the edge, the orgasm hitting her like an explosion. Her eyes slam shut as her body finally lets go, hips thrusting against the vibrator in Rio’s hand. Her body tries to fall forward, but Rio is holding her up, keeping her in position. The fingers stay moving on her tongue, but her mouth falls open and she’s moaning - okay almost shouting - against them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Through the waves of pleasure, she can hear Rio talking to her, but it's muffled as if her ears were ringing. She can feel something dripping on her chin, but she doesn’t care because Rio is keeping the vibrator exactly where Agatha needs it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Finally, she starts understanding Rio’s words, “- you’re doing so good. Fuck, you are so perfect Agatha, coming for me like this. I love watching you, you look so good for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And oh - Rio was talking her through it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Normally, at this point, Agatha is rolling over onto the bed and trying to come down from the high of an orgasm, but Rio’s hand is still on the vibrator and the other holding her head up - fingers still in mouth. And Agatha can’t squirm away from the direct contact with the grip the other woman has on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She can’t typically go again, but Rio talking her through it seems to be what was missing from that puzzle because by the time the first orgasm is tapering off, the second one was building in her abdomen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio catches on immediately. She pulls her fingers out of Agatha’s mouth and Agatha’s eyes peek open just long enough to see a trail of saliva following them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Was that from </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> mouth? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Must have been. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s thoughts stop though when the same fingers reach down and pinch and twist at her nipple. And the fingers were hot and wet from her mouth just a second ago. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha is thrown over the edge seemingly without warning this time. With nothing muffling the sounds of her mouth, she moans loud into the room. It wasn’t as long as the first one, but damn it was just as good. The pleasure shoots all the way down to her toes and she's pretty sure she blacks out for a second. <br/></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio finally releases her, removing the vibrator from her center and Agatha groans at the loss of contact. Not sure if she misses the vibrator or if she’s relieved it’s off of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha falls forward onto the bed, face directly into the pillow because </span>
<em>
<span>holy shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hears Rio behind her getting off the bed, and blindly reaches back trying to grab at her. Grab at something. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She catches one of Rio’s arms and she grips hard, stopping Rio from moving. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stops.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My turn.” </span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio stops moving at my turn. </p><p>Everythign in her stills - her hands, her breath. Just stops. </p><p>She moves, slowly - controlled, climbing back up the bed. She leaves a trail of kisses, starting at Agatha’s lower back, then her spine. She takes her time - letting Agatha catch her breath. When she gets to the dip just beneath her shoulder blade, she almost dies when Agatha lets out a soft sigh. Barely a sigh - but she’s caught her breath. </p><p>Agatha begins to turn underneath her, and she shifts, pulling back to give Agatha the space. </p><p>And then Agatha is underneath her - eyes at half mast, mouth parted, hair the perfect mess. Rio swears, if her knees weren’t already on the bed, stuck in between Agatha’s, they would be buckling. </p><p>Agatha’s looking up at her, her breath completely steady now, more focused almost. Her eye’s search around her face and then they lock onto Rio’s, biting her lower lip. </p><p>“I want you to come like this.” </p><p>Rio forgets how to breathe. </p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>Rio leans down and kisses her. Slow, deliberate. Lips sliding across each other, her tongue darting out just to lick at Agatha’s lip. </p><p>Agatha tastes like last night. </p><p>Rio fucking loves it. </p><p>She feels Agatha’s hands drift up her body, light at first, almost tickling. Then they’re on her ribs, around her waist, before it continues down, slow and careful. Teasing. </p><p>Rio’s hips jerk forward. She’s soaked - no -  dripping. Rio hasn’t stopped wanting her since last night. </p><p>And Agatha was touching her. </p><p>“Did I do this to you?” Agatha asks, sweetly, almost innocently. </p><p>But it almost comes out breathy too, like she liked this. </p><p>Rio nods, “It’s all from you.” </p><p>Agatha smiles up at her. Like she just got a prize. As if she doesn’t realize how hot she is - underneath Rio like this. As if she hadn’t just come in Rio’s arms not once but twice. </p><p>Then fingers press to her clit. Just like that. No warning. </p><p>Rio falls forward, arms buckling. She has to actively stop her hips from slamming down into Agatha’s hand. </p><p>Agatha’s fingers circle then, slow. Tight. Just the right amount of pressure. </p><p>Rio’s dying. Or she’s already dead. </p><p>Jury’s still out on that one.</p><p>And then - “I want to try something,” Agatha murmurs. Quiet. </p><p>And Rio would quite literally do nearly anything Agatha wanted to do. She’s not going to even ask what. Right now? Rio would beg. </p><p>Agatha uses her other hand, searching the bed, eyes still on Rio. Her other hand still between her legs. Still touching her.</p><p>Rio hears the rustle of sheets, digging through the cotton. It would be ridiculous if Agatha’s touch wasn’t so perfect. </p><p>And then Agatha’s hand found whatever she was looking for. </p><p>Rio feels the sheet tug down and Rio looks down - </p><p>Oh. </p><p>The vibrator. </p><p>The one she just used on Agatha. </p><p>That’s still glistening - just a bit - even in the dark of the hotel room. </p><p>She feels her mouth go dry. Her hips twitch forward on their own accord. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything. She starts dragging it down her own body, slow. Like a fucking show. </p><p>Rio can’t stop watching. </p><p>She trails it over her chest - brushing over a nipple, pebbling at the contact. Rio gulps. Then down her chest, over her stomach. Still a little wet. </p><p>Then she stops, right between her thighs. </p><p>And Rio wants it. Wants to do it just like this - how Agatha wants. </p><p>Agatha presses the toy to herself and Rio’s eyes snap up to hers - they’re dark.</p><p>”Come here,” Agatha murmurs.  </p><p>Rio’s nodding and moving forward. </p><p>Her movements are shaky but careful. She presses her hips forward until she’s right there - her own center against the vibrator, now pressed flush between them both. </p><p>Her breath catches at the contact. It’s not even on yet. </p><p>And then Agatha’s smile grows just a bit and she feels her hand twist beneath the. </p><p>Agatha presses the button. </p><p>The first vibration hits like a jolt. Deep - sharp. </p><p>Rio collapses onto her forearms immediately - one on each side of Agatha’s head. Their foreheads brush and Rio leans down to kiss her. </p><p>Rio feels Agatha smile into the kiss - the one that she fell into. </p><p>Normally, Rio isn’t so reactive - but she doesn’t care right now. Not with Agatha spread out underneath her like this.  </p><p>This position is too fucking good. Agatha flat on her back, her legs parted, body flushed and twitching. Their chests brushed with each breath. </p><p>Rio presses her hips forward, slow, careful - testing. </p><p>Her response is immediate. Agatha’s head falls back into the pillow, mouth dropping open in a sharp gasp. Her back arches up like she’s trying to chase the pressure. </p><p>The hand holding the vibrator drops and finds Rio’s hip. It grips hard. And then it’s pulling. </p><p>That’s all Rio needs. </p><p>She presses forward again, hips rolling tighter, and Agatha’s nails dig into her skin. She’s holding her there. Wanting more. </p><p>The sound that comes out of Agatha is breathy and raw. Rio nearly comes just from that. </p><p>Rio leans down, kisses her neck - soft at first, then rougher as her hips speed up. </p><p>She whispers into her skin, “Good?” </p><p>She’s still moving, grinding into her. Slow. Deep. </p><p>“Fuck yes,” Agatha gasps. “I love you fucking me like this.” </p><p>Rio’s brain stops. But her body responds, hips snapping harder and faster. She can’t help it. </p><p>Rio’s always focused on the other woman first. Always made sure it was about them. But Agatha - Agatha is so warm and wet and shaking underneath her and Rio had already made her come twice. Her body is still twitching with it. Still so fucking responsive. </p><p>And now she’s saying this. </p><p>Rio’s so fucking close. Her hips are moving faster - like she’s chasing something - more sounds from her. </p><p>Agatha’s moans are in her ear. Loud. Broken. Fucking perfect. </p><p>Rio bites her lip hard., trying not to let sound crawl out of her throat. She’s close. So close it almost hurts. </p><p>Then Agatha whispers, “Fuck, Rio, you’re gonna make me come again.” </p><p>And Rio almost loses it right there. Her body locks for a second - her body shuddering once. </p><p>She can’t let go yet. She won’t. Not until Agatha does. </p><p>She leans in closer, voice rougher than before, breathier than before, “you feel so good underneath me.” Her breathing is all over the place, but she pushes through it. “You’re doing so good. Taking it so good for me.” </p><p>Agatha arches into her, hand clawing at Rio’s back. </p><p>She feels it - when Agatha comes. Agatha’s body clenches around her, breath stuttering in Rio’s ear - like a broken sob. And yeah, that does something to her. </p><p>Rio doesn’t slow down. She can’t. She’s too far gone. Too close. She keeps grinding, hips tight and fast. </p><p>Then Agatha’s hand are on her face, pulling her up off her neck. Dragging her mouth back to hers. Rio follows - gasping. Their lips crash, wet and messy. </p><p>Rio’s right on the edge. </p><p>And then Agatha fists her hand in Rio’s hair at the base of her neck and yanks her back, just enough. </p><p>“Look at me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snap open. </p><p>Blue. </p><p>It’s all she sees. Wide and locked on hers. Agatha’s breath is warm against her mouth, open and panting.</p><p>”It’s okay,” she whispers. “Let go.” </p><p>Rio’s forehead nearly clanks into hers. She’s so close she’s shaking. </p><p>“Come for me, baby”</p><p>And that’s it. </p><p>She shatters. Hard. Her eyes locked on Agatha’s even when they start to blur. She hold them open, barely, because fuck - Agatha told her to. </p><p>She moans loud against her mouth. Gasps into her lips. Agatha bites down on her bottom lip, and that only pulls another sound - a groan — out of Rio’s throat. </p><p>Agatha breaks the eye contact first - just barely. Just as Rio’s breathing starts to steady again. </p><p>“Fuck, I love seeing you come for me,” Agatha says. </p><p>Rio groans, hips still rolling but slow, she’s sensitive. She feels raw. </p><p>And then Agatha’s hand is sliding down her back, gripping her hip hard. </p><p>“Keep going.”</p><p>Oh. </p><p>Agatha can go again?</p><p>Rio blinks. Because what the <em>actual fuck</em>. After that? But Agatha’s fingers tighten again - insistent on her hip. </p><p>Well, <em>fuck</em>. </p><p>Rio presses forward again. Fast. Even though she’s still trembling. Even though every nerve is lit up. It doesn’t matter. </p><p>She’d do it again and again if Agatha told her to. </p><p>She watches the way Agatha arches and her mouth falls open in a silent moan. </p><p>“Fuck, Rio - Rio I’m gonna come again.” She sounds breathy and desperate. “What the - what the fuck - what the fuck are you doing to me?”</p><p>Rio almost laughs. Almost. She’s too focused and turned on. </p><p>And maybe smug. Just a little bit. </p><p>Because she knows Agatha means that. Even if it's in the heat of the moment. </p><p>“I’m so close - fuck - just like that -“</p><p>
<strong>Knock knock. </strong>
</p><p>Rio’s hips stutter. Her head snaps up. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes are wild. Her grip on Rio’s hip locks tight like a vice. Her legs wrap around Rio’s waist. </p><p>“Don’t stop.” </p><p>It’s barely a whisper. </p><p>Who the hell is Rio to say no? </p><p>Rio picks up her pace again, and Agatha moans - moans way too loudly for someone at the door. </p><p>Panic flickers in her chest. </p><p>Her hand slices up Agatha’s body, palm flattening over her mouth before the next sound can escape. </p><p>“Okay?” She whispers. </p><p>She feels Agatha’s breath on her skin. Fast and shaky. She nods frantically, eyes half-lidded but wild. Desperate. </p><p>Another knock. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Rio presses further, both with her hips and her hand. The shift in pressure sends a jolt through Agatha’s body. She arches beneath her and a wrecked gasp against her palm. </p><p>Agatha’s coming. </p><p>She rocks her hips slower now, watching Agatha’s face twitch with every aftershock. Even muffled, she’s loud. So fucking loud. It’s insanely hot. </p><p><strong>Knock knock.</strong> </p><p>“Hey, Rio?”</p><p>Her whole body tenses. </p><p>Alice. </p><p><em>Shit</em>. </p><p>Rio watches Agatha’s eyes snap wide - like an owl. Like she just remembered where they were. </p><p>Rio’s heart stutters - she’s not sure why. She starts pulling away, “Don’t move.” </p><p>She pulls her palm from Agatha’s mouth and feels the ghost of the last moan still humming against it. </p><p>The knock again. </p><p>Rio yells back, “Coming - hold on, hold on,” and her voice is low and rough and out of breath. </p><p>She grabs the sheet fast, dragging it off the bed. She watches Agatha stretch out like a damn cat - the vibrator still resting in between her thighs. </p><p>And then Agatha - Agatha who doesn’t want Jen or Alice to know, says “Well I just was.” </p><p>And then snorts. Fucking <em>snorts</em>. </p><p>Rio lets out a small laugh. </p><p>Rio wraps the sheet around herself. She feels it stick to her back, damp with sweat. She doesn’t even glance in the mirror. She knows what she looks like - hair wrecked, lips swollen. </p><p>Whatever. </p><p>Alice won’t care. </p><p>She opens the door and peeks her head around. </p><p>And Rio was wrong.</p><p>Very wrong.</p><p>Alice grins so wide at the sight of her, Rio can see all of her teeth. Like, molars. </p><p>“What, Alice?” She says quickly, cutting her off. </p><p>Alice’s smile only widens - somehow. “Did I interrupt?”</p><p>Rio could be snarky. She could deflect or mess around like she usually does. But she won’t - not with Agatha in her bed and Alice standing in front of her for way too long of her liking. </p><p>She just repeats herself, sharper. “What, Alice” </p><p>Alice doesn’t even blink. Too busy sniffing out gossip - like a fucking bloodhound. “Is there someone in there with you?” Alice leans in, eyes glinting. “Is it the waitress from last night?”</p><p>She knows it’s loud enough for Agatha to hear. </p><p>Rio almost laughs. </p><p>Because the waitress definitely helped her get into the situation she currently is in. </p><p>“Something like that. What do you want?”</p><p>Alice beams, “Are you coming to the facial? You missed breakfast.”</p><p>Facial? </p><p>It takes Rio a full five second to process what the hell Alice is talking about. It can’t be that late. She just check the hotel clock - what, maybe an hour ago?</p><p>”Wait, what time is it?”</p><p>”10:15,” Alice says. “Our facials are at eleven.”</p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Rio blinks. Then she turns and looks toward the hotel clock and 5:27 is flashing back at her. Menacingly. </p><p>So yeah. Probably broken. </p><p>She rubs a hand over her face. “Yeah. Yeah, I’ll get ready now. Sorry for missing breakfast.”</p><p>Alice waves her off. “No problem!” She turns to leave and Rio lets out a breath but then Alice stops and turns back, “Hey, have you heard from Agatha? We’ve been looking for her since, like eight, but she hasn’t answered her door.”</p><p>Rio freezes. </p><p>Her breath caught in her throat. Stomach flipping. </p><p>Alice keeps talking, casual, like she didn’t just throw a grenade into the room. </p><p>“She hasn’t even texted us back. Jen thinks she went for a walk or something?” </p><p>Rio swallows and then clears her throat. ”Haven’t seen her,” she says. </p><p>“Okay! See you soon!” Alice turns and happily walks back towards the lobby of the hotel. </p><p> </p>

<p>So why the hell did she say, “Well, I just was” when Rio yelled that she was coming to open the door? </p><p>And then she snorted. </p><p>Snorted. </p><p>Great. Real smooth.</p><p>But Rio laughed. She actually laughed. That soft little scoff of hers. Not cold. Not annoyed. Just amused.</p><p>So maybe it wasn’t a full disaster.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>She watches Rio pull the sheet around herself and Agatha can already see where this is going to go. Alice is going to make a comment. No - multiple comments. Especially at Rio in a sheet. </p><p>Alice’s voice was too loud. It always was when she thought she was being clever.</p><p>And who would’ve guessed? Agatha was right. </p><p>Did I interrupt?</p><p>Agatha holds her breath - because Alice knows someone is in the room with Rio. And then she brought up the fucking waitress from last night. </p><p>Agatha feels pounding in her ears as she waits for Rio's response. </p><p>Something like that. </p><p>Rio didn’t say no.</p><p>She didn’t say yes either.</p><p>Which, to anyone else, might have passed as nothing. But not to Alice. </p><p>Agatha almost groaned aloud. Alice was going to hold onto that answer like a goddamn bulldog. Chew it. Drag it around. Wave it in the air until she finds out what Rio means. </p><p>Still. At least Alice didn’t think it was Agatha in the bed.</p><p>And maybe—just maybe—Alice would let it go.</p><p>She wouldn’t. Agatha knew her too well. </p><p>But Agatha can hope. </p><p>Then her stomach drops.</p><p>Just plummets at the sound of Alice’s voice saying she’s been looking for her.</p><p>Because—fuck.</p><p>She didn’t go back to her room last night. Didn’t even think about it after Jen gave her the key and left. </p><p>She stayed. All night. In Rio’s bed. So she didn’t answer her door when they were looking for her. </p><p>She grabs her phone off the nightstand and sure as shit - multiple missed calls and even more texts from the two of them. </p><p>But Rio—Rio—covered for her. Said nothing. Just played it cool with Alice standing right there. Wrapped in nothing but a damn sheet and still somehow keeping her cool.</p><p>So maybe it’ll be okay.</p><p>It has to be.</p><p>She exhales, long and shaky. And just as she starts to gather herself again, she hears Rio’s footsteps returning from the door.</p><p>And then it hits her.</p><p>The vibrator.</p><p>Still between her thighs. Still pressed there like some kind of threat or reminder or fucking branding iron. Her whole body jolts a little. She doesn’t move when Rio returns to view. </p><p>But Rio isn’t looking there.</p><p>She’s smiling.</p><p>Shy. Almost like she’s nervous, which is ridiculous because look at her. Hair messy. Sheet falling a little too low on one side. Still flushed and glowing and looking so fucking wrecked—and Agatha did that.</p><p>She did that.</p><p>She wants to take a picture with her brain and keep it forever.</p><p>And then Rio’s moving toward the bed, slow. Not hesitant. Just easy. She sits on the edge of the bed, one leg hanging off the side. One knee bending in toward Agatha like it’s instinct. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t breathe.</p><p>Then Rio leans down and kisses her.</p><p>Soft. Way too soft for what they just did, but it still makes her chest ache. Like there’s too much in it. Like the softness is more dangerous than everything before.</p><p>Her hand finds Agatha’s hair, fingers tangling gently near the side of her head.</p><p>And then she pulls back. Just a little. Just enough to look at her again.</p><p>Smiles.</p><p>That fucking smile again.</p><p>Shy. Like she doesn’t know how much power she has. Like she didn’t already leave Agatha shaking in bed when she went to answer the door. </p><p>Agatha swears under her breath and closes her eyes for a second.</p><p>She wants to pull her back down. Wants to climb on top of her and make her stay. Wants to forget facials and the itinerary and the broken fucking clock.</p><p>To be honest, Agatha’s not mad about the clock.</p><p>Not even a little bit. </p><p>She’d miss breakfast every single day if it meant she got that again.</p><p>She opens her eyes.</p><p>Rio’s still watching her.</p><p>That smile, soft and unassuming, like she’s still trying to figure Agatha out. </p><p>And fuck—Agatha’s smitten. Smitten like it’s a goddamn disease. </p><p>The kiss? Didn’t expect that. Didn’t expect it to be so damn good. So tender and real when she was already wrecked. She wants to push it back, to feel it again, but she can’t think straight.</p><p>She trails her fingers up Rio’s arm, just enough to feel the muscles beneath. She feels Rio shiver, the sheet dropping just a little lower, and Agatha’s mind races. She loves this. Loves the way Rio reacts. She can’t get enough of it.</p><p>She wants to see her shiver more. Wants to make her fall apart again. </p><p>But they have 45 minutes to be down in the lobby ready for facials. </p><p>She blinks, soft. Sweet. Letting her eyelashes brush her cheek in that teasing way she knows works. “Why don’t we shower together?” Her voice comes out soft, but scratchy - almost hurting her throat. </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shoot up to her forehead, and then she lets out a small laugh—like she doesn’t believe it. “You can really go again?”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>And Agatha freezes for just a moment. Her stomach flips. She didn’t want that. No.</p><p>She wants to touch Rio. She wants more time, just a few more minutes of this.</p><p>“I was thinking more like some aftercare showering,” Agatha says, trying to sound casual, but her voice catches at the end.</p><p>And then she regrets it. The words feel too soft, too intimate. Something she shouldn’t have said. It was too much.</p><p>She watches Rio carefully, waiting for the mask to fall, for that unreadable expression to break. And maybe it’s too much for her.</p><p>Then, after a beat—just one long breath—Rio smiles.</p><p>“As you wish.” Rio’s voice is steady, but full of tenderness. </p><p>Agatha’s heart flutters. Like she just got punched in the chest.</p><p>Rio gets up from the edge of the bed, the movement fluid, purposeful. She glances at Agatha before reaching down, her fingers curling around the vibrator, pulling it slowly to the side of the bed, leaving it there somewhere, out of sight. Not out of mind. </p><p>Her hand stretches out to Agatha, an invitation that feels more intimate than anything they’ve shared yet. Agatha looks at it for a moment, then places her own in Rio’s, feeling the softness of her touch, the care in it.</p><p>When she stands, her knees almost buckle under her, the sudden reminder of everything they just did hitting her like a jolt of electricity. She steadies herself, trying to ignore the flood of warmth and tension that rushes back to her all at once. But Rio’s there, holding her steady, her arm wrapping around Agatha’s waist, guiding her like it’s second nature.</p><p>Rio doesn’t let go. She leads Agatha through the room, toward the bathroom. The soft click of the bathroom door feels like a moment of peace in the chaos of their night, like they can finally breathe again.</p><p>Rio grabs one of the thick towels from the rack, folding it before setting it down on the toilet seat with a gentle press. “So it’s not so cold,” Rio says, her voice low, thoughtful. The words are simple, but they mean more than they should.</p><p>Agatha sits down carefully, feeling the softness of the towel beneath her, and the way Rio’s gaze lingers on her with that tenderness that feels too good, too right. The moment stretches between them—quiet, almost sacred.</p><p>It’s Rio taking care of her. It’s Rio, showing her something she never expected: softness. The softness that was always there, just hidden beneath layers of quick wit and guarded expressions. And in this moment, Agatha can’t help but feel… cared for.</p><p>Agatha tilts her head slightly, meeting Rio’s gaze, searching for something. She’s not sure what yet. </p><p>But Rio’s gaze doesn’t waver, doesn’t leave her. Instead, it stays there, steady, watching Agatha as if she’s something worth watching.</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha whispers, the words barely there, but Rio catches them.</p><p>Rio simply smiles. “Of course,” she says, and the tenderness in her tone makes Agatha’s heart trip over itself again.</p><p>What the fuck is Rio doing to her?</p><p>Rio breaks eye contact first. It’s subtle, like she doesn’t want to—but she does. She turns, crossing to the massive shower, and Agatha lets herself follow every movement. The way Rio’s back shifts as she leans forward. The way her hair—messy from sex, wild and untamed—falls across her shoulders.</p><p>The spa bathroom is even more stunning now, bathed in soft morning light. The shower is ridiculous—walls of glass, multiple jets, polished tile that gleams. A rainfall head sits high above, already misting steam across the room. It’s the kind of shower rich people probably brag about. Big enough that she and Rio could fit in it six times over and still not touch.</p><p>Agatha watches Rio test the water, her fingers dipping in, adjusting the temperature with focus like she’s making it just right for her. And then Rio’s turning back, hand out again, waiting.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t hesitate. She reaches for it and lets herself be pulled gently to her feet. She’s still a little shaky, but not like before. The tremble is less about her legs now and more about what it means—this. Being guided. Being cared for.</p><p>She’s led slowly into the shower, and it’s all soft—her steps, Rio’s touch, the warmth from the steam. None of it was what she expected when she asked to shower together. </p><p>But it’s exactly what she wanted. </p><p>Like Rio knew exactly what to do for her. </p><p>The heat wraps around her as soon as she steps inside, water running down her body. She closes her eyes for a second. Lets it sink into her. And then she hears it—Rio’s voice. </p><p>Low, that same goddamn tone from earlier. “Good?”</p><p>Agatha opens her eyes and turns slightly, peering through the fogging glass at her. “Very,” she answers. </p><p>Rio beams. Actually beams. “Okay, I’ll be right back. I packed my own soap. Did you? I’ll grab it for you.”</p><p>Agatha nods, still a little stunned by how sweet she’s being. “Yeah, it’s in my bag. Thank you.”</p><p>Her bottom lip pulls between her teeth, and she smiles without meaning to. Soft. Sweet. Shy. She’s not used to feeling that way, but Rio draws it out of her without even trying.</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” Rio repeats, voice playful this time.</p><p>And she is. Like thirty seconds later. Agatha doesn’t even hear her come back in—not over the rush of the water above her. But she feels it.</p><p>Featherlight fingers on one shoulder. Lips brushing the other. It makes her grin. She starts to turn around, ready to pull Rio in against her, but she doesn’t make it far before she hears her voice again.</p><p>“I thought you wanted me to take care of you.”</p><p>It stops her. Rio’s tone is soft. Intentional.</p><p>Agatha did. Still does. She wants Rio’s body against hers, yes, but more than that, she wants this.</p><p>Before she can say anything, Rio moves closer, and her hands are in Agatha’s hair. Fingers threading through, gentle but firm. Massaging at her scalp like it’s a ritual. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flutter closed. She doesn’t speak. She doesn’t have to.</p><p>She lets Rio scrub at her hair. Really lets her. Tilts her head just enough to give her access, lets her fingers sink into the mess of curls and tangles and tension. And it’s.. </p><p>Fuck it’s intimate. </p><p>More intimate than anything she thought she’d get from Rio. More than anything she’s had in years. Even with Wanda. </p><p>Especially with Wanda.</p><p>But it’s also so simple. So quiet. So fucking perfect.</p><p>Rio’s not just going through the motions—she knows exactly what she’s doing. Exactly how to tame the stubborn, impossible mane that Agatha’s fought with her whole life. Like she’s done this before. Like she wants to do this. Like it means something to her, too.</p><p>And Agatha can’t help it. She melts under the touch. Relaxes into it fully.</p><p>Then Rio massages the conditioner into the ends of her hair, slow and gentle, and she shifts Agatha’s body to face her. Her hands don’t leave her. She just rotates her by the hips, keeping her close the whole time.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flutter open.</p><p>And Rio is looking at her. Really looking. Her gaze starts at her body, like she can’t help it, but when Agatha meets her eyes, Rio’s jump up immediately. And there it is again—that shy smile. Like she’s been caught. </p><p>Agatha’s hooked on it. Addicted to the way Rio looks at her like this. Like she wants her. </p><p>Rio’s hands are warm on her sides. Holding her there. Not gripping. Not teasing. Just holding.</p><p>Agatha can’t take it anymore.</p><p>She lets her hands wander up Rio’s body, slow, soaking in every inch of skin she can feel until she’s looping them around her neck. She pulls her in, can’t stop herself, and presses their mouths together.</p><p>Rio gasps against her lips.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Agatha kisses her harder, tugging her forward into the shower stream until water pours over both of them. Her own back is now out of the spray, but she doesn’t care. They’re pressed together nearly everywhere. </p><p>Rio’s kissing her back. Desperate now. Letting out the softest, most ruined noises against her mouth, and it’s enough to make Agatha’s whole body light up again. She’s suddenly aware of how fast her own breath is coming, how ragged it sounds in the humid air.</p><p>She should slow down. </p><p>They have facials. </p><p>But not yet.</p><p>Not when Rio tastes like this. </p><p>To Agatha’s surprise (yes- okay, Agatha is surprised at almost every move Rio makes) Rio pulls back.</p><p>Agatha blinks, lips still parted, heart still pounding. The warmth of Rio’s body still pressed close, the water still running over both of them—but Rio’s mouth is gone. Her eyes are shut. And her head is tilted back like she’s trying to get herself under control.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything.</p><p>She waits.</p><p>Because Rio’s been patient with her. Careful. Gentle when Agatha didn’t even realize she needed gentleness. So she lets her have the moment.</p><p>Then Rio’s eyes open again. Her head drops forward, and she takes in a long, steadying breath.</p><p>“As much as I’d love for that to keep going,” Rio says, voice low, hoarse from everything they just did, “we have a facial. And we need to leave at different times to meet in the lobby.”</p><p>Fuck. She’s right.</p><p>Agatha exhales, slow, but it doesn’t stop the way her lips pull into a pout. She knows she’s being ridiculous about it but still. </p><p>To her count, Rio’s up four this morning. And she’s only up one. That’s a math problem she doesn’t like the answer to.</p><p>She wants to give Rio more.</p><p>But then—another surprise.</p><p>“If you really want,” Rio adds, softer now, almost like she’s afraid to say it, “you can return the favor later. We don’t have to talk about it right now. I’m not trying to ruin the moment. But if you want to do it again… even when we’re back in Westview…” Her voice lowers even more. “I’d like to, too.”</p><p>Agatha freezes.</p><p>Her mouth falls open, a breath catching in her throat.</p><p>What?</p><p>She hadn’t expected that. Not at all. Of course she wanted to do it again. But she figured Rio was the type for one night only. </p><p>But once again, Agatha was wrong.</p><p>So fucking wrong.</p><p>Because Rio’s looking at her like it meant something. She’s been nothing but soft and tender and understanding since last night. </p><p>And she wants more?</p><p>Agatha realizes she probably looks like a gaping fish. Her mouth is still open. No thoughts in her brain, just the stunned fluttering of her pulse.</p><p>But eventually, she finds it—she reels it in, closes her mouth, and lets it pull into a smile.</p><p>Soft. A little shy. One that mirrors the one she saw on Rio earlier.</p><p>“Yeah,” she says, voice quiet. “That… that sounds good.”</p><p>And Rio beams at her. Not smug, not cocky—sweet. Sweet in a way that makes Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>“Your turn then,” Agatha says quietly. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t want to break the moment—</p><p>God, she doesn’t—but they have a facial. With Jen. And Alice. </p><p>And fuck. </p><p>She still hasn’t texted them back.</p><p>What is wrong with her?</p><p>She pushes the thought down. Buries it under the steam and the sound of water hitting tile and the way Rio makes this tiny little noise when Agatha starts washing her hair. Agatha’s addicted to it. That sound. She wants to memorize it, catalog every pitch and hum Rio makes.</p><p>Then Rio turns, reaching behind her somewhere, grabbing a washcloth.</p><p>Her voice is soft when she asks, “Can I wash you?”</p><p>And yes. Yes. Even if it kills Agatha, she wants Rio’s hands on her again. Wants that softness. That care. That ridiculous, perfect tenderness that’s been unraveling her since last night.</p><p>So she nods. A breathy, “Yes.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t rush. She starts at Agatha’s shoulders, the cloth warm and slow as it drags over her skin. Every stroke is deliberate, like she wants to get it right. Agatha watches the motion of her hand—how careful it is. How reverent.</p><p>She can’t believe this is happening. That Rio is the one doing this. That it’s this gentle, this grounding.</p><p>Then she feels a nudge at her knee. Rio taps her leg lightly with her own, not even needing to say anything.</p><p>Agatha parts her legs.</p><p>Her heart skips. </p><p>And Rio’s hand moves lower.</p><p>The first stroke is featherlight. Almost not there. But Agatha feels it. All of it. Because she’s still sensitive. Still raw from earlier. From everything.</p><p>Rio is soft. Devastatingly soft. Her touch is slow, careful, focused—never rushing, never teasing. Just… there.</p><p>Then pressure. Just the right amount. Her cloth-covered fingers press against Agatha’s clit, a deliberate, slow circle that has Agatha gasping.</p><p>Her hands scramble for something—anything—to hold onto. They land on Rio’s shoulder. Gripping hard.</p><p>Her knees nearly buckle again, the heat rushing through her so fast, it makes her lightheaded.</p><p>She collapses forward, her forehead landing against Rio’s bare shoulder.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>It feels too good. Too overwhelming. She feels it all the way up her spine, up into her throat. Her lips part, breath catching, but there’s no sound—just the deep throb of want pulsing through her with every stroke of Rio’s hand.</p><p>How the fuck does a washcloth do it for her?</p><p>“The facial—”</p><p>The words barely leave Agatha’s mouth before she gasps, her breath hitching as Rio’s pace picks up.</p><p>Agatha would like to repeat this: How the hell does a washcloth feel this good?</p><p>“We have to—we have to leave soon,” she tries, but the protest dies on her tongue the second Rio presses her back against the shower wall.</p><p>The cold tile hits her spine and she gasps again. It’s sharp. Perfect. Addicting.</p><p>Her legs tremble, and she has to brace her palms flat against the slick tile behind her to stay upright.</p><p>“What happened to - fuck - what happened to leaving at different times?” Agatha’s gasping. </p><p>Rio’s thigh slips between her legs and she’s grinding up into her just a little bit. “You’re driving me fucking crazy.” </p><p>Agatha’s head hits the tile wall with a a thud. And fuck that hurts.</p><p>And then she’s processing what Rio says. </p><p>“Fuck - really? What about the spa thing?” </p><p>“Do you want me to stop?” Rio asks, maddeningly calm.</p><p>And Agatha, panting, unraveling, desperate says, “Fuck—yes.”</p><p>So Rio stops.</p><p>Of course she stops.</p><p>But the second her fingers still, Agatha’s hand shoots out, grabbing her wrist, nails digging in just enough to hold her there. “No, no. Keep going.”</p><p>Rio chuckles low against her, the sound vibrating through Agatha’s whole body. “What is it, Agatha? Tell me.”</p><p>And of course Rio’s making her talk again.</p><p>Agatha’s head drops back against the tile. She closes her eyes, lips parted. She breathes.</p><p>Fine. </p><p>Fine.</p><p>“Make me come, Rio.”</p><p>And God, the effect those words have because Rio doesn’t hesitate. Her hand moves again, faster now. Firmer. The pressure is just right. Over and over and over again.</p><p>Agatha’s twitching, moaning, her thighs shaking like they’re about to give out. She’s gripping onto Rio’s shoulder again with one hand, the other sliding against the wall, desperate for stability.</p><p>She knows she’s being loud—knows her gasps and curses are echoing off the walls of this massive spa bathroom—but she doesn’t care. Not even a little.</p><p>It’s so fucking good.</p><p>And Rio’s watching her. She knows she is. Just watching her fall apart.</p><p>Rio says, “Come for me,” then leans down and bites and sucks at her neck.</p><p>Agatha does—with a gasp and a yell of her name.</p><p>It’s not super intense or long - but it's so good. </p><p>And then Rio pulls back, just slightly. Agatha can’t open her eyes yet, can barely remember how to breathe, but she feels the washcloth again—the one Rio just fucked her with. It’s moving up and down her skin, slow, steady. She’s pretty sure Rio rinsed it first. She’s almost certain. Not that it matters. The touch is so soft, so deliberate, she wouldn’t care if it was dipped in fire.</p><p>The cloth runs down her calf, a final swipe over her ankle, and then Rio backs away. When Agatha finally opens her eyes, Rio’s kneeling in front of her beneath the spray of the shower, eyes dark and locked on hers.</p><p>It’s breathtaking.</p><p>Then Rio grins up at her, stands up and pulls her into a kiss. Agatha melts into it without thinking.</p><p>“I’m gonna scrub really fast, and then we need to go,” Rio murmurs.</p><p>Oh. Right. </p><p>Right.</p><p>Agatha nods, a little dazed, and pulls her up by the hand. They switch places, Rio stepping under the water now. Agatha leans back into the spray, tipping her head so the water cascades down her face. She’s trying to focus. Really. But then—</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, you’re so beautiful.”</p><p>“Yeah?” It comes out shy and quiet. Because that’s all Agatha can come up with because Rio just keeps fucking surprising her. </p><p>Rio’s hands grip at her waist and turn Agatha towards her. Agatha wipes at her eyes and opens them to meet brown looking back at her. </p><p>“It’s driving me fucking crazy, Agatha. You’re so fucking beautiful. I can’t even wash your body completely before I need to touch you again.” </p><p>Agatha can tell Rio’s telling the truth. She’s not sure how she can tell, she just does. Agatha never takes compliments well so instead of responding, she pulls Rio into another kiss. </p><p>Rio bites her lower lip and a fucking giggle leaves Agatha’s lips. </p><p>What the fuck is Rio doing to her? </p><p>Has Agatha asked that already? </p><p>Whatever. </p><p>Before she knows it, they’re out of the shower and rushing to get ready. Agatha stands in front of the mirror, towel wrapped tight, staring at the mark blooming dark on her neck.</p><p>She already yelled at Rio for it. Kind of. Not really. More of a “Seriously?” while grabbing for concealer.</p><p>She layers makeup over it, prays she can sit on the opposite side of Alice and Jen during the facial. She’ll make it happen. She has to.</p><p>Rio just shrugs, towel around her waist. “Didn’t mean to.”</p><p>They come up with a quick plan. Agatha will come in from the opposite end of the hotel technically where her real room is. She nearly forgets her key card until Rio tosses it to her.</p><p>She’s not grabbing the rest of her stuff. She’s not going back to that room. Not really.</p><p>Agatha grabs her phone and texts Alice and Jen:</p><p align="right">
<strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p align="right">sorry went on a walk, left my phone! be right there.</p><p> </p><p>It’s 10:54 when she makes it to the other side of the lobby.</p><p>Rio and Jen and Alice are already there, leaning against the wall near the spa check-in, robes slung over their arms.</p><p>“So both of you skipped breakfast, huh?” Alice asks, arching a brow.</p><p>Of course Alice would say something. Immediately. </p><p>Agatha recovers fast. She has to. “Sorry, Billy called early this morning and then Wanda got on the phone with me and just… put me in a shit mood. I walked it off. I didn’t mean to miss breakfast. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Jen’s already shaking her head, all concern and warmth. “Of course not, babe! We were just worried. Want to talk about it?”</p><p>God, no.</p><p>She’s not going to dig herself into a deeper hole with a lie. </p><p>“No, it’s okay. I don’t wanna ruin our time together!” A little too enthusiastic. A little too much. Rio’s eyes catch hers, and they glint. </p><p>Then Alice turns, sharp as ever. “And Rio, pray tell, why were you not at breakfast?”</p><p>That bitch. </p><p>Agatha’s smile almost drops.</p><p>Almost. </p><p>What the hell is Rio going to say?</p><p>Rio just shrugs, that smirk curling onto her lips like it lives there. She snaps her gum. When the fuck did Rio get gum?</p><p>“Wouldn’t you like to know, gorgeous?”</p><p>The gum shifts between her teeth and Agatha watches it, way too closely. Jesus. Is she still this fucking horny?</p><p>Yes. Apparently yes. Because every little thing Rio does is hot. </p><p>Every. Little. Thing.</p><p>Hot. </p><p>Alice doesn’t blink. “Well we both know when I knocked on your door, you had someone in there with you.”</p><p>And Agatha nearly chokes on air.</p><p>She should’ve known Alice would go straight for the kill. </p><p>It’s annoying. </p><p>It’s so her. </p><p>If Agatha wasn’t worried about Jen and Alice figuring it out - she’d be amused at Alice’s insistence. </p><p>Rio snaps her gum in response. </p><p>“Please Riooo, just tell us, was it the waitress?” Alice is nearly whining. </p><p>“And I already told you. It was something like that,” Rio says, unbothered, like she’s commenting on the weather.</p><p>Before Alice or Jen can fire off a single follow-up, Agatha cuts in. </p><p>“Let’s go get our facials!”</p><p>She’s already walking into the spa room, fast. Not quite a jog. But close.</p><p>Cowardly? Maybe. But she doesn’t want that conversation to keep going. </p><p>The spa room is quiet and clean and dim. The kind of place that should make her relax. Instead, Agatha is calculating seating like it’s a goddamn battle strategy.</p><p>She clocks the layout: four tables lined up in a row. She picks the one on the farthest end—because when she lays down her hickey will be towards the wall. </p><p>She lies down, careful with the angle of her head, chin tilted slightly to keep the mark Rio left out of view. The hickey that she’s still low-key furious about. Even if she did scream Rio’s name at the time.</p><p>Jen takes the table beside her. Then Alice. And finally, Rio settles in on the opposite end.</p><p>Perfect. Bullet dodged.</p><p>Until Alice pipes up. “Actually… can we switch?” She’s already halfway upright, gesturing to Agatha. “I like being away from the door. It’s an intruder thing. I saw something on the news.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her.</p><p>That’s a bullshit excuse. Alice doesn’t even lock her front door half the time. But her tone is light and breezy, like it’s just a weird preference, not a strategic fucking move.</p><p>And Alice doesn’t know anything. Right?</p><p>Well, she knows Agatha’s into Rio. Maybe that’s why. Trying to push them closer together. </p><p>She’s not overthinking this anymore. </p><p>Agatha sighs. “Fine.”</p><p>They switch. Which now puts her directly next to Rio. Of course. And Jen. <br/><br/>Agatha lies back down, skin prickling with nerves. The hickey is still on her neck, and now she’s beside Jen, the most observant human being alive. If anyone’s going to notice a slip in concealer, it’s her.</p><p>She keeps her face forward. She lets the aesthetician start the facial. Soft music plays. Oil brushes against her skin. And thank god, Jen doesn’t say a word.</p><p>Not even a subtle hum.</p><p>Rio, for her part, is surprisingly silent. Not a single quip. No gum. No snark. Just… quiet. Every once in a while, Agatha risks a glance sideways. And Rio’s already looking.</p><p>Soft smile. Almost shy.</p><p>Just for Agatha. </p><p>She could melt. </p><p>They finish and head to lunch—again in the hotel restaurant. Familiar white tablecloths, the same seats, same clink of silverware. Agatha doesn’t think much of it until she appears.</p><p>The waitress from last night.</p><p>Does the woman ever leave?</p><p>Agatha practically feels the mark on her neck pulse. But she slides into the seat beside Rio before the panic settles in too hard, pulling her hair over her neck. </p><p>Jen didn’t mention it during the facial. Which means she didn’t see it. She would’ve said something. Jen always does.</p><p>They start ordering drinks, and—of course—the waitress zeroes in on Rio like she’s a dessert special.</p><p>But then she says it.</p><p>“Where did you disappear to last night? I was hoping to grab your number.”</p><p>Agatha freezes.</p><p>It’s innocent. Really. But her eyes snap to the waitress’s face like a reflex.</p><p>And then worse—Alice.</p><p>Alice’s grin is a goddamn weapon. Smug. Knowing. She had asked this morning if Rio had someone in her room. She’d joked that it was the waitress.</p><p>And Rio hadn’t said no.</p><p>Something like that. </p><p>Which, to Alice, was as good as confirmation.</p><p>Which means Alice is going to jump to every single conclusion until she gets her answer. </p><p>Agatha watches Alice’s eyes flick between Agatha and Rio like she’s watching a slow-burn TV drama finally heat up. Agatha leans on her elbow, resting her chin in her hand like she’s totally chill. Like her stomach isn’t trying to launch itself into orbit.</p><p>Alice is watching her. So is the waitress. And Jen is right there.</p><p>Agatha takes a slow sip of water.</p><p>“Just vanished on me,” the waitress adds, still smiling at Rio.</p><p>Rio doesn’t smirk. Doesn’t flirt. She just shrugs. “Long day.”</p><p>And Agatha feels the smallest brush of fingers against her knee—under the table, out of sight.</p><p>She doesn’t look over.</p><p>But her heart spikes anyway.</p><p>Rio’s not even entertaining her. </p><p>That makes Agatha want to smile and pull her into a kiss and fuck her on the table. </p><p>She won’t. Probably. </p><p>Agatha’s pulled from her thoughts as Jen excuses herself, her phone buzzing sharply. “Ralph, I’ll take the Kale salad,” she says, already standing. “Be right back, girls.”</p><p>Rio snickers under her breath. “Kale salad. You know cannibalism isn’t just frowned upon, it’s illegal.”</p><p>Jen shoos her off with a roll of her eyes. “Shut up Rio.”</p><p>All of them laugh lightly at the joke. </p><p>And Jen’s not even getting wound up by Rio’s teasing. </p><p>What a turn of events. </p><p>Agatha watches Jen as she walks away, eyes glued to her every step. The moment Jen disappears from sight, Agatha slowly turns her head, and that’s when she feels it—Alice’s eyes on her, gleaming, burning with something that’s more than curiosity.</p><p>Rio’s not looking at either of them, keeping her gaze fixed anywhere but on them. But Agatha can still feel Rio’s fingers brushing against her knee, soft, tentative, as if she’s testing the waters. </p><p>She turns to Alice, leaning in slightly, her voice low and sharp. “Spit it out, Alice.”</p><p>Alice’s fake surprise is almost sickeningly sweet. “Moi? Oh, it’s nothing. I just think it’s interesting that both of you missed breakfast this morning, and when I was talking with Rio earlier this morning, at her room—well, she was definitely in the middle of something - or maybe someone. Hmm. Makes you think.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart lurches. She turns to Rio, just a quick glance, but it’s enough. A flash of discomfort crosses her face—hurt? Agatha can’t tell. And she can’t bear it. Not after everything that happened this morning.</p><p>Alice really shouldn’t know. If she does, everything could spiral out of control in the worst way. It could fuck everything up. </p><p>But Rio’s silent, allowing Agatha to decide where this goes. Rio’s fingers are still on her knee, but they’ve stopped moving. Waiting.</p><p>Agatha swallows, her chest tight. She knows the right thing would be to deflect. But she can’t. Not this time.</p><p>She leans forward, her voice steady despite the anxiety creeping up her spine. “Fine. Yes, we slept together. Is that what you wanted to hear?”</p><p>She sees Rio’s face jerk upward, wide-eyed, shocked. The fingers on her knee tighten into a grip, but Rio stays silent. Agatha doesn’t pull away. She holds the gaze—feels her heart pounding in her chest. Rio doesn’t say a word.</p><p>Alice beams, her grin widening like she’s just won a prize. “Wow, I didn’t think it’d be that easy to pull that out of you.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond. The air around them feels heavy now, tight with unspoken things. She knows what this means. She knows what it could do. If Jen finds out… If Alice runs her mouth…</p><p>The thought of Jen’s face when she finds out burns in Agatha’s gut.</p><p>But Alice—Alice is fucking relentless. “Look, I won’t tell Jen or anyone for that matter. But—” She leans in, her voice suddenly dropping to a mock-serious whisper. “Did you use protection? Because I’m sure Rio’s dick—”</p><p>And before she can finish, Agatha’s napkin is in her hand, flying across the table, landing with a small poof against Alice’s face.</p><p>Alice laughs, her voice loud and unabashed, clearly not bothered in the slightest by the napkin Agatha threw at her. Agatha’s gaze hardens, but she doesn’t say anything, feeling the weight of the moment settle in her chest. Jen’s voice interrupts the tension as she walks back toward the table, phone still pressed to her ear.</p><p>“…Ralph and the wedding details, of course,” Jen’s voice is a steady background hum that Agatha tries to tune out. She doesn’t mean to, but she can’t help it. Not when Rio’s fingers slide further up her knee again, warm, deliberate. Agatha’s pulse quickens, and she can’t focus on Jen anymore. It’s all too much.</p><p>Rio smirks at them both, continuing the conversation as if everything is normal, as if she’s not torturing Agatha with every soft, calculated touch. Every time Rio’s fingers shift, Agatha can feel her breathing catch. The smirk is all teasing now, but there’s a quiet intensity behind Rio’s eyes, and Agatha’s heart is hammering.</p><p>The rest of lunch is a blur. They depart around 1, and it’s time to head back to the hotel, pack up, and clear out of the rooms by 2. Agatha watches Jen and Alice leave the restaurant, but she lingers, telling them she needed to use the restroom. Once they’re out of sight, her feet take her slowly around the corner of the lobby, but she’s not going to the bathroom.</p><p>She’s waiting.</p><p>She can feel the tension in the air before she even turns the corner. And then it happens.</p><p>Rio is there. The moment Agatha rounds the corner, Rio’s hand is around her wrist, yanking her effortlessly against the wall. Agatha gasps, her body pinned between the cool marble and the heat of Rio’s body. Before she can speak, a kiss is crashing against her lips, demanding, hungry, like Rio can’t hold back any longer.</p><p>“What was that, huh?” Rio’s voice is rough against her lips as she pulls back just slightly, eyes flicking down to Agatha’s mouth before looking into her eyes with a smirk. “What happened to ‘it’s a secret?’”</p><p>Agatha moans against Rio’s lips, her breath catching. She’s very aware of how public this is—how anyone could walk by, could see them—but she doesn’t care. Not now. Not when Rio’s hands are sliding against her skin with such ease, making her lose herself.</p><p>“I just—” Agatha looks down, her fingers absently playing with the necklace around Rio’s throat, not even realizing the gesture. “You looked uncomfortable hiding,” she admits quietly, her voice thick with emotion. “And I’m serious, Rio—Jen cannot know. But Alice won’t tell her, and maybe it’s a good thing, right? Alice is still hooked on her plan to dismantle the wedding. She’s been texting me about it since dinner last night. Not that I’ve responded to any of those texts yet.” Agatha walks fingers up Rio’s chest. S</p><p>Rio’s eyes never leave hers. Soft, attentive, like Agatha’s saying something important—something precious. It makes her heart flutter in a way she can’t quite explain.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” Rio says, her voice gentle but firm. It’s the only answer she gives before she pulls away, taking a step back and leading Agatha back toward their room.</p><p>“Okay?” </p><p>Rio turns back and smirks, “As you wish.”</p><p>Agatha follows, heart still racing, the kiss still burning in her chest. Halfway through the hallway, Rio reaches back and grabs her hand, and Agatha loops her other arm around, pulling herself closer. They walk like that, hand-in-hand, bodies brushing. </p><p>If Agatha saw another couple like this—touching, practically clinging to one another like lovesick fools—she’d roll her eyes, gag at the sheer sweetness of it all. But right now, in this moment, she doesn’t care.</p><p>She’s with Rio. And Rio’s smiling at her, that small, knowing smile that makes Agatha want to forget everything else.</p><p>They’re going to keep doing this. Whatever this is. </p><p>At least until Rio leaves. </p><p>Fuck. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>They spend the entire hour between lunch and when they need to check out <em>not</em> packing.</p><p>Or at least, that’s how it feels. Agatha keeps cornering her. Every time Rio reaches for something, there’s a hand on her hip, or teeth grazing her jaw, or Agatha’s mouth crashing into hers like they’re sixteen and grounded and making the most of ten stolen minutes before someone walks in.</p><p>Rio doesn’t do this. Not with women. But Agatha? Agatha doesn’t even ask. She just keeps kissing her. And Rio lets her.</p><p>Because Agatha told Alice.</p><p>She said it out loud, like Rio’s emo-ass expression gave her no choice. “We slept together.” Just casual. Like it wasn’t the reason Rio had almost knocked over her water glass. Like it wasn’t now replaying over and over in her head while Agatha’s hands find the edge of her shirt for the fourth time.</p><p>“Are we gonna pack or—”</p><p>“We are packing.”</p><p>“You’re straddling me on your bag.”</p><p>“I’m multitasking.”</p><p>Agatha kisses her again. Hard. Fast. One hand in her hair. One hand pushing her back. She doesn’t stop or pull away—until her phone starts to chime from across the room.</p><p>Rio groans. “Don’t answer it.”</p><p>Agatha sighs against her mouth. “I have to. It’s Jen.”</p><p>She doesn’t want her to go. Which is absurd. But the second she peels off of Rio and walks toward her phone, Rio’s already missing her weight.</p><p>“They’re downstairs,” Agatha says after reading the screen. “Alice and Jen. We’re getting Billy. I have to go.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha smiles—crooked. Soft. And then, with that same mouth that just told Alice at lunch that they were sleeping together, she leans down, grabs Rio’s jaw, and kisses her. Dirty. Sharp. Teeth and tongue. Like she’s leaving a mark on purpose. </p><p>And maybe she is.</p><p>Rio doesn’t follow her down.</p><p>She waits it out. Gives it five, then ten minutes. The three of them are leaving to get Billy anyway. Rio’s meeting them at the restaurant.</p><p>As she walks towards the lobby, she keys herself spiral. Just a little bit. She hasn’t indulged in spiraling in at least 20 hours. </p><p>Because Rio still can’t wrap her head around any of this.</p><p>She’s the florist. She showed up to do flowers. That’s it. Not this—this being invited to every damn event on the itinerary like she’s a bridesmaid. Like she’s family. Like she didn’t spend the last few years pretending she didn’t care that she got cut out of all of it in the first place.</p><p>She watches them all head toward Jen’s SUV - Alice yelling, actually yelling from across the parking lot that they’ll meet her there.</p><p>It’s ridiculous. Loud. Obnoxious. </p><p>Jen’s shaking her head, laughing like Alice is some sitcom character she tolerates out of loyalty. Agatha just turns back and gives her a small wave. A shy smile. Like they didn’t just spend an hour making out instead of packing.</p><p>Rio doesn’t wave back. She just stares a little too long, then nods once like she’s cool. Chill. Unaffected. (She is very affected.)</p><p>Valet pulls up her van, helps with her bag and she gets in, buckles up, grabs the wheel like she’s anchoring herself. And then her phone starts going off in her pocket. One buzz. Then two. Then six, back to back like something’s wrong.</p><p>She pulls it out.</p><p>It’s a new group chat.</p><p>No name. Two unknown numbers. </p><p>The title is just: wedding 💥💣🤭</p><p>Her face twists as she opens it.</p><p><strong>unknown</strong>: </p><p>hey i stole ur number from jen this is Alice btw</p><p><strong>unknown</strong>: </p><p>hi Rio :)</p><p><strong>unknown</strong>: </p><p>don’t make me throw up agatha</p><p>Jesus Christ. They’re fast.</p><p>Rio stares at the screen, thumbs hovering. She’s not used to this kind of chaos. She’s not used to being included like this. She wants to roll her eyes. She wants to smile. She kind of does both.</p><p>Another message pops in before she can answer.</p><p><strong>unknown</strong>: </p><p>don’t ignore us. we know u read this.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>Rio starts saving the numbers, just to clean it up. Alice gets saved first—she types Alice aka Gladys Kravitz. </p><p>Perfect. Stupid. Fitting.</p><p>Because Alice has been nothing but nosey since the beginning of the spa trip. </p><p>Agatha, though—she stares at the unsaved number longer. Types “Agatha.” Deletes it. Tries “Agatha 🥰” then backspaces that too. Normally she gives everyone dumb names in her contacts - But Agatha?</p><p>She just types “Agatha.”</p><p>Leaves it at that.</p><p>Doesn’t feel like a big deal, but it is. She knows it is. She just won’t admit it out loud.</p><p>Her screen lights up again. New message. Separate thread.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: </p><p>hey</p><p>That’s it. Lowercase. No period. Just simple.</p><p>Rio stares at it. Her thumb hesitates. What the hell is the right move here? An emoji? Just “hey” back? She hates that she’s actually overthinking this.</p><p>Eventually, she types:</p><p align="right"><strong>Rio</strong>: </p><p align="right">hey</p><p>Sends it. Doesn’t look at it again.</p><p>Then her screen lights up with another from the group chat.</p><p><strong>Alice aka Gladys Kravitz</strong>:</p><p>agatha i can see your screen from where i’m sitting stop sexting each other and let’s start our plan</p><p>Rio drags a hand down her face.</p><p>Rio texts back into the group chat before sliding her phone in the cup holder. </p><p align="right"><strong>Rio</strong>: </p><p align="right">start your plan now I’ll read it when I’m done driving</p><p>She turns the key in the ignition.</p><p>She still has to swing by the hotel before dinner. Not because she has to. Just because she wants to. Probably to shower. Again. Definitely not because Agatha had her pressed up against every surface in that room earlier like a teenage fever dream.</p><p>Nope. Totally unrelated.</p><p>Also not related? The fact that she’s about to have dinner with Agatha, Jen, Alice… and Billy. Agatha’s kid. That kind of thing would normally send Rio running. Screaming. Off a metaphorical (or literal) cliff. But she’s surprisingly calm. Because Billy already likes her—from the wedding makeup. Called her cool. Thought it was hilarious that Evanora hated it. Rio’s not worried.</p><p>She’s really not overthinking it.</p><p>Except she kind of is.</p><p>Are they seeing each other? Her and Agatha? Rio hasn’t thought past the wedding. She didn’t plan to. She’s not sure she even can think that far ahead. Rio did ask to do whatever it is they’re doing again - and Agatha agreed. But they haven’t talked about it since. Made out like teenagers? Yes. Talked? No. But she is sure she wants to keep this going for now. At least through the wedding. <br/>She wants Agatha. Specifically.</p><p>Rio parks outside her hotel room and grabs her phone.</p><p>Twenty-two unread messages.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>All from Alice and Agatha. Of course.</p><p>She doesn’t even bother with the group chat. Just clicks straight into her thread with Agatha. Only one message.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>:</p><p>so does continuing this mean your hotel after dinner? because billy is going back to wanda’s after this</p><p>Rio stares at it. Thumb hovers over the keyboard. She feels something weird behind her ribs. She feels herself swallow.</p><p align="right"><strong>Rio</strong>: </p><p align="right">that can be arranged</p><p>She sends it before she can overthink the phrasing. </p><p>Then she scrolls through the chaos that is the group chat. Immediately regretting it.</p><p><strong>Alice aka Gladys Kravitz</strong>:</p><p>ok i found some sparklers at the hardware store</p><p>what if we do fireworks?</p><p>real ones. not just sparklers.</p><p>i know a guy.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>:</p><p>no. under any circumstances. we are not using fireworks.</p><p>i’m serious alice.</p><p>why don’t we just try to talk to jen again.</p><p><strong>Alice aka Gladys Kravitz</strong>:</p><p>are you CRAZY?</p><p>did Rio fuck something loose?</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>:</p><p>🙄</p><p>shut the fuck up alice</p><p>give a real idea then</p><p>Rio stops there. She has to get going.</p><p>She sets the phone down and hops in the shower. Maybe lingers longer than she meant to. Definitely not because of earlier. Not because Agatha had her breathless against the bathroom counter with her hands everywhere. Not because her hotel has a detachable shower head. </p><p>She wraps herself in a towel, hair wet, trying to pull herself back together.</p><p>There’s a knock on the door.</p><p>She hasn’t even checked her phone. Doesn’t know what time it is. But whatever. Only two people know where she’s staying - Jen and Agatha. Maybe they’re picking her up for dinner instead. </p><p>She opens the door.</p><p>And freezes.</p><p>Because it’s not Jen. It’s not Agatha.</p><p>The only thing her brain manages to formulate:</p><p>What the fuck.</p><p>But her mouth?</p><p>“…Wanda.”</p><p>She wants to slam the door. Step back in time. Be anywhere else. Maybe check the <em>actual</em> fucking peephole of the door before swinging it open. But she’s too stunned to move. </p><p>Because what the actual fuck is happening right now?</p><p>Wanda smiles. Soft. Too soft.</p><p>“Hi, Rio.”</p><p>Wanda. In jeans and a fitted blazer like she’s just walked out of some Stark-level corporate hell meeting. Makeup perfect. Hair curled just enough to look casual.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>Soaking wet. Barely covered. With wide eyes and water dripping down her collarbone.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>Rio blinks. Her mouth opens, then closes. She’s shocked. Fully sick to her stomach. Her head is screaming what the fuck is happening—but Wanda just stands there. Calm. Perfect. With that same unreadable look she always wore when they were younger, like she already knew how this would play out.</p><p>Then Wanda smiles. Small. Curious.</p><p>“Just let me in, please.”</p><p>And Rio—against all better judgment, against every single screaming nerve in her body—steps aside.</p><p>She doesn’t say yes. Doesn’t say anything. Just moves.</p><p>Wanda walks in like she owns the place. Like she’s entitled to walk into hotel rooms where her ex-girlfriends are wrapped in towels and confusion. She doesn’t even pause—just glides over to the little armchair in the corner and sits. Crosses her legs. Looks around the room like she’s assessing it. Like she’s studying Rio’s life from a distance.</p><p>Rio shuts the door.</p><p>What the fuck.</p><p>She’s still dripping. Still basically naked. She turns, catches her reflection in the mirror above the desk, and remembers what she looks like right now.</p><p>“Let me—uh—get dressed real quick.”</p><p>Wanda doesn’t respond. Just nods. Settles in.</p><p>Rio grabs her clothes off the bed and disappears into the bathroom. Shuts the door harder than she meant to. Not a slam. But almost.</p><p>She leans back against it. Clutching her outfit to her chest.</p><p>Takes the biggest breath of her life.</p><p>What. The. Fuck.</p><p>Wanda Maximoff is in her hotel room. Looking calm. Too calm. And it’s terrifying. And Rio’s still got water running down her back. She doesn’t even want to look.</p><p>This is a nightmare. Some alternate reality. Something.</p><p>Because this? This makes no sense.</p><p>She collects herself. Barely. Just enough to shakily pull on her clothes—jeans, a t-shirt, something plain. Neutral. Her fingers tremble as she drags them through her hair, working out the knots with more aggression than she means to.</p><p>Then she looks up at the mirror.</p><p>Not bad. Not great. But good enough. As good as Wanda’s gonna get.</p><p>As good as Wanda deserves.</p><p>She takes one more breath. Deep and slow. And opens the bathroom door.</p><p>Wanda’s still there. Still seated like this is a casual run-in. Like she didn’t show up unannounced to a hotel room she should never know about. Rio walks out and stands for a beat, unsure what to do with her hands. Her body. </p><p>She settles for the edge of the bed.</p><p>“What are you doing here, Wanda?”</p><p>And that’s when Wanda’s face shifts.</p><p>Just a fraction. But Rio catches it. A slow twist of her mouth. Her jaw. Something unsettled under the surface, some look Rio’s never seen before—not that she can’t still remember every other look Wanda’s ever given her. (They still show up in dreams. Or nightmares.)</p><p>Wanda waits.</p><p>Waits long enough that Rio fidgets.</p><p>Waits long enough that Rio counts five full seconds of Wanda grinning at her.</p><p>“I should ask you the same question, Rio.”</p><p>“The wedding,” Rio says. Her voice is sharp. Defensive without trying to be. “I’m here for the wedding.”</p><p>Wanda lifts a brow. Like she’s entertained. Like she knows something Rio doesn’t.</p><p>“Ah yes—Jen’s wedding. I heard you’re a florist?”</p><p>And what the fuck.</p><p>What the actual fuck.</p><p>Why is she having this conversation with her right now? Why is Wanda in her room, acting like this is coffee-shop small talk and not eight years too late? Rio’s brain can’t keep up - an hour ago Agatha’s tongue was down her throat and now Wanda fucking Maximoff is sitting in her hotel room talking about flower arrangements like they’re acquaintances.</p><p>Agatha’s ex wife. Rio’s ex-girlfriend. <br/><br/>Jesus Christ she’s living a lesbian cliche.</p><p>“Yeah. Evanora asked,” Rio mutters, barely hearing herself. The words taste wrong in her mouth. </p><p>Wanda hums like that’s quaint. Like that’s the thread she wants to tug on. She tries for more small talk, another smile that doesn’t fit her face anymore. </p><p>Rio’s going to be sick. Or she’s going to snap. It’s one or the other.</p><p>“What do you want, Wanda?” Rio interrupts Wanda. </p><p>“Nothing! Honestly,” she says, too quickly. Wanda gets up and starts pacing back and forth in front of Rio. “Billy couldn’t stop talking about you since you gave him the makeup the other day. Kept mentioning a Rio. And at first, when he said your name, I didn’t think it was you. Just a coincidence. But when he said it pissed off Evanora, well - ” She shrugs. “I needed to see you for myself.”</p><p>“Why, Wanda?” Her voice is sharper now, and she doesn’t hide it. “It’s been like eight years.”</p><p>Wanda’s grin stretches. Twists. It’s nearly scary.</p><p>Rio’s chest tightens.</p><p>“Why?” Wanda repeats, tilting her head. “You know the day you left me at the bleachers?”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Of course she does.</p><p>Very pivotal moment for baby gay Rio.</p><p>The day before graduation. </p><p>“I went home and told my parents no. I wouldn’t be with Vision. I wasn’t going to follow their whole plan for me. I wanted you.”</p><p>And there it is.</p><p>The slap to the chest she wasn’t ready for.</p><p>“But you—” Wanda’s voice breaks, but her smile doesn’t. “You disappeared, Rio. On me. I tried everything. Everything. Including asking Evanora where you went.”</p><p>The air in the room feels warped now. Too still. Too heavy.</p><p>Rio opens her mouth—but nothing comes out.</p><p>What the actual fuck is Wanda saying?</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenches so hard her molars ache.</p><p>But Wanda’s not done. She’s letting it all out now, like she’s been saving this monologue in the back of her throat for years.</p><p>“I tried everything, Rio. You blocked me and ran and never once reached out. You ran from me at the bleachers and you’ve been running ever since.”</p><p>And what the actual fuck is Wanda on?</p><p>Anger starts in her stomach. Hot. Acidic. It rises fast, crawling into her chest and up her throat. Because—no. No. No.</p><p>She chased Wanda. Everywhere. Hid behind dumpsters and ducked behind library shelves just to steal a few kisses after school. Spent senior year tangled in lies just to get scraps of affection. They had a plan. They had a fucking plan.</p><p>And then—right before graduation—Wanda dropped the bomb. Her and Vision had to be together. She was going to follow her parents’ bullshit blueprint. No warning. No chance to even fight for her.</p><p>Rio had said okay. Okay, fine. If that’s what you want.</p><p>And then she left.</p><p>Heart shattered but shoulders back. Took the damn plan and ran with it. Opened her shop. Built her life. Alone, yeah but free. In New York. Making art. Meeting women. On her own terms.</p><p>She was fine.</p><p>She is fine.</p><p>And then—fuck. </p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Her brain slams into the name like a wall.</p><p>Not just Agatha. Dinner.</p><p>“Shit,” Rio mutters aloud. She shoots to her feet, looking around frantically for her phone. “What time is it?”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Rio snatches her phone off the desk, heart pounding against her ribs like it’s trying to escape her chest. The lock screen’s lit up—missed calls, unread messages.</p><p>Because of course she’s late. Of course.</p><p>She’s about thirty minutes late.</p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Agatha.</p><p>She doesn’t even read them. She can’t. Not while Wanda’s still sitting ten feet away, spinning her own version of the past like it was some kind of tragic love story instead of the worst goddamn heartbreak of Rio’s life.</p><p>So she just types.</p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio:</strong>
</p><p align="right">something came up. I’ll be there tomorrow for whatever is on the itinerary. sorry.</p><p>Not a good message. Not even close. But it’s fast. Clean. Enough to stop them from waiting on her, enough to buy her time to fucking breathe. She’ll send a better message later. Fix it. Make it up to Agatha somehow. </p><p>Right now?</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>Wanda with her hands clasped in her lap like she’s the one who got hurt. Wanda, watching her with that same unreadable, wide-eyed look that always made Rio feel like she was being studied. Picked apart.</p><p>“Really?” Wanda scoffs. “I just tell you all of that and you’re on your phone?”</p><p>Rio turns to her sharply, eyes flashing. “Hold on a fucking second. I had dinner plans.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Wanda huffs. Like it’s nothing.</p><p>Rio feels her jaw tighten again. “What do you want me to say, Wanda?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Something. Anything!”</p><p>Rio can’t help it, she laughs. It’s bitter. Ugly. “I don’t see why it’s such a big deal anymore now, Wanda. You told me you weren’t going through with our plans the day before we were going to leave. Are you really mad that my eighteen-year-old self blocked you?”</p><p>Her phone buzzes in her palm again.</p><p>She ignores it. Her voice gets louder.</p><p>“Wanda, you broke my heart that day. It was supposed to be us against the world. I lost myself trying to love you. Chasing you down like some secret. Whatever you wanted, I’d kill myself trying to get it for you.”</p><p>Wanda flinches. Rio doesn’t stop.</p><p>“And the day before graduation, you tell me never mind, you’re going to start dating some dude? Vision? You think that didn’t gut me?”</p><p>“But I didn’t!” Wanda blurts, voice pitching high. “You’re not listening, Rio, I tried. I tried to tell you—”</p><p>“But you were going to go through with it at first,” Rio snaps, eyes hot now, throat tight. “Even if you changed your mind. I wasn’t the first choice then.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression breaks, just for a second. And Rio - </p><p>She can’t stand it.</p><p>Because she used to dream about that face. </p><p>And all she wants is to go back thirty minutes and get to dinner on time. To Agatha.</p><p>Instead, she’s here. Stuck with a ghost from her own past. </p><p>“That’s not fair, Rio. I was also just a kid. Going against my parents’ wishes? I did it. And you still left.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t even blink. Doesn’t flinch. She’s so far past done with this conversation, she might as well be in another fucking dimension. “Wanda, this is all in the past. Why does it matter anymore?”</p><p>It comes out sharper than she planned, but good. Maybe it’ll cut through whatever version of reality Wanda’s clinging to.</p><p>“Honestly?” Wanda says, soft, almost like she’s trying to sound wounded. “I told you earlier. I wanted to see you for myself. I never thought I’d see you in Westview again.”</p><p>Yeah, well. She never thought she’d be here either. If it wasn’t for this wedding, she’d still be in New York, blissfully Wanda-free.</p><p>“Well,” Rio says, arms crossed tight over her chest, “you saw me.”</p><p>And Wanda—fucking giggles. </p><p>What the fuck. </p><p>Like this is a reunion. Like this is funny. Like any of this is okay.</p><p>It makes Rio want to scream.</p><p>Instead, she starts moving toward the door. No words. No warning. She just wants her out. Now. She grabs the handle and gestures—not kindly.</p><p>Wanda doesn’t budge.</p><p>“Wait. Wait, Rio. Wait.”</p><p>So Rio does. Not because she wants to. Because something in her spine tells her to hold still. And they’re too close now. Wanda’s standing in her space like she’s still welcome in it. Like nothing ever happened. Like she still knows her.</p><p>She doesn’t.</p><p>Rio just wants her gone. She can’t breathe right, the air in the room too thick, too tight.</p><p>Then—she feels it. A hand on her arm.</p><p>And that’s when Rio shuts down.</p><p>Rio shuts her eyes.</p><p>Wanda’s hand is still on her arm, fingers curled in a way that sends ice crawling down her spine. It doesn’t feel warm. Doesn’t feel familiar. It feels wrong.</p><p>She wants it off. Now.</p><p>She goes to push it away, gentle at first—just enough pressure to say don’t—but Wanda’s grip tightens. Stronger than expected. Possessive. </p><p>“These are new,” Wanda says, voice low. Fingertips brushing over the ink on Rio’s forearm. </p><p>And—fuck. Is she really asking about her tattoos right now?</p><p>Rio yanks her arm back. “Wanda, I think you should go.”</p><p>It’s not a question. It’s barely polite.</p><p>Wanda nods. Like she agrees. </p><p>But she doesn’t fucking move.</p><p>Rio turns away. One step toward the door. Her heart is hammering in her throat. Every inch of her skin feels like it’s vibrating with pressure. She can’t breathe. Can’t think—</p><p>And then—</p><p>Another knock.</p><p>Another <em>knock</em>.</p><p>Rio is one second away from throwing her phone, her chair, maybe herself out the damn window.</p><p>Who the fuck else needs something from her tonight?</p><p>She moves fast. Doesn’t think. Just yanks the door open because maybe - maybe, whoever it is can help her get Wanda the hell out of her room. </p><p>And of course. </p><p>Of fucking course.</p><p>Everything gets so much worse.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s Jen.</p><p>She doesn’t look past the threshold. Doesn’t glance into the room. Doesn’t check for a reaction, or if she’s interrupting something, or even if Rio is alone.</p><p>She just talks. Like she memorized every word. Like she’s rehearsed it over and over in her head on the way down the hall and now she’s scared to deviate. Scared of whatever the answer might be.</p><p>“Hey, uh—Agatha said something came up for dinner,” Jen says, fast. Stiff. “And I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t something I did. Or that any of us did. Because, Rio, I know we weren’t ever close growing up but—Wanda?”</p><p>And fuck.</p><p>It’s worse.</p><p>Somehow. Instantly. Unquestionably.</p><p>Worse.</p><p>Rio doesn’t even know why yet. Can’t name it. Can’t pin it down. But the second Jen says that name, it’s like something in her chest lurches sideways.</p><p>Wanda is behind her. Still.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>Not helping.</p><p>Probably smirking.</p><p>Rio doesn’t have to turn around to know it. Can feel the smugness radiating off her like heat.</p><p>Jen doesn’t know about them. Never did. Neither did Evanora. No one. Not a soul. That was the point. That was the rule. It had been theirs—just theirs. A secret folded tight between lockers and gym bleachers and the backs of movie theaters. The kind of secret sealed in whispered promises and shaky hands under a blanket of stars.</p><p>Well—Pietro knew.</p><p>Once.</p><p>Senior year. He walked in on them kissing in Wanda’s bedroom. Blinked like he didn’t quite register it, then yelled, “Use protection!” in the voice of a sitcom dad and shut the door behind him like it never happened.</p><p>Rio hadn’t thought about that night in years. Another memory she boxed up and shoved to the back of her brain. Padlocked it. Buried it. Along with every Wanda-shaped feeling she swore she was done with.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Until this week.</p><p>Now everything’s pressing in. Tight and sharp and too loud. Her chest feels like it’s wrapped in wire. Her hands are cold. Her brain won’t stay still.</p><p>She should’ve said no to Evanora.</p><p>Should’ve said no to this wedding. To Westview. To this whole damn week.</p><p>Her life is supposed to be calm now. She built it that way. Carefully. Intentionally. Piece by piece. Flower by flower. Client by client. No drama. No mess. No history.</p><p>Nothing like this.</p><p>Jen is still there. Still blinking at her. Still waiting.</p><p>Still expecting her to say something that makes sense.</p><p>“Hey Jen. Long time no see, like at least 20 minutes” Wanda says, casual as hell.</p><p>Rio doesn’t turn around. Doesn’t need to.</p><p>She hears the shift in Jen’s voice immediately. A full stop. Sharpened.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Jen asks.</p><p>And Wanda? Doesn’t miss a beat. “Why are you here?”</p><p>Her tone matches. Just as biting. Just as loaded.</p><p>And Rio—</p><p>Rio hasn’t said anything real yet. Not a single word that matters. Her throat is too thick, too locked up, and her brain won’t stop spiraling. Everything feels like it’s moving too fast and too slow all at once.</p><p>She’s going to lose it. Right here. In front of both of them.</p><p>Freak out. Snap. Scream.</p><p>Or maybe all three.</p><p>“I was just checking on Rio,” Jen says again. Rewinds. Replays. Her voice softens slightly, like it’s an afterthought. “Am I interrupting something?”</p><p>“No!” Rio blurts. Too loud. Too fast. “No, you’re not.”</p><p>It sounds like a lie.</p><p>Because it is. Rio’s brain just hasn’t caught up to what exactly Jen’s interrupting. </p><p>And the interruption is very much welcomed. </p><p>Wanda scoffs. Crosses the room without hesitation. Like she owns the place. Like she’s not the one who lit this whole thing on fire in the first place.</p><p>She pulls a sleek little business card from her jacket pocket. Holds it out like it’s a peace offering. </p><p>“Just… text me before you go back to New York, okay?” she says. “We can get coffee or something.”</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>She doesn’t mean to. Doesn’t even think about it. It’s reflex. An escape hatch.</p><p>She just needs her gone.</p><p>Jen watches the whole exchange with her head tilted slightly. Eyes narrowed. Quiet.</p><p>She doesn’t say a word until the door shuts behind Wanda.</p><p>Then she shakes her head. Slow. Like she just watched something derail in real time.</p><p>“What was that?” she asks, low. Not angry. Not yet. Just confused. Baffled. Like she’s trying to do math in her head and nothing’s adding up.</p><p>Rio feels the panic rising again. Crawling up her spine. Throat tight. Every muscle braced. </p><p>She clears her throat. </p><p>“I guess Billy told her about the makeup I gave him at brunch the other day,” Rio muttered, barely keeping her voice steady. “She figured out I was in town and showed up. Said she wanted to talk.”</p><p>Jen leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. Not angry. Not even skeptical. Just… watching.</p><p>Observing in that quiet, unnerving way she always had. The way that made Rio feel like she was being held under a microscope, whether she wanted to be or not. Evanora does the same thing. Rio tries not to think about that either. </p><p>Rio rubbed a hand down her face. “You honestly just saved me. I’ve been trying to get her to leave for—God. Forever.”</p><p>But Jen doesn’t move. Doesn’t speak. Still just staring like she’s waiting for something more. Like she already knows the outline and is giving Rio a chance to fill in the details herself. No pressure. Just enough silence to dig into her skin.</p><p>And then Jen lets out a quiet laugh. There’s a beat, and then,  “I didn’t know who gave Billy the makeup. Agatha swore it wasn’t her. Honestly, Alice told me it wasn’t her, but I didn’t believe her.” She shakes her head slightly. “Can’t believe I didn’t put it together that it was yours.”</p><p>That makes Rio glance up. Just for a second.</p><p>Jen’s expression is somewhere between amused and stunned. </p><p>Jen tilts her head. “What did Wanda want to talk about?”</p><p>And there it is.</p><p>Rio had been hoping—naively—that Jen might let that part go. Might not ask. Might pretend she didn’t walk in on what she walked in on.</p><p>But of course not.</p><p>That’s not how Jen works. And that’s not how this week is going. Every moment seems designed to drag up something Rio thought she buried years ago.</p><p>She sighs. Long and low. Her voice barely above a whisper. “Honestly? I don’t know. We… we were together for like six months senior year. But we broke it off just before graduation.”</p><p>The words feel heavier than she expected. She doesn’t look at Jen while she says them. Just stares at her shoes like they might help hold her together. Like the admission might hurt less if she doesn’t meet anyone’s eyes while she says it.</p><p>Jen doesn’t respond.</p><p>Not right away.</p><p>And that somehow feels worse than any reaction Rio had braced herself for. Worse than judgment. Worse than confusion.</p><p>So she keeps talking. Too fast. Filling the silence before it can turn on her.</p><p>“It was high school. It wasn’t—serious or anything. She probably just… I don’t know. Wanted closure. Or to check in. Or something.”</p><p>She’s rambling now. Can hear it in her own voice. The pitch. The pace.</p><p>Because the truth is—she doesn’t know what Wanda wanted.</p><p>She hasn’t even let herself figure out how she feels about any of it. Not yet. Not when it all hit so fast. Not when it’s been sealed in the back of her mind for so long it barely felt real until today.</p><p>Jen’s eyes narrow. Her arms stay crossed. And she stares at Rio like she’s scanning for fine print. Like she’s trying to find the one sentence that doesn’t match the rest of the story.</p><p>“Nothing happened?”</p><p>The question lands soft.</p><p>Too soft.</p><p>And it makes Rio flinch a little, because it sounds harmless, but it isn’t. Not really. </p><p>But Rio doesn’t lie.</p><p>Not about this.</p><p>“No—God, no. It’s over. Been over.” Her voice comes out sharper now. More certain. Like she’s trying to ground herself with the truth. Like saying it more forcefully might make it feel more final. “I honestly was hoping I’d luck out and not see her this entire trip.”</p><p>And she means that.</p><p>She means it so much she can feel the panic still humming under her skin. Still trying to claw its way out. She doesn’t want to give Wanda another second in her brain.</p><p>So before Jen can say another word—before she can even look at her with that careful, reading-too-much-into-it expression—Rio grabs the business card still clutched in her hand, tears it clean down the middle, and throws it straight into the trash.</p><p>Not for show.</p><p>Well—maybe a little for show.</p><p>But mostly for herself.</p><p>She’s not calling Wanda. She’s not texting her. She’s not grabbing coffee. She’s not reopening that box.</p><p>She’s not.</p><p>Jen watches her for another beat, eyes steady. Still measuring. Still calculating something behind that quiet gaze.</p><p>Then, finally, she shrugs. “Fine. But since I just saved you—you’re welcome, by the way—you can make it up to me by coming to dinner.” Her smile softens. “We waited for you.”</p><p>And Jesus. Fuck. </p><p>Rio feels it like a punch.</p><p>Not from Jen’s words—but from what’s underneath them.</p><p>They waited for her.</p><p>That shouldn’t hit her as hard as it does. Shouldn’t knock the wind out of her like it matters. But something inside her—something tight and protective and half-frozen since she got to Westview—sits up a little straighter at the sound of it.</p><p>She swallows around the lump building in her throat.</p><p>Grabs her phone.</p><p>Falls into step behind Jen without a word, sliding into the car like her body knows what to do even if her brain’s still catching up.</p><p>The silence in the car is merciful. Calm. Jen doesn’t push, doesn’t prod. Just drives, one hand on the wheel, the other drumming lightly on her thigh. It’s easy. Comfortable. Like none of the last ten minutes between the two of them happened. Like Rio isn’t still trying to claw her way out of whatever the hell that moment with Wanda was.</p><p>Eventually, Rio unlocks her phone.</p><p>Notifications flare to life—missed calls, a few texts.</p><p>Alice. Jen. But it’s Agatha’s name that catches her thumb. That makes her breath catch in her chest.</p><p>She opens their thread.</p><p>
<strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p>hey we made it to the restaurant we’re headed in :)</p><p>we got a corner booth :)</p><p>jen ordered you a drink - it’s a joke (i think)</p><p>[a photo of a drink with - Rio has to squint at the picture - a gummy penis hanging off the rim]</p><p>okay I’m now drinking ur penis drink</p><p> </p><p>Rio stares at the messages, her screen glowing in the dim car. Her heart stutters once, then settles into a low, uneasy thrum. She scrolls down.</p><p> </p><p>Her own last text:</p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p align="right">something came up. I’ll be there tomorrow for whatever is on the itinerary. sorry.</p><p> </p><p>And right below it:</p><p>
<strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p>okay! I hope everything’s ok - I’ll tell jen.</p><p>not to be too horny but does that mean no to your hotel room tonight (i blame your penis drink)</p><p> </p><p>Rio presses the back of the phone to her lips, lets her eyes close for just a second.</p><p>She feels herself smile. Just a little bit. Not sure how a gummy penis drink is making her smile. </p><p>Rio knows it’s not the drink. </p><p>When they pull up outside the restaurant, Rio hesitates just outside the door.</p><p>Through the window, she can already see the table. Billy’s mid-story, eyes wide, hands flying. Alice is leaned in close beside him, clearly egging him on, grinning. </p><p>Across from them, Agatha. Elbow on the table, chin resting in her palm, smiling at whatever Billy’s saying. She laughs, then—real and open and unbothered—and it hits Rio square in the chest.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>She doesn’t know why she feels like this. Not exactly.</p><p>Maybe it’s Wanda. Maybe it’s Agatha. Maybe it’s both of them crashing together in her brain.</p><p>Or maybe it’s the fact that Billy’s sitting right there. </p><p>It’s Jen’s turn to surprise Rio.</p><p>Just as they walk up to the table, Jen claps a hand on Rio’s back—firm, grounding, almost proud.</p><p>“I come bearing Rio,” she announces, all charm and no edge. “You’re welcome, by the way. We couldn’t get her van to start.”</p><p>Her van?</p><p>Rio nearly stares at her. That’s the story? She almost wants to laugh, but the way Jen says it—so smooth, so offhanded—makes it impossible to argue. Like there’s nothing suspicious about any of it.</p><p>Alice, thank God, doesn’t question it. Just groans. “Thank God it broke down here and not in Eastview. You’d have had to wait six hours for a tow.”</p><p>And Agatha—Agatha finally looks up. “Mmhm.”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches hard in her throat.</p><p>Because Agatha looks at her. Really looks. Not just a glance or a polite acknowledgment—but a slow, deliberate sweep of her eyes that lingers just a second too long.</p><p>She’s in a simple button-up and slacks, nothing flashy, nothing meant to draw attention. But the glasses—Jesus—the glasses are different from earlier.</p><p>Rounder frames. Dark tortoiseshell. A little crooked on her face like she’s been pushing them up and down without thinking, the bridge smudged from her thumb. It makes her look a little disheveled. </p><p>Rio wants to ruin her.</p><p>“Yes, yes, thank you, Jen, for saving me,” she says quickly, her voice pitched just a little too high, the words tripping out fast as she tries not to look like she’s staring. She tugs out the only open chair—right next to Agatha—and sits before her legs can change their mind.</p><p>Jen drops into the empty seat beside Billy, her job done, ordering a drink for Rio - commenting that she’d drive everyone home.</p><p>Rio’s still trying to get a handle on her own pulse, still focused on not combusting, when she feels it.</p><p>A finger.</p><p>Light. Deliberate. Pressing just above her knee.</p><p>The air stutters out of her lungs.</p><p>Just one touch—but it’s confident. Possessive.</p><p>Like Agatha didn’t even think twice.</p><p>And then that single finger becomes the flat weight of her palm.</p><p>No one else at the table notices.</p><p>But Rio’s entire body goes still. Tense.</p><p>She turns her head just slightly—slow enough not to draw attention—and meets Agatha’s gaze beside her.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say a word. Doesn’t smirk, doesn’t blink.</p><p>Just looks at her over the rim of those crooked glasses. Steady. Calm. Like she’s daring her to react.</p><p>Her hand stays right there. The entire dinner.</p><p>It never moves. Not once.</p><p>No teasing stroke. No subtle squeeze. Just her palm resting firm and warm on Rio’s thigh like it belongs there.</p><p>Agatha’s hand seems to pull her out of the spiral currently happening in her head about Wanda. It’s grounding. Solid. </p><p>And Rio’s not sure how Agatha knew she needed that. </p><p>She barely tracks the conversation around her.</p><p>Billy is still going, full volume, animated hands flailing as he tells some long-winded story about school drop-off lines and a rogue raccoon. Alice interrupts every few minutes just to call him dramatic. Jen interjects now and then to stop them from setting the table on fire.</p><p>Agatha hardly speaks. But when she laughs—quiet and low—it vibrates straight through Rio’s leg. And every time she shifts in her seat, her hand stays exactly where it is. Like it’s glued to her. Like it never occurred to her to move it.</p><p>Then Jen signs the check and she stands, suddenly all motion and efficiency. “Alright, circus freaks. Let’s go. You’re welcome for dinner.”</p><p>It shouldn’t hit Rio like it does.</p><p>But it does.</p><p>That dumb little line—you’re welcome for dinner, freaks—lands somewhere warm and stupid in her chest.</p><p>She doesn’t say anything. Just follows quietly.</p><p>Gets in the backseat when Jen swings the door open.</p><p>Billy calls shotgun immediately—loud and victorious—before anyone else can claim it.</p><p>Which leaves Rio and Agatha squeezed in the back with Alice. Shoulder to shoulder. Thigh to thigh.</p><p>Agatha’s had a couple drinks. Not enough to be sloppy. But enough to be loose.</p><p>Her body leans easier. Her laugh slips out softer, more freely. When she slides in beside Rio, she doesn’t hesitate—just lets herself sink in, lets their legs press together like it’s natural.</p><p>Her hand finds Rio’s knee again. Casual. Confident. Like she’s been waiting all night to get back to it. Rio’s behind Billy so he can’t see the movement. And it’s dark in the car - even Rio can’t really see her hand. And maybe the hand will stay like it did during dinner and Rio will can stop gay panicking. </p><p>Rio is wrong. </p><p>Agatha’s hand moves.</p><p>Just barely. Small circles, slow and steady. The barest motion of her thumb against Rio’s jeans.</p><p>All while keeping her face forward. Smiling at something Billy says. Tossing in a dry comment here and there. </p><p>They pull up to Agatha’s house first.</p><p>Rio has to climb out to let Agatha out. She doesn’t want to. Agatha’s hand is still on her thigh like a dare. But she moves anyway, opens the door, slides out into the night air that suddenly feels too sharp, too real—and then Agatha moves.</p><p>Follows.</p><p>Grabs the hem of Rio’s shirt to stop her. Just a gentle tug. Barely there. But Rio feels it like lightning down her spine.</p><p>Agatha leans in, voice sweet and casual and drunk as hell. “Hey—I’ll get Rio to her hotel. Just worry about Alice.”</p><p>Jesus fucking Christ.</p><p>She could not be more obvious if she tried.</p><p>Rio just stares at her. Because—what?</p><p>Agatha can’t drive. She’s tipsy at best, wasted at worst. And Rio’s “broken-down van” is fine—sitting untouched in the hotel parking lot. </p><p>Alice giggles. Actually giggles. Then slaps a hand over her mouth like she just remembered she’s supposed to be discreet. Her eyes go cartoon-wide. She still throws a thumbs-up from the backseat like a menace.</p><p>Rio might actually combust. Because Agatha and Alice are so obvious any outsider could figure out what’s happening here. </p><p>Except maybe Billy.  </p><p>Because Billy climbs out, completely unaware. Agatha’s hand drops instantly—like it was never there at all.</p><p>Rio catches that Jen’s watching.</p><p>Doesn’t say a word. Just gives Rio a long, unreadable look.</p><p>And shakes her head.</p><p>Billy, loud and cheerful, cuts right through whatever her and Jen have going on -</p><p>“Wanda said she’s turning the corner and will be here in just a second!”</p><p>Agatha jumps. Barely. </p><p>Rio’s heart slams against her ribs.</p><p>Wanda again? Twice in one night?</p><p>Her mind goes blank for a second. Then panic kicks in. Maybe it won’t be a disaster. </p><p>But Agatha’s already pulling back. Too composed. “Do you need anything before you go?” she asks Billy, like none of this is happening.</p><p>Billy grins. “Maybe just your cooking. Ooh—and soap! I’ll go grab it.”</p><p>And then he’s jogging toward the house like this is all normal. The door bangs open behind him.</p><p>Agatha turns slowly on her heel, arms folding loose over her chest. And when she looks back at Rio—her whole expression shifts.</p><p>Soft. A little smug. Pleased with herself.</p><p>“Before you say anything,” she says, already grinning, “it was Alice’s idea.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “What was?”</p><p>“She wants to talk to Jen alone about the wedding.” Agatha shrugs. Feigning innocence. “It just works out that you’re at my house right now.”</p><p>Of course.</p><p>The plan. The not-so-subtle conspiracy to derail a wedding.</p><p>But that look Jen gave her earlier—that wasn’t just about the car ride or saving her a seat. Jen knew. Not everything. But something. She’s picking up threads, pulling at them.</p><p>Rio doesn’t have time to sort it out. And honestly, right now, she doesn’t want to.</p><p>She has Agatha right in front of her. </p><p>Even if Wanda is coming. </p><p>It probably won’t be a disaster. </p><p>So she plays along, casual. Teasing. “Just at your house? Or do I get the grand tour? Maybe start with your room?”</p><p>Agatha pauses. Just a second. Then there it is—that look. Her eyes shift, darken. Her smirk sharpens like a blade.</p><p>Good. Rio can do this.</p><p>She still has things to say. About Wanda. About everything.</p><p>But then—</p><p>Headlights.</p><p>Bright and sudden, cutting across the driveway, painting everything in sharp contrast. Cold light on skin. On shadows. </p><p>Just like that, Rio’s yanked back to reality.</p><p>Out of the warmth of Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>Out of the quiet, reckless possibility of the moment.</p><p>Back to her.</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>The car door opens.</p><p>Too slow. Rio should’ve moved. Should’ve dragged Agatha inside the second Billy went for the damn soap. But she stood here instead—flirting like a fool. </p><p>Every time Agatha’s near, she forgets how to think through something - anything. All thoughts just leave her. </p><p>Agatha steps back. A full step.</p><p>Rio watches the rise and fall of her chest as she takes a slow breath. Bracing herself. For the same reason Rio’s bracing her own self.</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>Yeah. This might go bad.</p><p>Wanda steps out of the car - left still running in the street. </p><p>Agatha tries anyway. Her voice calm. “He’s just grabbing soap or something. He’ll be right here.”</p><p>But Wanda doesn’t even glance at her. Doesn’t blink.</p><p>Her eyes are locked on Rio. Cold. Sharp. Like she’s aiming.</p><p>And Rio feels it. Deep.</p><p>Agatha notices. Of course she does.</p><p>But Rio can’t look at her right now. Doesn’t want to see her face. Doesn’t want to see the reaction to what’s about to unfold.</p><p>Still, Agatha tries to introduce them, “Wanda, this is Rio—”</p><p>Wanda cuts her off. Quick. Final. “I’m very aware.”</p><p>That’s it. That’s all it takes.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snap to hers. Sharp. What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p><p>Agatha glances between them, trying to catch up. Trying to fill in the blanks between Wanda’s clipped words and Rio’s too-stiff posture.</p><p>The silence goes long and strange.</p><p>But before anyone can speak—</p><p>Billy bursts back through the door. Soap in one hand, something shoved in his mouth. He looks ridiculous. </p><p>“Found it!” he yells through a mouthful.</p><p>He wipes his hand on his jeans like that helps, then pulls Agatha into a hug. She lets him. A quick squeeze, a pat on the back.</p><p>“Tomorrow you’re free from wedding stuff,” she says, stepping away. “But I’m picking you up tomorrow night. We’ve got the rehearsal dinner the next day, so no sneaking out of town.”</p><p>Billy laughs. “Okay, no problem.”</p><p>And then—surprise—he turns to Rio. Doesn’t hesitate. Wraps her in a hug like they’re old friends.</p><p>“Cool to see you again, Rio.”</p><p>She freezes. Just a second. Then hugs him back lightly. “Yeah. You too.”</p><p>He hops down the driveway like this is the easiest night of his life. Climbs into Wanda’s car, still chewing.</p><p>Wanda lingers. Shakes her head. Then gets in the car. </p><p>Rio watches the entire scene. Wanda's hands on the wheel. Eyes forward.</p><p>She looks like she wants to say something. Her jaw moves. Her fingers tap the leather once.</p><p>Then she shakes her head.</p><p>And drives away. </p><p>Rio turns back to Agatha.</p><p>She’s still flushed from the alcohol earlier tonight—cheeks warm, lips parted, eyes soft.</p><p>Breathtaking.</p><p>Rio smiles, just a little. She can do this.</p><p>She has to.</p><p>“I need to talk to you about something.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Wanda glaring at Rio was… well.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>“I’m very aware,” she said.</p><p>Okay, then. Excuuuuse her.</p><p>Jesus Christ, her ex-wife can never make anything easy.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t even acknowledge the way Wanda pulls away. She’s already halfway checked out, playing I’m very aware on a loop in her head with increasing annoyance. Like it’s a song she didn’t ask to hear but now can’t stop humming. Great.</p><p>And then Rio turns to her. That soft smile barely showing—just a suggestion of it—and says:</p><p>“I need to talk to you about something.”</p><p>Right.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>That’s not terrifying at all.</p><p>Her buzz is still going strong—thank God for penis drinks—but the words I need to talk to you have a sobering quality - a vibe killer. She’s not about to let that happen.</p><p>Agatha gives a quick nod, like she’s completely fine, like her heart didn’t just tap the brakes. “Yeah, let’s go inside.”</p><p>It should be weird. Maybe it is. Probably.</p><p>Whatever Rio’s about to say—it’s probably going to be weird. And probably something to do with Wanda. </p><p>And maybe Agatha’s face shows it. Her wariness.</p><p>But Rio’s been… careful. With her.</p><p>So damn gentle.</p><p>So patient.</p><p>Agatha can be gentle too. </p><p>She points toward the couch. Doesn’t say anything. Just gestures like, Here. Sit. </p><p>Then she moves to grab a bottle of wine and two glasses before returning to the living room.  She’s committing to the buzz now. Doubling down. If this conversation goes off the rails, she’s going to need a drink to ride it out.</p><p>She hears Rio clear her throat. Doesn’t hear her sit. Doesn’t hear movement, actually.</p><p>Agatha glances over her shoulder. Brow raised. Already pouring. “Rio—?”</p><p>Rio’s voice is too soft. Not like her at all.</p><p>“Honestly, Agatha… if there was a time to tell you, I would have. But there wasn’t ever a good time.”</p><p>Mid-pour, Agatha pauses.</p><p>Oh, good. We’re opening with dread.</p><p>She tops off her glass like she’s going into battle. No pacing herself now. The second her ass hits the couch, she takes a solid gulp.</p><p>Still, Rio doesn’t sit. She just stands there, shifting slightly, hands flexing open and closed like she’s thinking about what to do with them but not committing. Like this moment might collapse in on itself if she moves too fast.</p><p>Agatha watches her. Tries to keep her voice even.</p><p>“Okay,” she says. </p><p>Rio hesitates. “It’s not - I didn’t lie, not exactly. I just - okay, well Jen lied but,” Agatha feels her eyebrow on her forehead. “About my van. It’s perfectly fine.” Rio shakes her head, jaw tight. “She was - I don’t know why Jen said my van broke down. I think she was maybe trying to cover for me? I haven’t figured it out yet. Not that there’s anything to cover - not really. But the reason why - I should’ve said something sooner. I wanted to. A few times. But it always felt like it would make things worse.”</p><p>Agatha tips her head. “You’re really doing a lot of buildup for this.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio finally sits. Far end of the couch. Like Agatha’s going to explode or start breathing fire. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio adds, rushing now. “I didn’t want to—this whole week has been good. You’ve been… I mean, I didn’t expect to—”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha mutters. She drowns another huge mouthful of wine. “You’re killing me here.”</p><p>Rio winces. “Sorry, sorry. I’m getting there.”</p><p>Agatha leans back, glass tight in her hand. The buzz is turning. Sharpening. All that warm electricity she’d been riding earlier - gone.. Like Rio’s pulled the emergency brake on a moving car.</p><p>“Because right now,” Agatha says, tilting her head, “it sounds like you’re preparing me for a murder confession. Should I be bracing for that?”</p><p>Rio finally looks at her. Really looks. That quiet kind of eye contact that makes Agatha feel like something’s about to shift.</p><p>“No. God. It’s not—”</p><p>“Then what?” Agatha asks, softer now. But her foot taps once against the coffee table. She doesn’t like this version of Rio. All twisted up and folding inward. “Rio, please just tell me.” </p><p>Rio flinches again. Just a flicker. But then she straightens. Clears her throat.  Steels herself. Says: “I dated Wanda. In high school.”</p><p>Agatha blinks.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Huh.</p><p>Honestly, if you had asked Agatha fifty times to guess what Rio was going to say it wouldn’t have been that. </p><p>Interesting. </p><p>She sits back slightly.</p><p>Her first instinct is to laugh. She doesn’t. Mostly because she can feel how hard Rio is trying not to flinch.</p><p>“You dated Wanda.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“In high school.”</p><p>Rio nods. Grim, like she just confessed to murder instead of gay teen drama.</p><p>Agatha blinks again. Then shrugs. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio’s brows pinch. “That’s it?”</p><p>“I mean…” Agatha leans forward, balancing the wine glass on her thigh. “Was that the big reveal? That you and my ex-wife were a thing when you were, what, sixteen?”</p><p>“Eighteen,” Rio mutters. “But yeah.”</p><p>Agatha just stares at her. She’s not necessarily surprised Wanda never mentioned Rio. Agatha didn’t know any of her exes. Wanda would always change the subject. </p><p>Still. Was that it?</p><p>Then sets the glass down on the coffee table with a soft clink. “You do remember we didn’t even talk in high school, right? I was busy with Jen and Alice and failing my driver’s test and pissingboff Lilia.”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth, closes it, then actually laughs. Quiet. A little shaky.</p><p>“So it’s not a big deal?” she asks.</p><p>Agatha lifts one shoulder. “I mean—should it be?”</p><p>“No. No - it’s over. But the reason I’m telling you this is - well - when Jen came to pick me up - Wanda had -“ </p><p>Agatha tops off her glass. “Rio. I mean this with my whole heart. And in the nicest way possible. Please spit it out.” </p><p>“Okay - sorry. Sorry.” Rio sucks in a breath, “Jen walked in on Wanda and I talking. In my hotel room. And nothing - nothing - happened. But I guess Billy was talking about me to her and she put it together that I was back in town. And so she cornered me in my hotel room. I’m not even sure what she wanted. She just was making small talk. And then Jen showed up- and I didn’t want it to turn into something big if you had heard it from someone else instead of me just telling you. That Wanda was in my hotel.” </p><p>And okay. Honestly Rio has a good point. She’d probably be pissed. But more for the lying. She’ll make sure to corner Jen about it later. </p><p>But still. Rio seeing Wanda? Agatha genuinely feels very neutral about it. Maybe apologetic even - for Rio having to deal with Wanda. </p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?” </p><p>“Well, Rio I’m not sure what exactly you want me to say?”</p><p>“I don’t know, I just wanted to make sure it didn’t turn into something big,” Rio responds. </p><p>“Do you think it’s going to turn into something big?” </p><p>Rio blinks. “Well. No. But now I feel like you’re speaking in code or something.”</p><p>Agatha smirks, just a little. Rio groans.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“In case you haven’t noticed this—I don’t do emotional talk.”</p><p>Agatha hums, low and dry. “Noticed.”</p><p>“This is like. Big steps. Massive.”</p><p>She watches her. Really watches her now. Rio’s face is flushed—not from the wine, not just nerves. It’s the effort. The trying of it all. The panic underneath.</p><p>Rio frowns. “Were you speaking in code or something?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs again, slower this time. “Well… do I need to be?” She leans back. Voice soft but steady. “I don’t mean to be cliché here, Rio, but you asked me to continue this. Whatever this is.” Her brow lifts. “So what is this?”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth. Closes it.</p><p>Opens it again. Still nothing.</p><p>One more go—like a fish gasping for clarity.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t move. Doesn’t fill the silence. She just watches. Steady. Patient. Like Rio might bolt if she breathes too loudly.</p><p>Finally, Rio says, “Agatha. I don’t—I don’t know.”</p><p>Agatha tries hard not to sigh. Or roll her eyes. She knows this is hard. She knows Rio’s trying. </p><p>So she softens. Just barely. “Rio—”</p><p>But Rio holds up a hand. “Wait. It’s not me trying to deflect. That’s a real answer.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips press together. She nods. Barely.</p><p>Rio pushes on. “Just—what I mean is, I don’t do this. Like at all. I’m not one for continuing… whatever this is.” Her voice is climbing. Breathing like she just ran ten blocks. “But fuck, Agatha—you haven’t left my thoughts. Since that night at the bar. Even when it was just flirting and you didn’t know who I was.”</p><p>Agatha swallows. Hard.</p><p>Rio’s voice drops lower. Rough. Honest in a way that almost hurts.</p><p>“You’re just… addicting.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t move. Doesn’t blink. Her chest is a little too tight for either.</p><p>“So I don’t know,” Rio finishes, exasperated. “Because I don’t do this. I don’t continue it the next day. I don’t sit on couches and say feelings. But I do know I really can’t give you an answer when I’m going back to New York.”</p><p>Agatha’s face doesn’t change, but her fingers tighten around the wineglass.</p><p>Because fuck.</p><p>She’s leaving.</p><p>Right. </p><p>Agatha knew that. </p><p>And still, it doesn’t feel good to hear it out loud.</p><p>But she did know. </p><p>So she tells herself it’s fine. She can handle the next few nights. She can play it however Rio wants to play it. Pretend it’s casual. Pretend she’s not already hooked. It’s not like she can afford to get attached anyway.</p><p>Wanda just moved to Eastview. Billy’s whole life is about to be flipped inside out. And Agatha? She’s going to be right there, navigating the wreckage, coordinating custody, swallowing every petty instinct just to make co-parenting slightly less of a war zone.</p><p>Rio won’t be around for any of it. So really—this is a good thing. A clean exit. A built-in expiration date.</p><p>Agatha tells herself that again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>She takes another long sip of wine, lets it burn a little on the way down, then meets Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“I knew you were leaving when we started this,” she says. Even. Measured. Or close enough.</p><p>Her gaze doesn’t waver. “So… why don’t we just play it by ear. Do what feels right. And then when it’s over—”</p><p>A breath.</p><p>“—it’s over. No big deal.”</p><p>She adds a smile to it, but it’s flimsy.</p><p>Rio stares at her.</p><p>Her mouth opens.</p><p>Closes.</p><p>Opens again.</p><p>“…Right,” Rio says eventually, and it doesn’t sound like her at all. “Right,” she repeats, like maybe this time it’ll feel more true. “No big deal.”</p><p>She doesn’t look at her. Just drops her gaze to the floor like it might have answers. Her knee bounces once. Her jaw’s tight. Agatha notices the way her fingers curl into the hem of her shirt and hold.</p><p>A second passes.</p><p>Then another.</p><p>Rio clears her throat. “Okay. So—play it by ear. Casual. I can do that.”</p><p>But she doesn’t move.</p><p>Just stares at her untouched wine like she’s still mid-thought.</p><p>Agatha watches her. </p><p>
<em>This is fine. </em>
</p><p>“I just… the Wanda thing,” Rio says, looking up quickly. “I know you said it’s not a big deal, but I need to make sure. I wasn’t trying to hide it or anything. I just didn’t know when to bring it up, and then Jen said the thing about my van—”</p><p>Agatha almost rolls her eyes. Almost.</p><p>“Rio,” she says. Quiet this time. Soft around the edges. </p><p>And Rio freezes.</p><p>Still trying to explain something Agatha stopped caring about five minutes ago.</p><p>And honestly?</p><p>She’s over it. All of it. They had the talk Rio wanted. They played nice. But now—</p><p>Now, the wine has evened her out. The house is silent. Billy’s gone. The night is still young.</p><p>And Rio’s still here.</p><p>So Agatha reaches forward. Calm. Deliberate.</p><p>She takes the glass from Rio’s hand and sets it next to hers on the coffee table, slow enough to make sure Rio watches the whole thing. Then she slides into her lap in one smooth, practiced movement, knees bracketing her hips.</p><p>Rio freezes again—but differently this time.</p><p>Better.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha murmurs, brushing a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. Her fingers trail along her jaw, featherlight. “I heard you. I’m not upset. I don’t care that you and Wanda were a thing when you were teenagers.”</p><p>Rio swallows hard. “You’re sure?”</p><p>Agatha hums. Tilts her head. “Are you looking for an apology? Because you probably deserve one. Just for dating her. I would know.”</p><p>Rio actually laughs at that—quiet, breathless.</p><p>But then her eyes lock on Agatha’s again. Still unsure. </p><p>“You’re sure?” she repeats.</p><p>Agatha nods, then leans in until her mouth is inches from Rio’s.</p><p>“I’m sure.”</p><p>She lifts two fingers beneath her chin. Presses gently until Rio’s mouth closes.</p><p>“Now stop worrying. And let’s continue… this.”</p><p>And then she kisses her.</p><p>She feels Rio nod against her lips. </p><p>The kiss starts firm—assured. But Agatha doesn’t waste time. She deepens it fast, chasing the heat, chasing the sounds Rio makes as she melts beneath her. </p><p>Rio’s hands find her hips, gripping tight, fingers flexing like she’s trying to stay in control. She rolls her hips once, slow and purposeful, and the groan Rio lets out is everything she’s been waiting for.</p><p>That’s better.</p><p>Agatha smirks against her mouth. Then kisses her harder. Deeper. Messier. Like she’s trying to drown them both in it.</p><p>Her tongue slides past Rio’s lips, and she doesn’t hold back. She licks deep, licks like she’s starving. </p><p>And then Rio’s hands are all over her—not just holding, but tugging. At her shirt. At the buttons. Like they’ve done something personally offensive. Like she needs them gone.</p><p>Agatha hums against her mouth. Encouraging. Teasing.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio breathes, dragging her lips to Agatha’s jaw. “You look so goddamn good in your glasses.”</p><p>“Tell me more,” she murmurs, her voice a low purr against the shell of Rio’s ear. She nips at the lobe, just to feel her twitch, then pulls back just enough to try to meet her gaze.</p><p>Rio’s eyes are dark, trailing up Agatha’s body before they make eye contact. And then -</p><p>“I want to ruin you, Agatha.”</p>

<p>Agatha is jolted awake to the sound of her phone ringing. </p><p>Groaning, she goes to move and yep, she can’t move. </p><p>Rio’s got an arm under her back, one across her stomach, and one leg thrown over both of hers. She’s like a really good weighted blanket. She smells like sleep and what they did last night. Agatha’s completely trapped. </p><p>The ringing stops. </p><p>Then starts again. </p><p>Jesus Christ. </p><p>She turns her face slightly and presses her mouth to Rio’s forehead, mumbling a curse under her breath. </p><p>She starts rubbing her her over Rio’s forearm. Gentle. Repetitive. Rio makes a sound in ehr throat and buries herself deeper into Agatha’s neck like she’s meant to be there. It’s fucking cute. Painfully cute. But cute nonetheless. </p><p>Her phone’s still ringing. </p><p>Okay. </p><p>Fine. </p><p>“Rio,” she starts, gently tapping on her arm to try to pull her out of sleep. </p><p>Rio grumbles and shifts enough, just enough that Agatha can wiggle herself free to reach across the bed to the nightstand. She hears Rio grumble again as she pulls herself a little out of her grip, but she’s returning where they were with the phone in her hand. </p><p>She doesn’t even check the screen. </p><p>“What?” she answers. </p><p>“Agatha! Good morning!” Agatha’s eyes snap open. </p><p>Wanda. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Agatha closes her eyes, settling further into Rio’s side. She feels Rio’s arms return over her stomach.  “What do you need, Wanda?” </p><p>At the mention of her ex-wife’s name - well and Rio’s ex-girlfriend’s name - she feels Rio’s grip tighten a little around her, now waking to the world. </p><p>“Billy needs to grab a book from his room,” Wanda says, “We’re in the driveway.” </p><p>Agatha shoots up like she was just splashed with water. Rio half follows since she was attached to Agatha. The covers flying off of them. “Wait - Wanda. Hold on -”</p><p>Wanda’s voice is distant over the phone now, like the phone’s not pressed to her face, “Oh, good, yeah, use your key. Agatha’s awake.”</p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Her and Rio started their night in the living room. </p><p>There are clothes everywhere. Wine everywhere. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Rio slumps back in bed behind her, Agatha now out of bed and grabbing the robe hanging near her door. “Wanda hold on -” and the line is disconnected. </p><p>Agatha groans, low and mean, before turning back to look at Rio. The sheets now low on her hips, blinking up at her with sleepy - but very awake - eyes. She looks fantastic. </p><p>Agatha feels her smile before she can stop it. </p><p>“Billy’s here. I’ll be right back.” </p><p>Rio nods at her, a small smile on her face. Agatha gives her one more smile before turning out the bedroom door, closing behind her. </p><p>Her bedroom is nowhere near Billy’s but just in case - she’s not leaving the door open with Rio naked in it.</p><p>Okay. </p><p>Damage control. </p><p>Clothes - in the living room. Starting there. </p><p>She needs to catch Billy first. Redirect. </p><p>Maybe she’ll be lucky and Wanda won’t even come in. </p><p>Maybe. </p><p>She has a habit of letting herself into Agatha’s house whenever she’s here. </p><p>She barely makes it to the hallway before the front door opens. Billy’s already stepping inside, smile wide. </p><p>“Hey, Agatha.” </p><p>“Hey, honey - what did you forget?” </p><p>He’s already halfway down the hall towards his room, waving a hand, “That book Eddie’s been begging me to read. He says we’re starting today no matter what.” His voice gets quieter as he disappears into his room. </p><p>Okay good. In his room. Agatha spins towards the living room. </p><p>She lets out an exhale at the entryway. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Her bra draped over the fucking lampshade. Rio’s shirt is caught on the tv stand. Her shirt on the back of the couch. Two wine glasses sitting on the coffee table - half-full. </p><p>Her own house is going to rat her out if Wanda walks in. </p><p>She starts grabbing everything she can - throwing clothes behind the armchair in the corner. </p><p>Just as the final piece of clothing is tossed behind the chair the front door opens. Again. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Wanda’s footsteps can be heard near the front door. </p><p>Agatha crouches down, finding a sock and hurls it behind the chair too. This feels like a fucking heist. </p><p>She hasn’t even looked in the mirror, but she knows what Wanda’s about to see. Half-asleep, hair wild and in a robe. </p><p>The footsteps stop and Agatha turns around. </p><p>She’s standing in the entryway of the living room, looking too comfortable, as if this is her house still. Agatha watches her eyes scanning everything. Not subtle. Not trying to be subtle. And then Agatha watches her eyes stop in the middle of the room. </p><p>Agatha follows her gaze and - coffee table. </p><p>Two wine glasses. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>She looks back up to Wanda and she has a light smile on her face. But there’s something else. That one look - the one Wanda gives before she says something cruel. </p><p>“Hello, Agatha.” </p><p>Agatha’s not taking the bait, “Why do you insist on coming into my house?” </p><p>Wanda smiles a little brighter, but doesn’t answer the question. Just starts looking again. And then she’s looking at the glasses again. She can see Wanda trying to do the math in her head. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t move. Doesn’t show her panic. Doesn’t give Wanda anything. But her heart is pounding - she’s still a little out of breath. Still in her robe. </p><p>Wanda’s eyes drag over her slowly. Robe to hair. Back to the coffee table. Back to Agatha. </p><p>Jesus fuck. </p><p>But she knows Wanda. She’s not going to say anything yet - not with Billy in the house. She’ll wait. </p><p>Sure enough, Billy’s quick footsteps can now be heard, and as he rounds the corner, he’s holding the book he needed in his hands and a bright smile on his face.<br/>
“Okay, I’ve got it. Thanks.” </p><p>Agatha smiles at him - “You’re -”</p><p>Wanda cuts her off. “Billy, can you wait in the car for a second?” </p><p>As if Wanda was waiting for Billy to be done so she can start. </p><p>Agatha watches their son shrug, completely unaware - not even looking at the living room, just looking down at his phone again. “Yeah. Thanks, Agatha. I’ll see you tonight?” </p><p>“Yeah, honey, I’m going to come get you.” </p><p>“Okay, sounds good.” </p><p>He’s turning around and walking towards the door. </p><p>They can hear the door click shut. </p><p>Wanda doesn’t waste a second. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>Agatha expected this. She doesn’t move. Doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t react. Just rolls her shoulders back, not responding, “You’re in my house again, Wanda.” </p><p>Wanda smiles, tight and cold. “And you look like you had a very full night.” </p><p>Agatha crosses her arms, feels her eyes narrow, “What are you doing, Wanda?”</p><p>Wanda doesn’t answer. Agatha lets it be silent for just a second. </p><p>“Okay, this was a great talk, can you please get out of my house?” </p><p>Wanda crosses her arms, her gaze burning into her now. “No, I don’t think I will.”</p><p>She wants to strangle her. </p><p>“Then ask or say whatever the fuck you want to so that I can go back to bed, please.”</p><p>Wanda laughs softly, “I’m just surprised you had company, is all.” </p><p>“No, you’re not. You saw Rio here last night.” Agatha’s direct. She’s not letting Wanda play these games. </p><p>“So it was Rio?” Wanda asks. </p><p>Jesus Christ - maybe Rio was right and this was going to turn into a big deal. Well, not if Agatha can help it. </p><p>“Why does it matter, Wanda?” </p><p>Wanda tilts her head, smile - grimace? Maybe - deepens. “Is Rio still here?” </p><p>“Okay, Wanda, please get out. I don’t need to answer you on who is or isn’t in my house.” </p><p>Agatha can feel her getting under her skin now. Unfortunately for Agatha, Wanda knows every button to press, every word to crawl under her skin and get to her. How to play her. </p><p>But so does Agatha. </p><p>“Oh my God, she’s still here, isn’t she?” Wanda’s voice is a little higher pitched. </p><p>“Get out, Wanda.” </p><p>“You are absolutely ridiculous, Agatha. You know - I just moved to Eastview so that we could make this work for our family- so that Billy could have stability and you’re over here - ”</p><p>Agatha sees red. She’s done with this. Done with her ex-wife in her house. Done with her pointing fingers when she was the responsible one. </p><p>“Stability? Really? I’m going to say this one time and then you’re going to get the fuck out of my house, Wanda. You left. You did. Not me.” She’s pointing at Wanda, but she keeps going,  “I stayed here. Stayed put. For our son. Billy has stability with me. You just came back after dragging Billy and I along with every excuse why you couldn’t be there for him. An entire year of us separated before you finally moved to Eastview. Where were you all that time Wanda? Because I was here. With our son. Dinners, homework, boyfriend. All of it. Even when you told me you’d be here for all of it.” Her voice grows louder with each word. “I was the one telling you his schedule. Reminding you to call our son. Covering for you when you didn’t. I’ve been cleaning up your promises to him for a year. Now you finally feel stable enough to swoop in and play the parent because you what - moved into the next town?” Agatha steps closer, lowering her voice. She’s really done now. “You don’t get to walk into my house, throw around words like stability and family and pretend like you didn’t leave me here to handle it. All of it. Don’t accuse me of being reckless, because I’m not. And that’s not really what this is actually about. No. You don’t actually give a fuck someone could be here.” She’s shaking her head, “No. You give a fuck that it’s Rio.” </p><p>That one lands. She sees it on Wanda’s face. She watches her open her mouth - then shut. </p><p>Good. </p><p>She keeps going. </p><p>“Here’s the thing, Wanda. I’m not sure why you never told me about you and Rio. I honestly don’t give a fuck. But you also don’t get to corner her in her hotel room trying to force whatever nostalgia fantasy you have with her and then be mad at me when she’s here instead. You made all of these choices to lead you to this - and I used to have to pick up the pieces. The consequences to your own actions. Because I had to. But I don’t have to anymore. It’s none of your business if Rio is here or if it’s the Queen of fucking England.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a long breath. </p><p>She watches Wanda process, and then that fucking look. A small smirk. </p><p>She’s not sure what Wanda is planning or what’s about to come out of her mouth. But she hates that fucking look. Wanda starts to turn towards the door, but stops and turns back at her, that smirk now etched deep into her cheeks. </p><p>“She’ll leave you Agatha, just like she left me. Don’t come ask me to pick up the pieces for you when it’s over.” </p><p>And then Wanda walks out the front door. Hears the door slam shut, rattling the shelves on her wall. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>She hates her ex-wife. </p><p>She tries to calm herself down, rolling her neck and letting out a long, exhausted breath. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Okay, Wanda knows about her and Rio. Whatever her and Rio are. </p><p>Luckily for her, Jen really does not like to even fake a conversation with Wanda, so she’s probably not going to find out. </p><p>She hates lying - trying to keep up the stories. She feels a hint of anxiety creep up her throat. Uneasiness. Her breath is a little shaky now.<br/>
It’ll be okay. </p><p>Probably. </p><p>Even if Wanda tells Jen, she probably won’t believe it. Jen doesn’t trust Wanda after last year anyways. Neither does Alice. At least she has that going for her. </p><p>Rio. </p><p>Right - in her bed. Currently naked. Definitely heard all of that. Even through the bedroom door. </p><p>Damage control is probably needed. </p><p>Okay. </p><p>She heads bsck to her bedroom, opening the door with a quiet knock. She peeks her head in, Rio’s looking back at her already, sitting up in the bed - how Agatha left her. </p><p>Agatha steps through her door, sitting on the edge of the bed, turning towards Rio. “Instead of -“ </p><p>Rio cuts her off, leaning forward and grabbing her hand, “Are you okay?” </p><p>Agatha blinks at her. Feels Rio’s thumb running over the back of her knuckles. </p><p>“Heard all of that huh?” Agatha chuckles out. </p><p>Rio’s looking at her with soft eyes. No judgement. Just concern. </p><p>“Agatha, are you okay?” she asks again. Softer. Quieter but firm. </p><p>Agatha exhales through her nose. “Yeah. I just…” Her voice trails off. She stares at the spot where Rio’s hand covers hers. “Wanda knows what buttons to press. She always did.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything. Just waits. Just holds her hand.</p><p>“I mean, you know how it is,” Agatha adds, shooting her a half-hearted smirk. “I’m sure you’ve got your own horror stories.”</p><p>Rio laughs, but it’s barely a sound. “High school Wanda and adult Wanda are very different. She wasn’t - I don’t know - harsh maybe is the word -  like she is now.” Rio squeezes her hand. </p><p>Harsh is an understatement. </p><p>Cruel is better.</p><p>Agatha could use another c word to describe her ex wife. </p><p>“I’m sorry. She just gets under my skin. Pisses me off.” </p><p>Rio smiles too, but it’s soft. Not amused. Just… tender. “You didn’t seem pissed when you came back in here.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“You seemed hurt.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches. She doesn’t like that word. Doesn’t like it being true.</p><p>She glances down at their hands again. Lets herself stay there. Still. Warm.</p><p>“She’s good at that,” she admits. “The hurting part.”</p><p>Rio lifts her hand, brushes a knuckle over Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?” </p><p>Agatha snorts lightly. Shakes her head. “Well, I don’t want to bore you with the details.”</p><p>She stands, fingers tugging at the sash of her robe. It slips off her shoulders and lands in a quiet heap on the floor. </p><p>She slides back into bed, sheets cool against her legs, and reaches for Rio’s hand again. Pulls her gently, meaning to get her to lay down beside her.</p><p>But Rio doesn’t let her go.</p><p>She shifts them instead, pulling Agatha straight into her chest, into the curve of her neck.</p><p>Agatha exhales against her skin, breath catching somewhere in her throat.</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to, Agatha,” Rio murmurs, voice low, steady. One hand rubbing slow circles between her shoulder blades. “I’m just here. I just want to listen, if you want to tell me.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a deep breath. Feels her chest rise and fall with Rio’s. Nuzzles in closer, her nose brushing the base of her throat. She closes her eyes. Just breathes.</p><p>Then - </p><p>“We got Billy when Pietro died.” Her voice is flat, but not empty. Just controlled. A careful kind of steady. “Wanda’s older brother. It was a complete freak car accident, just… gone.” </p><p>She shifts a little, fingers idly tracing over Rio’s chest.</p><p>“We took Billy home from the hospital. And we didn’t even talk about it. We just did it. No big discussion. No hesitation. Just—okay. He’s ours now. The state made us do some paperwork and go to court but -“ She swallows. “I had always wanted kids. So… a teenager? That was an adjustment. But not really, you know? He was quiet. Scared. Didn’t say much. And for like a year, we were good.”</p><p>Rio’s hand is still moving over her back. Slow. Constant.</p><p>“Billy didn’t trust us at first. I don’t think he trusted anyone.”</p><p>Agatha pauses. Her fingers still.</p><p>“And then one night we were watching some terrible movie—Wanda and I. Something loud and dumb. He came to the living room, didn’t say anything, just sat between us and put his head on my shoulder.”</p><p>She breathes in.</p><p>“And it was like a switch flipped. He was in. We were good. All three of us.”</p><p>Rio stays quiet. She doesn’t move. Doesn’t rush her.</p><p>“But Wanda…” Agatha’s voice dips, thickens just slightly. “She struggled with losing Pietro. More than even Billy, I think. We tried everything. Therapy. Grief groups. Church, even.” Her mouth twists. “Nothing helped. Not really.” She presses her forehead to Rio’s collarbone, eyes still closed. “She just—I don’t know.” Agatha’s voice drops lower. “Grief consumed her.”</p><p>Her fingers tighten slightly against Rio’s side, anchoring.</p><p>“She was never the same, of course. After Pietro.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything. Just keeps holding her. Keeps breathing slow and steady.</p><p>“I didn’t even see it coming,” Agatha continues, quieter now. “Between trying to balance Billy, the bookstore, her… plus just existing.”</p><p>She lets out a hollow little laugh. No real amusement in it.</p><p>“She just said she was leaving. That she couldn’t do it anymore.”</p><p>The silence after that sits heavy. Not awkward. Just weighted.</p><p>“We weren’t even like… in love at that point. Not really. That was gone long before then.”</p><p>She nuzzles in again, like that’ll somehow make the words easier to say. “But it still—it still hurt. Her leaving.”</p><p>A pause. A breath.</p><p>“Leaving us.”</p><p>She swallows. Doesn’t move.</p><p>“I mean, yeah, I was angry and hurt that she’d leave me. Sure” Another pause. Then, quieter— “But then Billy too?”</p><p>Her voice nearly cracks on it. Doesn’t quite. Just enough to sting.</p><p>“She just walked away. Said it was too much. Like he wasn’t ours.” Rio’s hand slides up to cradle the back of her head, fingers threading into her hair. And Agatha finally lets herself fall into her. Really fall. Chest pressed tight. Legs tangled. Whole body molded to the shape of Rio’s hold.</p><p>“She barely comes around,” she mutters. “And she tries to play mom when it’s convenient. But it’s always about her. And Billy, he pretends he’s okay with it- I think to protect her feelings.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything right away. Just holds her a little tighter. Runs her fingers through Agatha’s hair with so much care it makes Agatha ache.</p><p>Then softly, just above a whisper—</p><p>“I’m really sorry she did that to you.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightens.</p><p>Rio murmurs, her mouth warm against her hair. “You didn’t deserve that. Billy didn’t either.”</p><p>Agatha blinks hard, keeping her face buried against Rio’s skin.</p><p>She doesn’t respond. Doesn’t have to.</p><p>But inside, something shifts.</p><p>Damn. Rio really does care.</p><p>Rio breathes in slow, then speaks again.</p><p>“I can’t believe Pietro’s gone,” she says quietly. “I didn’t know him well—just if I was over at Wanda’s house I’d see him. But he was always… loud. Kind. Protective of her.” Agatha hums against her throat.</p><p>“Yeah,” she says. “He was a pain in the ass. But he was her favorite person.”</p><p>“I remember,” Rio murmurs. Her hand never stops moving, still soothing over Agatha’s spine. “It’s just… sad. All of it.”</p><p>Agatha nods, but she doesn’t speak. Instead, she presses a soft kiss to Rio’s collarbone. Barely there. Then another. Higher. Slower.</p><p>Agatha shifts again, nudging her way up until their faces are level. She doesn’t say anything—just looks at her for a moment. </p><p>Then leans back down to kiss her.</p><p>Soft. Lingering. Nothing urgent yet, just her mouth moving slow against Rio’s, like she’s trying to say thank you without actually saying it.</p><p>Rio kisses her back just as slow. Just as soft. Her hand cups the side of Agatha’s face, thumb brushing over her cheekbone again like she can’t stop touching her. Agatha sighs into her mouth. Leans in more.</p><p>The kisses deepen a little. Less hesitant now. Still not rushed—just heavier. </p><p>And then -  Agatha pulls back from the kiss, just a little. Just enough to lean over Rio, hand still resting lightly on her chest.</p><p>She’s smiling now, soft and small. Rio’s looking up at her the same way. Like there’s nowhere else she’d rather be.</p><p>“So,” Agatha starts, voice a little lighter but still low, “I’ve now shared something deep and dark. Your turn.”</p><p>Rio huffs a small laugh. “Alright. What do you want to know?”</p><p>Agatha traces her fingers down Rio’s arm, pretending like she’s not being incredibly specific on purpose.</p><p>“I want to know one thing,” she says. “I asked Lilia once, but she didn’t give me a real answer.”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. Agatha pauses, just for a second. Then,</p><p>“You used to come into the shop after school.”</p><p>Rio blinks. Then nods slowly.</p><p>Agatha’s voice dips, quieter now.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Rio takes a slow breath, eyes drifting away for a moment like she has to find the words in the ceiling.</p><p>“My dad loved the store,” she says finally. “Before he met Evanora, that was our thing. We’d go there after school—he would read about anything. Everything. He didn’t have a favorite genre. He loved them all.” Agatha feels the words like a pull in her chest. </p><p>“And then,” Rio continues, “when we moved in with Evanora, we stopped going. He got busy. I was older, so I guess he thought I didn’t need it anymore.” Her voice softens. “I didn’t go by myself. Not for a long time. It felt like our spot.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t interrupt. Just listens. Just holds on.</p><p>“And then when he died…” Rio swallows. “It was the one place that still felt like him. Like us. Evanora let me keep some clothes, a few little things, but she—” A pause. Rio’s eyes close for a second. “She erased him. From the house. Like he’d never been there.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches. She remembers that - after Ramiro died, her and Alice didn’t go over for awhile but the first time they came back to Jen’s house it was like - back to where it was before Rio. </p><p>“So I went back to the shop,” Rio says. “Sat in the chair he used to read in. Did homework. Slept sometimes. Lilia left me alone—I think she knew. Or maybe she didn’t. But it was the one place that still had him in it.” Agatha doesn’t move.</p><p>Her chest aches.</p><p>Because while Rio was doing all of that—grieving, surviving, remembering—Agatha was off with Jen and Alice.</p><p>Living in the same town. Crossing paths in evanora's house. Never really seeing her.</p><p>She hadn’t known. Hadn’t asked.</p><p>They hadn’t been close, not back then. But still.</p><p>Agatha feels something heavy twist in her stomach.</p><p>Guilt. Sadness. A bitter mix of both.</p><p>She brushes her thumb over Rio’s collarbone. </p><p>“You were just a kid,” she whispers. “And you were going through all that alone.”</p><p>Rio opens her eyes again. Shrugs, but it’s small. Tired.</p><p>“Wasn’t much of a talker back then.”</p><p>Agatha leans down, presses a kiss to her shoulder. Another to the space just below her jaw.</p><p>She doesn’t even realize how long she’s been quiet until Rio shifts under her.</p><p>Rio’s arms tighten just a little, not pulling, just grounding. She tilts her head until her voice brushes the top of Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Hey,” she says, soft. “Don’t do that.”</p><p>Agatha blinks against her collarbone. “Do what?”</p><p>“Feel guilty for not knowing,” Rio murmurs. “You didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t want anyone to know.”</p><p>“But—” Agatha starts, still not quite breathing right.</p><p>Rio cuts her off gently. “I didn’t even tell Jen.”</p><p>That surprises her. She leans back a little, just enough to glance up. “You didn’t?”</p><p>Rio gives the faintest shake of her head. “Didn’t feel like there was a point. Evanora told me once I was just something she got stuck with after he died. And she made sure I never forgot it. So I just… figured I didn’t really have a family. Not really.”</p><p>The words hit her harder than she expects. Maybe it’s the way Rio says it, like it’s not meant to sound sad—but it is. And it makes her want to wrap herself around her and never let go. </p><p>Agatha exhales. “I don’t want to speak for Jen, but… she was the one who invited you.”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“She was stressed you wouldn’t come. Alice and I actually thought it was weird—totally unlike her during wedding planning. But she was insistent. Said she had to have her sister there.”</p><p>She feels it before she sees it—a warm tear slipping from the corner of Rio’s eye, catching against her own skin.</p><p>Agatha leans up, shifts just enough to really look at her.</p><p>Rio’s not crying, not really. Just looks a little distant. Sad in a quiet, buried kind of way.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio says eventually. “She’s been surprising me this whole trip.”</p><p>She blinks slowly, meets Agatha’s eyes with something honest and soft. “She’s making it feel like… like she actually wants a sister.”</p><p>Agatha brushes her hand gently over the side of her face. “Do you?”</p><p>Rio shrugs a little, but it’s not dismissive. Thoughtful. “I haven’t had too much time to think about it,” she admits. “But it feels nice. New. Like I could actually belong somewhere.”</p><p>That ache in Agatha’s chest just expands. Because she knows what that feeling is like. Wanting something to feel like home, and being too afraid to believe it when it finally does. It was her and Lilia. Then her and Billy. Now - her and Rio. Strays taking in strays. </p><p>Then Rio glances down at the two of them tangled in bed, a crooked little smile tugging at her mouth.</p><p>“I mean, this whole week’s been one surprise after another. I really didn’t think this,” she gestures between them, “was gonna happen.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. Loud, warm, sudden. “Yeah, well. You and me both.”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. “That a bad surprise?”</p><p>Agatha just shakes her head and lets herself fall forward, lips brushing over Rio’s again. </p><p>“Not even close,” she mumbles. </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s the phone waking Rio the second time this morning.</p><p>Ringing against the nightstand now, loud in the quiet room. Rio stirs, opens one eye. Her head’s foggy, heavy. Feels like they only just fell asleep.</p><p>Agatha’s still on her arm. Dead to the world. Her face tucked into Rio’s bicep, mouth parted slightly, breathing slow and even. Peaceful. Rio shifts a little. Her back aches, but she doesn’t move. Doesn’t want to.</p><p>The phone rings again.</p><p>“Agatha,” she murmurs, voice scratchy.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>She lifts a hand, brushes fingers through Agatha’s hair. “Agatha. Phone.”</p><p>Still nothing. Just a sleepy grumble and Agatha pressing her face deeper into her arm.</p><p>Rio smiles, half-asleep still. Figures this is probably how Agatha found her earlier this morning. </p><p>“Come on,” she tries again, voice low near her ear. “You’ve got a call.”</p><p>Another groan. This one louder. Agatha finally blinks awake, squinting toward the nightstand before she leans up to snatch her phone. Her hair’s a mess, perfect. Rio watches her, lips twitching.</p><p>“Hey, Alice,” she mumbles, voice low.</p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything. Just shifts behind her, hand sliding over her waist like she’s reminding Agatha she’s still here. That she heard.</p><p>There’s a pause while Alice talks. Agatha doesn’t respond right away.</p><p>Rio kisses her shoulder.</p><p>Soft. Just once.</p><p>Agatha hums at whatever Alice is saying. Doesn’t pull away.</p><p>Rio trails another kiss higher, up her neck this time. Slow and open-mouthed.</p><p>She can feel Agatha’s body tense, just slightly, but she doesn’t move. Doesn’t stop the call.</p><p>Instead, Agatha cuddles back into her. Subtle. A shift of her hips. The tiniest nudge like she’s inviting more.</p><p>So Rio listens to the invitation. Starts dragging kisses across the side of her throat, deliberately unhurried. Lets her tongue sneak out against the skin there.</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Agatha says into the phone, voice more breath than words.</p><p>Rio hides her smile against Agatha’s neck and starts to move downward, leaving a slow trail of kisses. Barely-there nips between them.</p><p>She gets to the edge of the blanket. Slides it down a few inches. Her mouth finds the top of Agatha’s chest. Warm skin. Steady heartbeat.</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches—just a little.</p><p>Rio keeps going.</p><p>Then she hears it. The shift in Agatha’s voice.</p><p>“Fine, Alice,” Agatha says, a little rougher now. “Tell me your plan.”</p><p>Rio glances up.</p><p>Agatha’s looking straight at her. Eyes dark. Fixed. Steady.</p><p>And yeah—she’s not even pretending to listen anymore.</p><p>She’s watching her.</p><p>She bites gently just below the swell of Agatha’s chest. Just enough to mark. Not enough to bruise.</p><p>The reaction is instant.</p><p>Agatha gasps—sharp and unfiltered—before slapping her hand over her own mouth. Her eyes go wide like she’s surprised by herself.</p><p>Rio stays right where she is, mouthing over the spot she just bit. Softer now. A kiss in apology or maybe a warning.</p><p>She glances up.</p><p>Agatha’s already looking down at her, biting her lip so hard it might bleed, her fingers still loosely over her mouth. Her other hand gripping the phone tighter now.</p><p>“Yeah, Alice,” she breathes, voice slightly wrecked. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Her gaze doesn’t move. Doesn’t blink.</p><p>Rio raises a brow, presses another kiss just above the last one. She doesn’t say anything. </p><p>Agatha swallows.</p><p>“So we have Ralph do what now?” she asks into the phone, almost like she didn’t just stutter over her own breath.</p><p>Rio smiles against her skin.</p><p>This is fun.</p><p>She kisses lower, tongue dragging slow. A breath against skin. A graze of teeth over the soft edge of Agatha’s hip.</p><p>She hears it—the moan.</p><p>It slips out of Agatha before she can catch it, raw and needy, immediately muffled by her own hand again.</p><p>Rio glances up. Watches Agatha’s jaw clench, watches her blink like she’s trying to concentrate.</p><p>Doesn’t give her time to recover. She kisses the other hip. Nibbles. Waits for the reaction—and gets it. Another stifled sound, another buck of Agatha’s hips like her body is completely separate from her brain.</p><p>Rio grins.</p><p>“Y—you know what, Alice?” Agatha cuts in, voice frayed and fast. “Let’s talk about this in person.”</p><p>Her eyes are on Rio. Blown wide, lip pulled between her teeth now.</p><p>Rio’s right there. Right above where she knows Agatha wants her most.</p><p>She leaves a kiss just above her center. Just a press of her mouth, soft and slow.</p><p>Agatha jolts.</p><p>“Also can you bring food?” she says, barely sounding normal. Trying. Failing. “Yeah—maybe breakfast burritos? From that café?”</p><p>Rio looks up at her, catching her expression—wrecked and struggling and somehow still gorgeous. She licks her lips once, then drops her head again and swipes her tongue once, teasing, just enough to make a point.</p><p>Agatha’s whole body arches.</p><p>“Yeah. The one in Eastview.” Her voice catches.</p><p>Rio can feel her pulse there.</p><p>“I’m—Alice—I’m hungover,” Agatha says, breath hitching. “I want some greasy food to help.”</p><p>Rio presses another kiss. Firmer this time. Purposeful.</p><p>“Okay. Yeah. Yeah thank you,” Agatha rushes, clearly barely hanging on. “I love you. Bye.”</p><p>She hangs up fast. Throws the phone onto the carpet without looking where it lands.</p><p>Rio’s smirking by the time she looks back up at her.</p><p>“Fuck—” Agatha gasps.</p><p>Her hips buck again, desperate and shameless now, chasing contact, chasing anything. But Rio pulls back, grinning like sin.</p><p>“We just keep getting interrupted,” she murmurs, voice low, rough with control. She swipes her tongue once more through slick heat, slow and pointed, before pulling away again.</p><p>The taste of Agatha is still on her tongue.</p><p>She sits back on her heels slightly, watching her, loving how wrecked she already looks. “Did you really want breakfast burritos, Agatha?”</p><p>She leans back down, nose brushing against her thigh before she kisses her center again—mouth pressed right between folds, tongue teasing but not generous.</p><p>And that’s when Agatha’s eyes snap down to hers, sharp and dark. </p><p>“Are you really complaining that I just bought us time?” she breathes. “You know Alice was going to end up showing up anyway.”</p><p>Rio knows she’s right. Of course she is. Alice would’ve come barreling in much earlier without having to get burritos. But that doesn’t mean she’s not going to tease her for it. Not when Agatha looks like this—spread out, flushed, already dripping.</p><p>So she pulls back. Completely.</p><p>Hands on her hips, holding her down when she tries to chase. “Stay,” she says, almost sweet.</p><p>And then she starts kissing up Agatha’s body—mouth dragging over soft skin, across ribs, the underside of her breast, biting lightly there just to hear Agatha suck in air. She finally slides her hips between Agatha’s thighs again, presses down against her, dragging the hard line of her core into wet heat.</p><p>It’s dizzying. The contact. The want.</p><p>She leans down, frames Agatha’s face with her forearms like she’s bracketing something holy, and kisses her slow.</p><p>“It sounds to me like you wanted the time, Agatha.”</p><p>She rolls her hips down, grinds in.</p><p>Agatha gasps—high and rough—grinding up into her in return, their bodies sticky, flushed, too far gone for it to be anything but need now.</p><p>“Do you want me to beg, Rio?”</p><p>God. Yes. That’s exactly what she wants. That’s all she’s ever wanted. Agatha—smart, sharp-mouthed Agatha—breathless and begging under her.</p><p>But then Agatha leans up, chest brushing against hers, nipples dragging over skin, and Rio shivers.</p><p>And then—then—Agatha nips her earlobe, breath hot and slick against her skin.</p><p>“Or want to skip to the part where you fuck me with a strap?”</p><p>Jesus Christ.</p><p>Rio’s breath punches out of her. Her hips jerk down without thinking, grinding rougher into her, and she hears herself groan—deep and low and ragged.</p><p>Yes—okay—let’s definitely skip to that part, Rio thinks, already sliding her hands down Agatha’s thighs to pin her.</p><p>“Where?”</p><p>Agatha lets out the lightest laugh, smug and breathless all at once, then leans back on her elbows and points. “Top drawer. That dresser.”</p><p>Rio’s off the bed in a blink—nearly trips over herself trying to move fast enough. Almost embarrassing. Almost. She yanks the drawer open—and there it is. Sitting front and center. The strap. Purple. Harness folded neatly next to it.</p><p>Rio blinks.</p><p>Same harness. Exactly the same as hers.</p><p>She would laugh if she wasn’t currently seconds from climbing back onto Agatha like a starving woman. But Jesus. Same vibrators. Same harness.</p><p>But it’s okay. At least she knows how to work it.</p><p>She steps into the harness smoothly, hands steady, buckling each strap in place with a soft click, cinching them until it fits snug against her hips. It sways slightly as she moves, enough to make her aware of the faint pressure against her own center—just enough bump to tease her through the inside panel.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>She takes one step toward the bed.</p><p>Then another.</p><p>And Agatha—Agatha’s staring at it. At her. Legs parting like instinct. Like a reflex. Her eyes are glassy, dark with want, but trained right between Rio’s legs. Her hair’s still a mess from sleep, from Rio’s hands in it. Her lip caught between her teeth. Neck flushed to the collarbone.</p><p>And that look. That fucking look she gives her.</p><p>Like Rio’s the only thing she sees.</p><p>Rio swallows hard, because standing there, fully strapped, watching Agatha open up for her without being touched—it’s almost too much.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Rio moves slowly, knees sinking into the mattress as she climbs back up the bed, the strap swaying gently with every step. It catches on the sheets once—just a flick—but it’s enough to make her breath hitch. Enough to make her feel it. Her hands come up to steady herself, one on either side of Agatha’s body, and the second she’s close enough, Agatha’s hands are curling around the back of her neck and pulling her down.</p><p>Their mouths meet in a kiss that’s all heat and want—messy and impatient.  Rio smiles into it, and kisses her deeper. Dirtier.</p><p>Every bit of restraint she’d had a minute ago? Gone. She shifts her weight to one arm so she can trail her free hand down Agatha’s side, brushing over the soft dip of her waist, following the curve down to her hip. She grabs it firm and glances down.</p><p>Her fingers wrap around the base of the strap and she lines it up, just right. But she doesn’t press in yet.</p><p>She lets it drag. Slow. Lazy. Letting it slide through Agatha’s folds, slick already.</p><p>Each pass earns her a twitch from Agatha’s thighs. A hitched breath. A low, involuntary sound that has Rio’s whole body tightening in response. She watches the way Agatha shifts. The way she bites her lip. The way her chest rises just a little quicker.</p><p>And when Rio finally looks up again, Agatha’s staring back—barely.</p><p>Blue eyes gone almost black. Half-lidded. Hungry.</p><p>Then a nod. </p><p>She presses in slowly, careful to let Agatha take her time. Inch by inch until her hips are flush against her. The heat of her, the tightness, has Rio swallowing hard even though she’s not the one being touched like this.</p><p>Agatha’s nails dig into her back. Sharp, biting. Rio freezes on instinct.</p><p>But then they trail down. Curl into her hips. Press.</p><p>“Please,” Agatha breathes.</p><p>And fuck.</p><p>That single word unravels her completeley. </p><p>Rio moves slow. Steady.</p><p>Each thrust is controlled, deliberate—just enough to make Agatha gasp softly beneath her. That first oh spills out like a reward, and it nearly knocks the air out of Rio’s chest. Her mouth drops to Agatha’s neck without thinking, kissing the warm skin, biting gently when their hips meet again. Every grind sends that perfect wave of pressure curling up from her own center. Building.</p><p>She could chase it. She could lose herself in it.</p><p>But she doesn’t.</p><p>Because every sound from Agatha—every needy moan, every hitch of breath—is better than anything Rio could feel. She wants them. Craves them. She times every push of her hips to drag another out. She keeps the pace slow, consistent, even when her legs start to tremble. Even when her own release starts curling low and hot in her belly.</p><p>Then she shifts just slightly. Rolls her hips instead of snapping them, lets them grind together just right—and Agatha makes a noise she wasn’t expecting. Louder. Wrecked.</p><p>Rio pulls back just far enough to see her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are shut tight, mouth parted in the prettiest, desperate little way. Her neck’s flushed, her chest rising quick.</p><p>And God, Rio’s legs are barely holding her up.</p><p>Because she did this. She made her look like that.</p><p>An angel, she thinks. An actual angel.</p><p>But she needs more.</p><p>She needs to see her.</p><p>“Agatha,” she breathes, low and rough. Her hand finds Agatha’s cheek, thumb brushing gently. “Open your eyes for me, sweetheart.”</p><p>They snap open instantly—blue, blown wide and glassy—and then flutter closed again.</p><p>Rio’s hips snap harder the next time they meet.</p><p>“Keep them open for me.”</p><p>Agatha gasps, the pressure catching her off guard—but this time, she obeys. Her eyes lock with Rio’s and stay. </p><p>Rio exhales hard through her nose, trying to hold herself steady even as her arms tremble from the strain, from the sharp edge of pleasure scraping inside her with every grind of their hips. Her breath hitches as Agatha clenches around the strap, making it harder to pull back. </p><p>Still, she doesn’t stop.</p><p>She keeps the pace firm, rhythm tight, and lets her hips roll just enough at the end of each thrust to pull a louder sound from Agatha’s mouth. She watches her face—eyes glassy, lip bitten red, jaw slack with moans that are getting higher, sharper.</p><p>Rio feels her own pressure spike again, nearly stealing her breath.</p><p>But she keeps her focus on Agatha.</p><p>Always on her.</p><p>“You okay?” she manages, voice hoarse, words slipping out between ragged breaths. Her hips never stop moving.</p><p>Agatha nods, but the look in her eyes is wrecked.</p><p>“Fuck—” She sucks in a sharp breath, her hand gripping tighter at Rio’s waist. “Yeah—I think I’m gonna come, Rio.”</p><p>Rio grits her teeth and pushes in deeper. </p><p>Agatha’s thighs shake around her waist. And then it happens—Agatha snaps. Her eyes nearly roll back, her whole body locks up before she’s almost yelling—fuck.</p><p>Rio doesn’t break eye contact.</p><p>Watches a single tear slip out from the corner of Agatha’s eye.</p><p>She keeps going, even when it gets harder to press in—Agatha clenching so tight it nearly knocks the air out of her. The tightening in Rio’s stomach is brutal now. She ducks in a breath through her nose, trying to hold on.</p><p>Agatha catches hers, just barely, and then she’s pulling Rio down and kissing her. It’s messy. Deep. Her eyes flutter closed. When Agatha pulls back, Rio doesn’t open hers—just rests their foreheads together, panting against her mouth.</p><p>“Fuck, baby,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>Rio groans. Almost helpless.</p><p>“Can you come like this?” Agatha asks. Breath still uneven.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snap open. “Fuck—yes. I can.”</p><p>Agatha’s staring back at her, grinning. “Then use me to come, baby.”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Yeah. She’s dead. Okay.</p><p>Still she presses deeper and harder into Agatha, grinding faster and faster. She’s chasing it with her hips, being spurred on by every little gasp Agatha lets out beneath her. A soft, “Baby,” being moaned out is what throws her over the edge. </p><p>Rio comes hard—deep and drawn out, pulled straight from somewhere guttural. She grunts into Agatha’s neck, burying her face there, pressing as deep as she can inside her like it still somehow isn’t enough. The pressure, the heat, the ache.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” she breathes, voice all rough and torn apart. “You did so good for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands are in her hair, stroking slow and soft, grounding her. Rio stays there, heavy on top of her, letting her body relax one muscle at a time. Her breathing evens out, but her limbs are still shaking. Agatha doesn’t say anything—just keeps petting her hair, one hand curling around the back of her neck.</p><p>Eventually, Rio lifts her head, and Agatha kisses her once. Then again.</p><p>“Let’s get up and shower before Alice gets here,” Agatha says, still sounding wrecked. “And no funny business this time, okay? I can't afford that water bill.”</p><p>Rio laughs under her breath but nods.</p><p>They get up slow. Rio’s legs feel like jelly, and Agatha’s not exactly walking in a straight line either. The shower is quicker this time with less wandering hands, though they still can’t help but steal a few kisses under the spray, mouths slick and warm and slow. One of Agatha’s hands presses at the small of Rio’s back while she kisses her temple like she doesn’t even realize she’s doing it.</p><p>Afterward, Agatha tosses Rio a pile of clothes—soft, worn-in sweatpants and a hoodie. Rio pulls the hoodie over her head, smells the faint scent of lavender and something distinctly Agatha, and sits on the edge of the bed to put on her socks.</p><p>It should feel weird.</p><p>This—</p><p>Borrowing clothes, slipping into domestic routines, getting dressed in someone else’s room while their best friend is probably already driving over to plan how to ruin a wedding.</p><p>This would freak her out with anyone else.</p><p>But not here. Not now.</p><p>With Agatha, it feels almost normal. </p><p>Agatha pulls her to the kitchen by the wrist, warm fingers wrapped tight. They don’t make it there uninterrupted - she steals kisses in the hallway, backs Rio up against the wall, then again against the counter, both of them grinning into each other’s mouths while the coffee brews behind them. </p><p>The smell starts to fill the kitchen. Agatha pulls back with one last kiss to her jaw, then gestures to the bar stools.</p><p>“Sit,” she says, already reaching for mugs. “How do you take your coffee?</p><p>Rio’s about to answer when she hears it—keys in the front door. The sound of them clattering against the wood before the click of it swinging open. Then: heavy, familiar combat boots on hardwood, the kind of entrance no one but Alice would make.</p><p>She doesn’t even see her first. She hears her.</p><p>“Well, well, well,” comes Alice’s voice, already dripping with amusement. “What do we have here, hot stuff?”</p><p>And there she is. Sunglasses still on indoors like she owns the place, bag of food in one hand, keys and phone in the other, smirk etched so deep it may as well be tattooed on her face.</p><p>Agatha turns, entirely unbothered. “Hi Alice. Coffee?”</p><p>Alice tosses the food on the counter like she’s lived here for years. “Yes please.”</p><p>Her eyes flick back to Rio. “Busy morning?”</p><p>Before Rio can roll her eyes or throw back a snarky retort, Agatha’s already handing her a cup of coffee and cutting in, voice dry.</p><p>“Oh please, Alice. You already knew.” She grabs the bag of food and holds it up. “There’s three burritos in here.”</p><p>Alice just grins, taking the coffee. </p><p>“Where’s the fun in that?” she says.</p><p>Rio shakes her head but can’t help the small smirk pulling at the edge of her mouth. She grabs her burrito from Agatha’s hand with a small thank you. </p><p>Alice leans her hip against the counter, nursing her coffee like it’s a lazy Sunday and not the calm before some sort of well-dressed war.</p><p>“I had a heart-to-heart with Jen last night,” she says, almost casually.</p><p>Agatha, mid-bite of her burrito, lifts her brows and speaks around her food. “Well? What’d you say?”</p><p>Rio watches the scene, amused. Agatha looks adorable with chipotle sauce on her lip, hair still damp and hoodie way too big—but it’s possibly the cutest thing she’s ever seen.</p><p>Alice sets her coffee down with a quiet clink. “She asked if I thought she was making a mistake.”</p><p>Rio watches her. No smirk. No sarcasm. Just quiet.</p><p>“I told her I couldn’t say that for her,” Alice goes on. “That it’s her call. But I want her to be happy. No matter what.”</p><p>Agatha nods. </p><p>And Rio—she believes her. All of it. She’s not lying. Not twisting words. Just leaving out the part where they plan to burn this wedding to the ground. But the thing is, Rio thinks she means it. She wants Jen to be happy. Even if it means making sure she doesn’t go through with the whole marrying Ralph thing. </p><p>Agatha’s halfway through her burrito when Alice tilts her head, watching her a little too closely.</p><p>“Wait a second,” Alice says slowly, setting her coffee down. “You don’t like the burritos from Eastview. You always say the eggs are too runny—”</p><p>She cuts herself off as realization hits. “Oh. Ew.”</p><p>Rio watches the scene unfold like she’s at a theater show she didn’t know she had front-row seats to.</p><p>Agatha freezes, like she’s been caught red-handed.</p><p>Alice doesn’t miss a beat. “You were having sex when I called you, weren’t you?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer. Not immediately. Just blinks at Alice and chews slower. </p><p>Rio steps in before it spirals, voice dry. “Alice. The plans. Three days to take down a wedding, remember?”</p><p>And just like that, the grin is back on Alice’s face—wide, wicked, almost feral. “I’m so glad you asked.”</p>

<p>Agatha doesn’t even get the chance to respond to Alice’s ominous “I’m so glad you asked,” before Rio’s phone starts to buzz on the counter.</p><p>Rio glances at the screen and winces a little. “Sorry,” she mutters, already backing away, hoodie sleeves pushed up, jacket still unzipped. “One sec.”</p><p>Agatha watches as Rio answers the call, heading for the hallway.</p><p>“Hey, Kate. Yeah, but… not a lot of time,” she says, voice trailing lower as she disappears out of view.</p><p>Agatha watches her go. Every step, every sway. The way the hoodie hangs off her hips, the sound of her voice slipping as she walks away. She waits until the last bit of Rio’s silhouette disappears from the kitchen doorway before she turns back.</p><p>Alice’s eyes are already on her.</p><p>“So,” she says, leaning one elbow onto the counter with a smirk, “how good is the sex, really?”</p><p>“Alice!” Agatha groans, head dropping to her hands.</p><p>Alice just cackles, clearly thrilled with herself. “What? It’s a fair question. You’ve got that post-orgasm glow. I’m jealous.”</p><p>Agatha groans again but doesn’t deny it. She’s not sure she could even if she tried. Her body’s still loose and heavy in the best way. Her lips still taste like Rio.</p><p>Alice leans in, tone turning casual. Too casual. “So… who’s Kate?”</p><p>And there it is. A twist of something sharp right in the pit of her stomach. She sits with it a second. Doesn’t respond.</p><p>Alice notices. Of course she notices. Her teasing smile dims a little, softens. “Oh honey. You’re so into her, aren’t you?”</p><p>Agatha holds her breath. Doesn’t answer right away. What would be the point? Denying it wouldn’t make it any less true. </p><p>So she nods. Once. Quiet, but certain.</p><p>Alice doesn’t say anything for a moment. Doesn’t need to. </p><p>Alice takes a slow sip of her coffee, then tilts her head. “Do you think she feels the same way?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer right away. Because fuck if she knows.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>No.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>All of them feel true. </p><p>She turns her eyes back to Alice’s, shrugging one shoulder. “Doesn’t matter,” she says. Simple. Final. She takes another sip of her coffee to punctuate it. “She’s going back to New York.”</p><p>And that’s the truth of it, isn’t it? Nothing else really matters.</p><p>Alice’s stare lingers. Heavy. Agatha doesn’t meet it. Just swirls her mug, staring at the light ripples of coffee inside.</p><p>Then she hears it—Rio’s footsteps returning down the hall, sock covered footsteps soft against the floor. Agatha straightens slightly, almost without thinking.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio says, slipping back into the kitchen. “Okay, Alice. Plan?”</p><p>Agatha watches Alice blink like she forgot she was even holding coffee, eyes flicking between the two of them like a slow-motion tennis match. Left. Right. Left again. Then she snaps out of it.</p><p>“Right, so.” Alice sets the mug down. “Tonight’s dinner’s at Evanora’s. I’m sure there’ll be some sacrificial lamb or whatever—blessing the wedding before the meal, because that’s the vibe—but Rio, you’re going to sit next to Jen.”</p><p>Alice is full-blown into strategy mode now. “Then it’ll go Billy, Agatha, me, and—”</p><p>Agatha listens. Kind of. Her brain picks up pieces, drops others. Selective hearing. The rest is white noise.</p><p>Because she’s looking at Rio.</p><p>Who’s watching Alice talk. Her mouth is a little parted like she’s trying not to laugh. Amusement clear behind her eyes. Like she finds the whole thing a little absurd. But she’s listening. She’s engaged. She’s present.</p><p>And then—she catches Agatha looking. Just for a second.</p><p>And Rio smiles. Just for her.</p><p>A little wider. A little softer. </p><p>Then Rio shifts her foot under the table and taps it gently against Agatha’s.</p><p>Not hard. Not demanding. Just a tap.</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches—stupid, small—but by the time she exhales, Rio’s attention is already back on Alice. Focused. Calm.</p><p>Like nothing happened.</p><p>Agatha swallows and looks back at her coffee. Warm. Bitter. Real.</p><p>She should really start listening again.</p><p>But Agatha can feel it happening. That slow crawl of panic under her skin.</p><p>Nothing shows on the outside—she’s too good at that. Years of practice. Of swallowing things down so deep they start to feel like a part of her.</p><p>Alice is still talking. Her voice fading in and out. Something about Jen. Dinner seating. Evanora’s dinner - what to eat, what not to eat.</p><p>Agatha stares into her coffee. Nods once. She has no idea what she just agreed to. Because she’s spiraling now. Fast.</p><p>Did Rio feel the same way?</p><p>Yes. Right?</p><p>God, it felt like yes.</p><p>She asked to continue this. She stayed in bed, waiting—while Wanda bulldozed the morning like she always fucking does. She held Agatha’s face in her hands and listened. Actually listened. Not out of pity. Not just to be kind. She asked questions. She wanted to understand.</p><p>That has to mean something.</p><p>Still—Agatha couldn’t answer Alice earlier. Couldn’t make herself say it out loud.</p><p>Because Rio’s still leaving.</p><p>That hasn’t changed.</p><p>Maybe she’d visit more, with this new building sister-thing happening with Jen—but that’s not the same. That’s not here. That’s not staying.</p><p>Rio’s life is in New York.</p><p>Agatha’s is… here.</p><p>Billy. Lilia. Jen. Alice. The shop. The windows she picks the displays for. The plants she forgets to water. The drawer that always sticks in her kitchen. This is her world.</p><p>How the fuck is she supposed to get through this?</p><p>What happens when Rio leaves and she’s still standing in the same place, but somehow feels like something got pulled out of her?</p><p>A sharp kick to her shin pulls her violently back.</p><p>“Jesus—” she hisses under her breath, blinking hard.</p><p>Alice is smirking. “You’re welcome. Spiral later, drama queen.”</p><p>Agatha straightens, clears her throat. “Sorry. Sorry. Great plan, Alice.”</p><p>Alice cackles. “Don’t even pretend you were listening. Rio’ll catch you up.”</p><p>She’s already standing, grabbing her empty coffee cup and putting it in the sink. “I’m leaving before I’m turned into salt for being in this house of sin.”</p><p>She leans down, kisses Agatha’s cheek—soft but teasing. Then waves at Rio. “Later, hot stuff. And seriously—don’t be late again. I’m not covering for you just because you can’t figure out how alarms work.”</p><p>Before Agatha can respond, the door’s closing behind her.</p><p>Rio turns back toward her with that low, easy smile. “How much time do we have before we need to leave?”</p><p>It grounds Agatha more than she expects—pulling her out of the mental mess she’s been drowning in.</p><p>Okay. Time. She can do time.</p><p>Dinner’s at Evanora’s. So… she needs to take Rio to her hotel. Then pick up Billy from Wanda’s. Then back to grab Rio again. Then the three of them heading to the dinner together. </p><p>“About four hours,” Agatha says, doing the math aloud. “If you want me to take you to dinner, that is.”</p><p>Rio grins. “Well, I am from out of town. Not really familiar with these parts. Definitely need some navigation help.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. What a dork. “Okay, yeah. So, I drop you off, get Billy, come back, and we leave from here in four hours.”</p><p>Rio pushes out of her chair, and then she’s leaning over Agatha—close enough that Agatha has to tilt her chin up to see her.</p><p>“Do you trust me?”</p><p>And fuck. That question.</p><p>Last time Rio asked her that, she ended up seeing god in a spa hotel bed with her knees shaking and her heart practically falling out of her chest.</p><p>So yeah.</p><p>Yeah, Agatha trusts her.</p><p>Maybe this time she’ll meet God for real and skip the emotional spiral about her feelings.</p><p>Agatha nods, just once, and Rio dips down, kisses her like she already knew the answer.</p><p>Deep. Slow. Unfair.</p><p>By the time Rio pulls back, Agatha’s still trying to catch her breath.</p><p>Rio walking away. Then coming back—holding Agatha’s keys like a goddamn challenge.</p><p>“Either you trust me to drive your car,” Rio says, jangling the keys lightly, “or I tell you where to go. Your choice.”</p><p>Agatha blinks up at her. Then she stands. “You scratch her, and I kill you.”</p><p>Rio just smirks. “Noted.”</p><p>Agatha lets her drive.</p><p>No questions. No teasing about her parallel parking skills. No fake protest as Rio climbs into the driver’s seat of her car, adjusts the mirrors, settles her hand on the wheel like she’s done it a thousand times.</p><p>Just—fine. Let her surprise her.</p><p>
<em>Do you trust me?</em>
</p><p>It keeps echoing in her head, repeating like a pulse. And the answer’s still yes. Of course she does.</p><p>They don’t go far at first. Rio mutters something about how there’s not enough caffeine in all of Westview to support her habits, and Agatha laughs, lets her stop for more coffee. Rio comes out with two drinks, sets one down in the cupholder, then pulls back onto the road like she owns it.</p><p>Agatha just watches her.</p><p>She doesn’t mean to, but she does. The way Rio moves. The set of her jaw. The ease of her shoulders as she leans into the curve of the road. She looks… relaxed.</p><p>Rio’s hand drops onto her thigh somewhere outside of Main St. Like it’s nothing. Like her fingers don’t curl just slightly into the fabric of Agatha’s pants, warm and easy and—</p><p>But she doesn’t move. Doesn’t speak. Just looks out the window, letting the moment settle.</p><p>They’re nearly at the edge of town when Agatha finally breaks the silence.</p><p>“So,” she says, flatly. “If you murder me and dump my body out here, I’m haunting the shit out of you. I’ll make your dating life a living hell.”</p><p>Rio snorts, pulls up to a stop sign.</p><p>Then turns to her—completely serious.</p><p>“Agatha,” she says, voice low and calm, “I mean this with my whole heart—if I was going to kill you, I’d wait until the end of the wedding. So at least we could have more sex first.”</p><p>It’s so dry. So deadpan. And Rio looks so genuinely sincere that Agatha’s laugh breaks right out of her. Loud and surprised, filling the car. She leans in quick and presses a kiss to the side of Rio’s mouth, light but warm.</p><p>“Okay, Michael Meyers,” she mutters. “Focus on the road, please.”</p><p>Rio’s laughing now, already pulling through the stop. “Michael Meyers? Really? You’re not gonna pick a better horror icon?”</p><p>“I don’t know anything about horror,” Agatha says, waving her hand. “Can’t watch it. Freaks me out too much.”</p><p>There’s a beat.</p><p>Then Rio glances over at her, smile slow and a little surprised. “Me neither.”</p><p>Agatha looks out the window again, but her smile lingers too.</p><p>Rio pulls off on some side road Agatha’s never noticed before. And that’s saying something. She’s lived in Westview her whole damn life. This road?</p><p>Never seen it.</p><p>It’s narrow, uneven, barely wide enough for her car, with trees reaching in on both sides like they’re trying to keep it hidden. Agatha sits up a little straighter, watching as the road winds tighter, deeper into nowhere.</p><p>Maybe Rio is going to murder her.</p><p>But then the car slows. Stops. Rio glances over with a look that says stay put, and gets out. Agatha watches the door shut, listens to the hum of the engine while Rio moves ahead, unhooking a chain-link gate that’s practically swallowed whole by the overgrowth. She’s careful with it, but practiced. Like she’s done this before.</p><p>The gate creaks open and Agatha doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t ask.</p><p>Rio drives through. Re-hooks the gate behind them.</p><p>They follow the gravel path as it curves out of sight—and then around the bend—</p><p>It hits her.</p><p>Whatever joke she had about spooky murder spots dies in her throat.</p><p>Because it’s beautiful.</p><p>Like—undeniably, absurdly, achingly beautiful.</p><p>She vaguely catches that Rio had put the car in park and opened her door. Agatha just stayed and looked out the window. Then Rio was opening the door for her and holding out her hand to help her out of the car. And it was sweet. </p><p>But Agatha’s attention was captured. </p><p>By all of it. </p><p>All of this. </p><p>Overgrown and crumbling and forgotten by time, but so- so beautiful. </p><p>There’s a stone archway just ahead, half-covered in ivy, the lettering on top too faded to read. Agatha can’t tell if it used to say “Welcome” or “Private Property” or something in Latin, but it doesn’t matter. Past it, the ground opens up into what looks like an old garden. Or maybe a retreat center. Some kind of outdoor sanctuary. There’s stone steps leading down to nowhere, flowerbeds overflowing with wild things—green vines snaking through cracked benches, tree roots lifting the edges of once-paved paths.</p><p>It’s not kept.</p><p>It’s not pretty in the usual way.</p><p>But there’s something about the way nature’s taken over—soft and unbothered and alive—that knocks the wind out of her.</p><p>A cluster of tall wildflowers leans against an old fountain. A rusted iron gazebo sits half-swallowed by trees. The wind kicks through the overgrowth and sends leaves trailing on the overgrown paths. </p><p>Agatha blinks.</p><p>She’s never seen this before.</p><p>Not just the place—this. This feeling. This part of Westview. This…other side of it. Like a little pocket universe Rio just unlocked.</p><p>And she’s struck, hard and sudden, by the fact that Rio knew it was here. Rio, who doesn’t live here anymore. Rio, who could have taken her anywhere. Who chose to take her here.</p><p>Agatha turns her head slowly. Rio’s watching her.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha says quietly, “so…not a murder spot.”</p><p>Rio grins.</p><p>“Not this time.”</p><p>“How the fuck do you know about this place?”</p><p>She means it. Really means it. Because this doesn’t feel like something you just stumble across. This feels like some buried fairytale.</p><p>Rio shrugs, still watching the overgrown path ahead.</p><p>“I found it one day. After my dad died,” she says simply. “When the bookstore was closed or during the summer—I’d hide out here.”</p><p>Agatha turns to her, slower now.</p><p>Rio’s voice is soft, but not shy. Just matter-of-fact. Like this is something she’s carried long enough to be gentle with.</p><p>“I watched the flowers change with the seasons,” she continues, “and this was where the whole florist idea came from.”</p><p>It hits Agatha right in the chest. She looks around again—at the wild green spilling through cracks and the faded stone paths swallowed by weeds—and feels it. The way something can grow even when everything else is falling apart.</p><p>She wants to kiss her.</p><p>She really, really wants to kiss her.</p><p>And for once it’s not about the pull or the heat or the distraction. It’s just—this. Just her. This piece of Rio she hadn’t expected.</p><p>“Honestly, I didn’t think—”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t let her finish.</p><p>She kisses her instead.</p><p>Rio smiles into it. Hands soft on her waist. Warm. Familiar. And something more.</p><p>When they pull back, Agatha’s still close, still needing to know.</p><p>“So,” she asks, a little quieter now, “have you shown anyone else this?”</p><p>She doesn’t want to ask. Doesn’t want to know if someone else has already shared this version of Rio. But she has to.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flutter open. She shakes her head.</p><p>“No. This was just mine. My place.”</p><p>That answer does something to Agatha. Unhooks something in her ribs.</p><p>And then Rio’s pulling back. Light on her feet. “C’mon then,” she says, already moving forward. “I want to see how it’s held up.”</p><p>They wander. For maybe an hour. Maybe more.</p><p>Agatha loses track of time somewhere between Rio pointing at a wild tangle of Queen Anne’s lace and a half-collapsed trellis choked in honeysuckle. She latches onto Rio’s arm at some point and doesn’t let go. Lets herself listen. Really listen. Even when she doesn’t know the names of what Rio’s pointing out.</p><p>She feels her phone buzz once. A text. Probably Alice.</p><p>She doesn’t check it. Doesn’t need to.</p><p>But she does catch the time.</p><p>Two hours.</p><p>She stops Rio just before they reach the car. Pulls her close. Close enough that Rio’s pressed fully against her—Agatha’s back warm against the passenger’s side door.</p><p>“Thank you,” she says, low, like a secret. “For showing me this. I’ve never been surprised like this before. Not in Westview.”</p><p>Rio beams at her. One of those real, bright smiles that starts in her mouth but makes it all the way to her eyes.</p><p>“Don’t share this with anyone,” she says, just as quiet. “I don’t want to come back here and find it trampled by humans.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. No way in hell.</p><p>“Our little secret,” she promises.</p><p>And then she’s pulling Rio down to kiss her again.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio feels the car slow down as Agatha pulls up in front of the hotel, still mid-sentence about dinner timing.</p><p>“Forty-five minutes,” she says, checking the dash like she doesn’t trust it. “I’ll pick you up.”</p><p>Rio nods, smiling at her. “I’ll be ready.”</p><p>Agatha leans over, presses a kiss to her lips—quick, soft, like muscle memory—and then she’s already pulling back, and Rio’s getting out of the car. Agatha driving off to grab Billy. </p><p>Rio doesn’t move. Not at first.</p><p>She stands on the curb, watching the car disappear around the corner like maybe that’ll help it feel less like she’s being left behind. Not that she is. Just—alone. For a bit. </p><p>Eventually she exhales and heads inside.</p><p>The hotel room is quiet when she gets in. Too quiet. Cold in that fake, controlled kind of way that doesn’t match the weather outside. Sterile. Impersonal. Just another pause between places. Between people.</p><p>It’s not home.</p><p>She shrugs off her jacket, lets it fall over the armchair. Walks straight to the small vanity under the window, the one with terrible lighting and a mirror that’s slightly tilted. Grabs the outfit she laid out earlier. Button-up, clean slacks. Safe. Simple. Neutral enough to sit  near Evanora without giving her anything extra to comment on.</p><p>She already did most of the work earlier. Back at the house after coming back from the garden. Rio styled her hair and used some of Agatha’s makeup while Agatha got ready as well. </p><p>Agatha had been getting ready in her bedroom—standing in front of the mirror, brushing out her curls like it was no big deal. Like it wasn’t the most hypnotizing thing Rio had ever seen.</p><p>It had been—</p><p>Well. Mesmerizing.</p><p>Lipstick. Rings. Perfume she can still smell on the collar of her shirt. Soft floral, probably expensive. Definitely intoxicating.</p><p>Now it’s just her. Alone. Hair already done, makeup finished. Outfit on. Nothing left to get ready except her mind, and that’s the part that won’t settle.</p><p>She sits on the edge of the bed. Pulls out her phone.</p><p>That email’s still there. The one from Kate Bishop.</p><p>Rio had answered her call earlier today and all Kate had said was she was sending the contract and needed it back at the end of next week.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>Kate Bishop — Bishop Events</strong>
</p><p><strong>Subject line:</strong> Proposal &amp; Contract for Rio Vidal</p><p> </p><p>She taps it open again like maybe it’ll look different this time. </p><p>She opens the PDF.</p><p>Big events. Huge, really. The kind that come with six-figure budgets and a client list full of influencers and galleries and wedding planners with their own PR teams. Guaranteed exposure. Guaranteed bookings. Social media reach that would’ve taken Rio three years and a small miracle to build on her own.</p><p>It’s a lot of money.</p><p>Like—a lot.</p><p>Enough to ease up. Cut back store hours. Maybe close the shop a couple days a week and still come out ahead. Maybe finally stop living at the edge of every invoice. Maybe just say yes to what she wants. Take the clients she loves. Work with the flowers that make her feel something instead of just what’s in season and on sale.</p><p>It’s everything she thought she wanted.</p><p>And yet—</p><p>
<em>Twelve consecutive months</em>
</p><p>Three words. Staring back. No—glaring.</p><p>She lets the phone fall beside her on the bed, screen face-up like it’s daring her to pick it back up. She doesn’t.</p><p>Instead, she leans back against the headboard. Closes her eyes. Feels the stiffness in her shoulders. The way her stomach won’t unclench. The weight of it all pressing into her ribs, low and steady like a bruise.</p><p>She should be proud. She should feel lucky.</p><p>She just feels—</p><p>Still.</p><p>Like her body hasn’t caught up yet. Like her head’s in three places and none of them are here.</p><p>She stares out the window. The sun’s starting to dip behind the trees, dragging warm gold across the skyline. Westview doesn’t really have one—no high rises, no sharp edges. Just soft light and slower hours. Roofs and trees, not towers. The kind of quiet that makes you think too much.</p><p>Her fingers drum against her leg.</p><p>Forty-five minutes.</p><p>She checks her phone. Okay, thirty-seven now.</p><p>Agatha will be back soon. Billy in the backseat. Rio will slide into the passenger seat. Smile like she’s fine. Say something dumb to make Billy laugh. Pretend she hasn’t been thinking about the contract the entire time. Pretend she hasn’t been thinking about Agatha even more.</p><p>Her body finally starts to relax.</p><p>Just a little.</p><p>She lets her eyes close again, the sun warm against her face through the window.</p><p>Thirty-six minutes.</p><p>She might even drift off.</p><p>She startles at her phone chiming.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p>we’re out front</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs her keys off the nightstand, gives herself one last glance in the mirror. She looks fine. More than fine. But she doesn’t feel anything like it. She slides her phone into her pocket and heads out.</p><p>Agatha’s car is parked right by the front doors, still idling. Rio walks up, opens the passenger side door, and there’s Billy already grinning in the backseat.</p><p>“Hey, Rio! So good to see you again!”</p><p>She smiles back, genuine. “Hey, Billy. Good to see you too. You ready for tonight?”</p><p>Billy gives a flat-lined smile, “Let’s see - Evanora’s house with total strangers except you, Agatha, Jen and Alice. I’ve never been more thrilled.”</p><p>Rio laughs, not expecting the sarcasm, “Right there with ya, bud.” She climbs into the passenger seat and buckles her seatbelt. She lets out a deep breath and glances over at her. Agatha’s still wearing that lip gloss. The one Rio had watched her apply with careful precision earlier while pretending not to stare.</p><p>Agatha starts, “Hey honey - Alice has some sort of scheme tonight—which, shocking. I know. But Rio needs to tell me the plan again. Rio, can you remind me?”</p><p>Oh right. The plan. </p><p>Rio didn’t think she’d be looping Agatha’s son into the whole sabotage Jen’s wedding thing but Agatha’s asking, so she will. She clears her throat. “Sure. So, my job is to distract Jen at dinner—keep her talking, keep her entertained, whatever that looks like.”</p><p>“Easy,” Agatha murmurs. </p><p>“And Billy here,” Rio turns her head toward the backseat, “he’s gonna help me out. He’ll sit next to Jen and me. Ask questions. Keep Jen’s focus away from Ralph.”</p><p>Billy nods, “Okay, I’ve already got loads of questions I’ve been thinking about anyways.” </p><p>Rio’s about to continue, but Agatha gets to it first, “What kind of questions, honey?” </p><p>“Oh! Yeah - just like plant questions I’ve been wanting to ask Rio.” Rio’s feels heat in her ears. She feels Agatha’s gaze on her but she’s still looking back at Billy. </p><p>“Perfect,” Rio says, grinning at him. “You’ll be my wingman.”</p><p>“Cool.” he says, dead serious.</p><p>“And you and Alice,” Rio adds, turning back to Agatha, “are going to focus on Ralph. Steer the conversation that way. Alice said all you have to do is help her with the talking. Which—don’t ask me what that means, because I have no clue - she didn’t even tell me what she was going to say to him.”</p><p>Agatha hums, thoughtful. “Helping Alice with conversation. That feels like walking into a trap.”</p><p>Rio snorts. “Probably.”</p><p>“But I can do that,” Agatha says, mostly to herself. “I can talk.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze flicking toward her mouth again before she turns back to the road. “You definitely can.” She says it low, just enough that Agatha can hear it. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond except with a nose twitch and a small smile, focused on the road in front of her. Then she starts asking Billy about the book from this morning. </p><p>She watches Agatha drive for a second, that same knot from the hotel room settling in her chest.</p><p>She’s not sure if this plan is going to work - she’s not even sure there is a real plan except keep Jen occupied while Alice says whatever she wants to Ralph. </p><p>She’s not sure about the contract - she just keeps getting stuck on the whole twelve consecutive months part. </p><p>Rio’s pretty sure she’s not sure about anything. </p><p>Except - she’s sure she likes being sat next to Agatha. </p><p>Even if she’s not staying. Even if this is temporary.</p><p>Even if it’s all about to fall apart. </p><p>Still—Agatha’s next to her. </p><p>Talking about Billy’s book.</p><p>——</p><p>They pull into Evanora’s driveway and the dread hits her like clockwork.</p><p>The kind that settles in her gut, heavy and old. Doesn’t matter how nice the house looks in the early evening light—clean porch, fresh paint, those too-perfect bushes lining the walk—it still feels like a mausoleum. Cold and sharp around the edges.</p><p>Billy’s already unclipping his seatbelt before the car’s even in park. Agatha doesn’t move.</p><p>“Billy,” she says, just loud enough. “We’ll catch up. Go ahead.”</p><p>He gives a thumbs up and keeps going, jogging up the porch steps just as Jen opens the front door. She spots him, grins wide, and pulls him into a hug—arm wrapping around him, whispering something in his ear. Her laugh echoes before the door clicks shut behind them.</p><p>And then—Rio barely has a second to turn back—Agatha’s lips are on hers.</p><p>A surprise. Fast and urgent.</p><p>Rio kisses back immediately, hand instinctively cupping Agatha’s cheek, grounding them both for a second.</p><p>And just as quick, Agatha pulls back.</p><p>They’re still close. Still breathing the same air. Agatha’s breath is brushing against her lips—warm puffs, soft and uneven.</p><p>She doesn’t move. Neither of them do.</p><p>Rio’s voice is low when she speaks, still catching up to what just happened. “What was that for?”</p><p>Agatha just smiles, small and soft. “You look good. That’s all.”</p><p>Rio watches her for a beat longer. Agatha’s eyes are steady. Her mouth is still pink from the kiss.</p><p>Rio glances down at the clock on the dash. Twenty minutes before they’re supposed to be seated inside, pretending everything’s fine.</p><p>She exhales slow. “Evanora’s got a greenhouse,” she says, voice casual but threading a line between hope and mischief. “It’s where I’m keeping all the flowers for the wedding.”</p><p>Agatha arches a brow. “You’re storing them here?”</p><p>“Didn’t have a choice,” Rio says, already reaching for the door handle. “But I do have to check on them. Make sure everything’s still upright and hydrated and untouched by disaster.”</p><p>Agatha’s watching her closely.</p><p>Rio shrugs, meeting her gaze. “Want to come with me?”</p><p>She doesn’t say before we walk into that house or before I have to pretend this place doesn’t make my skin itch. She’s pretty sure Agatha already knows anyhow. </p><p>But, Agatha’s already nodding. “Lead the way.”</p><p>And Rio’s already climbing out, heart hammering a little faster.</p><p>Because maybe this isn’t just about checking on the flowers.</p><p>Maybe she just needs a few more minutes. Just her and Agatha. Before the show starts.</p><p>They step into the greenhouse and the air shifts. Warm and thick with green. Not humid—controlled. The kind of air Rio knows how to breathe.</p><p>Agatha’s standing just inside the doorway. Blinking around.</p><p>“Wow,” she says, voice low. “Rio—there’s so many.”</p><p>Rio smiles. She gets to work. Checks the water lines, the temp gauge, the petals on the farthest batch of roses. Everything’s still holding. Healthy. Blooming. She doesn’t say it, but the flowers look perfect.</p><p>They’ll hold through the wedding.</p><p>She turns back and—</p><p>Agatha’s watching her. Eyebrows pulled together. Finger pressed to her lips.</p><p>Rio stills. “What’s that look for?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer at first. Just stares across the greenhouse like she’s trying to see through it.</p><p>Then, finally—quiet: “Nothing, it’s just…”</p><p>Rio waits. Doesn’t push. But she wants the answer.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Agatha shifts. “Jen would’ve never picked roses. Not even for a funeral, let alone her wedding.”</p><p>That stops something in Rio. She stands straighter. Feels it—panic starting to tap on the door.</p><p>“Agatha,” she says slowly , “they were in the contract. A thousand roses. I double-checked. Evanora signed. Jen called me personally. Asked to confirm. Red roses.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look away. Doesn’t even blink. “I believe you,” she says. “I’m just telling you—she hates them.”</p><p>Rio exhales. Tries to catch the crack before it gets bigger. “Then maybe it wasn’t her call.”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head.</p><p>“Could’ve been Evanora,” Rio says. “Or worse. Ralph.”</p><p>That gets a laugh. Sharp and bitter and too loud for the space.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha says, still smiling, “now I don’t feel as guilty for trying to ruin the wedding. Tragic. These beautiful flowers. Wasted.”</p><p>Rio steps closer. Not touching. But close.</p><p>Agatha looks up at her. Her smile doesn’t falter. But there’s something in her eyes now. Something deeper.</p><p>Rio leans in. Slow. Teasing. She’s so close to Agatha she can practically taste her breath—minty from the toothpaste earlier. She’s about to kiss her, just about to press their mouths together when she pulls back at the last second, grinning.</p><p>“C’mon,” she murmurs, voice low and rough. “Before Billy catches us in here.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t care. Not even a little. She closes the space between them and kisses Rio anyway—quick, firm, like she needed one more before they went back to pretending everything’s normal. “Fine,” she says against Rio’s mouth. “Let’s go.”</p><p>She turns like she means it, already halfway out of the greenhouse, and Rio’s hands move before her brain can stop them. She catches Agatha’s wrist gently, tugs her back. Not hard. Not demanding. Just enough to pull her back.</p><p>One more kiss. A little slower this time. Not desperate, not yet, but close.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio says when they finally pull apart again. Her voice is quieter now. “Don’t kiss a lot of ladies in front of a thousand roses.”</p><p>Agatha actually laughs. One of those deep, bright ones that catches Rio off guard every single time. “It would be so romantic,” she says, shaking her head, “if these weren’t the roses from my best friend’s wedding that we’re actively trying to ruin.”</p><p>And then she’s turning again, walking out like none of that just happened. Like she didn’t just say something that cracked Rio’s chest open.</p><p>Romantic.</p><p>Rio stays still for a beat too long. Watches the way the sun catches in Agatha’s hair as she walks out the greenhouse door. Watches how easily she moves, how lightly she leaves.</p><p>And the word lingers.</p><p>Romantic.</p><p>Fuck. It would be. That’s the worst part.</p><p>It is.</p><p>She’s not supposed to feel it like this—not when there’s still so much up in the air. Not when she hasn’t even signed the contract Kate sent over. Not when there’s a thousand fucking roses right in front of her that might end up in the trash if this whole thing burns down. Not when Agatha isn’t hers. Not really.</p><p>But the word is still there, stuck in her throat. Rio feels like it’s choking her.</p><p>She exhales hard through her nose and finally moves, following Agatha out and into the evening sun. The front lawn’s starting to fill in. People she doesn’t recognize, all dressed up, arriving in pairs. Light chatter from the front steps. Someone laughs too loud. The kind of sound that makes Rio feel like she’s on the outside of something.</p><p>Agatha’s a few steps ahead now, already halfway up the walk, blending in effortlessly. Rio’s not surprised. Agatha belongs in places like this. Polished and composed, even when she’s trying to quietly dismantle a wedding from the inside out.</p><p>Rio glances down at her feet as she walks, adjusting her jacket. One breath at a time. That’s the plan.</p><p>She’ll be fine.</p><p>She’s sitting next to Billy and Jen. They’ll keep her distracted.</p><p>And she’ll keep Jen distracted. </p><p>Focus on the plan. </p><p>They get seated, and Rio feels her stomach drop as soon as she sees where everyone ends up. Jen’s next to Evanora. Which means Rio’s also pretty close to Evanora. Great.</p><p>She clocks Agatha’s glance from across the table—subtle, barely a lift of her brows—but Rio catches it anyway. She doesn’t smile back. Just shifts in her seat and picks up her water.</p><p>It’s fine. She can get through this. One dinner.</p><p>The first few minutes aren’t bad. Food’s served—some fancy plated chicken and vegetables, with flowers on top that actually make Billy perk up.</p><p>“Are these real?” he asks, jabbing his fork at the petals.</p><p>Rio leans toward him. “Yeah. Those purple ones are violas, and the orange is marigold. Both edible.”</p><p>“No way.” He grins. “That’s so cool. Are they good?”</p><p>“Marigold’s a little bitter. Violas are mild though. Add some color. Some people candy them.”</p><p>Billy looks impressed. He asks another question, and another, until Rio’s talking without thinking. Just like in her shop—facts and small stories, comfort in rhythm. Aloe plants, succulents, what grows best in shade. She forgets where she is for a second. It helps.</p><p>She catches Agatha excusing herself to the restroom - has to force herself to not watch her walk away. </p><p>Jen joins in when Billy brings up aloe again. “It’s good for skin,” she says, eyes still on her plate. “Cools down sunburns, moisturizes. I used to use it all the time as a kid.”</p><p>It’s simple. Casual. Rio starts to relax.</p><p>But of course, the calm doesn’t last.</p><p>“Rio,” Evanora says, voice soft but pointed, “how’s business these days?”</p><p>It’s not an innocent question. Nothing from Evanora ever is.</p><p>Rio chews slowly. Swallows. “It’s good,” she says, short and neutral. Keep it tight. Keep it clean.</p><p>Evanora’s smile sharpens. “Well, florists can’t make too much, can they?” she muses. “I mean, my contract with you must be the best you’ve seen in months—if not years. Am I correct?”</p><p>Rio sets her fork down. She exhales.</p><p>God, she hates her.</p><p>It takes everything in her not to snap. She can feel the table shifting. Subtle glances. People pausing in their conversations. Waiting.</p><p>She shouldn’t say anything. She knows she shouldn’t.</p><p>But she’s not going to let Evanora play her like that. She can’t help herself. </p><p>“Actually,” Rio says, tone smooth but firm, “I’m negotiating a contract with a company that would set me up for the next year. Maybe longer.”</p><p>Silence, for just a second.</p><p>Evanora smiles. Tighter this time. “Good for you.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t look at her. Doesn’t give her the satisfaction.</p><p>She glances to the side instead—just in time to catch Jen’s eyes.</p><p>Her expression is… unreadable.</p><p>Not mad. Not surprised either. Just watching.</p><p>And something about it twists in Rio’s chest.</p><p>Rio looks away.</p><p>She reaches for her water again just to have something to do with her hands, her mind racing. Not because she regrets what she said—screw Evanora—but because she hadn’t told Agatha. Not about the offer. Not about how serious it was. Not about how real it suddenly feels.</p><p>And now it’s out there. In front of Jen. In front of everyone. Well - not <em>everyone. </em></p><p>Agatha just came and sat back down.</p><p>Luckily for Rio, Ralph stands up with a clink of his fork against his glass, grinning like he just invented love itself.</p><p>“To love,” he says, loud and booming like he’s at his wedding already.</p><p>Rio nearly chokes on her water.</p><p>“To love,” Ralph repeats, raising his glass higher. “To the magic that brought us together. To the soul-deep connection that withstands the tests of time. And to new beginnings—our marriage, and our move to Colorado… next month!”</p><p>He smiles like he just pulled off the greatest mic drop in engagement history.</p><p>Rio doesn’t roll her eyes—but barely. Jen and Evanora are right there. She keeps her face neutral. </p><p>She chances a glance across the table.</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows are halfway up her forehead. Alice actually mutters, “What the fuck?” under her breath.</p><p>Agatha says it out loud: “Next month?”</p><p>Jen’s head whips toward Ralph. “Next month? It was supposed to be next year.”</p><p>Ralph, undeterred, walks over to Jen and Rio, leans in toward her like this is a moment she’s going to swoon over. “I wanted to surprise you, babe! I already bought the house and everything. It’s all set. We’re gonna get a head start!”</p><p>He says it like it’s romantic. Like she’s going to leap into his arms.</p><p>Rio watches Jen blink. Twice. Her face still. Too still.</p><p>Evanora, of course, chooses now to chime in, hands clapping together softly. “Oh, this will be great! Get ahead of it before the new year! There’s so much opportunity in Colorado, Jennifer.”</p><p>And that’s it.</p><p>Jen’s jaw clenches. Her voice doesn’t rise at first—but it’s sharp. “No.”</p><p>The room stills.</p><p>“No,” she repeats. “This is not what we agreed on.”</p><p>Ralph blinks at her, like she’s the one being unreasonable.</p><p>“What do you mean? I thought this would be—”</p><p>“You thought,” Jen cuts in, her voice louder now, “without talking to me.”</p><p>She’s not yelling. Not quite. But the entire room’s quiet now. There’s at least twenty people in the dining room, forks mid-air, wine glasses paused halfway to lips. All of them frozen, watching it happen.</p><p>“This isn’t what we discussed,” Jen says. Her voice is shaking a little now. “It was supposed to be next year. What about everything here in Westview?”</p><p>“We’ll figure it out,” Ralph says, still smiling like he can talk his way through it. “I figured you’d be excited! I got us this perfect place—”</p><p>“That’s not the point, Ralph.”</p><p>There’s no mistaking her tone now. She’s not smiling. She’s not performing.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>She just sits there and watches it unravel.</p><p>Jen’s face is flushed. Ralph looks stunned. Agatha’s hand has gone tight around her wine glass. Alice is staring daggers across the table, and Evanora’s plastered smile is still frozen on her face like she can’t quite process what’s going wrong.</p><p>Rio doesn’t know all the details.</p><p>But she’s getting the picture pretty damn fast.</p><p>And it doesn’t look good.</p><p>Jen stands. “If you’ll excuse me,” she says, and she’s gone—just like that.</p><p>Alice is out of her chair in an instant. Agatha too. No hesitation.</p><p>They both follow, leaving Billy seated next to Rio.</p><p>Rio stays frozen, stunned. That wasn’t the plan. That wasn’t supposed to happen yet. They hadn’t even started the plan - not really anyway. </p><p>“Woah,” Billy mutters under his breath.</p><p>Rio exhales. Yeah. That about covers it.</p><p>Evanora stands, still somehow composed, even as the dinner guests whisper around them. “Thank you for coming to dinner,” she announces. Her voice floats across the table like the host of some dead silent game show. “I need to speak with my daughter.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenches at that. Her daughter. Hits the same every damn time.</p><p>The dining room starts clearing out. Guests murmuring, collecting purses, coats, awkward glances passed like secret notes.</p><p>Rio turns to Billy. “C’mon. Let’s go find something to do.”</p><p>He looks up at her, eyebrow raised. “What, don’t wanna be in that room?”</p><p>Rio snorts. “Not especially. And I’m not leaving you to fend for yourself.”</p><p>Billy laughs, and Rio steers them both out through the back door. It’s cooler now. Evening. She leads them back toward the greenhouse, one of the only spaces on this property that feels like hers.</p><p>Once they’re inside, Rio checks on the roses again, even though she already did it earlier. All of them look the same—fed, upright, undisturbed. But Billy’s the one who gets wide-eyed.</p><p>“Whoa,” he says, walking the row like he’s at a museum. “There’s so many.”</p><p>“Thousand roses,” Rio says. “Every one of them accounted for.”</p><p>He hums, crouching to peer at a bloom. Rio leans back against one of the counters, arms crossed. She lets herself breathe. The greenhouse smells like soil and cut stems and sunlight trapped from earlier. Not peace, exactly. But close enough.</p><p>It’s quiet for a bit. Billy doesn’t seem to mind. He just drifts from one flower to the next, totally fascinated.</p><p>Then, casually, too casually, he says, “So… don’t shoot the messenger—”</p><p>“Oh Jesus,” Rio mutters, already bracing. “What?”</p><p>Billy shrugs. “But… why does Wanda hate you so much?”</p><p>Rio closes her eyes for a beat. Of course.</p><p>“She doesn’t hate me,” Rio says, trying to keep it light, but her voice comes out flatter than she wants. “She just… has opinions.”</p><p>“Yeah, she told me you were selfish and that you always leave,” Billy says, still crouched by a flower like he’s talking about the weather.</p><p>Rio blinks. Jesus Christ. Wanda really is harsh. “Wow. Direct quote?”</p><p>He nods. “Pretty much. I mean, she said it nicer, but like… not really?”</p><p>Rio lets out a breath, scrubs a hand down her face. “Great. Cool.”</p><p>Billy stands. “But I don’t think you’re that bad.”</p><p>“That bad, huh?” she echoes.</p><p>He grins. “I mean you just saved us both from whatever’s going on in there. And you seem to make Aunt Jen happy. And Agatha- even Alice a little bit.”</p><p>Rio huffs a laugh, but there’s a knot in her stomach she can’t quite untie. Wanda. Bad-mouthing her. To Billy. She doesn’t even know what part of her Wanda told him about. Doesn’t really want to know.</p><p>Rio snorts and lets her head fall back against the wall. “Yeah - they uh - they’re making me pretty happy too.”</p><p>And for a moment—it’s quiet again. The only place on the property where no one’s fighting. </p><p>She hears footsteps. Sharp ones, purposeful. Rio glances toward the greenhouse door, straightening up a little. Thank God. Agatha, probably. Come to find them. Ready to drive them both back and get the hell out of this nightmare dinner.</p><p>But the person who turns the corner isn’t Agatha.</p><p>It’s Jen.</p><p>Rio blinks. Surprised, but maybe not as much as she should be. Tonight’s been one thing after another. What’s one more?</p><p>“Hey,” Jen says, lingering in the doorway. “Agatha’s inside. She’s looking for you.”</p><p>Billy steps toward her, already moving, polite as always. “Thanks,” he says.</p><p>But Jen stops him with a hand on his arm before he gets through the door. “Hey—thanks for putting up with all the wedding stuff. I know it sucks. But you’ve been awesome.”</p><p>Billy softens at that. Smile kind of shy. “Anything for you, Aunt Jen.”</p><p>And then he’s gone, walking back toward the house. They both watch him go.</p><p>Jen’s quiet for a second longer than is comfortable.</p><p>Rio shifts her weight. Waiting. Bracing.</p><p>Jen turns back around, takes a slow step into the greenhouse. Her eyes move over the space. The rows of roses. The careful work.</p><p>“Wow,” she says. “Rio. These are… gorgeous.”</p><p>Rio huffs out a dry laugh. “You don’t have to lie, Jen. Agatha told me. You hate roses.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes snap back to hers. Sharp. A little defensive.</p><p>“You’re right. I do hate them.” She takes another step closer. “But I still think the work you would’ve done with them is beautiful.”</p><p>It hits right in the chest. Too fast. Too much.</p><p>Would’ve.</p><p>Rio swallows. Her throat suddenly feels thick. Tight.</p><p>She tries to shake it off, to joke, but it doesn’t come out right. “Would’ve done with them, huh?” she says, voice thinner than she wants. “Did you call it off?”</p><p>Jen’s mouth pulls into a frown. Like maybe she hadn’t meant to say it like that. Like maybe she’s realizing the weight of her own words just now.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Jen says quietly. “Maybe.”</p><p>Rio just nods, her hands still dug into the counter behind her. Silent. Because if she opens her mouth right now, she’s not sure what would come out.</p><p>Jen crosses her arms, still looking around at the roses like she’s searching for something to say. Rio figures maybe this is where the conversation ends. But then Jen speaks up again, “So what’s the company you’re signing with?”</p><p>Rio’s caught off guard for a second. “What?”</p><p>“That contract. You mentioned it at dinner.”</p><p>Oh. Right. That.</p><p>Rio lets out a slow breath, shifts back against the counter again. “It’s with Kate—Kate Bishop. She runs a high-end events firm out of the city. Has a ton of corporate clients, a lot of money thrown around for centerpiece bullshit. But she’s good. She’s solid. And she’s giving me a full year’s contract, booked out.” A pause. “Guaranteed.”</p><p>Jen nods, taking it in, expression unreadable.</p><p>Then Rio adds, quieter, like she’s admitting something she shouldn’t be: “I haven’t signed it yet.”</p><p>Jen’s eyebrows shoot up. “Then why the hell did you tell mom that you did?”</p><p>Rio shrugs, but there’s tension in her shoulders. “Because I didn’t want to deal with her. Evanora acts like being a florist is a fucking hobby. Like I should be grateful she gave me your wedding. It was easier to shut her up than explain why I haven’t signed yet.”</p><p>Jen narrows her eyes. “Mom didn’t give you the wedding, I asked for you.” Jen shakes her head, “Doesn’t matter. why haven’t you signed yet?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer.</p><p>Not right away.</p><p>She knows why. And it has nothing to do with the ink or the logistics or the client list. It has everything to do with a plan she and Agatha made that suddenly doesn’t feel as clear-cut. Everything to do with a goodbye she’s supposed to say in a few days, and how it might not be as easy as she told herself it would be.</p><p>She clears her throat. “I will. It’s not like I’m backing out. I just… haven’t made it official yet.”</p><p>Jen quirks an eyebrow. Still watching her. Still too sharp.</p><p>“When are you going to tell Agatha?”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Jen walks out of the dining room, and Agatha’s already on her feet. Alice is right behind her. The three of them trail down the hallway before they end up in Jen’s old bedroom. </p><p>Same paint. Same queen-sized bed with the curved headboard and fairy lights still hanging above it like some kind of time capsule. Agatha’s eyes flick to the shelves—still lined with books Jen probably hasn’t touched in years. She doesn’t know why she notices that.</p><p>Jen’s pacing now. Barefoot, furious, muttering to herself like she’s halfway to losing it.</p><p>“I can’t believe this. I can’t believe I have absolutely no control over my life.”</p><p>Alice tries to step in. “Okay, hey, sit down, let’s just—”</p><p>She reaches out gently, hand to Jen’s elbow. Jen brushes it off without a second thought, still pacing, still spiraling.</p><p>Agatha’s had enough.</p><p>“Jen.” She doesn’t respond or stop. </p><p>Louder, “Jen.” </p><p>Nothing. Okay. Full naming the woman then - loud. </p><p>“<em>Jennifer</em>.”</p><p>It snaps her like a whip. She freezes mid-step, eyes wide like she forgot they were even in the room.</p><p>“Let’s all sit,” Agatha says, motioning to the bed. “Come on.”</p><p>Jen doesn’t argue. Not really. She just exhales, sharp and shallow, and drops onto the edge of the bed like her knees gave out. Alice hovers a second longer before sitting beside her. Agatha stays standing for now, close but not crowding them.</p><p>“Okay,” she says. Calm. Solid. “Deep breath.”</p><p>Jen does it. Not gracefully. Not easily. But she does it.</p><p>Agatha nods once. “Let’s talk about this, Jen. What are you thinking?”</p><p>Alice jumps in too fast, too loud.</p><p>“Yeah—Colorado?! You can’t go to Colorado!”</p><p>Agatha shoots her a look. Sharp. Just enough to cut.</p><p>“Alice. Not important right now.”</p><p>Alice clamps her mouth shut, eyes darting between them.</p><p>Agatha turns back to Jen. Quieter this time. “What are you thinking?”</p><p>Jen’s eyes flick up to meet hers. Tired. A little wet around the edges, but not crying. She’s trying to keep it together. Trying to breathe.</p><p>Agatha waits. Doesn’t fill the silence.</p><p>Jen exhales like it physically hurts. Like the breath itself weighs something.</p><p>“I’m not doing it,” she says finally, voice low. “I’m not making any more decisions just for everyone else. I can’t.”</p><p>Alice reaches out, rubs both hands along Jen’s arms like she’s trying to calm a storm. Jen doesn’t shake her off this time.</p><p>“He can’t do that. Ralph can’t just make that decision. Go behind my back, tell everyone we’re moving to Colorado like I don’t even get a vote. Like I’m just gonna follow him because he’s already packed the car.”</p><p>Agatha stays quiet. Watches her.</p><p>“And Mom—” Jen laughs, bitter, short. “She’s been planning my entire life since I was in high school. Maybe earlier. You remember that, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha does. Clear as day. Jen in that exact room, furious because Evanora had given her a timeline. University, internships, engagement by twenty-eight. The dress. The venue. A four-bedroom house and a golden retriever. Like it was a job application she’d already failed if she wanted something different.</p><p>“She picked the date,” Jen’s still going. “She picked the colors. The venue. The stupid favors. You know I didn’t even choose the damn band? Ralph did. And she approved it. They didn’t even ask me.”</p><p>Alice mutters, “That’s insane,” but Jen’s already rolling, voice sharper now.</p><p>“The dress? I didn’t pick the dress either. I tried on one that I liked and mom made a face and that was it. She said it didn’t suit me. That I should wear something timeless.”</p><p>She goes quiet for a second. Then quieter.</p><p>“I asked if Rio could come just to do the flowers,” she says. “And she got mad. Said it would be a distraction. Said it was stupid to even bother.”</p><p>Agatha feels something twist in her chest.</p><p>“Maybe we weren’t close,” Jen keeps going, eyes on the floor now. “Maybe we didn’t grow up braided-at-the-wrist close. But she’s my sister. My sister. And she got upset. Like that wasn’t allowed.”</p><p>Agatha shifts closer, kneels in front of her. She wants to reach out, but doesn’t yet.</p><p>“Jen,” she says, soft but firm. “You’re allowed to want your sister at your wedding.”</p><p>Jen nods. Slowly. Like she’s just now giving herself permission to believe it.</p><p>Jen keeps going. “I don’t know what’s going to happen,” she says, dragging both hands through her hair, pacing again. “But I cannot do this anymore.” She turns, meets Agatha’s eyes. “Like—maybe Rio’s out of the will or whatever, but at least she’s free of it. She doesn’t have to sit through dinners pretending to agree with mom. She doesn’t have to fake it through a wedding she didn’t choose.”</p><p>Agatha stays quiet, but the words hit sharp. Not because they’re wrong. No - because they’re true.</p><p>“I was always so envious of her,” Jen continues. “How Mom never tried to control her. Not really.”</p><p>And Agatha thinks—because she can’t help it—Evanora didn’t control her because she hated Rio. Because she made sure Rio knew exactly where she stood. Rio just told her that. But Agatha doesn’t say it. Not now.</p><p>“I watched her this week,” Jen’s voice softens, like she’s talking to herself more than them. “And I don’t even know her that well, not really. But damn—she just does whatever she wants. Doesn’t second guess. Doesn’t apologize. Doesn’t worry about the fallout until it’s in front of her.”</p><p>Agatha swallows. </p><p>“I want that,” Jen says. “I need that. I want to want something and not immediately hear Mom’s voice in my head telling me why I shouldn’t.”</p><p>Silence settles over the room like a weighted blanket. Thick. Heavy.</p><p>“I can’t marry Ralph,” Jen says. Not a whisper. Not a scream. Just… final.</p><p>Agatha stands, wraps her arms around her without hesitating. “We’re here for every step, babe.”</p><p>Alice folds in on the other side, sniffling. “Plus, who needs Evanora’s money anyway? I’ve seen your savings. You could do that skincare line you’ve always wanted.”</p><p>Jen actually laughs. Wet and tired and real. She wipes her eyes with the back of her hand. “Maybe I’ll just follow Rio to New York. Mooch off her and her big new contract.”</p><p>Agatha stiffens. Pulls back just slightly. “Wait. What contract?”</p><p>Agatha catches it immediately—the look Alice gives her. Quick, subtle, but not subtle enough. Like she knows something she shouldn’t. Like she’s waiting to see how Agatha reacts.</p><p>Then she looks at Jen. Same look.</p><p>Jen doesn’t say a word. But her eyes are saying plenty.</p><p>Alice jumps in before Agatha can ask. “She just mentioned it at dinner. The contract. Said she’ll be set for like… the next year, working events in New York.”</p><p>New York.</p><p>And fuck does that do a number on Agatha’s chest. Like someone reached in and pulled a thread loose.</p><p>Because she should be happy. </p><p>She is happy for her. </p><p>It’s exactly what Rio deserves—traction, money, freedom.</p><p>But that contract isn’t here. That contract is in New York.</p><p>Jen nods like it’s no big deal. Like this is all normal. Like Agatha’s lungs aren’t suddenly tightening like fists.</p><p>“Yeah,” Jen adds, casually, but she’s watching her. Really watching. “She seemed - I don’t know, proud maybe? Seems like a big deal kind of thing.”</p><p>Agatha feels everything all at once. Heart pounding. Skin prickling. A little dizzy.</p><p>She could puke. Or scream. Or get in her car and drive somewhere far enough that it doesn’t hurt to think about Rio leaving.</p><p>But instead she just nods. Once. Sharp.</p><p>“Good for her,” she says, voice even. Flat. A lie wrapped in pride.</p><p>Because it is good. And she is proud. </p><p>But she’s not happy about it. </p><p>And it still hurts like hell.</p><p>And then -</p><p>Jen hums, quiet but sharp. “Is it?”</p><p>Agatha blinks. “Is what?”</p><p>Jen leans forward. “Is it good for her?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, quick. “Of course it is. It’s a huge opportunity. I’m—” her voice goes tight, “—I’m happy for her.”</p><p>Jen doesn’t blink. “Agatha, you’re allowed to be upset about Rio’s contract.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrow. “Why would I be upset about your sister’s contract?” </p><p>What the fuck does Jen know?</p><p>Silence stretches. Alice is staring at Jen now, mouth slightly open. Agatha watches them both, something turning in her gut.</p><p>Jen just shrugs, like the answer’s obvious. “Come on, Agatha. I’m not stupid. You had a hickey during the facial.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach drops. Her spine goes rigid. She opens her mouth—no, fuck, what is she even supposed to say to that? Her voice scrambles to defend her before her brain can catch up. “That wasn’t a—”</p><p>Jen holds up a finger. “Don’t lie.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth shuts. Hard.</p><p>“I knew this whole time,” Jen says, voice low. “Come on, you were flirting with her at the bar. I saw it.”</p><p>Agatha blurts, fast, panicked, “I didn’t know it was Rio at the time—”</p><p>Jen cuts in without missing a beat. “Sure. But what about you being insanely jealous over the  waitress at the spa resort? Or the fact that you were very much in the middle of something when I brought you your extra room key? Or that you both conveniently missed breakfast?”</p><p>Agatha wants to melt into the fucking floor.</p><p>Jen keeps going, not cruel, just honest. “What about when I drove you home, and Rio stayed? Do you really think I didn’t notice all of that?”</p><p>Agatha presses her lips together. She’s not sure if she’s mad or embarrassed or just unraveling.</p><p>“Don’t lie to me,” Jen says, softer now. “I’m not mad. Not about that. You seem… happy. Or lighter. Different than when you were with Wanda.”</p><p>Agatha blinks fast. Those words, specifically—happy—lands like a bruise.</p><p>“I am mad you hid it from me,” Jen says, “but I get it. I get why you did.”</p><p>Agatha exhales and softens, reaching across to touch Jen’s arm. “Oh, honey. I’m sorry. I didn’t want to add more stress to you—not during your wedding.”</p><p>Jen lets out a surprised laugh, shaky and real.</p><p>Before Agatha can respond, Alice throws her hands up. “Oh thank fuck. I’ve been dying to talk about this forever with you guys.”</p><p>Jen snorts, shakes her head, but her smile’s still there. Agatha arches a brow at her. </p><p>Jen shifts, voice quieter now. “Agatha… you deserve to be happy too. Especially after the last few years.”</p><p>That lands. That one stings in a different way. Not in a bad way, just… deep.</p><p>“And Billy loves her,” Jen adds. “So yes - you are allowed to be upset about the contract.”</p><p>Agatha swallows. Her hands twist together in her lap. “We, um — we agreed that this would be over. After your wedding. Whatever this - us - is.”</p><p>Silence settles over the room again. Jen looks down. Alice looks at Jen. Neither of them speak for a beat.</p><p>Then Alice leans forward, voice softer than usual. “Yeah, but that girl looks at you like you put the moon in the fucking sky, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenches. She feels it everywhere—her throat, her chest, her ribs. It hurts. It aches. Like the wind’s been knocked out of her.</p><p>Jen claps her hands once. “Okay. I’ve made a life-altering decision tonight. Both of you need to make one as well.”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “Oh yeah?”</p><p>“Yes. Agatha, you’re talking to Rio. And Alice—don’t think you’re getting out of this. We’ll figure one out for you. But both of you are going to make a decision that makes you happy. Mine was possibly cutting myself out of my mother’s very, very large will. No pressure.”</p><p>Agatha laughs under her breath, “Low stakes. Got it.”</p><p>Jen smacks her knees and stands up. “With that being said—I’m going to get some air before Mom finds me.”</p><p>They watch her slip out the door, and it’s quiet for a second.</p><p>Then Agatha turns to Alice. She’s still seated, still grinning like a damn Cheshire cat.</p><p>“You should talk to her, Agatha,” Alice says, voice light, teasing. “At the very least, you’ll get really hot sex out of it.”</p><p>Agatha laughs—quiet and genuine. “You’re disgusting.”</p><p>Alice shrugs. “I’m not wrong.”</p><p>Agatha shifts. “Fine. But what are you going to do, huh?”</p><p>Alice’s smile softens just a touch. A little more real. “I’m going to tell her.”</p><p>Agatha blinks. “Tell who what?”</p><p>Alice pushes herself off the bed, heading toward the door.</p><p>“I’m going to tell Jen I’m in love with her.”</p><p>Agatha’s brain short-circuits. </p><p>“What.”</p><p>Alice’s already in the hallway.</p><p>“<strong>WHAT</strong>?” Agatha bolts after her. “Alice get your ass back here!”</p><p>Alice just laughs as she disappears down the hallway. Agatha’s left standing in the doorway, hands on her head, completely losing her mind.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha.”</p><p>She jumps.</p><p>“Jesus—Billy,” she breathes out, hand to her chest. “You scared the hell out of me.”</p><p>He grins like it was on purpose. “Sorry. Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart softens immediately. “I’m good, sweetheart. Just wanted to make sure Aunt Jen was okay.”</p><p>Billy nods, satisfied. “Rio showed me the roses.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he says, eyes wide. “Do you think we’ll get to see them put to use?”</p><p>Agatha laughs under her breath. “No, I don’t think so, honey.”</p><p>Billy sighs with pure relief. “Oh thank God. I love Aunt Jen, but I don’t think I could sit still in that itchy tux through the whole wedding.”</p><p>That earns a real laugh from her. </p><p>“Come here,” she says, ruffling his curls. “Let’s take a second before we find Rio.”</p><p>They duck back into Jen’s room for a breather. Billy flops onto the bed like he owns the place, arms folded behind his head, legs too long now to not hang off the edge. </p><p>“You okay?” she asks, voice soft.</p><p>“Yeah.” He shrugs.</p><p>Agatha lowers herself onto the edge of the bed beside him. For a second, they sit in the kind of stillness that only comes after chaos. The kind that makes you realize how tired you are.</p><p>“I like Rio,” Billy says suddenly.</p><p>“Oh, yeah?” Agatha answers, casual. Reflexive.</p><p>Where the fuck did that come from?</p><p>“Yeah, when you and Alice ran after Jen she showed me the greenhouse so we weren’t trapped in that dining room.”</p><p>“I’m glad she got you out of there, honey. I’m sorry I ran after Jen.”</p><p>“It’s okay. I need to say sorry to her though.”</p><p>Agatha turns a little to look at him. “Sorry, for what?”</p><p>“I told her what Wanda said about her and I shouldn’t have—I was just trying to tell her that I liked her being around.”</p><p>Her chest tightens. That familiar, low-grade panic that always bubbles up at the mention of Wanda. She straightens a little.</p><p>“What—um—what did Wanda say, honey?”</p><p>Billy glances at her, then away, like he’s debating if it’s worth repeating.</p><p>“Oh. Um… she just says she leaves all the time. That she’s selfish. Or something.”</p><p>The words hit like a cold slap. She feels her jaw tighten. Of course Wanda said that.</p><p>“She said that to you?”</p><p>“She didn’t mean to,” Billy says quickly. “She was just… talking. She does that thing where she thinks I’m not listening.”</p><p>Agatha breathes in slowly. Nods like it’s no big deal even though her blood is running hot. She’s not mad at Billy. Not even a little. But Wanda? Jesus.</p><p>She leans back on her hands and looks up at the ceiling. “Well,” she says finally, “I think Wanda just has some very strong opinions on her.” She turns her head toward him. “Do you think Rio’s selfish?”</p><p>“Oh—no. Definitely not.” He shakes his head, firm.</p><p>She lets out a slow exhale. “Well, it’s settled then—Wanda’s crazy.”</p><p>Billy laughs at that, a real deep laugh. It’s the best sound in the world. </p><p>She reaches over and squeezes his shoulder, standing up. “Come on, honey. Let’s grab Rio and get out of here, shall we?”</p><p>He nods enthusiastically, and they get up at the same time. Walking out of the room, she wraps an arm around him. They round the hallway corner—Agatha still warm with the weight of him leaning into her side.</p><p>They catch Rio by the front door, already looking ready to bolt. Agatha can tell just from the way she’s standing—shoulders tight, jaw set, eyes scanning for the nearest escape.</p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “Ready to blow this popsicle stand?”</p><p>Rio’s nodding before she’s even finished the sentence. “Let’s get the fuck out of here, please.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything, just smiles and reaches for the front door. </p><p>They climb into the car, doors shutting quickly like they’re completing a heist . Agatha turns the key in the ignition and shifts into drive, but it’s like her body’s moving on autopilot. </p><p>Because fuck.</p><p>That conversation with Jen has settled into her chest like cement.</p><p>Rio’s contract.</p><p>She grips the steering wheel a little tighter. She has to talk to her. Tonight. Jen basically assigned it to her. And Agatha’s not pushing her luck with Jen any further. The woman knew everything. </p><p>She pulls onto the main road while Billy starts firing questions at Rio about plants—again. Something about sunlight or maybe watering schedules? She’s not really hearing it. Just Rio’s voice answering in that casual way, slipping in a joke now and then to make him laugh.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t register half of it. Her mind’s racing. Spinning through timelines and endings and New York contracts and hickeys and Rio’s mouth and—fuck.</p><p>Before she knows it, she’s turning onto Wanda’s street. Billy’s already unbuckling. He hops out and then stops at her window, waiting. She rolls it down with a faint smile.</p><p>“Should I not tell Wanda about the wedding?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a tired laugh. “You don’t need to lie to her, honey.” She sighs, rubbing a hand over her face. “But… maybe don’t bring it up unless she asks, alright?”</p><p>Billy grins. “Okay.” He leans in further, waving across her toward Rio. “Bye, Rio. Bye, Agatha.”</p><p>“Bye, sweetie,” she calls, watching him walk up the walkway, all long limbs and carefree ease. A beat passes. Then another. </p><p>Rio turns toward her, finally. “Where to next?” she asks, voice gentle. </p><p>“Let’s go back to my place,” Agatha says, trying to sound casual. “There’s wine there at least.”</p><p>Rio laughs softly, a bit more ease to her posture. “Okay, Agatha - as you wish.”</p><p>The car falls into a gentle silence as Agatha merges onto the highway, headlights cutting through the dim wash of the evening. She’s fine. This is fine. She just has to—talk. Say it. Ask. Something.</p><p>And then, both of them open their mouths at the same time.</p><p>“Can we—”</p><p>“I think—”</p><p>They both stop, startled by the timing.</p><p>Rio glances over. “Ladies first.”</p><p>Agatha exhales a smile. “Can we talk ?” she asks, flicking her gaze toward Rio quickly before returning her focus to the road.</p><p>Rio’s smile fades just slightly, replaced with something more grounded, serious. She nods. “Of course, Agatha. That’s what I was going to ask you too.”</p><p>Agatha stares ahead, jaw tightening, willing herself not to react. But she feels it anyway. That wave of nerves, crashing harder with every mile they close between them and her front door. Maybe she’s going to say she’s leaving. Maybe she’s going to say it’s over because there’s no wedding and she’s going back tonight. Because the whole plan is off. Because New York —</p><p>A warm hand lands on her thigh.</p><p>She jumps slightly, not from fear but from the way it pulls her right out of her head.</p><p>Rio’s voice is softer now. “Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha glances at her again. The concern in Rio’s eyes is clear, and her thumb is rubbing slow, grounding circles against Agatha’s leg.</p><p>“Yeah?” she manages, voice rougher than she wants it to be.</p><p>Rio hesitates for half a beat. Then she says, “I need to tell you about work. My work.”</p><p>Agatha nods once, swallowing hard.</p><p>Rio doesn’t let go of her leg. And then she starts. </p><p>“It’s about the call I got earlier today,” she says, voice low, thumb brushing slow and steady against Agatha’s thigh. “It’s from a woman named Kate Bishop. She owns or is part of this high-end event planning company in New York. Real deal. She’s been looking for a florist.”</p><p>Agatha keeps her eyes straight ahead, trying to breathe like it’s normal. Like her lungs aren’t tight.</p><p>“The contract’s…” Rio exhales a quiet laugh. “It’s ridiculous, Agatha. Financial freedom. Straight up. A monthly retainer that would cover everything. Rent. Groceries. I could stop taking bad clients. Stop doing back-to-back parties every weekend just to keep my business above water.”</p><p>She pauses, her fingers stilling for just a second, then moving again.</p><p>“I could be picky. Finally. Choose the projects I actually care about.”</p><p>Agatha nods once. She remembers the call now—Rio stepping outside the kitchen this morning with her phone when Alice came over. She didn’t think anything of it at the time. </p><p>Rio goes on. “I mentioned it at dinner. I think you were in the bathroom. Evanora asked me something and—I don’t know, she got under my skin. Like she always does. I blurted it out. I didn’t want to hide it from you, I just hadn’t figured out how to tell you yet.” </p><p>Agatha cuts in, gently, “Okay. But— not to burst your bubble but Rio, Jen told me about the contract. After dinner.”</p><p>Rio’s head snaps around, brows furrowed. “What?”</p><p>“Yeah, she told me after she ran out of the dining room. Just said it sounded like a big deal and you had signed with that company.”</p><p>“No.” Rio shakes her head immediately. “No, I didn’t. That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. I haven’t signed it.”</p><p>Agatha blinks. Staring at the road but not seeing it. “You haven’t…”</p><p>“No,” Rio says again, more firmly. “It’s sitting in my inbox. I read it. Reread it. Reread it again. But no, I haven’t signed. Not yet.”</p><p>Agatha finally turns her head. Her voice is soft, barely a breath. “Why?”</p><p> </p>

<p>She clears her throat. “I will. It’s not like I’m backing out. I just… haven’t made it official yet.”</p><p>Jen quirks an eyebrow. Still watching her. Still too sharp.</p><p>“When are you going to tell Agatha?”</p><p>———</p><p>Rio stills.</p><p>Like—body freezing, pulse skidding to a stop. Hands pausing mid-fidget with a button on her shirt. The air in the greenhouse suddenly too warm, too still.</p><p>And Rio hates that she says it like it’s so obvious. Like it’s easy.</p><p>“Why would I tell Agatha?” she says, sharper than intended.</p><p>Jen crosses her arms. Leans her hip against the potting table like she has all the time in the goddamn world. “Why wouldn’t you?”</p><p>Rio lets out a breath. Looks away. The light filtering through the glass hurts her eyes all of a sudden. It’s late. The sun’s low. </p><p>“No, Jen. Why would I tell Agatha?”</p><p>Jen exhales. Loud. “Jesus, Rio.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I’ve known this entire time.”</p><p>That? That surprises her. Because Jen does <em>not</em> catch onto things very fast. <br/><br/>Rio <em>knows</em> this because she can get under Jen’s skin very fast with even a simple sarcastic comment.</p><p>Jen keeps going. “You left a hickey on her neck. And you stayed with her last night?”</p><p>Well.</p><p>Fuck. </p><p>She doesn’t even have a response to last night. She saw the look Jen gave her when they stepped out of the car. </p><p>And that hickey? That was from—shit, that was from the spa day. </p><p>Jen knew the entire time. </p><p>Jen’s voice cuts through her panic again. “Agatha already knows I know. So let’s skip the bullshit.”</p><p>Rio blinks. Eyes sharp now.</p><p>“You need to tell her about the contract,” Jen says.</p><p>Rio grips the edge of the table behind her. Tight. She knew this conversation was coming—just didn’t expect it from Jen first. And not now. Not tonight. Not with Agatha still in the house and everything already messy.</p><p>“I haven’t even signed it yet,” she mutters.</p><p>Jen doesn’t blink. “But you’re going to, right?”</p><p>Rio swallows.</p><p>She doesn’t have an answer for that.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Alice bursts into the greenhouse like she’s been sprinting. Nearly slams into the door.</p><p>“Jen!—oh. Hey, Rio. Jen, I need to talk to you.”</p><p>She’s breathless. Like actually out of breath. Rio doesn’t know if she ran or if she’s just that wound up. Either way, it’s enough to make her step back a bit.</p><p>“Do I need to leave?” Rio asks, already knowing the answer.</p><p>“Yes. Please,” Alice says, already pulling Jen toward the other side of the greenhouse.</p><p>Rio nods once. “Okay.”</p><p>She turns, halfway to the door when Jen calls after her.</p><p>“Talk to Agatha, Rio.”</p><p>Rio stops.</p><p>“You may be my sister, but she’s my best friend—”</p><p>“Hey,” Alice says at the same time, followed by a small smack on Jen’s shoulder. </p><p>“Ow,” Jen whines. “What was that for?”</p><p>Alice doesn’t even answer. She just stares at Rio instead. “She’s my best friend, Rio. Talk to her. Please.”</p><p>Rio nods again, slower this time. Something pulling at her chest. Heavy. Not bad. Just… thick. Like nerves wrapped in some weird calmness. </p><p>She heads back to the house, careful not to go too fast. Just stays near the front door. Doesn’t hear voices—doesn’t know where Billy and Agatha went off to. Maybe upstairs. Maybe outside. She doesn’t ask.</p><p>Just starts walking little laps in the entryway, slow circles like her body needs to move even if her brain’s stalled out. Her nerves are still shot. This house doesn’t help. Too big. Too cold. Too much Evanora baked into the walls.</p><p>She’s halfway through a third lap when she hears it.</p><p>“Ready to blow this popsicle stand?”</p><p>Agatha. Behind her.</p><p>Rio turns immediately. Nodding fast enough she’s dizzy. “Let’s get the fuck out of here, please.”</p><p>They get in the car and Agatha seems—off.</p><p>Not in a cold way. Just quiet. Pulled back into herself like she’s sorting through something she doesn’t want to say out loud yet. Which, fair. Jen knew the whole time. And she clearly didn’t want that.</p><p>So Rio keeps it simple. Keeps it safe. She talks to Billy instead, who slides into the backseat and immediately starts rattling off questions about the greenhouse and sunlight. About soil acidity and the best time to repot something. She answers them all, grateful for it. Grateful to have something to fill the silence. </p><p>She’s never had someone so curious about plants before. Not like this. Not a teenager, anyway. And he’s not even doing it in that impress me with your knowledge way adults always expect. He’s just curious. Wants to know how things grow. What makes them bloom. What hurts them. What helps them stay.</p><p>It’s nice.</p><p>By the time they pull up to Wanda’s apartment, the air inside the car has evened out some. The silence isn’t so sharp. Rio watches Billy unbuckle his seatbelt. She watches Billy ask about what to tell Wanda, Agatha responding and then a wave with a quick goodbye, and he’s heading up the walkway. Agatha watches too, quiet still, hands on the steering wheel like she’s bracing for something.</p><p>She doesn’t say anything yet.</p><p>And neither does Rio.</p><p>But she’s going to. </p><p>Just… needs to grow a pair. </p><p>Then she turns toward Agatha, finally. “Where to next?” she asks, keeping her voice soft. Gentle.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look at her, just shifts into gear and says, “Let’s go back to my place. There’s wine there at least.” She tries to make it sound casual, but Rio hears it—something tucked underneath the ease, trying too hard.</p><p>Rio lets out a low laugh anyway, hoping it helps. “Okay, Agatha—” she leans back, lets herself breathe a little, “as you wish.”</p><p>The car slips into silence, the kind that feels calm but full. The highway rises ahead of them, dark and steady, headlights cutting through the purple wash of dusk. Rio glances over once—Agatha’s fingers tight on the wheel. Something’s clearly pressing against the edges of her calm.</p><p>Rio feels it too. She’s been feeling it since dinner. Since before.</p><p>She wants to talk. Say it. Ask. Something. Anything.</p><p>And then—both of them at once:</p><p>“Can we—”</p><p>“I think—”</p><p>They stop, blinking at each other, caught in the timing.</p><p>Rio gives a little tilt of her head. “Ladies first.”</p><p>Agatha exhales a faint smile, quick and tight. “Can we talk?” she asks, barely looking before turning her eyes back to the road.</p><p>Rio’s smile drops a little, not in a bad way—just deeper. Steadier. She nods once. “Of course, Agatha. That’s what I was going to ask you too.”</p><p>The words feel heavier now, resting between them. Rio watches her, studies the way her jaw tightens even though she’s not reacting otherwise. </p><p>She reaches over. Lets her hand settle on Agatha’s thigh, warm and sure.</p><p>Agatha flinches just slightly. Not fear—just startled. Like it pulled her straight out of wherever she’d spiraled.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says, quieter now.</p><p>She turns her head, just enough. Enough for Rio to see the worry swimming in her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha says, voice rough around the edges.</p><p>Rio pauses. Half a second. Maybe less. Then, “I need to tell you about work. My work.”</p><p>Agatha nods once, her throat bobbing with a swallow.</p><p>Rio keeps her hand where it is, thumb moving in slow, steady circles. Then she starts.</p><p>“It’s about the call I got earlier today,” she says, watching Agatha’s profile carefully. “It’s from a woman named Kate Bishop. She owns or is part of this high-end event planning company in New York. Real deal. She’s been looking for a florist.”</p><p>No reaction. Just Agatha breathing in that too-even way, staring out at the roadt.</p><p>Rio keeps going.</p><p>“The contract’s…” She huffs a quiet laugh. “It’s ridiculous, Agatha. Financial freedom. Straight up. A monthly retainer that would cover everything. Rent. Groceries. I could stop taking bad clients. Stop doing back-to-back parties every weekend just to keep my business above water.”</p><p>Her fingers pause, just for a second. Then keep going.</p><p>“I could be picky. Finally. Choose the projects I actually care about.”</p><p>Still nothing from Agatha. Just that small nod, the kind people give when they’re listening but don’t know what to do with what they’re hearing. Rio doesn’t take it personally. She wouldn’t know what to do either.</p><p>“I mentioned it at dinner,” she says. “I think you were in the bathroom. Evanora asked me something and—I don’t know, she got under my skin. Like she always does. I blurted it out. I didn’t want to hide it from you, I just hadn’t figured out how to tell you yet.”</p><p>Agatha speaks for the first time in minutes. Quiet. Measured. “Okay. But—not to burst your bubble but Rio, Jen told me about the contract. After dinner.”</p><p>Rio’s head snaps around. “What?”</p><p>“Yeah, she told me after she ran out of the dining room. Just said it sounded like a big deal and you had signed with that company.”</p><p>“No.” Her voice is sharp. Immediate. She shakes her head. “No, I didn’t. That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. I haven’t signed it.”</p><p>Agatha blinks. Still staring at the road, but Rio can tell she’s not really seeing it anymore. “You haven’t…”</p><p>“No,” Rio says again, firmer this time. “It’s sitting in my inbox. I read it. Reread it. Reread it again. But no, I haven’t signed. Not yet.”</p><p>Agatha finally turns her head, and when she speaks, her voice is barely there.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Rio breathes in slowly, watching the road, watching her. She feels the weight of it sitting in her chest, crawling its way up until it reaches her mouth.</p><p>“I know we said it would just end at the end of the wedding,” she starts, voice low. Honest. “And if you asked me a week ago why I wouldn’t have signed, I would’ve thought you were crazy. That I was crazy.”</p><p>She lets out a faint, almost disbelieving laugh. “The deal is so good, Agatha.”</p><p>She sees the way Agatha glances at her again—quick, unsure.</p><p>“But?” she asks.</p><p>And that’s it. That’s the cue.</p><p>Rio turns slightly, enough to really face her, hand still resting on Agatha’s leg, thumb drawing light circles again.</p><p>“But,” she says quietly, “Agatha. I don’t do this.”</p><p>She gestures between them, the space that’s somehow always full even when they’re not touching.</p><p>“I don’t do this. But here I am. With you. Doing it. Whatever this is.”</p><p>Her throat feels tight now, the words fighting through. She continues. She has to. </p><p>“I can’t stop thinking about you. About us. What it could maybe turn into.”</p><p>She watches Agatha from the side, sees her knuckles whiten slightly against the wheel, but she doesn’t say anything yet.</p><p>Rio keeps going.</p><p>“I used to hate Westview. Everything about it. Well—almost everything.”</p><p>That pulls a small twitch of Agatha’s mouth, but it fades fast.</p><p>Rio presses on. “Except Lilia’s—your bookstore. And the garden.”</p><p>That part comes out softer. She swallows, her hand curling a bit against Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“I don’t do feelings. I really don’t do kids or <em>teens</em>. I don’t do any of this.”</p><p>She looks at her now, straight on.</p><p>“And here we are.”</p><p>Another pause. Then—</p><p>“I can’t stay away. And honestly? I don’t want to.” She breathes, steady and open now, no more holding it in. “So I want to talk to you about what this could mean. For us.”</p><p>The words land between them, heavier than anything she’s said all night.</p><p>Rio waits.</p><p>Watches the way Agatha’s jaw moves like she’s chewing through emotion.</p><p>Waits for her to say something—anything. Even no.</p><p>Just… not silence.</p><p>Agatha makes a turn and Rio feels the force of the car pull her away from Agatha a bit. She returns, rubbing circles still on her thighs. </p><p>The silence on the way into the neighborhood feels louder than anything Rio’s ever heard.</p><p>Agatha’s grip is tight on the wheel. Not dangerous—just focused. Like she’s holding something in by force.</p><p>Rio doesn’t say a word. She’s said enough. Maybe too much.</p><p>Nerves prickle at the back of her neck. Maybe she pushed way too far. Past whatever “this” is. </p><p>The car slows, turns, then finally glides into the driveway. Agatha puts it in park, but doesn’t move right away. Just turns toward her, and Rio sees it—those eyes. Shiny. Not crying, not yet. But close.</p><p>“Come on,” Agatha says quietly. “Let’s continue this inside.”</p><p>Rio nods, following her out of the car, the silence still thick between them—but not awkward. Just heavy. Full of everything they’ve both said. Everything they haven’t.</p><p>Inside, it’s dim and quiet. Familiar. They both move toward the couch like they’ve done it a thousand times, like their bodies already know the way.</p><p>They sit—close, but not touching. That space again. Full of things neither of them knows how to say yet.</p><p>Agatha sighs softly as she settles, her shoulder barely a breath away from Rio’s.</p><p>Then she speaks.</p><p>“Rio,” she says, voice low, unsteady, “I don’t—uh—I don’t know what you’re asking from me.”</p><p>Rio blinks. Fair. That’s fair.</p><p>Because technically, she hadn’t really asked anything.</p><p>“I think, uh—” Rio starts, trying to shape the feelings into something solid, something less terrifying. “I think what I’m saying is… I don’t know if I can sign it. Not with whatever we have going.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t react right away, just nods slowly, lips pressing together.</p><p>“Okay,” she says, just that.</p><p>They sit in it. Long enough she can hear Agatha’s breathing in the quiet of the house. Then Agatha turns to her their shoulders brushing, voice quieter now. Honest in a way that sinks deep into Rio’s core.</p><p>“Rio, I’ll be honest. When Jen told me about the contract, I wanted to throw up.”</p><p>Rio swallows a lump in her throat. </p><p>“But you telling me about it? How good it is? How hard you’ve worked for this?”</p><p>Agatha looks at her then—really looks.</p><p>“You need to sign it.”</p><p>And that’s what does it. Not yelling. Not anger. Just that. </p><p>
<em>You need to sign it. </em>
</p><p>Rio feels it—actually feels it. Like her heart is splitting in two. A real crack, deep and sharp and awful.</p><p>She looks away, blinking hard. Swallowing the lump climbing up her throat. Because fuck.</p><p>This feels like loss.</p><p>Loss she hasn’t had since senior year. </p><p>And she’s not even sure they’ve had enough time together to lose anything. But still—she feels it anyway. Because no - </p><p>It’s been enough time. More than enough time. </p><p>It is a loss. </p><p>Rio feels it - like it’s already slipping through her hands.</p><p>Agatha’s voice cuts through the silence.</p><p>“Look,” she says, and it’s already breaking something open in Rio’s chest. “I, uh—I hate the idea that you’re leaving. Whenever that is.”</p><p>Rio swallows, hard.</p><p>“But Rio, this is huge. If you’re telling me right now you can’t sign it because of me—” Agatha shakes her head, eyes shining again. “I can’t be the reason for that. You have to take it.”</p><p>Before Rio can say anything, Agatha reaches for her hand—gripping it tight, like it hurts to let go.</p><p>“I know you’ve been working so hard for so long,” she says. “This would set you up. For a while. I can’t watch you not sign it.”</p><p>Rio nods slowly, the ache in her chest pulsing like a bruise. “It’s a good deal,” she murmurs. “But Agatha—”</p><p>She doesn’t get to finish.</p><p>Agatha presses a finger to her lips.</p><p>Then she’s moving—really moving—climbing into Rio’s lap in a way that immediately lights her skin on fire. Familiar. Exactly like last night. The closeness. The weight. </p><p>Agatha straddles her, one hand still wrapped around Rio’s, the other cupping her cheek like she’s afraid Rio will move from her grip. It forces Rio to look into Agatha’s blues. She feels the prick of tears. </p><p>“You can’t ask me to tell you not to sign it,” Agatha says, voice lower now, trembling at the edges. “Because if you really ask me, I’m going to tell you not to.”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches.</p><p>“I’m going to tell you to move back to Westview. I’m going to tell you to stay. Here. With me.”</p><p>The words hit her like a tidal wave.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes search hers, desperate and open and full of something raw.</p><p>“And I can’t—I cannot—ask you to do that, Rio. Not with this opportunity you have in front of you, waiting for you to just sign.”</p><p>She exhales, and it shakes through both of them.</p><p>“You have to take it, Rio,” she says again, firmer this time. Her thumb brushes Rio’s jaw. “Please don’t ask me.”</p><p>And just like that, the fire in Rio’s chest turns to ash. Her hands find Agatha’s hips without even thinking, holding her like she’s afraid she might vanish.</p><p>Because maybe she will.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” Rio whispers, voice breaking around the words. </p><p>“As you wish.”</p><p>The tears fall freely now. Hot and silent. She fucking hates this. Hates the way her chest aches like it’s folding in on itself. Hates that it should be the right decision. Hates that Agatha’s being good and selfless and still somehow slipping through her fingers.</p><p>But Agatha doesn’t pull away.</p><p>No— Agatha grabs her face with both hands, firm and tender all at once, and leans down to kiss her. It’s slow. Deep. Tender. And Rio—God, Rio wants to die. Or disappear into it. Something. Anything but this - this feeling. </p><p>She kisses back harder, desperate to give something, take something, feel something besides the ache.</p><p>Agatha presses her deeper into the couch, into her hands, into her. It’s like she’s trying to memorize the way they fit together, imprint it somewhere that won’t fade when the week ends.</p><p>And then she pulls back.</p><p>Rio chases her lips on instinct—needy, breathless, already missing her like she’s gone.</p><p>Agatha stays close. Her forehead rests against Rio’s, and she breathes out—shaky, fragile, still holding on.</p><p>Then, quieter: “Okay. Well with Jen’s wedding cancelled…or whatever Jen’s plan is -“ Agatha lets out a quiet laugh, “I’m still not sure yet.” Her voice dips. “…how much time do I have with you?”</p><p>Rio blinks up at her. Her chest squeezes again.</p><p>She doesn’t know. She really doesn’t know. Everything’s uncertain now—this, them, the job, the timing. But -</p><p>“I’ll stay until I was supposed to leave,” she says. “Like… originally planned.”</p><p>Agatha lets out another breath. This one is shakier, but when she exhales, it sounds steadier. More sure. More real.</p><p>“Okay,” she says again, stronger now. “Okay.”</p><p>And then she nods, like she’s made a decision she can live with.</p><p>“Then let’s make the most of our time.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers tighten against her hips, holding her in place, not ready to let go. Not yet.</p><p>“Okay,” she murmurs. “Okay, yeah. Let’s do that.” </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha wakes up to lips brushing her neck, soft and slow.</p><p>Rio’s arms are wrapped around her chest, pulling her in tight. She’s sore from last night—hips, thighs—but in the best way. The kind of sore that makes her smile before she even opens her eyes.</p><p>“Hey, sweetheart,” Rio murmurs against her skin, voice low and lazy.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flutter open, still half-dreaming, lost in Rio’s touch. “Mmm. Good morning,” she says, voice rough with sleep.</p><p>She shifts a little in Rio’s arms, but not far. “Why are you always waking me up, hmm?”</p><p>A soft laugh against her neck. “You’re right. I’m sorry,” Rio says, and she sounds like she’s not sorry at all. “But—” she kisses her again, “—I’m pretty sure I just heard Alice let herself in.”</p><p>Agatha groans, full-body, right into the mattress. And then freezes halfway through it. She twists in Rio’s arms until they’re face to face, Rio already looking down at her with that small, amused smile. Agatha can’t help but smile back, her hands finding Rio’s hips under the covers.</p><p>“Actually—” Agatha starts, pushing a little closer, “—if she’s here, that’s good. Because guess what she told me yesterday?”</p><p>Rio laughs quietly, warm breath brushing over her lips. “What?” she whispers back.</p><p>Agatha leans up, fingers sliding into Rio’s hair, and pulls her down into a kiss—firm, warm, just long enough to make Rio sigh against her mouth. She pulls back before it can turn into anything more.</p><p>Rio tries to follow her down, chasing her lips, but Agatha’s hand holds steady at the back of her neck, just enough pressure to stop her.</p><p>“She told me she was in love with Jen,” Agatha says, like it’s casual. Like she didn’t nearly choke on it yesterday.</p><p>Rio’s whole face shifts. “Wait. What?” She blinks, sits up an inch like it might help her understand. “Is that why she wanted to sabotage the wedding?”</p><p>Before Agatha can respond, her bedroom door creaks open without warning. Rio moves faster than she should for someone who spent the night doing what they did—blanket yanked up over both of them, fast and practiced. </p><p>Agatha can’t even see Alice, just hears her. “Agatha, I need to—oh my god. Gross.”</p><p>Agatha laughs and drops her head back against the pillow. “Seriously? Are you kidding me, Alice? You didn’t even knock?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Alice groans. “I need to talk to you. Get up.” The door slams shut like punctuation.</p><p>Silence again.</p><p>Agatha turns, and of course, Rio’s already looking at her. That same little half-smile playing on her lips. Like she’s somehow both amused and ridiculously enamored, and trying not to show either too much.</p><p>Agatha softens. Smiles back. “Okay, I’m gonna go talk to her,” she says, already pushing the blanket down and shifting to sit up.</p><p>But before she gets all the way out of bed, she trails her fingers up Rio’s chest, slow and deliberate. Teasing.</p><p>“And maybe you could,” her voice drops, “take a shower?”</p><p>Her eyes flick down, then back up. “And then I’ll kick Alice out once she’s said whatever weird thing she needs to tell me. So it can just be us again.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes stay on her. She grins. “As you wish.”</p><p>Agatha leans in, kisses her one more time, quicker this time, but still sweet, and gets out of bed, already dreading whatever nonsense Alice is about to drop on her now.</p><p>Agatha pulls on her robe, tightening it around her as she hears the shower start in the bathroom. Good. Rio’s occupied. She can deal with Alice.</p><p>She walks toward the kitchen, bare feet dragging a little, still half asleep. Alice hops up off the couch like she was waiting for her and follows her into the kitchen without missing a beat.</p><p>Agatha leans against the counter after she hears the coffee pot starting. Alice plops down at the kitchen table, looking way too pleased with herself.</p><p>“Where’s Rio?” she asks, smiling like she already knows.</p><p>Agatha lets out a sigh. “Taking a shower. We can talk.”</p><p>Alice grins even bigger, like this is somehow perfect for her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Alice says, like she’s about to drop a bomb. “Can I ask you a serious question?”</p><p>Agatha immediately wants to say no. She narrows her eyes, rubbing her forehead. “Yes,” she says instead, because apparently she has a death wish this morning.</p><p>Alice leans forward like they’re conspiring. “I’m not really sure how to ask this, so I’m just gonna say it straight up.”</p><p>Agatha just stares at her. She’s not caffeinated enough for this conversation. “Alice. Ask the question.”</p><p>Alice’s grin turns absolutely criminal.</p><p>“Is your pussy okay?” Agatha freezes. Alice keeps going, way too casual about it. “Like, genuinely? Because at this rate, Rio’s going to fuck you to death.”</p><p>Agatha groans, throwing her head back against the cabinets. “Shut up, Alice.”</p><p>Alice bursts into laughter, hands slapping the table, head thrown back. Agatha just stands there, arms crossed, watching her like she’s the dumbest person alive. Which she is. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry! It’s just - good for you, but Jesus, Agatha! Give your cooch a break.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, grabbing a kitchen towel off the counter and flinging it at her. “You’re an asshole.”</p><p>Alice ducks, still giggling. “You love me,” she chirps.</p><p>Agatha turns back to the coffee pot like she’s trying to remember why she ever chose to have friends. “Unfortunately.”</p><p>Alice finally stops laughing, still grinning way too much, and blurts out, “I told Jen.”</p><p>Agatha blinks. Hard.</p><p>Oh, fuck.</p><p>She pushes off the counter and sits down across from Alice at the table, heart picking up a little. “Okay. So you told Jen.”</p><p>Alice nods, fiddling with her hands now like she’s suddenly nervous.</p><p>“I think I’ve got a shot,” she says, voice softer. “It’s gonna be slow at first, but…she’s letting me take her on a date. Soon.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows shoot up. She wasn’t ready for that.</p><p>She leans in a little. “Wait, what? Like an actual date? Like she knows it’s a date?”</p><p>Alice nods again, looking up with this small, kind of scared smile. “Yeah. She knows. She said…she said she’s not ready for anything big, but she doesn’t want to lose me. And she said yes when I asked.”</p><p>Agatha just stares at her for a second. Because what the fuck.</p><p>Not only was Alice secretly in love with Jen — their Jen — but apparently Jen has…feelings too? Enough to say yes to a date?</p><p>“Wow,” Agatha finally says, shaking her head a little. “Alice, that’s amazing. I’m so happy for you.”</p><p>Alice’s face lights up even more, and Agatha has to smile back, because she’s so happy for her.</p><p>“By the way,” Agatha says, giving her a look. “How long have you been in love with Jen? And also, why the fuck didn’t you tell me?”</p><p>Alice groans, flopping back in her chair. “Ugh. Forever. Like…I don’t know. College? Maybe even high school? It’s been a while.”</p><p>Agatha stares harder at her. “And you just never thought to mention that to me?”</p><p>Alice shrugs helplessly. “I thought it would go away! I thought I’d grow out of it! And then she got engaged and it was just…easier not to say anything.”</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms. “You’re an idiot.”</p><p>Alice shrugs again, not even trying to argue. “Yeah, well. I am. But maybe I’m finally a brave idiot.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, fighting a smile. </p><p>Rio steps into the kitchen, freshly showered, barefoot, hair still dripping a little onto her shoulders. She looks good. Too good. Like, Agatha’s brain slows down a second just watching her walk in.</p><p>Alice doesn’t miss a beat. Grins and says loud enough for Rio to hear, “Hey Rio,” </p><p>Rio just shakes her head, smiling as Agatha hands her a cup of coffee, “Thank you sweetheart.” She says quietly. </p><p>“Sweetheart?” Alice whistles low. </p><p>Agatha groans, setting her mug down harder than necessary. “Alice, please.”</p><p>But just as Agatha finishes her sentence, the front door creaks open again. Rio quirks an eyebrow at her, still leaning casually against the counter. “Does everyone in Westview have a key to your house?”</p><p>Agatha laughs, turning just as Jen steps through the kitchen door, slipping in right behind Rio like it’s the most normal thing in the world.</p><p>“Pretty much,” Jen answers for her, tossing her keys onto the little bowl by the door. “Good morning, everyone.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, smiling as she moves to grab another cup and start fixing Jen’s coffee exactly the way she likes it. No one even has to ask anymore. It’s just…automatic.</p><p>This—having them here, like this—it’s familiar. It’s everything.</p><p>Alice teasing, Jen rolling her eyes but sticking around anyway, Rio fitting in like she was always meant to be part of it.</p><p>For a second Agatha just soaks it in.</p><p>Because no matter what happens later, no matter what decisions get made about jobs and cities and all the other real-world bullshit, this moment is hers.</p><p>She hands Jen her coffee, bumps her shoulder gently against Rio’s as she passes, and breathes it all in.</p><p>Yeah. She’s grateful.</p><p>Even if her friends are absolute dicks before nine a.m.</p><p>“Hi, Jen,” Alice says, voice low, almost shy.</p><p>Agatha has actually never seen Alice like this before—so timid, so weirdly soft. It’s almost adorable, now that Alice’s feelings are actually out in the world instead of buried under years of denial and sarcasm.</p><p>Jen smiles back at her, this small, easy thing that makes Alice blush immediately, and Agatha has to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from teasing.</p><p>Jen turns toward the group again, still smiling, and claps her hands once, loud enough to make Alice jump slightly.</p><p>“Okay,” Jen says, like it’s already decided. “I need to borrow Rio here for a few hours.” Agatha immediately frowns, the words hitting her wrong. She doesn’t even try to hide it. They only had a few days left. And she had kind of been hoping today could be… theirs. Jen keeps going, completely oblivious. “Since I’ve officially called off the wedding, Mom wants the roses out of her greenhouse. Like, today.”</p><p>Agatha glances over at Rio, half-hoping she’ll say no, stay, that she’ll fight her way out of it somehow. But Rio’s already nodding, like she’d been expecting it. Like she knew Jen was gonna ask this.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach sinks a little.</p><p>Alice must pick up on it too, because when Agatha flicks her gaze toward her, Alice is watching them closely—brows furrowed, mouth pressed in a line.</p><p>Jen, oblivious as ever, just grabs her coffee and keeps talking.</p><p>“We’ll be back soon,” she promises. “But I can’t have Mom any angrier than she already is. So far I’m still in the will, but who knows if that’ll change by the end of the day.”</p><p>Alice snorts into her coffee.</p><p>Agatha forces a smile, watching Rio drain the last of her cup.</p><p>“Good luck,” Agatha says, voice even. And she means it.</p><p>But it doesn’t stop the ache building behind her ribs.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything at first. Just reaches for Rio’s hand and gives it a tug.</p><p>Alice immediately starts making obnoxious kissy noises from the kitchen like she’s five.</p><p>Agatha groans, not even turning around. “You’re so annoying.”</p><p>But she hears Rio laugh quietly behind her, that low, warm sound, and it makes her smile. She doesn’t stop walking until they’re in the hallway—just far enough from the kitchen for privacy—and then she turns, pushes Rio gently against the wall.</p><p>“Couple hours?” she asks, tilting her head up to meet her gaze.</p><p>Rio’s already smiling a little, not quite guilty, just… soft. “Yeah. Jen texted me about it this morning. Evanora’s on a rampage about everything.”</p><p>Agatha lets her hands slide up Rio’s chest, over the smooth fabric of her shirt, thumbs brushing along the line of her collarbone. “Okay,” she murmurs. “But then you come back. And then it’s just you and me, yeah?”</p><p>That gets her a real smile—bright and full of something that twists in her chest. “As you wish.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes but she’s smiling too as she pulls Rio down into a kiss—slow and full even though she knows they don’t have much time. She pulls back first, laughing quietly against Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“Why are you always saying that?”</p><p>Rio shrugs under her hands, eyes still on her. “Just feels right. Like—whatever you want.”</p><p>Agatha stares up at her for a second, not saying anything. Just letting herself feel it. Then she sighs, dramatic. “Fine. Go deal with roses and the devil reincarnate. But don’t be gone long.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio promises. And it sounds like she means it.</p><p>Agatha heads back to the kitchen with Rio, her fingers brushing lightly against Rio’s hand as they walk. Jen’s already grabbing her keys off the counter.</p><p>“Ready?” she asks, glancing at Rio.</p><p>Rio nods, easy. And then they’re both out the door, leaving Agatha standing there with Alice.</p><p>She turns, already bracing herself, because Alice has that signature smirk—shit-eating grin and all.</p><p>“What, Alice?” Agatha asks, deadpan.</p><p>Alice throws her hands up like she’s innocent. “Nothing! Just haven’t seen you like this. It’s nice.”</p><p>Agatha blinks, caught off guard. She’d been fully expecting a joke. A dirty comment. Something. Not that. She smiles lowly, almost to herself. “Yeah, I don’t uh—I don’t know. She keeps surprising me.”</p><p>Alice’s face softens, a real, sweet look she doesn’t flash often. “That’s a good thing, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha nods back, feeling it settle low and warm in her chest. “Okay,” she says, clearing her throat, “well, do you want to grab breakfast or something while they’re gone?”</p><p>Alice perks up immediately. “Hell yeah.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, already heading toward her bedroom. “Let me shower real quick and you can drive, since you’re the one who interrupted my morning.”</p><p>Alice’s voice follows her down the hall. “Wasn’t my fault you were getting railed when I walked in!”</p><p>Agatha just flips her off over her shoulder without looking back, and hears Alice cackle like it’s the funniest thing she’s ever said.</p><p>——-</p><p>They make it to breakfast in one piece. Somehow. Agatha hates how Alice drives. But nonetheless, they arrive to the only diner in Westview. The one that still had the same cracked red booths and black-and-white checkered floors since Agatha was a kid. Smelled like coffee, syrup, and too much bacon grease.</p><p>Agatha’s bookstore was right across the street. If you sat facing the window, you could see it perfectly—sign swinging gently with the breeze, front door locked up for the morning. But then when she went to sit down facing the window, Alice had made a whole thing about where they sat—insisting Agatha sit facing away from the front window. </p><p>Agatha didn’t think anything of it. </p><p>Alice was just weird.</p><p>Their food hits the table fast—classic diner spread. Agatha’s got pancakes stacked high, crispy bacon on the side. Alice is halfway through her omelet and hash browns. </p><p>They eat for a minute in peace. Then, mouth still half-full, Alice asks, “So really though—what do you think is going to happen with Rio?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head immediately. “I already told you.”</p><p>Alice groans, dramatic. “Yeah, Agatha, but come on—you’re really telling me you guys couldn’t make it work for like, a year?”</p><p>Agatha cuts a piece of pancake and shrugs. “I don’t know—I don’t. She’s going to be busy. I am also very busy in case you haven’t realized.”</p><p>Alice pops a bite of food into her mouth, talking around it. “You should try anyways.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, setting her fork down. “I just—what if it is long distance and it fizzles out like every other long distance thing because we never see each other? Or she finds someone else in New York? Or Wanda makes everything worse with Billy’s custody?”</p><p>Alice doesn’t respond right away. Just reaches across the table and places her hand over Agatha’s, warm and steady.</p><p>“Honey, we’ve talked about your end-of-world thinking.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but Alice keeps going, voice softer.</p><p>“Just… don’t close a door because you’re scared. Don’t walk away because you didn’t try. That’s all I’m saying.”</p><p>Agatha sits with what Alice says for the rest of breakfast. </p><p>—-</p><p>As they step out of the diner, Agatha mentions casually, “I should check on the store. And Lilia. I haven’t seen her in a few days.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes go wide for half a second. Too wide. “Or,” she says quickly, “we could go get ice cream. You know, really just lean into the unhealthy coping mechanisms.”</p><p>Agatha squints at her. “You’re being weird. It’s too early for ice cream.”</p><p>Alice just laughs, way too loud and fake. “Me? Always. That’s not new.” She’s about to say something else when her phone chimes. She looks down at it, her face lighting up for a second, and when she looks back up, she’s already moving.</p><p>“Fine,” Alice says, stepping backward toward the sidewalk. “Go check on your store. I’ll catch up with you later!”</p><p>“Alice! You’re my ride home!” Agatha calls after her.</p><p>Alice just throws a wave over her shoulder and keeps walking away like she didn’t hear a thing.</p><p>Agatha groans, she’ll just take Lilia’s car or something. As she’s shoving her hands into the pockets of her jacket, she crosses the street, ignoring the loud honk of a car that slams on its brakes when she steps off the curb without looking.</p><p>The bookstore looks fine from the outside. Display window is still neat. Sign still hanging straight.</p><p>But when she reaches the front door, she frowns.</p><p>The “CLOSED - Be Back Soon” sign is flipped to the front, and the lights inside are off.</p><p>That’s… not right.</p><p>She checks the time on her phone—10:07 a.m. It should definitely be open. Her store always opened by 9:30, even if no one showed up until closer to noon. </p><p>
<em>Where is Lilia?</em>
</p><p>Heart weirdly racing, she digs her key out of her pocket, sticks it into the lock, and pushes the door open.</p><p>“Lilia?” she calls, flipping on the switch next to the door.</p><p>The lights click on—and she freezes.</p><p>Everything seems fine—until her eyes catch on the explosion of red right in the middle of the shop.</p><p>And right in the middle of it? </p><p>“Rio.”</p>

<p>The hot water was barely starting to steam around her when Rio heard her phone chime on the counter. She shut the water off with a sigh, grabbing a towel and crossing the bathroom with wet feet, dripping everywhere. One text from Jen.</p><p><strong>Jeni 🥬 (The Worst Kind of Vegetable)</strong><br/>
Mom’s making me get rid of the roses. Can you help me with your van?</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her wet hair, frowning at the phone. Damn it. She wanted today with Agatha. Just them. She thumbed out a quick reply.<br/>
 </p><p align="right"><strong>Rio:</strong><br/>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Yeah no problem. Just gotta grab my van the hotel</p><p>Well - Jen already knows, no bothering trying to hide that she was at Agatha’s.</p><p><br/>
<strong>Jeni 🥬 (The Worst Kind of Vegetable):</strong><br/>
No worries I’ll come pick you up. Be there in like ten.</p><p>She tossed the towel around her neck, pulled on a fresh shirt and jeans, and grabbed her phone before heading downstairs.</p><p>The smell of coffee hit her the second she stepped through the hallway. She could hear Agatha moving around in the kitchen. She could hear Alice finishing her sentence, “-- I’m finally a brave idiot.” </p><p>She smiled to herself, having no context behind what Alice was saying, and padded in barefoot.</p><p>“Hey, sweetheart,” Rio said low, grinning when Agatha turned around at the sound of her voice.</p><p>Before she could get more than two steps into the kitchen, the front door cracked open. Rio blinked as Jen strolled in like she owned the place.</p><p>“Does everyone in Westview have a damn key to your house?” Rio asked, raising an eyebrow at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha laughed, not even pretending to be surprised.<br/>
“Pretty much,” Jen answered for her, tossing her keys into the little bowl by the door like she’d lived there her whole life. “Good morning, everyone.”</p><p>Rio stood near the counter, hands wrapped around her mug, trying not to look like she was staring when Agatha moved to make Jen’s coffee. She didn’t ask. Didn’t even hesitate. Just started fixing it exactly the way Jen liked it, like it was second nature now. Like it was just what they did around here.</p><p>It was weirdly comforting, all of it.</p><p>And maybe that’s what hit the hardest.</p><p>Because this wasn’t permanent. It never had been. There was an expiration date looming over everything. But right now? With the smell of coffee and the soft hum of the kitchen and Agatha brushing her shoulder as she passed—</p><p>It felt like everything.</p><p>“Hi, Jen,” Alice said, voice lower than usual. Softer.</p><p>Rio caught it immediately—how different it was. Like Alice was nervous. It was honestly kind of sweet.</p><p>Jen smiled back at her, slow and knowing, and Alice turned bright red.</p><p>Rio bit back a grin and looked down at her coffee.</p><p>Then Jen clapped her hands once, loud, and Alice actually jumped.</p><p>“Okay,” Jen said, already halfway to the door. “I need to borrow Rio here for a few hours.”</p><p>The words landed sharper than expected. Rio felt it before she even looked over, Agatha’s frown.</p><p>They didn’t have much time left. And it was clear she’d been hoping today might just… be theirs.</p><p>Jen, of course, didn’t notice any of it. “Since I’ve officially called off the wedding, Mom wants the roses out of her greenhouse. Like, today.”</p><p>Rio gave Agatha a quick glance—half apology, half explanation—but she was already nodding. Of course she was. She wasn’t about to leave Jen to deal with it alone.</p><p>Even if her chest was tightening a little.</p><p>Even if this wasn’t how she wanted to spend the day either.</p><p>Jen kept talking like nothing was weird. “We’ll be back soon,” she added, totally oblivious. “But I can’t have Mom any angrier than she already is. So far I’m still in the will, but who knows if that’ll last.”</p><p>Alice snorted. Rio managed a quiet laugh.</p><p>She drained the rest of her coffee, still watching Agatha.</p><p>“Good luck,” Agatha said softly, voice even. Her eyes didn’t match it.</p><p>Agatha reached for her hand, fingers curling around hers, pulling her out of the room. </p><p>Alice immediately started making dramatic kissy noises from the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even bother turning around. “You’re so annoying.”</p><p>Rio laughed anyway—because she couldn’t help it. It bubbled out easy and warm.</p><p>As soon as they rounded the corner and were out of sight, Agatha spun, pressing Rio back against the wall with both hands flat on her chest.</p><p>“Couple hours?” Agatha asked, voice soft, almost a whisper.</p><p>Rio tilted her head down, smiling just for her. “Yeah. Jen texted me about it this morning. Evanora’s losing her mind.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands slid up, fingers trailing along her collarbone, lazy and light, making Rio’s skin buzz under the touch.<br/>
“Okay. But then you come back,” Agatha said, pressing her body closer. “And then it’s just you and me. Yeah?”</p><p>Rio’s chest ached at the way she said it. Her smile widened. “As you wish.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her down for a kiss—quick and warm—before pulling back with a quiet laugh.</p><p>“Why are you always saying that?” she asked, smiling up at her.</p><p>Rio shrugged, “Just feels right. Like... whatever you want.” </p><p>And it was true. Agatha could ask her to go chase parked cars and she would. </p><p>“Fine. Go deal with roses and the devil reincarnate. But don’t be gone long.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio promises. She means it. </p><p>They walk back towards the kitchen together, Agatha’s hand brushing hers every other step. </p><p>Jen grabs the keys off the counter, “Ready?” </p><p>Rio nods in return, and she’s walking out the door with Jen. She turns back to look at Agatha once more, offering a small smile as she shuts the door behind her. </p><p>Jen barely gave Rio a chance to close the passenger door before she started in.</p><p>“So?” she said, throwing the car into reverse. “Did you talk to her about the contract?”</p><p>Rio leaned her head back against the seat and sighed. “Yeah.”</p><p>“And?” Jen pushed, pulling out onto the street a little too fast.</p><p>“She told me to sign it.”</p><p>Jen’s screech of disbelief practically rattled the windows. “What?!”</p><p>Rio just shrugged, looking out the window as the town passed by in a blur. “Yeah. She said I couldn’t ask for her opinion because if I did… she’d ask me to stay. And the deal’s too good to turn down.”</p><p>She caught Jen shaking her head out of the corner of her eye, muttering something under her breath about idiots.</p><p>“You’re both stupid,” Jen said louder this time. “Like, genuinely. Brain dead.”</p><p>Rio laughed once, dry and low, but didn’t argue.</p><p>Jen didn’t let up. “So what, are you gonna try long distance or something?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth—then shut it again.… she didn’t know.</p><p>She didn’t know if they could make it work. She didn’t know what Agatha even wanted beyond the next few days. </p><p>During their talk last night, Agatha had said if she stayed in Westview they could try. They never spoke about possible long distance. It wasn’t something Rio was excited about - but the alternative made her stomach flip. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said finally, honestly. Quiet. “I want to, I think. But I don’t know.”</p><p>Jen glanced over at her quickly before turning her eyes back to the road.</p><p>The car fell into silence. She watched the streets of Westview roll by, feeling that ache settle somewhere deep in her chest again.</p><p>—</p><p>By the time Rio pulled the van up to Evanora’s house, she could already hear the shouting.<br/>
Great.</p><p>Jen had dropped her off back at her hotel and told her to meet her here—and now here she was, parking on the street and staring at the scene unfolding on the front lawn.</p><p>Evanora was standing outside, absolutely screaming at Jen. Jen was surprisingly  screaming right back. She hadn’t seen Jen yell back before - fight back. Not like this. </p><p>Rio rubbed her hand over her face. </p><p>Okay. Damage control. </p><p>For the first (and probably only) time in her life, Rio stepped right between Jen and Evanora, holding up her hands.</p><p>"Hey, okay, let's calm down," she said, voice steady even though her heart was racing a little.</p><p>Evanora’s glare snapped straight to her, ice cold.  "Stay out of this, Rio. This has nothing to do with you."</p><p>Rio didn’t flinch, just stood there, her body loose and ready in case Evanora started throwing more than words.</p><p>Behind her, Jen gave a humorless laugh and shook her head. "You know what? Fine. We can talk about how I’m a massive disappointment later. You wanted the flowers gone—we’re moving the flowers." Without waiting for Evanora’s next insult, Jen grabbed Rio by the arm and tugged her toward the side gate of the house, away from the front lawn battlefield.</p><p>"Come on," Jen muttered under her breath. </p><p>The greenhouse was humid and overflowing—rows and rows of roses, a thousand in total, just like Rio had left them yesterday. </p><p>Loading them up was going to be a process. She and Jen started working in silence—well, Rio was silent. Jen was muttering under her breath the entire time, cursing Evanora in increasingly creative ways. It wasn’t until their fourth trip hauling flowers to the van that Jen stopped short, blocking Rio’s path.</p><p>"Rio - wait," Jen said, a little breathless from the work, cheeks flushed.</p><p>"Yeah?" Rio asked, adjusting the crate in her hands.</p><p>Jen hesitated for a second, then looked up at her. "Can I ask you something?"</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Jen's eyes narrowed slightly, like she was trying to find the right words. “You want to keep... whatever you and Agatha are, right? After you leave?"</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, “I think so, yeah.” </p><p>Jen kept going, her voice more serious now. "Agatha’s stubborn. You know that. I know she told you to sign the contract—and maybe you should. Even if you two figure this out. It’s not like New York’s that far."</p><p>She paused, wiping her hands on her jeans.</p><p>"But—" Jen's mouth twisted a little. "Since I, you know, cancelled my wedding and derailed my entire life yesterday—I made Agatha and Alice both do something. Something big. Something that made them happy." Rio stared at her, her heart thudding slow and deep. "I’m making you do it too," Jen said, voice softer. "Tell her, Rio."</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded, slower this time, feeling the weight of it settle into her chest. But she didn’t hesitate. </p><p>"Yeah," she said quietly. "Yeah, okay."</p><p>Jen gave her a nod, looking genuinely happy for her.</p><p>They went back to work - one crate at a time. It was a lot better than doing it by herself, but it didn’t mean it wasn’t tiring. </p><p>"So, what do you want me to do with all these? They're technically yours since Evanora bought them already." Rio asks.<br/>
<br/>
"God, I hate them, Rio," Jen said, dead serious. "I hate roses. Do whatever you want with them."</p><p>Rio laughed at the honesty—loud, sharp, and real.</p><p>They went back to work again. </p><p>Another armful of roses.</p><p>Another trip to the van.</p><p>Another breath of sticky greenhouse air.</p><p>Then Rio wiped the sweat off the back of her neck and cleared her throat. “Do you think I could ask a favor then?"</p><p>Jen paused mid-step, turning toward her. "Yeah, whatever you need."</p><p>Rio smiled a little,. "Can you help me get all of these into Agatha’s bookstore?"</p><p>Jen’s face dropped in pure shock—and then lit up almost instantly into a wide, knowing grin.</p><p>"Yes," Jen said without missing a beat. She shoved Rio’s shoulder lightly. "What's your plan?"</p><p>Rio blinked, feeling the idea in her chest starting to crumble because, honestly, she didn’t really have a full plan. Just a thought. A rough sketch of something she wanted to do for Agatha. And by rough sketch it was simply get roses into store. </p><p>Jen held up a finger like she was reading her mind. "Nope. I got this. Don’t worry."</p><p>Before Rio could even respond, Jen was pulling out her phone, already typing something out.</p><p>"I’m texting Alice to keep her away from the bookstore," Jen said casually. "You’ll text Alice when you’re ready for Agatha to come. Alice will figure out how to get her there."</p><p>Jen’s thumbs moved fast, already onto the next thing. "Either way, we need keys. I’m texting Lilia now. She’s been watching the store for Agatha this week."</p><p>And suddenly—</p><p>Suddenly, Rio felt very, very overwhelmed.</p><p>Not in a bad way. In a way that made her stop mid-step and just stand there for a second.</p><p>Because Jen was just—taking over.<br/>
Helping. No questions. No attitude. Just doing it.<br/>
Because she cared.</p><p>About Agatha.<br/>
About her.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, the lump in her throat thick and stubborn. She ducked her head, pretending to mess with the sleeve of her T-shirt just so she didn’t have to say anything.</p><p>The silence that stretched between them was good though.<br/>
Warm. Solid.<br/>
It let Rio sit with it for a second longer—let her feel it all the way down to her toes.</p><p>—--</p><p>They pulled up behind the bookstore, Rio shifting the van into park as Jen hopped out, already waving. Lilia was waiting by the back door, keys in hand, a wide smile on her face.</p><p>The second Jen reached her, she pulled Lilia into a quick hug.<br/>
<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br/>
"Why am I giving you the store keys right now?" Lilia asked, teasing but curious.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to answer, but Jen beat her to it. "Romeo here," Jen grinned, jerking her thumb toward Rio, "is about to pull off a whole rom-com movie gesture for Agatha."</p><p>Lilia lit up like the sun. "Well, I’ll be," she said warmly. "I always wondered if you two would get together."</p><p>And just like that, she handed over the keys and started walking away down the alley, casual as anything.</p><p>Jen snorted under her breath, unlocking the door with a click, but Rio just stood there, frozen.<br/>
She always wondered?<br/>
Rio stared after Lilia’s retreating figure, her mind racing.<br/>
Since when?<br/>
It’s not like her and Agatha interacted before this week. </p><p>"Hey, lover girl, you coming?" Jen called from the door, already swinging it open.</p><p>Rio shook herself out of it, still in a little bit of a daze, and followed Jen inside, her heart pounding harder than before.</p><p>She stepped inside and they got to work.</p><p>It wasn’t glamorous. Hauling buckets of freshly clipped roses wasn’t exactly what Rio thought she’d be doing this morning - not twice - but there was something grounding about it. The simple repetition of movement. The scent of the flowers, rich and full and a little overwhelming.</p><p>It helped calm her nerves. She could crawl out of her skin right now. </p><p>Jen pulled the van up as close to the back entrance as possible, and together they carried in armful after armful, filling the front space with red.</p><p>“Jesus,” Jen muttered at one point, elbow-deep in roses. “It’s like a Disney movie exploded in here.”</p><p>Rio didn’t argue. Just gave a quiet hum of agreement and kept working.</p><p>She took her time arranging them—long after Jen had stopped trying to “help” and just watched her, leaning against the counter. Rio set each bucket down with care, rotating them slightly, stepping back, then forward again to adjust something by a fraction of an inch.</p><p>The space started to shift around her.</p><p>The cluttered comfort of the bookstore faded into something else—something blooming, romantic, impossible to ignore. A declaration without a single word spoken.</p><p>She was still tweaking the placement of a bunch when Jen stepped beside her and offered the keys.</p><p>“Give these back to Lilia for me?” she asked.</p><p>Rio nodded, taking them. The keys felt warm from Jen’s hand. “Yeah,” she said softly. “Of course. Thanks.”</p><p>Jen didn’t say anything else. Just gave her one last look, a  little knowing, a little fond, and left.</p><p>Just as the door opened, she heard Jen yelling back, “Should I turn off the lights, Romeo?”</p><p>“Yes, please!” Rio responded. </p><p>The lights clicked off and the bell above the door jingled as it closed behind her.</p><p>And then Rio was alone. In a somewhat dark bookstore - light filtering through the display windows. </p><p>Rio was standing in the middle of it all, surrounded by a thousand roses, because Agatha deserved it. The big grand gesture. </p><p>Rio set the keys gently on the counter, then looked around at what she’d done. At what this meant. Her hands were still a little damp from the stems, fingertips scratched faintly from the thorns. But all she could think about was Agatha.</p><p>What her face might look like when she walked in.</p><p>How it might feel if Agatha said yes.</p><p>To this.</p><p>To them.</p><p>To whatever the hell they were becoming. To what they could become. </p><p>Rio took one last breath, deep and slow. Then she leaned back against the counter, sliding her phone out of her pocket and texted Alice. </p><p align="right"><strong>Rio:<br/>
</strong>Ready.</p><p>The reply came fast.’</p><p><strong>Alice aka Gladys Kravitz:</strong><br/>
oh good she’s coming rn. we were at the diner across the street.</p><p>Rio exhaled like she’d been holding her breath for the past hour. Maybe she had. She looked down at her hands. Too sweaty. She wiped them on her jeans and told herself to get it together.</p><p>Then she heard it—the bell over the door.</p><p>The click of the light switch.</p><p>“Lilia?” Agatha’s voice floated in, confused - like she didn’t know why her store’s lights were off and the closed sign was on the door. </p><p>Rio didn’t move. She watched through the gaps between shelves, her heart thudding like it was trying to climb out of her ribs.</p><p>Agatha rounded the corner of a display and stopped dead in her tracks. Her eyes swept the room. And then they landed on Rio.</p><p>There was a beat—just long enough to catch—and Rio swore she could see Agatha’s brain stall out, like she was taking it all in.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed, soft and stunned.</p><p>Rio straightened just enough to nod. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha let out a short laugh, a breathy, disbelieving sound. “What the hell is all of this?” she asked, quiet, just loud enough that Rio could hear it from across the room.</p><p>Rio’s hand found the edge of the counter behind her. “Well, we had to get rid of the roses,” she said, shrugging like it was no big deal. “But I didn’t want to just trash them.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head slowly, but she was moving. Forward. Every step she took toward Rio sent a small shockwave through her chest.</p><p>Because it meant she wasn’t walking away.</p><p>“Why are they in my store, Rio?” she asked, eyes narrowing just slightly, trying to figure her out.</p><p>Rio stayed where she was, back still against the counter.</p><p>She took one more breath, pulled herself steady.</p><p>“I wanted to put them in a place that meant something,” she said, voice lower now. “To both of us.”</p><p>Agatha nodded softly in response, eyes still scanning the roses before going back to Rio, and then repeating their path, back to the roses. </p><p>Rio didn’t look away. She kept going. “We talked about my contract yesterday. But we didn’t talk about us.”</p><p>Agatha let out a light breath, not quite a sigh—more like she’d been holding something too.</p><p>Rio felt the tension in her chest ease, just a bit. Enough to keep going. “So I think we should. Talk about it. Because I don’t think I can not try this with you, Agatha.” Her voice cracked a little at the end, but she didn’t let it stop her.</p><p>“I don’t know what it looks like. Or where it goes. But I do know that in the last few days, every second with you has felt like something I want to keep. And I can’t pretend like I didn’t feel that. Like I’m not still feeling it. Even when I try to talk myself out of it, it’s still there.”</p><p>She stepped away from the counter now, slow and sure, stopping just a few feet from her.</p><p>“I want to keep feeling like this. I want to see what this is. Whatever that means, wherever it goes. As long as you’d have me.”</p><p>She didn’t ask the question. She just left it there—between them, in the middle of a bookstore filled with roses. Waiting for Agatha to decide.</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a second too long. Just long enough for Rio’s chest to tighten again.</p><p>Then—</p><p>“I’m scared,” Agatha admitted softly. “Of the distance. Of what this looks like when you leave. When we’re not… in this bubble.”</p><p>But she didn’t step back. Her hand reached out instead, found Rio’s fingers and laced them together. Her touch was soft. Thumb rubbing slow over the back of her hand like it meant something. Like she was grounding herself there.</p><p>Rio stayed still, let her talk. She wasn’t going to push - just listened.</p><p>“But,” Agatha continued, her voice steadier now, “you’re not the only one who’s been feeling something. I’ve been trying to ignore it. Or minimize it. Tell myself it would fade when you left.” She shook her head. “But I know it won’t. I keep replaying every second since the spa. You made me feel something I haven’t in a long time. And I don’t want to walk away from that.”</p><p>Rio’s heart just about burst in her chest. That was it. That was everything she’d been holding her breath to hear. And hearing it from Agatha—soft and honest—it felt like her whole body finally exhaled.</p><p>The silence stretched for a beat too long, but Rio let it. Let it settle like warmth through her ribs.</p><p>Then she smiled, just a little. “You know the other reason I brought all these roses in?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow lifted, lips curving. “Why?”</p><p>“I told you, I don’t kiss a lot of ladies in front of a thousand roses.” She stepped a little closer, voice low. “But I’d like to do it again.”</p><p>Agatha let out a short laugh, just a breath of amusement, but her eyes never left Rio’s. She leaned in.</p><p>Rio met her halfway.</p><p>Their mouths found each other without any hurry. Agatha’s lips were cool, moving soft and certain against hers. Like she wasn’t going anywhere. She tasted like something sweet, strawberry jam or maybe syrup - something she had at breakfast.</p><p>Agatha pulled back just slightly, just enough to look at her. Her eyes darkened in that way that made Rio’s pulse kick up.</p><p>Then—quiet, a little wicked, “So lover girl, have you ever fucked in front of a thousand roses?”</p>

<p>“So, lover girl,” Agatha murmured, voice syrup-slow and teasing, “have you ever fucked in front of a thousand roses?”</p><p>She didn’t even get the full smile out before she caught the change in Rio’s face, how quickly the warmth in her eyes burned down into something darker, hungrier. It made Agatha’s breath hitch.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything at first. Just started moving towards her - slow, steady, purposeful. Agatha didn’t move. She didn’t even blink.</p><p>And then she was being moved by her hips.</p><p>Her back hit the bookshelf with a dull thud, cool wood biting through her shirt. She gasped- not from pain, but from how fast Rio had her there. How intentional it was. Her head bumped lightly against the shelf when she nodded, already breathless, and then Rio’s voice was right there.</p><p>“Is that what you want, Agatha?”</p><p>She nodded again, slower this time. A little drunk on the heat pooling low in her belly.</p><p>“As you wish,” Rio said.</p><p>Then her mouth was on her, and nothing was soft anymore.</p><p>Hands were everywhere, gripping her hips, sliding under her shirt, palming over her ribs. The kisses weren’t sweet. They were deep and dirty and filthy, the kind of kiss that made Agatha forget where she was. She chased Rio’s mouth like she needed it to breathe, fingers curling in the collar of her shirt just to keep herself upright.</p><p>Rio kissed like she meant every inch of it.</p><p>Her thigh slipped between Agatha’s legs, and Agatha nearly choked on her own moan. She felt Rio’s hand sliding down, gripping tight at her ass, pulling her forward. </p><p>She broke the kiss to gasp against her cheek, breathing hard. “Jesus.”</p><p>Rio grinned, moving down to her neck. “Not quite.”</p><p>Then her hand moved again, this time toward Agatha’s jeans, and Agatha’s breath caught sharp in her throat.</p><p>Her back was still pressed hard to the shelf when she felt Rio’s fingers work at the button of her jeans - slow, like she was unwrapping a gift. Agatha sucked in a breath and buried her face in the crook of Rio’s neck, overwhelmed by the scent of her - warm skin and salt and something just so Rio she thought she might lose her mind over it.</p><p>She kissed the skin there, tasted sweat and something sweet beneath it. She licked a line up the side of her throat, then another, her lips brushing everywhere she could reach. She was dizzy. Desperate. She wanted to climb inside her.</p><p>And then Rio’s hand was slipping down, into her jeans, over her underwear and when she finally made contact, Agatha gasped, sharp and raw, knees going weak. The pressure was soft. Too soft.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered, biting at Rio’s jaw. </p><p>Rio smiled against her skin, infuriatingly calm. Her fingers moved in slow, teasing circles and Agatha swore she saw stars behind her eyes. She rocked against Rio’s hand, trying to chase it. She didn’t want tenderness. She wanted release. She wanted to come hard and fast and then take Rio home and ruin her properly. Over and over again.</p><p>But then Rio’s mouth was at her ear, lips brushing the shell of it as she spoke, voice maddeningly even.</p><p>“…and we could go to dinner.”</p><p>Agatha’s whole body twitched. “What?” she managed, moaning straight through the question.</p><p>Rio stilled her hand.</p><p>“I said,” she murmured, dragging the words out like honey, “let me take you on a real date.”</p><p>And then her fingers started again - slower than before. Intentionally slow. Agatha whimpered, hips bucking forward. </p><p>“Wine, dinner, the whole thing,” Rio said, each word punctuated by another maddening pass of her fingers. “Ask you those first date questions. Make it official.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t even answer. She was too close, too far gone, twitching under the soft rhythm, every nerve in her body lighting up from the inside out. </p><p>She pressed her forehead to Rio’s jaw -  “Rio,” she growled. “Fuck me.”</p><p>She heard Rio’s laugh, low and pleased, and then her fingers sped up. Finally. Finally. Agatha’s head hit the bookshelf again with a dull thud. She didn’t care. Not when it felt like this.</p><p>Rio’s voice stayed maddeningly steady. “Maybe a three-course meal… a walk in the garden…”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hear the rest. Didn’t register anything beyond the way her body arched into the pressure, her jeans barely clinging to her hips now. She was close. Close enough that her whole body was buzzing, like something in her was short circuiting under Rio’s hand.</p><p>And then - </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, so close she could feel the words against her skin, the warmth of her breath brushing her cheek. “I really, really like you.”</p><p>That’s what did it. Not the friction. Not the buildup. That. That soft confession that meant everything.</p><p>Agatha shattered.</p><p>She moaned loud, unable to stop it, her body jerking forward into Rio’s hand, legs shaking. Her fingers clawed at Rio’s shirt, pulling her closer, as the waves tore through her - hot and aching.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop - just slowed, easing her through it, like she wanted to draw it out. </p><p>When Agatha could breathe again, they were pressed chest to chest, both of them holding on like they’d fall if they let go. Rio’s hand slipped out of her jeans slow and careful, but before she could say a word, Agatha grabbed her face and kissed her.</p><p>Not rushed. Not filthy. Just real.</p><p>“I really, really like you too,” she whispered against Rio’s lips, and felt her melt against her. </p><p>The kiss shifted again, hotter this time. More urgent. Rio groaned against her, hips pressing into her thighs, but then she pulled back just enough to smile.</p><p>“So… what about the date idea?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, soft and dizzy, fingers trailing up Rio’s chest, palm flattening and rubbing slow at her collarbone.</p><p>“Why don’t you,” she murmured, leaning in, “take me home…”</p><p>Another kiss.</p><p>“…and you can ask me all the first date questions you want - ”</p><p>She kissed her again, deeper now, lips parting like she already wanted more.</p><p>“In bed,” she finished.</p><p>Rio laughed against her mouth. “As you wish.”</p><p> </p><p>——</p><p> </p><p>By the time they got to the house, Agatha couldn’t wait anymore.</p><p>The second the door closed behind them, she turned and pressed Rio back into it, kissing her like she needed it to breathe. She heard Rio gasp against her mouth, felt the hitch in her chest when Agatha deepened it - hands in her hair, pressing her closer, like she couldn’t get enough.</p><p>Then Rio was reaching for her shirt, tugging it up with rough hands, but Agatha pulled back just enough to murmur, breathless, “Let’s get to the bedroom first.”</p><p>Rio stilled, then nodded, pupils still blown wide. “Right,” she said, then smirked - and before Agatha could blink, she was being lifted clean off the floor.</p><p>“Rio!” she squeaked, legs wrapping instinctively around her waist, arms clinging to her shoulders.</p><p>Rio just grinned up at her. “Don’t trust me to know the way?”</p><p>“I barely trust you to keep me upright,” Agatha muttered, but she was laughing, dizzy with it, head dropping to Rio’s shoulder as she was carried down the hall.</p><p>They were halfway down the hall when Agatha said, “You’re lucky you’re cute no one picks me up.”</p><p>Rio stopped, pressing Agatha to the wall again just to kiss her - slower this time, but deep. Her hands slipped under Agatha’s thighs, keeping her steady, and then she was kissing down her neck, open-mouthed and tongue.</p><p>Agatha tipped her head back, giving her more, and Rio didn’t waste the invitation. She sucked a mark just below her jaw, then another - low and deliberate - near her collarbone.</p><p>“Are you marking me?” Agatha whispered, breath catching as Rio’s tongue traced where she’d just sucked.</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio muttered into her skin, and then she was walking again.</p><p>By the time they reached the bedroom, Agatha could still feel every place Rio had kissed her - burning and tender, claimed in a way that made her knees unsteady. If she hadn’t been holding onto Rio’s shirt, she might’ve slipped.</p><p>“Bed?” Rio asked, voice rough, husky against her ear.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer with words. She curled her fingers tighter in the fabric at Rio’s chest, walked her backward until the backs of her knees hit the mattress and then gave her a firm push. </p><p>Rio let herself fall, laughing just a little as she landed on her back, propped up on her elbows. Still fully clothed, flushed and breathless, hair mussed from Agatha’s hands. Her eyes found her like a magnet.</p><p>Agatha stood at the edge of the bed for a second, watching her. Yeah. She wanted to ruin her a little.</p><p>She climbed onto the bed slowly, straddling Rio’s lap, her hands dragging up under her shirt. “Lift,” she murmured.</p><p>Rio obeyed without hesitation, arms up. Agatha pulled the shirt off over her head and tossed it aside, then leaned in to kiss her, slow and deep, their mouths moving in sync until Rio’s hands wandered to Agatha’s hips, slipping beneath her shirt.</p><p>They undressed each other with quiet urgency. Jeans unbuttoned. Shirts tugged away. Every touch deliberate. When they were finally skin to skin, Agatha sat there, straddling her, drinking her in.</p><p>Rio’s hands slid up her thighs, warm and steady. Her eyes roamed Agatha’s body like it was she was admiring. “You’re so beautiful, Agatha. I’m so happy we’re trying this,” she said, barely above a whisper.</p><p>And just like that, Agatha remembered.</p><p>Rio asked for a first date. With questions Rio wanted to ask her. </p><p>And Agatha had told her they could do that in bed. </p><p>Which would appear they are in - right now. </p><p>Perfect. </p><p>Rio noticed the shift instantly. “What?” she asked, hands stilled on her hips.</p><p>Agatha leaned down, kissed the corner of her mouth, then whispered, “You wanted to ask first date questions.”</p><p>Rio furrowed her brows, already suspicious. “…Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha smiled sweetly, slid off her and shuffled to the dresser, ignoring Rio’s whine behind her.</p><p>“Agatha,” she warned.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond. She opened the drawer, found what she was looking for, and turned around slowly, letting the strap hang from her hand as she walked back.</p><p>Rio’s eyes went wide. “Oh,” she breathed.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “That a yes?”</p><p>Rio nodded so fast it almost made Agatha laugh.</p><p>She held back. Instead - </p><p>“Good,” she murmured, then crawled back onto the bed, straddling her again, kissing her as soon as she could reach her lips. They were breathless when they finally pulled apart, and Agatha guided the strap over Rio’s hips, helping her settle into it.</p><p>But when Rio went to sit up, Agatha pushed gently on her shoulders. “Down,” she said, soft but firm.</p><p>Rio dropped back immediately, staring up at her like she was in charge.</p><p>And then Agatha smirked. “Ask me your first date questions.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Wait, now?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, dragging her nails lightly down Rio’s stomach, making her twitch. “Isn’t that what you wanted?”</p><p>“Well yes,” Rio said, trying to breathe normally. “To get to know you better but - ”</p><p>“Great,” Agatha interrupted, mouth brushing her chest. “Let’s start with yes or no questions.”</p><p>Rio looked dazed, breathless and Agatha’s barely touched her. “Why?”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>She just kissed a path down her body, slow and deliberate, and settled between Rio’s thighs, the smirk still curling at her lips as she looked up at her.</p><p>Rio was already squirming, hands gripping the sheets.</p><p>“Go ahead,” Agatha said, voice low. “Ask.”</p><p>Agatha licked a slow trail up Rio’s thigh, mouth hot, hands firm. She didn’t rush. Didn’t need to. She let her tongue trace over the harness next, slow and sinful, until she got to the toy itself.</p><p>She let her hand wrap around it, fingers curling just enough to apply pressure because she remembered her strap has the ridge on the other side. How Rio would feel every damn bit of this. She gripped tight, pressing firmly down for just for a second.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Rio gasped.</p><p>Agatha smiled against the silicone, smug and sure. </p><p>Good.</p><p>She glanced up through her lashes, eyes locking on Rio’s flushed face. “Ask me your questions, baby,” she said, voice soft but dangerous.</p><p>And then she turned, lips parting around the tip, tongue circling slow before she took it in.</p><p>Rio’s moan was loud. Immediate. Agatha wasn’t sure if it was the sight of her mouth or the way she was gripping and pressing on her, but either way, Agatha was winning.</p><p>She bobbed her head, slow and steady, hands pumping in rhythm, just a little more pressure each time.</p><p>Rio’s voice was wrecked when she finally remembered to ask, “F-favorite color?”</p><p>“Yes or no questions only,” Agatha reminded, lips brushing the head of the toy, voice sweet, eyes sharp.</p><p>Rio nodded. “Oh right - okay,” she breathed. “Do you like chocolate?”</p><p>Agatha gave a slight nod, lips still wrapped around the toy, not breaking eye contact. Then she pushed deeper, feeling Rio’s hips twitch beneath her, chest rising like she couldn’t get air.</p><p>She hollowed her cheeks and moved faster, pulling a low groan out of Rio before she finally eased off with a wet pop, hand still stroking slow.</p><p>Rio whimpered.</p><p>“Do you like cooking?”</p><p>A shake of her head. Agatha kissed her thigh this time, just below the strap, then turned and wrapped her mouth around the toy again, deeper. She let her tongue curl around it. </p><p>“Do you - fuck. Do you sleep naked?”</p><p>Agatha gave the smallest nod she could manage with her mouth full. And then she pushed further, until her nose brushed the base. She gagged slightly and pulled back with spit slicking her chin. Smirked through it.</p><p>Rio’s hips lifted off the bed on instinct.</p><p>“Do you think about me when you’re alone?”</p><p>That made Agatha pause, just a second. Just long enough to meet Rio’s eyes, let her see the answer before she even gave it.</p><p>Then she nodded.</p><p>And this time she let her mouth take more. More pressure. Deeper. Her throat burned but she didn’t care. Loved the way Rio’s hips jerked. Loved the soft fuck that spilled from her lips.</p><p>“Are you -“ Rio’s voice cracked. She tried again, “Are you happy we’re trying this?”</p><p>That one Agatha felt it. Right in her chest. She didn’t stop. Didn’t break the rhythm. Just looked up at her through watery eyes and moaned around the toy.</p><p>Nodded.</p><p>That was all it took.</p><p>Rio’s hips snapped up, hard. Agatha choked and swallowed, hands flying to grip Rio’s thighs as she tried to steady herself. But Rio kept thrusting up into her mouth like she was chasing it, back arching, muscles tight, head thrown back against the pillow. </p><p>She looked so fucking good like this.</p><p>Agatha didn’t stop until she had to. Until Rio collapsed fully into the bed, breath ragged, sweat shining on her chest.</p><p>Then she let the toy slide from her mouth with a wet pop, wiped her chin with the back of her hand, and crawled up Rio’s body, lips hovering just over hers.</p><p>“I’m so happy we’re trying this,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>She watched Rio’s lips curl into a large smile. And then Rio pulled her down into a kiss, hands roaming her sides like she couldn’t decide where to touch first. Agatha smiled against her mouth, a little smug, a little breathless. She stayed straddling her, chest to chest, kissing deep and slow.</p><p>Then she shifted, sitting up, adjusting her knees on either side of Rio’s hips until the strap pressed exactly where she wanted it, right against her, the perfect pressure.</p><p>She rolled her hips once.</p><p>Rio twitched under her with a sharp inhale.</p><p>Agatha smirked and did it again, slower this time. She could feel the slick wetness already between her thighs, the heat, the anticipation making her pulse throb. And Rio was trembling, breath stuttering out as she tried to keep her hands gentle. But Agatha could feel the restraint in her fingertips.</p><p>“Mm,” she hummed. “You feel that?”</p><p>Rio only nodded, dazed.</p><p>Agatha reached down, guiding the toy with steady fingers until it aligned with her entrance. She held it there, made them both wait a beat longer. Then she started to sink down, slow. </p><p>She moaned soft and deep, as the stretch filled her.</p><p>Halfway in, she paused, rolling her hips just to tease them both.</p><p>By the time their hips were nearly flushed, Rio’s hands were twitching against her thighs, nails digging in just slightly. Her breathing was shallow. Agatha didn’t warn her, just snapped her hips down and took the rest all at once.</p><p>Rio arched under her with a strangled cry.</p><p>Agatha’s own moan tangled in her throat, and she stayed like that for a second, chest heaving, letting them both breathe.</p><p>Then she leaned forward and kissed Rio again - soft, slow, grounding, just lips and breath and quiet between them.</p><p>When she started grinding her hips, slow, deep circles, Rio moaned into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha pulled back, lips brushing over hers. “Ask your questions, Rio.”</p><p>She didn’t wait for a response, just started moving faster. Lifting her hips and sliding down again, only a few inches at a time, just enough to build the rhythm and keep the pressure exactly where she needed it.</p><p>Rio moaned again, deeper this time. “Fuck, Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha just smiled. “That wasn’t a question, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio tries to focus, Agatha can see her trying. Her pupils are blown, lips parted, chest rising in shaky little breaths. But she still swallows and manages, “What’s…your favorite color?”</p><p>Agatha rolls her hips, slow but deeper this time. “Purple,” she breathes.</p><p>Rio groans.</p><p>Agatha leans in and kisses her, brief and biting. “Next.”</p><p>“What…fuck - what’s your favorite book?”</p><p>Agatha shifts, riding her harder. “The Darkhold.”</p><p>Rio’s hands tighten on her hips.</p><p>“Don’t stop now,” Agatha whispers, eyes dark. “You wanted to ask. So ask.”</p><p>Rio breathes in hard. “Favorite flower?”</p><p>Agatha’s pace picks up slightly. “Roses.” She moans. “It’s a recent development.”</p><p>She hears Rio moan at that. And then Rio’s hands slide higher, over her sides, up her ribs, fingers brushing the swell of her breasts. Agatha lets it happen, for a second. Then she catches Rio’s wrists and presses them back to the bed.</p><p>“Stay,” she says quietly.</p><p>Rio nods fast, eyes wide.</p><p>Agatha shifts her body back, hands bracing behind her - one on Rio’s shin, the other flat on the mattress - and moves her knees forward slightly. She starts rolling her hips again, slower now, just enough to feel the stretch and drag of the toy inside her.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio says. Voice wrecked. “Oh fuck.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t have to look to know what she sees, her body splayed, strap sliding in and out of her with every grind of her hips.</p><p>Rio’s not even blinking. Her hands clench against the sheets, her chest heaves, but she keeps them down.</p><p>And then Agatha moves just a little harder, just right, and Rio bucks up sharply. The sudden thrust makes Agatha’s head fall back with a gasp.</p><p>“Fuck,” she cries out, bracing harder on Rio’s shin to steady herself. Her thighs shake.</p><p>And Rio’s gone now, her voice ragged and low, almost growling. “Do you like my strap deep inside you?”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip, tries to ride it out, but Rio stops moving - completely.</p><p>She looks down, panting. “Yes! Yes, I love your strap, fuck.” </p><p>And Rio thrusts up into her, hard. The toy slams deep and Agatha nearly collapses back on her arms.</p><p>“Do you like when I fill you like this?” Rio asks, hips grinding up, slower now, deeper. </p><p>Agatha’s answering with her body - her moans, the way she can’t keep still, how she’s starting to ride harder again, meeting each of Rio’s thrusts.</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio’s voice is rough, strained. “Do you want to come for me, baby?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha gasps. “Yes - don’t stop.”</p><p>Agatha’s riding harder now, both of them chasing it - she can feel it building, low and hot and steady, like something about to snap. Her thighs are trembling with effort, her breaths coming in gasps.</p><p>Rio’s eyes are locked between them, jaw slack, hands still braced at her sides like she’s hanging on for dear life.</p><p>“I love watching your pussy, baby,” Rio says, voice gone hoarse.</p><p>Agatha lets out a broken moan, head falling back. Her hips grind down harder, chasing friction, chasing pressure, chasing anything that’ll tip her over.</p><p>One hand moves, Agatha barely registers it, too lost in the rhythm, but then fingers slide up between her thighs and land right at her clit. Just a press, not even a stroke, but it’s all she needs.</p><p>Agatha’s back arches, her whole body tensing.</p><p>“Oh fuck, Rio - fuck, I’m coming.” Her voice shatters. “You’re so fucking deep - don’t stop, don’t stop - ”</p><p>Rio’s hand doesn’t move. Her thrusts up though, those get rough, desperate, like she’s lost all control. She fucks up into her harder and faster, like she can’t stand not chasing it too.</p><p>And Agatha just falls apart, hips grinding down as her orgasm tears through her - loud, unfiltered, filthy moans spilling out of her.</p><p>Rio’s panting underneath her now, hips still bucking into hers. “Fuck, Agatha -fuck,” she groans.</p><p>And then Agatha feels it, the way Rio jerks beneath her, her muscles locking up as she follows her over. Her thrusts stutter, lose rhythm entirely, but she doesn’t stop moving until the last wave crashes through her.</p><p>They’re both trembling now, still pressed together.</p><p>Agatha starts to fall back, muscles softening, ready to collapse, but Rio moves. She bends up at the waist, arms wrapping tight around Agatha and pulling her down, guiding her to twist just enough so Agatha can rest against her chest.</p><p>Still connected. Still inside her.</p><p>Their breathing is loud, uneven. The room is filled with it.</p><p>Agatha lets her hand drift over Rio’s chest, drawing lazy, aimless patterns across her skin. She’s not ready to move. Not ready to let it go. </p><p>Rio’s hand rubs slow circles into her back. Her chin rests against the top of Agatha’s head, and for a long, quiet moment, neither of them says anything.</p><p>It’s quiet. Safe. Sweet.</p><p>Agatha lifts her head just slightly and presses a kiss right over Rio’s heart. Then another, a little higher. And another at the hollow of her throat. Rio hums at the attention, tilting her head so Agatha can reach more.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asks after a while, voice soft, words nearly lost in her hair.</p><p>“Mmm. Very,” Agatha says, brushing a kiss over her collarbone. “You?”</p><p>“I don’t think I can feel my legs. So yeah. Pretty okay.”</p><p>Agatha smiles, nuzzling into her skin. They both chuckle softly. Like they’re the only ones in the world</p><p>A beat passes. Then another.</p><p>Agatha shifts slightly, lifting her chin just enough to meet Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“So,” she murmurs. “Favorite color?”</p><p>Rio blinks. “Huh?”</p><p>Agatha grins, lazy and smug. “You asked me that. So I’m asking back.”</p><p>Rio squints up at her like she’s trying to reboot her brain. “Wait. You remember what I asked you?”</p><p>“Of course I do,” Agatha says, dragging her nails lightly down Rio’s ribs just to make her twitch. “Isn’t this our first date? I’m supposed to ask you back.”</p><p>Rio stares at her for a second, stunned and then she laughs, low and breathless. “Damn. I didn’t fuck you good enough if you remember what I asked you.”</p><p>Agatha’s whole body lights up at that. She bites her lip, teeth digging in to suppress the grin trying to take over.</p><p>Oh, perfect.</p><p>She shifts just a little in Rio’s lap, feeling the strap still nestled inside her, and lets out a low, satisfied hum.</p><p>“Hmm. Maybe you didn’t,” she teases, voice just on the edge of sweet and wicked. “Good thing we’re home. I’m sure you’ll get another chance.”</p><p>Rio groans dramatically, hands already moving again, dragging over her hips, gripping just a little tighter.</p><p>“Agatha,” she warns.</p><p>Agatha kisses her again.</p><p>“I really like you, Rio,” she whispers. </p><p>Rio’s breath hitches. Smiles  </p><p>“I really like you, too.”</p><p>They don’t rush this time. Just sweet touches and slow kisses. </p><p>———</p><p>Agatha lay across the messy bed, every limb heavy and content. Her body still hummed faintly, skin cooling now. The room smelled like them. Like sweat and sex and lavender from the candle Rio had lit somewhere between rounds three to five. </p><p>Rio had gone to the restroom leaving Agatha with her thoughts. </p><p>She can’t help but think of the things she needs to do. </p><p>The sheets were definitely done for. She’d need to wash them maybe tonight, maybe in the morning. Probably tonight. The comforter too, maybe. Or at least aired out. And the towels from earlier. There were still dishes in the sink. She hadn’t vacuumed in -God, how long?</p><p>Her brain was ticking through it all, cataloging each thing like a to-do list, when she felt it. Soft fingers brushing lightly at her temple, sweeping a bit of hair back from her face.</p><p>She startled, just barely. She hadn’t even heard Rio come back.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said softly, like she didn’t want to startle her again.</p><p>Agatha turned her head and blinked up at her, eyes still glassy with that half-fog of post bliss. “Hey yourself.”</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked, crouching slightly beside the bed now, watching her with that stupidly gentle expression that made Agatha’s chest ache in the best way.</p><p>Agatha nodded, smiling softly. “Yeah. Just… thinking.”</p><p>Rio didn’t push, just gave her one more stroke through the hair. “Well,” she said, her tone light and teasing, “I’m starving. Are you hungry?”</p><p>Agatha let out a small, surprised laugh - like the question had dragged her back to reality. “Yes. Very.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio grinned. “Let’s get you in the shower, and then I’m taking you to dinner.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at her, letting her lead her to the bathroom. </p><p>She took her time in the shower, water hotter than usual, soaking into her muscles. She tried to coax Rio in with her, standing at the edge of the glass, water trailing down her collarbones. But Rio just laughed and leaned against the doorframe.</p><p>“Last time, you said you couldn’t afford the water bill. Nice try.”</p><p>“Still true,” Agatha muttered, but Rio was already turning, her laugh echoing down the hall.</p><p>When Agatha finally stepped back into the bedroom, toweling off her hair, she stopped short.</p><p>The bed had been stripped.</p><p>The messy, tangled sheets - gone. The comforter pulled off, the pillows stacked neatly on the chair.</p><p>She blinked once, then looked toward the small laundry nook at the end of the hallway. She could hear the low rumble of the washer running.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio had just done it. Washed her bedding for her. </p><p>Agatha stood there a moment, holding her towel tight around her chest, overwhelmed in the quietest way.</p><p>Rio hadn’t asked.</p><p>She just… knew.</p><p>Just took care of it.</p><p>Agatha blinked hard. Then smiled to herself. She went to find Rio.</p><p>She found her in the kitchen - Rio had thrown on that dark green sweatshirt from earlier - the one Agatha liked, soft and a little loose in the shoulders. And very obviously on the phone. </p><p>She didn’t mean to eavesdrop.</p><p>But Rio was on the phone, her back turned, pacing slightly. Her voice was low but distinct, and Agatha heard the words before she had a chance to make her presence known.</p><p>“…do you think we can discuss this more in depth?”</p><p>Agatha stilled near the doorway.</p><p>“Yeah, I just want to make sure there’s some schedule we can set up so I’ll have certain days off - of course unless there’s an event or something. But like Mondays and Tuesdays or something, doesn’t have to be specific, whatever works for you.”</p><p>And then Rio turned mid-step and spotted her.</p><p>Her eyes softened immediately, and she smiled. Mouthed a small, apologetic sorry.  And then Rio was nodding again. “Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you, Kate.”</p><p>Kate.</p><p>The contract. </p><p>New York.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>She hadn’t forgotten about it, not really, but she’d tucked it somewhere quieter. Easier. But now it was back and loud again. </p><p>Still leaving.</p><p>Except. </p><p>There is a them now. Their relationship. </p><p>Whatever they’re calling it .  </p><p>So Agatha refuses to let this steal tonight from her.</p><p>So the moment Rio hung up, Agatha moved. She crossed the kitchen in two steps, caught Rio by the front of her sweatshirt, and yanked her down into a kiss so hard they nearly knocked over the corner of the kitchen table.</p><p>Rio gasped against her mouth but didn’t hesitate. Her hands found Agatha’s hips, grounding her, tugging her closer. They kissed like they were still in bed. </p><p>When they finally came up for air, Rio looked dazed - eyes fluttering open, cheeks flushed, breath unsteady. Her lips were kiss swollen, and her voice was hoarse when she asked, “What was that for?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, still holding her by the front of her sweatshirt. “Because of the sheets,” she murmured. “And for being amazing. And kind. And so, so sweet.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her like she wasn’t used to being seen quite that clearly. And then she blushed.</p><p>A real, honest-to-God blush, blooming up from the collar of her sweatshirt to the tops of her cheekbones.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t gotten that from her before. </p><p>She had seen Rio flustered, sure, seen her messy and undone and needy. But this? This quiet sweetness?</p><p>It was something else entirely.</p><p>Agatha leaned in again, softer this time, and kissed her cheek. Then her jaw. Then the corner of her mouth. And Rio stood there, still holding her close, letting herself be kissed like she was trying to memorize it.</p><p>“Let me go take a shower, then we can go,” Rio said softly, brushing her thumb over Agatha’s knuckles before starting to turn away.</p><p>And Agatha - Agatha felt it like a hook in her chest. Clingy.</p><p>Not in an irrational way. Not in a don’t leave me forever kind of way. Just… something in her curled forward, reaching before her mind even caught up. So when Rio gently tugged her hand, like a casual invitation, Agatha followed. Without thinking, without hesitating. Barefoot and still wrapped in a towel, she grabbed her phone off the nightstand as they passed, letting Rio lead her straight into the bathroom.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything, just plucked a clean towel from the stack, laid it carefully over the toilet seat, and leaned down to kiss Agatha’s forehead like it was second nature.</p><p>Agatha sat with a small sigh, and for once, didn’t overthink the silence.</p><p>Rio hummed softly as she showered.</p><p>Not a song Agatha recognized - just a gentle, rhythmic sound under the water. A quiet kind of happiness. Peaceful. </p><p>Agatha’s heart squeezed at the sound.</p><p>She blinked and looked down at her phone.</p><p>Forty texts. Forty.</p><p>From her group chat with Alice and Jen. Two from Lilia. One from Billy. </p><p>She scrolled to Billy’s first.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Billy</strong>: </p><p>hey! just letting you know i’m spending the day with eddie. we’re going to the park and then we might do a movie! love you.</p><p>Agatha smiled. She texted him back.</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha</strong>: </p><p align="right">Sounds perfect. Have the best day, honey. I love you.</p><p>Next was Lilia.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lilia</strong>: </p><p>what the fuck am i supposed to do with all these flowers???</p><p>Attached was a photo of the shop counter absolutely drowning in roses.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a quiet, breathy laugh.</p><p><strong>Lilia</strong>: </p><p>i’m letting customers take them because i’m not cleaning this shit up!</p><p> </p><p>Agatha typed quickly.</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha</strong>: </p><p align="right">Sounds great, thank you. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia hearted the message almost instantly.</p><p>Then she opened the group thread.</p><p>Jen and Alice were, predictably, a nightmare.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong>: </p><p>how’s the sex haze treating you??</p><p><strong>Jen</strong>: </p><p>she hasn’t texted us in 6 hours. she’s either dead or deeply satisfied.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong>: </p><p>i hope deeply satisfied.</p><p><strong>Jen</strong>: </p><p>i vote both.</p><p> </p><p>Then, after a little back and forth about plans for the week - </p><p>A random kiss emoji. From Jen. To Alice.</p><p>Agatha grinned to herself. Shook her head.</p><p>She was happy for them. </p><p>She was pulled from her thoughts as Rio stepped out of the shower with a towel over her shoulders, hair dark and dripping as she rubbed it dry. Her eyes found Agatha’s immediately. She smiled, soft and warm, and leaned down to kiss her.</p><p>It lingered. Gentle but sure.</p><p>Rio’s lips didn’t rush. Her hand grazed Agatha’s cheek on the way back up.</p><p>“Come on, sweetheart,” she murmured, voice still low with affection. “I’m starving.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and stood up to follow her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The restaurant’s fancy. The kind with linen napkins and heavy crystal glasses that catch the light just right. It’s probably the nicest place in Westview. Too nice, if you asked Rio a week ago. Places like this always felt like they came with rules she never got the memo on. How to sit, when to order, what fork to use. But tonight, she doesn’t care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d sit through a twelve-course tasting menu with ingredients she couldn’t pronounce if it meant sitting across from Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t just sit across from her. She owns her space. One arm resting lightly on the table, posture perfect without trying. Her neckline’s sharp enough to hurt someone, lipstick still fresh even after everything they did before getting here. Hair tucked behind one ear and her fingers are wrapped around the stem of her wine glass, not even drinking, just letting the condensation slip slowly down the bowl. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts slightly in her seat, trying not to let it show. The memory of Agatha in her bed hours ago keeps flashing across the table in little snapshots. Warm skin. Scratched nails. That sound she makes when Rio—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their drinks arrive. The silence stretches, but it isn’t awkward. Just full. Heavy in a way that makes the air feel warmer. Comfortable, maybe. Or dangerous. It’s hard to tell the difference sometimes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifts her glass and takes a sip. She lets the bourbon sit on her tongue before swallowing it down. Lets it burn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilts her head, her earrings catching the light. “So…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hums, still drinking. She doesn’t look away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t wait. “Do you normally sleep with girls at least seven times before taking them on a date?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chokes. No warning. No time to recover. She coughs hard and has to set her glass down before she fumbles it right into her lap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Across the table, Agatha grins. It’s wicked, immediate and pleased. And then her heel finds Rio’s calf under the table and drags slowly upward, like she knows exactly how to end her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just joking, baby,” she says, voice smooth and syrupy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swears she can feel heat creep up her neck. She clears her throat and forces herself to sit still, not to react to the foot still tracing her leg. “You’re dangerous,” she mutters. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m delightful,” Agatha counters without missing a beat. She finally picks up her glass, takes a long sip, then sets it back down like she’s settling in. “But I am going to ask you the first date questions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> Rio arches a brow. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods once, calm and confident, like she’s in no rush. “Starting with, tell me about New York.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifts her glass again, covers the curve of a smile with the rim. “That’s not a question.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans forward just enough to make it intentional, her leg pressing further against Rio’s under the table. “Do you want to get into logistics,” she says, voice low and amused, “or are you going to answer the statement, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leans back slightly, watches her over the rim of her glass. “Alright,” she says. “What do you want to know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha takes a slow sip of her drink, sets the glass down gently, like she’s settling in, like there’s nowhere else she’d rather be. “Well,” she says, casual as anything, like they’re discussing the weather, “if I’m going to start visiting there…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glances up from beneath her lashes and looks at her. Her voice drops, smooth and measured. “…I need to know what to do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It hits Rio faster than she’s ready for. Her heart skips a beat, fumbles hard, then slams back into rhythm like it’s making up for lost time. She tries not to let it show, keeps her expression even, lets her mouth curve into a grin that’s a little cocky, a little crooked. “You wouldn’t want to do those things with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilts her head, as her foot shifts higher under the table, toe dragging slow up the inside of Rio’s calf, fire catching where it touches. Her voice is lower when she speaks again. “Humor me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows, shifts just slightly in her seat. Her fingers curl tighter around her glass, like she needs something to hold on to. “Well,” she starts, voice easy even though her pulse is anything but, “there’s this bar in the East Village that does really bad drag bingo. Like offensively bad. I used to go all the time until the host started recognizing me and calling me by a nickname in front of everyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorts into her drink, nearly chokes on a laugh, and Rio can’t help but smile wider at the sound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s this diner near my place,” Rio goes on, pushing past the heat in her face. “Open all night. The pie’s terrible, like genuinely awful, but at three in the morning, it’s perfect. Don’t ask me why. It just is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans in like she’s actually going to remember every word. Like she’s mentally mapping it out, one bite of bad pie at a time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I like walking the bridges sometimes,” Rio adds, a little quieter now. “Doesn’t really matter which one. I just like how the city looks from up there. The lights, the water. It feels different at night. Like it’s all pretending to be calm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice softens at the end, unintentionally. She hadn’t planned on that part slipping out with so much honesty. It just does. Rio clears her throat, suddenly feeling like she said too much. She shifts again, grounding herself in the familiar. “And, uh… there’s this bookstore in Brooklyn. There’s this cat that lives there. Total menace. Hates everyone.” Agatha arches a brow, intrigued. “Except me,” Rio finishes, “That’s probably the closest thing I have to a relationship out there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile spreads, but it doesn’t shift into something sharp or smug. It stays soft. Her foot moves again under the table. Higher now. Deliberate enough that Rio has to set her glass down before her hand betrays the way her body’s reacting. The air between them hums.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches her for a beat, swallows hard. “You writing all this down, or…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums, not even pretending to play innocent. Her eyes glitter across the table, lips curved just enough. “I don’t need to,” she murmurs, and her foot presses just a little further, “I’ll just make you take me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches Agatha like she’s trying to memorize every detail, her earrings, the way the light hits her cheekbone, the shape her mouth makes when she lifts her glass to her lips. Somehow, impossibly, she’s here. Sitting across from Agatha. Ontheir first date. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All because of Jen’s wedding. All because she came back, showed up, and stayed long enough. A chance she wasn’t looking for, and maybe didn’t deserve, but took anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leans in a little, elbow on the table, chin resting in her hand. Her eyes never leave Agatha’s face. “So, my turn,” she says, casual but curious, letting it stretch like she isn’t in a rush to get the answer, “tell me about Jen and Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinks once, surprised. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, soft and slow. “Because I want to know what they were like back then.” She pauses, then adds, gentler, “I want to know what you were like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze drops to her drink. She doesn’t answer right away. Just swirls the glass once, watching the liquid move. It’s thoughtful, almost distracted. “We were always… close,” she says eventually. Her voice is calm, even, but something about the way she says it feels like there’s more underneath. “I mean, we all grew up together, but they…” She trails off. Her mouth opens again, but nothing comes out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips press together in a line, her eyes fixed on the glass like it might offer an excuse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sees the shift. The slight pull in her expression, the hesitation that tightens her shoulders. “Honestly, Agatha,” she says, voice quieter now, but clearer somehow. “I want you to tell me. I want to hear all the good stuff. I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks up. There’s something almost uncertain in her eyes, something Rio can’t name. But then, slowly, she nods. Just once. And she tells her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She starts with high school. How Alice once crawled under the bleachers during gym to sneak in a nap and got locked under there for half the period. How Jen got detention three times in one week for arguing with their math teacher about whether logic and reason were the same thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughs when she says it, like the memory still catches her off guard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tells her about the time Alice broke her ankle trying to jump from the garage roof into the pool and missed the water entirely. About Jen’s brief, unrelenting nail tech phase that lasted two whole months and involved a lot of nail polish fumes. About a sleepover where they tried to summon a ghost with salt circles and candles, and ended up scaring themselves so badly they cried and she called Lilia to pick her up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio listens to every word like it’s precious. And to her surprise, none of it hurts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not the stories from years she wasn’t invited. Not the inside jokes she’s never heard before. Not the names of places or parties or moments she’ll never see. Not even the versions of Agatha that existed before Rio got close enough to know her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha lights up when she talks about them. And Rio can live with that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She can sit here in a quiet booth on a warm night, the hum of the restaurant around them soft and distant, and listen to Agatha talk about the people who helped shape her into this person, the one sitting in front of her now. Because maybe, if she’s lucky, if she does this right, if she’s careful, maybe she’ll get to be one of them too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand is resting on top of hers when their food arrives. A light touch. Barely there, but steady. Her thumb moves in slow, soft strokes against Rio’s skin, absentminded but intimate, like she’s not even thinking about it, like she’s done this a hundred times. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mid-sentence, rambling about azaleas and why they’re superior to rhododendrons. Something about the bloom shape, maybe the soil pH. She’s not even sure anymore, just knows she’s talking and Agatha’s listening with that quiet, amused look on her face that makes Rio want to keep going.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Agatha’s hand twitches. And then pulls away fast like she touched something she shouldn’t have.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t catch it right away. Not really. She finishes her sentence, reaches for her fork, but then she hears it. Agatha’s breath hitching, soft but audible, followed by a quiet, clipped curse under her breath. When Rio glances back, Agatha’s already straightened her spine like she’s bracing for something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Incoming,” Agatha mutters, jaw tight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowns, confused. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she sees it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Standing right in front of their table like she’s part of the party. Billy’s beside her, posture rigid, eyes flicking everywhere except at the two of them. Another kid stands at his side, holding his hand, smaller and visibly uncomfortable. Maybe a friend, cousin, classmate, it doesn’t matter. Both of them look like they do not  want to be here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hope we’re not interrupting anything!” Wanda says, voice falsely bright, like she’s trying too hard to sound breezy. It doesn’t land. It never does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forces a smile for the boys. Just them. Doesn’t bother sparing Wanda a glance. Not worth it. She’s spent enough energy on that dynamic already and has no interest in giving it anything more tonight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glances instead at Agatha, whose jaw is clenched so tightly the muscles flicker along her cheek. Lips pressed into something that’s not quite a line but not quite a frown. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy’s gaze shifts. Up at Wanda, over to Agatha, then down again. He looks like he wants to disappear. The kid beside him squeezes his hand tighter, like he’s trying to anchor them both to the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sees the collision before it happens. The emotional weather shifting in real time. The way Agatha’s walls snap into place, the way Billy’s shoulders tense. She reacts fast, instinctively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not,” she says smoothly, nudging her plate like it’s nothing. “Would you three like to join us? Though, fair warning, I’m not stopping. This is really good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not about the offer. It’s about control. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda blinks, thrown by the invitation. It wasn’t what she was expecting. Both too kind to be condescending, too confident to be threatened. She doesn’t know how to twist it. Can’t find the handle to turn it into something sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she can pivot, Billy steps in. “Oh no. We are not staying for this.” His voice is dry, pointed. He side-eyes Wanda without subtlety. “We can go somewhere else. It’s fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, he cuts the tension in half.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightens again, softer this time. She smiles, areal, small, meant only for him. Rio saw it right before photos. “Honey, if you’d like to join us, we were just talking about Aunt Jen and Aunt Alice. And azaleas.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio picks it up without missing a beat. “They were some wild high schoolers, apparently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy looks at the boy next to him. The kid shrugs like he doesn’t care either way, just wants this moment to be over. Billy glances back at Agatha, and he nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay. Yeah. Let’s join.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s already standing, motion smooth. “I’ll grab the waiter,” she says, and she means it. But she doesn’t get far.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of heels follows her, quick and deliberate against the tile floor. Measured steps she recognizes instantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t even have to look to know who it is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me help,” Wanda says, already at her side, practically fused to her like a shadow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perfect. Rio’s going to get cornered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They haven’t even reached the host stand yet, but Wanda clearly sees her opening and lunges for it. She’s smiling sweetly, pressing in like she always does when there’s something she wants. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry, Rio,” she says, syrupy and smooth. “We really didn’t mean to interrupt!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t stop walking, doesn’t flinch, just lets her eyes slide to Wanda’s for a second. Just long enough to remind her she sees right through it. “What do you want, Wanda?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda blinks, faux surprise dripping from her lashes. “Oh, nothing, truly.” One hand flutters to her chest like she’s offended. “We were already coming here for dinner. Picked the boys up after their movie and they were starved. Had to stop somewhere and lo and behold! You both are here too! Total coincidence!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio halts. Dead in her tracks. Wanda stumbles, nearly colliding into her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turns slowly, calm but sharp. Tilts her head just enough. “Cut the shit, Wanda.” Wanda laughs. It comes out  low, barely a breath of amusement. “Why can’t you just leave me, leave us, alone?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a second, Wanda’s mask cracks. Her expression tightens, like she’s swallowing something bitter. Then it shifts, not softer but more calculated. “Because I told you,” she murmurs, voice lowered now, meant only for Rio. “You didn’t give me the chance to go with you. To New York.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t blink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just lets the silence stretch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda edges a little closer, “And I heard you just signed with that big event company. Congratulations, by the way.” Her tone drips with forced sweetness. “I thought maybe you could use the company. While you’re so busy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she reaches for Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s automatic. Rio jerks back like she’s touched something sharp. Like the idea of Wanda’s skin on hers makes her recoil on instinct.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because not a chance in hell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Wanda can recover from the rejection, before Rio can even decide if she wants to say something more, Agatha appears. As if she was summoned. She slides in between them with surgical precision, as if she’s been waiting for just the right second to sever the moment in two.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her tone is calm. Controlled. Icy and polite in the most dangerous way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh good,” Agatha says, smiling in a way that promises nothing kind. She shifts, placing herself in Wanda’s line of fire without even blinking. “I was just thinking, this evening was going far too well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda falters. “Agatha…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda,” Agatha replies, flat and unfazed. “Is this the part where you pretend you came here just for the breadsticks?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda opens her mouth, as if to protest or twist the story into something gentler, but Agatha doesn’t let her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or,” she continues, head tilted, tone still too polite to be sincere, “do you want to try again with that charming bit about coincidence? Because frankly, it’s exhausting. You show up like clockwork every time Rio and I so much as exhale in the same building.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she glances at Rio and lets her hand brush lightly against her wrist, just once. As if she’s grounding them both. “I’m sorry, am I interrupting?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips twitch, fighting back a smirk that wants to crawl across her face. “No, sweetheart,” she says, warm and dry, “you’re not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes narrow. Her jaw ticks. “I didn’t realize you two were actually together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inhales sharply, hand to her chest, mocking surprise. “Actually together?” She smiles, slow and mean, then leans in with just enough weight. “Yes you did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turns slightly, her body still angled toward Wanda. “The waiter’s grabbing a few more menus for the table. You’re welcome to join the kids at the table,” she says, voice low. “But if you’re here for anything other than a meal, I suggest you find another restaurant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s no room for a response. Agatha turns without waiting, heels cracking against the floor like punctuation, like she’s making sure every single step is heard and felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t hesitate. She follows, biting the inside of her cheek just to keep herself from letting the grin surface. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because that? That was hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And to Rio’s surprise, Wanda behaves through dinner. Mostly because Agatha insisted she sit next to her. Pointedly. Smiling too wide when she patted the seat beside her ex-wife and said, “Come sit, Wanda.” She even pulled the chair out for her. Smiled while doing it. The kind of smile that dared her to decline.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Rio ends up next to Billy, who’s halfway through retelling every beat of the movie he just saw. He’s so animated about it he barely breathes between bites. His fork lifts, lowers, stabs something off his plate, and he keeps going without pause, like he’s on a mission to recite the entire plot before his food’s gone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Eddie’s on his other side, quieter, but about halfway through the meal he leans across Billy and starts asking Rio detailed, bizarrely intense questions about azaleas. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Wanda behaves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha absolutely does not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She waits until the table has settled into conversation, until the drinks have been topped off and bread passed around again, and then she slips her hand under the tablecloth like she’s reaching for something innocent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio should’ve known better. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She feels the first light touch just above her knee. Just her fingertips, nothing more. But they climb, slow and deliberate, dragging over fabric and skin, and stop just short of something truly dangerous. Not touching, not quite, but hovering in that space that’s enough to make Rio twitch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She holds it there. Gentle, steady pressure on the inside of Rio’s thigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s not sure if it’s about jealousy or possession or just Agatha getting bored of being well-behaved. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio doesn’t really care. Not when her pinky flexes just slightly, sending heat crawling up Rio’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finally does squeeze, it’s subtle. But firm. Like she doesn’t plan on letting go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio keeps her posture steady. Doesn’t shift, doesn’t glance down, doesn’t give a single goddamn thing away. Just calmly reaches for her wallet when the check arrives and pays before anyone notices, pen scratching against the receipt while Agatha’s nail drags one last cruel line up her thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t react. Just signs her name with steady fingers. Even pays for Wanda’s overpriced entrée without blinking. That’s how far gone she is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Rio finally glances up, Agatha is already on her feet. She’s collected, almost unbothered, like she’s not the reason Rio can barely think straight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy and Eddie flank her like she’s royalty, one on either side, heading for the front with her head held high like she owns the entire place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s just standing when Wanda leans in, voice low, maybe trying for something that sounds like gratitude but lands like a warning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for dinner, Rio,” she murmurs, eyes unreadable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods once. That’s all she gives her. Keeps it short. Keeps it moving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha’s already walking, and Rio’s not about to be the one left behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Wanda doesn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She takes a single, calculated step closer, like she’s thinking about saying more but hasn’t decided if it’s worth it yet. Her eyes don’t stay on Rio for long. They drift, almost inevitably, to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she smiles. That slow, pitying smile that makes Rio’s stomach turn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me know if you change your mind about needing better company in New York.” Wanda murmurs, casual in tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodbye, Wanda.” Rio doesn’t even bother looking back at her. Just follows the path Agatha took out of the restaurant. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The drive home is almost perfectly still. The silence doesn’t crack until they get home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And when it does, it shatters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as the door shuts behind them, Agatha spins. Fast. Sharp. So fast it knocks the air out of Rio’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her back hits the door with a thud, wood vibrating behind her, and before she can say a word, Agatha’s already there. No hesitation. No space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands slam to the frame on either side of Rio’s face. Not gentle. Not romantic. Like she’s cornering her prey. “You didn’t pull away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks, stunned by the force of her, “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans in until their foreheads nearly touch, her voice a dangerous whisper. “When she touched you. In the restaurant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were right there,” Rio says, steady despite the pounding in her chest. “You saw me pull back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers curl into the fabric of Rio’s shirt like she’s bracing herself, “Not fast enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she kisses her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not gentle. It’s not slow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely has time to breathe before she’s moving backwards, stumbling with each step until the backs of her knees hit the couch. Agatha’s hands are already under her shirt, nails dragging hard and fast up her sides, leaving behind lines that sting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think I’m letting her even look at you like that again?” Agatha hisses, voice sharp with something close to fury. Her knee pushes between Rio’s thighs, deliberate and demanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She said she wanted to keep you company in New York,” Agatha continues, relentless now. Each word spit like a curse. “Like I’d let her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio breathes out a laugh, breathless and wrecked, her head tipping back. “Jesus, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not fear. Not anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s heat. It’s surrender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand slides up to grip her chin, firm and possessive. She tilts Rio’s head so she’s forced to meet her gaze. “You’re mine,” she says again. Lower now. Like it’s a vow. A threat. A promise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not a question. It’s a warning. Sharp and final and entirely unshakable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t blink. Doesn’t hesitate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No. She spurs her on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She leans in close, heat rolling off her in waves. Her breath ghosts along the edge of Agatha’s jaw as her voice drops to something low and wicked. “If Wanda was married to you,” she murmurs, lips brushing the shell of her ear, “don’t you think she’d already know how possessive you are? So why push tonight, knowing exactly how you’d respond?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The reaction is immediate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reels back like the words slapped her. But her grip never loosens. Her fist stays clenched in the front of Rio’s shirt like she’s barely holding herself back. “I wasn’t possessive over her,” she says, voice like cut glass. “She didn’t get that side of me.” Her fingers twist tighter in the fabric, pulling Rio forward until there’s no air between them. “But you do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t wait for a reply. Doesn’t give Rio time to swallow the weight of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turns, dragging her by the shirt, purposeful and fast. The hallway blurs around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Halfway to the bedroom, Agatha pins her again. This time harder, more desperate, more deliberate. The wall shudders with the force of it. Her thigh wedges between Rio’s legs like it belongs there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want her near you,” Agatha growls, breath hot against Rio’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets her head fall back against the wall, breath ragged. “Then maybe you should make sure she knows that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile is slow and dangerous. All teeth. “I’m going to make sure you do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t waste another second. Just grabs her and walks them both into the bedroom. The door slams shut behind them, a final punctuation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s no question in Agatha’s eyes. No hesitation in her hands. She pushes Rio back until her knees hit the mattress and she goes down without resistance, landing on her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha follows. Crawling over her with that slow, devastating confidence, like a predator that already knows it’s won. She doesn’t even need to touch her to hold her down. Her eyes do all the work. Her hands run up Rio’s body, and she can’t help but arch into the touch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When her palm finally finds Rio’s throat, her hand doesn’t tighten. Instead it just rests there, grounding, claiming, steady enough to steal every breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want to be mine?” Agatha whispers, so soft it sounds more like a confession than a question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I already am,” Rio breathes, and she means it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Means it so much it hurts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flutter shut, like she’s praying not to break under the weight of that answer. Or maybe she already is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then her mouth finds Rio’s collarbone. And bites. Hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not teasing. Not careful. Not the way she normally is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No more softness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t fight it. Doesn’t flinch or pull away. She tilts her head instead, baring her neck like a gift. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth moves up, lips brushing just below the hinge of Rio’s jaw, and then she bites again. No warning. No mercy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yours,” Rio gasps, and the sound of it rips something open in Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She growls, low and rough and desperate, pushing her hips down against Rio’s with a pressure that’s all proof. Not just heat. Not just want. Possession.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snaps out of the heat for just a second. She needs to clarify. She needs Agatha to know. “Baby,” Rio says softly, “you know I don’t even think about Wanda, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t respond at first. She just looks at her, searching her face like she’s trying to find the lie. But Rio knows there’s nothing there. Just her, open and steady, waiting without pushing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” she says. Her voice is quiet, barely there, and it shakes just enough for Rio to hear it. “I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiles, thumb brushing along the curve of her cheek, like she’s tracing something delicate and real. “Okay. Great. Just wanted to make sure we both felt secure.” Her grin turns crooked. “Please continue.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughs, “Get out of your clothes, then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio follows her direction like it’s an order. Agatha does the same. Then, without warning, she grabs Rio’s wrist and pins it right back above her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their chests press together, and Rio’s breath stutters in her throat, her body arching to meet the contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kisses her and then she’s gone again, dragging her mouth lower, kissing and biting her way down Rio’s body like she’s starving for it. No hesitation. She takes her time, letting the pressure build, letting Rio feel the weight of each mark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tries not to squirm. She tries not to twitch. But every time Agatha’s mouth finds a new spot, her muscles jump, her legs tense, her head tips back like she’s offering up more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Each mark is a claim. A tether.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A reminder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finally moves lower, when her fingers drag the length of Rio’s center, slow and maddening, Rio gasps. It comes out sharp and startled, her whole body jolting like a live wire. It’s barely a touch, just enough to make her nerves light up, but it knocks the air from her lungs anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath catches. Her hips lift. Her back arches like her body is chasing what little Agatha’s given her, desperate to close the distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks against her skin, pleased and in control. The hand on Rio’s abdomen presses down, firm and steady, holding her in place. Her other hand finds Rio’s again, sliding their fingers together and pinning it back to the sheets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bites down on the inside of her cheek, trying to keep it together. But it’s unraveling fast. Her moans break through her teeth in messy gasps, quiet and shaky and barely restrained.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t do that,” Agatha murmurs, her voice cutting through the haze, steady and commanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinks down at her, dazed and flushed, trying to focus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leans in close, brushing her nose against Rio’s cheek, her breath warm and intimate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to hear you,” she says, soft but deadly serious, like it’s not a request, but a rule.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio, with her heart pounding, body wrecked, and head spinning, can only nod.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she’s dropping between her thighs. Her tongue finds it almost immediately. That devastating spot that makes Rio’s spine go rigid, that knocks the air out of her lungs like a punch and leaves her grasping for something to hold onto. Her hips jerk up instinctively, chasing it, helpless to the way it shatters her control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatham” Rio gasps, loud and unfiltered, her voice cracking. Agatha’s humming against her like that sound alone might finish her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t pull back. Doesn’t waver. Just stays right there. Steady and merciless and perfect, like she’s made it her mission to undo her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every time her thighs twitch or her breath stutters, Agatha adjusts. Not to soothe, but to sharpen. Her rhythm doesn’t break, doesn’t hesitate. It builds like a storm, precise and punishing. Controlled chaos. Each movement is intentional, each flick of her tongue and curl of her lips a study in destruction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio can’t stop moving, not really, but Agatha’s grip doesn’t let her get far. Her hand spreads firm against Rio’s stomach, holding her down, keeping her still with just enough pressure to say, stay right here. And Rio tries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her other hand is still tangled with Agatha’s, fingers locked tight like she’s holding on for dear life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe she is. Maybe she needs to. Because it’s not just her body that’s unraveling. It’s everything. Her mind, her heartbeat, her ability to think in anything but broken syllables and sensations and her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, somehow, her eyes manage to open and they find Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hair dark against Rio’s skin, catching the light in soft waves. Her mouth, her jaw, her shoulders tense with focus, like this is something sacred. Like she’s not just doing this to win or prove something, but because she wants to. Because she needs to. Because loving Rio like this is the only thing that makes sense right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it shows. It’s all over her. The way she moves. The way she listens for every breath, every desperate noise Rio can’t keep in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, you’re so—” Rio tries, but the sentence burns out halfway. She doesn’t know what she was going to say. Doesn’t matter. She’s beyond language now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha doesn’t slow to give her the chance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If anything, her grip tightens just slightly, a subtle squeeze of reassurance. Her tongue stays relentless, tracing every nerve-ending like she has no intention of stopping until Rio is wrecked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she’s close. So close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her moans shift from startled to pleading, deep and urgent, spilling out in a rhythm that matches Agatha’s, fast and trembling and wild. She can’t think, can’t plan, can’t do anything but feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because for once, Rio isn’t in control. And she doesn’t want it back. Not here. Not now. Not when Agatha is dragging her down with intention, purpose, and a heat so consuming it threatens to swallow her whole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just when she thinks she can’t take another second, Agatha glances up, eyes dark and locked on hers and smiles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s all it takes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio breaks apart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It slams through her like a wave cresting too high and crashing too hard. Her body arches, a long, unrestrained cry tearing from her throat as she tries, and fails, not to thrust too hard into Agatha’s mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t pull back. If anything, she tightens her grip, holds her steady, mouth sealed to her like she wants to drink the release from her, like she needs to feel every shudder and tremor firsthand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And fuck, does Rio fall for her. Completely. Without a shred of resistance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her free hand claws at the sheets like it might ground her, but there’s no grounding left. Not when Agatha’s still holding her like that, not when the pleasure keeps echoing through her toes like it doesn’t want to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Agatha finally slows, finally pulls back with a slow, deliberate drag of her tongue, Rio’s whole body is trembling. Her legs still twitching, breath ragged, heart thundering in her chest. Her skin is flushed, damp, oversensitive, like even the air touching her is too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, and she does it so casually, so smugly, her expression somewhere between proud and completely blissed out She crawls up the length of Rio’s body and collapses on top of her with zero grace, like she’s exactly where she belongs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A content little sigh escapes her lips, smug and soft and fully satisfied. Like Rio had just made Agatha come instead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wraps her arms around her without thinking, needing the weight of her, the heat, the press of her body. Her chest is still rising and falling like she’s just run a marathon. Every breath feels too loud, too shaky, too alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They’re both quiet for a second, dazed, breathless, and then Agatha giggles. A real, delighted little laugh, muffled against Rio’s bare shoulder, soft and warm and totally unguarded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha says, voice low and gleeful and unmistakably smug. “Mine?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs out a breath. It’s part laugh, part exhale, part still trying to remember how her body works after all that. “You’re ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just hums, smiling into her skin like she’s the one who just won something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leans in and kisses her without thinking, without hesitation. A soft, messy, open-mouthed kiss that tastes like sweat and heat and her, and Rio can’t help but deepen it. She swallows the smug noise Agatha makes, presses in closer until they’re tangled together again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All yours,” she breathes against her lips. “As you are mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha melts into her, the pleased little sound she makes vibrating straight down Rio’s spine. She kisses her again, deeper, with more intent and for a second it feels like they might just sink into this and stay here forever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio shifts under her, something sharp and playful lighting up in her eyes, and before Agatha can make sense of it, Rio grips her hips and flips them with practiced ease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lands with a breathy little <em>oof</em>, hair splayed across the pillow, eyes wide and blinking up at her in surprise. Rio can feel her smile stretched across her cheeks, smug in its own right now, the perfect mirror of what Agatha wore minutes ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now,” she says, voice a little lower, a little rougher, as she leans down and brushes her mouth along the line of Agatha’s jaw, “my turn.”</span>
