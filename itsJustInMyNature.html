<em> I get the job done… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Riri, you love me very much, don’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns. Lilia, her godmother, only pulls out the nickname she’d used as a toddler when she wants something. Last time, Rio had ended up tearing out Lilia’s old tub and installing the new, ocean blue one for her. The time before that, she’d repainted Lilia’s kitchen cabinets.</p><p> </p><p>She was Lilia’s wrench monkey, essentially. </p><p> </p><p>“I got a letter from my HOA stating my yard is a mess.” Lilia’s mouth turns into a frown. “Bunch of pretentious fucks. I’d pay you for the labor, of course, since it’s your hustle, and all.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s shoulders sag a little in relief. Landscaping, she can do. Landscaping, she does for a living. “I’ll give you the family discount.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t say no to that.” Lilia takes a sip of her tea. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you have in mind?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia shrugs. “You can do whatever you want with it. I just want those people to stop nailing things to my door. It’s a very nice cherry oak and I don’t appreciate it getting manhandled by the local WASPs.”</p><p> </p><p>It takes a week, because it’s the beginning of March and orders are starting to pick up, but Rio draws up some plans. Her team isn’t much; it consists of her best friend, Alice, and Billy and Tommy, two high school boys, which means anything done during normal business hours is usually done by her or Alice. Rio will have to do Lilia’s on her own time.</p><p> </p><p>The first day she’s able to do it is because of a cancellation on a Tuesday morning; Rio starts off by mowing the lawn and trimming the hedges. She’s more of a natural lawn girl herself, but she can find a way to keep to HOA “standards” while letting native vegetation thrive in Lilia’s yard. Not only is Lilia’s grass ridiculously overgrown, but there’s a lot of loose stones and branches, which means she has to put a pause on the lawn mower and start picking things up manually. Even though it’s only in the mid-fifties, she starts sweating in her overalls and white tee.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is wheeling clumps of loose soil, leaves, and twigs, prepared to take them to one of the many garbage bins she has lined up near her truck and trailer, when she hears a muffled curse.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” It’s a woman’s voice. “Where the hell is it?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns her head towards the voice, and she sees a woman around her age shuffling papers on a kitchen counter. A sharp jawline, long and wavy brown hair… oh.</p><p> </p><p>This woman is in her underwear. And not the kind of underwear Rio wears (today’s being a Nike sports bra and the Christmas-themed Snoopy boxer briefs Alice had gotten her as a gag gift three years ago). No, this underwear was nice, probably expensive, and a single step up from lingerie in terms of what it covers. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face was already warm and sweaty from working in the early spring sun, but now her face is heated for another reason. She tries to turn away, pretend like she never saw anything, but before her mind can battle against her body and rip her eyes from this fucking bombshell, blue eyes glance her way and catch her in the act. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey!” It’s at this that Rio notices that not only is this woman prancing around in her underwear near open windows, but the window is a little cracked, making Rio able to hear this woman crystal clearly. “What do you think you’re—”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth opens to say something, anything— working really hard to not look like a fish out of water— but her wheelbarrow hits a stray rock in Lilia’s yard and she falls headfirst into the pile of literal dirt.</p><p> </p><p>Well, that’s what she gets for being dirty. Rio gives herself some mental self-chastising as she pushes herself out of the wheelbarrow and does her best to pick stray twigs from her hair and brush the dirt off her overalls. She’s still doing this when the woman, still in her underwear but now only slightly more covered in an open silk robe, marches towards her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m really sorry,” Rio says. She shields her eyes from the woman. “I… I’m Rio, and—” She yelps as the woman smacks her, open-palmed, across the cheek. It stings. “What was that for?”</p><p> </p><p>“At least look at me while you’re speaking.” Women should not sound this attractive when they’re angry, especially when they’re angry at Rio. Rio peeks between her fingers before setting her hand fully down. This woman is even more mouth-watering up close, which is doing nothing to offset the short-circuiting sparking in Rio’s poor lesbian brain. </p><p> </p><p>Because now, she can see freckles. And while this woman’s bra is opaque, it’s thin, and Rio knows what covered nipple piercings look like when she sees them. Light, wispy hairs lead from her belly button to where her underwear starts, and if Rio looks very carefully…</p><p> </p><p>Which, she isn’t. Rio needs to stick her head in her wheelbarrow like an ostrich in the sand so she can die by self-inflicted asphyxiation before making herself look like even more of a fool. </p><p> </p><p>The woman laughs sardonically at Rio’s pathetic reaction. “Oh, wait, my bad. You already got a good look, didn’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>At this, Rio feels her temper rising. “It’s not my fault you’re standing in front of your window in just your underwear.”</p><p> </p><p>“I should be able to do whatever I want in my own home without some pervert spying on me!” The woman puts her hands on her hips, and all Rio can think about is how it shows off her figure.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not a pervert!” Rio shouts. God, she hopes the neighbors aren’t watching. “And I wasn’t spying, I was trying to do my job.”</p><p> </p><p>“And what is that, exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio motions around her as if it isn’t obvious. “Landscaping?” She looks down and it’s this moment she realizes this woman has no socks or shoes on. “Um, you really shouldn’t be barefoot out here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, because you’re into that sort of thing?” The woman glances at Rio’s company truck. “<em>Vidal’s Vegetative Services</em>. I’ll get the Better Business Bureau to shut you down. I’ll have you tied up in red tape at court before you can say—”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop that!” Rio draws the line at the business she’s built from the ground up, literally. “Do you seriously think I somehow knew you’d be prancing around your house in lingerie when I showed up to work this morning? Be serious. I mentioned you being barefoot because I’m about to start some spray treatments and it can give sensitive skin a rash if you’re not careful.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman’s shoulders slump, but her eyes still hold some fire. “You were staring so hard you were practically catching flies. Want to explain that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio throws her hands up in exasperation. “It’s not my fault you’re hot!” At the woman’s eyebrow raise, Rio feels her blush expand to her neck, and she huffs. “You know what? I don’t have time for this.” She fishes out one of her business cards from her main chest pocket. “You can complain all you want at this number. I have work to do.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman stares at the business card before folding it. Rio expects her to tuck it into her bra, or maybe litter, but what she does is stuff it in her mouth. And chew. She then looks at Rio and says, clearly, “I’d never waste my time calling your number.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gapes. “Did you.. swallow that? That was cardstock.”</p><p> </p><p>“Gonna put your fingers in my mouth to find out?” The woman glances at Rio’s stained hands. “I’d ask that you at least wash your hands first.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth is still open as the woman saunters away.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio walks into Lilia’s kitchen to get a glass of water, she tries to segue the neighbor fiasco in the most normal way possible. “Who do you live by?” Nailed it.</p><p> </p><p>“I saw everything,” Lilia admits, and Rio groans.</p><p> </p><p>“Does she usually walk around in her house like that?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia shrugs. “I don’t make it a habit to stare into my neighbors’ windows.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t do it on purpose,” Rio hisses. Embarrassed at how defensive she’d gotten, because frankly, she shouldn’t <em> have </em> to be, she stands up a little straighter. “And I know you know that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha’s kind of a firecracker,” Lilia says, and she hands Rio a banana, knowing it’s a good food for Rio to eat and then throw the part she touched with her hands straight into the bin. “Once you get past her layers of chaos and scorn, she’s pretty sweet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Must be plenty of layers, then,” Rio mumbles, and glumly bites into her banana. Maybe that’s why she barely wears anything in her house: too many internal layers to deal with outer ones, too. Hmph. “Her name Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not telling you anything else,” Lilia sniffs. “I will not take part in any of the neighborhood gossip.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, my bad, I forgot; you only do that on even days, and it’s the third.” Lilia smacks Rio on her arm for that one.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio gets back to the swanked out side garage she’d converted for a headquarters, of sorts, for the business, she realizes the business has gotten a new two-star review:</p><p> </p><p>A. Harkness, ★★: <em>This place employs perverts. Two stars instead of one because at least the perverts they hire aren’t ugly.</em></p><p> </p><p>The next time she’s able to make it to Lilia’s place for work purposes is Friday, and while she doesn’t see Agatha, she <em> does </em> get some business with Agatha’s other neighbor, Mrs. Davis, who had seen her holding a pair of branch clippers and had complimented her work.</p><p> </p><p>“I have a green thumb, but I can’t do all the labor like I used to,” Mrs. Davis says. “If I give you my plans, will you help me out?”</p><p> </p><p>And so when Rio is up bright and early Monday morning planting daffodils in the elderly widow’s yard, she sees, through her peripherals, Agatha “A. Harkness” picking up a recently tossed newspaper. And she’s in her fucking underwear again. It’s lilac, and if Rio squints, is there a floral pattern on there?</p><p> </p><p>She squeezes her fingers into her palms and realizes too late she’s strangled a daffodil. “Goddammit.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whips her head around, and even from this distance, Rio could get lost at sea in her eyes. “You again. I can’t even grab my morning paper without the neighborhood creep leering at me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stands up like a fuse has been lit under her ass, her fists clenched at her sides. The poor daffodil curls limply in her suffocating hold; it’s a goner. “I’m not a creep! You’re in public!”</p><p> </p><p>“What was that?” Agatha cups her ears. “Your mouth isn’t as disgustingly penetrative as your eyes, my dear.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio throws the flower in her grasp to the ground and reaches Agatha in only a half dozen strides. “You are in broad daylight, woman. You seriously cannot yell out here that I’m a creep. I have a business to run.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re in my yard,” Agatha states. “I could call the police for trespassing.”</p><p> </p><p>“And, what, waste valuable tax dollars only for the police to walk away because they can’t fucking do anything about me standing? You don’t seem like the type.” Rio throws her hands around. “I’d barely call this a yard, anyway. When’s the last time someone came in and shaped these hedges?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks. “I like my hedges untrimmed, thank you very much.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels her eye involuntarily twitch. As Agatha turns to walk back into her house, Rio notices an extremely intricate rune tattooed on her back. She clenches her jaw before blurting out, “You’re a witch?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whips her head around to face Rio, and she shoots Rio a smug grin. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m a green witch,” Rio offers lamely.</p><p> </p><p>“I know, honey.” Agatha laughs, and then walks back to her front door. Rio can’t tell if Agatha’s swinging her hips or she’s just imagining things. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a new review when Rio gets home. ★: <em> This business will insult your lawn and trespass your property if you don’t accept their advances to pay for their services. The representative of this place also looked extremely menacing, showing me her toned and muscular arms as if she was threatening to physically harm me.  </em></p><p> </p><p>And this is how it happens for another week. Rio works on yard work either at Lilia or Mrs. Davis’s place, and Agatha is wearing something skimpy every time. They’re different sets, too, because Rio distinctly remembers each one. She can practically see them when she closes her eyes. Agatha leaves her own interpretation of the events for the public eye to see, if they so wish.</p><p> </p><p>★: <em> The employee I interacted with, an attractive woman who I think goes by the name “Rio,” yelled at me for sunbathing in my own front yard. She’s contracted by my neighbor, not me, so I cannot fathom why what I do on my personal property, that I absolutely and certainly pay timely taxes on, seems to upset her. When I politely explained this to her, she rudely flipped me off, and then did not answer when I asked for the specific measurement for the length of said finger. </em></p><p> </p><p>★★: <em> Employee would not stop staring at my chest the entire time I talked to her; I had questions about the validity of this company’s services. I was really offended because I’m more than just my breasts. I do an entire workout regimen to have a great ass, too. </em></p><p> </p><p>★: <em> Employees who work here have no sort of professional dress code. I understand manual labor is involved, but there are children who live on my street, and a tanned woman in a sports bra and athletic shorts could frighten them from playing outside of their own home. Also, when I went to ask a question about whether or not this employee was wearing women or men’s shorts (pertinent if you understood the situation) she blatantly ignored me. </em></p><p> </p><p>“What if I really am a pervert?” she asks Alice during a shared lunch break.</p><p> </p><p>Alice groans. “Dude, the first time, it was an accident, but she’s clearly doing it to get a rise out of you. Or she wants to fuck you. Probably both.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio balks at this. “Wait, what?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice whips out her phone. “I’m going to resend you that RAADS-R test link, and I really recommend you take it this time.”</p><p> </p><p>On Saturday, Rio is blissfully free to do whatever she wants, but there’s only one thing on her mind. If Agatha wants to play a game, Rio can step up to the plate.</p><p> </p><p>She finds herself knocking on Agatha’s door wearing a tank and sweatpants, the kind tapered at the ankle. When Agatha answers, she’s wearing a night slip. This was probably what she actually wore to bed.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to be working today.” A lie. “I don’t need you distracting me.” Somewhat of another lie.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks past Rio’s shoulder to the curb. “I don’t see your company truck, or any equipment.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, trust me,” and at this, Rio’s smile was all teeth, “I brought equipment. I’m here to draw up plans with a customer.”</p><p> </p><p>“And, pray tell, why are you coming to my house to tell me this?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because,” Rio reasons, “said customer is about to let me in.” Rio’s gaze drops down to Agatha’s silk nightgown, at the way it hides nothing of Agatha’s figure, of the swell of her breasts and the barbells that rest in them. “You wear that for me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio knows the answer to this question, but she smirks as she watches Agatha’s sternum fight off a blush. “You’re very presumptuous.” </p><p> </p><p>“What do you call this week, exactly?” Rio’s voice drops down an octave when she says, “Let me in, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitches, but she backs away, letting Rio step into the house and shut the front door. “So, you stalked me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha Harkness, twenty-seven, lead architect at Stark Industries. Don’t act high and mighty about it. I know those reviews are yours. You’ve probably done the same.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs nonchalantly. “You look good for thirty-three considering you work in the sun.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sunscreen twice a day, sweetheart. And you’re fairly young to have such a prestigious position at a company as big as Stark’s,” Rio shoots back.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m talented with my fingers.” Agatha wiggles them for a dramatic effect. “For sketching, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh huh.” Rio’s fingers brush over Agatha’s covered torso, and she can feel the lust tightly coil in her stomach as Agatha’s lips part. Rio says, “So, instead of asking me to dinner, you chose to wear lingerie while I was on the clock?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve never been conventional,” Agatha admits. “Oh! And to see you fight fire with fire. Wonderful thing to find out, really.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t know the half of it.” Rio’s hand snakes up the slip, which only comes to the tops of Agatha’s thighs, anyway. When her fingers brush over the small of Agatha’s bare back, the younger woman lets out a sudden, sharp cry. Rio pulls back instantly. Maybe Alice was wrong, and Rio had really, truly fucked up. “Did I do something wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, no.” Agatha is breathing heavily. “My… you touched my rune. It’s a protection rune. When touched by another magic user, it heightens my senses. Like adrenaline.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio thinks she stops breathing in that moment. She’d assumed Agatha had given some sort of pained noise, or one of distress, but the realization creeps up on her and then pounces; Agatha had cried in <em> pleasure.</em></p><p> </p><p>She isn’t sure who pulled in whom— all Rio knows is that, now, she can feel Agatha’s lips on hers, and Rio’s hand finds its way to cradle Agatha’s head. Agatha moans into the kiss when Rio starts scratching at her scalp. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches and pulls Rio in by her hips. When she cups Rio’s groin, she pauses, her lips millimeters from Rio’s. “Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>And the way Agatha says her name, a twisted combination of surprise, irritation, and lust, makes Rio want to tape record it so she can use it as white noise to fall asleep to. “Yes?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re fucking <em> packing</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks. “I told you. I brought the proper equipment.”</p><p> </p><p>“God,” Agatha mumbles, “where the fuck have you been all my life.” She clears her throat. “Get on the couch. Now.”</p><p> </p><p>Just to keep a little dignity, Rio goes for the chaise instead, stretching her arms to fit around its back as she watches Agatha stalk towards her like she’s prey. Not that Rio is complaining, really. Agatha rolls her eyes at Rio’s decision to sit somewhere else, but follows Rio to where she’s sitting and straddles her. It causes her slip to ride up and for Rio to see the plain white hipsters she has on for underwear.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” Rio cups Agatha’s sex through her panties. “You really weren’t planning for me to come here.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blushes, and Rio revels in that. Agatha just barks out, “Take off your shirt.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio obediently lifts her tank above her head, leaving her in a plain back sports bra. Agatha wastes no time reaching under it and pinching her nipples, which has Rio arching into Agatha’s touch and giving her a whimper. </p><p> </p><p>“What a good boy,” Agatha croons, and Rio’s mouth opens further in a wanton gasp. Agatha chuckles and teases her with, “Be careful, or you’ll be lolling your tongue out and panting before you know it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off.” Rio’s hands are gripping Agatha’s bare hips, her slip having ridden up to her soft stomach. When she pushes it up further, Agatha gets the message and pulls it over her head, leaving her only in her underwear. Her piercings are practically begging for Rio to touch them, and so she does, pinching a nipple.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her hips into Rio’s lap, right on top of the silicone strap Rio has tucked into her pants, and it makes her dizzy. “God, just like that.” When Rio’s other hand barely brushes its fingertips over where she knows the tattoo on Agatha’s back is, Agatha’s gasps turn wet. She says, “Unless you want me to come untouched, I wouldn’t recommend you keep doing that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I like the ego boost,” Rio admits, though her hand skirts down to cup Agatha’s ass. Mmm.</p><p> </p><p>“But, baby, I want you to get some pleasure from it, too.” Agatha’s bottom lip juts out pointedly, and, Christ, Rio’s known this woman for all of two weeks but the pet name has her brain feeling fuzzy like the static from one of those old television screens. “You don’t wanna fuck me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I do.” Rio presses a hot, wet kiss to Agatha’s collarbone. “But you haven’t prepared me yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha threads her fingers through Rio’s loose hair. “If you want me to suck your cock, all you have to do is ask.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leans herself back into the chaise, her hands still on Agatha’s moving hips. “Suck my cock, then.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilts her head at an angle, and she sets her hand, palm facing down, on the meat of Rio’s crotch. “I said <em> ask</em>, pretty boy. Give it to me as a question.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels like there’s something stuck in the back of her throat when she gasps out, “Can you suck my cock?”</p><p> </p><p>“There we go.” Agatha gives Rio a kiss and a nip on the lobe of her ear before sliding off Rio’s lap. She gently lowers herself onto the floor on her knees. Rio thinks she looks stunning. Agatha is cupping and pushing into Rio’s bulge when she whispers, “Pants off.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifts her hips and helps Agatha take her sweats off. Agatha gives a surprised hum and says, “Commando?”</p><p> </p><p>“Figured it was easier,” Rio claims. It is totally not because her only clean underwear have cartoon characters on them and she doesn’t want Agatha to know she owned that type of clothing yet. That’s Rio’s <em> real </em> third base.</p><p> </p><p>“I like your attitude.” Agatha grasps Rio’s dick with one hand; it’s black and has an anatomically correct head. Agatha gives it a kiss. It’s chaste physically, but psychologically, it causes Rio’s clit to swell with blood. She can feel herself leaking onto her thighs. “Can you do something for me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” It’s barely a word.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds her hand out under Rio’s chin and beckons her fingers in a ‘hand it over’ motion. “Give me some help, please.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is so turned on it doesn’t take very long to gather enough saliva to spit into Agatha’s waiting palm. She has to use a little force so the girth of her spit doesn’t wane running down her chin. Also, that’d look embarrassing.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a good boy.” Agatha then spits into her palm, also, and their saliva mixes as Agatha begins to pump Rio’s dick slowly in a manner that its base grinds onto Rio’s clit. “I’ve got one more request for you, darling.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face is fully flustered. “Anything.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t hold back.” Agatha splays her hand on the base of Rio’s harness and takes Rio’s cock in her mouth. She licks a broad stripe on its length, bottom to top, before taking the first inch or two in her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>The image of Agatha hollowing out her cheeks to slowly fit Rio’s dick down her throat has Rio’s hands instinctively move towards Agatha’s hair to tug on it. Agatha gives a high-pitched groan at that, and when Rio starts stretching at Agatha’s scalp with her nails, Agatha works the cock deeper into her throat. Rio has no problem thrusting her hips to help her get her lips to touch the base of the harness. When this happens, Agatha lets out a lovely gagging noise.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio husks out, “you look so fucking hot like this. Quieter too, when your mouth is working for and not against me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at Rio, brows furrowed, but with the way her tears pricked from her eyes, which were smudged with mascara, she did not look very serious.</p><p> </p><p>It’s at this moment Rio realizes Agatha’s unused hand is between her legs and moving. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” Rio’s voice gets dangerous. “Are you <em> touching yourself</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth leaves Rio’s cock with a sickening pop, and thick saliva is dripping down her chin. “I can multitask.” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re deluded if you think you’re going to be the one making yourself come.” Rio grabs a fistful of Agatha’s hair and tugs up. “Get on the fucking couch.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets Rio push her to the sofa, where she sits down on the cushions.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so impatient you had to masturbate while blowing me?” Rio stands over Agatha. “Do you think I’ll be that awful at giving you an orgasm?”</p><p> </p><p>“I just wanted to feel good.” Agatha states it like it’s a fact instead of it being incredibly irritating.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm.” Now it’s Rio’s turn to kneel and spare a look at Agatha’s panties. There’s an obvious wet spot on the gusset now, and it’s spilling onto her thighs, as well as the parts of her pubic hair that aren’t hidden by the piece of clothing. “I wonder how sensitive you’d be now.” Rio presses her nose into Agatha’s covered sex, the bridge of her nose likely hitting where Agatha’s swollen clitoris would be. When she hears Agatha whine, she knows she’s hit the jackpot. She takes a deep inhale. “God, you smell so fucking good. Divine.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’d taste even better,” Agatha moans, and her hips buck to meet Rio’s slightly parted mouth. </p><p> </p><p>“Ugh. You’re too hot to tease right now.” Rio reaches for the waistband of Agatha’s panties, and Agatha preens, wetting her lips as she lets Rio take them off and leave her bare for Rio to devour. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio sees Agatha’s bare cunt, she groans. She uses her fingers to spread Agatha’s puffy, pink labia to watch as Agatha’s vagina tenses at the new, cold air, and likely because of Agatha knowing what’s about to come. Or who. Rio smirks internally at that thought, but physically, her jaw is still slack at the sight of Agatha’s legs spread for her.</p><p> </p><p>“As much as I like how you appreciate real art,” Agatha pants, “this is meant to be an interactive exhibit.” </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio gives a gentle kiss to Agatha’s jutted clit before licking, with a flat tongue, on her entrance. Agatha cries out unabashedly, tugging on Rio’s hair as if it’s what’s making Rio pick which direction to go in.</p><p> </p><p>“You <em> taste </em> so fucking good, too,” Rio mumbles against Agatha’s throbbing cunt before getting back to work. Agatha was tangy and worked up enough to have a little musk to her. Rio lapped up every bit of desire she could from Agatha, getting into the crevices of Agatha’s labia and clitoral hood to do so. She could feel Agatha’s whimpers vibrating against her sternum, could feel Agatha’s thighs trembling as they squeezed around Rio’s head, becoming her new favorite pair of earmuffs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio holds Agatha’s thighs apart so she can get her tongue deeper. She eats Agatha out like she’s trying to find something, and in a way, she is— she wants to find the thing that makes Agatha unravel beneath her, like pulling on a loose thread of a sweater until it’s completely undone. When Rio’s mouth inches up to suck lightly on Agatha’s clit, the younger woman yelps, her hips jumping.</p><p> </p><p>“Good, good, boy,” Agatha sighs. “You’ve got such a good work ethic, baby.” At Rio’s moan, Agatha laughs breathily. “God, if you had a tail you’d be wagging it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio responds to that by curling her tongue and pinning Agatha’s clit to the roof of her mouth, using just the right amount of suction and bobbing her head up and down in quick movements. Agatha actually screams at that, her hands roughly pushing the back of Rio’s head so get Rio’s mouth impossibly closer to her cunt as she’s surprised into an orgasm. Her hips involuntarily buck into Rio’s tongue and teeth.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio can tell Agatha is done, she lifts her face up, her chin drenched. “There we go… I think you’re ready to take me, now.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moves to get into a position where Rio can comfortably connect their hips. Before Rio lines herself up with Agatha’s entrance, she crushes her lips to Agatha’s, sticking her tongue in Agatha’s warm mouth. Agatha sucks her own juices off of Rio’s tongue, even going as far as to lick at the dip below Rio’s bottom lip to get more right as Rio breaks the quick, but intense, kiss. Rio swipes her cock across Agatha’s soaking cunt, gathering enough of Agatha’s orgasm to coat the dick before Rio slowly enters Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck,” Agatha sobs. When Rio eventually bottoms out, their faces are only a few inches from each other. Rio can barely see the electric blue in Agatha’s eyes, her pupils are so wide. </p><p> </p><p>“So open and ready for me,” Rio hums. She gives an experiential thrust, and Agatha’s hips roll up to meet Rio’s movement. “Feel good?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, yes.” Agatha’s head tilts back onto the arm of the couch, exposing her long neck, and her eyes flutter shut as she revels in the experience of getting filled. At this angle, Rio suddenly remembers Agatha has <em> pierced tits</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Lord, how could she have forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tugs on one of the barbells in Agatha’s nipple, and Agatha’s mouth opens in a silent scream. Rio tightly grips Agatha’s hips as she bends down to put one in her mouth at the same time she gives a particularly intense slam of her cock, and Agatha’s body bends to her will in a steadfast manner, her hands flying to Rio’s hair as Rio nibbles on Agatha’s hard, sensitive nipple.</p><p> </p><p>Rio plants hot kisses along Agatha’s chest, sternum, throat, and stops at her ear. “Got anything to say?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just grunts.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what I thought.” Rio nips at the shell of Agatha’s ear, and she can feel the goosebumps it causes, the shudder that takes over Agatha’s body. “All bark until you’ve got my cock inside you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha says, and Rio digs her palms into the couch so she can quicken her pace, causing Agatha to go back to voicing only a babble of moans and whimpers.</p><p> </p><p>The base of Rio’s cock digs into her clit well. One might argue <em> too </em> well, because her rhythm is staggering and her hips start to jerk at uneven movements.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t forget to come inside,” Agatha quips, and Rio groans, one of her hands moving to grasp Agatha’s jaw, squishing her cheeks together.</p><p> </p><p>“God himself could not pull me out of you, Agatha,” Rio admits, and soon enough her nose is in the crook of Agatha’s neck, smelling her sweat as Rio comes undone. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips roll lazily as Rio rides out her orgasm. “You bust in me so quick, baby. My pussy that powerful?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off,” Rio growls. “You <em> teased </em> me because you were too impatient to come on my dick.” At this, Rio gets an idea. She slides out of Agatha, who makes a very loud noise of protest. “Quiet. Turn around.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wets her lips as the understanding reaches her. Rio guides her to get up and bend over the arm of the sofa, and Rio is quick to insert herself back into Agatha’s cunt.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck.” Agatha’s face scrunches up in pleasure at the sensations the new angle brings her. “Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>The most beautiful way her name has been spoken, Rio thinks. She doesn’t take the time to get back to her normal pace; it’s where she starts, and by the way Agatha sounds, she’s enjoying it, too. Rio keeps one hand on Agatha’s hip, but her other one squeezes Agatha’s ass before ghosting its way up Agatha’s spine and, finally, brushing against Agatha’s rune.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s— <em> oh</em>.” Agatha drags out a long whine that only stutters out into a whimper because she presumably runs out of the air in her lungs to continue it. Rio moves her hand up to Agatha’s shoulder blades, where the tattoo is at its widest, and presses her palm into it, spreading her fingers. Agatha sobs. “That feels so good. Don’t stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Her words are too put together for Rio’s liking. Rio continues to hammer her cock into Agatha, but she leans forward, reaching over Agatha’s shoulder. When Agatha takes Rio’s hand and positions it around her throat, Rio hums.</p><p> </p><p>In Agatha’s ear, she says, “You think you can take it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” It’s barely loud enough for Rio to hear.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me hear you say it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can feel the hard swallow Agatha gives before she starts pleading. “Give it to me. I can take it. I can take it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t fuck Agatha faster, or harder. No, what she does is steady herself with the hand on Agatha’s throat and licks the design etched onto Agatha’s back. The wet scream Agatha responds with sounds like music to Rio’s eardrums. She traces the lines with her tongue, relishing in the way Agatha’s body quivering like a leaf below her.</p><p> </p><p>“I can feel you everywhere,” Agatha cries. And she’s actually crying, because Rio can feel tears trail down to Agatha’s neck, where Rio is holding onto her. When Rio kisses her inked shoulder blade, a powerful climax hits Agatha’s body like a train. She starts to ramble. “Don’t stop, don’t stop, don’t stop...”</p><p> </p><p>When Rio gathers enough tattooed skin in her mouth to take between her teeth and bite down, she feels Agatha squirt hard enough to spray the harness and her thighs. After that, the noises Rio draws out of Agatha become obscene from both ends. </p><p> </p><p>Rio slows when she sees, and feels, another orgasm wash over Agatha’s body. She pulls out, but as a little treat to herself, kneels and rubs three fingers over Agatha’s clit in wide circles, watching raptly as spurts of Agatha’s climax drench Rio’s palm and wrist. Ah, fuck it. She starts catching them with her mouth, eyes closing as she can feel the pressure of Agatha’s orgasm on her tongue, and Agatha whimpers. </p><p> </p><p>She stops when Agatha’s body stills. Rio walks over to Agatha and holds out her fingers. “Clean this up.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakily takes Rio’s fingers in her mouth and sucks, humming at her own taste. When Rio’s fingers have been tongued clean, Agatha continues to clean the rest of Rio’s hand, giving the heel of Rio’s palm a close-mouthed kiss to signal when she’s finished.</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl,” Rio praises, but there’s a teasing lilt to it. Agatha rolls her eyes and huffs. She’s still breathing a little heavily. “You know, not to do this in the opposite order, but… I really would like to take you out.”</p><p> </p><p>As Rio detaches the dildo from her harness, Agatha grins lazily at her like a cat who’s got the cream. “And where would you take me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably a simple but nice restaurant to start,” Rio admits. “Maybe an art museum. You seem like the type to enjoy that sort of thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows raise, but she nods. “You aren’t wrong. That sounds… decent.” She holds out her hand. “Give me my phone.”</p><p> </p><p>It takes Rio a second, but she finds Agatha’s phone on the kitchen counter. It has a purple case. Agatha unlocks it and says, “Text yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grins wickedly as she sends a quick <em> hey, it’s that dick you begged for </em> and when she passes the phone back to Agatha, Agatha does not look impressed at the greeting.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you free tonight?” Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip, grinning. “You’re going mighty quick.”</p><p> </p><p>“We just fucked on your couch.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, but there’s a glimmer in her eyes. “I don’t have anything that important, I suppose.”</p><p> </p><p>“You think you could be ready by six?” At Agatha’s nod, Rio smiles. “Don’t worry. I’ll take good care of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm.” Agatha stretches, and Rio appreciates the angles of her body it shows off. “I’m going to take a long, hot shower, and unfortunately, you cannot join me. But, I would like to see you all dressed up soon.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just for you.” Rio gives Agatha a suggestive kiss on her jawline before putting her clothes back on and heading out the door.</p><p> </p><p>When she gets home, Rio sees that Agatha’s old reviews have been deleted, and in their place, there’s a new and shiny five-star comment. </p><p> </p><p>★★★★★: <em>The employees here really care about giving you everything they have the ability to offer. They do it well, too, and will leave you fully satisfied. The owner of this establishment pays an incredible amount of attention to detail. I plan on using Rio Vidal for her services again.</em></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Something has been eating Rio’s flowers.</p><p> </p><p>Usually, this wouldn’t upset her. Creatures need to eat, and Rio, who is one of those creatures who eats herself, tends to be fairly forgiving. But the flowers being munched on aren’t just any flowers; they’re the ones she’d chosen as shoots to sprout just in time for her and Agatha’s two-month anniversary. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is spending one of her “work from home” afternoons reading some crime novel in Rio’s backyard hammock when she finally catches the petal-munching culprit. </p><p> </p><p>She picks up the caramel-and-cream colored rabbit by its scruff before showing it proudly to Agatha. “Look, I found the fucker eating my flowers!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up from her book and her eyes soften. Rio smiles back, but then Agatha says, “Oh, he’s so cute!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns at the realization that Agatha is, in fact, not making those eyes at her. “Agatha. Did you not hear? He was eating my flowers.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gracefully rolls out of the hammock (something Rio is still unable to comprehend, as she usually has to fall out) and makes grabby hands. “Lemme hold him.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sticks out her arm like she’s handing Agatha an object. She might as well be; however, Agatha coos when gingerly taking the bunny from Rio’s grasp, cradling him.</p><p> </p><p>“This is a wild animal,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at his ears!” Agatha pets them. “They’re floppy. That’s only true for domesticated bunnies, Rio. Oh, he needs a home.”</p><p> </p><p>“If he’s domesticated, he probably has a family, and is lost.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts. “To whatever family let him wander the wilderness by himself?”</p><p> </p><p>“We live in a suburb.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Agatha shakes her head, ignoring Rio’s comment, petting the bunny’s head. “Bunny redistribution system. He’s mine, now. Well, if he’s not microchipped.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s tone got whiny. “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Or, well, maybe I could bribe whatever vet I take him to…”</p><p> </p><p>“Not to spoil the surprise,” Rio interrupts, “but he was eating flowers I was planning to give you for our date tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes soften as she begins to understand Rio’s reason for being frustrated. “Well, think of Señor Scratchy as the gift, instead. And I love him very much already.”</p><p> </p><p>“Señor… Scratchy?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s his name,” Agatha explains, like it’s supposed to make any sort of sense. She gets closer to Rio, kisses her on the cheek. “If it’s okay with you… I would actually like to get some supplies for him and take him home.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pouts at that.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio. We’re still on for seven, right? I’ll even let you pick me up, if you’d like.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio straightens up at the thought of getting to be a little gentleman like that. Also, in the couple of months she’s dated Agatha, she has learned extremely quickly that woman needs to be behind the wheel as little as possible. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>When the time comes, Rio walks up to Agatha’s place wearing a simple white button down and some brown slacks. Her tie is plum-colored. Agatha greets her wearing a green slip dress, and Rio feels her mouth turn dry.</p><p> </p><p>“You look nice,” she manages to say. She peers behind Agatha. “No Scratchy?”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s cooped up in the bathroom. Getting used to a little at a time. <span>He’ll be good for the night.</span>” Agatha tugs on the end of Rio’s tie so she can come closer. “C’mere.”  </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes slip closed as they kiss. Agatha’s lips cup Rio’s gently before letting go. Agatha squints and rubs her nude-colored lipstick off of Rio’s lip with her thumb. “Where ya taking me, stud?”</p><p> </p><p>“Emilio’s,” Rio admits. </p><p> </p><p>“Wow, that’s a pretty nice place.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks. “You know I own my own business, correct? I’m not broke.”</p><p> </p><p>They’re seated at a corner booth, which makes it easier for Agatha to play footsie with Rio as their orders are taken.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands drum on the table. “Is it crazy to say it feels like it’s been longer than two months?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles into her glass of red wine. “Sounds like something a lesbian would say.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes and responds with, “You’re a lesbian, too, you know,” to which Agatha gasps dramatically at.</p><p> </p><p>The service is quick, and Rio is soon digging into her chicken parm. Agatha got something with veal in it. When she notices Agatha’s face is flushed during their meal, Rio asks, “Are you okay? Is it spicy?”</p><p> </p><p>“S’not spicy,” Agatha says, and her heel playfully kicks at Rio’s shin. “Don’t worry, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha acts oddly most of the meal. Rio talks, and Agatha is definitely listening, adding the appropriate commentary. But if Agatha is anything, she’s a big talker, and she’s been silent by Agatha standards.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio prods, “are you sure everything is okay? Is the food bad? Is there something I did?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, I’m fine, I promise,” Agatha says. “You didn’t do anything wrong, and the food is amazing. Seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is basically full and playing with her food when she notices a few things. First, Rio can only see one of Agatha’s hands as she eats and finishes her glass of wine. There’s a small bead of sweat resting on Agatha’s temple, not heavy enough to make its way down. And then it happens: Agatha whimpers quietly. Rio’s heart stops.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” she hisses. “Are you doing what I think you’re doing?”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you think I’m doing?” Agatha whispers, but by the way her voice slightly wavers, she’s doing exactly what Rio thinks.</p><p> </p><p>Rio quickly calls their waiter and wraps up their meal, only glancing at the check long enough to add fifty for a tip before dragging Agatha outside.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t fucking believe you,” Rio says, gripping Agatha’s wrist.</p><p> </p><p>Rio can see Agatha’s confidence wane for a second as she asks, “Are you… actually upset?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, fuck, I’m incredibly turned on.” Rio grabs Agatha’s offending hand and brings its fingers up to her nose. They smell like Agatha. “How long were you touching yourself, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“Um…” Agatha looks off to the side, as if she’s thinking. “Probably after the waiter brought our food, since I knew he wouldn’t be back for a while.”</p><p> </p><p>“How the hell did you manage to keep your composure for so long?”</p><p> </p><p>“I—” Agatha gasps and hums as Rio brings her fingers to her mouth, sucking. “I like to think I’m good at multitasking.”</p><p> </p><p>“Get in the car.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio still opens the door for Agatha, but she turns the key in her ignition with frustration. Because, for the record, if Rio had known earlier, she would’ve helped, or something. “So, you can’t even keep your hands off yourself for dinner?”</p><p> </p><p>“You look so good in that shirt,” is Agatha’s explanation. She starts lifting up the skirt of her dress, and Rio’s mind admittedly turns dirtier at the exposed skin. When Agatha digs her heels into the seat and spreads her legs, Rio can’t see how wet Agatha is— but she <em> can </em> smell it.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio groans, and she shifts her car into drive. “Agatha, do not touch yourself right now. I need to drive.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t give a worded answer; she only whines.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean it.” Rio’s voice drops an octave, turning rough. “Clasp your hands on the headrest or you can come on your own tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio has to pay attention to the road, but she can perfectly picture Agatha’s jutting bottom lip at that. What a little pouter. Rio hears some shuffling and takes a quick peek to see Agatha following her orders.</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl,” Rio praises, and her right hand lifts off the steering wheel to loosely cup Agatha’s bare thigh. The younger woman whimpers, especially as Rio’s hand travels up. Rio can’t help it. She brushes two gentle fingers against the meat of what Agatha’s lacy underwear is hiding. Warm, wet. Rio’s hand moves to grip her thigh as Agatha’s hips jump.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so mean.” Agatha’s breath hitches when Rio simply digs her nails into Agatha’s thigh. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t realize you were that wet,” Rio admits, a little stunned.</p><p> </p><p>“I was thinking about you.” Agatha sighs, and Rio can feel her squirm underneath her grasp. “And what you do to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is practically white-knuckling the wheel as she turns, one-handed but smoothly, into her neighborhood. “You’re so needy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha preens at this like it’s a compliment. “You’ll take care of me, I’m sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio abruptly parks and drags Agatha out of the car by her wrist. They’re still in the paved driveway when Agatha tries to shove her tongue down Rio’s throat. When Rio breaks the kiss and cups Agatha’s chin gently, Agatha glares. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to give my neighbors a show,” Rio murmurs in an implicit apology. “Your body is for my eyes only.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can tell Agatha has to fight to keep her eyes fluttering shut; her lips purse as she preens. Her smile becomes all teeth when Rio’s thumb brushes over Agatha’s painted bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio shuts the front door of her duplex, she turns around to slam Agatha against the wall beside it, but Agatha beats her to it. All of a sudden, Rio is the one pinned. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wraps her arms around Rio’s neck and tugs her in for a wet, dirty kiss. It doesn’t take long for Agatha’s hips to start grinding on one of Rio’s thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Not yet.” Rio straightens her leg, taking away Agatha’s friction. She whines in protest, and Rio just tuts. “With how naughty you were tonight? I have other plans.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns. “I told you why, though. I couldn’t help it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart, you definitely could.” Rio keeps herself at an angle that Agatha can’t grasp her, but her own hand ghosts Agatha’s waist. “You just didn’t want to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Why would I?”</p><p> </p><p>“Remember what you told me that first time?” At Agatha’s confused expression, Rio smirks. “That if I kept touching your rune, you’d come untouched.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips fall into a flat, unimpressed line when she realizes Rio’s implication. “Just because I can doesn’t mean I don’t want to.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t get much say tonight, princess.” Rio’s lips tilt to ghost the shell of Agatha’s ear when she whispers, “And trust me, by the time I’m done, you’ll want it so badly you’ll be begging for it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs at this. When Rio’s fingers brush her bare arms, she feels goosebumps.</p><p> </p><p>“I have a gift for you,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio’s fingers skirt over to the slit of Agatha’s dress that bares her thigh to Rio’s hungry eyes. “Why do I have a feeling it’s under this?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just grins as she turns around, taking her hair and moving it to uncover her back. “Unzip me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t have to be told twice, though she does put a little pressure on the teeth of the zipper so the metal grazes against the soft hairs of Agatha’s back. The slip dress is quickly pulled down by gravity, pooling at Agatha’s heeled feet. The shoes Agatha wears give her an inch or two on Rio, and honestly, it’s incredibly hot, the way Agatha turns her head around and her eyes are just a little higher than where Rio expects them to be.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn’t wearing a bra— Rio had already gathered this, by the way the dress had tiny straps and how, at dinner, Rio had seen Agatha’s nipples through her dress. But she did have on a lacy green thong and a matching garter belt, which somehow, Rio had missed while stroking her legs in the car.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck.” Rio’s throat is rapidly drying, and then Agatha turns around fully, and Rio’s throat immediately turns into a desert. She can immediately tell Agatha has new nipple jewelry in, because her usuals are barbells, and these are rings. And they’ve got little green gemstones on them, the same shade as her lingerie. “Jesus Christ, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you like it?” Agatha leans into Rio, now, and wraps her arms back around Rio’s neck. Rio can feel the warmth of Agatha’s bare body. </p><p> </p><p>“If I ever say anything else, take me out back and shoot me Old Yeller style.”</p><p> </p><p>“What a funny little guy.” Agatha tugs on Rio’s tie one-handed. “You’re wearing too many clothes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands hold a tight grip on Agatha’s naked hips as Agatha loosens Rio’s tie before unbuttoning the white button-down she has on. Rio’s left wearing her shirt like a jacket, uncovering her simple black tee-shirt bra. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha unbuckles Rio’s belt, she gives a nice little hum. “Black boxers. I see you went all out tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gives an irritated huff and bucks her hips into Agatha’s touch. “Don’t make your smart mouth get you in trouble tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’d fold like a lawn chair way too quickly, darling.” Agatha slides her hand into Rio’s boxers. “Oh, you’re so wet for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers feeling around her slit makes Rio feel like her body is on fire. She chokes out, “I want you on your knees.”</p><p> </p><p>“You <em> want</em>?” Agatha frames two fingers around Rio’s clit without touching it. Growling, Rio dips a hand just below Agatha’s lingerie to grab a fitful of pubic hair and pull. She smirks when Agatha squeals. Agatha then sighs dramatically, lifting up one of her heels to avoid making her dress a tripping hazard. “Well, I guess I was never bought dessert tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“And whose fault is that?” Rio’s hands make their way into Agatha’s hair as she kneels, taking off Rio’s pants and underwear on her journey down, helping Rio kick them off and leaving her bare at the crotch. She still has her socks and shoes on, but she’s too impatient to point that out. She’s fucking throbbing. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, baby.” Agatha spreads Rio’s lips with her damp fingers, barely gracing a fingertip to Rio’s protruding clit. “He’s so big and angry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well put ‘him’ in your fucking mouth,” Rio grunts out, and she tries to push Agatha’s head into her cunt, but Agatha keeps her position, looking up and raising an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“I give you two minutes tops,” Agatha says, and then traps Rio’s clit between her lips before letting her tongue explore Rio’s soaking slit.</p><p> </p><p>Rio throws her head back and shamelessly grinds onto Agatha’s chin. Agatha ends up being correct; it doesn’t take long for Rio’s thighs to start their telltale shaking as she gasps and orgasms straight into Agatha’s mouth. When Agatha’s done licking up its traces, she stands back up to lock her eyes with Rio’s, though not before giving Rio’s bra-clad nipple a bite. Rio moans. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t even think you lasted ninety seconds,” Agatha purrs, one of her hands lowering to brush Rio’s pubic bone with her thumb. Rio’s hips jump at the feeling. Agatha’s the perfect height to whisper in Rio’s ear without stretching her mouth up. “Poor thing. How long do you think it’d take me to make you come again, hmm?” Rio’s own hand holds Agatha by the small of her back, her fingertips coming into contact with Agatha’s tattoo. The younger woman’s breath hitches as her blunt nails dig into Rio’s pubes before her middle finger dips down and presses down onto Rio’s now-sensitive clit.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Rio holds Agatha closer to her.</p><p> </p><p>“Needy boy.” Agatha swipes her finger through Rio’s wet core before bringing it back up to Rio’s clit, flicking it nonchalantly. “I bet I could make you come with just this finger.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll make you come with no touch at all,” Rio grunts out, and Agatha’s finger stills. “Hey.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cups Rio’s chin, her finger giving just enough delicious pressure to keep Rio in her place. “I’d think twice before making that decision.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Rio smiles, an open-mouth pant. She can feel the warm flush of her cheeks. “You don’t think you’re capable of it?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watches as Agatha’s jaw clenches and grits her teeth as the cogs whir in her brain. Agatha’s finger leaves Rio’s cunt, and Rio does her best to appear unaffected. Next, Agatha cups Rio’s jaw and forces the finger she’d just had in Rio’s wetness in her mouth, and Rio takes it and sucks.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t even deserve that first pitiful orgasm I gave you,” Agatha mutters.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tongues Agatha’s finger clean and then learns forward, kissing Agatha on her jawline. “And why is that?” Rio grabs Agatha’s ass, practically bare in her current lingerie, and squeezes. “You know I’ll treat you right. Let me take you to bed.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs as Rio sucks a bruise onto her neck. “You’re very incorrigible, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Your </em> incorrigible.” Rio gives Agatha’s ass a playful smack, and before Agatha can smart off at it, Rio’s hand glides up to touch Agatha’s rune tattoo, which turns her response into a shiver. “Take off your heels, baby. I don’t want you to trip.”</p><p> </p><p>On their way to the bedroom, Rio shrugs off the rest of her clothing, kicks off her socks and shoes. Agatha still has on her garter belt and panties, and she lays her back on the bed, her hair surrounding her like a wavy brown halo. She’s panting. Rio’s mouth waters at the way Agatha’s flushed chest heaves, at the way her nipples strain in the air, as if they’re begging for Rio’s fingers to pluck at them. When Agatha spreads her thighs as Rio climbs on top of her, Rio can see a small wet spot on the gusset of Agatha’s underwear. Fuck.</p><p> </p><p>“Turn on your stomach, baby girl.” Rio guides Agatha’s body as she moves around, and then, ah, finally, Agatha’s back tattoo is at an angle for Rio to touch. Rio situates herself to straddle Agatha’s thighs. When Rio first caresses it by dragging her thumbs up Agatha’s back, Agatha moans. Her head is off to the side, not stuffed into some pillow, so it’s clear and rings in Rio’s ear like the crystal it is. “You’re so tense.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not. I bet you could put three fingers in me right now,” Agatha purrs, and she wiggles her hips and ass in hopes Rio will touch her where she needs it most.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice try.” Rio gives Agatha’s ass a small smack, which results in a whine. She lowers herself to kiss on Agatha’s spine, the space between her shoulder blades, a freckle. Rio’s hands smooth themselves up and down, up and down Agatha’s curves. Agatha writhes underneath her. It takes a minute or so for Rio to realize the movements are a little too measured to be involuntary, and they hover towards Agatha grinding onto the mattress. Rio clicks her tongue in a chastising manner. “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p> </p><p>“You aren’t subtle.”</p><p> </p><p>Hooded blue eyes lock onto Rio’s. “Dunno what you mean.”</p><p> </p><p>“Let me change things up, then.” Rio guides herself off of Agatha, who harrumphs. Rio scoots herself up and leans against the pillows and soft headboard of Agatha’s bed. “Come here.” When Agatha gets up and prepares to straddle her, Rio shakes her head. “No, turn around and lean back into me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hair is soft as Rio pushes it forward onto one of Agatha’s shoulders, so that Agatha’s bare back can press against Rio’s front. Both of them shiver. “And what are you going to do with me like this, exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you know what patience is, darling?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs, but doesn’t respond. Rio then says, “Give me your wrists,” and when Agatha does so, Rio lets a little spark of green magic shoot out of her so that a thick, ropelike vine can wrap and tie itself in knots around Agatha’s wrists. Agatha gasps. “<em>Rio</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Whether it’s surprise, a scolding, or lust, Rio doesn’t quite know. She puts two fingers under the ropes. “You good?” When Agatha nods shakily, Rio continues. “Bend your knees until your calves touch your thighs.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans as she moves her body to Rio’s words, as if she knows what’s coming. Rio’s next vine-ropes bind Agatha in the frog tie, wrapping around Agatha’s legs to keep them bent. When everything is said and done, Agatha’s body weight is balanced by leaning back into Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“See,” Rio says, “now you can’t grind your little cunt into orgasm.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so rude,” Agatha whines. She bucks her hips, but there’s no pressure to get relief in. She sighs, her nose touching feather-light on Rio’s sternum as she turns her head in frustration. </p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m extremely kind, actually.” As one of Rio’s hands rubs Agatha’s back, the other wraps around her waist, brushing over the hairs on Agatha’s stomach before making its way up to one of her nipples, giving it a little pinch. “See? I know how sensitive your nipples are. I could make you come by touching much harder areas.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps a hand on Agatha’s back while touching her so that Agatha’s senses are heightened. She starts with Agatha’s nipples, but soon moves down to her stomach, lightly scraping the pouch of Agatha’s lower stomach. Agatha squeaks when she pinches it, when Rio’s  hand goes even further down, tugging at her pubic hair. </p><p> </p><p>Rio moves her mouth at an angle that she can nibble on the shell of Agatha’s ear— and when Agatha realizes that’s what Rio’s doing, she moves her neck to give Rio more access and groans. Rio hums. “That’s it, princess. Let me hear you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha draws out her whines, lets them rest in the air as Rio uses both of her hands, now, to grip at Agatha’s thighs, to drag her fingertips over the soft, dimpled skin. It’s at the moment Rio decides to take the lace of Agatha’s panties and pull until she hears a rip.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio!</em>” Okay, now Rio <em> really </em>cannot tell if Agatha is frustrated or turned on. Hopefully a little bit of both. Rio tears until she can take it off, not only leaving Agatha only in her garter belt, but opening her cunt to the open air. Compared to the heat Agatha had been building between the barriers of her pussy and lingerie, the bedroom must be a shock, and Agatha rolls her head back at the chill. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s a little disappointed she can’t see the state of Agatha’s cunt. She can surely imagine it: bright pink, wet, probably pulsing to the same rhythm as Agatha’s racing heart. Rio moves her hands to get under Agatha’s thighs, cupping what she can of Agatha’s ass and digging into the cheeks. She hums when she realizes the backs of Agatha’s thighs, as well as the bedsheets under where Agatha is sitting, are a bit sticky.</p><p> </p><p>“So wet you’re leaking onto the sheets, and you can’t do anything about it.” Rio’s hands quickly move to hover over the other way again as she lets her thumbs brush over each of Agatha’s labia majora, though she refrains from touching and of the most sensitive parts. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s all for you,” Agatha croaks out. Her voice sounds prickly. “It’s yours, baby. This pussy is yours. Don’t you want to see how open and warm she is for you?” She lets a whimper escape. “Please.”</p><p> </p><p>“What manners.” As Rio keeps one hand on Agatha’s crotch and the other moves up to softly cup Agatha’s throat, she realizes the reason for the roughness behind Agatha’s voice. There are tears streaming down her face. “Oh, kitten, you’re so mad you’re crying, aren’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can feel Agatha’s jaw tense as she grits out, “Fuck you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re sooooo cute.” Rio tilts Agatha’s head so they can lock eyes. Agatha’s expression is a briney typhoon, the kind of ocean where mythical monsters lurk underneath. Rio shoots her a leviathan grin. “I’ll touch you once you come, sweetheart. But if you can’t handle it, just tell me. Tell me you can’t come untouched, and that I’m only edging you. I don’t want to be cruel.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat bobs under Rio’s grip, and she says nothing. But, she does moan when Rio leans in and licks the tears right off of her cheek, eyes squeezing shut. </p><p> </p><p>Rio changes strategy after this, keeping one hand scraping nails up and down Agatha’s back as she massages one thigh at a time. Rio enjoys the feel of Agatha’s plush skin underneath her fingertips, enjoys how she can just dig into Agatha’s flesh and grip a good amount of it at a time. Agatha cries at the touch, both from the cavern of her panting mouth and her eyes, and her head leans back for long enough that when Rio kisses her temple and neck, it’s a little salty. Though, that could also be from sweat. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio moves her hand on Agatha’s thigh to start kneading her breast and fiddling with the piercing adorning Agatha’s nipple, Agatha inhales in a sharp gasp. “Rio, I… I’m close.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio positions her arm in a way so that her forearm and brush against Agatha’s other nipple as she continues to pinch. She builds a lob of spit in her mouth and sets it softly on the crook of Agatha’s neck so it can slide down Agatha’s back, giving her some delicious sensations along with the massages Rio’s other hand is already giving her. Rio moves to lick the hard edge of Agatha’s ear and whisper in it, “You’ve got it, kitten. Let go.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sobs. “Fuck, just like that.” When Rio’s nails simultaneously dig into Agatha’s nipple and down her back, Agatha screeches as her body seizes up. Rio keeps one hand on Agatha’s back, but she lets the other wander down to scoop Agatha’s thigh so her legs can stay spread as she climaxes. Agatha’s never one to orgasm quietly, but she’s especially loud in this one. Rio moans as she realizes her own thighs are becoming damp. She reaches down and realizes Agatha’s squirted. </p><p> </p><p>“Good girl. You did such a good job.” Rio kisses Agatha’s temple. “Let me help you.” And then she takes her hand off Agatha’s thigh to rub three fingers right over Agatha’s clit.</p><p> </p><p>After having spent the last twenty minutes or so with no contact on her cunt whatsoever, the sudden pressure must be like a volcano erupting. Agatha screams as another orgasm rips through her and practically interrupts her first one. Rio can hear the way Agatha’s cunt gushes her climax out.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s it, baby girl. Ride it out.” Rio lowers her intensity, just letting her thumb brush Agatha’s clit as Agatha’s hips buck with intensity. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha gasps. “Rio, please, I’m so empty.” Rio feels a simmer in her lower stomach. “God, please, fuck me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio growls and practically pushes Agatha off of her, positioning her to lie face down, ass up on the bed. When she realizes Agatha’s legs are still tied, she puts her fingers under the rope and with her magic, easily cuts them off. She keeps the ones behind Agatha’s back, though; it’s a nice look. Agatha scoots forward and  brings up her shaky legs so she can show Rio her dripping cunt.</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl.” Rio smacks Agatha’s ass. “Didn’t even have to tell you.” She’s about to harness up when she realizes her harness and cock are sitting, cleaned, on Agatha’s bathroom counter. “Um.”</p><p> </p><p>“Baby,” Agatha whimpers. “Don’t tease.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I left my cock at your place.”</p><p> </p><p>“You what?” Oh, this is what Agatha sounds like genuinely frustrated. “Do you only have one?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would I need multiple?” Rio asks. “You like that one!” An idea forms. “Give me a second.”</p><p> </p><p>“One,” Agatha growls.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head and concentrates; she hasn’t exactly done this before. She conjures up a thick vine— a softer one than what she created for Agatha’s bindings, one that won’t crack or splinter, but hard enough to, well, get the job done. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you creating a dick out of <em> plants</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you complaining?” The cock sits on Rio nicely; she’s got it wrapped around her with some smaller vines like a traditional harness. She tugs on it experimentally, and it feels just as pliant but tough as her normal silicone. </p><p> </p><p>“No.” Agatha shakes her ass. “Hurry up.”</p><p> </p><p>When Rio guides herself inside Agatha, Agatha whines. Rio sees her fists clenching against the ropes tying them behind her back. “Does that feel good?”</p><p> </p><p>“Feels so fucking good,” Agatha mumbles, her hips slamming back to meet Rio’s thrusts. “Harder.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs onto the meat of Agatha’s hips as she slams her cock into Agatha. The equipment she’d made rubs against her clit in a way that has Rio grunting into every thrust. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face is squished into the mattress as she whimpers, her hair a mess around her. Rio takes a fistful of it and twists it around her hand before pulling Agatha up. The younger woman moans in surprise as Rio leans down to whisper in her ear, “Tell me, Agatha, whose pussy is this?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yours,” Agatha sobs.</p><p> </p><p>“Full sentences, princess.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heaves out, “It’s yours, this pussy is yours, fuck! Fucking take it. Claim me. Come inside me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio moans. Her grip on Agatha’s hair tightens. </p><p> </p><p>“C’mon, pretty boy. Come in me like you mean it.” Agatha pants as Rio’s thrusts grow deeper, more frantic. “S’your pussy, right, baby? Do whatever you want with her. Treat her like she’s yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand leaves Agatha’s hair and snakes around her chest, pulling her back and melding their bodies as flush as they can be with Agatha’s hands bound behind her back. Rio’s hand at Agatha’s waist dips down just a little so she can flick her middle finger across Agatha’s swollen clitoris.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby,” Agatha cries, and Rio feels a gush of liquid hit her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio grunts, “I’m gonna come inside you. I’m close.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fucking <em> do it</em>, then!” Agatha growls, and Rio can feel her flexing her hands against the rope. “I swear to god, I want to feel your cock pumping your orgasm into me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s dirty talking and the stimulation on Rio’s clit becomes overwhelming as Rio feels her legs start to shake. “Coming, baby, I’m coming.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes squeeze shut as her hips thrust frantically, without any sort of rhythm. She feels her cunt convulsing as she hurls into her climax, and Agatha squeals. “I can feel you,” Agatha says, and Rio moans as her hips still, but her orgasm continues. Rio buries her nose into the crook of Agatha’s neck and whimpers, inhaling and smelling Agatha’s sweat. She smelled so fucking good. Would it be weird for Rio to ask Agatha to shower less often so she could smell like this?</p><p> </p><p>When Rio feels herself coming back to reality, she cuts off the binds of Agatha’s wrists with the same magical ease as last time and slowly exits her cock out of Agatha, who grunts at the sudden empty feeling.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby,” Agatha pants. “I felt you come inside me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, that’s hot and all, but my orgasm is done,” Rio says. “You don’t have to keep up the illusion.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not kidding, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks down, curious, and sees a semi-transparent white liquid seeping out of her cock. Curious, she dips a finger in it and brings it to her tongue. It tastes like her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Rio muses.</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“You told me to come inside. I said I would… the magic filled in the gaps.” Rio realizes something. “Agatha, push it out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Push what out?”</p><p> </p><p>“My come.” Rio kneels, her heels hitting the headboard as she backs up, and spreads the lips of Agatha’s cunt. “I wanna see you creampie for me, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans at the realization and starts contracting and pushing the walls of her cunt. Rio helps her a little by gently stroking Agatha’s clit with her thumb, which makes Agatha whine. And then, oh, something that definitely isn’t Agatha’s own come or discharge starts to leak out in an obscene squelching sound. </p><p> </p><p>“What an obedient girl.” And before Agatha can mouth off, Rio dives in and swipes her tongue up the meat of Agatha’s cunt and into her entrance. Agatha groans and, now with her arms free, brings on back to messily grab at Rio’s hair. Agatha’s cunt tastes like the both of them, and, fuck, Rio is hooked. She cleans Agatha up, and if her thumb plays with Agatha’s clit a little and her girl gets another orgasm out of it, well, that’s just the way the cookie crumbles. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio can’t taste the two of them any longer, she lifts herself up. “I’ll let you taste next time. Couldn’t help myself.”</p><p> </p><p>“Next time?” Agatha turns around and lays on her back. “Hmmm.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes off her harness and throws it next to the other pieces of vine. She knows from experience they’ll be pretty shriveled up by the morning, and she’ll toss them in the compost she has set up in the backyard. When she notices Agatha’s wearing a contemplative expression, Rio asks, “What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m kinda hungry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well, you were too busy jerking off to eat your full meal.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pouts. “And then I had a workout!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, stretching. She relishes in the way Agatha watches her body while she does it. “What are you thinking?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha taps a finger on her cupid’s bow. “Milkshakes?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Let’s put on some clothes and we can go.” When they’d first started dating, Agatha had used a lot of delivery apps to order food in, but Rio didn’t see the point in it; Rio had no problem driving Agatha around. “Also, one more thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at Rio. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Happy two months. Obviously.” They share a sweet kiss.</p>

<p>Rio doesn’t think Agatha likes to go grocery shopping with her.</p><p> </p><p>They’ve been together a little over six months; they’re playing that game where Rio has a drawer of her clothes in Agatha’s dresser, and they cook most of their meals together, but Rio still technically has her apartment because she has the lease for another two months.</p><p> </p><p>But every time Rio goes grocery shopping with Agatha, she gets cranky. Rio is trying to figure out why. Before Agatha, Rio would grocery shop with noise cancelling headphones to make the event a little less overwhelming, but she found that Agatha still disliked it even when Rio took her in the early morning when it was at its emptiest. She’d tried going to slightly nicer places, but Agatha still had that little twitch in her brow when they’d get home.</p><p> </p><p>Every time, Rio would ask, “Are you okay? You seem upset.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not upset,” Agatha would say, upsetly. </p><p> </p><p>Last time, she’d asked Agatha if she just wanted Rio to go by herself, but Agatha was adamantly against it. So Rio was stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p> </p><p>Today is Wednesday afternoon. Rio had finished her job at Mrs. Hart’s early, and Agatha decided to take a half day because she hadn’t heard back about her edits on her current architectural project, so they decide to grab the list and go. </p><p> </p><p>“We need asparagus,” Rio comments, basket in hand, but Agatha is too busy glaring over the pile of organic produce to hear here. Rio purses her lips. “How about we get some eggplant, too?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fine,” Agatha responds, and now Rio knows she’s not paying attention, because Agatha hates eggplant. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” Rio puts her hand on her girlfriend’s shoulder, and the younger woman whips around to stare at her. “What’s up? Seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s nothing,” Agatha says, and Rio narrows her eyes, suspicious. She follows the direction Agatha is looking in and all she can see is Margaret Carter, one of the elderly ladies she mows once a week for, rifling through cantaloupe.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re glaring at Margaret,” Rio notes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pouts. “Oh, so it’s Margaret now.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what she told me to call her.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure she did,” Agatha mutters.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” Rio tries to keep any obvious chastisement out of her voice. “What do you have against Margaret?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha protests.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!” Margaret’s voice carries across the produce aisle. She’s wearing one of those floral old lady blazers like she’d just gone to church. “I haven’t seen you shop here before.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs a little nervously. “Well, we’re here every week.”</p><p> </p><p>“You look very nice in that shirt,” Margaret comments. “It fits you well.”</p><p> </p><p>“I like to make sure clothes fit me before I buy them,” Rio says genuinely.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I was thinking about the hydrangea placement for the wraparound porch—”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha interrupts, absolutely not sorry in the slightest, “but Rio has been working very hard on having a healthy work life balance, and this is throwing off the training we’ve put a lot of effort into. We’re going to continue shopping.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls Rio by the sleeve of her admittedly tight-fitting white tee shirt and leads her to the seafood.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whines, embarrassment creeping up her neck. </p><p> </p><p>“She was flirting with you,” Agatha says. “She literally wants you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs. “I’m young enough to be her granddaughter.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure that’s what Sarah Paulson told her ex before Holland Taylor.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sucks on her teeth, trying to not let too much frustration seep out of her. “Agatha. You don’t seriously think I’d treat you like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha answers immediately. “It was a bit impulsive.” She bites her cheek at the next admission. “Also, I thought it was kind of funny.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you told a falsehood about our relationship dynamic for… humor.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry!” Agatha snaps, and she crosses her arms. “But it’s really fucking frustrating to see at least one of your customers flirt with you every time we’re here. I have to cope somehow.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is that why you hate grocery shopping?” Rio asks, and she takes Agatha’s silence as a confirmation. “Why didn’t you say anything? I kind of see them sizing me up like their cute grandsons. And I only have eyes for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chews on her lip and looks at some random boxes of cereal packed onto the shelves beside them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio uses her free arm to cradle the back of Agatha’s head, fingers gripping on the hair tie she has holding her mane up to let it down. Agatha wears a confused expression as Rio sets their basket of goods down to put her own hair in an improvised, low-hanging bun.</p><p> </p><p>“Come here,” Rio whispers conspiratorially. When Agatha’s close enough, Rio pulls Agatha’s face to land in the crook of her neck. She says, “Suck there.”</p><p> </p><p>“Like a hickey?” Agatha murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>“Like a claim.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums and sinks her teeth into Rio’s neck. Rio sighs, her nails lightly scraping against Agatha’s scalp. When Agatha is done, she takes a step back and admires her work before picking up the basket at Rio’s trembling feet.</p><p> </p><p>“We need eggs,” is what Rio says next.</p><p> </p><p>They’re mostly silent, going through the list and staying on the topic of food until they’re halfway home, bags of food secured in the trunk of Rio’s Subie. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha breaks the silence. “I had an ex. We dated for three years, and she cheated on me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps her eyes on the road, but they soften. “I’m sorry, baby.” </p><p> </p><p>She can tell through her peripherals that Agatha just shrugs and looks out the window.</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t do that,” Rio states, her voice hard. “I’d never.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a beat of silence, and then Agatha softly replies with, “I know.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s Agatha’s house they go to, of course, but it’s slowly becoming bits and pieces of both of theirs. Rio’s plants on the balcony, Rio’s socks in the washing machine, Rio’s favorite spoons she’d nicked from her apartment resting in Agatha’s drawer. A few weeks ago, Rio had even shyly asked Agatha if she could get the pet she’d been wanting since she was a child, and so in the corner of Agatha’s office, Syrax the bearded dragon snoozed on her artificially heated rock while Scratchy would nap in the naturally heated windowsill next to her enclosure. </p><p> </p><p>“They’re friends,” Rio had said last week, and Agatha had rolled her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think Scratchy knows she exists, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had shaken her head. “That’s not true. Sometimes I’ll hold him up to her enclosure so they can look at each other.”</p><p> </p><p>Right now, they put the groceries away, and Rio watches Agatha bend over to put things in the sealed drawers of her fridge.</p><p> </p><p>“I can feel your eyes on my ass,” Agatha says, not even looking up from her position. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio replies innocently. “It’s a nice ass.”</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha gets up, Rio gently grabs her wrist to pull her into her grip. Hands on Agatha’s hips, Rio starts with, “You’re mine and I’m yours, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Agatha repeats. “I just… get so in my head. I hate seeing so many women be nice to you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want them to be mean to me? I thought that was your job.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wets her lip and smacks Rio on the arm. “You know I didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Baby, I don’t even notice other women when I’m around you.” Rio not-so-subtly slips a hand up Agatha’s shirt. “I have, like, horse blinders on. And you’re the one holding the reins.”</p><p> </p><p>“Kinky.” Agatha tosses her hair back as Rio’s calloused, but smooth, hand works its way up Agatha’s torso until Rio’s fingers dance right under the wire of her bra. “I’m not done putting away the groceries yet.”</p><p> </p><p>“But you’re done with the perishables.” Rio tugs Agatha in closer to her and nuzzles her neck. “Do you want help getting out of your head?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha answers by pulling on the bun of Rio’s hair until Rio looks up. When she does so, Agatha pulls her into a kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hasn’t gotten tired of kissing Agatha in the six months they’ve been dating, and she certainly isn’t going to anytime soon. Rio loves the way Agatha’s spit tastes in her mouth, would find a way to sustain herself on it if she could make those sort of changes to her body. She cups Agatha’s jaw in one hand and continues to mess with Agatha’s bra in the other, slipping her fingers under to put pressure onto the underside of Agatha’s left breast.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs into their kiss, giving a smile as she reaches up and behind her own shirt to undo the clasps. When it’s done, Rio doesn’t take the bra off, just uses the fact that Agatha’s bra has been loosened to fit her full hand under and give a good squeeze. She pinches a nipple, rolling Agatha’s piercing between her fingers. Agatha gasps against Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Bed,” Agatha whispers, so Rio does the sensible thing: she picks Agatha up by her bottom and rests her on her hips. Agatha yelps as she’s practically vaulted into the air and she wraps her legs around Rio’s torso, locking her ankles.</p><p> </p><p>Rio uses some of the weight training she’d been incorporating into her gym time lately to throw Agatha on the bed, and she cackles a little maniacally as Agatha screams. “Oops.” There’s no guilt in Rio’s tone. “Maybe I shouldn’t do that again.”</p><p> </p><p>“You better,” Agatha threatens, her eyes turning a little glassy. Rio tugs her tee over her head, showing that she’d forgone a bra in the grocery store.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve got to stop hard-nipping it in public,” Agatha states. “I don’t want other people seeing that.”</p><p> </p><p>“So I should stop the braless look?” Rio straddles Agatha’s thighs as she helps Agatha out of her shirt and bra.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm, wait. I definitely don’t want that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re giving mixed signals here, baby.” At Rio’s teasing, Agatha sits up and grabs Rio by the hips, taking one of Rio’s breasts into her mouth and giving a hard bite. “Ow, Agatha!” Rio rips Agatha’s little fangs away and inspects the damage. “I can literally see your teeth marks.” Agatha responds by flicking her fingers over both of Rio’s nipples at the same time. The touch has Rio’s body pushing itself towards Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>And then Agatha takes a hand and rips her own hair tie out of Rio’s hair so that it can tumble down and brush just past her shoulders. Agatha rakes her nails through Rio’s hair while toying with a nipple.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, tossing her head back. “A girl could get addicted to this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins in a shark-like manner, pulling Rio’s hair to put her attention back on herself, which is what Agatha figures she deserves. And then she puffs out her chest, her supple breasts molding into a shape that Rio finds herself drooling at. “These nipples aren’t going to suck themselves, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio, the multitalented queen she is (though Agatha would probably argue she’s more the court jester), is able to lather and flick her tongue on Agatha’s nipples, relish in the moans and mewls Agatha gives her, and also shuck her and Agatha’s pants off, kicking at them until they’re off the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re always so responsive to me,” Rio murmurs, teeth holding one nipple and fingers holding another.</p><p> </p><p>“You know my body well,” Agatha admits, and her cheeks color when she realizes how emotionally vulnerable that statement is. So she switches gears. “I feel empty.”</p><p> </p><p>“You would do just about anything for my cock inside you, wouldn’t you, sweetheart?” Rio takes two fingers and brushes them flatly against Agatha’s panties. Popping Agatha’s nipple from her mouth and blowing on it, she then glances down. The panties have got Snoopy on them. Agatha is so cute.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is panting heavily, but she’s able to nod.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks. Go time. “Great.” She sits up on her knees, taking herself off of Agatha, who whines at the loss of heat and touch. “Get out of bed.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes look half-glazed over, like sea glass. “Huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Get out of the bed,” Rio repeats, before adding, “and get on your knees.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sharpens a little bit at that. “Excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gets off the bed herself, rifling through the nightstand to collect the correct equipment. “You want my dick, no?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watches as Agatha sucks on her teeth, presumably contemplating. Rio situates the harness on herself, sliding Agatha’s favorite through the O-ring and tightening the straps on her thighs. She grins smugly as Agatha clambers off the bed and settles on her knees on the carpet.</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl,” Rio praises, and she can tell Agatha tries to hide the shudder that courses through her body at those words. She walks over to Agatha and grazes her thumb over Agatha’s bottom lip before commanding, “Let me see you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits a little straighter, and she puts her hands behind her back so she can show off her chest. Rio’s mouth waters as she gets to fully see how prettily Agatha’s breasts sit, her piercings practically staring at Rio. Agatha kept the ones with the green gemstones in after that night. Rio really likes that.</p><p> </p><p>Cupping Agatha’s jaw, Rio takes her silicone cock and holds it against Agatha’s face as if she’s taking a measurement. She lightly taps the head against the hollow of Agatha’s cheek, humming in satisfaction as Agatha whimpers. </p><p> </p><p>“Kiss it,” Rio murmurs, and Agatha takes Rio’s cock by the base to give the tip a kiss before licking it. She starts to take the cock in her mouth when Rio’s hand quickly moves from Agatha’s jaw to tug at her hair, forcing Agatha to take Rio’s strap out of her mouth. A line of drool drips embarrassingly down Agatha’s chin. Rio tuts. “Not too eager. I only said to kiss it.” At Agatha’s irritated pout, Rio chuckles. “I know you’re a whore who likes dick in your mouth, but you need to follow my instructions.”</p><p> </p><p>“You asking me to blow you now so you don’t bust two pumps in?” Agatha mouths off.</p><p> </p><p>Rio light slaps Agatha’s cheek, and her brow furrows when Agatha just rolls her eyes. “If you want to be such a brat about it, maybe I’ll rethink giving you a reward after sucking me off properly.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha perks up at the mention of a treat, a naughty dog. “Reward?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll find out what it is later,” Rio says. When Agatha juts out her bottom lip even further, Rio sighs and specifies. “Do you really think I’d call something a reward if I thought you wouldn’t enjoy it? Practice some patience.”</p><p> </p><p>“Never heard of her,” Agatha quips.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, who still has her hand in Agatha’s hair, pushes Agatha’s head back so her neck is exposed. “I think I need to see my cock bulging out of this throat, don’t you think?” At Agatha’s wanton moan, Rio smiles. “Right, so you can be obedient for me and not talk so smartly, hmm? I’m sure we can think of a better way to use your mouth.” When Agatha grins, open-mouthed, and looks at her with a playful sparkle in her eye, Rio reminds her, “Think of your reward.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoots closer to Rio, and Rio takes it as an invitation to take her cock and press it up against Agatha’s projecting bottom lip. Rio loudly moans. “Fuck, you got perfect cock-sucking lips.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s impossible to tell what happens first: Agatha’s lips enveloping Rio’s dick, or Rio cradling the back of Agatha’s head and pushing her dick into Agatha’s waiting, salivating mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tries to start off slow, but Agatha loves making a show of sucking Rio’s cock. Bobbing her head up and down, moaning as Rio’s cock goes from scraping her hard palette to bumping the back of her throat. At Agatha’s first real gag, Rio thrusts her hips into Agatha’s mouth. Her pace starts to become a bit harsh, but she knows that if it becomes too much for Agatha, she’ll tap Rio’s thigh three times.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes her hand and splays it across the base of the harness, making the base of the dildo grinding against Rio’s clit feel that much sweeter. If she imagines it hard enough, she can feel Agatha’s warm mouth full of her cock, the spasming of Agatha’s throat as she lets out a wet choking sound. Rio slides a hand down the gently cup Agatha’s throat, thumb on where Agatha’s esophagus turns into her sternum, so that when Agatha’s nose brushes Rio’s pubic hair, Rio can feel the shape of Agatha’s throat mold to her appendage. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s it, sweetheart, let me use you.” Rio tightens her grip on Agatha’s hair, and she must feel it, because she groans in pleasure. “Let me come and don’t waste a drop, hmm? Spitters are quitters.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs indignantly, but it sounds silly because there’s a dick in her mouth. Rio chuckles at that. Agatha’s sighs turn to more gags as Rio brings back her pace of straight up fucking Agatha’s face, and Rio can tell by the way her clit is deliciously bumping against the harness that Agatha is meeting Rio where she is, practically pushing her face into Rio’s cock to get it down that much further into her throat. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck.” Rio lets out a whimper. “I’m close.”  She moves to cradle Agatha’s head and shamelessly rut into her girlfriend’s mouth. “Fuck, you’re so good at this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gurgles as her nails dig into the back of Rio’s tensing thighs. Rio’s orgasm crashes over her exactly like this: a fucking rocket ship blasting off. Agatha’s nose presses into Rio’s harnessed pubic bone like she’s taking Rio’s orgasm for herself, and it makes Rio wonder if she’s even able to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s legs are a little wobbly when she feels her orgasm receding. Agatha slowly pulls Rio’s cock out of her mouth, and Rio watches her, at the very end, hollow her cheeks and make a dramatic sucking noise at the head of the dildo like she’s savoring every last bit of Rio’s climax. </p><p> </p><p>“Get on the bed,” Rio growls.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as Agatha’s back hits the high thread count bed sheets, her legs instinctively spread as Rio crawls to get in between them. Agatha still has her Snoopy-patterned panties on, and when Rio looks down, she notices a wet spot forming on them.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw,” Rio says. “Snoopy’s drowning.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha is squirming. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio originally planned on ripping Agatha’s panties off and fucking her instantly and senseless; she really did. But she finds herself crawling down, feeling the push of her dildo dragging down the bed as she hooks her fingers around the waistband of Agatha’s underwear and pulls it down so Rio can get the full smell of Agatha’s arousal. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a, “Fuck,” and it’s probably both of them. Rio plants a hot kiss on Agatha’s stomach, on the trail of hair that starts thin at her belly button and thickens into her bush. She gives that a kiss, too. </p><p> </p><p>“Baby.” Agatha’s voice is a full whine now. “Baby, put your mouth on me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio ignores her, parting Agatha’s swollen lips with her fingers. She’s not touching Agatha’s most sensitive bits, but her fingertips can already feel the sweltering heat radiating off of Agatha’s pleading cunt. </p><p> </p><p>“I need this tattooed on my eyelids,” Rio murmurs. It makes Agatha grumble.</p><p> </p><p>“I get it, I have a very pretty pussy, but you are driving me fucking crazy. Stop waxing on about my cunt and <em> eat it</em>.” Agatha’s hands gather the bedsheets and clench them in frustration.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath grows heavy. “Agatha, look at me.” When Agatha peers down at her, Rio shakes her head subtly. “No, actually look me in the eye.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha props herself up on her elbows, keeping her hips level. Rio has decided her eyes look like the perfect marriage between blue and green.</p><p> </p><p>“How could you ever think I would want anything else but this?” Rio asks. Still looking Agatha in the eye, she gives a soft, closed-mouth kiss to Agatha’s clitoris. “Why would I want anyone else when I have you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whimpers. The way Rio’s lips move to form her words are so close to Agatha’s lower lips she can feel them brush against her, and Rio watches as Agatha’s body clenches in anticipation. </p><p> </p><p>Rio hooks her arms under Agatha’s thighs so she can hold her still. She kisses Agatha again, lower, on the meat of her cunt so that when she pulls her lips back to speak, she can taste Agatha’s dripping desire on them. “This is mine.” When Agatha nods fervently, she continues. “You’re mine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says breathlessly. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t take your eyes off of me,” Rio orders, and then her tongue peeks out and she continues to stare Agatha straight in the eye as she licks a line from Agatha’s entrance to her throbbing clit.</p><p> </p><p>Eating pussy is already an intimate act for obvious reasons, but the way Rio gently laps up the pre-come dripping from Agatha while looking at her sea-colored eyes feels much more powerful— impossibly and incredibly closer. Rio gets to watch Agatha’s face heat up in real time; her cheeks are so pretty when they’re dusted in pink. A bead of sweat collects on her temple. Agatha flits between worrying her lip between her teeth and staring at Rio open-mouthed. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio softly grasps Agatha’s slippery-wet clit between her lips, Agatha instinctively throws her head back and her hips raise to push Rio’s face further into her pussy. But Rio tsks, pulling back just enough to say, “I said to not take your eyes off of me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, come back,” Agatha babbles. Her head shoots back up as her wild eyes find Rio’s again, the blush on her face creeping down to her neck and sternum. When Rio gives Agatha’s clenching entrance a chaste kiss, Agatha’s tongue wets her lips and she asks, “Could you add a finger or two?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm.” Rio takes one of her hands off of Agatha’s thigh and slips it under her chin, sliding two fingers into Agatha. Agatha sighs in relief as her cunt is finally allowed to squeeze and grip onto something. Rio gives slow licks on the meat of Agatha’s pussy, the tip of her tongue brushing her gently pumping fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so obedient.” Agatha takes a moment to brush a stray hair out of Rio’s face, but quickly balances herself on both of her forearms so she can watch Rio eat her out properly. “Like my little pet.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth leaves Agatha’s cunt just long enough to say, “I quite enjoy the tug of the leash,” and then she gets back to work.</p><p> </p><p>Rio can tell when Agatha’s orgasm starts to truly build: not just from the way Agatha’s walls try to cut off the circulation of Rio’s fingers, tightly pulling her in with every push Rio gives, but Agatha’s eyes start to squint as she tries not to close them for longer than a blink. Small tears prick the corner of her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve got it,” Rio croons, and by the way Agatha’s breath stutters, Rio knows she was able to hear it. Rio starts to curl her fingers, focusing on pumping in and out less and more on stroking the soft, ridged wall of Agatha’s g-spot, and puts a little teeth into sucking Agatha’s clit in a way that Rio knows drives her mad. Rio smirks against the pulsing, sensitive bud when Agatha cries out, hips jolting up. Rio quickly takes her free forearm and sets it across Agatha’s stomach, doubling her efforts. She drags her fingertips across Agatha’s g-spot every time she curls her fingers in, and that’s when she gets her prize. Agatha looks Rio straight in the eye, mouth agape in ecstasy as she reaches her climax. Rio can practically see the stars exploding behind Agatha’s expression.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t keep her mouth and fingers on Agatha during her aftershocks for too long, sitting up. When Agatha lets out a little pouting whine at that, Rio asks, “Don’t you want your reward?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods. So Rio goes back into the nightstand, rummaging around until she finds the small butt plug she knows Agatha likes. When she holds it up for Agatha to see, Agatha lights up, going from sitting on her forearms to balancing on her hands splayed behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“See?” Rio smiles smugly at Agatha’s excitement and snags the small lube bottle. “I know what you like.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had learned Agatha liked a little anal play a few months into their relationship, Agatha explaining that it made her more sensitive in other places when there was something in there. Rio liked how whiny Agatha got when something was in her ass— it was like the last bit of shame left her, and her only goal was to feel as full of Rio as possible. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio gets on the bed, Agatha is already squirming. </p><p> </p><p>“Sit still,” Rio orders.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grumbles, and she lays fully on her back, trying not to twitch too heavily.</p><p> </p><p>“Show me how badly you want it,” Rio continues. “Spread yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes an ass cheek in each of her hands and opens herself up to Rio. Rio can see multiple things this way: Agatha’s cunt is open and clenching on nothing but impatience and air, and she’s so wet her come has dripped past her perineum down to where it’s sliding near the hole below.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you already helped with starting the lubrication. Thanks, baby.” Rio takes two fingers and presses them against Agatha’s asshole, barely applying any pressure. But it’s enough to make Agatha gasp, her hips bucking as her body and mind beg for more. </p><p> </p><p>“Put it in,” Agatha hisses.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re very combative.” Rio takes her fingers away, but she shakes her head before Agatha can even protest, making a show of putting some lube on both the plug and her fingers. Tossing the lube to the side, she first massages Agatha with her fingers. She grins as Agatha white-knuckles in pleasure, which in turn causes her to inadvertently spread herself wider, causing more sensation. The cycle repeats.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio touches the tip of the flared plug to Agatha’s asshole, she says, “Use your manners.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can watch Agatha hard swallow. “Please? I want to be so full of you I can’t think of anything else.”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio can feel her fingers twitch involuntarily at that. Fuck. She slowly but surely pushes the plug in, watches as Agatha’s face scrunches up in concentration and pure euphoria. It doesn’t take much for Agatha’s hole to swallow what Rio gives her— her girlfriend’s body has always been a greedy one— and Rio gives the flared bottom a few taps for good measure. Her decision makes Agatha squeal.</p><p> </p><p>“You look so fuckable right now,” Rio husks out, her voice gravelly with lust.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinks innocuously as she moves her fingers up to spread her lips, parting them. Rio can see how flushed and pink Agatha’s vulva is, how much her clitoris protrudes, begging Rio for some proper attention. She’s leaking from her entrance, and when Rio has enough brain cell capacity to crawl out of the pit of her mental state and look up back at Agatha, she sees Agatha breathing heavily.</p><p> </p><p>“I need you, baby.” Agatha’s voice is pleading, and the last word has barely left her mouth before Rio is crawling up to kiss her on the mouth. Rio licks shamelessly into Agatha’s mouth, and soon enough Agatha is capturing Rio’s tongue between her lips and sucking. Rio bucks her hips, and her strap-on must hit something sensitive, because Agatha whimpers into the kiss. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha breaks the kiss, panting, needy. “Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s because of the way Agatha says her name that Rio quickly gets up to balance on her knees and using her clean hand, drags her dildo through Agatha’s previous orgasm, swiping Agatha’s clit a few times for good measure. Agatha’s hips jerk, which inadvertently causes her clit to brush against Rio’s cock again. Agatha whimpers.</p><p> </p><p>They had a couple, but Rio had chosen to wear the one Agatha tends to enjoy the most: seven and a half inches, black. Rio liked it, too, because its dark color meant that every time they were done and she’d slide out of a spent Agatha, she got to see stark translucent and white stains on the cock. Sometimes, Agatha would spend time making it spit-shined clean. The thought makes Rio’s mouth water.</p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes still stare glassily at brown. Rio says, “You don’t have to maintain eye contact, anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wets her lip. “What if I want to?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio guides her dick to Agatha’s impatiently twitching entrance, pressing the head onto Agatha’s opening and applying pressure. Agatha moans and locks her ankles behind the small of Rio’s back, pushing so she’d take the hint. Not feeling like being too much of a tease tonight, Rio enters her inch by inch.</p><p> </p><p>When she’s seamlessly sheathed herself to the hilt, Rio purrs, “You’re always so open and ready for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glows under the praise, the corners of her mouth turning up into a smirk. “Hard not to.” When Rio starts on her first thrust, Agatha seems to not be able to help it; her eyes slip closed as a hand slides up to squeeze one of Rio’s biceps. “Oh, fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s nose is only a few inches from Agatha’s. “I thought you wanted me to see your pretty eyes, baby.” When Agatha’s eyes flutter open, Rio smirks. “Hi.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha manages to roll her eyes, but then Rio starts to pick up, propelling her hips to deliver short, quick thrusts into Agatha the way she likes it. Rio says, “You look so good wrapped around my dick, baby doll.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha whimpers as Rio hits a particularly sweet spot with her movements. “I love how you… fuck.” She takes a pause, a shaky breath. “I just love you, Rio. I love you.”</p><p> </p><p>“W-what?” Rio actually stops the pace, shocked. “Are you—”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, don’t stop!” Agatha pulls Rio in clumsily by the shoulders, so that Rio loses her balance and falls square on top of Agatha. It’s a bit stifling, but Rio thinks it feels nice. “Fuck, sorry. You don’t have to say—”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t apologize, jesus.” Rio moves her hands to hold Agatha’s hips, though her face rests in the crook of Agatha’s neck. She starts thrusting her hips again, but a bit slower, this time. “I love you so much. I’m obsessed with you. I think I’ve loved you since I saw you that day in your underwear.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand finds itself scratching at Rio’s head, moving down to cradle her neck. “Oh, god.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t stop. “I’ve never said this out loud. That night, I masturbated. I came to the thought of how it stung when you slapped me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grips tighter into Rio’s hair. She hisses, “You are so pathetic. I love you so much.”</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Rio whimpers. She can feel her orgasm building in her belly. She slides a hand down to start rubbing frantically at Agatha’s clit. Nails dig into her head and shoulder blade as Agatha cries out in her telltale way, the one that tells Rio she’s reached her peak. Only then does Rio let go, grunting and biting into Agatha’s neck as she jerks an uneven rhythm into Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!” Agatha squeals. Her hand moves down to caress Rio’s tensing abs. When Rio looks up at her, Agatha says, “Get on your back. I’m going to ride you.”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio doesn’t have to be told twice. She scrambles into the ordered position, taking a mental moment to look at her protruding cock and bite her bottom lip pretentiously. Covered in Agatha, just like she loves to see. When Agatha climbs on top of her, she rests on one of Rio’s thighs, and Rio can see how the changed position has Agatha tensing at the new feeling of how the plug fits in her. Rio can also feel how wet her girlfriend is, feeling her thigh slick up. She groans. “My good girl. Fuck, you’re dripping.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watches as Agatha’s eyes dilate impossibly further at the possessive pronoun. “I’ve been working on a spell.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio heaves in a breath. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a simple transference spell, but one of the tied objects is a body part, so.” Agatha presses a finger into the head of Rio’s cock. “You okay if I use it?”</p><p> </p><p>A thought bubbles over in Rio’s head. She wonders if her mind is going in the right direction. She nods. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha mumbles a couple of words in Latin, and Rio’s strap glows purple. Suddenly, she can feel the hair on her arms and the back of her neck stand up. Goosebumps form on her legs even though Agatha’s body heat is pressed against them. Agatha smirks when she’s finished. Rio croaks out, “Agatha, did you—”</p><p> </p><p>“A sensual transference,” Agatha specifies, like Rio isn’t able to fucking tell, “from your clitoris to the dildo.”</p><p> </p><p>When her hand grasps around Rio’s dick, she cries out. It’s as if she’s holding… fuck. “And you’re going to—”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to ride you,” Agatha says, and in a sickeningly sweet voice, she adds, “because you know it’s my favorite way, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, god,” Rio moans, and she watches as Agatha repositions herself to hover above Rio’s cock. Rio watches as Agatha’s labia part and her cunt stretches itself to sink down onto Rio, slow and steady. Before Agatha is even fully on, Rio finds her back inadvertently arching and she digs the heels of her palms into her eyes. “Agatha, you feel…” She stops when her voice starts to shake.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s so much warmer than it usually is,” Agatha murmurs. Rio feels Agatha’s ass settle onto her hips as Agatha finishes impaling herself on Rio. she lets out a long, whining moan. “You feel so good. Stars above, I love being full of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha…” Rio is shaking. The feeling of Agatha’s warmth, her wetness, the way Rio can <em> feel </em> her clenching muscles is overwhelming. She can also feel the shape of Agatha’s plug digging into and working with Rio’s cock to mold the current shape of Agatha’s vaginal walls. When Agatha’s hips move an inch in the direction of gyration, Rio’s hands clutch to still them desperately. “God, baby girl, give me a minute. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a laugh that sounds a little too much like an evil cackle for Rio’s liking. “I know you tend to come quick when I ride you normally, but… you’re telling me I barely even have to move?” Agatha clenches her vaginal muscles again, squeezing Rio’s cock, and Rio groans. “Oh, you’re so easy.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio barely manages to squeak out an, “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can you feel how prepared I am for you?” Agatha takes one of Rio’s hands in her own and guides it to her lower belly. Her hips start rocking, and that’s when Rio feels what Agatha wants her to: a slight bulge. “Your cock touches me in places no one else has, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha contracts her muscles a few more times like there’s actually something to milk from Rio’s cock and Rio doesn’t even realize she’s about to orgasm until she’s doing so; she just throws her head back and keens, high-pitched. Rio’s own hips jerk up and Agatha moans as she’s penetrated more deeply.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s it,” Agatha coos, and Rio’s eyes shoot back open when she feels Agatha’s hand cup her cheek. “My pathetic boy.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can only whimper in response. Agatha’s thumb drags across Rio’s bottom lip and keeps her hand over Rio’s as she starts to deepen her movements. When Rio’s other hand touches her back, the intricate lines of her rune, Agatha moans, throwing her head back far enough that Rio can feel the ends of Agatha’s long hair tickle her hand. “You feel so good. Your cock feels so good inside me.”</p><p> </p><p>“It was made for you.” Rio grunts when Agatha slams her hips down particularly hard, and Rio can actually feel the tip of her dick press up into something spongy. “Fuck, Agatha, is that your <em> cervix</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yesss,” Agatha hisses pleasurably, and then she growls, “You’re mine.”</p><p> </p><p>“S’what I’ve been trying to say,” Rio mumbles, and she takes both of her hands to grip Agatha’s hips tightly as her riding gets more frantic.</p><p> </p><p>“This cock is mine.” Agatha leans forward, the hold she has on Rio’s cheek tightening.</p><p> </p><p>Rio croaks out a, “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m close,” Agatha pants. “Fuck me harder.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio starts giving short, deep thrusts into Agatha, and now she’s able to feel how Agatha’s cunt spasms at the movement. Fuck, she can actually feel Agatha’s climax starting. Right before Agatha careens over the edge, though, she takes her hand off of Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>And then brings it back in the form of a slap. It’s just as hard as it was that first day, in the yard, and even though it’s now late November, Rio is just as warm.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” Rio’s hips thrust even higher as the sting on her face surprises her in the tastiest way, and Agatha’s body slackens a little as she peaks. Rio snakes a hand to start furiously rubbing at Agatha’s clit to force her orgasm to ride out longer. Agatha yelps, falling forward and steadying herself by pinning her arms on either side of Rio’s head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues to ride on Rio even after her orgasm has subsided. </p><p> </p><p>“You feel so good,” Agatha sighs. She stills her hips for a movement, stretching her back, fluffing her hair. Rio is mesmerized. “I love how you feel in me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closes her eyes like she’s hearing life changing news. Like she’s hearing something for the first time. “Say that again,” she orders.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you.” Rio grips Agatha’s hips and starts to thrust hard into her. Agatha cries out. Rio repeats the mantra, timing her deepest moment in Agatha to be on the second word in the prayer. “I love you. I love you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha uses one hand to toy with a pierced nipple, and her next orgasm soon follows. She arches her back into it, and Rio gets to see her body uncovered in all its glory. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whines. “I’m close.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha grins wickedly, and she cups Rio’s face. She must hear the want in Rio’s tone. “You have to ask if you want it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Slap me.” Rio says it so quickly it practically blends into the end of Agatha’s teasing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks. “Pervert.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yours.” Rio’s body spasms, somehow shocked when Agatha winds up the flat of her palm and strikes Rio’s face again, even though Rio had asked for it— and it’s the same side she’d hit the first time. Rio gasps wetly, her face now glowing pink. She takes her thumb and starts flicking Agatha’s clit, letting her nail dig into a little in the way she knows Agatha likes it.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha slaps Rio another time, hitting her other cheek. Rio’s climax smacks her next, and as she rides her high, she works on rubbing Agatha’s clit so Agatha can come again shortly after.</p><p> </p><p>Being able to orgasm while feeling Agatha clench around her is incredibly intoxicating, and Rio needs to be able to feel it again and again for the rest of her life. But when she’s on the downhill, she realizes that feeling Agatha’s warm cunt is teetering on the edge of delicious and painful, and now, is starting to fall onto the side of the latter, a coin that’s ceasing to spin and picking a side.</p><p> </p><p>“I need a break,” she gasps. “Feeling you… too much right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, sweetheart.” Agatha lifts herself off of Rio, and both sigh at the change in texture and temperature that brings. Agatha touches the head of the cock, and in a few seconds, Rio can’t feel the pressure of her fingertips on the dildo any longer.</p><p> </p><p>“That was… holy fuck,” Rio says, and she’s glad the spell is moot when Agatha practically rips the dildo out of the O-ring so that she can climb on top of Rio and put her full body weight on her. She wraps her arms around Rio’s neck. Rio hums. “Oh, it’s sloth time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sloth huh?” Agatha lifts herself up just enough that the two of them are nose to nose.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what I’ve been calling it in my head when you like to do this after or in between sex. Sloth time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs as if she’s trying to hide her laughter. She buries her nose into the crook of Rio’s neck. “You’re so ridiculous.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio agrees, “but you love it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm. I really do.”</p>
