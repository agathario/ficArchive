<p>"Agatha?" Rio calls, walking through the hallway from the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"In here, my love." Comes her wife's voice from her office.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio gently knocks on the door before pushing it open, leaning into the doorframe. "Dinner's ready in five, cariño."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She doesn't take her eyes off of her computer when she replies, "I'll be there in a minute."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Rio nods and takes a couple steps forwards into the room properly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At that, Agatha actually turns around. "Everything okay?" She asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I was going to go for a walk later, look at the stars." Rio starts, "Would you like to join me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I..." Agatha sighs, glancing back at her computer, "not tonight, sweetheart, sorry. I need to get this finished."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods and feigns disappointment. "Yeah. Of course."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You know I'd love to join you," Agatha stands up slowly making her way over to Rio, "but my publisher's being an asshole."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." Rio softly smiles at her before taking one of her hands, "Let's eat?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods and takes another glimpse at her computer. "Okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Silently, Rio leads her through to the kitchen and pulls out a chair for her. She presses a kiss to the top of Agatha's head, then dishes up their dinner and places a plate infront of them both.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So..." Rio utters, "what's the new one about?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, taking a sip of her drink. "The new poem?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The new collection." Rio clarifies, tapping her nails over the surface of the table.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well, <em>this</em> collection's all about you." Agatha confesses, before adding quietly, "I'm done writing about my shitshow of a mother."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"All about me, huh?" Rio nudges her with her foot under the table. "What about me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The one I was just working on is supposed to be focused on your eyes." Agatha piles some more food onto her spoon as she speaks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns slightly. "Supposed to be?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs a laugh. "I can't seem to get it right. Every line I write just... isn't working."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hums. "Maybe try something else? Come back to my eyes another day?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Agatha shrugs. "I'll see how it goes tonight."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Following dinner, Rio offers to clean up while Agatha returns to her work, giving her some more time. She can hear the faint sound of clearly frustrated tapping on the keyboard.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once she finishes washing the last bit of cutlery, Rio makes her way to her and Agatha's shared bedroom. She makes quick work of changing her clothes— a black zip-up hoodie and pair of grey jeans. Dark enough for tonight.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without wasting another second, she strolls down the hallway and knocks on the door of Agatha's office again. "I'm heading out now."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay," Agatha spins around in her chair and runs a hand through her hair, "don't be home too late tonight, sugar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I won't be." Rio promises. "I'll see you later, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives a small wave and says, "Enjoy the stars." as a good bye, then gets back to the rhythmic tapping on the keyboard.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On her way out, Rio nips into the kitchen and pulls one of their cutlery drawers open, taking out a knife coming from the set she had bought a few years ago. She also grabs a pair of spare washing up gloves and tucks them into her pocket.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The blade of the knife she picks up is thinner, longer. It has an ebony handle, polished and smooth, comfortable to hold. It's one of her favourites, admittedly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio carefully tucks it between the waistband of her jeans and her belt, removing the risk of it cutting her skin as she walks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Deciding where to do it was the hard part. Alleyways were typical, dark enough and enclosed, usually no cameras.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then there were the parks near the house, easy to access but it made it much more difficult to see, meaning she could mess up easily.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite that, Rio decides on the park. It's earlier than she'd usually go out, so there would be more people if she were to go to an alley. Much riskier.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The hard part was disposal. Rio had imagined at first that disposal would be the easiest part. But no, it almost always left her feeling sick, and on one occasion she passed out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She likes to make it quick. The disposal, that is. She'll take the body and hide it in a bush, bury it in the middle of the forest, throw it in the river, burn it. Simple.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Today was a little different. Rio gets to the park and sets her sights on someone. A man, probably in his late twenties. Dark hair, simple clothes. <em>Easy target.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She follows him for a little while, ensuring that her footsteps are light enough that he doesn't notice her before she wants him to.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That time comes around approximately two minutes later. Rio chooses to go down the slightly more dramatic route, decides to make it a little more <em>fun</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With an overexaggerated gasp, Rio drops to the floor on her knees, loudly, to make sure the man hears her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As expected, he turns around so quickly that he almost topples over. "Jesus, you scared the shit out of me." He mutters under his breath.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio gazes up at him with a fake distressed look on her face, forcing her voice to tremble when she says, "Can— can you please help me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I..." He clears his throat, "with what?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My— I—I dropped my wedding ring." She exclaims, frantically tapping her hands around the floor as if she's looking for the ring which is simply in her pocket.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The man sighs again, but takes a few tentative steps closer. "Alright."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, thank you so much, you're a lifesaver." Rio sighs with false relief, pushing herself out of the way a little as the man kneels beside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, whatever." He scoffs, squinting his eyes and searching around on the floor for said lost wedding ring.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Using the distraction to Rio's advantage, she slowly shifts so that she's knelt behind him, and pulls her hood up over her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She listens to the way the man sighs infront of her, clearly frustrated, and carefully pulls the knife out from where it was kept.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Listen, lady, I've—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He doesn't get the rest of his sentence out. Rio grabs his hair with her free hand, tugging his head backwards so that his neck is accessible.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before he has the chance to react, the scream or call for help, she digs the knife into his throat and drags across it with a clean slice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In his last few moments of consciousness, he weakly grasps at Rio's wrists, digging his nails into the skin a little. It only encourages her to slit his throat <em>again</em>, this time pushing him so that he's laying on the floor, lifeless.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio watches as the blood seeps from the gashes in his neck, pulsating with how strong the flow is. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It mesmerises her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The way it shimmers in the subtle moonlight, how it fills the small cracks in the path. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Getting lost in the blood, she absentmindedly shifts her thoughts to Agatha. To how she might look with blood splattered on her face, with blood on her hands. She feels a heat simmer between her legs at the thoughts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's brought out of her little trance when the man gargles a little on the blood, his body twitching against the floor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That's the moment she takes the initiative to figure out what exactly she's going to do with the body. It takes her longer than she'd like to realise that her only reasonable option is to move into the woods, hide it in some sort of bush.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Not ideal, but it's the best option she has in this moment. Before doing anything, she checks the time. It's been about an hour, if she's gone much longer Agatha's going to start to get worried. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a sigh, Rio pulls the washing up gloves on and grabs the body's arms. It's surprisingly light, a lot lighter than any other body she's worked with. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes a few breaks to fully get the body into the woods, and takes even longer to find a reasonably sized bush to hide it in. But when she does, she takes a few deep breaths and leans against a tree, taking the gloves off. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In her head, Rio replays the moment he died. She replays the blood oozing from the wound, trickling down his neck, onto the ground.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Shit</em>. The ground. There's blood all over the floor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio does <em>not</em> have time for this. She groans thudding her head against the tree before making her way back to the pavement. It would be okay. Right? There isn't even that much. Everything would be fine.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzes in her pocket. In a hurry, she takes a hold of it, already starting to head home.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mi amor: Is everything okay? You've been gone a while</p><p>
<em>9:31pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs and takes a slow blink before replying to her wife's message.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sweetheart: Sorry. Yeah, everything's okay. I'll be home soon, querida</p><p>
<em>9:33pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mi amor: Good. See you soon, my love x</p><p>
<em>9:33pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio practically jogs her way home. Her mind drifts again to the blood, the body, the thought of <em>Agatha</em> in the same situation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>How would <em>Agatha</em> end someone's life? Would she make it hurt? Or would she make it quick, painless? Would she make it messy, or keep it impossibly clean?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Who</em> would she kill? And <em>why?</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio arrives home, she keeps quiet. She takes the few minutes alone to quickly rinse the dried blood from knife and the gloves, then tuck them back away in their designated draws.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After actually fully processing that she's home, and that Agatha hasn't yet greeted her, she tenses a little. Had she lost that much track of time that—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hears an irritated groan from upstairs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Relaxing a little, Rio unzips and throws her hoodie off, onto the sofa. It leaves her in a white sleeveless vest, something she knows damn well Agatha can hardly resist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She can hear the occasional typing on the keyboard as she makes her way upstairs. Slowly, she pushes the door to Agatha's office open a little more, allowing it the creak as to not startle her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Have you been working on that this whole time?" Rio asks softly, walking further into Agatha's space.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her wife just nods, rubbing her eyes and leaning back into her chair. In that time, Rio looks over what Agatha's written. It's only a few notes, random phrases, but Rio adores it to no end.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>a caramel canyon sprinkled with cinnamon</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>warmth of a thousand flames</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>rings of honey surrounding the pits of her desire</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's beautiful, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs a self-deprecating laugh. "I've written twenty words in six hours and it's not even a— a fucking poem."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're exhausted, baby." Rio gently massages her shoulders. "You need a <em>break."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha half-heartedly warns her, "my publisher wants this by Wednesday, I need to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Scratching lightly at her scalp, Rio combs her fingers through Agatha's hair. It causes her words to catch in her throat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You deserve a break." Rio continues, gently untangling Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums contently, her head falling back against the top of the chair. From this angle, she can look Rio in the eye. She can see the burning want in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Let me take care of you, mi cielito." Rio murmurs, her voice breaking into that sultry tone of hers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Biting at her lip, Agatha leans forwards again and saves her work, then shuts her computer off in silence. She then stands up, takes one of Rio's hands in her own, and leads them to their shared bedroom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The moment it's closed, Rio attempts to back Agatha against it, her hands on her shoulders. Though she's stopped by one of Agatha's hands firmly on her sternum.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nuh-uh." She shakes her head. "I'm exhausted, you said it yourself, and there's an <em>extremely</em> comfortable bed just a few feet away."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio presses her tongue to the inside of her cheek with an amused smile, taking a few steps backwards towards the bed and pulling Agatha with her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What's got you so riled up tonight, my love?" Agatha muses aloud, placing her hands on Rio's hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My beautiful wife and her beautiful words." Because Rio absolutely can <em>not</em> say that it's mostly from thinking about her wife <em>murdering someone.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, almost mockingly, and tugs at the hem of Rio's vest before pulling it up and over her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh, you know damn well how beautiful your words are." Rio whispers in return, unbuckling her own belt and dropping it to the floor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They keep eye contact as they each remove the rest of their own clothes, leaving their bras and underwear for eachother. It doesn't take long until they're strewn across the room as well.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha's kissing her. She takes a firm hold in Rio's hair with one hand, while the other wraps around her waist to pull her close. In return, Rio tugs at Agatha's hips until they're completely flush, the bare skin of their stomachs brushing together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Upon hearing a whimper fall from Agatha's lips, Rio turns them and guides Agatha to sit on the edge of the bed. She straddles her thighs, not breaking the kiss once, and pushes her down to lay comfortably on the duvet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio ducks her head down and mouths at Agatha's jaw and neck, who tilts her head to allow her more access.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So fucking pretty for me." Rio mutters, her breath hot against Agatha's skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha whines, trying and failing to gain friction where she needs it, "please touch me. I need you to touch me, angel."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before following Agatha's request, Rio pulls back and gently wraps a hand around her throat, not yet with any pressure, just gauging her reaction.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she had suspected, Agatha places a hand above Rio's and squeezes ever so slightly, encouraging her to do the same. And when she does, Agatha moans beneath her palm, the vibration of it prompting Rio to roll her hips into Agatha's stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio then slides her free hand between her wife's legs, cupping her core over her underwear. She smirks subtly at the immediate rolling of Agatha's hips, the desperate whine that peels from her throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, please, my love." She whimpers, her voice strained with the pressure of Rio's hand around her throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taking her precious time, Rio drags her nails up and down Agatha's inner thigh until she's writhing beneath her. She then slides two fingers through the wetness pooled between Agatha's legs, groaning at the feel of it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Baby—" Agatha can hardly get the plea out before Rio's hand tightens just enough around her throat to cut off her breathing for a few moments.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh." Rio coos, leaning down to brush their lips together in a soft kiss. She then gives Agatha just what she wants, driving those two fingers into her and curling them just how Agatha likes it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Only then does she loosen her hand a bit, allowing Agatha to take in a deep gasp of air. She moans as she breathes out, rolling her hips to meet each of Rio's thrusts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha brings both hands to cup Rio's jaw, pulling her closer into a deep kiss. She easily glides her tongue between Rio's lips, brushing against Rio's own and pressing against the roof of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They both groan into the kiss, Rio keeping a firm grip on Agatha's neck, keeping her pinned to the mattress. Agatha's arms shift to wrap around the back of Rio's neck, dragging her impossibly closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The kiss breaks when Agatha more or less loses the ability to continue it, instead running her hands up and down the expanse of Rio's back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, Rio, I— I'm close, <em>please."</em> She stammers, still with a slight strain in her voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're doing so good for me," Rio husks, manoeuvring her thumb so it rubs against Agatha's clit just right.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my— <em>God</em>, please don't st—stop."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wouldn't dream of it, mi vida." Rio gives Agatha's throat a quick and gentle squeeze, acting as some sort of catalyst to her undoing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio continues to fuck her through her orgasm, getting every possible drop of pleasure from her, and only stopping when Agatha's breathing calms.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gently pulling her fingers out, Rio moves her hand from Agatha's throat to her hair, stroking at it gently. As she sucks her fingers into her own mouth, cleaning them off, Agatha's eyes flutter shut with a sigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once Rio's fingers are clean, she brings that hand to join the other in Agatha's hair. She can tell by Agatha's breathing that she's still awake, but she isn't quite sure how long that'll last.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio attempts to shuffle off of Agatha, to help her properly into bed to sleep, but falls unsuccessful when her wife tightens her hold on her, keeping her close.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes, and when Rio thinks Agatha's actually drifted into sleep, she's pushed to lay on her back. A yelp makes it's way out of her mouth, and she watches as Agatha straddles her lap, leaning down and resting their foreheads together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio laughs lightly through her words, "Agatha, you need to sleep."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, don't be so dramatic, sweetheart." She then slips a hand between Rio's legs, circling her clit with impressive precision.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers, her eyes falling shut and her back arching into Agatha's touch.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There you go, that's it." Agatha breathes, resting her head in the crook of Rio's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Keep going," Rio gasps, "you feel so— so good."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha angles her fingers just slightly differently, finding that spot that has Rio's hips jerking against her hand. The moment it's found, Rio's jaw falls open with a sharp moan, tightening her grip on Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're so gorgeous, Ri." Agatha breathes, still panting a little in recovery to her own orgasm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It brings another needy whine from Rio's mouth, rolling her hips into Agatha's hand. She starts to feel the signs that Rio's close— the slight shaking of her legs, the way her muscles tense up, her moans becoming louder and higher pitched.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Agatha voices the four words that she knows will give Rio that little push she needs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Such a good girl." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>, oh my— <em>Agatha,"</em> Rio chokes out a moan, clenching around nothing as her orgasm rushes through her body.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha keeps a gentle stimulation on Rio's clit as she comes, removing her hand once it's clear all the aftershocks have ebbed away. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Now</em> we can sleep." Agatha sits up in Rio's lap with a grin before climbing off of her and fluffing the pillows up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio follows suit, slipping beneath the duvet and immediately reaches for Agatha, who happily gets pulled into Rio's hold.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you so much, sugar." Agatha says, curling into Rio with her head resting on her chest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love <em>you</em>, mi corazón." Rio replies easily, kissing the top of Agatha's head and tugging her a little closer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Rio feels herself drifting into sleep, her eyes drooping and her breathing growing shallower. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She isn't sure whether Agatha's still awake, but she says it anyway, "Good night, mi amor."</p>

<p>Rio had met Agatha twelve years, four months and eighteen days ago. She had taken over her father's florist's after he died, and she had been running the shop for three weeks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The twenty-second day was Mother's Day. Rio had only had a few customers, when a <em>stunning</em> woman walked in. The very first thing Rio noticed about her was her hair. Long and wild, like a lion's mane. Then, her eyes, and soon after, her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And the very first words she spoke to Rio were, "Do you have any flowers that resemble, like, pure hatred?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I do." Rio had said, with a light laugh. "Yeah, uh...there's a few options."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go on?" The woman had leaned on the desk, tapping her nails rhythmically.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Black dahlias, they— they're more about jealousy, so if it's an ex-boyfriend you're trying to spite, then—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The woman had chuckled, "It isn't. And even if it <em>was</em>, it would be an ex-<em>girlfriend."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had forgotten how to speak. She had cleared her throat, stammering her next words. "So, who— who are you trying to piss off?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My mother." She had stated, then held her hand out, "My name is Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio." Agatha's hand had lingered, catching her bottom lip between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They had fucked in the backroom thirty minutes later.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They would see eachother multiple times a week, and it was supposed to be casual. But then Rio, of course, went and caught feelings. How could she not? Agatha was and <em>is</em> beautiful. Not to mention, the sex was and <em>is</em> amazing. But to find out that Agatha had felt the same for <em>months</em> might have been one of the best moments of Rio's life.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To Rio's surprise, Agatha was the one who proposed. She had taken Rio to dinner, to an aquarium, then got down on one knee right infront of the shark tank. It was perfect.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They had been married for around two years when Rio started to get the intrusive thoughts of murder. Not to murder Agatha— <em>never</em> Agatha. She had somewhat coped for a month and a half before she acted on the thoughts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It started small, maybe one victim every two months. She was good. Scarily good, and never got caught. Then, it got a little worse. Rio had gradually started to kill more often, sometimes even three or four victims a <em>month</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn't need to know. In the whole six years this had been going on, Agatha did <em>not</em> need to know. She never needed to know.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sure, Rio didn't particularly like keeping anything from her wife, but <em>this— killing people?</em> It would ruin everything. She'd scare Agatha away, and she'd be insanely lucky if Agatha didn't decide to call the police on her. Rio can't never see her again, she wouldn't survive it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio keeps it from her. It hurts like hell, but she does it. When Rio chooses to take her next victim, it's two weeks from the last. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She tells Agatha she's simply going to work, and while she is, Agatha doesn't know that she's going to get someone in the backroom, close up early, and murder them in the second half of her day.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha uses her time at home to work on her new collection. It starts to go well, better than she had expected, and she's started to work on the penultimate poem for it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's about five words in when her phone buzzes, and she eagerly picks it up to check.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sweetheart: How's the writing going? x</p><p>
<em>2:23pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mi amor: Good. Enjoying work today? x</p><p>
<em>2:23pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sweetheart: Yeah, it's pretty quiet. I'll be home by four today</p><p>
<em>2:24pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mi amor: Thank God. I'm getting so bored in this big house all on my own. What ever will I do?</p><p>
<em>2:24pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sweetheart: Tease.</p><p>
<em>2:24pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mi amor: You love me xx</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sweetheart: I really do ♡</p><p>
<em>2:25pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles to herself before setting her phone back down and turning to her computer again. It's almost funny to remember that Agatha is so incredibly unaware of what her wife is doing at this very moment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had gone for a slightly older man than herself this time. The type who would find a younger woman and cling themselves to her, take her out and make a trophy wife of her. The type which were easy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She had clearly captivated him at first sight, seeing as he came right up to the counter and asked for her name. Giving a very fake smile and name, she helped him while pretending to get all flustered over his utterly disgusting comments.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Getting him in the backroom is easy enough. All she had to do was flirt a little and throw a wink over her shoulder when she went to <em>check in the back</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He follows her in, trailing closely behind, and closes the door behind him. At least it saves Rio doing it herself. Though, as Rio had expected with this approach, the first thing the man does is reach out to grab her by the waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She jerks back a little, away from his grubby hands and points a finger at him, attempting to make it flirtier and much sexier than she feels. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Need to close up." She says, shrugging. "Wait here."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The man, whose name she never learnt nor cared for, does as she says and leans against one of the shelves. When Rio returns after reluctantly sending a customer out and locking up, she takes a deep breath and opens the door to the backroom again, locking it behind her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, are you gonna blow me or what?" He unbuckles his belt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>The only thing I'm blowing is my wife's strap.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Rio scoffs under her breath in response to his question, not loud enough for him to hear, then reaches into her pocket and pulls out her favourite knife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He laughs a little. "Woah, kinky, I like it. You gonna cut my trousers off?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Something like that." Rio murmurs, kneeling down infront of him. Immediately, his hands reach for her hair, but she bats them away with the flat side of the knife. "Don't touch me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The man practically growls his next words. "Get on with it then, you slut."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffs. At least she knows this one will deserve it when she watches the light bleed out from his eyes. She teases the knife up his legs, from his calf to his thigh, but she doesn't stop where he expects her to.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instead, she drags it up his stomach and quickly sinks it into the flesh with a rough squelching sound, a splattering of blood landing right on her cheek. He doesn't even <em>scream</em>, thankfully, only chokes out a groan of pain.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio expects that to be it. She expects him to go limp against the shelves, for him to fall to the floor and for her to stab him a few more times for good measure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What Rio doesn't expect is when the man kicks into her shoulder, knocking her onto her back. With her firm grip on the knife's handle, it gets pulled out of him with the force. Rio loses her grip on it as her back thuds into the hardwood floor, causing it to fling across the room with a loud metallic clatter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Crazy <em>bitch."</em> He crosses the room, but he doesn't run. Somehow, what he does instead is worse than running.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He grabs the knife off of the floor, still coated in his blood, and climbs ontop of Rio, who's still stunned from the kick.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a few moments, she wonders if this is it. If that morning was the last time she'd ever see Agatha, ever hear her voice, ever hold her—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The man attempts to thrust the knife down into Rio's chest, but it's stopped just short of actually stabbing her when Rio's reflexes beat her mind and catch his wrists with both hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She can't hold it for long. It slowly grows closer, nudging at the fabric of her shirt. And <em>then</em> it cuts into her skin. It brings a pained whimper from the back of her throat, and she uses the rest of her strength to push the knife to the side, shoving her knee up into the man's stomach in the process.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the knife's journey, it slices through her arm, ending up dug into the floor which is now stained with both the man's and Rio's blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The man gets to his feet a lot quicker than Rio had hoped, all his injuries considered. She shuffles away backwards a little, but he reaches down and grabs her by the collar of her shirt and yanks her up to her feet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"St—" She's genuinely about to <em>plead for her life</em>, but she's thrown into one of the shelves with a rattle, her words catching in her throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're fucking insane." The man grabs her again, just to push her into the table in the middle of the room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The force of it causes the table legs to scrape along the floor, Rio's hands grasping at the edges of it to keep herself steady. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm married." Rio blurts out. "Please, I—I'm sorry, I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shut the fuck up. Fucking pathetic..." He laughs mockingly, keeping eye contact with Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When the man next walks over to her, he just grabs her and throws her to the ground again, bringing yet another choked out sound from her. This is <em>not</em> what's supposed to happen. She wasn't supposed to get beaten to death and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A faint glimmer reaches the corner her eye.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She turns to the source and, yes, the knife is right beside her. Using some of her remaining physical strength, she pulls it from the floor and hastily turns around, swinging it at the man's ankles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It startles him, and he drops to the floor with a yelp, clasping his hands around the gash on his ankle. Rio uses the chance to climb over him and place her palm flat over his mouth. Her other hand reaffirms it's grip on the knife, and, once it's enough, she shoves it deep into his stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Breathing heavily, almost groaning with each exhale, Rio pulls it out, then back in again into the previous wound. Finally, <em>finally</em>, she feels him grow weaker beneath her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That's when she decides to remove her palm and instead grip his hair, pulling his head back to reveal the column of his throat. She takes the knife again and presses it there, almost teasingly, then cleanly slices it across.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instead of leaving it at that, when he's very clearly dead, Rio plunges the knife into his chest again, his stomach, his neck, <em>anywhere</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her face feels wet. Had she been crying this whole time? To be safe, she wipes her sleeve across her face and she's met with..pain? A sharp pain in her forearm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Oh, that's right</em>. The wound in her arm steadily oozing blood. Fuck, how was she going to explain that to Agatha?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha</em>. Rio needs to go home. Needs to see Agatha. Fuck the body, she can deal with that tomorrow, or whenever the fuck she wants to. For now, she just needs her wife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio rips a piece of her shirt off and lifts up her sleeve, then quickly wraps it around to wound to cease the bleeding. Once that's sorted, she grabs a random hoodie which had been left another day, and throws it on, covering any sign of her physical wounds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Perfect. She leaves without even checking her reflection, without checking whether it's obvious she's just killed a man. The check whether the wetness on her face was tears or blood didn't even have a conclusion, but that didn't matter to Rio right now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All that matters is Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't even know what time it is when she opens the front door. When she carelessly kicks her shoes off, and rushes to go upstairs with the intention of cleaning herself up before Agatha sees her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She had barely heard the sound of Agatha greeting her, let alone the steady footsteps coming from the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, it's half past five, what—" Agatha cuts herself off with a sharp intake of breath at the sight of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, I—I just need to...I'll be back in a second." She tries to move past her and go upstairs to lock herself in the bathroom, but she's stopped by a pair of hands on her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, you've—" Agatha reaches up and cups her face, which now feels a little sticky.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Must have been blood after all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What happened?" She asks restlessly, wiping at some of the blood with her thumb.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— nothing, I'm— I'm fine." But she isn't fine, not really. It feels as if she can't breathe, like any second she's just going to <em>break</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, but what— what happened, my love?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>God, the look on Agatha's face is going to fucking kill her. Rio tenses a little and puts some effort into pulling away, but Agatha keeps a firm hold of her. "I'm fine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, come on, tell me what happened. You're shaking, sweetheart."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Is she? Rio hadn't even noticed— so caught up in the concern on Agatha's face that she's somewhat forgotten what lead her here.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just wants her to be okay. It's so fucking evident on her face and all Rio's doing is pushing her away and trying to—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can't." Rio speaks before running it through in her head. "It'll ruin everything, you'll— you'll <em>hate</em> me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's words might as well have shot a hole in Agatha's chest. "You don't know that, darling."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just shakes her head, avoiding Agatha's eyes. What the hell is she supposed to say? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, baby, please just talk to me. What's going on?" Agatha asks, softer this time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can't." Rio repeats helplessly. "I don't want to never see you again and you won't— won't trust me, you'll be <em>scared of me."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The longer this back and forth goes, the more difficult it gets to breathe. The bruises that have gathered on Rio's ribs certainly aren't helping, either.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What?" Agatha frowns, sliding her hands down to Rio's shoulders again. "Sugar, I promise it'll be okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—" Why the fuck does Agatha have to be so fucking convincing with her sweet fucking pet names and reassuring words?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's okay, sweetheart. I promise I won't be upset." Her tone is so fucking genuine. <em>So</em> genuine that Rio actually believes her for a minute.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I...I k—" She can't get the words out. Her eyes squeeze shut and her mind floods with the negatives again, the ones that tell her Agatha's going to hate her, that she'll—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm right here, baby, please just tell me what happened." Agatha's voice is so soft and gentle and Rio's about to ruin their marriage with three simple words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I k—killed someone." Rio only realises she's said it when she feels Agatha's hands tense on her shoulders, stopping the gentle massaging.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wait— wait, what?" Her voice is hushed. Unsure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a big step back out of Agatha's hold, still forcing her eyes shut. But she can't fucking speak, why can't she get any words out?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you...are you serious?" It's a little louder this time. Like Agatha's just properly processed Rio's words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Forcing a stiff nod, Rio slowly opens her eyes. She doesn't look at Agatha though. Instead, she just paces through the hallway, scratching at the back of her neck and tugging at her own hair a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha still doesn't say anything. She's just stood there, watching Rio fall apart. Say something— someone needs to say something.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I fucking <em>told you</em> it would ruin everything and now you—" Rio can't stop the words tumbling from her mouth, "you're going to call the police and I'll never see you again and—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, look at me." Agatha's voice, soft and firm, stops Rio in her tracks. She only speaks her next words when Rio's eyes meet hers. "It's okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Rio shakes her head, now fully aware that she's openly crying with the way Agatha's now looking at her. "No, it <em>isn't."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At that, Agatha's a little confused, but she looks...calm? Rio does <em>not</em> understand why, so she does the only thing she can think to do. Push her away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It— it wasn't— wasn't just one, well, it— it was <em>today</em>, but—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How many?" Agatha asks, keeping a few steps from Rio, respecting the small boundary she's set. "In total."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns, then quietly admits, "I—I don't know."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha nods, and takes another look over Rio's blood and tear covered face. "Tell me something— how many times have I told you that I love you and that nothing will ever change that?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's frown strengthens a little. She wraps her arms around herself in a small hug. "What?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because it's <em>true</em>, my love." Agatha presses. "I know you would never hurt <em>me</em>. I trust you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You shouldn't. What if I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You won't." Agatha gently cuts in an takes a slow step towards Rio. "You won't hurt me and I trust you not to."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just stares at her blankly, her chest heaving in ragged, uneven breaths. She watches as Agatha lifts a hand, requesting permission, and Rio gives a small nod.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The moment she does, Agatha pulls Rio into a hug, wrapping one arm around her waist and one round the back of her neck. "Breathe, sweetheart. It's okay. I'm right here, I'm not going anywhere."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I've killed so many people, Agatha." Rio clings to the material of her wife's shirt, nuzzling her face into the crook of her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha runs a hand up and down Rio's spine, comforting, then speaks two simple words. "I know."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio isn't sure how long they stand there. She isn't sure how long she replays Agatha's words in her head. She isn't sure how long she cries into her. She isn't sure how long she's spent staining Agatha's shirt with the leftover blood, with her tears, her sobs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But when Rio speaks, and her voice is all raspy and quiet, she can guess it's been longer than she could think. "Sit down." She says. "Let's sit down. And we should probably...talk, right?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If you're ready to." Is what Agatha says when Rio makes no clear move to follow through with her own suggestion.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not entirely." She admits, tightening her hold slightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We can take it slow." Agatha gently pulls away, running a hand through Rio's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods in response, taking a hold of Agatha's hand and walking them both through to the living room, onto the sofa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Why isn't Agatha trembling? Why isn't she terrified? Rio just confessed to being a fucking serial killer and she's acting like this is some regular Tuesday evening for them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha takes a seat beside Rio, still keeping hold of her hand, intertwining their fingers. "Let's start with... how long have you been... doing this?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hand twitches a little. "Fuck, uh... a—about six years?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Six <em>years?"</em> Agatha repeats, "God that's—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm so sorry." Surprisingly, it's the first time Rio's said it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, no, I'm not upset," Agatha quickly says, brushing her thumb over Rio's knuckles, "I was going to say that it must have been so difficult to carry that on your own for so long."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." Rio sighs, relieved. But then, Agatha asks another question.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Why— why did you... or, why <em>do</em> you... do it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs a laugh free of joy. "Do you remember when I'd wake up in the middle of the night having panic attacks?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods silently, encouraging her to continue at her own pace.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It was because I kept thinking about it. Couldn't <em>stop</em> thinking about it. So I did it and then... couldn't stop." Her words are slow, gaps between them, but Agatha allows her to take her time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods slowly, and tightens her grip on Rio's hand when she asks curiously, "So, why can't you stop?" And when Rio inhales sharply beside her, she quickly adds, "And I—I'm not asking you to or telling you to, I just—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It feels good."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good?" Agatha repeats.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." Rio hums so quietly that Agatha can barely hear it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clears her throat and shifts in her seat a little. "Good... how?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Rio knows <em>exactly</em> what Agatha's asking her, she just isn't saying it explicitly. Rio looks over at her and whispers, "I have a feeling you know how."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay," Agatha breathes, looking away for a moment, and repeating, "okay," before turning back to Rio again, "So— so killing people...gets you going?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can't help but laugh lightly at Agatha's phrasing, and while it isn't exactly <em>wrong</em>, Rio feels she needs to clarify a little. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not just <em>killing."</em> Rio speaks slowly, carefully, as if testing the waters. "The whole...act. The blood, the...taking someone's life. I think about you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A pause. Then, "Killing me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Rio holds her free hand up, speaking much louder than she had intended to. "No, I—I would never— no. I mean, like...think about you...with the blood, or <em>you</em>... doing the— the killing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha nods.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns herself to look at her properly, and when she sees the look on her face, she... is this conversation getting <em>her</em> going?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay?" Rio parrots, looking over Agatha's face again. Slightly flushed cheeks, pupils dilated more than usual. She wonders if Agatha's just sitting in a pool of her own wetness.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha says again. Then, without looking at Rio, as if trying to hide her glaringly obvious arousal, she asks, "How often do you do it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This whole...discovery? about Agatha makes Rio feel just that little bit more confident about this whole conversation. Knowing what it's doing to her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Now?" Rio muses. "It's maybe...two or three a month."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes in a sharp breath, and for a moment Rio wonders if she should have downplayed it, but that goes out the window when the exhale turns into a huff of laughter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha nods, looking at her, "You were right, that's...a lot of people."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Rio agrees easily. There's no point in trying to disagree, she knows it's a <em>lot</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's next question surprises her. She had expected a few, but nothing like, "Do you regret it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio takes a moment to think, before saying, "Sometimes. God, I do now that I'm— now that you know about it all."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Why?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio also hadn't been expecting <em>that</em>. "I...don't know." She frowns. "I mean it's something I've kept from you for six years, you're my <em>wife</em>, I didn't like keeping things from you, but <em>this..."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not upset that you kept this from me." Agatha speaks clearly. "I understand why you did, and that you were scared and didn't know what to expect. It's okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio isn't sure what to say to that, but she knows that saying, <em>yeah I certainly didn't expect for this to so clearly turn you on, otherwise I would have told you years ago,</em> would be just a little bit inappropriate.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues with a sigh, "I'm just a little...frustrated with myself that I didn't realise something was going on."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't be." Rio squeezes Agatha's hand a little. "I put a lot of effort into keeping it from you, keeping you safe."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio..." She sighs again, this time her eyes flickering to Rio's lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I didn't want you to get hurt." Rio says. "I—I didn't want to hurt <em>you."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You won't hurt me, my love." Agatha states. "How...what happened today?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I just..." She shrugs, "needed to do it, and an <em>easy target</em> came into the shop."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And you..." Agatha trails off, but the question still lands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I killed him, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. But the blood, Ri, it's...all over you." Her words are breathy, and Rio genuinely thinks she's about to combust with how wet Agatha's words are making her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's nothing." Most of the blood isn't even hers after all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure you're okay though?" Agatha furrows her brows, turning her whole body to look at her properly and placing a hand on her cheek.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I'm fine." She smiles. Despite everything, Rio fucking <em>smiles</em>. "He just tried to fight back, that's all."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean? What did he do, are you hurt? Did he hurt you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>God, Rio's going to kiss her if she isn't careful. "A little, I—I'm okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Where did he hurt you?" Agatha's eyes cover the whole of her body, and in that moment, Rio's glad she chose to throw that jumper on and hide the wounds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I just— he shoved me around a bit and— Agatha, <em>sit down."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha runs a hand through her hair. Of course the moment Rio tells her she's hurt is when she actually starts to panic. "What did he do?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tried to— to stab me but I'm <em>fine</em>, it just nicked me a little—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally sits down, but reaches a hand out to Rio. "Can I see?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, he's <em>dead</em>. I fucking <em>killed him."</em> Rio reiterates.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." She holds eye contact, though it's half-lidded.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio looks away, she feels tears prick at her eyes. "I...I thought I was going to die. He was going to kill me, Agatha, he— I— I never would've seen you again—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans forwards, wrapping Rio into her arms and holding her close. "It's okay, I'm right here. I've got you, I'm not going anywhere, my love."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"He—" Rio tries to continue, but she's cut off with her own sob. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me what happened, sugar." Agatha requests gently. "He hurt you, tell me what he...what happened?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She may as well get it all out. "I st—stabbed him and he kicked me over and then— then he grabbed the knife and..." She gestures to her chest, "it only nicked me, but he was going to— to stab me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio feels Agatha's hold tense a little, before going back to the comforting shapes over her back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I caught it before he did and pushed it out the way, but it caught my arm too. I, uh— pushed him off and then he dragged me to my feet, threw me around a bit. I got the knife back at one point and...killed him."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha sighs and presses a kiss to the top of Rio's head. "Fuck, okay. I wish I was there to— God, I'm so sorry, Rio."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I thought he was going to kill me." Rio chokes out with another sob.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's okay, sweetheart. You're okay, you're here with me. It's— It's okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But Rio can tell the words are mainly directed to Agatha herself. "Don't be worried. I'm okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha abruptly pulls away. "Let me clean you up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just looks at her blankly, shocked that <em>she's</em> the one being comforted here and not Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please, my love? Let me take care of you. Please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, Agatha." She nods, and allows her to take her hand and help her to her feet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can— can you walk okay?" She asks, putting an arm around her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm. Mostly." It's actually rather painful on her right knee, but Agatha doesn't need to know that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instead of saying anything else, Agatha simply keeps a gentle hold on her as she leads her upstairs, to the bedroom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's guided to sit on the bed, where Agatha just stands back and stares at her for a moment before saying, "Wait here."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can't help but worry that Agatha's changed her mind and run off to call the police, but when she steps back into their bedroom with their first aid kit, she relaxes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Silently, Agatha sits on the bed beside her and carefully unzips Rio's hoodie, regularly looking up at her face for any signs of discomfort or pain.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can see the moment Agatha notices the cut on her arm. Still, without a word, Agatha unbuttons her flannel and gently pushes it down her shoulders, taking extra care around the cut on her arm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha's gaze falls on the small cut on Rio's chest. It's a little deeper than Rio remembers it being, with a clear trail of blood falling down her chest, to her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are there any more cuts anywhere?" Agatha asks, her voice trembling a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head. "That's everything."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She nods, then places a hand over Rio's ribs and lightly strokes the skin, "You're bruised."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I am?" She says quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs. "He really fucking hurt you, Ri."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." She winces a little as Agatha takes a wipe and cleans around the wound on her chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just— please be careful." She pauses to look Rio in the eye. "I can't lose you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I will be." She nods.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha places a small plaster over the cut in Rio's chest, grazing her thumb over it before moving to the wound on her arm. She takes a hold of Rio's arm with one hand, and wipes the majority of the dried blood away. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, I need you to promise me something."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio inhales harshly, "Yeah?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Promise me you won't run away." She pauses the cleaning for a moment. "That you're going to stop trying to scare me away—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not trying to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, you are, sugar." Agatha says with a soft smile. "You want to keep me safe, okay, fine, but you don't need to distance yourself or avoid me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stays quiet. She lets Agatha speak even if it's to promise the last things she wants to do.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, promise me that you're going to stay. That you'll be here when I wake up. That you won't— I don't know, turn yourself in so that I'm not the one to do it. I don't want to be apart from you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I..." Rio stammers, trying to find the words, to at least force herself to promise it. She's only really just processed that Agatha's wrapped a bandage around her arm, and is now putting everything but a couple wipes back in the first aid kit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not going to turn you in." Agatha takes a wipe and starts to clean some of the blood off of Rio's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't say anything. She <em>can't</em>. Not when Agatha's caring for her like this after everything she's told her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, honey, look at me." She wipes some blood from Rio's cheeks. "I am not going to call the police. I'm not going to tell anyone, I'm not going to turn you in. You're safe with me. I need you to believe me, to trust me, because I can <em>not</em> lose you, okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"...Okay." Rio's voice is barely there, but Agatha hears it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She finishes cleaning up Rio's face and unceremoniously drops the first aid kit and blood-stained wipes on the floor. "Okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I believe you. I trust you." Rio shuffles a little closer to her and takes her hand. "I won't run away, and I won't...won't try to scare you away. I'll stay, I'll— I'll be here when you wake up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're missing one, sweetheart." Agatha tilts her head to the side with a sweet smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I won't turn myself in." Rio replies quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cups Rio's cheek. "Promise me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I promise." She says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you, Ri." Agatha leans closer and presses her forehead to Rio's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you." She brushes their lips together, but leaves Agatha to make the final move.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The last way for Agatha to express her trust.</p>

<p>Agatha closes the distance between them without hesitation. It's tender and gentle, and she moves her hand up to curl into Rio's hair. It earns her a soft moan, and she soon feels Rio's tongue against her lips, requesting access.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's access which is easily provided, sliding their tongues together. Rio takes a hold of Agatha's hips, gripping the fabric of her shirt and pulling her closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sound of Rio's voice from only twenty minutes ago floods Agatha's mind. The tone of it, the <em>words</em> she was saying.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"The whole...act. The blood, the...taking someone's life. I think about you."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans into the kiss, gradually becoming more and more aware of the wetness between her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"I mean, like...think about you...with the blood, or you... doing the— the killing."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hips rock into nothing out of their own accord. It frustrates her, how turned on this entire conversation has made her, and she groans against Rio's lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio matches Agatha's pace though, she tilts her head to the side to deepen the kiss further, she tugs Agatha closer until they're completely flush.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, in a little surge of confidence, Agatha pulls away slightly, keeping her eyes closed. "I need you to tell me how you did it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She feels Rio hesitate, wondering whether she thinks it's for other reasons than what they actually are.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha flutters her eyes open and softly moans at just the look on Rio's face. <em>"Please</em>, I'm so fucking wet, Rio."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're..." Rio trails off, her eyes flicking between each of Agatha's and her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I need to fuck you. Please." She husks, pulling Rio closer by her hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She follows the movement, climbing into Agatha's lap and rolling her hips a little with the muscle memory. "You want me to..."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, don't act like I'm the only one who's <em>soaked</em> right now. I know that you're—" She's cut off by Rio's lips against her own, her words dying into a hum.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs Rio firmly by the hips, encouraging her to grind into her lap. It doesn't take long until she breaks the kiss to see what she's doing, and unbuttons Rio's trousers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Show me how you did it." Agatha breathes, resting her head on Rio's sternum.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Show you?" Rio repeats, and before Agatha can reply, she continues, "Give me a safeword."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles lightly in the haze of anticipation and pleasure, pressing a kiss to Rio's collarbone. "Azalea."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The second the word's hit Rio's ears, she stands up, earning herself a whine of protest from Agatha. "Take off your clothes and lay down."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches her move across the room for a moment as the words settle in her brain, and the moment that the command is processed, she follows through.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once she's laying down comfortably, she looks back over to Rio. Rio, who's digging through the bottom drawer of their bedside table. Who pulls out a harness and dildo and is suddenly completely naked.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a second, Agatha's eyes land across each bruise and scratch on her, but the look on her <em>face</em>. She's brought from her thoughts when the harness thuds on the bed beside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Put this on." Rio says. "I'll be back in two minutes."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can hardly even get any words out. She just uselessly nods and pulls the harness up her legs and tightening it to her liking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio returns, she's holding a bloodied knife. She must have noticed the way Agatha's breathing's quickened, trembling, because she stops in her tracks and tilts her head to the side in silent question.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, a little more enthusiastically than she had intended to show, but she decides that doesn't matter when Rio walks over to her, biting her lip. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She watches as Rio holds the knife up to her own mouth, dragging her tongue across the flat sides of it, cleaning the blood from it. Agatha can't help but whine at the sight.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Rio climbs onto the bed and straddles Agatha's thighs, she holds the handle of the knife between her teeth, giving her both hands to steady herself with. Those hands land just below Agatha's breasts, gripping tightly at her ribs as she hovers over the toy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands instinctively reach out to hold Rio's hips, helping to steady and guide her. It seems to be the small encouragement that Rio needed, because she lowers herself down onto the strap, whimpering and moaning at the stretch of it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Their skin comes in contact, drawing a desperate groan from both of them. After catching her breath for a moment, Rio takes a hold of the knife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She reaches down, wrapping a hand around Agatha's throat and pulling her to sit up for a moment to say, "Remember your word, okay, querida?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, "Yeah. I'll— I'll remember."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With that, Rio abruptly drops her. She sets a painfully slow pace with her hips, simply rolling her hips the way she knows drives Agatha crazy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"When I got him on the floor," Rio says breathlessly, "I had to cover his mouth so that no one heard him scream."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath hitches as she repeats the action on <em>her</em>, placing a palm over her mouth. Fuck, if Rio keeps this up she's going to come like this when she's hardly being touched.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, cold metal. It grazes lightly from Agatha's sternum, between her breasts, and ends at her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I pushed the knife <em>deep</em> into his stomach." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha <em>moans</em>, involuntarily arching her back and causing the blade to break her skin. She then nods quickly, answering Rio's unasked question of <em>are you okay?</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio continues. She slowly pushes the knife a little deeper, drawing just a little more blood, before pulling it up and hovering it over the wound.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The vibrations of Agatha's whimpers against her palm combined with <em>Agatha's blood</em> trailing down her body is going to push Rio to the edge much faster than she'd like. She slows the movement of her hips, until they're hardly even moving. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just occasionally rocking gently, hardly putting any pressure on what Rio needs, and hardly putting any pressure on what <em>Agatha</em> needs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio carefully presses the tip of the knife into the wound again, deepening it just slightly. Agatha's eyes squeeze shut with another whine, her nails digging into the skin on Rio's hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— <em>fuck</em>, he got weaker." Rio continues, removing her palm from Agatha's mouth and instead gripping her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans, shifting her legs and hips, desperate for friction that she can't find. The hand in her hair tugs until Agatha's throat is fully accessible, faintly bobbing with each swallow.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio lightly presses the knife against Agatha's throat. "I slit his throat." She whimpers at the memory. "It's how— how all the blood got on my face."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You looked so fucking good." It's the first full sentence Agatha's offered in ten minutes, but it's worth it after hearing the moan it earns her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I stabbed him again," Rio chokes out a moan, "and <em>again, and again."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers again when the blade makes contact with her stomach, and she, this time consciously, arches her back and draws a little more blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She sees the way Rio looks down at it. Her eyes dark and half-lidded, as if she's restraining herself from—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chucks the knife carelessly to the other side of the bed. She takes her middle finger and collects some of the blood on the tip of it, smudging red across Agatha's skin in the process.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Barely holding back her whimpers, Agatha watches as Rio takes that finger into her own mouth, swirls her tongue around it, moans around it. Her hips jerk a little at the sight, unintentionally driving the strap a little deeper into Rio. The moan it brings makes her want to do it again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But all Agatha can seem to do is watch, her chest heaving with desire. Watch Rio taste her, watch her eyes fall shut, and she can see some of her own blood staining Rio's tongue. She sees <em>and</em> feels how Rio starts to roll her hips again, presumably subconsciously.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes this moment to her advantage, to gain some semblance of control. "Tell me what you think about when you kill someone." She says, her voice a sultry tone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At first, Rio releases a breathy mewl at Agatha's words, before dropping her own finger from her mouth and replying, "I think about <em>you</em>, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Think about me, h—how?" Agatha presses, pushing herself to sit up in an impressive show of strength.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hips move faster, uncontrolled, like the moans which continue to cascade from her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri." Agatha guides her to fuck herself on the strap <em>harder</em>, reminding her to respond.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— I imagine you covered in— in blood." She gets her words out between desperate moans.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's in this moment that Agatha's realised how close she is. The way the strap is now nudging her clit <em>perfectly</em>, the way Rio looks, the words she's saying.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I imagine you slitting someone's throat and— and having the blood spray onto you—" Rio tenses above her unexpectedly, dropping her head onto Agatha's shoulder as her orgasm rushes through her body.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>, Rio," Agatha's thrown into her own climax, her moans landing right in Rio's ear, much to her delight.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They hold eachother as they recover, despite being sweaty and their skin sticking together. Agatha slowly leans back, bringing Rio with her, and they lay like that for a while.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had thought Rio's fallen asleep, but she sits up properly and lifts herself off of the toy, exhaling sharply with the sudden emptiness. She then unbuckles the harness and pulls it down Agatha's legs, before dropping it down on the floor by their bed with a loud thump.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio lays back down, it's beside Agatha, on her back. She delicately reaches out and takes Agatha's hand, playing with her fingers and drawing patterns into her palm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you, sweetheart." Agatha turns over to face her properly, reaching her free hand out and tucking a strand of Rio's hair behind her ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, not daring to look at Agatha when she asks, "How?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How, what?" She props herself up on her elbow and cups Rio's cheek, pulling her gaze from the ceiling to look at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How can you...<em>love me</em> after everything I've told you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, listen to me. You're all I've got. I met you at one of the worst times in my life, and you—" She brushes her thumb over Rio's cheekbone. "I've never loved anyone like I love you. <em>Unconditionally."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But, Agatha, I've—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, my love, I know you've killed people." She deadpans. "I don't care. I don't fucking care, okay? It doesn't matter to me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her blankly, her eyebrows pulled together in a soft frown.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"All that matters to me is that you're <em>safe</em>, and that you're <em>with me.</em> Okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No answer comes, but Agatha notices how Rio's eyes slowly gloss over with unshed tears.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nothing is going to change that. I need you to believe me." She says, admittedly a little desperately. "I'm not...<em>scared of you,</em> I don't want to leave you, I don't want to call the police. Because I <em>love you</em>. And <em>nothing</em>, and I really fucking mean it— <em>nothing</em> is going to change that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Rio whispers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha sighs, relieved. She then leans forwards and seals the promise with a soft kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hums into it, pulling her closer to the point where Agatha's practically ontop of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Let me prove it to you." Agatha mutters against her lips, "Let me take care of you, sweetheart. Can I?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At hearing the desperation in Agatha's tone, Rio bites her lip, nodding. Almost instantly, Agatha dips her head and drags her lips and tongue across her wife's neck, sucking the skin until it bruises.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers as Agatha trails her hand down her body, not hesitating to glide a finger through the wetness pooled between her legs. She gently drives two fingers inside of her, before adding a third once she's felt how little resistance there is.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck,"</em> Rio chokes out a sound crossed between a moan and a sob, a few tears sliding down her cheeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The tears aren't from pain or anything <em>negative</em>, they were formed following the overwhelming care that Agatha's provided, <em>the love.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't notice until she feels one of Rio's tears drop onto her face. She pauses the gentle movement of her fingers and leans up, placing a hand on Rio's face and wiping her tears.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you— do you want me to stop?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head and huffs a watery laugh. "No. Please don't stop."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha presses a tender kiss to her lips before carrying on, curling her fingers just right and kissing her neck again. "You're so fucking pretty, my love."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In response, her back arches, and she involuntarily clenches around Agatha's fingers. And in this very moment, Agatha knows exactly what Rio needs. Reassurance.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's okay, baby. Relax, I'm not going anywhere." She says, pressing her lips to Rio's shoulder. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's whimpers grow a little louder, her chest heaving. Agatha knows she's close, having still been worked up from her last orgasm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're so good for me." She breathes. "I love you, honey."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—" Rio's coaxed into her climax before she can respond, moaning right beside Agatha's ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's it, there you go." Agatha coos, pulling her fingers out and making a quick job of licking them clean.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio loses control of her tears the moment she's recovered from her orgasm. With a sob cutting through the silence of the room, Agatha rushes to wrap her arms around Rio, pulling her in close and guiding her head into the crook of her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Did I hurt you?" She asks quietly, to which Rio quickly shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, it— it was perfect— <em>you're</em> perfect." Rio stammers, her shaking hands curling into Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She kisses the side of Rio's head, "Alright, it's okay, I've got you." And draws circles over her spine, soothing her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't know how long she holds Rio while she cries, but she knows that she's happy to do it for as long as her wife needs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But when Rio's breathing begins to settle, and no longer shakes, Agatha strokes a hand through her hair. "Rio?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm?" She presses her head further into her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want some dinner?" She asks. "I made it before you came home."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods. "Yes, please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They eat in almost complete silence, though Rio doesn't eat much at all. Agatha, at first, tries not to comment on it, not wanting to make Rio any more stressed than she already is, but she's only had two mouthfulls of food.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, is something wrong?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She shakes her head. "Not with the food."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha waits for Rio to elaborate, rather than asking her to. If Rio wants to, then she will.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just...working out how I'm gonna ask what I want to ask."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She nods in understanding. "Take your time. But in the meantime can I ask <em>you</em> something?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go ahead." Rio has a small bite of her food.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't care if you go out to...to kill someone, but I just ask that you tell me when you do it. And where you are."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitates for a moment, before humming. "Okay. Yeah."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah? Good. Just so I know that you're safe." She murmurs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Y'know, today is the first time I've gotten this badly hurt. I'll be okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know you will be." Agatha offers her a soft smile. "Have you decided how you're going to ask <em>your</em> question yet?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I need to sort out the...body tomorrow, and clean up, but I can't keep the shop closed, so...can you come and deal with the customers while I'm..doing that?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah, of course." Agatha nods. "Anything you need."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It won't be a problem for your writing?" Rio frowns, but is already eternally grateful.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's quick to respond. "Not at all, this is more important. <em>You're</em> more important."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she had expected, Agatha isn't the ideal person to be running a flower shop on behalf of her wife. Having to discreetly message her after she gets asked a question she doesn't know how to answer is rather awkward, seeing as she's just in the backroom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha wants to, and will, do anything she can to help. So, if that's running the shop for the day, so be it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio has a specific way to dispose of those she had killed in the backroom. She'll bring in her carving knife, and use the cleaning supplies she keeps in the shop. In the main shop, there's an oven which she uses to burn any diseased plants. She uses that to dispose of the body.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, with Agatha just next door, she chops the body in manageable pieces, resulting in much more blood than the amount which had been left yesterday. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She gags a little as she puts the body parts in bags, ready to take through to the oven. Though, she absolutely cannot leave the backroom with this much blood on her hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Quickly, Rio grabs her phone and pulls up her wife's contact.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sweetheart: Need to use the oven, can you kick anyone out and close for lunch?</p><p>
<em>1:31pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mi amor: Yeah, of course, sugar. I'll knock on the door when it's empty x</p><p>
<em>1:31pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio responds with a heart emoji, before picking up the bags and leaning against the wall. The memories of yesterday start to sweep through Rio's mind. The knife cut her. She almost <em>died</em>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A soft, hesitant knock on the door brings Rio from her mind. She steps over and takes a few deep breaths before opening it to see Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At first, she just stares at her with her lips parted. "You...there's some blood on your face."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." She reaches up to her face with equally bloodied hands, attemtping to wipe it away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't." That's when Rio notices how dilated Agatha's pupils are. "Leave it. I want to fuck you before we open back up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses. "I— okay. Yes, please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The cremation is done within fifteen minutes, and the ashes are disposed of in one of the bins outside. It's the only part of the disposal Rio allows Agatha to do, considering she can't really have other people see her with blood all over her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio then discovers that Agatha was entirely serious about fucking her before they open up. She's dragged into the backroom, which <em>still</em> has blood staining the floors, and is pulled into a desperate kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taking a little control, Rio backs Agatha into the wall, gently curling her hand around her throat. It brings a whimper from Agatha's lips, and Rio eagerly drinks up the sounds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, the longer they spend fucking in the blood-stained backroom, the less customers Rio will get, the less money she'll make. So, <em>unfortunately</em>, Rio needs to keep this in mind, as much as she'd love to spend the rest of the day fucking Agatha in the blood-stained backroom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hurriedly, Rio pushes Agatha's legs apart with one of her own, sliding her knee up until it presses into Agatha's core. The kiss breaks as Agatha's head drops back against the wall with a thud.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs a laugh, which soon trails off into a moan. "Fuck, Rio, <em>I</em> was supposed to be fucking <em>you." </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure you can multitask, cariño." She practically purrs her words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha then feels Rio's hands on her hips, dragging her to grind into her knee. Moments later, Rio's hands are back in her hair, making it clear that she wants Agatha to work for her own pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But she complies without question, setting a steady rhythm for herself as she unbuttons and unzips Rio's jeans, desperately shoving her hand underneath Rio's underwear, and pushing two fingers inside of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers from both the pressure on her own clit and the feel of Rio's arousal. Looking up at Rio's face, at the blood dotted around, knowing how coated her hands are with red.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she grinds down a little harder into Rio's knee, she works her fingers faster, desperate to come simultaneously. That gets increasingly unlikely, though, with the way all of the blood on Rio's face is making her feel.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her orgasm hits her unexpectedly. With her hips stuttering and jerking against Rio's knee with the pleasure, her fingers momentarily pause between Rio's legs. Agatha drops her head onto her wife's shoulder for a moment, catching her breath and groaning at the sound of Rio chuckling against her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Already?" She teases, grinding into Agatha's palm as some type of reminder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha ignores it at first. She lifts her head up and grabs Rio's chin with her free hand, forcing their gazes together. "Shut up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Then</em>, Agatha really isn't sure what possessed her to do so, where the urge came from, and she isn't sure she feels completely in control. But she leans forwards and tilts Rio's head to the side a little, giving her more access to glide her tongue across her cheek and lick up some of the blood collected there.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It brings a needy whine from her wife's throat, and Agatha produces one of her one in response, but partly due to the taste of the blood on Rio's skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues to move Rio's head around as she starts to move her fingers again, licking every last spot of blood on Rio's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you have <em>any</em> idea how fucking good you look like this?" Agatha breathes a whimper, leaning back to look at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can only moan in response, her eyes slipping shut. It encourages Agatha to experiment a little, see what can make Rio break.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"God</em>, I just want to fucking <em>ruin</em> you." She purrs, landing a quick, dirty kiss to Rio's lips, before asking, "Is this how you feel when you think about me like this?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, her eyes never leaving Agatha's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah? You want to see me covered in blood?" Agatha murmurs, her voice too shakey to be a tease. She grins when Rio mumbles a soft <em>fuck, Agatha, yes.</em> "You want to watch me kill someone for you, Ri?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To which Rio's mouth falls open with a desperate whine, rocking her hips into Agatha's hand with every thrust.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because I would." Agatha hardly even knows she's speaking anymore, too high on watching Rio fall apart.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Oh, fuck,"</em> Rio's knee jerks suddenly at a slight change in angle from Agatha's fingers, pushing right up into Agatha's core before dropping away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It causes Agatha's next words to be laced with a breathy mewl, "I would do fucking anything for you. Just ask and I—" Her head falls back against the wall with a small rush of pleasure in her lower stomach. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She frowns, slightly confused due to the lack of stimulation, but she keeps her eyes trained on Rio, thrusting her fingers faster. By now, Agatha's <em>broken</em> her, but she can't get over the effect her words have on Rio. Rio, who probably thinks she's exaggerating or <em>lying</em> just to get her going. <em>She isn't.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'd kill whoever you want, darling, just ask." Agatha whimpers with her words. "Please, Rio. Please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's Agatha's <em>begging</em> that does it. That sends Rio head first into her climax, collapsing into Agatha while crying her name. And then, Agatha feels that tight coil of pressure between her legs, and before she realises what's going on, she's had an orgasm herself. Untouched.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes her a moment to process, and a few more to push the slight shame down. A part of her hopes Rio didn't realise, but when she's recovered and studied her face, a smirk grows on her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Did you just—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shut up." Agatha groans, hiding her face in Rio's neck. "Shut up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She ignores her, and finishes. "Did you just come?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe." She mutters quietly against Rio's skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I didn't even touch you." Rio's grin is audible in her voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just groans again, pushing closer into Rio as if she's trying to burrow there. "I <em>know."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't you dare be embarrassed." She says, pulling her face up to look at her. "That was so fucking attractive, cariño."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't say anything, unsure <em>what</em> to say. She assumes that saying <em>yeah, talking about killing someone for you just really did it for me</em> is off the table right now. So, instead, she opts for just kissing the smug smile off of Rio's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're amazing. I love you." Rio mutters against her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her again, then replies, "I love you, too, sweetheart."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Did you mean it when you said that?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stutters a little, unable to find her words. She hadn't expected Rio to ask that. For a second, she tries to figure out what Rio's specifically talking about. She comes up with two viable options.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"You want to watch me kill someone for you, Ri? Because I would."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"I'd kill whoever you want, darling, just ask. Please, Rio. Please."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"When I said what, that I love you?" Agatha asks with an obviously fake cluelessness, shaking her head slightly, as if she has no idea whatsoever.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"When you said you'd kill someone for me." Rio leans her forehead to Agatha's, barely suppressing a whimper. "When you practically <em>begged</em> me to ask you to."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gapes at her for a second, then shrugs. "I don't know what you're talking about." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio pushes, but stays gentle, "you're an awful liar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She licks her lips, glancing down at Rio's. For a moment, they just look at eachother in silence. Honestly, Agatha isn't sure that she meant it. Maybe she did, deep down, but she didn't know if she would <em>actually—</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hand slowly curls around Agatha's throat, drawing a gasp from her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want to kill someone for me, Agatha?" Rio's voice is low, sultry.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And now, Agatha is <em>very</em> sure whether she meant it or not. She nods, her breath shuddering.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Her wife's eyes have hardly any brown left in them, almost completely devoured by the black of her pupils. "You want me to watch?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." It's just a whisper, but it's enough.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls her hand away, tenderly kissing Agatha's lips before taking a step back. "I want you to think about that <em>very</em> hard for me, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Blankly, Agatha watches as Rio picks up a few cleaning supplies from the shelves, and slides on some disposable gloves.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want you to be sure that it isn't just the lust talking," Rio clarifies, kneeling down and spraying some cleaning product on the bloodstained floor, "because there is <em>no</em> turning back."</p>

<p>Three and a half weeks pass. They don't speak about the whole <em>I want to kill someone for you</em> thing, but neither of them have stopped thinking about it. It's slipped out a few more times during sex, too, twice when Rio was using the knife on her, and once when <em>Agatha</em> was using the knife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They don't talk about it. Rio's waiting for Agatha to bring it up, to find the right words, but Agatha's still trying to find the right words. Sure, she would do anything Rio asked, and <em>sure</em>, she likes to think that that extends to murder, but would she actually do it?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Would <em>Agatha</em> grab hold of a knife and take someone's life?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That's her issue. She isn't sure if Rio's right, if it really just is <em>the lust talking.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Besides, Rio hasn't killed since the night Agatha found out. It's becoming increasingly difficult to bring it up outside of sex, when murder isn't the topic of the day at the dinner table anymore.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On the twenty-sixth day since the first <em>I want to kill someone for you</em> incident, Rio kills someone new. Before leaving the house, Rio had told Agatha, just like she asked. She had also said that she doesn't usually go this long without doing it, but the urges had gotten too strong to ignore.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To which Agatha had told her <em>it's okay, my love, you don't need to stop for me.</em> So, Rio told her exactly where she'd be going, and left to do what she needed to do.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had her up against the wall the moment she came home.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Day twenty-eight, Agatha takes Rio out on a date. She hopes it can be a little relaxing before they go home and Agatha finally talks to her about the whole <em>I want to kill someone for you</em> thing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's taken her wife to an Italian place a few blocks from their house, and they're sitting across from eachother in a booth, awaiting their dinner.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, is there a reason for taking me out tonight or did you just feel like it?" Rio asks, narrowing her eyes a little with a subtle smirk playing on her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs. <em>There absolutely is a reason.</em> "Just felt like taking my beautiful wife out on a date." She says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"As I said a few weeks ago, querida, you're an awful liar." She laughs lightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few weeks ago. The day they fucked in the backroom, the <em>I want to kill someone for you</em> day. Rio brought it up. Subtly, discreetly, yeah, but she brought it up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I..." Agatha clears her throat, "need to talk to you about that, actually."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, and I—" She catches the sound of someone's voice in the booth beside them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Though, it isn't <em>who</em> it is, it's what they're saying.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"—hear about the body in the—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio seems to have caught on too. They both freeze and glance up at eachother, staying as silent as they can.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"—no evidence, but it was fucking <em>brutal—"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can see Rio start to panic, see her chest rising and falling unevenly. She reaches across the table, taking Rio's hand, and mouths the words <em>it's okay, you're okay.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"—whoever did that is a fucking monster—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio inhales sharply, though her chest is tight, and attempts to blink away the growing tears in her eyes. Agatha squeezes her hand a little tighter, but Rio abruptly stands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Be back in a minute." She forces out, her voice shakey, and rushes to the toilets.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sees as clear as day that Rio's about to have some sort of breakdown, but she knows her well enough to leave her alone unless she asks otherwise. So, she waits, but continues to listen in to the conversation behind her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I mean, I saw the photos, he was basically <em>gutted."</em> The woman's voice sounds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It must be an exaggeration. Right? Rio didn't tell Agatha anything like that. Maybe it was a different victim entirely?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, and in a park too, fucking insane. The murderer's sick in the head." Now, a man's voice. No, they're definitely talking about Rio's victim. The gutting <em>has</em> to be hyperbolic, surely.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Deserves the death penalty."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stops breathing. She suddenly stands up and circles round to their booth, clearing her throat. "Do you fucking mind? Some people are trying to eat, and you're talking about a dead body."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They both look up at her before awkwardly turning back to eachother, then finally down at the table.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." She says, with an overly sweet smile painted on her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she moved back to sit down again, her phone buzzes. Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sweetheart: Feel like I'm gonna be sick</p><p>
<em>6:53pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mi amor: Do you need me?</p><p>
<em>6:53pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sweetheart: Please. Far left cubicle</p><p>
<em>6:53pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha speed-walks into the bathroom, gently knocking on the door of the cubicle so she doesn't startle her. After Rio opens it and allows Agatha inside, she returns to her spot beside the toilet, propping her head up on the rim with her elbow.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, it's okay." Agatha says, kneeling down and locking the door behind her. "You're okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha spends a few seconds taking in her appearance. Her cheeks stained with tears, her eyelashes wet, her breathing uneven, shakey, strained. The last time she saw Rio having a panic attack was the night she told her about the murders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can— are you okay to be touched?" Agatha asks, lifting a hand slowly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, closing her eyes tightly as Agatha pulls her closer into a hug.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just breathe with me, my love. It's okay." She says softly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No— no, I'm a <em>monster."</em> She chokes out a sob, fisting one hand in Agatha's hair and the other in her blazer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, baby, no you're not." She shakes her head, kissing the top of her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just holds her tighter, sobbing harder into her shoulder. She's trying so hard to breathe properly, but the breaths continue to come in short gasps.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Look at me, sweetheart," Agatha cups her jaw and faces her, then places her other hand over Rio's heart, "take a deep breath in, hold for three, and breathe out, can you do that for me, honey?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As the time goes on, Rio's breathing becomes more in time with Agatha's, slowing and becoming much easier. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's it. Good." The worry in Agatha's brow relaxes a little, feeling Rio's heart rate slow beneath her hand. "You're okay. It's gonna be okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you so much, Agatha." She leans back into the wall of the cubicle, pulling her knees up to her chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you. Listen, my love, you're <em>not</em> a monster. You're not sick in the head—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"They said that?" Rio frowns, staring down at the floor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, blinking slowly. "Yes, but it isn't true. They don't know you, they don't understand."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her wife slowly nods, pushing her tongue into her cheek with unshed tears in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What do you need, honey?" Agatha changes the subject.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She runs a hand through her hair. "Can we just go home?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After paying for their drinks and cancelling their food orders, Agatha gently guides Rio to the opposite side of her, and places a hand on the small of her back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On their way through the restaurant, Agatha purposefully walks past the couple which were unknowingly talking shit about Rio. Without looking, she swings a hand out and nudges one of their wine glasses, knocking it straight into the woman's shirt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The woman throws her arms up, "What the—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cuts her off with an overly dramatic and <em>obviously fake</em> gasp, stopping in her tracks and putting her hand over her mouth. "Oh, my <em>apologies!</em> I am <em>so</em> sorry."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stifles a laugh, looking down at the floor. She decides to join in on it. "Come on, <em>querida</em>, let's go home." She pushes Agatha along a little, then turns back to the couple in the booth. "Lo siento, my wife is just <em>so</em> clumsy."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The couple look <em>furious</em>, but before they can make any type of retort, Agatha takes Rio's hand and drags her through to the doors of the restaurant.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After they return home, Agatha throws on some documentary about plants and orders some food for dinner. Rio sits beside her, her head on her shoulder and their fingers entwined.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Didn't you say you wanted to talk about the..." Rio trails off, not wanting to say the words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha looks at her and cups her cheek. "It can wait, my love. Relax."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They eat their dinner together on the sofa, only moving to put their plates back down once they're finished. It doesn't take long until they each fall asleep against eachother, leaving the documentary running in the background.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wakes up first the next morning. It's around nine, she guesses, seeing as the sun's softly shining through their window, illuminating her wife's face gorgeously. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Said wife is still in a deep sleep, following being exhausted yesterday evening, so Agatha leaves her to sleep in a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gently prying herself from Rio's hold, she makes her way upstairs to have a quick shower. The first few minutes under the water, Agatha spends thinking about the conversation she's ultimately going to need to have with Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She knows Rio won't forget about it. Agatha spends the next thirty seconds scolding herself for saying she needed to talk about it in the first place.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When she finishes with the shower, she brushes through her hair and throws on one of her robes, then runs a hand through her hair and goes back downstairs. From there, she sees Rio laying on the sofa, picking at the skin around her fingernails.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There you are." Rio says, before even looking up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Didn't want to wake you up, darling." Agatha responds, cracking a few of her knuckles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio looks up, she groans. "You showered without me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You were asleep!" Agatha chuckles. "Besides, I thought I could make us some breakfast while <em>you</em> shower."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, fine, but only if it's pancakes."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Whatever you want, my love." Agatha leans over her and strokes a hand through her hair, pressing a kiss to her parting. "It'll be ready in twenty— do you want banana with it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please— thank you, mi amor." She gives her a gentle smile before standing up and making her way up to the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha has all of the pancakes made within ten minutes, but stores them in the oven to keep them warm for when Rio comes back down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's halfway through chopping one of the bananas when she hears a vigorous knock on the front door. It makes her frown, placing the knife on the counter by the chopping board and quietly walks over to the door. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The first thought is that it's the police. Agatha knows that this isn't the first time one of Rio's victims have been looked into, infact, it usually <em>does</em> happen. But Rio's good. She's careful and she's <em>clean</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But when Agatha opens the door, her breath hitches and it takes everything in her not to slam it closed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mother?" Her brows furrow. "What are you doing here?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, is it a crime to see my daughter nowadays?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs. "Well, I was actually just in the middle of making breakfast for Rio and I, so if you wouldn't mind coming back, or just leaving, I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't be so dramatic, Agatha." Her mother pushes past her into the house.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, go ahead." Agatha scoffs under her breath, then raises her voice a little and says. "My wife's expecting breakfast, I need to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This <em>wife</em> of yours has you cooking for her?" Evanora laughs, mockingly. "She has you doing the chores, too?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I <em>like</em> cooking for her, Mother." Agatha counters.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ralph would have never made you a housewife, you could have had a real job."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I <em>do</em> have a real job." She frowns. "Why are you here? Have you just come to insult me again, like always?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Evanora narrows her eyes, taking a step closer. "What's your problem today, Agatha?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My problem is that you turn up unannounced, you don't care that I'm busy—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A sharp slap echoes through the room. Agatha can't help but laugh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you serious?" She scoffs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pull yourself together. First you marry a <em>woman</em>, and then you can't even get a real job so you just—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is everything okay, mi amor?" Rio's voice sounds from the stairs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha, with her cheek still a little pink, keeps her gaze on Evanora. It doesn't take Rio long to clock what's going on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Evanora." Rio puts a fake smile on her face. "We weren't expecting you, but it's always<em> such a pleasure</em> to see my <em>mother in law!"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Evanora scowls, ignoring her. "You need to sort your life out, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, so you <em>are</em> just here to insult me." She shakes her head and chuckles hollowly. "Of course."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio moves beside her, wrapping a possessive arm around Agatha's waist. She's always delighted in pissing her mother off.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well, Evanora, I'm afraid my wife and I were making breakfast, so how about you...y'know...<em>leave?</em>" The last word is said sharper, with more authority.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nonsense." Agatha's mother shakes her head. "Agatha needs to hear what I have to say. Maybe <em>you</em> should leave."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio genuinely laughs. She sighs. "Whatever you have to say to <em>my wife,</em> you can say to me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Each and every time Rio refers to Agatha as her wife, it upsets Evanora just that little bit more. So, when the look of disgust on Evanora's face is clear that it won't go away any time soon, Rio guides Agatha into the kitchen again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What do you want to do?" Rio asks quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whispers in return, "I don't know."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's lead her to the counter, and stands beside her as she continues to chop up the banana from before her mother came waltzing into the house like she owns the place.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Did she hurt you?" Rio lightly brushes her fingers against Agatha's cheek.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm okay, my love." In other words, <em>yes, but please don't do anything, my love.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio simply nods in understanding, and leans closer to land a tender kiss on her lips. However, the clearing of Evanora's throat from behind them breaks them apart with a sigh. Agatha briefly looks at her as she speaks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We're married, Mother, if you're going to complain every time I kiss my wife then maybe you should <em>leave</em>, like we <em>asked you to."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I said we need to talk, Agatha. Without your <em>friend."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My wife." Agatha corrects, her grip on the knife tightening. At this point, she isn't even chopping the banana, just holding the knife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You are disgusting, Agatha— marrying someone like <em>her!"</em> She snaps, thumping her hand against the wall.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You need to leave." Agatha says again. She hasn't turned around to look at her mother, only leaning against the counter with the knife in one hand, Rio's hand in the other.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Evanora just ignores her, and points an accusing finger at Rio despite neither of them being able to see her. "And as for <em>you—</em> corrupting my daughter."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha actually turns around at this, but doesn't even say anything.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can't believe I ever tried with you, Agatha." She scoffs. "I ought to have killed you the moment you left my body."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She inhales sharply at the comment, placing a hand on Rio's arm to stop her from saying anything, fighting back. Then, she just turns back around in silence.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good luck, Agatha! Enjoy the horrible life you've built for yourself," She huffs a mocking laugh and turns around, "and tell your wife what a mistake she's made marrying you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, spinning on her heel, the knife still in hand. She had turned in time to see her mother walk out of the kitchen, through the hallway, towards the front door. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Behind the sound of her own heavy breathing, she somewhat hears Rio's voice beside her. "Let her go, mi corazón." A gentle hand lands on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha sees her next movements as a blur. Her legs start moving before she can even think about it, carrying her across the room, following her mother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's voice is only a murmur, "Agatha, pl—" She follows her for a few steps before spotting the knife in her hand. "Agatha?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Upon hearing her daughters strong footsteps, Evanora turns around in the hallway with an amused smirk. A smirk which quicky disappears when Agatha grabs the lapel of her top and shoves her into the nearest wall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio forgets how to breathe. She watches as her wife pushes the knife she's holding directly into the centre of Evanora's chest, a choked scream leaving her in the process.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She watches as her wife twists the knife then pulls it out just to stab her again, this time blood spewing out with force. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She watches as Evanora's body goes limp against the wall, she watches as her wife stabs her <em>again and again</em>. "Agatha..." Her mouth has gone dry, her lips parted at the sight. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes seven stabs for Agatha to let her own mother's body drop down the wall onto the floor. She stares at it for a second, ignores Rio as though there's nothing else in the world. And as if talking to a child, Agatha sighs, crouching down next to Evanora's body. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She reaches out to her and strokes once through her silver hair, before gripping it tightly and pulling her head back, making her throat accessible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio forgets how to breathe. <em>Again</em>. It's pathetic really, the way she's been reduced to a mess just by watching her wife murder someone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Watching as Agatha <em>slits her throat,</em> and a string of blood shoots out from her mother's neck, directly into Agatha's face and chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath hitches with the sudden feeling, but when she exhales, it comes out as a whimper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The feeling of utter euphoria at the sight of her mother's blood coating the floor is too much. It takes over, and Agatha can't help but shove the knife into her chest over and over and <em>over</em>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This time, when Rio speaks, she can hear it, "Okay— Agatha," She tentatively walks over to her and spots a couple stray tears escaping her eyes. Her wife continues to repeatedly push the knife into Evanora's chest, stomach, <em>her fucking face.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio kneels down behind her, placing her hands on her shoulders and slowly trailing them down her wife's arms until she finds the knife in her hands. She gently pries it from Agatha's fingers, and chucks it across the hallway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Upon the knife being out of her hands, the realisation hits Agatha like a fucking train. She just <em>killed</em> her mother. Losing the ability to hold herself up, she collapses into Rio, whose arms instantly wrap around her waist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't say anything at first. She just holds her. She can remember <em>her</em> first kill— it felt good but it was fucking overwhelming.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her breath wavers a little as she realises now that she has the answers to the questions which would haunt her mind when she was killing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>How would Agatha end someone's life?</em> Brutally. Overkill.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Would she make it messy, or keep it impossibly clean?</em> Incredibly messy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Who would she kill?</em> Her own mother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>And why?</em> Because she's a cunt who had it coming.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes her a few moments to realise that Agatha's...crying? She's trembling in her arms, but it doesn't <em>sound</em> like she's crying.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's okay— are <em>you</em> okay?" Rio asks, unsure what else to say. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't reply at first, but she turns around and looks Rio in the eye. Rio's breath catches in her throat at the sight.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It turns out her wife <em>does</em> look fucking delicious with blood all over her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha's shaking hands come up to cup Rio's cheeks. "I'm okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's still having an extremely hard time finding any words when Agatha's sat right there in her arms with blood all over her face and chest and arms— <em>all over her.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry." Is the next thing Agatha says, frowning. "I— I don't know what..."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's— It's okay." Rio says again, stumbling over her words. "It's okay, I'm not— you're okay, don't— don't apologise."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hands then drift up to Agatha's hair, tugging a little so that her face is more in the light, so she can see the way the blood shimmers with it. They each moan softly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Wait</em>. Rio freezes. "This— this is all my fault."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What?" Agatha holds Rio's face a little more firmly. "No, my love, this— I fucking <em>killed her</em>, Rio, if this is anyone's fault, it's <em>mine."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, because if I hadn't—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri." Agatha cuts in softly. "This is <em>not</em> your fault, you didn't make me do <em>shit</em>, okay?" She waits for Rio's quiet <em>okay</em> before continuing. "I'm fine— <em>more</em> than fine, it felt fucking amazing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, combing through Agatha's hair. "Okay. Don't you feel...I don't know, sick?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Agatha breathes, resting her forehead against Rio's, closing her eyes. "Rio, I'm fine, I just—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my God, are you gonna pass out?" She asks frantically.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans back a little and frowns. "What?" Then, a smirk grows on her face. "Are you seriously not getting what I'm trying to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her blankly with concern still washing over her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha licks her lips, "I'm not going to pass out, this isn't your fault, and I really, <em>really</em> need you to fuck me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A whine tumbles into the space between them, and neither are entirely sure who it was.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck," Rio's head drops against the wall, her eyes falling shut, "wanna fuck you so bad."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha licks her lips again, this time getting a small taste of the blood on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Uh-huh." She pulls Agatha's face closer until their lips are brushing. "Fuck, I imagined you'd have some sort of breakdown, but—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, stop talking." Agatha leans forwards and kisses her before she's gotten all of her words out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It prompts Rio to reach down and grab Agatha's hips, pulling her to sit in her lap and rock her hips into her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio encourages her, guiding each time Agatha drags her core over her. They're both only wearing a robe. Nothing underneath. <em>Just a robe.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio suddenly breaks away, frowning. "Wait, wait, wait—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What? What's wrong?" She immediately stops and looks over Rio with worry, as if she's hurt her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"As desperate as I am for you, I can't fuck you next to a dead body." She states, to which Agatha nods. "So, give me five..." She glances at the body again, "maybe ten minutes, and go wait upstairs, okay? I'll be there soon."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." She nods, then bites at her lip a little as she stands up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And don't you <em>dare</em> start without me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But, baby, I'm <em>soaked."</em> Agatha groans.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a breath and looks at her for a moment, before standing up and taking a hold of the ribbon holding her robe closed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She tugs on it, pulling it out of the belt loops and leaving the robe to fall open. As she takes in the pure desire in Agatha's eyes, she reaches forwards and grips her wrists and, careful not to make it too tight, she ties the ribbon around them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers at the pressure, flexing her fingers as Rio ties the ribbon off. When she looks into her eyes, Rio raises an eyebrow— a silent <em>is this okay?</em> Agatha nods, another whimper entering the space between them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio brushes her lips against Agatha's knuckles, then lightly taps her hip. "Go on. I won't be long."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha impatiently makes her way upstairs, Rio just chuckles and shakes her head, then looks down at the body. <em>Jesus</em>, it's hardly recognisable as Evanora. She stares for a good fifteen seconds before remembering that Agatha is waiting for her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, as quickly as she can, she grabs the body's wrists and drags it through the hallway. It leaves a <em>large</em> smear of blood in it's wake, and Rio just feels herself get wetter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Agatha did this.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio reaches the door to their basement, she's out of breath, as she usually is after dragging a body around. She opens the door, then carelessly pushes the body down the stairs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shit—" She winces as the body makes a much louder sound than she had anticipated.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks down at her hands, the fresh blood coating them, and licks her lips. She doesn't bother cleaning them, she's ninety percent sure Agatha would want to be the one to do so. On her way back upstairs, she kneels down and grabs the blood-soaked knife that Agatha had killed her mother with. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A shiver rushes down her spine at the memory of it. The blood, the sounds— the sounds <em>Agatha</em> had made, the way she looked at Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After giving herself a good thirty seconds to lose herself in the memories, Rio makes her way upstairs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Though, against Rio's expectations, she catches the sound of soft sighs and moans. She pauses just outside of the room, her hand hovering by the door handle, taking a moment just to <em>listen</em>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her cue to enter is brought on by a whimpered, <em>"Fuck,"</em> From the other side of the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes the door open relatively quickly, and is met with a sight that really shouldn't have made her as wet as it did.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's managed to tuck a pillow between her legs, and practically folded it in half to create a firmer surface to ride on. Rio just watches as Agatha's hands, still tied, grip the fabric of the bedsheets. She isn't sure how long she's stared when Agatha speaks up breathily.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There you are. What took so long?" She asks, and she must've hit a particularly good angle, since her elbows buckle a little, causing her head to drop down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio only closes the door behind her though, not yet trusting herself to voice a reply, Agatha pushes herself to sit up and turns her head to look at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes are drawn immediately to the red coating Rio's hands. "Fuck, where did all the—" Agatha sighs a moan, "—blood come from?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Again, instead of voicing a reply, Rio takes the knife out of the pocket of her robe, delighting in the way Agatha's movements against the pillow falter for a moment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a few steps closer, and stops right beside her wife. She then reaches for the pillow, roughly dragging it out from underneath her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Hey</em>, I was using that." Agatha half-heartedly complains, but groans with the sudden lack of stimulation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before dropping the pillow onto the floor, Rio catches sight of the wet patch in the fabric. "Fuck, you really <em>are</em> soaked." She muses.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Ri, please,"</em> Agatha whimpers, trying to shift her legs and hips to gain any type of relieving friction.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Watching her squirm, Rio drops the pillow and kneels down on the bed infront of Agatha. She reaches a hand out and presses it to Agatha's sternum, pushing her to lay back on the bed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio uses the opportunity to untie her own robe, but leaving it on as Agatha had chosen to. She then moves forwards, straddling Agatha's thighs and scraping the nails of her free hand over her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without breaking eye contact, Agatha grabs Rio's hand with hers, despite them being tied, and yanks it up to her mouth, taking one of her fingers in her mouth. Rio makes a mental note to never clean the blood off of her hands again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's eyes fall shut with a soft moan, swirling her tongue and sucking the blood off of Rio's fingers, one by one. Rio, though, watches her wife with parted lips, her chest heaving.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha's eyes open again. She takes the last of Rio's now clean fingers out of her mouth and takes a hold of the hand holding the knife. She waits for Rio to move it to her other hand before repeating the process with each finger.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once Rio's hands are no longer covered in blood, she grabs Agatha's hands and places them firmly above her head. Rio holds the knife with both hands and tilts it towards Agatha's mouth, asking the silent question of <em>clean up for me?</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But when Agatha's hands come back down from above her head and enclose around Rio's, she's too stunned to return them. She allows Agatha to tilt the knife further so that it's pointing directly at her mouth, before taking the knife <em>in her mouth.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio lets out a moan, her hips rocking a little, as she watches Agatha's lips enclose around the knife. She can see her tongue peek out occasionally as she licks it clean, and Rio can also see exactly how careful Agatha's being. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's keeping the sharp edge of the blade away from the corner of her lips, and opening her mouth before taking the knife a little deeper and closing it again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But Rio <em>needs</em> to fuck her. Maybe see <em>Agatha's</em> blood first. So, she gently pries one of her hands from Agatha's grasp, and takes a hold of her chin with two fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Open your mouth, baby, I don't want to cut your pretty mouth taking this out."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whines softly before complying, allowing Rio to pull the knife out from her mouth with a string of saliva connecting it to her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, please," Agatha breathes, lifting her hands to rest above her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trailing a finger down the edge of the blade, Rio asks, "Please what, mi amor?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans. "Make me bleed. Please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Biting her lip, Rio lays the knife at her sternum, pressing firm enough to feel the skin break but too light to produce blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sweetheart," Agatha whines breathily, "please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It seems to be enough for Rio, who presses the knife deep enough to make her bleed, slowly dragging it down the valley between her breasts. She places a firm hand on Agatha's ribs, stopping her from arching her back just to take the knife deeper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Baby," Agatha whimpers, pleading, "you don't need to be so gentle, I'll safeword if I need to."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Again, it's enough for Rio. Once she reaches Agatha's stomach, she presses deeper, causing a thick few drops of blood to cascade down her stomach, staining the bedsheets. Agatha releases a sound between a moan and a sob, but nods as she does so, telling Rio <em>I'm okay, keep going,</em> and thankful that Rio understands all of her little tells.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You love this, don't you?" Rio murmurs in a sultry, teasing tone, pausing with the knife for a moment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods helplessly, her chest heaving with anticipation and pure <em>need</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah? You love me using you like this, making you all pretty for me?" She grazes the knife lightly over the sides of her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes— yes, Rio." Agatha shivers, pressing her thighs together to attempt to gain even a little friction.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Be a good girl and tell me why, baby." She coos, slicing a little into the skin of Agatha's stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because—" She whimpers, clenching around nothing, "because I know what— what you're capable of but y—" Rio digs the knife ever so slightly deeper, bringing a needy whine from Agatha's lips, "you make me feel so fucking <em>good."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What am I capable of, Agatha?" She keeps the cuts shallow, slow, careful, constantly giving her the chance to safeword.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But she doesn't. Agatha's trembling and grasping the bedsheets as she speaks, "Killing me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Rio can't help but softly moan when the words land. <em>"Fuck..."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'd let you." Her eyebrows twitch a little, surprised by her own admission. "And I'd look so pretty for you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's almost forgotten that she's the one that's supposed to be in control here, too caught up in everything Agatha's saying. The work with the knife had stopped the moment Agatha said <em>killing me.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio takes in a breath trembling with need, and regains that control. "But if I killed you, mi cielito, I wouldn't be able to have my fun with you, would I? I wouldn't be able to make you feel good,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She reaches forwards with one of her fingers, collecting a drop of blood and slipping it between Agatha's parted lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Would I?" Rio continues.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes Agatha a moment to process everything Rio had said, too lost in the haze of her blood on her tongue, Rio's finger in her mouth. She shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good girl. I don't need to <em>kill you</em> to make you pretty for me, do I?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another shake of her head, this time paired with a desperate moan.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But I do <em>love</em> how desperate you are to please me." She husks, pulling her finger out from Agatha's mouth and runs that hand through her hair, tugging a little at her scalp.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And <em>fuck</em>, Agatha loves today's dynamic. She whimpers a little behind her closed mouth, looking up at Rio and fluttering her eyelashes with her best pleading eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's lips break into a smirk. "Use your words, pretty girl."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shudders, glancing down at the knife in Rio's hand. "Please keep going."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Keep going with what, mi amor?" She's playing, they both know it, especially when she traces her fingertips over the blade of the knife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Cut me. Make me pretty for you." Agatha breathes. "Please, <em>please</em>, my love."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Rio does exactly as she's begged to. Slowly, she holds the knife and presses it against Agatha's stomach, the coldness of the metal making her gasp.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Then</em>, she breaks the skin and drags the blade down her stomach. She keeps it shallow, regularly looking over and studying Agatha's face to ensure she won't pass out from either the pain or small blood loss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha releases a string of moans and whimpers with the sensation, the pain mixed with the pleasure. She tilts her head up a little to watch the knife work into her skin, cutting a few more careful lines into her stomach. A wave of pleasure rushes through her, furrowing her brows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She chuckles lightly in the haze of her pleasure. "My love, if you aren't care—careful, you're going to make me come just from— from this."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hm," Rio hums, "good to know."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And the next thing Agatha feels is the knife suddenly being pulled from her skin. She whines at the loss. "No, no, no, I didn't tell you to— <em>please</em> keep going."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Too bad. You want me to fuck you, don't you, pretty girl?" Rio holds the knife infront of her own mouth, trailing her tongue across the flat ends of it, cleaning it of the fresh blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods frantically in response.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Then lay still and let me clean you up."  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A sound of protest tumbles from Agatha's lips as she squeezes her eyes shut with desperation. "Rio, please—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh." And when Rio murmurs the sound, Agatha feels her breath on the skin of her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When she forces her eyes open, she realises she's done it just at the right time. Agatha watches as Rio leans closer to her stomach, breathing her in, before darting her tongue out and licking one of the trails of blood, leaving only a red smudge in it's place.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breathing has become more ragged, gasping and sighing as Rio's tongue drags across her stomach. She doesn't pass it directly over the wounds, not wanting to hurt her without being asked, and keeps to the splotches around them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Rio makes her way lower, catching the trickles that have made their way to the soft patches of skin between Agatha's thigh and hip. Rio quickly gives in to the impulse, hooking her arms around Agatha's thighs and sucking a mark into her skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She smiles against her hip at the sounds that it brings from Agatha, passing her tongue over the bruise to soothe it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha breathes, "please, angel."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A moan slips from Rio's mouth before she can catch herself, moving her head a little until she's level with Agatha's dripping centre. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She knew Agatha was soaked, but upon seeing it for herself, she immediately focuses on the task at hand, or rather, the task at <em>mouth</em>, and glides her tongue through her folds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hips involuntarily jerk into her as Rio's tongue brushes her clit, and Rio's quick to lay an arm over her wife's lower stomach, holding her down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes everything in Agatha to keep her hands above her head gripping the bedsheets, rather than reaching down and threading through Rio's hair. It only becomes harder to do so when Rio sucks her clit into her mouth, swirling her tongue perfectly and humming against her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>, that's— just like that," Agatha praises, arching into Rio's touch.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It draws a low moan from the back of Rio's throat, who dips a little lower and slides her tongue inside of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sudden feeling of Rio's tongue in her, combined with the way Rio's nose is pressing against her clit, has Agatha wrapping her legs more around Rio's head. Her ankles lock together and her heels dig into Rio's spine a little, and of course Agatha's still finding a way to hold her close with her hands tied.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Soon, Rio pulls her mouth away and replaces her tongue with two fingers, curling them right against Agatha's favourite spots. Just as Agatha's about to beg for Rio's mouth again, Rio pushes herself up her wife's body, keeping her fingers deep inside of her, and presses a messy kiss to her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands then come down from above her head, hooking around Rio's neck to pull her into deepening the kiss. Unfortunately, the kiss doesn't last very long once Agatha's head falls back with the pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her hold around the back of Rio's neck is strong enough to pull her to rest her head on Agatha's shoulder. Rio peppers soft kisses over the exposed skin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Moments later, Agatha's orgasm shoots through her, arching her back and moaning into the otherwise quiet room. "God, Rio— <em>fuck,"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once she's caught her breath and opened her eyes again, Agatha becomes suddenly aware that Rio hasn't got off. From what she can see, anyway. Rio's hips occasionally roll into Agatha, bringing soft sounds from her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, baby." Agatha's voice is raspy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio only hums in response, pressing her face more into Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can I have my hands back?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She grumbles, clearly reluctant to move. "Why?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Want you to ride my fingers." Agatha says, in that nonchalant yet desperate tone she does.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's head lifts almost immediately, her eyes wide and pupils dilated. "Okay." She says quietly, sitting up and untying the ribbon from Agatha's wrists.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her wife's hands swiftly reach to hold Rio's face, dragging her in for a kiss before pushing her to sit up again. She slides her left hand between Rio's legs, angling two fingers up ready for her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The moment Rio makes contact, they both whimper. Agatha feels Rio's wetness trickle down her fingers, to her wrist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Jesus</em>, Rio." She breathes, resting her other hand on Rio's hip. "You're dripping."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't even try to deny it, lowering herself fully onto Agatha's fingers. "You don't know how good you look right now."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another whimper tumbles from Agatha's lips. She angles her hand a little better so that her palm can press into Rio's clit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As soon as Rio starts moving, Agatha's breath hitches. She'll never tire of this feeling. "That's right, good girl."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio moans, each of her hands coming to grip Agatha's shoulders for support. "Fuck, I'm not— not gonna last,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can see that." Agatha can't resist teasing her a little. The moment Rio started moving, Agatha saw the signs. The slight shake in her legs, that little twitch her eyebrows do.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," She whines, squeezing her eyes shut with a groan.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You liked that, huh?" She coos. "You liked watching me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, clearly lost in her own pleasure but still taking in every word Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah? You saw how I slit her throat, how the blood hit me?" She keeps her voice soft and gentle, contrast to the words themselves.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, cariño, <em>fuck,"</em> Rio's body tenses, falling forwards with her forehead resting on Agatha's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So beautiful," Agatha muses, "such a good girl for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio breathes out a relieved moan, lifting herself from Agatha's fingers and then resuming her position laying ontop of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha manages to convince Rio to stay for five minutes before she lets herself get dragged off to the shower. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The water's warm, and Rio places a hand at the small of her back, guiding her underneath the water.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This is gonna sting a little." She warns, just before Agatha steps below the water. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She winces when the water passes over the cuts on her chest and stomach, tensing her body.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, it's okay. Relax." She runs her hands up and down Agatha's sides, waiting until she feels the muscles relax before grabbing a washcloth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're right, it stings like a bitch." Agatha grumbles, but laughs lightly, running a hand through her now wet hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio softly chuckles, squeezing a little body wash on the cloth. "Can I?" She asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, taking a step closer to her wife. She lets Rio wipe clean any stains of blood on her flesh, as much as they both might <em>like</em> it. It's almost too much, the amount of care Rio's laying on her, it doesn't feel deserved considering what had happened a couple hours ago.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha knows it, Rio's washed her hair, cleaned herself and is taking Agatha out of the shower. Rio helps to dry Agatha's body, sensing that she feels a little out of it with the rush of so many emotions.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha welcomes it, allowing Rio to dress her with a green flannel and pair of comfy shorts. She lets Rio bandage and treat her wounds, lets her braid her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the time they're laying in bed again, dressed and clean, it's about midday. Rio's managed to convince Agatha to have a <em>movie day in bed</em>, but it's only really to try to distract Agatha's mind from the morning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio figures that when Agatha actually processes it all, it's going to be a lot. So, for now, she does the best she can, which happens to be keeping Agatha upstairs and away from the bloody floors and walls for as long as possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's aware that Agatha knows she killed Evanora. It's not like her mind's blocked it out completely— it's just that she hasn't seemed to fully take it in. Sure, Agatha had said the words herself— <em>I fucking killed her, Rio—</em> but, logically, Agatha can't be this calm about it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They've both, especially Agatha, wanted Evanora dead for years. Rio assumes that Agatha's just avoiding the inevitable realisation, the breakdown. She assumes that Agatha knows what Rio's trying to do and is allowing herself to get whisked away in Rio's care. Allowing herself to forget for a few hours.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's plan is to clean up downstairs and dispose of the body after Agatha falls asleep that night, then to talk about it the following morning. It's going surprisingly well, until Agatha's stomach rumbles rather loudly, breaking them both from the little bubble they had created.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'll bring us some lunch." Rio says, sitting up and making her way to the door of their bedroom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Up here?" Agatha frowns. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Rio worries she's going to have to explain why she keeps insisting Agatha stays up here, but it quickly dissipates when Agatha continues.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But what if we make a mess of the bed?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, a soft, warm sound. "Baby, it's covered in blood and come— I don't think a few crumbs are going to be a problem."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Aagtha just stares at her, her lips curling into a small smile of her own.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I was going to wash them later, anyway." Rio shrugs, before opening the door and leaving to get some food.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And that night, Agatha falls asleep much earlier than she usually would have, physically and mentally exhausted from the day, in Rio's arms.</p>

<p>When Agatha wakes up, she's surprised to see that the room is still pitch black. However, what surprises her more is the fact that she can't feel Rio. Her arm stretches across the bed, just to find a patch of nothing beside her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She sits up and rubs her eyes, checking the time on her phone. Two in the morning. Agatha exhales shakily, the panic of waking up alone, after what happened yesterday, starting to set in.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Quickly, she flicks on a lamp and gets to her feet, throwing on the green flannel from yesterday. She then quietly opens the bedroom door and treads lightly downstairs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There's a faint sound coming from the kitchen, calming Agatha's nerves a little, but as she stands in the doorway of the kitchen, she sees Rio holding a carving knife. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her breath hitches. "What are you—" She catches sight of the deformed body laid out on the island in the middle of the room, "oh."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio spins on her feet, looking at Agatha with shock, and just a sprinkle of worry.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You scared me." Agatha continues, muttering just loud enough for her wife to hear. "I thought you... left."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's face falls a little. "I— sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to—" She gestures to the body behind her, "I just wanted to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you need help?" Agatha cuts in, taking a few steps further into the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Help?" Rio frowns. "No— Agatha, you need to sleep."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want to help." She leans on the wall. <em>"I</em> did it, I should...help. I won't be able to get back to sleep anyway, if you aren't there."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Rio sighs and steps forwards, landing a hand on Agatha's shoulder and taking her to the kitchen island.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under her hand, she can feel Agatha tense when she takes in the body. When she looks over, Agatha has her arms crossed with her fingers curling tightly into the fabric of her shirt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio starts softly, "You don't have to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." She takes a deep breath. "What do you need me to do?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hands her carving knife to Agatha, then gets another one to use for herself. Then, she lays a hand over the one her wife is holding the knife with, and guides it to the body's arm. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, I just need to...chop it up?" She asks, trying to give her voice a bit of an amused lilt, but it just comes out trembling.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. Makes it easier to cremate." Rio says. "I'll do the other side, just follow what I'm doing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, exhaling shakily at the loss of contact brought by Rio moving to the other side of the island.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Try not to think of it as...a body." Rio adds awkwardly, catching the hesitant look on Agatha's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Kind of hard to do that when I'm about to chop an obviously human arm up." She frowns, breathing through her mouth to inhale as little of the dead body smell as possible.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Right, yeah— sorry." Rio shakes her head, then wedges the carving knife into the body's elbow, cutting the forearm off.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches, then tries to do it herself. She re-establishes her grip on the knife, then reaches to hold the body's arm for stability. It's so <em>cold</em> that she flinches, pulling her hand back, then slowly placing it down again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha pushes the carving knife into the body's opposite elbow, she looks away to the floor, not wanting to see it. But she can feel the blood seeping out, and barely holds back a gag.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Chopping a dead body up is <em>much</em> worse and much more tedious than the actual killing. Agatha isn't sure how Rio's able to just <em>do it</em>, to just cut it up like it's a regular piece of meat, and <em>not</em> a human body.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We'll have to cut at the shoulder too. The more parts, the quicker the cremation." Rio says casually, then makes a small incision at the shoulder before chopping the whole way through.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't reply, just follows Rio's actions and trying to ignore the growing uncomfortable knots in her stomach. Maybe she should have just listened to Rio and went back to bed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Next, Agatha watches as Rio chops just below the body's knee, it's shin jerking with the force of it. That seems to be what does it— she quickly moves to the sink, wretching and coughing the vomit into it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels Rio's hands in her hair, holding it back and gently scratching at her scalp.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I've got you." Rio says softly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Groaning with frustration, Agatha reaches forwards and turns on the tap, rinsing her hands of the blood and cupping some water into them, taking it in her mouth and spitting it out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She stays leaning over the sink for a few moments, clutching at her own stomach with one hand, and finally allows herself to cry.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>There it is</em>, Rio thinks to herself. She just holds her wife, wrapping an arm around her waist and stroking through her hair. "Breathe, it's okay, I'm here."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It just hit me." Agatha sighs, her breath coming in short gasps. "I— I fucking did that, Rio, I <em>killed her</em>. It felt <em>good."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know, baby, it's okay. Come here." She tries to turn Agatha around by her shoulders, but she's stopped by more gagging and wretching into the sink. "Okay— it's alright, cariño."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio rubs up and down her spine to provide a little comfort, waiting for Agatha to rinse her hands and mouth again. Before putting her blood-stained hands back on Agatha, Rio also rinses her hands, not wanting to ruin her clothes more than she already has.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How the fuck do you deal with cleaning up all the time?" Agatha's throat is sore as she speaks. Instead of waiting for Rio to reply, she turns around and wraps her arms around her waist, buring her face in the crook of her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sort of used to it by now." Rio mumbles, combing her fingers through Agatha's hair, who hums in response, silently crying into her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You don't need to be here, y'know?" Rio reminds her. "You can go wait upstairs."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And when Agatha's voice comes, it's small and vulnerable. "I don't want to be alone right now."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay," Rio nods, "okay. But you really don't need to help me if—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, let me help. I want to help you." She insists.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reluctantly, Rio agrees, kissing her hairline. She doesn't like that Agatha's practically forcing herself to do something she clearly doesn't want to do, just to help Rio when she doesn't <em>need</em> the help.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, it doesn't take much longer and Agatha's somewhat managed to keep herself together. That changes, however, when the body itself has been cremated and Rio collects the ashes in a ziplock bag and turns to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha has her arms wrapped around herself in a small hug, her brows furrowed and biting her lip, as if she's trying to stop herself from crying.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We can do whatever you want with them." She says, handing the bag of ashes to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a deep, shaking breath, Agatha takes it and just stares for a minute. Her face relaxes a little, but a few small tears have started to fall.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bury them?" Agatha suggests, shrugging.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods. "Of course." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And so, illuminated by only the moonlight, Rio digs a small hole with their shovel and sits beside it, allowing Agatha to make the final move. But, all she does is sit beside Rio on the moss and rests her head on her shoulder, keeping a tight hold on the ziplock bag.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes her just over ten minutes to actually pour the ashes in the mud. They don't say anything as Agatha pushes all of the dirt back in, covering the ashes and patting it down like nothing happened.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha lays her head back on Rio's shoulder and takes one of her hands, playing with it in her lap. They sit for another five minutes in silence, and Rio's more than happy to give her wife all the time she needs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, it's Agatha who takes Rio back inside, insisting that they need to get all of the blood cleaned up and <em>spray some air freshener because it smells like some fucker's died.</em> She isn't wrong.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio isn't surprised however, that this is now how Agatha's acting. Like nothing's happened. Like she hadn't just murdered her mother, chopped up the body and buried the ashes. Like everything's okay.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before saying anything though, Rio talks her through how she'd usually clean all of the blood up, and as she expected, Agatha just follows through without a word.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It hurts seeing her like this. So, as they work on cleaning the blood on opposite sides of the kitchen island, Rio speaks up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's okay to be sad, y'know?" She says, glancing up at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Agatha nods, continuing to scrub the blood away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Though, she looks like she has more to say, so Rio stays quiet and lets her think through her words in her head. She's known her long enough to catch all of her tells with difficult conversations.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instead of pushing her to talk, Rio allows her to do it in her own time and wipes some more blood away. Out of her peripheral, she can see that Agatha's stopped cleaning, that she's leaning into the counter and squeezing her eyes shut.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't mention it. She doesn't want Agatha to feel pressured, to feel like she <em>has</em> to talk. All she does is stay in the same room, near her, and stays quiet, so that Agatha knows Rio's here when she wants to talk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha clears her throat and moves into the hallway. She starts to clean the blood from the floor, and <em>fuck</em>, there's so much blood in the hallway. Rio quickly finishes in the kitchen and follows to help her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio kneels down a few feet from her wife, spraying the floor with the cleaning product and wiping the blood away. The rug, though, they unfortunately can't do anything with except throw it away. It's been far too long to even hope that the stain would wash out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Clearing her throat again, Agatha leans against the wall and drops her head against it. "Is it bad if I say I'm glad she's dead?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not at all, querida." Rio says. "She was a cunt, she had it coming."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs a watery laugh, holding her hand out for Rio to hold, who does so quickly, sliding across the floor to sit beside Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Honestly, if <em>you</em> didn't do it, <em>I</em> might have."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I wouldn't have stopped you." Agatha mutters, leaning her head against Rio's shoulder for the countless time that night.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio feels that now is the best time to ask. "How are you feeling?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know." Okay, so that's <em>just</em> what Rio expected. That's okay. It's how <em>she</em> felt six years ago after her first victim.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's okay." Rio rubs her thumb over Agatha's knuckles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How did you feel the first time?" She asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath catches. She didn't expect that. "Not sure." She says, then continues. "Overwhelmed. A little scared, and <em>definitely</em> ashamed at how good it felt."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, humming. "Yeah. That sounds about right."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It'll pass."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She hums again, leaning into Rio more.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're tired." Rio points out. "Go to bed, let me finish this up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs lightly, a soft little sound. "I already told you, I won't be able to sleep if you aren't there." Then, a little quieter, "Especially tonight."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. I won't be long." Rio lands a kiss to the top of her head before pulling away, grabbing the wipes again and working at the floor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't help this time— just watching. She takes in the sight of her wife, putting in this much care and effort for her, cleaning up her mess. Her wife, who hasn't left, despite everything.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Maybe this is how Rio feels when she looks at me</em>. Agatha accidentally hums audibly with the thought, bringing her knees up to her chest and resting her chin there.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What?" Rio looks up at her, her eyes a little wider.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles. "Nothing. You're just...beautiful." She shrugs, sighing. "I love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you, too, mi amor." Rio replies sweetly, getting back to the task at hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes about fifteen minutes for Rio to clean the floorboards. When she glances back up at Agatha, about to tell her she's done, she sees that she's drifted to sleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A smile tugs on her lips, reaching her hand out to brush her fingers over Agatha's cheek. "Hey, let's go to bed, okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, but leans into Rio's touch. "You're done?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"All done." Rio nods, taking a hold of Agatha's hand as she stands up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls herself up with Rio's hold and impatiently drags her up to their bedroom. She quickly removes the flannel, so that she's just wearing a white vest and underwear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Growing more desperate to get in bed and hold Rio until they fall asleep, Agatha undresses Rio, leaving her in a vest of her own and a pair of boxers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her hand drifts over Rio's waist before she grabs her hand and pulls her into bed, beneath the covers. As she gets comfortable, with Rio on her back and with Agatha resting her head on her chest, she whimpers a little, involuntarily.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You okay?" Rio mistakes it for a sound of discomfort.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"More than." She mumbles, hooking a leg over Rio's hips. "Thank you for tonight, sweetheart."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're very welcome, mi vida." Her hand reaches out to tuck some of Agatha's hair behind her ear, while the other wraps around her and rubs a comforting hand on her back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's arm comes to curl around Rio's waist, her hand tucking beneath her vest to feel the relaxing warmth of her skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not going anywhere." Rio says, leaning her head on Agatha's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows why Rio says it, knows that Rio can see that she's still a little worried. "Promise?" She asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Promise. Go to sleep, mi amor." She replies gently.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha breathes out a relieved <em>okay, goodnight, my love</em> and lets herself relax. She falls asleep within minutes in Rio's arms.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stays awake a little longer though, thinking over the last hour, how Agatha handled it. It was, honestly, much better than Rio had anticipated. She was expecting a full blown panic attack, shaking and sobbing on the floor, but that's not what happened at all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite Agatha not explicitly saying the words, Rio can tell she feels as if she lost some control when she killed Evanora. She assumes it's why Agatha's kept herself together so well. To regain control.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A part of her wants to help her to just let go, to let herself <em>feel</em>, but she wants Agatha to be comfortable. So, Rio lets her wife hold her while she sleeps, she lets her bury the ashes of a woman they both <em>hated</em>, and she lets her help with cleaning up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio sighs, trying to fight against the onslaught of her mind. She relaxes more comfortably into the mattress, turning a little so that she can hold Agatha more firmly and intertwine their legs beneath the duvet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And now, with her wife's breath rhythmically fanning over her neck, her arms around her, Rio manages to succumb to sleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This time, when Agatha stirs, she's met with the familiar warmth of Rio's body pressed against her own. She groans and nuzzles a little closer, still half-asleep, and feels Rio laugh quietly beside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hi." Rio strokes a hand through her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at her. "Hi."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sleep well?" She asks, her gaze flicking down to her wife's lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Catching this, Agatha nods and lets her mouth curl into a smile. "You're staring."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How can I not when my wife is so beautiful?" Rio places a hand on her cheek, running her thumb over her cheekbone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha suddenly leans in, wrapping her hands around the back of Rio's neck and closing the distance between them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Their lips come together softly, gently, an unspoken <em>thank you</em> and <em>you're welcome</em> for the last twenty-four hours.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shuffles a little closer, her hair splaying out beneath her as she tilts her head slightly, deepening the kiss just so. With the new angle, Agatha slips her tongue between Rio's parted lips, whimpering when it makes contact with Rio's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha moves one of her arms down to Rio's waist, pulling her closer so that one of her legs fall between Agatha's, who moans softly into Rio's mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a firm grip on Rio's chin, she pulls away for a moment. "I was thinking."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Uh-huh." Rio says mindlessly, running a hand up and down Agatha's side while the other plays with her hair. <em>Fuck</em>, she can't believe they're married, even after eight and a half years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's hot that you're still here after yesterday." She states, her voice practically a purr.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" A playful smile grows on Rio's lips. "Welcome to my world, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites at her lip, tilting Rio's head up and forcing her to meet her gaze. She continues, "And it's gotten me <em>incredibly</em> wet this morning. Care to help me out, my love?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A low whimper drops from Rio's lips, grabbing Agatha's hips and finding the waistband of her underwear, tugging them down her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a quiet gasp and chuckles softly at the desperation of it. "Is that a yes?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." Rio nods, pulling her closer until she's straddling a thigh, the wetness between her legs immediately coating it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha curls her hands into Rio's hair and leans forwards, kissing her deeply and moaning against her lips. Pushing her thigh up more into Agatha, Rio guides her to grind down, pulling and pushing her across her leg.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Huffing a breathy moan into Rio's mouth, Agatha breaks the kiss to look Rio in the eye despite her struggle to keep her eyes from fluttering closed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're so fucking pretty." Rio murmurs, tracing the line of Agatha's jaw with her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck," Agatha's head drops to rest on Rio's forehead, nudging their noses together as she does so.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So good for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fingers—" She whimpers, "your fingers, Rio, I need— <em>please."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And who is Rio to deny her wife such pleasure? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The moment two of Rio's fingers slip inside of her, she releases a relieved moan, her head dropping into the crook of Rio's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio curls her fingers against the sweet spot inside of her, allowing Agatha to continue rolling her hips at her own pace, pressing her clit into her wife's palm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's perf—perfect—" Agatha chokes out a moan, "you feel <em>so good,</em> sugar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers in response, adding a third finger, and stretching her deliciously, almost painfully. It heightens Agatha's pleasure until it's almost overwhelming, her hips losing their rhythm. Her lips are parted against Rio's shoulder, pressing the occasional open-mouthed kiss to her flesh, grazing her teeth over it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What actually pushes Agatha over the edge, though, is when Rio scrapes her blunt nails from Agatha's scalp to her lower back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's it, baby, there you go." Rio coos, holding her close and guiding her hips to help her ride out her orgasm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my— <em>fuck, Rio,"</em> A long, low moan falls from her lips, her body relaxing against Rio's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can you go again?" Rio asks, then follows it up with, "You're so fucking gorgeous when you come."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How about you fuck me and find out?" She says with a teasing lilt in her tone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Rio is <em>absolutely</em> going to find out— she takes a hold of Agatha's waist with her free hand and flips her onto her back, keeping her fingers knuckle deep inside of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, you're so beautiful." Agatha husks, then pulls Rio in by her hair and locking their lips. "I love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you," Rio leans down and mouths across Agatha's neck, "so much."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She then starts to pump her fingers again, reveling in the whimper that it pulls from the back of Agatha's throat. The movement stays slow and gentle, just coaxing the high out of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls back from Agatha's neck, landing deep, tender kisses to her lips. With each thrust, Rio curls her fingers, manoeuvring her thumb to press into her clit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Considering how sensitive Agatha already is from her last climax, it doesn't take long for Rio to push her over the edge once more, working her through it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"God</em>, Ri, you— fuck," Agatha arches her back, crying out into their room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So beautiful." Rio breathes, peppering kisses all over Agatha's face, causing her to break out into soft laughter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," She chuckles, "baby."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans back, sitting back over Agatha's thighs, a smile playing on her lips. "What?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come here," She tugs Rio by her hips, trying to make it clear what she's asking for without saying the words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come where?" Rio teases, furrowing her brows and feigning confusion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"On my face, Rio. Sit on my face." She says dryly, but the way her face is flushed betrays her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well, if you insist, mi amor." She shuffles upwards, bracketing her thighs over Agatha's head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Impatiently, Agatha grabs Rio's thighs and pulls her own onto her mouth, flattening her tongue and gliding through her folds, flicking her clit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She smirks against her wife at the gasp it brings, the way one of Rio's hands reaches out to grab the headboard while the other grips Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Humming with the taste of her, Agatha slides her tongue inside of her, delighting in the way Rio instinctively grinds her hips down, nudging her clit against Agatha's nose. Rio moans breathily, high pitched, her head dropping to rest against the wall.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, fuck— <em>Agatha,"</em> She whines desperately.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls Rio further down, allowing her to rest almost her full weight on her. She thrusts her tongue, licking up Rio's desire and presses her nose harder into Rio's clit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And when Rio looks down, seeing the way Agatha's face is shiny with her arousal, she clenches around Agatha's tongue, feeling herself grow closer and closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ag— cariño, I'm—" Her words are interrupted by her own moans, <em>"fuck</em>, you feel so good."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha moves one of her hands round to the small of her wife's back, pulling her to grind down more onto her, to help herself along to her orgasm. Rio complies, losing herself in the sensation of Agatha's mouth, the sound of her little moans with each thrust of her tongue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio's climax hits her, she throws her head back, grabbing one of Agatha's thighs behind her so that she doesn't fall over. She rides out her orgasm, then lifts her hips a little and slowly shuffles back down Agatha's body while she catches her breath.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her in to lay more comfortably ontop of her, wrapping her arms around her back. They lay there for a few moments, listening to the sound of the other's breathing, or caressing eachother's skin despite it being sticky with sweat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio rolls over to lay on her back beside Agatha, taking one of her hands and holding it in her lap. "How are you feeling?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're not talking about the sex, are you?" Agatha sighs, a small smile tugging at her lips as she glances at her wife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, now holding Agatha's hand with both of her own.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm...okay." Agatha says slowly, unsure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A slightly awkward silence follows as Rio waits patiently for Agatha to elaborate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's a lot to...take in." She then says. "I don't care that I killed her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But?" Rio asks, sensing there was one coming.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But, I— she's gone, Rio. She's... really <em>gone."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you...happy?" Rio asks carefully.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes. I'm glad I did it. Not sure why it took me so long, I've thought about it my whole life."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath hitches. "By <em>it</em> you mean killing <em>her specifically</em>, right?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not so sure anymore." Agatha murmurs. "Maybe. Maybe not."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." She takes a deep breath, exhaling audibly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns to her side to face her, placing a hand on her cheek. "You didn't break me, Rio. You didn't...influence me to kill her. You didn't make me do it. Okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods slowly, nervously chewing at the inside of her cheek.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My love. You didn't ruin my life. I'm okay, I'm not going to spiral. Everything's okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know that it is." Rio mutters, looking everywhere but Agatha's eyes. She elaborates before her wife can ask her to, "I've never killed anyone that I have some sort of connection to."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns. "What are you saying?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm saying that I'm scared this is going to get traced back to us." She forces the words out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha sighs, <em>"you</em> didn't kill her, I did. Even if it does, then I'll—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't." Her voice breaks. "No. I'm not losing you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels as if her heart's fallen apart. "Sweetheart, I'm not going to let you get arrested for something you didn't do."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's not fair if you get arrested. Not fair on you, not fair on me. I've killed<em> so many people</em>, Agatha, if <em>you</em> got arrested, I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, listen to me. Neither of us are getting arrested. We're going to be okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You don't know that." Her eyes gloss over with tears.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, I don't," Agatha sighs, taking a slow blink, "but we don't need to spiral about things that aren't happening."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs, looking up at the ceiling. Agatha's right. "I'm just scared."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And that's okay. So am I." She says gently. "But we were careful. Besides, her friends don't know I exist, she was <em>way</em> too ashamed of me for that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns. She's right <em>again</em>. Evanora would always tell her friends she was just simply going for a walk, not going out to insult her daughter. She kept Agatha hidden.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"They don't know I exist." Agatha repeats. "If police were to go to them, none of the potential leads would be about <em>us</em>, okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head. "But the <em>police</em> know you exist."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If the police came to us, then we tell them we haven't seen my mother since we got married. She never texted me, you know that, baby. She would just show up. There's no way to prove that we'd be lying if we said we haven't seen her in eight years."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Rio nods, swallowing. "You're right."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We were careful. It'll be okay." She shuffles a little closer and pulls Rio into her arms, wrapping her in a reassuring hug.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They fall into a comfortable silence, Rio's head resting on Agatha's chest while she plays with her hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You think we'd get invited to the funeral?" Rio suddenly asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs a laugh. "Doubt it. But, hey, that would be fun right? I could do a eulogy and tell everyone what a cunt she was."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, sitting up and looking down at her. "Please, you'd make it so obvious that you killed her. You'd probably brag about it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I would not." She argues, but the smile forming on her face has them both thinking otherwise. "Okay, fine, I would. But even if we<em> were</em> invited to the funeral, there's no way in hell we'd go."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well," Rio lays back down, leaning into Agatha. "Hypothetically, we'd probably have to. Otherwise it would look bad."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hypothetically," Agatha parrots, "we'll cross that bridge if we ever get to it, my love."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hums in response, curling into her more firmly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wait—" She frowns, "what time is it? Don't you have work?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." Rio shakes her head. "I'm taking the day off. I want to be home with you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You don't have to take the day off for me, darling. I was going to write today."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You can still write." Rio says. "I just wanted to be here incase you need me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her for a moment before sighing. "God, I love you so much."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you, too, mi vida." She leans forwards and kisses her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As it turns out, Agatha spends the majority of the day in her office, tapping away on the keyboard. Rio takes very quick notice that there's a <em>lot</em> of tapping, and no signs of her getting frustrated and thudding her head on the desk. So, she assumes it's going well.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio mainly just leaves her to it, but her curiosity gets the better of her when it reaches the fourth hour that Agatha's been sat writing. She stands outside the door to her office for a moment, listening for any sign that she shouldn't enter, a sign that Agatha would want to be alone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When no sign comes, she knocks on the door and enters once she hears Agatha mutter a <em>come in, sweetheart</em> from inside.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hi." Agatha turns in her chair and greets her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio walks in and stands behind her, placing her hands on her shoulders. "Hi."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you alright, my love?" She asks, leaning her head back so she can look at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. How's the writing going?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks back at the computer screen. "Uh— I— good. It's good." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can I read it?" She asks, cupping Agatha's jaw.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— you—" She clears her throat, her cheeks flushing a little, "mhm. Go ahead."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio lands her hands back on Agatha's shoulders, absentmindedly massaging the muscles as she leans forwards to see the poem clearly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<u>
<em>Love me</em>
</u>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hold me with the hands</em>
</p><p>
<em>you used to bury them in the sands,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Enchant me with your eyes;</em>
</p><p>
<em>the warmth of a thousand flames</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Thrill me with your speech</em>
</p><p>
<em>and I'll beg for you to teach,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Fluster me with your gaze</em>
</p><p>
<em>and set my desire ablaze</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Kiss me with your soft lips</em>
</p><p>
<em>which you know I can't resist,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Take me for your own</em>
</p><p>
<em>and I'll see your pupils blown</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Love me like you've never before;</em>
</p><p>
<em>I've become a sucker for your gore,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me like you hate me</em>
</p><p>
<em>just to see me bleed</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Kill me with the only knife</em>
</p><p>
<em>you'd wish to use on</em>
</p><p>
<em>your wife</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio clears her throat. Then rereads it. And then reads it again. "That's— fuck, that's really good."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha looks up at her, placing her hands on Rio's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her voice wavers a little when she asks, "Is it about me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Who else would it be about?" She chuckles, reaching up and tracing Rio's bottom lip. "I was right, your lips <em>are</em> soft."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio presses a kiss to the pad of her thumb before taking a hold of her hand, lacing their fingers together. "Are you going to publish it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wanted your opinion first." She admits. "Do you think it's too murdery?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio circles the chair and kneels down infront of Agatha, placing her hands on her knees. She almost laughs at the way her wife's legs spread a little on instinct, the way she bites at her lip and how her hands clench at her sides.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I think it's perfect, mi corazón." Rio says, spreading Agatha's legs a little further and resting her head against her inner thigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha's words are breathy, needy within five minutes of having Rio's hands on her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I think <em>you're</em> perfect." She leans up and wraps her arms around Agatha's lower back, pulling her so that her core is flush with her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers at the pressure despite it being so muted through her jeans. "Rio,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You want to know what my favourite part was?" She grabs Agatha by the back of her neck and pulls her down so that their lips are brushing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just nods, her hands coming down to cup Rio's jaw.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Take me for your own and I'll see your pupils blown."</em> Rio recites the lines from memory, her pupils dilating just as the line suggests. <em>"Love me like you've never before; I've become a sucker for your gore. Fuck me like you hate me just to see me bleed."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath catches, involuntarily releasing a whimper. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You want me to <em>take you</em>, Agatha?" She asks, standing up between her wife's legs and cupping her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods quickly, her eyebrows pulling together in anticipation. "Yes."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me what you want me to do, cariño."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she opens her mouth to speak, Rio slides her hands into her hair, tugging to break her sentence. "Fuck— fuck me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio tugs a little harder, pulling Agatha up to her feet and slowly walking her towards the door of her office. "Fuck you how, pretty girl?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whines, her hands coming up to tightly grip Rio's waist. "With— with the strap." She breathes, "Hands and knees."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Look at you, working yourself up over a beautiful but <em>dirty</em> little poem." She coos, guiding Agatha backwards through the house.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It isn't only me though, is it?" Agatha counters with a knowing smile, pulling Rio close enough so that they're almost completely pressed together. "I know you're soaked underneath this little act you're putting on."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They reach the bedroom, and Rio pushes Agatha up against the wall, leaving her breathless with her chest heaving. Rio chuckles lightly and shakes her head. "You're right. I'm <em>soaked</em>, and I desperately need to fuck you, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers, her eyes slipping shut. When she opens them again, Rio's looking at her with such pure need that she feels as if she's going to melt on the spot.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Will you let me do that?" Her words are soft but trembling, close enough to Agatha that she can feel her breath on her skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Please."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The moment the word is uttered, Rio pulls Agatha from the wall and walks her over to the bed, pushing her down onto her back. "Hands and knees. Take your clothes off."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scrambles to do as she says, unaware of how hastily Rio's removing her own clothes and how quickly she's brought the strap up her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha feels the mattress dip behind her, her legs automatically spread a little, for Rio to kneel in the space provided. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Then</em>, Agatha feels Rio's hands on her back. They draw long paths up and down her spine, digging her nails in slightly as she does so.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She groans, her head falling forwards with her fair framing her face. "Rio,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know, baby." A pause, and Agatha can <em>hear</em> Rio reaching between her own legs and collecting some arousal on her fingers, wiping it over the toy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck,"</em> Agatha whimpers under her breath, subconsciously spreading her legs a little further.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha then feels one of Rio's hands on her hip, and assumes the other is positioning the strap correctly after she feels it tease at her entrance.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You look so beautiful like this." Rio murmurs, taking her bottom lip between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs a broken but amused laugh. "I'll look even more beautiful when I'm stretched out for you, when I come for you, when I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes the strap into her in one clean thrust, leaving Agatha's sentence to trail into a needy whine. Her elbows buckle, leaving her to lean on her forearms, her hands fisting into the sheets.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What were you saying?" Rio teases, threading a hand into Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, her forehead dropping and making contact with the mattress. "Fuck off," </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh?" Rio slowly starts to pull out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, no, no— wait, wait—" She rambles, but Rio doesn't stop just yet. Agatha knows what her wife is waiting for. "Fuck, <em>please."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses with about an inch of the strap left inside of her, tugging at Agatha's hair a little as she asks, "Please, what, mi amor?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You know what." Agatha responds, her voice cracking with her desperation. But Rio pulls out just a little more—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, fine—" Agatha groans, "please fuck me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There we go." Rio coos, then thrusts into her, their skin smacking together with the force of it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Oh, fuck</em>— God, Rio," She chokes out a strangled moan, her head falling back into the mattress as Rio releases her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The pace stays slow but <em>deep and hard,</em> each pump of Rio's hips bringing a needy little moan from Agatha's lips. It's not enough for her and they both know it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha isn't going to give Rio the pleasure of hearing her beg too much, not today at least.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So instead, Agatha needs to regain control. "You're— fuck, you're doing so good, my love."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She smirks into the bed when she feels Rio's movements falter a little, when she hears her whimper. The praise has always been Rio's weak spot, and Agatha <em>loves</em> to take advantage of it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You always fuck me just— just right, Ri." She pushes the words out despite how difficult it is when Rio's thrusts somehow get even deeper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck," Rio breathes out from behind her, Agatha's words clearly getting to her. The way the strap is nudging against her clit certainly isn't helping, either.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After hearing how worked up Rio is, Agatha tries her luck with a strained, "Faster, Rio,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You think you're the one in control here?" She releases a small, mocking laugh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, please, I've been in control since you read the poem and you know it." She scoffs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio goes quiet for a moment, essentially proving her right. Her hips slow to a stop inside of her as she tries to pull herself together, tries to regain her control.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come on, sweetheart," Agatha says in that honeyed sultry tone she knows Rio can't resist, "don't you want to make me feel good? Don't you want to be good for me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck." This time, Rio says it with a more irritated sigh, as if she's accepting defeat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Baby," Agatha turns her head just enough to catch Rio's eye, her eyebrows forming a pleading frown when she says, <em>"please?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And upon seeing the look on Rio's face, Agatha knows she's won. She twitches her eyebrows in a way that reiterates her words to Rio, who flutters her eyes shut with a sigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Seeing how desperately Rio's trying to keep her control, Agatha resorts to the thing that'll give Rio the last little push. "Te necesito tanto."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just about sees Rio's eyes darken, feeling the strap get pushed a little deeper out of Rio's control. <em>Almost there.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Por favor fóllame."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hips suddenly push forwards, the strap reaching spots Agatha swears they've never reached before. Dropping her head back onto the mattress, Agatha tightens her grip on the sheets, her mouth falling open with a moan.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>— good girl, you're su—such a <em>good girl</em>, Rio." Agatha's sentence is broken with moans and whimpers due to Rio's now relentless pace with her hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't respond with words, but her moans grow a little louder as she adjusts the angle of her hips, hitting the perfect spots within Agatha simultaneous to the base of the toy rubbing perfectly against her hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want—" Agatha's cut off with yet another one of her moans, "want you to come inside me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lost in the pleasure coupled with Agatha's words, Rio thrusts deeper, faster, gaining more friction on her own clit as an attempt to fulfill Agatha's request.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can you do that for me, baby?" She asks, her voice breathy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm— yeah, <em>fuck,"</em> The pressure between her legs builds gradually, working herself to her orgasm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel herself clench around the toy, her legs shaking slightly and her back arching. Though, she holds off her climax for a few incredibly difficult moments, waiting until Rio's thrusts become more uneven, stuttering.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And the moment that happens, she forces out the words right before she lets herself come undone. "Come— come for me, Rio. Please— <em>fuck,"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Rio does— she cries out and fucks Agatha through both of their highs, draining every little bit of pleasure out of them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once their moans have subsided into soft whimpers, Rio gently pulls out. The moment she does, Agatha lays down and rolls onto her back, her arms stretched out above her head. Rio takes off the harness from her hips before doing the same, laying beside Agatha and hooking a leg over her waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Jesus Christ." Agatha huffs a laugh. "How the fuck are you so good at that?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hums, tracing softly over the healing, bandaged cuts across Agatha's torso. "I must be a natural."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You must be."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They fall into a comfortable silence. Agatha's slowly lacing her fingers through Rio's hair, while Rio curls up so close to her they practically become one.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's the first to break it. "What are you thinking about?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How good our sex is." Rio mutters, smiling against Agatha's skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, but she knows a lie from her wife when she hears one. "No, you're not."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, I'm not." Rio reluctantly sighs. She stays beside Agatha though, still tracing imaginary shapes into her skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is it?" Agatha asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm just...glad it's you." She closes her eyes, nuzzling further into Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns. "Glad what's me?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My wife." Rio says, then elaborates. "My perfect wife. You...still love me. Still trust me after <em>everything."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course I do." She shrugs. "Incase you've forgotten, I killed my mother yesterday, I'm not exactly in a place to judge you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It earns her a small laugh, followed by a playful swat on her stomach. "I know. But before that. I didn't know how you'd react but <em>now</em>, I feel closer to you than ever."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So do I, my love," Agatha says, then repeats in a whisper, "so do I."</p>

<p>The invite to Evanora's funeral comes as a surprise to both of them. About a month since the murder, they had been sitting together of the sofa, mindlessly watching some TV, when they heard some sort of envelope drop through their letterbox.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns, reluctantly getting up from Rio's hold and walking over to the door, kneeling down and picking it up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She opens it, and sees a card with a typical floral border, and in large cursive letters:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>Celebrating the life of Evanora Harkness</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pauses. She reads through the whole thing, the dates of her birth and death, the date of the funeral service, the time, the address. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And <em>then</em> she looks at the photo of her mother. The smug fucking smile on her face like she knew exactly how Agatha would feel recieving an invitation. Like she knew she still had control over her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is it?" Rio calls out from the living room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha strolls back to her, resisting the urge to rip the invitation up and burn it to ash. She wordlessly hands it to Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh. Fuck— okay." She reads it through. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There's no way in <em>hell</em> I'm going to that cunt's funeral." Agatha says flatly, sitting back down beside Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio sighs, tossing the invitation onto the table infront of them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What?" She shrugs. "We're crossing the bridge like we said, Rio, and it's leading to a very big <em>no</em>. I can't."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Look, I know you don't want to, I don't either." Rio says, turning to Agatha and placing a hand on her chin, guiding her to meet her eyes. "It's going to be fucking <em>awful</em>, but we have to, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can't." It's hushed, barely audible.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio cups her cheek, brushing her thumb over the skin. "You can, cariño. I'll be right next to you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And that is exactly how they find themselves entering a church two weeks later.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wears a full black suit and blouse with a dark purple tie, her hair cascading down her shoulders, while Rio wears a long, black v-neck dress with an open back, with her hair down, softly framing her face. If they were going to go to Evanora Harkness' funeral, they were going to look good doing it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes the lead, knowing how utterly uncomfortable this is for Agatha. She holds her hand, takes her into the building and avoids any awkward conversations with other guests. Luckily, they find a seat at the far back corner, keeping them from too many strange looks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Of course Evanora wanted her funeral in a church. It's like she just wanted to spite Agatha in any way possible, even after death.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It starts to feel more real when a coffin is brought through. But also strange— Agatha and Rio turn to eachother, frowning, the same thing on their mind. There were no bodily remains, so it's just for...the aesthetic?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A priest stands at the front of the room, before the coffin, and sprinkles some holy water on it. Agatha fights a scoff, instead reaching for Rio's hand and enclosing her fingers around it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The priest clears his throat, opening up a script. <em>"Revelation 21:4.</em> He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's knee begins to bounce uncontrollably, taking a deep breath. Some of her worst memories are in churches and Rio knows it. She hasn't heard <em>Bible verses</em> in fifteen years.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The priest talks about Evanora's life from beginning to end. Not once is Agatha mentioned. It's as if she never existed at all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Though, Agatha doesn't feel any sort of sadness— it's more anger. But even then, it isn't much. Agatha took her <em>life</em>. That's more or less depleted all the anger she had.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before any eulogies are read, there are two hymns that are sung. Neither Agatha nor Rio join in, instead settling on just holding eachother's hands and keeping their heads down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The first eulogy has Agatha thinking of murder. It's a woman, similar age to Evanora, and she's in fucking pieces. She sobs about how Evanora was <em>such a good lady</em> and how much of a <em>positive asset she was to the church.</em> Evanora Harkness and <em>good lady</em> do not belong in the same sentence.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Speaking of <em>thoughts of murder,</em> this isn't the first that Agatha's had since killing her mother. It started small, just simple thoughts, but it turned into real urges, having to genuinely resist killing people in the street.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had told Rio about it almost immediately. She had brought it up, framing it as a conversation surrounding <em>Rio's</em> urges. "What do the urges feel like?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But of course, Rio had taken the hint, instantly asking, "You're getting urges?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thus, the conversation about Agatha's urges to kill again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had told her that it's okay if she needs to do it, but to be careful. She had said that in her own experience it gets harder the longer it's left, but she can't say the same for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But it did get much worse. Much, <em>much</em> worse, until Agatha had reached some sort of breaking point. She had gone out for a late night walk in the park with the intention to kill someone, to make it quick and clean and hide it somewhere in the forest, just how Rio would.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And she did. She wasn't sure she would, but after noticing that a man, maybe in his thirties, was following her through the park, she knew she couldn't leave without killing him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was messy. She didn't mean for it to be, but she was disgusted that he had been following her. It scared her, yes, like it would scare any woman being followed at night, but she was more angry than anything.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She had gone home, her hands blood-stained, and told Rio all about it. Rio, who told her she was <em>proud</em>, that she <em>did a good job.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The urges had subsided a significant amount following the murder, but they hadn't disappeared fully. Over the days, they would grow, some days more than others, but she hasn't reached that point of <em>need</em> yet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few prayers are spoken, followed by another eulogy, then another hymn. Agatha's been completely lost in the memories of the last time she killed, the way Rio looked at her, the way Rio touched her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before she knows it, the service is over and people have started to get up to leave flowers on the coffin. For appearences, Agatha and Rio also stand, but don't make any effort to move.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the corner of her eye, she catches Rio shiver a little. Agatha fights a smirk, remembering just how she had told her she'd be cold, but slips her blazer off out of instinct and wraps it over Rio's shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns to her, a small smile on her face. She opens her mouth to presumably thank her, but something catches her eye.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She clears her throat, trying and failing to hide the way her face is flushing. "You...you're wearing suspenders."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns, a small laugh escaping her. "Yeah?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my God, I need to fuck you so bad, you look so fucking good." She's looking at Agatha like she'd devour her if they weren't in public.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah?" She responds, biting her lip. "You're cruel, saying things like that in public."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha pauses. She looks around, notices how nobody's looking at them, how they're all distracted with the emtpy coffin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Find us somewhere quiet in here, won't you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes widen, her mouth opening and closing a few times before she says, "In— in the church?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Did I stutter?" Agatha murmurs, raising her eyebrows as a little check-in, making sure Rio's comforfable with it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio is absolutely comfortable. She reaches forwards and grabs Agatha's hand, then leads her to some sort of corridor down the side. They go up a flight of stairs, ending up in a hallway where they can no longer hear the sounds of the service beneath them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once it's clear they're alone, Rio grabs hold of Agatha's suspenders and pulls her body flush against her own, crashing their lips together in a bruising kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the momentum, Rio walks Agatha to the nearest wall and pushes her up against it, causing her lips to part in a gasp. As Rio's tongue enters her mouth, curling against the roof of her mouth, Agatha moans and wraps her arms around Rio's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio wastes very little time, untucking Agatha's shirt from her trousers, and shoving her hand down beneath her underwear. She's met by a clear wetness, one which coats her fingers immediately as she draws tight circles around Agatha's clit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's mouth falls open with a soft moan, her head falling back against the wall. With the new access, Rio dips her head and presses open-mouthed kisses to her neck. She tugs Agatha's shirt down to reach her collarbone, licking a wet line across it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The mixture of sensations bring a series of shakey, breathy moans from Agatha, and it makes Rio just a little bit more aware that they are <em>in a chuch at Evanora's funeral.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The realisation startles her a little, but she doesn't let up. Instead, Rio slides her free hand up to Agatha's face, tracing over her lips before gliding two fingers inside. Agatha's eyes slip shut, sucking Rio's fingers deeper into her mouth almost on instinct. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's it, hermosa, keep quiet for me." Rio murmurs, grinning at the way Agatha's chokes a little around the fingers in her mouth. "Good girl."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's back arches, her eyes squeezing tightly shut with a muffled groan. Rio leans back, studying Agatha's face and every little glint in her eye. She needs <em>more</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Abruptly, Rio pulls her fingers out of Agatha's mouth and gently wraps that hand around her throat, asking permission, all while her fingers rub faster against her clit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whines as her eyebrows knit together in pleasure, placing her hand over Rio's and squeezing until her breath is strained. Her mouth falls open, panting short gasps of air mixed with moans into the space between them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh," Rio reminds her in a whisper, tightening her hand just slightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hand returns above Rio's, squeezing a little tighter and making her own breath hitch.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At the realisation of what Agatha wants, Rio softly chuckles. "How about this, cariño— I'll let you breathe when you come for me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods frantically, her hips rolling into Rio's hand, desperate for release.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Words, baby." Rio loosens her hold and admires how Agatha takes in a deep breath before speaking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes. Please." She begs, her voice already raspy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's right, good girl, Agatha." She tightens her hold around her neck, cutting off Agatha's breathing before she can reply.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's mouth stays open with her eyes slowly shutting, her body instinctively trying to take a breath but falling unable. It just heightens her arousal, her pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And when you come for me," Rio muses, "you can be as <em>loud</em> as you want."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's head drops against the wall again, and Rio loosens her hand just enough for her to take in a little oxygen, then tightens it again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want everyone to know how well your wife is fucking you in this church."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Constantly, Rio's paying attention to the expression on Agatha's face, the way her body feels in her arms. She's always careful, never wants to accidentally push too far.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How does that sound, baby?" Rio coos, leaning forwards and brushing her lips against Agatha's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's nod is faint from the lack of oxygen, but it's clear how much she wants it when her back arches, pressing into Rio again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Rio darts her tongue out and wets her lips. "You want everyone to know you're my good girl?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another faint nod, and Rio can just about feel Agatha's pulse slow beneath her fingertips. She loosens her hold just so, allows her to take in the smallest amount of air, and tightens her hand again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're taking me so well, mi amor." She breathes. "Fuck, you really would let me kill you, wouldn't you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio feels Agatha's body tense— she just needs another little push to fall apart in Rio's arms.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come for me, baby, let me hear you." She husks, seconds before completely releasing Agatha's throat and curling that hand into her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's all Agatha needed— she sucks in a sharp breath, her head dropping into Rio's shoulder as a flood of moans and whimpers escape her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good girl, breathe for me, querida." Rio reminds her, coaxing her through her orgasm and into a second.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"R–Rio—" Agatha's arms wrap tighter around Rio, making an effort to hold herself steady as her knees buckle with the strength of the second orgasm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gently, Rio lowers her to sit on the floor against the wall, kneeling down infront of her as she does so. She holds her as her body relaxes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You did so good, mi vida, such a good girl." She praises, stroking a hand through Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues to breathe deeply, replenishing her body of the lost oxygen, though it's a little more strained than usual. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns. "Are you okay? I didn't hurt you, did I?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wordlessly, Agatha shakes her head against her, still trying to catch her breath. She shuffles a little closer to Rio, who presses a kiss to the top of her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Agatha's breathing slows to a normal pace and evens out a little. She stays slumped against Rio though, not quite wanting their little moment to end. More so, not wanting to go back downstairs and put a flower on her mother's empty coffin— even if it <em>is</em> just for appearance's sake.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Carefully, Rio pulls back and presses a tender kiss to her lips, humming against her contently. She places a hand on Agatha's jaw, angling her head up so that she can look at her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Underneath the light, she can catch a few faint bruises inflicted from her hand, and softly traces them with her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure I didn't hurt you?" She asks, tilting her head to examine her neck a little closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, honey, I liked it. A lot." She chuckles lightly. "You know I'd ask you to stop if I needed you to."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That doesn't answer my question, mi cielito." Rio counters, pulling her head down and looking her in the eye.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I mean, you're restricting my breathing, sugar, it's not going to be painless." Agatha places a hand on Rio's cheek, still trembling slightly from the adrenaline.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans into it, getting lost for a moment in how soft Agatha's skin is against hers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But I <em>liked</em> it," Agatha says, a little louder, "and I trust you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just nods, then pulls her into another kiss. "I liked it, too. And I trust <em>you.</em>"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good." Agatha takes in another deep breath. "Help me stand up?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't hesitate, getting to her feet and pulling Agatha up with her. She places a hand at the small of Agatha's back, guiding her through the hallway then down the stairs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As expected, they're the last to leave, and give the priest the impression that they had gone off to cry privately, or something like that. Either way, he doesn't question them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Outside, though, the majority of the guests have grouped around, making some conversation about Evanora. They hadn't anticipated that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio tries her best to just lead Agatha through the crowd, to get in their car and leave, but a man crosses infront of them, holding his hand out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns for a moment before shaking his hand, discreetly wiping her own against her trousers when she pulls away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you for coming." He says, then asks, "How did you know Evanora? I don't think we've met."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh," Agatha fights a smile. "I'm her daughter."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wait..." He narrows his eyes a little, then laughs, much too loudly for being polite at a funeral. "You're... <em>Agatha</em>, right?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her chest tightens a little. "I am."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, Evanora told me she had a dyke daughter—" He trails off into another laugh. "She said you were dead, though."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, did she?" Agatha's voice is a little squeaky with the effort she's putting in to not start screaming at this guy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, said you got into a car accident. She told me it was the best day of her life."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha can reply, Rio grabs her arm and pulls her away, taking her to an area that's a little more closed off than where they were before.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want to fucking kill him." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's words cause Agatha's breath to catch in the back of her throat. She pauses for a moment, processing what Rio's said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans back against the wall, furrowing her brows as she looks over the expression on Rio's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can't tell if you're being serious." She says, tilting her head to the side slightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a step closer, placing both hands on Agatha's shoulders. "I'm serious. I want him dead."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Feeling her breathing quicken, Agatha stares into Rio's eyes for a moment, examining how little of her iris is visible. "Okay." She says. "Okay, let's— we need to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I have an idea." Rio murmurs, softly cutting in.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow in silent question, wordlessly asking her to elaborate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You go home, I'll meet you there. I'll bring him home."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You— you're gonna <em>flirt</em> with the man that just called me a dyke to my face?" Agatha frowns.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Trust me, cariño." She says, then lowers her voice to a sultry whisper. "I'll let you watch."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha fucking <em>whimpers</em> at Rio's promise. Her eyes flutter shut for a moment before she opens them again, locking on to Rio's lips before her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks back at her with the same hunger, the same <em>thirst</em> churning in her lower stomach, between her legs. Her lips are parted, damp with saliva.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, Ri." Agatha breathes. "Yeah— yes, please. I want to watch."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And you will." Rio takes her wife's hand and presses a light kiss to her knuckles, sealing the promise. "Go home, baby, I'll see you soon."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Approximately twenty minutes later, Agatha finds herself sat on the sofa in their living room, waiting for Rio to return home. Waiting to <em>watch</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hasn't let her watch before. Whenever Agatha would ask to join her when she left to kill, she gently refused. She had told Agatha that it's because she wanted her to be sure she actually <em>wants</em> to watch, and isn't just doing it for Rio's sake.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Time and time again, Agatha had made it clear that she's sure, but Rio had still been on the fence about it. So, Agatha dropped it. She waited until Rio brought it up again, and now that she had, now that she's letting Agatha <em>watch—</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans under her breath. She's had to sit atop her own hands in practically a puddle of her own wetness to stop herself from getting off before Rio comes home.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sure, Rio would always describe her murders to Agatha when she'd come home, she'd gently re-enact them and fuck her until she can't walk, but it wouldn't compare to <em>watching</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Watching Rio take her favourite knife and plunge it into that man's chest, just to take it out and stab him again. Watching her soak herself with the blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Abruptly, Agatha stands, rushing into the kitchen and opening their designated <em>murder knife</em> drawer. She takes the one which she knows is Rio's favourite, the one Rio always takes out with her, and brings it back to the sofa.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She sits back down and holds the knife by the handle with one hand, and lightly pokes the tip of it into the opposite finger. As it draws a drop of blood, she whimpers, pulling her finger away and placing it in her mouth, licking every last drop.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sound of keys in the front door breaks Agatha out of her little bubble. She licks the speck of blood off of the knife, then stands and moves just out of sight.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's voice is the first thing she hears when the door opens, followed by that man. Resisting a scoff, Agatha just tightens her own grip on the knife, trying to steady herself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you mind taking off your shoes?" Rio asks the guy, then clears her throat rather loudly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Now</em>. The little signal they had agreed on. If everything's going to plan, then Rio's just about to—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There's a strong thud against one of the walls, and Agatha steps just into view with the knife. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What the— God, you're so hot." The man stammers out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At this angle, Rio can see her but the man cannot. Agatha catches the way Rio's eyes roll at his statement.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's gaze then falls onto the knife, while Agatha looks at the way Rio's so effortlessly pressing the man up against the wall. Her pupils are blown, but not for the reason he thinks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A sweet smile then plasters itself onto Rio's face. "Agatha, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The mans head whips around, looking at Agatha in pure disgust. "What the fuck?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pass me that, will you?" Rio asks breathily, gesturing to the knife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hands her the knife without a second thought, then backs off to lean against the oppisite wall, watching them from the side on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, and it's my favourite. Such a good girl." She muses, pressing her forearm firmly into the mans neck, keeping him pinned.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just about represses her whimper, roughly biting her lip until she almost tastes blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What the hell is—" He spots the knife. "What the <em>fuck?!"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh." Rio murmurs, positioning the knife at the centre of his torso, before turning to Agatha, who has her arms wrapped around herself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He tries to squirm out of Rio's hold, but falls unsuccessful. "No, no, no, please, wait—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without breaking a beat of eye contact, Rio shoves the knife in his chest to the hilt in one smooth thrust. Agatha's mouth falls open with a quiet, breathy mewl, one that only she can hear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When the knife comes out, it's coated in blood, and said blood is also steadily oozing out of the wound on the man's chest. He's groaning in pain, but both Agatha and Rio have tuned it out, solely focusing on eachother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath continuously hitches as she looks between Rio and the wound and the knife and Rio— Rio has a few spots of blood on her face, and Agatha just wants to go over there and lick it all off and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio plunges the knife into his torso again, this time a little higher, still not ripping her eyes from Agatha's. She shakily exhales with her need, allowing the man to weakly drop to his knees on the floor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a step back. "Get on your knees and hold his head back for me, cariño."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha's never wanted anything more. She kneels down just behind the man, grabbing the back of his shirt collar with one hand for leverage, while the other roughly sinks into his hair and tugs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She watches as Rio crouches down infront of him, grabbing his tie and pulling him a little closer. His pleas for his life are ignored, tuned out, as Rio lifts the knife up and presses it against his throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And she slices it across in one clean sweep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha fucking <em>moans</em> when the blood splatters onto Rio's face, and she doesn't miss the way Rio's eyes darken with the sound.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>, is <em>this</em> how Rio felt watching Agatha kill her mother?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Holy shit, Rio." Agatha's voice is trembling a little. She drops the body, letting it thump into the floor, and shuffles closer to Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you—" Rio starts, but it's cut off with Agatha's lips against her own, Agatha's hands on her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly stands, bringing Agatha to her feet, too, not once breaking the kiss. Agatha tugs at Rio's hair, pulling away for a moment. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can I please fuck you?" She whines.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The blunt question brings more heat between Rio's legs, tightening her hold on the flesh at Agatha's waist. In her other hand, she still has a strong hold on the bloodied knife. She nods with her lips parted.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, you look so pretty like this." She murmurs, smearing the blood over Rio's face with a small whimper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just for you, querida." Rio whispers breathily into the space between them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha then grabs her hand and pulls her upstairs, and Rio isn't sure she's ever seen Agatha so desperate to fuck her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once they enter the bedroom, Agatha turns Rio around and pushes her up against the wall. She steps closer so that her front is flush with Rio's back, and reaches her hand up to tug the zip of her dress down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hyperfocused on the sound and depth of Rio's breathing as she pulls the dress down her shoulders, dropping it to pool at her feet. She then slides her knee up between Rio's legs, pressing right against her core, and Agatha can feel just how wet she is through her trousers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, you're so wet." Agatha breathes out, barely aware of her own voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I have been since I fucked you in the church." Rio husks, her palms pressed flat against the wall.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, prying the knife from Rio's hand and briefly tucking it into her own pocket. She then reaches around her own neck and removes her tie, throwing it down onto the floor and getting a head start at undressing herself by undoing her shirt buttons.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You remember your safeword, don't you, my love?" She leans forwards until her breath is fanning against her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, leaning back a little until she feels the lace of Agatha's bra on her back. "Yes."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Remind me?" Agatha doesn't <em>need</em> reminding, she'd never forget her wife's safeword, but Rio's comfort is much more important than her own pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Lavender."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good girl." Agatha praises, stroking a hand down her spine. "Wait right here for me. Don't move."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio breathes out a small <em>okay</em> as Agatha steps away. Her head is resting against the wall, her chest pressing up against it. She tries to focus on the noises from behind her, the sound of rustling fabric and a drawer opening and closing. It gives her a relatively good idea of what Agatha's planning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few moments pass, and Rio feels a firm hand on her shoulder, turning her around. She meets Agatha's eye, but Rio's breath stutters as she feels the tip of their strap brush along her inner thigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's completely bare infront of her, but all Rio can look at is the blue of her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds up her other hand, which is gripping the bloody knife so tightly that her knuckles have gone white. She holds it up in the space between them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Clean up your mess for me, pretty girl." She murmurs, soft but firm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Watching intently, Agatha whimpers as Rio's tongue drags over the flat sides of the blade, the blood staining her tongue and lips. As she turns the knife around so that Rio can clean the other side, her other hand hooks at one of Rio's knees, pulling her leg up to her waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Keep this here." Agatha taps her thigh to make her point, then looks back at Rio to catch when she presses a kiss to the blade, signalling that she's done.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha then shifts the position of the knife, gently pressing it to Rio's throat. She smirks at the hitch in her breath, then reaches between them to grab the strap in her other hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Put your arms around my shoulders, honey." And the moment that Rio does it, she slides the strap a few inches into her, drawing out a high pitched mewl.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha drives the strap a couple inches deeper, curling her hand around the muscle of Rio's thigh by her waist, keeping her legs spread wide enough to take all of her. As she does, Rio's body tenses a little, and Agatha pauses for a moment, pulling the knife from her throat a fraction.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Does that feel okay?" She asks quickly, furrowing her brows as she looks over Rio's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods. "Uh-huh. Yes, please keep going," She then clasps a hand around Agatha's— the one holding the knife— and pushes it back up against her throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, you're so—" Agatha slips her eyes shut with a shakey breath, "so <em>mine."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hips jerk out at Agatha's words, taking the strap deeper— to the hilt in the process. She chokes out a moan, arching her back into Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Say it, Ri," Agatha pushes somehow deeper, "sweetheart, tell me—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yours," Rio breathes, "I'm yours."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's a good girl." She coos, inching her face closer until she lands a slow, deep kiss to her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hands curl tightly in her hair, rolling her hips as Agatha starts to thrust the toy into her. It's slow but precise, each movement of Agatha's hips aiming to give the most pleasure to her wife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"All mine," Agatha murmurs, her nose nudging against Rio's with each thrust.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Prove it." She challenges, a playful glint in her eye.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow, tilting her head to the side a little. She then slows her hips just a little, so that she's essentially just rolling her hips. With each of their ragged breaths filling the small space between them, Agatha brings the knife down a fraction, the tip of it poking into the skin at the centre of her sternum. Rio gives her a small nod, encouraging her to do whatever she wants to do. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With an agonising slowness, Agatha slices a shallow diagonal cut, glancing up at Rio's face every few seconds to search for any signs of discomfort. When none are found, she draws a second line with the knife in the opposite direction, connecting them at the top like some kind of unfinished triangle.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha presses her forehead against Rio's when she forms the final line, creating a perfect <em>A</em> in her flesh. Her hips have kept their painstakingly slow pace, steadily coaxing Rio towards her orgasm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"All mine,"</em> Agatha repeats, the words whispered so quietly that Rio can barely hear it over the sounds of her wetness with each thrust.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After taking a glance down to her own chest, seeing the cuts with her own eyes, Rio lazily pushes forwards and closes the distance betweem them. They meet in a collision of tongue and teeth, moaning and whimpering into the kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ag— Agatha," Rio husks between kisses. "Agatha,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls away enough to see Rio's face, expecting to see an expression of discomfort, but is instead met with her wife looking more aroused than she has before.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, baby?" Agatha asks, taking a glimpse at the carving in Rio's chest and putting just a little more force behind her thrusts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers, her head thudding back against the wall. "Go deeper," She pleads, but quickly clarifies by clasping one of her hands over Agatha's— the one holding the knife, and angles it back towards the carving. "Make sure— make sure it'll scar. <em>Claim me."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip, then lets go of Rio's leg with her other hand, which hooks further around her waist to keep her legs spread. With her now free hand, Agatha cups her face and brushes some of her hair back from it. She reaffirms her grip on the knife, then takes one last look at Rio, silently asking <em>are you sure?</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods again, her pupils so dilated that there's hardly any brown visible. So, Agatha presses the knife back into the wound, deepening the cut and dragging it back over the lines.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A half-pained, half-pleasured whimper falls from Rio's lips, her knee buckling a little as more fresh streaks of blood fall over her breasts, onto her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hold on to me, honey, that's it." Agatha breathes, moving her arm to wrap around Rio's waist in an attempt to keep her steady.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>, Agatha," Her eyes have started to gloss over with tears from the desperation combined with the pain. But she hasn't safeworded, hasn't told her to stop.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha checks in just to make sure. "Are you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, <em>yes, please</em> don't stop, mi amor." She rambles, her eyes falling shut and dropping a tear in the process.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Look at me, sweetheart," Agatha says, and continues when Rio's eyes flutter open, "tell me you're okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's said as a question, not a command, and Rio realises she never actually <em>said</em> that, only begged Agatha not to stop.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods. "I'm— I'm okay, I promise, <em>please</em> keep—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's cut off with her own groan as Agatha deepens another line, holding on to her a little tighter than before.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Breath, baby, there you go," Agatha praises softly, "you're doing so well for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio breathes out a high pitched mewl, unable to focus on anything other than Agatha's words and the way the blood is trailing down her entire body. As Agatha deepens the final line, Rio involuntarily chokes out a pained sound— she can <em>feel</em> the cut deepening under the knife, and it turns her on to no fucking end.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh, I know," Agatha murmurs, "it's alright, I've got you. Almost done."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shudders a breath, her eyes squeezing shut with the last stroke of the knife over the cuts. Well, what she <em>thought</em> was the last stroke. Agatha inhales sharply and does one final stroke across the whole carving, opening the wound a little more and causing more blood to trail down Rio's torso.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"All done, pretty girl." Agatha tilts Rio's head up, angling it so that their eyes meet. "How do you feel?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yours." Rio's words are a little slurred, the blood loss starting to get to her. Then, more whiny, "Need you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me more." Agatha says quietly, moving her face a little closer to Rio's but not close enough to kiss her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Need you to— to fuck me, I—" She stops abruptly, almost starts fucking <em>drooling</em> when Agatha lifts the knife up and takes it in her own mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives one side of it a good lick, then raises a brow, "Don't stop on my account. Keep talking, pretty girl."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a shakey breath, Rio does as she says. "Need you to make me come. Please. Need your cock."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>That</em> makes Agatha pause. She takes the knife out from her mouth and holds it out to the side, making a show of dropping it with a clatter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please," Rio whispers, her brows knitting together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come on, darling, you can do better than <em>that,"</em> Agatha tuts, then wipes her middle and ring finger through the blood still trailing down Rio's torso, collecting a fair bit on them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Take me." Rio begs. "Claim me— <em>please</em>, Aga—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Those two fingers are roughly pushed into Rio's mouth, who closes her eyes with a groan. She sucks her fingers deeper, and the sounds are fucking <em>obscene</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A little bit of blood leaks out from Rio's mouth, trickling from her chin to her neck. Agatha's quick to catch it— she dips her head down, licking it up from the base of Rio's throat to the underside of her jaw, and it just tastes so <em>Rio</em> that her hips roll out of their own accord.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio moans around her fingers, giving Agatha her best pleading eyes. But Agatha just pushes her fingers a little deeper, until Rio chokes on them a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You want me to take you? To claim you?" Agatha coos, huffing a laugh when Rio nods with a muffled <em>mhm</em>. "Oh, sweetheart. I've <em>already</em> claimed you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She reaches her free hand down, lightly tracing over the cuts on her chest with her middle finger. It stings, but it sends a rush of heat through Rio's body, arching her back so that Agatha puts a little more pressure behind her finger.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes her own bloody finger up to her mouth, licking the blood away before hooking her hand back round Rio's thigh for leverage.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Staring directly into the golden brown of her wife's eyes, Agatha starts to move her hips again, wet sounds starting to fill the room along with Rio's moans— still muffled around her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes Agatha all of eight seconds to come.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's fingers fall from Rio's mouth and her arm wraps around her shoulders. And when she groans, burying her face against Rio's shoulder as she takes a moment to recover, her wife chuckles lightly, still in the daze of arousal.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What <em>was</em> that? Eight seconds?" Rio threads a hand into her hair, tugging her back to look at her and earning herself a whimper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shut up." Agatha commands, but it comes out breathy. "Do you want me to fuck you or not?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods enthusiastically with a comically large grin, and Agatha has to fight back a laugh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," She lightly thrusts into her, instantly breaking Rio back into the perfectly submissive state she had fallen into. "I asked if you want me to fuck you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my God, <em>please—"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And of course, just to be a little shit, Agatha cuts her off with a series of hard thrusts, hitting Rio in the perfect spots.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Each pump of her hips gradually builds Agatha's second orgasm, all while coaxing Rio into hers. Agatha's gripping her thigh so tightly she thinks it'll bruise the flesh, but the idea of it just has her hips faltering.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's climax rushes through her in steady waves just seconds before Agatha reaches her own. As she does, Rio pulls her wife into a quick, messy kiss, before nipping at her bottom lip and tugging at her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Another," Rio whimpers, "<em>please</em>, cariño, one more, please,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles at Rio's desperation, before reconnecting their lips and moving her hips again at a maddening pace. They're both moaning into eachother's mouths, and Rio's legs start to shake as she comes up to the peak of her second climax.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite being so overstimulated that it almost <em>hurts</em>, Agatha fucks her into it, the whole way though it, and bites at her lip so hard that she draws blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stops the moment Rio relaxes against her, taking in deep, shakey breaths as she rests her forehead against Rio's. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you alright?" Rio asks, stroking through Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"More than." And each of them whine as Agatha pulls out, but they meet in a messy kiss. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans again upon tasting the blood on her lips, and presses her body flush against Rio's, feeling the blood smear over them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a while, they just stand there, kissing and touching and <em>feeling</em>. Neither of them want to think about the inevitable. The fact that they'll have to clean up, probably have to <em>talk about it.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Their kisses naturally slow to a stop, and Agatha unbuckles the harness from her hips and lets it drop, kicks it away and then wraps her arms back around Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Guiding her wife's head into her shoulder, Rio threads her fingers through her hair, holding her close. Agatha just nuzzles her head into Rio's neck, sighing contently.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We should probably go clean up downstairs, right?" Rio asks quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Five more minutes."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And they spend a whole twelve minutes standing there together against the wall. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had noticed— noticed exactly how long they were stood there. She didn't say anything, though, not until it hit the fifteen minute mark. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But before even <em>thinking about</em> dealing with the mess downstairs, Agatha insists that she takes care of the carving on Rio's chest. She cleans the wound, wipes the dried blood away, takes her time to tape gauze over it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>An hour later, they clean up downstairs like it's a regular evening. It doesn't take too long, seeing as most of the blood is fresh, but they cremate the body, put the ashes in a ziplock bag and tuck it under the floorboards with the others.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, they make dinner as if <em>nothing happened</em>. As if they hadn't had a dead body in their house twenty minutes prior. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's a little strange, but they both appreciate it. Appreciate the unconditional love from the other, and appreciate the fact that they aren't judging eachother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And in all honesty, Agatha's grateful that Rio had her own experience with killing. Otherwise, the morning she murdered her mother would have gone very differently. Agatha finds herself thinking about that a lot.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Later that evening, they lay beside eachother in bed, their lips locked and their legs intertwined. It isn't sexual, it isn't an attempt at initiating anything— they just want to kiss eachother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, their kisses come to a natural stop, and they each pull back a little to look at eachother properly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you feeling okay?" Rio asks, then elaborates at the confused look on Agatha's face. "About the clean up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha chuckles softly, "you're forgetting I killed a man two weeks ago."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Right." Rio sighs with a light smile. "I wish I had come with you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You should've."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can I ask you something?" Rio suddenly asks, putting a hand on Agatha's chin and tilting her head up. When Agatha nods, she continues, "Why do you like to watch?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to respond, but Rio beats her back to it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know how <em>I</em> feel when I watch <em>you</em>, I'm just curious if it's the same."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Rio Vidal</em>, are you trying to seduce me at this hour?" She teases with a smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio plays along with an overdramatic gasp. "I would <em>never</em>, mi vida," Then, a little softer, "curious, is all."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The look on your face." Agatha says, brushing her thumb over Rio's cheekbone. "The blood. You look so pretty when you're covered in blood for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath hitches, but she doesn't say anything, encouraging Agatha to continue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The fact that I know you'd never really hurt <em>me</em>." She says, a little queiter. "It reminds me how much I trust you, and how much you trust me by letting me watch." Then, she brushes a hand through Rio's hair. "What about you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You pretty much summed it up." She laughs lightly. "I had imagined you killing someone so often, but actually <em>seeing</em> it? Fuck, you just looked so... yourself."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Myself?" Agatha frowns. "What do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And for a moment, Rio thinks she's said the wrong thing, but she's quickly proved wrong when Agatha brushes over her cheeks again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Like... it's like your face was <em>made</em> to be covered in blood."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A small sound falls from Agatha's lips, and she suddenly blurts out, "I want you to cut me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens her mouth to speak, shocked but not opposed to Agatha's request. "Cut you? Right now?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. Like I did with you." She gently places her palm flat on Rio's sternum, over the top of her vest. Over the gauze covering the carving of Agatha's initial.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just about manages to hold in her whimper by biting her lip. <em>"Fuck</em>, are you sure?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please, Ri." She whispers, her eyebrows twitching as she does so.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay— okay, lay on your back, I'll go get the knife." She rushes to get out of bed and grabs the knife, still on the floor in the bedroom from where they had fucked earlier.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio picks it up, she switches a lamp on so she has more light, glancing over at Agatha's face caught in the golden hues. She then goes into the bathroom and grabs a towel to lay underneath Agatha, ultimately preventing the blood from staining the bed any more than it already has.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio goes back over to her impatiently, pulling the duvet off of Agatha and straddling her hips. She guides her to sit up for a moment and places the towel flat beneath her, then lays her back down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure?" Rio asks, reaching for the buttons of the already blood-stained flannel Agatha's wearing— the one she wore when disposing of her mother's body.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." Agatha nods, lifting her hands over her head and grabbing the pillow to ground herself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just reaches forwards and grabs Agatha's hands, placing them on her hips, which her wife absolutely does not complain about.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Rio undoes the top few buttons of the flannel, moving the fabric out of the way to look at the portion of Agatha's skin that will soon become her canvas.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me if you need a break." She says, then positions the knife correctly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She waits for Agatha to nod before carving the first line. Agatha's hands instinctively squeeze Rio's hips to an almost painful level, but all Rio can focus on are the sounds Agatha's making and the way the blood pools on her chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the angle, it can barely drip, so Rio grabs a few tissues from their bedside table and dabs some of the blood away to see what she's doing. She lines up the knife again, to draw the curve of the <em>R</em>, but then she feels it. Agatha's trembling beneath her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you okay?" Rio asks, furrowing her brows. "Was that too deep?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head with tears growing in her eyes. "No, no, no— not at all, I <em>want</em> it to— to stay— keep going."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio easily complies after hearing Agatha's reassurance, lining the knife up again and pressing it into Agatha's skin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's alright," Rio says quietly, "you're doing really well."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's done surprisingly smoothly, and Rio places a hand on Agatha's cheek as she starts the third and final cut. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There you go, mi amor, all finished," She praises, then adds, "all mine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhales shakily, then repeats, "All yours."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She dabs at the wound with tissues until the bleeding has slowed, able to make out the lines of the cut. "How does it feel?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Stings." Agatha pulls her brows together. "But it's a good sting. Means I'm yours."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans down and presses a kiss to her lips, then her forehead, her cheeks, her nose, her lips again. "You feel a bit lightheaded?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A little. I'm okay." She breathes with a smile. "Clean me up?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, mi amor." She murmurs, grabbing some antiseptic wipes and gauze from the bedside table drawer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio carefully and thoroughly cleans the skin around the wound, then places the gauze over the top and tapes it in place, just as Agatha had done to her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha reaches a hand up to Rio's chest, tracing over the bandage, murmuring, "Mine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yours." She responds, then stands up, brushing a hand over her cheek. "Gonna get you some water."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whines in protest of Rio leaving, but eventually lets her. She lays down, one of her fingers absentmindedly tracing over the cuts on her chest, biting her lip at the thought of it scarring, being permanent.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The other cuts Rio has given her have lightly scarred, fading over time, but this one's different. Deeper, has more meaning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And when Rio returns, she convinces her wife to have a few sips of water before she grabs Rio's wrist and drags her into bed. Switching off the lamp, allowing the light to bleed into darkness, Agatha curls into Rio and rests her head over her heart, listening to it beat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha then takes hold of Rio's hand and laces their fingers together. They lay in silence for a few minutes, looking up at the ceiling but stealing glimpses of eachother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love that you love all of this." Rio suddenly mumbles, her voice wavering a little with emotion.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilts her head up to look at her. "Love what, sweetheart?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This." And she places her palm over the gauze on Agatha's sternum. Then, she whispers, "Me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You?" Agatha echoes. "You love that I love you?" She tries to hide her joy but the corners of her mouth curl up a little. She's always loved how sappy Rio can get in the evenings.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." Rio hums, twirling some of Agatha's hair around her fingers. "Love that you stayed. That you're not scared."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't think I could ever be scared of you, my love. Everything makes sense as long as you're here." Agatha says, caressing Rio's knuckles with her thumb. "Get some sleep, sugar. I love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you, too, mi cielito."</p>

<p>Two months following her mother's funeral, Agatha wakes up to her phone buzzing against the wood of the bedside table. She groans, then presses a kiss to Rio's forehead before pulling out of her hold to grab it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>From:</strong> <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b8cbcccbcccad9d6dfddf8c8cad1d6dbddccd7d696dddccd" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p><p><strong>To:</strong> <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="caa2abb8a1e4abadabbea2ab8aa2aba6beaee4a5b8ad" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Talk and Q&amp;A Inquiry</p><p> </p><p>Good Morning Ms Harkness,</p><p> </p><p>My name is Stephen Strange, I teach an advanced creative writing course at Princeton University. </p><p> </p><p>I have so many students aspiring to pursue poetry, and more often than not they bring up you and your work as an inspiration. </p><p> </p><p>My students and I would greatly appreciate if you could take the time to come by and give a talk, answer some questions?</p><p> </p><p>Thank you, Ms Harkness, and I hope you do take me up on my offer.</p><p> </p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Professor Strange</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reads through it twice before blindly reaching a hand out and tapping Rio on her shoulder, waking her up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What time is it?" She mumbles against the pillow.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Doesn't matter, Princeton want me to do a talk." Agatha rushes her words out, looking over at Rio who's now sat up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, <em>Princeton</em> Princeton?" She repeats.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes. Some professor wants me to talk to his students, answer questions." She grins widely.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my God, that's amazing. Are you gonna—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course I'm doing it, Ri, don't be ridiculous." She laughs lightly, placing her phone down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This is so— I'm coming with you, by the way, you know I love to watch you command a room."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I was hoping you would."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, a week later, Agatha finds herself stood at the door to a lecture hall, waiting for Strange to call her up to the front of the room. Rio's sat right in the back row, and just her presence eases Agatha's nerves.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Strange's voice sounds from the front of the room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good afternoon, everyone. Now, we're going to be doing something a little different today, so you can all put your things away unless you'd like to make any notes."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches from the back of the room as the majority of students keep their things out, catching a few murmurs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Today, we have a guest speaker, and she's going to give you guys a talk, and then you're free to ask any questions you may have." Then, he gestures to Agatha. "Class, please give a warm welcome to Agatha Harkness."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few surprised claps ring out, paired with some gasps, as Agatha walks up to the front of the room. She looks over the audience, her gaze lingering on Rio and giving her a soft, private smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Professor." Agatha says, then faces the students again. "So, I've heard a good portion of you want to pursue poetry?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few nods fall over the audience, a few awkward mumbles of agreement. Of course Agatha, who typically likes to interact with an audience, is stuck in a room full of introverts. Whatever.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well, let me just say that it is <em>not</em> easy." This earns her a couple quiet chuckles, and she mentally praises herself for it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She hadn't made any sort of plan, nothing specific to talk about. Instead, she had chosen to simply wing it, and help to give these students the motivation and confidence that they clearly need.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course for some people it <em>will</em> be easy— they'll make the right connections, find the right publishers, and success will get handed to them on a silver platter."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hides a smug smile behind her hand. <em>That's her wife</em>. She runs a hand through her hair, catching Agatha's eye as she talks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But for some people they'll spend their life doing what they love, earn their success through making countless mistakes. And, at the ripe age of thirty-two, they'll still have to argue with their mother who tells them for the fiftieth time that they don't have a real job."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A laugh almost falls from Rio's lips when she realises how hard Agatha's trying not to brag about the fact that Evanora's dead— the fact she killed her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha puts her hands in the pockets of her blazer. "When I was sixteen, I thought I wanted to be a therapist. I was wrong." She says. "I thought I wanted to help other people, but what I really wanted was to help myself. I wanted to figure out what <em>exactly</em> made my mother hate me so much, and destroy it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The students just watch her in admiration, watch her as she lays out her life with no walls— nothing. And Agatha isn't exactly sure why she's doing it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I didn't need to become a <em>therapist</em> to figure out that my mother was a raging bigot— may she rest in peace."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha's saying all of this because this is what <em>she</em> needed when starting <em>her</em> career. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The night after my mother threatened to kick me out, I grabbed a pen, grabbed a notebook, and the words just fell onto the page. They flowed. And then I realised— words are powerful."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gestures with her words, fighting smiles whenever she takes a glimpse at her wife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And being sixteen in an unstable household, all I wanted was power. So I wrote, and kept writing, and all of my feelings poured into the page— into the words that I wrote. All I wanted was to feel powerful, to take back all of the control I had lost when I was young."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Someone's hand shoots up in the audience.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes?" Agatha prompts him with a soft smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>His voice is timid when he asks, "When did that stop?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's smile grows a touch, taking a glance at Rio. "When I met my wife. She made everything easy. She was what I needed." She absentmindedly traces the raised <em>R</em> scar on her chest. "I didn't want power when I was with her, I just wanted to be happy. To be loved the way I deserved, the way I should have been loved my whole life."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taking another long look at Rio, she finds a little comfort it in and continues. "So, when we moved in together, ten years ago, I quit my awful nine to five job and started writing full time. Unlike my mother, Rio encouraged it. She wanted— <em>wants</em> me to be happy."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio blows her a subtle kiss across the room, making a heart shape with her hands. It earns her a small chuckle before Agatha starts talking again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"When I first told her I loved her, I didn't just <em>say it</em>. I got together all of the poems I had written about her since we met, and read each one of them to her. And that was always going to mean more to her than just telling her I love her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels as if she's moments from just spending the rest of her time rambling about how amazing her wife is, so she makes an effort to change the topic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A few weeks later, I showed her all the poems I'd written about my mother, and she encouraged me to get in touch with a publishing company. Two months later, I had two collections out for the world to see. One about my mother, one about Rio. One about the person who broke me and one about the person who helped me put myself back together."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha realises she's said about all of what she had wanted to, and giving herself a powerful closing line in the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, she gives another general smile and says. "I'm more than happy to answer any questions you might—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Six hands raise, and Agatha pauses with a light laugh, glancing at Rio before gesturing to a girl in the front.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hi, I— I love your work," The girl stammers a little, smiling, then says, "I've always wanted to ask— how do you tackle writer's block?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, well," Agatha nods slowly, "for <em>me</em>, I try to listen to what I need. If I <em>can't</em> write, if the words just won't come, then I simply won't write. I'll take breaks when I need to, for as long as I need—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A very targetted cough and a pointed stare from Rio makes her pause. She looks up at her with a small smirk, and a couple of students follow her gaze, seeming to connect the dots.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My wife helps with that." Agatha adds, not taking her eyes off of Rio as she says it. "She'll encourage me to take a break if I've been writing for too long." Then, she turns back to face the girl in the front row. "But I would just say to listen to your body. Don't force yourself to write something because it will <em>not</em> be as good as what you're capable of."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha then asks if there are more questions, then picks a boy near the centre. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hi." He says. "I have a question about your recent collection— I'm curious about the meaning of <em>Love Me?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhales sharply, some of the lines flashing in her mind. <em>Take me for your own and I'll see your pupils blown. Fuck me like you hate me just to see me bleed. </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, her mind drifts to exactly how Rio had fucked her afterwards. She can't bluntly tell this boy it's about sex with her wife— let alone all of the murderous undertones.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well," Agatha forces herself to speak, then clears her throat and chances a look at Rio, who looks like she had been thinking about the exact same thing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's about my wife— Rio." She says after what felt like much too long.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's me!" Rio whisper-shouts from the audience, pointing at herself and basking in the chuckles from the students it earns her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, my love." Agatha sighs with a smile. "It is you." Then, she looks back at the boy. "But the poem's about her...the trust I hold for her. If you've read the collections based around my mother, you'd know that trust is difficult for me. But with my wife, it comes naturally."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's beautiful." The boy murmurs, shaking his head a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles her thanks, then settles for one more question. This time, it's a young girl asking about her next collection, if she can tell them anything about it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What I will say is that it's also about Rio." She says as her lips curl into a smile, glancing up at her wife. "But more specifically, flowers. She's a florist, so flowers mean a lot to her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>God, Rio will never get sick of hearing Agatha talk about her like this.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"When we started calling eachother girlfriends," She says slowly, keeping the exact nature of the first few months of their relationship vague, "she would get me flowers almost every week, each with a special meaning. I'm writing one poem for each type of flower she gave me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As the talk comes to an end, Agatha stays behind for a few minutes to thank Strange for reaching out. Rio stays sat at the back, simply watching her, looking at her in a way that just screams pride.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Agatha hears a boy's voice, and her first thought is that he sounds at least a little gay. She turns around— <em>definitely</em> gay.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ms Harkness, I was wondering if you could sign this?" He gestures to the book in his hands, and it happens to be Agatha's most recent collection.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, of course. What's your name?" She asks, taking a pen and the book from him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Billy. The talk was amazing, by the way." He says. "You're, like, a massive inspiration."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Billy, that's very sweet." She smiles and is about to hand the book back to him, but she pauses with his next words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's so...incredible that with everything you've been through, you've come out so successful."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's smile grows a little despite herself. She hadn't expected anyone to stay behind, let alone a young man talking to her like she's the most amazing person in the world.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because," He continues, "like you, I've— my sexuality's been a big part of my life— my childhood." And Agatha understands exactly what he's saying. "But it's good to know that people like us can still make it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We can do anything we put our minds to, Billy. We don't need anyone's approval, including our parents. All we need is our own." Jesus, what's gotten into her? The only person she really talks to like this is <em>Rio</em>, so why—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Ms Harkness. That means a lot."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course." She opens up the book again and scribbles something new on the page. "Listen, if you'd ever want any help or advice, feel free to drop me an email. I'd be very happy to discuss some of your own work and help you get into the career?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Billy's eyes grow comically wide, and in the meantime, Rio's come downstairs. She moves up beside her wife, putting an arm around her waist and greets the boy with a smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." He says to Agatha, then turns to Rio. "You're Rio, right? God, you must feel so lucky. The poems make it so clear how much she loves you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio share a soft glance, then look back to the boy and exchange pleasantries, making their way to leave.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That evening, they find themselves in a bar downtown, with the intention to celebrate the talk at the university. It wasn't how they had planned to spend the night, but after Rio had insisted to take Agatha out for dinner— how she was so clearly desperate to get Agatha alone the entire time, Agatha figured it would be fun to make her wait a few more hours.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, they go out to a bar. Usually, they'd go to a lesbian bar for the extra comfort, the safeness it provided, but there wasn't one near enough, so they settle for a regular one.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They sit up by the bar, convenient for drinks, but after just one, Agatha finds herself getting <em>extremely</em> carried away with teasing the shit out of Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And this time, she goes for a different approach to drive her crazy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, deliberately, she leans forwards until her breath is brushing Rio's ear. Then, in a smooth, velvety tone, she says, "I want to do it again."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio instantly understands what she's talking about. Agatha hasn't killed anyone since the man following her in the park— her urges must be through the fucking roof.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Placing a hand on Agatha's thigh, Rio replies with a simple, "Yeah?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm. Felt good." She nods slowly, enclosing a hand around her wife's wrist, just to feel her racing pulse under the pads of her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Clearly, Agatha's plan is seeming to work extremely well, seeing as Rio just stares back at her, her lips parted with her tongue darting out to wet them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want you to watch." Agatha murmurs, her words for Rio and Rio only. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, you—" She clears her throat. "You're—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I'm serious." She whispers. "I need to do it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens her mouth and closes it a few times before landing on the right words. "Right— right now?" She stammers. "You need to...kill someone <em>right now?</em>"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." Agatha hums slowly, letting it settle between them before she continues. "Yes, baby. And I want you to watch me do it. I want you to hold me while I do it— I want you to lick the blood off my skin, and I want you to reward me after."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stares at her for a moment, her gaze flickering between Agatha's piercing blue eyes and her lips, which curve into a soft smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want that, my love?" She asks lowly, breathily. "Do you want to watch me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, her hand tightening slightly on Agatha's thigh. "Yes." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good girl." She stands up, patting Rio on the shoulder and saying, "Stay here, I'll be back in a minute."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All Rio can reply with is a quiet, mumbled <em>okay</em>, watching as Agatha wanders through the bar towards the toilets. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had half the mind to have Rio follow her and take her right there in the toilets, but making her wait is just that little bit more fun. So, instead, she stands infront of the mirror and brushes her hands through her hair. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She tucks a few strands behind one of her ears, then unbuttons her blazer and tucks her hands into her trouser pockets. <em>Then</em>, she undoes the top three buttons of her shirt, so that if someone looks close enough, they'll see the top of the <em>R</em> scar on her chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, she's going to absolutely drive Rio<em> mad</em> when she goes back out there.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, that's exactly what she does. With a subtle but deliberate sway to her hips, Agatha makes her way back to where she had left Rio all flustered and needy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, contrary to her expectations, she sees someone talking to her wife. A man, maybe in his fifties, an definitely much too close to Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stays a few steps away, trying to listen in over the blaring music from the bar coupled with chatting people around her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She takes a few moments to study Rio's face, the obviously uncomfortable expression she wears. Occasionally, Rio will smile, but it's paired with a twitch and furrow of her eyebrows, a nervous glance to the side, clearly looking for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A part of her wants to step in, to claim what's hers, but the other part— the part which is in control, wants to know <em>exactly</em> what this man is saying to her wife. And in the midst of all the sound, she manages to catch Rio's voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I'm not looking for anything. I'm married." Rio dismisses whatever he's said. "And even if I wasn't, I'm a lesbian, so."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can just about make out the way the man chuckles, before saying with a slurred voice, "Huh, I bet I could change that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Rio laughs. Not because she's amused at all, but because this man is <em>so fucking unbelievable</em> that she has no other response. He doesn't leave it alone, though, so Rio awkwardly replies, "No, thank you. You definitely couldn't. I've been married to my wife for almost nine years."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns as her gaze shifts to the guy, who has the sort of look on his face that means he's about to do something <em>very</em> stupid.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah?" He takes a step forwards and reaches a hand out, grazing Rio's waist with his fingers, and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What the fuck do you think you're doing?" Agatha steps in, standing right beside Rio and placing a possessive hand on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The guy laughs for a second, then says, "Obviously trying to get laid, what the fuck? Bitch."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's mouth falls open, and she watches as he turns back to Rio, who's now conflicted on whether to feel uncomfortable or safe, now that Agatha's here.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come on, sweetheart." The man says, hardly speaking in full sentences. "Let's go and leave this psycho here."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This <em>psycho,"</em> Agatha scoffs, "is her wife, and she is <em>clearly</em> uncomfortable, what the hell is wrong with you?" Agatha's fully aware that she's rambling, but she can't fucking help it when that man was trying to fuck <em>her</em> wife. "And don't you <em>dare</em> call her sweetheart. She's <em>mine</em>. Got it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The guy chuckles— no, he full on fucking <em>laughs</em> as if this is the most entertaining thing he's seen in his life.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's focus returns to the fact that his hands are <em>still on her wife,</em> so she wraps her arm around Rio's shoulders properly, simultaneous to batting his hand away. "And keep your fucking <em>disgusting</em> hands off of <em>my wife."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That's what startles him a little— the direct contact. He takes a step back with another laugh, muttering, "Fucking crazy bitch." As he walks away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once he's out of sight, Agatha turns around to Rio, her eyes immediately softening at the sight of her. "Are you okay, my love? Did he hurt you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm okay." Rio shakes her head. "It's fine— he just said some shitty things."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs and nervously chews at her lip, turning back around and catching the man's eye. She isn't sure if she's imagining it, but his gaze screams fucking <em>mischief</em>, and her words slip out before she can even catch them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Gonna fucking kill him." She practically growls it and, <em>fuck</em>, Rio's never been this horny in her life— though, maybe except for the first time she saw blood splattered all over Agatha's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio reaches out and places both of her hands on Agatha's cheeks before she can walk away, murmuring, "Not <em>here."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her and waits for her to continue. For a moment, they're just stare at eachother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You said you needed to do it, didn't you?" Rio raises an eyebrow as one of her hands reach around to curl and stroke through Agatha's hair. "Keep an eye on him, we'll follow him out when he leaves. I think we've found tonight's target."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After deciding on no more drinks for the rest of the night, they end up sitting in a booth near the entrance, where they can see almost every angle of the bar. Rio's sat directly beside Agatha, touching her at almost every opportunity— their legs, feet, arms, hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For the most part, they sit in silence. Agatha, true to her word, keeps a scarily close eye on the man, watching his every move and even tilting her head and shuffling around a little so that she doesn't lose him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mi amor, trying to kill him with your eyes won't mean he leaves any quicker." Rio says just loud enough for Agatha to hear, in a teasing tone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thinking." Is all Agatha says, then furrows her brows and nibbles a little at her lower lip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"About?" Rio prompts. She interlaces her fingers with Agatha's and leans her head on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How I'll do it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And of course— <em>of course</em> Agatha keeps it vague. Rio hums. "And?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, it's a surprise, my love," Agatha shrugs, still glaring at the guy across the bar.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Looking forward to the show, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At that, Agatha glances at her for a moment, and it has Rio shifting in her seat. She becomes incredibly aware of just how wet she is, her breath hitching.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's heart races with the anticipation of actually, really <em>watching her</em>. Sure, she had watched Agatha kill her mother, but this is different. Tonight isn't impulsive, tonight is planned, thought through, and each of Agatha's moves will be chosen due to the fact that Rio is watching. Each little glance, each word, each breath, it's all for Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's about ten at night when the guy makes his move to leave. He gives them both a not-so-subtle glance as he walks past them to the door, and the moment he turns back, Agatha's stood up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She takes a hold of Rio's wrist, then carefully pulls her through the bar and outside. They catch sight of him, walking down a dim alleyway.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The plan had been to follow him to a secluded area, hide the body, then go home and fuck. But Agatha gets just a little carried away. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hardly waiting for the alley to get any darker as they follow the guy, Agatha catches up to him and shoves him into the wall by his shoulder. She can feel Rio's eyes on her, burning into her back and sending shocks of heat between her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, what— the fuck?" God, he's so fucking drunk he has no idea what's going on. This would be much more fun if he was sober.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stares at him for a moment, taking deep breaths and trying to control herself before she kills a man in a relatively public place.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha feels a pair of soft, warm hands on her waist, followed by Rio's body pressing against her back. "Go on, cariño." Rio whispers, her words enveloping over Agatha's ear like a gentle blanket.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shudders a little, tuning out the sound of the man's confused demands to let him go. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a knife— her personal favourite. Usually, she wouldn't carry knives with her, but when the urges got worse, she would carry one <em>just in case.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And, tonight, that had worked in her favour.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hands shift down to Agatha's hips, her thumbs rubbing small circles into the skin. She uses the hold to grind her hips down a little, a small whimper falling into Agatha's ear with the pressure. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Make it messy for me, mi cielito." Rio husks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's just about to do something, stab him, but then his disgusting voice rings out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, no— I— I didn't know." He stammers. "I just saw a pretty woman and—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha scoffs. "You saw a pretty, <em>married</em> woman, who <em>told you</em> she's married, and yet..."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry!" He suddenly cries.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head. "This pretty woman is <em>mine</em> and you put your <em>horrible</em> hands on her." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio exhales shakily behind her, the breath hitting Agatha's throat with a steady rhythm. She can't fucking believe this is happening— she has to constantly bite at her lip to remind herself it's real because <em>holy shit, Agatha's killing someone for me and I get to watch.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She was asking for it!" The man suddenly counters.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, then says sarcastically, "Yeah, I'm sure she was. I'm sure she wanted you to touch her with your grubby hands."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She did! She never said no." His voice is shaking— he knows damn well he's lying.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, but she did. And then you put your hands on her anyway." Agatha sighs deeply, twirling the knife around her fingers, tracing the sharp blade with her index finger.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Let's make sure that never happens again, hm?" She says condescendingly. And slowly, almost teasingly, she grabs one of his hands and roughly pins it to the wall. She reaffirms her hold on the knife and wedges it into his wrist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio gasps softly from beside her, taking in the sight of Agatha pushing the knife deeper, so deep that it cuts the entire way through his wrist. As it's cut through, his arm falls back down to the side as blood oozes out of his wrist and splashes onto the floor, creating a puddle of red.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Still, keeping the mans detached hand in hers, Agatha frowns. "You're making <em>far</em> too much noise. Here," She roughly shoves his hand into his own mouth, holding his chin shut and forcing him to hold it there. "Much better."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He groans in pain, and thank God it's muffled because Agatha takes his other hand and painstakingly repeats the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This time, with his other hand, she holds it and waves it around. "There. Now you can't touch people without their consent anymore." Carelessly, she chucks it down the alley, then pries the other hand out from his mouth and throws that, too. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He starts to get a little limp against the wall, the groans of pain subsiding into heavy breathing as he gets familiarised with it. So, Agatha holds him up with her free hand, by his throat and forces him to look at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He sobs, fighting to keep his eyes open with the overwhelming sensation of having <em>no hands</em>. "Please don't— I— please—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, but you're asking for it." Agatha pouts mockingly, holding the knife up to his chest. She then hears a soft <em>fuck</em> from behind her, hears Rio's trembling breaths, pull of anticipation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's all Agatha needs to let go— she doesn't hesitate to lodge the knife into the right side of his chest, not wanting to kill him just yet. In the process, she ruptures an artery, causing blood to spray from his chest in a steady stream.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The hands gripping her hips tighten for a moment, before sliding up to her waist and curling around her, holding her firmer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Suprirsingly, and <em>thankfully</em>, the man hasn't made much noise at all. Thank God he was practically blackout drunk already, he's hardly reacted to the knife in his chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches the blood spill from the wound for a few moments, listening to the sounds of Rio's shakey breaths in her ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's it," Rio murmurs, "my good girl."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers involuntarily. Her hips jerk back a little into Rio, and at this point, she would do fucking anything as long as Rio called her <em>her good girl</em> again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Keep going, give me more." Rio purrs, and, God, Agatha's going to lose her fucking control if Rio keeps talking to her like that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha abruptly rips the knife out from his chest, a small grunt dropping from her lips. She then feels one of Rio's hands cup her cheek from behind, gathering some blood on her face just to smear it over Agatha's skin, down her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio moves her hand back down to join the other at Agatha's waist when she feels her wife's back arch away from her. It reminds Agatha to keep going, to give Rio <em>more</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, she tilts his chin up. But instead of regularly slitting his throat, she drags the knife down vertically. When she reaches the hollow of his throat, she pushes it in, bringing a choked out gasp from him, followed by <em>more blood</em> spilling down his body.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good." Rio breathes. "You're doing so good, baby, I'm so proud of you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers, and for a second, her head drops back to rest on Rio's shoulder. With that, Rio grazes her lips over every inch of skin she can reach on Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Keep going." Rio says, her tone gentle but firm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, that's exactly what Agatha does. She pulls the knife out and moves it down to his stomach, pushing it in with a wet squelching sound. The man's body goes fully limp against the wall, succumbing to his own death, but Agatha keeps holding it up— <em>keeps stabbing him.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the time she's done, and by the time she lets his body drop down the brick wall of the alley, Rio's hands are shaking with need. Agatha drops the knife beside them, leaving it clanging against the rocky pavement of the alley.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the firm grip on her hips, Rio turns Agatha around to look her in the eye. She can't help but murmur a desperate, "Oh, my God."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's bloody hands reach up and cup Rio's cheeks, leaving two broken handprints on her face. "Did you enjoy the show?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her words are said in a teasing, sultry manner, but Rio catches the subtle hesitation— the worry behind them. The worry Rio's felt, time and time again. The worry that she'll scare her off.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio responds by pulling Agatha flush against her, so close that even in the almost pure darkness of the alley, they can see the utter need in eachother's eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Very much." Rio murmurs, and that must have been all Agatha needed because just a second later, Agatha's lips are on hers and she's backed into the wall of the alley.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The kiss is messy— desperate, but there's a tenderness behind each movement that has them both breathless. With a careful precision, Agatha seperates Rio's legs with her own, pressing her thigh up to her wife's core and grabbing her hips, pulling her across the muscle.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio moans against Agatha's lips and grinds down, completely forgetting where they are— all she can think about is Agatha. Then, Agatha slides her hand from Rio's hip to the button of her trousers, impatiently undoing it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At that moment, Rio seems to remember the fact that they're in a dark alley, in <em>public</em>, right opposite a <em>dead fucking body</em>. She breaks the kiss and places a palm on Agatha's wrist gently stopping her for a moment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Here? We're gonna get caught." Rio mutters, glancing to the entrance of the alley, where it's much lighter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs shakily, her forehead coming to rest on Rio's. "Not if we're quiet."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes flutter shut, threading her free hand into Agatha's hair, while the other holds her wrist tighter with the adrenaline coursing through her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If you'd rather go home, that's okay, but I need you <em>so</em> fucking bad—" Agatha's cut off by her own whimper as Rio suddenly spins them, shoving Agatha against the wall with a thud.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's mouth falls open with a gasp when Rio uses the hold on her wrist to pin it to the wall, while the other smears the blood around Agatha's skin. It coats Rio's fingers in it, and Rio isn't sure she's ever seen Agatha look as beautiful as she does now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A part of her dreads the moment they go home, having to walk through town with two bloody handprints on Rio's face, and blood smudged all over Agatha's. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio decides that's a problem for later. There are <em>much</em> more important things to focus on right now. Like, her gorgeous wife pinned to the wall infront of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's free hand, the one coated in blood, slides down to Agatha's trousers, unbuttoning them. "Keep quiet for me, querida." And before Agatha can reply with a dazed nod, Rio shoves her hand beneath her wife's underwear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio glides two desperate, bloody fingers between Agatha's folds, gathering her arousal before pushing them inside of her. It brings a moan out from her— much too loud for where they are, so Rio muffles it with a deep kiss, slipping her tongue into her wife's mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Rio starts to move her fingers, thrusting at a slow, steady— almost teasing pace, Agatha breaks the kiss and drops her head onto Rio's shoulder. A few small breathy moans cascade from Agatha's mouth, tightening her grip in Rio's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So good, baby, I'm so proud." Rio praises softly, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the intentions of keeping Agatha quiet, Rio motions to place her free palm over her mouth, but in the last moment, Agatha grabs her wrist and guides two of her wife's blood-stained fingers into her mouth. She sucks the red off of her fingers, and it results in more noise than if Rio hadn't tried to cover her mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh, mi vida," Rio murmurs against Agatha's throat, pulling her fingers from her mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's almost cruel, asking Agatha to stay perfectly silent all while Rio curls her fingers the way that has Agatha's legs trembling with the pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rests her head back against the wall, arching her back and rolling her hips into Rio's touch. Everything else disappears— the occasional group of people walking past the entrance to the alley, the dead body— everything's gone except Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath shudders. "Ri— Rio, <em>fuck,"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's it, good girl. So good— taking me so well."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Abruptly, Rio pulls her fingers out, but just as Agatha's about to complain, she re-enters her with a third. At this point, they've both sort of stopped caring about making noise, too worked up by eachother to recognise the consequences.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forwards and dips her head, mouthing at the flesh of Agatha's throat and licking up the blood, punctuating each stroke of her tongue with a gentle bite. As Rio feels Agatha clenching around her fingers, feels the muscles of her stomach tense, she notices a group of people far too close to the alley.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She places her palm flat against Agatha's mouth, tilting her head towards the group of people to signal Agatha of their presence. Though, Agatha makes no move to ask to stop, still rolling her hips into each of Rio's thrusts, her whimpers muffled by Rio's hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to be quiet when I let you come?" Rio whispers, angling her hand to allow Agatha the opportunity to repsond.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes," She rasps, "please, Ri."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Such good manners, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please, I'm so close." Agatha's voice breaks a little, tightening her hold further in Rio's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Let go for me, cariño." Rio mumbles, her words giving way to Agatha's climax.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The moment Agatha slumps against her, spent and exhausted, Rio wraps her arms around her and pulls her close. Rio only speaks when Agatha's breathing has slowed to normal.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you feeling okay?" She asks, fully assuming that Agatha's processed just how brutally she killed that man.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wanna fuck you." Is all Agatha says in response.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles lightly, gently stroking a hand, soaked with blood and come, through Agatha's hair. "That can wait, mi corazón, you're tired. We should go home— shower."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, honey, I love how sweet you are but the only thing that's going to stop me is you telling me not to." Agatha lifts her head up and places her hands back on Rio's face, reinforcing the red handprints.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers at the sincerity in Agatha's tone. She nods, then pulls Agatha closer to kiss her again. But Agatha places a hand on Rio's sternum, stopping her from closing the distance fully. She uses her hold on her wife to spin them back around and pin her to the alley wall, catching sight of the dead body opposite them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Then</em>, Agatha kisses her. She threads her fingers into Rio's hair and tugs on it, exposing her neck so that she can dip down and mouth at the flesh. Rio bites at her lip so hard she almost draws blood, all attempting to stay quiet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's about to <em>ravage her</em>— Rio can feel it in each of Agatha's touches, the small whimpers she occasionally lets out. Her back arches as Agatha trails a hand down Rio's torso, roughly undoing the buckle of the belt on her hips, then unbuttoning her jeans and shoving her hand beneath her underwear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just about manages to stifle a moan, and it instead comes out as a sharp inhale as her hips buck into Agatha's hand. "Oh, <em>fuck,"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's so desperate to make her come that she doesn't even tease her, just slides one, then two, then three fingers inside of her, stretching her deliciously, but not yet moving them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to keep quiet for me?" Agatha murmurs, nudging their noses together to further gain Rio's attention.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." She gasps out, rolling her hips to try to encourage her wife into moving her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instead of thrusting her three fingers, Agatha curls them to press against that perfect, soft spot inside of her. It draws a quiet mewl from Rio's lips, proving just how much effort she's putting into staying quiet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cups Rio's cheek with her free hand, gently brushing her thumb over the now dried bloody handprints on her face. "You're so fucking beautiful. All mine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio whimpers under her breath as Agatha doesn't thrust her fingers, but just rubs them against Rio's g-spot, providing her a continuous onslaught of pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh." Agatha reminds her, leaning close enough that their lips are brushing, but they aren't quite kissing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The closest Rio can get to being silent is shakey, stuttering breaths coupled with the occasional soft whimper. It's good enough for Agatha, who presses just a little firmer on the spot inside of her, working her quicker to the edge.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's it, baby, you're so good for me, I love you." She murmurs under her breath, her words a mere whisper into Rio's open, gasping mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chokes out her response between quiet moans, "I— I love you, too." Before leaning forwards and burying her head in the crook of Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My perfect, <em>bloody</em> girl." Agatha muses, almost to herself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio lets out a slightly louder moan at the comment, and Agatha's free hand curls around to Rio's back. She gently rubs circles into the fabric of her shirt, lightly grazing with her nails.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're being <em>so</em> good for me. Too bad we aren't home or I'd mark you up with that knife,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shudders in her arms, clenching around Agatha's fingers, still steadily rubbing inside of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You want that, sweetheart? Want me to make you bleed for me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All Rio can do is nod and bite her lip because if she opens her mouth, she's going to make far too much noise while in public.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Such a good, <em>good</em> girl, my love." Agatha mutters. "My Rio."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That's what pushes Rio over the edge, coming with a silent scream and digging her nails into Agatha's back to keep herself steady. Agatha's fingers slow inside of her, gently pulling out with a wet sound that fills their ears. Rio bites back a whine with suddenly feeling empty, instead wrapping her arms tighter around Agatha and pulling her close.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Their moment of quiet bliss lasts for approximately a minute before Agatha pulls away a little, trying to turn around. She laughs a little, though, as Rio pulls her back with a groan of protest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," She mumbles, "there's a body six feet from us, we need to do something."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." She nods, but makes no move to let go of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Baby, you can hold me all night and all day tomorrow if you so wish," Agatha says, teasing her gently, but knowing the impact of her words still land, "but we need to dispose of this body."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio groans again and thuds her head against the brick wall. A little overdramatic if you ask Agatha. "Fine." She grumbles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The disposal of the body is a tricky one. There are too many people around in the main streets to take it anywhere else, so they're stuck with the alley. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, together, they move the body from it's space by the wall, further into the darkness of the alley. There, they find a large dumpster, large enough for a body to fit in relatively unnoticed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They have the bright idea of setting it on fire after taking for steps away from the dumpster. The dumpster which contained a mutilated body, and said mutilated body's detached hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A little arson never hurt anyone, right? It's not like they're burning a whole house down. Just a random dumpster in an alleyway. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, they set it on fire and take as many discreet, back ways home as possible. They end up needing to walk past maybe three people in total, but they keep their heads down and keep their hands in their pockets.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn't sure how, but between the time from getting home to getting upstairs, Rio convinced her to join her for a shower before bed. Though, it didn't take <em>much</em> convincing. Agatha rarely turned down a shower with her wife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha had expected, Rio takes her precious time cleaning the blood from Agatha's body, leaving no spot untouched. She washes Agatha's hair and rakes her hands through it, gently untangling it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha does the same. She washes the handprints off of Rio's face, despite how good she looks with them, and washes her hair with a tenderness that shouldn't be possible for two murderers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How are you feeling?" Rio asks, her fingers tracing the <em>R</em> scar on Agatha's chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You need to stop worrying about me, my love." Agatha responds with a soft laugh. "I'm okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just okay?" She leans forwards, brushing her lips over the hollow of her wife's throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fine, not just <em>okay</em>. I feel good. Really good." She sighs. "It isn't your fault."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I know." Rio nods. "You looked so fucking good when you did it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha threads her hands into Rio's hair. "Yeah?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't reply with words. Instead, she takes a hold of Agatha's chin and tilts her head so their lips can meet in a soft kiss. Agatha hums, parting her lips against Rio's to deepen the kiss, curling her tongue against the top of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers, her free hand sliding down to trace the scar on Agatha's chest, then cup one of her breasts and gently knead the flesh. When Agatha arches her back into the touch with a soft whine, Rio backs her against the wall, allowing the warm water to cascade over their bodies.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio breaks the kiss, dipping her head to take over from her hand and circle her wife's nipple with her tongue. Her hand then slides down to Agatha's inner thigh, but doesn't move from there— awaiting permission.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's permission that Agatha quickly and silently gives, placing her hand over Rio's and guiding it higher until she's cupping her core. Both of Agatha's hands then curl into Rio's hair, pulling and tugging her forwards into her chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio then gently sucks her nipple, swirling her tongue, and simultaneously starts to circle Agatha's clit with the same steady rhythm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, Rio," Agatha breathes, her head falling back into the cold tiles of the shower.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It stays slow. Coaxing, but not teasing. Rio simply wants to take her time, draw out her wife's pleasure— <em>worship her.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha is <em>not</em> complaining. She rolls her hips into Rio's hand as little whimpers and squeaks fall from her lips. She strokes Rio's hair as she sucks and marks the flesh of her breasts. And she feels her climax approaching quickly, despite the soft touches her wife's providing her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her breath hitches, "I'm— Ri, baby, I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unexpectedly, Rio pauses the movement between Agatha's legs, before resuming at an even <em>slower</em> pace. It keeps her so impossibly close to falling over the edge without actually letting her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha releases a breathless moan. "Rio, please,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh, mi amor, breathe. Let me make you feel good." She murmurs, shifting her attention to Agatha's other breast and tracing circles over her nipple with her tongue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sweetheart," She urges, her hips jerking involuntarily into Rio's hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're so good for me," Rio says, moving her head up to brush her lips over Agatha's. "So good."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please." She whispers, hardly audible over the sound of the shower.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With that, Rio moves her fingers faster again, "Come for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha does, immediately. Her breath shudders and she moans loudly, dropping her head onto Rio's shoulder. "Fuck,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There you go." Rio coos, finally leaning forwards and closing the distance with a tender kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They're in bed only ten minutes later, curled into eachother with their legs entangled. Neither of them have fallen asleep, only basking in the feel of eachother against them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After what feels like another ten minutes, Agatha feels herself start to drift off. She's probably only seconds from falling asleep when she hears Rio's voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe we should... try to stop." She murmurs. It's shy, almost as if she isn't sure of it herself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Huh?" Agatha frowns, and while she has an idea of what Rio's referring to, she needs to hear Rio say it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Like, stop... killing people." And when an uncomfortable silence follows, Rio continues. "It's a lot of people, Agatha, if we get caught we'll never see eachother again."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, shaking her head, and pulls out of Rio's hold. It makes Rio instantly regret saying anything. Agatha looks up at the ceiling and takes a deep, exasperated breath.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I literally <em>just</em> fucking killed a guy. You told me to—" She sighs, closing her eyes. "You— you told me to make it messy for you. You said I was a good girl, you said you were <em>proud</em> and— and now you want us to <em>stop?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." Rio cuts in before Agatha can say anything else. "It just sort of... hit me. This is the third person you've killed."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't care." Agatha replies, refusing to look at Rio. Her voice is a little shakey with the effort of not turning this into a full blown argument. "He deserved it, he was harrassing you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>An awkward silence falls over them, and that's when Agatha looks over at her wife, who's now looking at the ceiling. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you saying he didn't deserve it?" Agatha asks. "That I shouldn't have—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Rio says quickly, moving her focus from the ceiling to her wife. "That's not— I'm saying I'm scared, cariño. I can't lose you, I don't want us to spend the rest of out lives in seperate prisons because we get too careless."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha unintentionally raises her voice a little when she responds, "We aren't careless, we—" She catches the glassiness of Rio's eyes, the small tears threatening to fall, and takes a breath. "Sorry."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I never said we were." Rio says, ignoring her wife's apology. "But I don't want one of us to make a mistake and— and get arrested. I can't— I can't lose you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's gaze softens, and she takes another deep breath before shuffling closer to Rio again and tentatively curling into her. She isn't going to start an argument over this when Rio is literally<em> shaking in her hold.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay," Agatha says softly, stroking Rio's hair, "but what if it makes us feel worse?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And what if it makes us feel better in the long run?" Rio counters, her voice breaking a little. "Look, I just... I know it feels good. Fuck, I really do, but I'm scared, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I... okay. Fine. We can try." She nods, pressing a kiss to her forehead.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." Rio breathes. "Just— talk to me. Tell me how you're feeling. Tell me if things get worse, okay? Promise me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I promise. And <em>you</em> promise that you'll talk to me, too."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I promise." Rio says, tangling their legs together again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Since..." Agatha hesitates a little, "since you started killing people, what's the longest you've gone without doing it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs. "About two months."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha nods. "And you did it again, because...?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because the urges got too much. I was scared that—" She cuts herself off. She is <em>not</em> going to talk to Agatha about that, not now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Scared that what?" Agatha asks softly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head. "Nothing. Not now."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. We're gonna be okay, my love." She pulls her closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love <em>you</em>, sugar."</p>

<p>Their little agreement lasts for, surprisingly, almost a year. Each month, they have a small celebration for reaching a new milestone, despite how shitty it makes them feel.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without the relatively regular killing— two or three victims between them every month— it's left them with <em>constant</em> urges. At first, it's somewhat bareable, like how the urges usually were. The five month mark is when it started to take a bigger toll.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The nightmares. It starts out as simple kills, faceless people. But the problem really started when it turns into almost <em>every night</em>. It's like some sort of sick and twisted race for who woke up hyperventilating first.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The first full blown panic attack over the whole <em>stopping killing people</em> comes as a surprise to both of them. It's about six months in, and they had simply been cooking dinner together when Agatha suddenly rushes out, into the bathroom and locks the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio follows, a little confused, and softly knocks on the bathroom door. Agatha's crying on the other side. It's muffled, but she can hear it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha?" She calls out quietly, but no reply comes. Just crying.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She knocks again. "Will you please let me in, mi amor?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A small, weak <em>I can't</em> is heard from inside. Rio feels it ache in her chest. And she knocks<em> again.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please, cariño. You don't have to talk about it, just— just let me be with you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And she waits. She waits for what feels like forever listening to her wife sobbing in the bathroom, but in reality it's only thirty seconds. The moment the door unlocks, Rio rushes inside and kneels beside Agatha. Now, inside, Rio can hear the shakiness in her breathes, the desperate gasps for air.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, it's okay—" She tries to comfort her, but the moment Rio's knelt infront of her, Agatha leans forwards and collapses into her, wrapping her arms around her waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," Agatha chokes out, and it only has Rio's heart breaking more.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh, mi amor, respira por mi. Breathe. Está bien."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head against Rio's shoulder. "Can't."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gently, slowly, Rio pulls back and cups Agatha's cheeks, continuously wiping the tears away. One of her hands curls around, stroking her wife's hair and muttering sweet nothings.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Breathe with me, mi vida, I've got you. Estoy aquí." She murmurs, then moves her free hand to hold Agatha's guiding it to rest over Rio's heart. "It's alright."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha's breathes become more deep and shakey than gasping, and while Rio's grateful for that, it isn't enough for a conversation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're okay." Rio exhales deeply and guides Agatha's head back onto her shoulder. "Breathe, that's it, you're doing amazing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just shakes her head again. The tears continue to steadily flow, and by this point Rio's shirt is soaked but she can't bring herself to care. All that matters is Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's okay." Rio whispers as Agatha calms slightly. She presses a kiss to the top of her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, my love." Agatha rasps out, just barely audible.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That night, they speak about what had caused if. Agatha insists she doesn't know, but it's painfully clear she's lying. It's about their agreement and they both know it, they're just a little too scared to admit it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally comes clean two weeks later after another panic attack. They come to the conclusion that it's best to try to give it more time, because maybe that's what they need. But they both know it isn't.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At around the nine month mark, the even bigger problem is that their nightmares would often include them killing <em>eachother</em>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It fucking <em>terrifies</em> them. Not seeing eachother again after being caught and arrested would be one thing, but <em>losing control and killing the other?</em> Just because they're so desperate for the high of killing?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Not worth it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, the fifth night after their <em>eleven months without murder party,</em> neither of them sleep. Each of them lay, simply holding eachother, as if that way, they wouldn't kill eachother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's holding Agatha as they lay in bed. Her front is pressed to Agatha's back, both of her arms around her waist while her face is buried in her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All she can think about is <em>murder</em>. The spilling of the blood, the life draining from someone's eyes, the way the body goes limp.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her breath hitches at the sound of her wife's voice, so weak and small that it worries her. "Mhm?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't think this is working." She mutters, taking one of Rio's hands and stroking her thumb over her knuckles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What's not working?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You know what I'm talking about." Agatha sighs. "We haven't slept in three days because we're so scared that we'll have another nightmare about murdering eachother."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio exhales, her breath trembling. She loosens her hold a little and encourages Agatha to turn around in her arms, to face her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, we...we can't do this." She continues quietly, reaching a hand up to cup Rio's cheek. "It's breaking us."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." Rio nods, closing her eyes for a moment, then repeating under her breath, "I know."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What if we just..." She shrugs, "do it one more time?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha..."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio." Agatha holds her face a little firmer, contrasting the softness of her voice. "It's <em>breaking</em> us."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't want to lose you. Don't want to get arrested."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And <em>I</em> don't want to lose control and end your life."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mi vida—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, please." Agatha whispers. "Just...one more time."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When only a sigh comes from Rio as a response, Agatha shifts her hands into her wife's hair and gently combs through it with her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Baby, we've been having panic attacks regularly for <em>five months</em>, and it's getting worse, you know it is."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe we just need more time." Rio shrugs, her voice wavering.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs and closes her eyes. "Sweetheart, there won't <em>be</em> more time if we lose control."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's jaw tenses. A tear falls.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, my love, this... I love you and I know you're scared about getting caught, but if I <em>killed</em> <em>you</em> after losing control—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio cuts her off with an involuntarily sob, and Agatha quickly pulls into her arms, guiding her face to the crook of her neck. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha mutters under her breath, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to—" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know, it's— it's okay." Rio sighs. "You're right. You were always right, I was stupid to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sweetheart, you weren't stupid." Agatha's quick to comfort her, holding her tighter. "Neither of us knew how this would go, okay? We tried, don't blame yourself." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's all my fault," Rio's voice is trembling, "the nightmares, the— the panic attacks."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, it isn't." Agatha argues softly. "You didn't know. It's okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, I want— I need to do it again so badly." Rio sighs, but she now has that defeated tone in her voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." Agatha strokes her hair. "So do I. It's all I've been able to think about." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds her until her sobs have broken into small, shakey breaths, until Rio breathes, "Just one more time." And while Rio says the words, they both know damn well it isn't going to be <em>just one more time. </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We can talk properly in the morning, okay, when we've had some sleep." Agatha utters, then adds softly. "Try to get some, my love."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They each managed approximately two hours of sleep. But of course, the next day, they don't actually speak of it until after Rio's come home from work. The plan was, initially, to talk in the <em>morning</em>, like Agatha had said, but they both found themselves too nervous to bring it up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At quater to five, now that's it's reached half an hour before Rio's due home, Agatha waits in the living room, sat on the sofa with her face in her hands. She spends the entire time trying to run through what she's going to say, but before she knows it, she's spiralled into a worry that Rio's changed her mind— that she'll say it's a bad idea and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The door unlocks. Agatha jolts up a little, turning around and catching Rio entering the house, the look on her face. She watches as Rio takes her boots off and places them neatly by the door, then slips off her coat and hangs it up, and drops the keys into the little bowl on the desk beside the coat stand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My love," Agatha calls from the living room, "we should talk before we avoid it again."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, just—" Rio clears her throat, not taking one glance at her, "give me a second."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Frowning, Agatha then watches as her wife essentially jogs into the kitchen. But, despite the worry building in her chest, she gives Rio a second and makes herself more comfortable on the sofa.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, when it's reached the fifth minute and Rio <em>isn't</em> back, Agatha stands up and strolls to the kitchen. She's met with Rio leaning on the counter which Evanora's body had lay fifteen months ago. Her hands are gripping the edges of it and she's so hunched over that Agatha worries she may be sick.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sweetheart?" Agatha takes a few steps closer until she can hear the deep, shakey breaths Rio's taking in.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, shaking her head. Her words are rushed, wavering, when she says, "I'll be there in a minute."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, what's going on?" Agatha asks, now stood directly beside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Need to breathe." Is all Rio responds with, but Agatha sees the problem immediately. Rio's actively trying to stop herself from having a panic attack.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha nods understandingly. "Do you want me to stay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can only really hum with the affirmative before muttering, "Hold me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There isn't any world where Agatha would deny that, so she steps forwards and collects Rio in her arms, one around her waist and the other around her shoulders, stroking her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're okay," Agatha murmurs, "it's okay. Match my breathing, sugar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes another few minutes, and a couple tears, but Rio manages to calm her breathing to match her wife's. Her heart rate slows to a regular pace, and she takes one last deep breath before actually looking up at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you alright?" Agatha asks. Her hands quickly come up to cup Rio's cheeks, her thumbs brushing away stray tears.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I'm just— I— I'm fine." She shakes her head with a small smile. It's clear she doesn't want to focus on this, so Agatha doesn't.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instead, she asks, "Are you okay to talk about last night?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." Rio nods, then takes Agatha's hand and leads her back into the living room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They sit on opposite sides of the sofa, leaning against the arms of it and facing eachother. Their legs lay in eachother's laps, tangled together. To talk about <em>this</em>, they each want a little more space— breathing room, but not enough to not touch eachother at all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So..." Agatha draws the word out, unsure of how to start, "have you changed your mind? About... doing it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a moment before shaking her head. "No, I think— I think we... need to. It's gotten too much. You're right, it's breaking us."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I mean we haven't fucked in three weeks because we've been so exhausted." Agatha huffs a hollow laugh, and her eyebrows pull together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I think we should do it tonight." Rio blurts out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pauses and searches Rio's face for any uncertainty. "T—Tonight?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She simply nods, then rests her hands over Agatha's shins and subconsciously massages as the flesh. If Rio hears the hitch in Agatha's breath, she doesn't mention it. Besides, now is <em>not</em> the time, and, as Agatha said, they're <em>much</em> too exhausted to fuck right now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Though, they know they'll find some sort of energy— probably the adrenaline for after they undoubtedly kill people tonight, and then they're going to sleep like kittens later. It's going to be amazing. <em>Refreshing</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, then exhales sharply. "Are you sure?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, I don't want to lose control and murder my wife. I need to do it," Rio says, continuing to knead the flesh of Agatha's calf, "and so do you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah," She nods again, "I really do." Then, she slips her eyes closed and places her head in her hands with a sigh. "God, I'm so sorry."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What— why?" Rio's brows knit together in a frown. "What are you sorry for?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because I'm— I can't <em>stop</em> and I'm— I'm greedy and desperate and <em>selfish—"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hey," Rio reaches forwards and places gentle hands on her wife's wrists, then mutters, "no, you're not. You're not selfish, <em>or</em> greedy."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her hands down and clasps them over Rio's, holding them in her lap.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You may be a <em>little</em> desperate," Rio huffs a laugh, earning a watery one out of her wife, "but that's because it's been <em>eleven months</em>."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sinks back into the sofa slightly, tightening her grip on Rio's hands and fighting back the few tears threatening to escape.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Listen, let's have dinner, okay? Then we can go out to the park after sundown and find someone."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Only one?" Agatha asks, brushing a thumb over Rio's knuckle. "Shouldn't— do you... I— I think— maybe one each would be...better?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Whatever you need." Rio says. "If you think one between us won't be enough, we can do one each."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Agatha nods, nervously chewing at her lip with the anticipation. "Yeah, that... I think one each is best. For me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank God, because I'd rather have one to myself, too." It earns Rio another soft chuckle from Agatha, who leans forwards and captures her lips in a chaste kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After dark, they go out to the park that they'd usually go to. The first person they find walking through the park is a man in maybe his mid-fourties. He has dirty blonde hair, is wearing awful clothes. They've been following him for five minutes, their fingers intertwined.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They're both nervous— and rightfully so. It's been almost a year since they last took someone's life, the thought of doing it in just five minutes time overwhelms them, let alone actually doing it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want to..." Agatha starts to ask, but the words get lost in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Would you rather go first?" Rio asks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Okay, this is strangely awkward. What the fuck is going on? They've done this numerous times before, why are they so suddenly incapable of asking who wants to kill someone first?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clears her throat quietly so that the man doesn't hear her. "I... do <em>you</em> want to go first?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— yeah, I can." Rio nods, then takes the knife out of her pocket. "Unless you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, sugar, I've waited eleven months. Another fifteen minutes won't hurt." She then gestures to the guy a few paces infront to them, and turns her tone sickeningly sweet. "Go on, superstar. Kill him for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio goes first without further question, because she'll do anything Agatha tells her to. She's typically quicker compared to Agatha, who likes to take her time, who treats it like a piece of art— something to be displayed in a museum. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And of course, they watch eachother, even if it's from a distance. Agatha watches Rio quicken her pace until she's just behind the man. She takes one last glance at Agatha before lifting the knife up and thrusting it right into the gap between his shoulder blades.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A small whimper falls from Agatha's lips, who's now walking up to Rio to get a better view. <em>Fuck</em>, she forgot how much she loves to watch her. Rio kneels down, grabbing the back of the mans head and forcing him into laying on his stomach. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>His groans of pain and struggles for his life are ignored— blurred, as Agatha kneels down beside Rio and places a hand on the small of her back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Again, sweetheart." Agatha husks, hardly registering her own words. She can feel her wife's shakey intake of breath, and watches as Rio does exactly as she said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stabs him again, this time a little higher, edging more toward his neck. "Fuck, I missed this."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All Agatha can do in response is release a breathy mewl— she can't find any words other than that of encouragement, not when Rio's right infront of her, killing a man.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls the knife out with a soft whimper, watching as the blood starts to leak from the wound. She stares and stares— watching as the blood oozes into a puddle. The man's long dead, but she just keeps staring, like she wants to— </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches a hand out and grasps Rio's, then manoeuvres it until it's flat, and lays Rio's hand flat over the wound on the man's back. Rio's breath catches, but she doesn't pull away. She just holds it there, under the weight of Agatha's hand, and watches as the blood seeps around her fingers, coating them in that deep red she's so infatuated with.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It doesn't compare to Agatha's blood. Nothing can, nothing ever will. But she can't have it, not like this. It's far too dangerous for Agatha to lose this amount of blood, and Rio knows that. But just picturing having Agatha's blood coat her hand like this, wet and sticky, she feels a rush of heat through her body.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Neither of them are sure how long they kneel there, watching the man bleed out. They want to just stay lost in this forever, but then Rio remembers the drill. Remembers that there's a dead body right infront of them and they need to do something with it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's the first to move. She lifts her hand from Rio's, and with her other— clean one, she brushes a strand of Rio's hair behind her ear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, I need you so bad." She breathes, moving closer until her lips brush Rio's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just chuckles softly. "More than you need to kill someone?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I hate you." She groans, because Agatha unfortunately <em>does</em> need to kill someone more than she needs to fuck her wife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She laughs, "I love you, too." Before instinctively grabbing Agatha's face with both hands— <em>yes</em>, even the one which is soaked in blood— and pressing a hard, deep kiss to her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite it being short, Agatha finds herself moaning into the kiss upon feeling the wetness of the blood on her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When they break apart, Agatha rests her forehead on Rio's. "I would absolutely fuck you <em>right now,</em> but I <em>desperately</em> need to kill someone."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And you know I love to watch." Rio caresses Agatha's cheeks with her thumbs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I hope that you know that the sex is going to be <em>mind-blowing</em> later."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I know." She nods, taking Agatha's hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They put more effort than usual into disposing of the body. Only because of their worries for getting caught because otherwise they'd do it as quick as possible, move on to the next, and then go home and fuck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tonight is different. It takes around half an hour, but they drag the body through the forest until they find a bramble bush. They find a small opening and throw the body inside, because, even if someone smelt a dead body inside a bramble bush, who would go inside and look?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hopefully, no one. Because neither Agatha nor Rio would particularly like the idea of ending their eleven-month hiatus from murder, and recieving a life sentence a few days later.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They find Agatha's victim a few minutes later. It's a slightly younger guy than the last one. Like the last one, though, they follow him for a few minutes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you ready?" Rio asks, holding the used knife out to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without anything but a nod, Agatha takes the knife from her wife and catches up to the man infront of them. She hadn't exactly thought about how she would do it, much too caught up in the fact that she was <em>finally going to do it</em> to actually care how.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, she just grabs him by the back of his coat collar and roughly drags him down onto the floor. He only has a few seconds to be perplexed before Agatha kneels down with one knee resting on his sternum, keeping him in place.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before he can say anything or call for help, Agatha thrusts the knife directly into his throat. He writhes for about four seconds, then his body goes limp. Agatha doesn't usually do it this quickly, but she was fucking <em>desperate</em>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the time that she had gotten him on the floor and stabbed him, Rio must have made her way to them, because Agatha feels a warm, trembling hand on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Keep going." Rio commands quietly, her voice wavering.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha dislodges the knife from the man's throat and focuses on the feeling of Rio's hand tightening as she stabs him again. She repeats the motion until his throat is all ripped and mangled, and until her hands are covered in his blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, silence. A silence which is broken by each of their heavy, shaking breaths. Rio urges Agatha to turn around with a hand at her chin, holding her face close to her own, but doesn't kiss her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We need to hide this <em>right now</em>, because if I can't fuck you within the hour I'm going to explode." Rio husks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath hitches, but she doesn't act affected, shrugging, "Fine by me." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They manage to hide the body within twenty-two minutes. It would have been much quicker if the head hadn't dropped off when the body was picked up. Maybe Agatha should've stabbed somewhere <em>other than</em> the throat. Too late, now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio drags Agatha home within seven minutes. The moment the front door is closed, she has Agatha up against it and pulls her into a messy kiss. They haven't touched eachother like this in <em>weeks</em>, they're both incredibly worked up already.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Rio pulls away and grabs her wife's wrists, impatiently pulling her upstairs. On their way up, they each rip and pull their clothes off, leaving pieces strewn across the house, landing on random lamps, drooped over the top of open doors.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once in their bedroom, reduced to their bras and underwear, Rio guides Agatha to lay on her back in the centre of the bed. Rio, who's kept hold of the bloodied knife the entire time, straddles her wife's thighs and lays the knife flat on her stomach, resting it there. It's left there, serving as a reminder, as she leans down and mouths at the <em>R</em> scar on Agatha's sternum.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, <em>please</em>, I want—" She cuts herself off with a whimper when Rio softly sucks a mark into the flesh of Agatha's breasts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What do you want, baby?" Rio asks, her hot breath fanning against Agatha's skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want to bleed for you," She whines impatiently, "please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio tuts, reaching around Agatha to unclasp her bra, "Patience, cariño."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Rio pulls the fabric away, flinging it somewhere across the room. She dips back down, laving her wife's chest with infinite attention, leaving her squirming beneath her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands thread into Rio's hair, tugging a little to get enough of her attention that she listens when she says, "Rio, sweetheart, please don't tease me, <em>please."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio, who had already been on the verge of breaking, completely snaps at the sound of her wife's whimpering pleas. Abruptly, she sits up and takes a firm hold of the knife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Safeword if you need to, mi amor." Is all Rio says before slicing a shallow cut into Agatha's lower stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, <em>fuck</em>, Rio," Agatha breathes out a soft whimper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It isn't like all of the knifeplay stopped with the murder— it <em>very much</em> carried on. In fact, without all the murder, they used the knife much more often. Until the <em>bad</em> nightmares. Like, the nightmares where they'd brutally murder eachother. <em>That's</em> when they stopped with the knife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, I missed this <em>so much,"</em> Agatha's back arches involuntarily as Rio shuffles down and settles between her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Though, unexpectedly, Agatha feels the blade of the knife against her inner thigh rather than Rio's mouth. Her breath catches, but she strokes through Rio's hair with a nod, a silent <em>yes, please</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio digs the knife into her thigh just a little. She's careful, as always, but it bleeds here <em>so much more</em> than anywhere else that she's cut. She cuts three shallow lines into Agatha's thigh, before dipping her head and collecting the blood on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio looks back up at Agatha, there's a trickle of blood dripping from her mouth to her neck— she's bitten her lip so hard she's drawn blood. Rio rises, still holding the knife in one hand, and clasps Agatha's chin with her free one.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gently, she parts Agatha's lips and pulls her mouth open, reveling in the way Agatha already flattens her tongue readily. Slowly, teasingly, Rio drips the blood mixed with her own saliva down onto Agatha's waiting tongue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At first contact, Agatha whimpers, and her hips jerk a little at the combination of the tastes. The moment Rio releases her mouth, Agatha closes her mouth and swirls her tongue around, savouring the taste, before swallowing it down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Such a good girl." Rio praises under her breath, completely in awe of her wife underneath her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, please fuck me." Agatha whines, arching her back in the hopes that it encourages her further.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Luckily, Rio caves immediately. She must be just as desperate as Agatha is. She quickly, impatiently removes Agatha's underwear, throwing them across the room. Then, she takes the knife and places it just on the bed next to Agatha, and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Agatha chokes out suddenly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow, tilting her head to the side. "No?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— <em>fuck."</em> Agatha groans frustratedly, closing her eyes, because <em>how</em> is she supposed to ask for what she wants?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me what you want, cariño." Rio murmurs, brushing their lips together with her words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck me with—" She cuts herself off before the words come out, sighing. Her next words are a whisper, "with the knife."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But Rio can't quite hear her, "With what?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The knife."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She frowns. "With the blade?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What? No, no, the— the handle, <em>fuck.</em>" Agatha sighs again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh! Fuck, okay. Yes." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio manoeuvres herself so that she's laying slightly on her side, propping herself up with her elbow and with one leg over Agatha's, keeping them spread open. She then flips the knife over in her hand, so that she's gripping it gently by the blade.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A whimper escapes Agatha the moment she feels the cold metal pressing against her clit. "Oh, God."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps the knife there for a moment, watching the way Agatha's face contorts with each increase in pressure. Her breath hitches when Agatha's eyes dart to hers, and when Rio can see just how dark they now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Keeping eye contact, Rio drags the knife down so that the handle is teasing at Agatha's entrance. She slides it between her folds for a moment, gathering wetness on the handle to ensure it won't hurt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio tightens her hold just slightly on the blade. "If at <em>any</em> point you need to stop—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know, my love, please fuck me." Agatha wraps her arms around Rio's waist, her nails already digging into her back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio slowly pushes the handle of the knife into her. It feels similar to simply having Rio strap her, smooth and rounded, but the knowledge that Rio's fucking her with the knife they both used to kill someone an hour ago—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once Agatha's taken it to the hilt, Rio has to grip the blade even tighter. She can feel it cut into her palm a little, the pads of her fingers, but none of that matters because all Rio wants right now is to hear all those beautiful sounds from Agatha's mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The thrusts start slow but deep, and Rio breaks eye contact for a moment to look down and see just how wet the handle is coming out, before plunging it deeper again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"F—faster, Rio, please—" Agatha whimpers, sliding one of her hands up into Rio's hair and dragging her to look up again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a quickened pace, the knife cuts into Rio's hand more, but she keeps fucking Agatha, she wants her to come like this. It isn't too surprising when Rio realises that Agatha's close. It's been weeks, after all, since they've fucked. Weeks of getting worked up but without enough energy to do something about it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, I n—I need more," Agatha begs, her eyes falling shut and her eyebrows knitting together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In response, Rio angles the knife a little differently so that the hilt nudges against Agatha's clit with each thrust. And a few moments later, Agatha's body seizes and she comes with a loud, relieved cry, clenching around the knife inside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio slows her pace to a stop, then pulls the knife out and lays it on the bed. She's about to reach up to Agatha's face with that hand, and brush some of the hair out of her face, but Agatha catches her wrist as she does.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Holy shit, are you okay?" Concern, and a small flicker of regret washes over her face. She turns Rio's hand so that she can clearly see all the dozens of cuts over her palm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Doesn't matter, I need to fuck you." Rio breathes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles softly, but keeps a gentle hold on Rio's cut hand. "You just did." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Again. Please. Can I?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, please," Agatha nods frantically, then adds, "with the strap?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Whatever you want, mi amor." She punctuates her words with a soft kiss to Agatha's lips, then climbs off of the bed and opens the bottom drawer of their bedside table.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Within moments, Rio pulls the harness up her hips and secures the dildo in the o-ring. Then, she encloses her cut, bleeding hand around the strap and pumps it up and down, coating it in her blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio drags her gaze from the strap to her wife— the way she can see Agatha's ragged breaths with the way her chest is heaving. She then climbs back on top of Agatha, who's stretched her arms up above her head and spread her legs in preparation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her thighs have mostly stopped bleeding now, just the occasional droplet of blood forming over the cuts before steadily sliding down her leg, futher staining the bedsheets.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hands settle at Agatha's jawline, dropping a kiss to her lips and nose, then tracing the dried bloody handprint on her face. The head of the strap is nudging just slightly against Agatha's clit, teasing her and drawing desperate whines from the back of her throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, please," Her head sinks further into the duvet as she arches her back into Rio's stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio continues to tease her for a few moments, sucking and biting marks into the flesh of Agatha's neck. She lasts for maybe three minutes, before sliding a hand down to the bloody strap and slowly guiding it inside of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The wet sound of it entering her fills both their ears, drawing a desperate little gasp from Agatha and a groan from Rio. And when Rio bottoms out, she doesn't move immediately. She just rolls her hips into Agatha's, pressing and rubbing the strap against the sweet spot inside of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In her impatience, Agatha wraps her legs around Rio's waist, hooking them at the ankles. She tries to encourage Rio to move <em>properly—</em> to actually <em>fuck her</em>, but the look on Rio's face is telling her she'll have to do much more than that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, she bats her eyelashes and gives Rio her most desperate look when she begs, "Ri, please, sweetheart, <em>please</em> fuck me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls out a couple inches before slowly sliding back in, simultaneous to dipping her head to drag her tongue over Agatha's collarbones.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Rio</em>, I need you to— <em>please</em>, I want you to— to come inside me." A couple chokes moans break her sentence as Rio sucks a few deep red marks into her skin. "Use me. Please. <em>Please</em> fuck me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs lightly, "Good girl. You always know what I want to hear, don't you?" But she doesn't move— not yet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, are you gonna fuck me, or are you gonna keep talking—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without warning, Rio pulls out almost all the way and snaps her hips forward, a sharp slap of their hips filling the room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, <em>fuck</em>, yeah, like that, <em>please</em>," Agatha moans, tightly wrapping her arms around Rio's neck and pulling her closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They aren't quite kissing— their mouths are open against eachother's, gasping and sighing and moaning with each thrust Rio gives. She stays at a steady pace, not too fast and not too slow, <em>just right</em>, just what they both need.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, Agatha, you're so— so fucking beautiful," Rio murmurs, her eyes half-lidded as she looks down at her wife— her wife taking her like it's all she ever wants to do.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—" Agatha cuts herself off with a soft sound mixed between a sob and a moan at a particularly hard thrust, "I missed this. Missed <em>you,"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio knows what she means. "I know, mi amor. You have me." She lays a hand over the <em>R</em> scar on her chest, and in return, Agatha places a hand over Rio's <em>A.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You feel so good," Agatha shudders, her hands wrapping back around Rio's neck and playing with the baby hairs that rest at the nape.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio moans and adjusts the pumping of her hips slightly so that the base of the strap can press more firmly against her own clit, to pull herself closer to climax. Just barely, she can feel Agatha tense beneath her, and can feel that she's clenching around the strap with each thrust.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, just to push her over the edge, Rio glides a hand down and rubs quick, tight circles over Agatha's clit. And, just as she suspected, Agatha unravels and her orgasm rushes through her body, her legs shaking and attempting to close, but unable with Rio between them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio starts to slow her thrusts, but Agatha places a hand on her lower back and guides her to carry on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No," Agatha breathes, "keep going, I want— I want you to come like this, <em>please</em>, Rio,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It doesn't take Rio long after that. Not with Agatha whispering little praises in her ear and grazing her nails up and down Rio's back. When Rio comes, she does so with a cry and her hips slow to a stop as she buries her head in the crook of Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just strokes through Rio's hair, while Rio lands wet kisses across her wife's neck. The kisses start more or less innocent, until theh become more deliberate, more tongue and teeth, and they start to lower.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha chuckles, tugging at her hair a little, "are you not done with me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Only if you want me to be." Rio husks against her skin, dotting a few more kisses over her breasts, finishing with a quick, teasing suck to her nipple.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Fuck</em>," Agatha sighs contently, her back arching involuntarily into Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because, I, for one, would <em>love</em> to taste you. It's been far too long."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, I love you." Agatha groans, then pushes Rio's head down to guide her between her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Te amo." Rio replies softly, then kisses Agatha's inner thigh— the one which isn't riddled with cuts and blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before Rio can shift her head to touch her properly, Agatha tugs at her hair a little to get her full attention when she says, "Be gentle, please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, mi amor." Rio nods, then softly, <em>so</em> softly, almost <em>too</em> softly, glides her tongue over Agatha's slit, flicking lightly against her clit and drawing a moan from her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, Rio, you— fuck," She sighs, starting to get lost in the haze of yet another building orgasm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks against her, before slowly sliding her tongue between Agatha's folds and dipling her tonge inside her. She whimpers as she catches the taste of her own blood combined with <em>Agatha's</em> taste, and thrusts her tongue deeper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At this angle, her nose presses into Agatha's clit, whose hips have begun to move of their own accord, grinding into Rio's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio slides her tongue out just to mumble, "You taste so fucking good," Before drawing soft circles around Agatha's clit, hitting just the right spots.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whines above her, the sound slowly dropping into a quiet hum, her hands tightening in Rio's hair. The muscles in her thighs tighten a little, instinctively trying to close around Rio's head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sensitive, aren't you?" Rio teases, the heat of her breath fanning over Agatha's centre.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Obviously. You fucked the living daylights out of me, remember?" She huffs, but the tremble in her voice betrays her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How could I forget when you sounded so gorgeous?" She says, then dips her head down again and continues to work Agatha toward her climax.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, baby, a— a little harder, please," She breathes, tangling her fingers in Rio's hair and tugging her closer against her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't deny her that. She lays her tongue flat and grinds it against Agatha's clit a few times feeling and listening as her wife comes undone almost immediately at the added pressure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After this, Rio relents. She climbs back up Agatha's body and presses her own flush to her wife's. Rio hums into her, relaxing to the sound of her heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Remind me why we stopped killing people?" Agatha breathes, wrapping her arms around Rio's waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't remember. Doesn't matter anymore." Rio's words are muffled against Agatha's skin, who huffs a laugh in response.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Let me clean you up, honey." She says, shifting Rio to the side of her and moving to sit up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fine." Rio grumbles, laying limp on the mattress.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha returns, she has a glass of water and their cute, little first aid kit. Said cute, little first aid kit used to be in their room for situations like these, but when they stopped, they decided to move it out of their room too. After suggesting it, Rio had said it served as a reminder and made the urges worse.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits down on the bed beside Rio and pulls her to sit up, which she does so begrudgingly. Carefully, Agatha opens up Rio's palm and grabs an antiseptic wipe, cleaning around the shallow wounds and wiping the blood away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This is probably going to be a bitch to heal, my love." She warns her as she grabs the roll of bandages from the kit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Worth it. I swear, I've never heard you make some of the noises you made when you had the knife in you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clears her throat, "Well, I— it—" She stammers a little, "whatever."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, though it morphs into a pained hitch of breath and whimper. Her arm tenses a little, resisting the reflex to pull away. But Agatha's touch is gentle, and the other part of her leans into it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once finished with her wife's hand, Agatha grabs another wipe and cleans the rest of the blood off of her. She takes her time, not wanting to irritate the skin too much.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets Rio clean her up, too. She's slow and careful with the cut on her lower stomach, and even slower and more careful with the cuts on her inner thigh. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is also what Agatha missed. Not just the murder, the sex. She missed the care that they laid on eachother afterwards. The small gestures of cleaning the blood off of them, or tending to their wounds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the time they're finished, it's gone eleven o'clock. They simply lay back down in bed— the newly bloodstained bed, and hold eachother. For one of the first times in months, they aren't scared to fall asleep. They needed this. Desperately.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just before Agatha drifts off, she hears Rio sigh, probably louder than she had intended to let out. Agatha places a hand on her cheek, urging her to meet her gaze.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is it?" She asks, frowning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But Rio doesn't need to tell her for her to know. It's unspoken.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs. "We're going to be okay, darling."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What if—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha gently cuts her off, "we're going to be okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio puffs some air out of her cheeks, almost physically restraining herself from speaking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My love, I promise. We're okay. And most of all, we can <em>sleep</em>, without worrying about nightmares."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You don't know that the nightmares'll stop." Rio counters.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head. "Not for sure, no. But they might. Have you still got the urge?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio then shakes her own head. "No."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"See? It's not... taking over the rest of our thoughts. We'll be okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." She nods and curls into Agatha more, a silent request to end the conversation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha obliges, threading a hand into her hair. "Get some well earned sleep, my love."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You too. I love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you, too, sweetheart."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And they fall asleep in eachother's arms, content with eachother— content sleeping beside a murderer. But they both trust that murderer. They're both happy. So, if that's what their life has come to, then so be it.</p>
