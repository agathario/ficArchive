     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Agatha Harkness is the CEO of a massive bookstore chain, and Rio Vidal is the owner of a small book shop she’s driving out of business. In person, they cannot stand each other—but online? They’re unknowingly connecting as TheGreenWitch and DTWR.
     </p>
<p>
      Then Agatha discovers Rio’s true identity, and realizes she’s falling for the person who hates her most.

<div>
<p>
     Central Park in the fall was practically showing off. The trees were dressed in every shade of red and gold, and the air smelled crisp. Couples strolled hand in hand, tourists paused for selfies, and somewhere, a saxophonist played a soulful tune that sounded almost too cinematic to be real.
    </p>
<p>
     But it wasn’t —it was simply Manhattan. Across the park, the West Side hummed with its own rhythm: Broadway was busy as always, its sidewalks lined with people darting between boutique gyms, shiny stores with even shinier price tags, and movie theaters advertising the latest superhero sequel no one had asked for. Delivery bikes zipped by in tight packs, dodging pedestrians with precision.
    </p>
<p>
     A few streets further, the noise dulled to a buzz. Through one of the brownstone’s windows, the morning light spilled lazily, illuminating the cozy world of the thirty-eight year old Rio Vidal.
    </p>
<p>
     She was still curled up in bed, her dark hair fanned out across the pillow, one hand flung dramatically over her eyes as if warding off the inevitable pull of the day.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't a morning person.
    </p>
<p>
     Her bedroom was an explosion of comfort and character: a queen-sized bed, a desk cluttered with notes and a computer, and bookshelves that seemed to groan under the weight of their contents.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio finally stirred, it was with an exaggerated stretch.
    </p>
<p>
     She got up and padded to the bathroom in her pajamas—an ancient, oversized T-shirt that might have once belonged to an ex.
    </p>
<p>
     The living room greeted her. In the corner, her trusty espresso machine waited like a soldier at its post.
    </p>
<p>
     Cup in hand, she tiptoed to her laptop, her movements almost giddy. This was her secret morning ritual.
    </p>
<p>
     She opened the lid, fingers hovering over the keyboard, anticipation lighting her face.
    </p>
<p>
     The screen blinked to life.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You've got mail."
     </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A smile tugged at her lips. The familiar chime never failed to delight her, even if most of her inbox was cluttered with promises of miracle wealth and dubious self-improvement schemes. With the efficiency of a woman on a mission, Rio deleted the junk—
     <em>
      “Big Cash Op,” “Oil Mkt,”
     </em>
     and a particularly enthusiastic
     <em>
      “THIS REALLY WORKS!”
     </em>
     —until only one email remained.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "DTWR: Señor Scratchy."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She clicked it, settling back as she began to read.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Señor Scratchy is my rabbit. I can’t believe I never told you about him. He loves the streets of New York as much as I do, but I can't let him enjoy it aside from through the window ....”
     </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
     On the other side of town, Agatha Harkness was pouring herself a cup of tea, wearing a silk robe trailing. Her long, brown hair fell in waves over her shoulders, and her kitchen—minimal but chic—was bathed in the soft light of mid-morning.
    </p>
<p>
     At her feet, lounging on a purple pillow embroidered with his name, was Señor Scratchy, her rabbit and self-proclaimed ruler of the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled as she glanced at him, setting her mug down on the counter. She sat at her table, laptop open, the gentle hum of the city in the background. As her fingers danced over the keyboard, she thought of her unlikely pen pal, her Green Witch, and smiled.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Don’t you love New York in the fall? It makes me want to buy school supplies. I’d send you a bouquet of newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your name and address,”
     </em>
     she typed.
     <em>
      “On the other hand, this not knowing has its charms."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The unmistakable sound of tiny feet pounding down the hall shattered the quiet.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha barely had time to lift her mug before her eight-year-old son, Nicky, burst into the kitchen, his dark hair bouncing with the kind of energy reserved for children.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom,” he declared, his tone serious, “we need to talk about breakfast.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised a perfectly arched brow. “Good morning to you, too, Nicholas.”
    </p>
<p>
     She gestured toward Señor Scratchy, still splayed on his pillow. “Perhaps you’d like to take a page from his book and try lounging for once?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky crossed his arms, unconvinced. “Scratchy doesn’t have homework. Or a science fair project. Or a mom who forgets to buy cereal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a dramatic gasp, clutching her robe as if he’d wounded her. “I bought cereal last week. That organic, non-GMO, prebiotic thing you begged me to try.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And it tasted like cardboard,” Nicky shot back, unimpressed. “We had to feed it to Scratchy, remember? He didn’t even like it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced at the rabbit, who flicked an ear as if in agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” she relented, leaning back in her chair. “What’s your brilliant solution?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was thinking pancakes,” Nicky said, climbing onto a chair across from her. “But only if you don’t try to sneak in chia seeds this time. I’m wise to your tricks, Mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. Nicky had inherited her wit, her sharp mind, and, much to her occasional annoyance, her stubborn streak. He was the kind of kid who could charm his way into—or out of—almost anything.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pancakes it is,” she said, standing up and stretching like she was preparing for a marathon. “But don’t get used to this. I have emails to answer, a rabbit to placate, and a life, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right, your ‘pen pal,’” Nicky teased, smirking. “Are you sure this isn’t just a
     <em>
      catfish
     </em>
     situation? Or, uh, I guess a
     <em>
      rabbitfish
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze mid-step, turning to give him a look of mock outrage. “Who taught you what a catfish is?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The internet,” he said casually, then added with a shrug, “and probably you. You teach me everything, Mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was moments like these that made Agatha’s exasperation dissolve into something warmer. She leaned down and kissed the top of his head, even as he squirmed and protested.
    </p>
<p>
     “Keep it up, wise guy, and you’re making the pancakes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky grinned. “I’ll grab the whisk.”

<p>
     The corner of 83rd Street greeted Rio with the soft chaos of the West Side waking up: parents ushering kids toward school—some by hand, others from behind the tinted windows of SUVs (some even in SUV’s by personal drivers, as was the case for Nicky)—dogs pulling on leashes, and delivery trucks parked with hazard lights blinking.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio paused at the newsstand on her route. The vendor greeted her with a nod, and she returned it with a soft smile, reaching for
     <em>
      The New York Times
     </em>
     . Her fingers lingered briefly on the cover as she scanned the headlines before tucking it under her arm and continuing her walk downtown.
    </p>
<p>
     Behind her, a block or so away, Agatha moved with her usual blend of purpose and flair.
    </p>
<p>
     She wore sunglasses big enough to suggest she might have been a celebrity—if not for the fact that she was juggling a pile of newspapers. She scooped up the
     <em>
      Times
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      The Wall Street Journal
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      The Post
     </em>
     , and
     <em>
      The Daily News
     </em>
     with the efficiency of someone who thrived on knowing everything.
    </p>
<p>
     The West Side unfolded before them as they both made their way down Broadway, unaware of each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stopped to buy a black coffee at her usual spot. Across the street, Agatha lingered just long enough to pick up a bouquet of flowers—a mix of roses and eucalyptus—before vanishing into a side entrance of a building wrapped in plywood and scaffolding.
    </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, Rio turned onto Columbus Avenue, coffee in one hand, her paper in the other. The city moved around her in its noisy, unpredictable symphony: cabs honking, construction hammering, and the distant chatter of pedestrians.
    </p>
<p>
     When she reached the corner of 73rd Street, she stopped in front of her store.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      The Shop Around the Corner
     </em>
     was exactly the kind of place that could make someone stop and smile. Twinkle lights framed the large glass windows, which were filled with displays of stuffed animals posed with books as if they’d been caught mid-read. A plush bunny was nose-deep in
     <em>
      Goodnight Moon
     </em>
     , a lion flipped through
     <em>
      Where the Wild Things Are
     </em>
     , and a teddy bear, wearing a charming pinafore, sat proudly with
     <em>
      The Stupids Step Out
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Despite her slightly mysterious demeanor, this delightful bookstore was all Rio’s doing. She loved it as much as she pretended not to.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, Alice,” Rio called to the young woman waiting by the door, hands shoved into her pockets. Alice worked part-time at the store.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good morning” Alice replied, unsure, perpetually confused by Rio’s moods. She glanced up at the sky, which was crisp and clear, then back at Rio, as if searching for confirmation that this was, indeed, a beautiful day.
    </p>
<p>
     With a horrible metallic screech, Rio cranked up the grate over the storefront. The noise was loud enough to compete with the two cabs that nearly collided in front of the store, their drivers immediately launching into a shouting match that only New Yorkers could deliver with such poetic profanity.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced at the chaos with a shrug. “Don’t you just love New York in the fall?” she grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     She flipped the sign on the door from
     <em>
      CLOSED
     </em>
     to
     <em>
      OPEN
     </em>
     , booted up the system, and sipped her coffee with the satisfaction of someone settling into their favorite routine.
    </p>
<p>
     Inside
     <em>
      The Shop Around the Corner
     </em>
     , the atmosphere was as warm and inviting as ever. The wooden shelves, lovingly scuffed with use, stretched from floor to ceiling, filled with books that beckoned readers of all ages. A cozy reading nook for kids, complete with beanbags and tiny chairs, nestled in one corner. Posters of classic children’s book covers hung on the walls, lending a playful touch, while a glass case near the counter displayed treasures: first editions of
     <em>
      The Wizard of Oz
     </em>
     series and
     <em>
      Alice in Wonderland.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The highlight of the store was Rio’s pride and joy: a whimsical witch-themed display framed with pumpkin-shaped twinkle lights. A sign reading
     <em>
      “The Ten Best Witch List”
     </em>
     floated above an artful arrangement of books:
     <em>
      The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      The Wizard of Oz,
     </em>
<em>
      The Witches
     </em>
     , and of course,
     <em>
      The Legend of the Christmas Witch.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The counter held a glass jar brimming with green apple and blackberry lollipops, a siren call to children and adults alike.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hung up her black coat in the back, her hand pausing mid-motion as a dreamy smile played on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, what’s going on with you?” Alice’s voice snapped her out of her thoughts. She leaned against a bookshelf, arms crossed and an eyebrow raised.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing,” Rio said, far too quickly to be convincing.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice smirked. “You’re in love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s head whipped around. “In love? No. That’s crazy. Do you think you could get the Christmas mailers out this week?”
    </p>
<p>
     “By Monday, I promise,” Alice said breezily. “But I have a paper due Friday. Now spill. What’s going on?” She narrowed her eyes, tilting her head in a way that made it clear she wasn’t moving until she had answers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed, rubbing her temples. “Ugh, fine. Remember the woman I told you about? The one I’ve been emailing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s face lit up with mischief. “Have you had sex?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No!” Rio spluttered. “I don’t even know her!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean Zoom sex, or phone sex,” Alice said, unbothered.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Alice, what the fuck.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shrugged like it was no big deal. “Well, don’t do it. The minute you do, they lose all respect for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned, running a hand through her hair. “It’s not like that. We just... email. It’s nothing. And I’ve been thinking about stopping because it’s getting—”
    </p>
<p>
     “Out of hand?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Confusing,” Rio admitted. “But also not really. Because it’s
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice gave her a knowing look. “Where’d you even meet her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hesitated, then smiled faintly. “The day I turned thirty-five, I wandered into one of those Over Thirty chat rooms for a laugh. She was there, and we started talking.”
    </p>
<p>
     “About what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Books. Music. How much we both love New York.” Her voice softened, and a small smirk crept across her lips. “Bouquets of sharpened pencils.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice blinked. “Excuse me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Forget it.” Rio waved it off quickly. “We don’t talk about anything personal. That’s the rule. I don’t know her name, what she does, or exactly where she lives. So it’s easy to stop seeing her, because... I’m not, technically.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. “She could literally be the next person to walk through the door.” She glanced toward the entrance. “She could be...” She paused dramatically as the bell above the door jingled. “...Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer Kale strode into the shop with her usual confidence. In her thirties, Jen had a sharp tongue, a kind heart, and a wardrobe that made her look like she’d stepped out of a trendy catalog.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning,” Jen said, setting her bag down behind the counter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you ever had an online relationship, Jen?” Alice asked, skipping pleasantries entirely.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen gave her a flat look. “Hello to you, too. And no. The internet is just another way to get rejected by women.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before anyone could respond, Lilia bustled in. At seventy-two, Lilia had an air of delightful chaos about her, from her salt-and-pepper curls to the jangling bracelets that never seemed to stay in place. She had been part of the shop longer than anyone and could outsmart them all without breaking a sweat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good morning, Lilia,” Rio said warmly.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are we talking about?” Lilia asked, dropping her bag on the counter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Phone sex,” Alice deadpanned.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia didn’t miss a beat. “I tried that once, but I kept muting myself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen laughed, and even Rio cracked a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     The bell jingled again, and this time, two West Side moms entered, each pushing a stroller.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to greet the kids. “Jess and Maia, how are you today?”
    </p>
<p>
     Before they could answer, the rumble of a garbage truck outside caught Rio’s attention. She excused herself and stepped out the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Rio called out, arms crossed as she watched the two garbage men hoist trash bags into the truck. “You forgot to pick up the garbage last week, and I got a ticket. Now you’re late today, and I could’ve gotten another.”
    </p>
<p>
     The first garbage man looked up, clearly unimpressed. “We were here. There wasn’t any garbage.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” the second one echoed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave them both a pointed look, clicking her tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you think?” the first man continued, exasperated. “I don’t want to pick up garbage? You think I go up and down the street picking up garbage and just skip yours for fun?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, her stance unwavering.
    </p>
<p>
     The second man nudged his partner, muttering something under his breath. They hurriedly finished the job, throwing the last bag into the truck as Rio watched, satisfied.
    </p>
<p>
     Back inside, the shop hummed with life again, the comforting chaos of books, laughter, and the city moving just as it always did.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A few blocks away was a large construction site. The rhythmic chime of bells echoes through the street as a small knife-sharpener truck trundles past the site, its cheerful jingle standing in sharp contrast to the chaos inside.
    </p>
<p>
     The site was a whirlwind of activity. Electricians balanced on ladders, their tools clinking as they worked on tangled bundles of wire. Masons hollered instructions as they mixed mortar, and a faint hum of machinery underpinned it all.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s assistant, Billy, clipboard in hand and looking perpetually stressed, ducked around a pile of drywall to meet Agatha. She stood at the center of the site, sharp-eyed and poised. Still dressed impeccably, of course.
    </p>
<p>
     “The electrical contractor called,” Billy began, barely taking a breath. “His truck hit a deer last night, so he’s out until tomorrow. The shelves are delayed because the shipment of pine had beetles. And there’s, uh, some debate about whether the stairs are going in the right spot—”
    </p>
<p>
     “That sounds fantastic,” Agatha interrupted breezily, her tone as dry as the dust in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy frowned, his train of thought thrown. “Testing one, two, three, four.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tilted her head. “Is the electrician here?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy blinked. “I just told you—his truck hit a deer!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t seem to register his exasperation. Instead, she looked up at the exposed beams. “I hear nothing. Not a sound from the city streets. Just the beat of my own heart.” She paused, her gaze distant. “I think that’s how it goes... Something like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy’s face shifted, suspicion dawning. “Have you met someone?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot him a sharp look. “What do you mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     He smirked. “Well, I’m getting a certain vibe from you—”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t give vibes,” she snapped, immediately pivoting to business. “Are we still on schedule?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy let it go, falling back into his comfort zone of logistics. “We’re set to open two weeks before Thanksgiving.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then we should announce ourselves soon,” Agatha said, her voice firm. “Let people know we’re coming.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy chuckled. “This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The minute they hear, they’ll be lining up to picket the big bad chain store—”
    </p>
<p>
     “—that destroys everything we hold dear,” Agatha finished. Her lips quirked into a wry smile as she leaned toward Billy.
    </p>
<p>
     “But we’ll seduce them, won’t we? With our square footage, our deep armchairs, our lightning-fast checkout lines, our unbeatable discounts, and our...”
    </p>
<p>
     “...oat cappuccinos.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha folded her arms, satisfied. “They’ll hate us in the beginning, but we’ll win them over in the end.”
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The sleek, corporate office hummed with quiet efficiency. The PurpleBooks logo, modern and imposing, dominated the wall behind Agatha and her colleague Herb in her glass-walled office.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am a little concerned about the neighborhood response,” Agatha began.
    </p>
<p>
     Herb leaned back in his chair with a smirk. “I have some
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     sad news,” he said, feigning gravity. “City Books on 23rd Street is going under.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Another independent bookstore bites the dust,” Agatha said, her tone casual as she made a note on her tablet.
    </p>
<p>
     “On to the next,” Herb replied with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I’m buying their entire inventory,” Agatha added, not missing a beat. “Architecture, New York history—it’ll make a perfect addition to the new store.”
    </p>
<p>
     Herb raised an eyebrow. “How much are we paying for that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever it costs,” she said, waving off his concern. “We’re also adding a section on West Side writers to appease the locals.”
    </p>
<p>
     Herb gave her an approving nod. “Perfect. That’ll keep those West Side liberal nutjob pseudo-intellectual bleeding hearts—”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re called
     <em>
      readers
     </em>
     ,” Agatha corrected, her tone as icy as the glare she shot him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right,” Herb said, unbothered. “Readers.”
    </p>
<p>
     He shifted gears. “What’s the competition like?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tapped her pen thoughtfully. “There’s one mystery store—Sleuth, on 86th and Amsterdam. And a children’s bookstore. The Shop Around the Corner. I always went there as a kid... It's been there forever.”
    </p>
<p>
     Herb smirked, leaning forward. “Not for long.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t respond, but a flicker of
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     crossed her face. She quickly pushed the uncomfortable feeling down.

      Rio looked up from her phone as something caught her eye—a butterfly. In the gritty subway car, it seemed impossibly out of place, its delicate wings a stark contrast to the metal and grime. She watched as it flitted past indifferent commuters, the corners of her mouth tugging into a smile. She began typing on her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Once I read a story about a butterfly in the subway, and today I saw one. I couldn’t believe it. It got on at 42nd—”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The subway slowed, screeching to a stop. The butterfly hovered near the door before gliding out into the open air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “—and got off at 59th, where I assumed it was going to Bloomingdale’s to buy a hat.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She tucked her phone away, grinning.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      On the corner by H&amp;H Bagels, the flour truck rumbled to life, its engines loud enough to break the quiet of the early morning. The chute stretched from the truck, pouring a steady stream of fine white powder into the ground, like some strange ritual. The air filled with a soft, yeasty haze. Agatha paused as she rounded the corner, breathing deeply. The scent of baking bread surrounded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She drafted in her notes:
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “Did you know that every night a truck pulls up to H&amp;H Bagels and pumps about a ton of flour into the ground? The air is absolutely amazing.”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha thought of The Green Witch, or
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       her
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , as she called her in her head, and her favorite book.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “I guess I've read The Secret History about 100 times --”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha remembered that statement more clearly than she liked to admit. She had never liked
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Secret History
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      —the pacing was all wrong, and the characters... they grated on her. But she didn’t want to say that, not to her, not to someone who clearly cherished it. Instead, she tried again. Every so often, she'd pick it up, hoping that maybe this time, it would be different.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood in line in the coffeeshop, listening as customers rattled off their orders. “Short decaf cap.” “Tall matcha latte.” “Grande low-fat regular.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Rio walked past the site again, the painter had made progress. The sign now read: “COMING SOON: A PurpleBooks SUPERSTORE.” She didn’t notice it, her thoughts elsewhere.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But, later that day, Jen did. She saw the sign as she strolled along Broadway, her gaze lingering on the bold, imposing letters.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At
      <em>
       The Shop Around The Corner
      </em>
      , Rio greeted customers while Jen slipped to the back to hang up her coat. Lilia, ever warm, nodded at her from the desk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s up?” Rio asked, poking her head into the back room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled. “I saw a cute woman just now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed. Jen’s updates were as regular as clockwork. “Who was she?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know. She just crossed my path.” Jen hesitated. “Do you believe in love at first sight?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I completely believe in it,” Rio said without missing a beat. “It happened to Madame Bovary, at least six times.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia chimed in from the desk, her tone cutting but playful. “And she was wrong every time!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio waved her off, grinning. “Whatever. You fell in love. That’s so great.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen chuckled, shaking her head. “Oh. One other thing.”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Later, the three of them stood together on Columbus Avenue, staring at the now-complete sign. It read: “COMING SOON: A PurpleBooks SUPERSTORE.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia broke the silence first. “Quel nightmare.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio folded her arms, her tone firm. “It has nothing to do with us. It’s big, impersonal, overstocked, and full of ignorant salespeople.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They discount,” Jen pointed out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shot her a look. “They don’t provide any service. We do.”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Drip, a cozy café on Amsterdam Avenue, buzzed with quiet energy. Fifties-style couches and mismatched chairs created snug seating arrangements. It was a spot Alice often went to study. Rio stood at the counter, her posture easy yet professional, waiting for their drinks with Alice beside her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I went to the PurpleBooks website,” Alice said, scrolling on her phone. “You can buy anything. They ship it to you in a day. Maybe we should get a website.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hell no.” Rio’s voice was calm, but her decision was firm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice sighed as they carried their drinks toward the back of the café. Rio’s gaze caught on a table stacked with loose-leaf binders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What if they put us out of business?” Alice asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow. “It’s out of the question. We’re a fixture in the neighborhood. Practically a landmark.” She tried to ignore the feeling of dread in her stomach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She gestured to the binders. “What’s this?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice grinned slyly. “Men for Women, Women for Women, Whoever for Whoever. You fill out one of these forms, and they file it in a book. If someone’s interested, they set up a meeting.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio flipped through the pages, a smirk tugging at her lips. “What a stupid way to meet someone.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Compared to the internet?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s just a lark.” Rio shrugged dismissively.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice gave her a knowing look. “So it’s still going on?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It doesn’t mean anything. I don’t plan to meet her.” Rio tapped the binder with her finger. “Why do I get the feeling you’re in here somewhere?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With mock drama, Alice flipped the book open to her own application.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I came in one night, drank too much coffee, and filled one out,” she admitted. “How else am I supposed to meet someone? I need to know what they’re like. I could never fall in love with a republican.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed softly. “Fair enough. I could never, under any circumstances, love anyone who had a sailboat.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Neither could I.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If I had to get up on a Saturday morning, knowing I was about to go down to the pier and unravel all those ropes and put on all that sunblock—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “All that talk about the wind,” Alice added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And then you actually go sailing,” Rio continued, “and sail and sail until you’re bored witless. Just when you think it’s over, they say, ‘Let’s turn around,’ and you realize the trip is only half over. Except it’s not, because the wind has changed—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It hasn’t changed,” Alice said with mock despair. “It’s died.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled. “And then there’s more talk about the wind while you bob up and down trying not to get sick.”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      A bit further away, that same day, Agatha leapt from her sailboat onto the dock, landing with a grace that spoke of years of practice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The crisp breeze tousled her hair, but she barely noticed. The rhythmic slap of waves against the hull was as familiar as the beating of her own heart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom!” Nicky called from the pier, where he stood with his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket. He rocked back on his heels, his expression expectant and full of mischief.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha strode toward him briskly, her strides confident and unhurried. “Hiya, my boy.” Her voice was warm but clipped. “What is it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky tilted his head, as if pondering. “Nothing much.” His grin widened, and a spark of mischief lit his dark eyes. “What should we do next?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha arched an eyebrow, folding her arms. “Nothing much? You’re always up to something, Nicky. Spit it out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He shrugged, the picture of innocence, though his grin betrayed him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, maybe we could go to that donut place on 85th. Or—” His eyes twinkled with sudden inspiration. “Maybe you could let me steer the boat!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Steer the boat?” Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, shaking her head. “Last time I let you steer, we nearly capsized. And don’t pretend you didn’t love it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t love it,” Nicky said, trying to be serious but breaking into laughter. “But it was kind of cool.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She crouched slightly, leveling him with a playful smirk. “Tell you what, sailor. If you can help me secure the rigging, maybe I’ll think about it next time. But for now…” She tapped her chin theatrically. “What about something more on land?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alright,” she said dryly, ruffling his hair, which he immediately tried to fix. “Come on, then. Let’s go see what kind of trouble we can get into.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She slung her bag over her shoulder and started walking up the dock, her posture straight and purposeful. Nicky trailed behind for a moment, then skipped to her side, matching her stride with exaggerated effort.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they made their way off the pier, Nicky piped up again. “Do you think they still have those giant pretzels at the fair?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Probably. Though I’m not buying you one and a donut.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why not?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chuckled, her smile softening. “You’ll thank me later.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “For what?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “For saving your stomach.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky laughed, racing ahead a few steps and then turning to walk backward, facing her. “Fine, maybe I can steer next time?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shook her head, laughing despite herself. “We’ll see, sailor. We’ll see.”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      As they entered the block, the street fair buzzed around them—food stands, kids running past, the smell of caramelized sugar and grilling sausages filling the air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Nicky strolled past the chaos, but her steps faltered as they neared a
      <em>
       The Shop Around the Corner
      </em>
      . For a moment, she hesitated, a flicker of guilt passing through her. But just as quickly as it came, it was gone. She didn’t need to think about it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Outside, a sign hung, glowing with twinkle lights.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Storybook Lady Today, 3:30
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . The moment her eyes landed on it, she knew it was a mistake to come here, but Nicky was already pulling at her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky tugged her hand, his eyes bright. “Mom! Can we?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Inside, a woman sat on a stool, reading aloud to a group of children. Her voice was low, animated, and effortlessly captivating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could see how the kids were entranced, their wide eyes focused entirely on her, as if they didn’t want to miss a single word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was already moving toward the group, eager to join them, his feet quick and sure. But Agatha stayed at the back, lingering near the shelves.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her gaze lingered on the woman—her easy confidence, the warmth in her voice. Her dark eyes. Something shifted in Agatha’s chest, subtle but undeniable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She noticed that a dark lock of hair fell from behind her ear as she bent down to adjust the book in her lap. Agatha's fingertips itched.

      After finishing her reading session, Rio knelt beside a dark haired boy at a shelf of Betsy-Tacy books.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is her best friend, Tacy,” Rio explained, showing him a cover. “Her real name is Anastasia. And then in the next book, Betsy and Tacy become friends with Tib. Her real name—brace yourself—is Thelma.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nearby, Agatha was inspecting a first edition of Swiss Family Robinson. A woman, her name tag reading ‘Jen’ was explaining, her tone reverent.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The illustrations are hand-tipped, which is why—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It costs so much,” Agatha finished smoothly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled. “It’s why it’s
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       worth
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      so much.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha returned the smile, then glanced toward the other side of the store. The ‘Storybook Lady’ sat beside him.  She watched as her son pointed to a row of books.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I want to read all of them,” the boy declared, his voice full of determination. Rio couldn’t help the small smile tugging at her lips. She’d heard that line more times than she could count.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That might be a lot for your mom to buy,” Rio said gently, her voice warm but pragmatic. She wasn’t trying to discourage him, just grounding him a little in reality.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boy, however, was unshaken. He raised his chin in defiance. “My mom gets me all the books I want.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t help but chuckle under her breath, the kind of soft laugh that only a parent’s deep love could inspire. This kid had spirit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked up just in time to see the woman approaching. She’d noticed her earlier, lingering at the back of the shop, but had focused on the story in front of her. Still, her eyes kept pulling her back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Something about the woman’s presence—how she carried herself, and the air of quiet confidence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, that’s very nice of her,” Rio said, half to herself, as she let her attention drift over the woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Blue eyes flickered to her, sharp and interested. “What are you two talking about?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boy, without hesitation, answered, “You, of course.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio straightened slightly, amused by his bluntness. “Rio,” she said, offering a brief nod.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boy’s grin spread. “And this is Agatha,” he announced proudly, as though presenting royalty to a crowd. If Rio had to guess, she probably was royalty in his eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s lips quirked slightly, and Rio caught a brief flicker in her eyes. Rio’s smile deepened, not sure if she was reading too much into it, but she wasn’t ready to look away just yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hello, Agatha,” she said, her voice warmer now. It came more easily than she expected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She glanced back down at Nicky, catching him in the middle of another attempt to rush ahead. “And you are?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky beamed up at her, as proud as ever. “Oh, right! I’m Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s expression softened, her eyes scanning Rio for a second longer than necessary. There was something there—a quiet interest. Rio felt it, too, in the slight shift of Agatha’s posture. Something in the air felt different, even if it was just for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nice to meet you both,” Rio said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The moment hung there for a second—unspoken, between them—until Nicky sneezed suddenly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s reflexes were quick. She pulled a handkerchief from her sleeve with a flourish, the delicate fabric embroidered with her initials and a small spider.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky wrinkled his nose, eyeing it curiously. “What’s that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A handkerchief,” Rio said with mock seriousness. “It’s like a Kleenex, but you don’t throw it away. See? It’s embroidered with my initials. And a spider. Because they’re my favorite animal.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s a weird choice,” Nicky said, looking both puzzled and impressed. “But I like it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled, the sound light but genuine. She was used to being the one who made people laugh, but somehow it felt different this time. She glanced at Agatha, whose expression had shifted, that calculating look now tempered with something softer. She was studying her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Who are you?” Agatha asked, her voice steady, but Rio could hear the subtle curiosity laced in the words.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio Vidal. I own this store.” Rio didn’t rush the words, letting the title sit with its own meaning. “And you are?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha. Just Agatha,” she said quickly, almost too quickly, as though she was putting distance between them. But then, as if reconsidering, she added, “We’ll take these books.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled, and took the books to the counter. She started ringing them up, her fingers moving with practiced ease but without hurrying. “These are wonderful books,” she said to the mother and son, her tone softer now. “As Nicky gets older, the characters grow up, too. You can grow with them.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She met Agatha’s gaze again as she spoke, not missing the subtle way Agatha’s expression softened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's heart skipped a beat when Jen, standing next to Rio, spoke with that pointed, casual tone. “These are the kind of books PurpleBooks would probably never carry. They’re too niche, too meaningful. Not profitable enough.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen’s eyes flicked toward Agatha as she said it, her gaze lingering with that knowing little spark. Agatha’s chest tightened. Her stomach dropped, the panic creeping in before she could stop it. Not now. Not when the tension in the air was already thick.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky, bless him, picked the worst moment to chime in. “PurpleBooks! My mom—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before he could finish, Agatha’s hand shot out, covering his mouth with a little too much force, her fingers pressing over his lips as she bent down to meet his eyes. She smiled too brightly, probably a little too forcefully, but she had to nip this in the bud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Likes to shop with care,” she interrupted smoothly, hoping she sounded casual enough. She forced herself to keep smiling, though her insides were twisting into knots.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky blinked up at her, clearly confused by the change in tone but not questioning it, thankfully. Agatha’s smile faltered just for a split second as she straightened, catching Rio’s amused gaze from the corner of her eye.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Uh-huh,” Rio said, her voice light, but there was something else in it—something knowing. Her lips curved upward, and her eyes lingered on Agatha just a moment too long.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's words were cool, like they were being said just for her. “Well, for what it’s worth, the world isn’t driven by discounts. Not in the long run.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow, trying to play it off. “You’re sure about that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The corner of Rio’s mouth quirked up slightly, but there was something deeper in her eyes now, something... personal. “Positive. I’ve been in this business long enough to know.” She looked around the store with a quiet kind of pride, her hand brushing along the spines of the books, almost possessive. “This store—it’s been here for decades. Stores like PurpleBooks? They come and go. This…” Rio gestured around the room, her voice softening in a way that made Agatha feel like she was being pulled into something she wasn’t prepared for. “This lasts.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She swallowed hard, forcing her body to remain still, even as her thoughts raced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I see,” she managed to say, her voice quieter, almost too soft. She mentally shook herself, trying to pull it together. “I mean, yeah, I know. It’s a great business.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thanks,” Rio added with a small shrug, her grin returning: “So PurpleBooks can go to hell.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words landed, bold and unapologetic, hanging in the air with an unexpected charm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s quite the philosophy,” Agatha said with a wry smile, a nervous laugh escaping her. Thankfully, Nicky had already moved on to a new distraction, pretending not to listen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s grin widened, her stance casual but her eyes never leaving Agatha. “We’ll be back. Won’t we, Nicky?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yup!” Nicky called over his shoulder, already halfway toward the door. Agatha didn’t even have time to process that her son was running off, too distracted by Rio’s eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Goodbye, Rio,” Agatha said, her voice quieter this time, more thoughtful than she meant. She felt herself slipping into something she didn’t want to name.

     The Words We Choose
    </p>
<p>
     Dear Green Witch,
    </p>
<p>
     Do you ever wonder about the power of words? I do. More often than I should, probably. Words can change everything, don’t you think? They’re sharper than knives if you wield them correctly.
    </p>
<p>
     I have this habit—or maybe it’s a compulsion—of fixating on certain words. Turning them over in my mind like stones on a beach. Lately, my favorite is “threshold.” Say it aloud. Threshold. There’s something about it, like it’s bracing itself against the world. A threshold doesn’t care whether you’re stepping into a grand adventure or just a shabby little room. Either way, it demands something of you—a decision, a step forward, a choice.
    </p>
<p>
     What about you? Do you have a favorite word? Not necessarily the prettiest or the most complicated, but one you return to, like an old friend. Or maybe one you fear.
    </p>
<p>
     I can’t help but think about the words people use when they don’t know someone else is listening. Not the ones they use to impress, but the quiet, honest ones—the kind that slip out when they’re tired or vulnerable. That’s where the truth is, don’t you think?
    </p>
<p>
     Anyway, your turn. What’s your word?
    </p>
<p>
     Yours,
     <br/>
     DTWR
    </p>

     Re: The Words We Choose
    </p>
<p>
     Dear DTWR,
    </p>
<p>
     Threshold is a good choice. Strong. Full of meaning. It’s the kind of word that doesn’t waver or beg for attention—it just is. I like that. Since you’ve shared yours, let me offer one in return: verdant.
    </p>
<p>
     There’s something about it. It’s alive, vibrant even when the world feels barren. Verdant speaks of growth, but it’s not a pushy kind of growth—it’s quiet, natural, inevitable. Things are either verdant, or they’re not, but the word doesn’t judge.
    </p>
<p>
     I suppose that’s what I like about it. It reminds me that things can come back to life, even after a long frost.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s not that I ever use the word—I am not much of a speaker or user of big words. I keep communication simple, but written text is so much different. In that case, I love for it to be as complicated as it can be.
    </p>
<p>
     Speaking of words, you know I have to ask: what does
     <em>
      DTWR
     </em>
     stand for? It’s been tugging at my curiosity since your first letter. I know you don’t have to tell me, and maybe you won’t. It’s fine if you don’t want to step over that line yet. Thresholds, after all, are crossed when you’re ready, not before (smirk emoji… you know the one, right).
    </p>
<p>
     Still, if you ever decide to take that step… know that I’m here. Open to whatever.
    </p>
<p>
     Warmly,
     <br/>
     your witch

<p>
     Hi sweet witch,
    </p>
<p>
     You’re right. I won’t tell you. But I could ask the same of your name. Green Witch—what does that mean? It has always led me to imagine you as a gardener, or a botanist. Or is it something else entirely? I already know about your fondness for witches, which I love. But why the green? Is it a specific sort of witch? I imagine it’s a witch that aligns her powers with those of nature. But then I end up imagining you as a botanist again. Oh well.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, since we’re in the business of curiosity: do you believe in chance? Not the kind of chance that happens when you’re rolling dice, but the weird kind—the sort where something happens by sheer coincidence, and it feels like there’s no such thing as an accident. The kind that gets you thinking maybe, just maybe, we’re all nudged along a bit more than we realize.
    </p>
<p>
     I don’t trust things that feel too neat, you know? There’s something about these moments that seem like a fluke, but they keep adding up. People crossing paths, sudden decisions, the ones that change everything—
     <em>
      those
     </em>
     moments. Do you think it’s just luck? Or is there something else at play?
    </p>
<p>
     Let me know. I’m curious what you think. And don’t worry—I’m not expecting you to suddenly reveal your secret life as a herb-growing wizard. But you might give me something worth chewing on.
    </p>

     Dear DTWR,
    </p>
<p>
     I’m no gardener, but I do like the idea of tending to something and watching it grow. Maybe that’s where the name comes from. Maybe it’s something else. Like you said—sometimes mystery is more interesting. One day I might tell you!
    </p>
<p>
     Serendipity, though? I’m not sure. I’d like to think life isn’t all random, but if chance is in charge, it has a strange sense of humor. Take us, for example. Sometimes I laugh at myself. You are someone who knows all my secrets, even though you know so little about me. Sometimes I fear that you are completely someone else, or can't be trusted, but then I remember that you probably have the same fear. So who cares, haha. I am very thankful for you, I hope you know this.
    </p>
<p>
     But anyways- the power of chance. I wonder what led you to ponder this. I fear my answer differs per situation, and per person. I think I do believe in luck, though, as well as in misfortune. You know most things about my past, so, yeah.
    </p>

     No worries, I understand. Life has a way of handing out its share of misfortune, and I can’t help but think you’ve had way more than a fair share. But look at you now, still standing, still going.
    </p>
<p>
     Some people seem more destined for luck, or whatever, while others—well, others just have the will to keep going, no matter what. You learn how to create luck by yourself.
    </p>
<p>
     Isn’t life a laugh? Speaking of bitterness, haha.
    </p>
<p>
     You mentioned “tending to something.” This makes me wonder: what’s
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     haven? That place where you go to escape the mess? The world’s full of noise, but surely there’s some spot where you can hear yourself think.
    </p>
<p>
     Mine’s a boat. Small, nothing special—but it’s mine. I don’t know if I’ve mentioned it before. There’s something about being out on the water, just you and the horizon. It’s like the rest of the world is left behind on the shore. Not for everyone, but it gives me balance, or at least enough space to breathe for a bit.
    </p>
<p>
     You must have a place like that, don’t you? A spot where the world just... stops? Where everything else fades and you can just be?

     Dear DTWR,
    </p>
<p>
     Thank you so much for that warmth. Always very welcome :)
    </p>
<p>
     I like what you said about luck, I agree. And yeah, sometimes I just can’t help but feel jealous when people seem to have it easy. But most of the time, no one really does.
    </p>
<p>
     A boat? I have to admit, I find the idea unsettling. I have always hated boats, actually. Or maybe just the idea of it. There’s nowhere to go if the water turns against you. But I can understand the appeal of leaving the noise behind.
    </p>
<p>
     For me, it’s a place that is quiet, cozy, and full of stories. It’s not much, but it’s mine. My escape, and my responsibility.
    </p>
<p>
     Let me ask you something in return. If your haven is on the water, do you ever feel lost at sea? Or is it more about knowing the stars will guide you back?
    </p>

     Lost and Found
    </p>
<p>
     Dear Green,
    </p>
<p>
     Your “haven” sounds rather charming. You make it sound idyllic. What sort of place is it, if you don’t mind me asking? I can’t help but envy you for having something so grounded, so rooted.
    </p>
<p>
     As for being lost at sea... well, yes, sometimes. Growing up, I always felt like I was drifting, drowning, with no clear direction. But I have learned how to find my way. The stars do help. They are constant, unmoving—especially when everything else around you feels like it’s slipping through your fingers. They’ve always been there, guiding you.
    </p>
<p>
     Which brings me to a question I’ve been mulling over: Do you think it’s truly possible to know someone through words alone? Or do we just end up guessing, filling in the gaps where there’s silence? I wonder if we’re all just trying to figure each other out with the little pieces we get, or if there’s more to it than that. I’d like to believe I understand you fully. But then again, maybe that’s just me filling in the gaps.

<p>
     Dear Star lady,
    </p>
<p>
     Words are powerful, sure. But here’s the thing—words are also a cage. We dress up our thoughts in sentences, trying to make them neat and tidy, but there’s always something messy underneath. I think the real magic lies in the silence, the spaces between the words. It’s in the things we don’t say, the half-formed thoughts we keep tucked away. That’s where the truth lives, the good stuff—the things that make us who we are but are too risky to show.
    </p>
<p>
     I suppose that’s why I like this, you know? This back-and-forth with you. There’s something freeing about not knowing everything. Something about this anonymity—it’s like I get to be whoever I want to be for a moment. No judgments, no expectations. Just the words, floating between us like a quiet conversation that doesn’t have to make sense.
    </p>
<p>
     I want to know—what’s the last thing that made you laugh? Not the polite, half-assed chuckle that you give when you’re trying to be nice, but the real lauh. The kind that surprises you, catches you off guard. You know, the one that starts in your chest and just bursts out, even though you weren’t expecting it? That kind. What was it?
    </p>
<p>
     Honestly, I’m always on the lookout for things that make me laugh like that. Laughter has its own kind of magic, don’t you think?
    </p>
<p>
     Warmly (and very much waiting to hear your answer),

     Hi you,
    </p>
<p>
     Well, you’ve got me thinking at the thought of
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     last unexpected burst of joy. You seem like the type who holds things close, letting them simmer beneath the surface. Am I right?
    </p>
<p>
     As for me, I laughed just this morning. My son—I swear he gets more wit every day—insisted on wearing mismatched socks today. “They can be friends even if they’re not the same,” he said. I couldn't argue with that logic, really. He’s stubborn, but then, so am I. And yes, sometimes I think he’s starting to pick up on more than I give him credit for. Maybe he’s the wiser one in this relationship.
    </p>
<p>
     I wonder what you are thinking when reading this. I don’t often write about my son. I know we have our rules, but I am trying to make some baby steps towards opening up (even further) to you.
     <br/>
<br/>
     And yes, I like keeping that part of me tucked away. Maybe it’s because once I do, I’m not just the woman who writes cryptic notes under the guise of anonymity. I’m a mom. That is a whole lot less mysterious, all of the sudden. Let me know what you think, if moms do it for you or if I should stop talking, haha.
    </p>
<p>
     Or, I could tell you more about Señor Scratchy. Just as mysterious ;) I’ll leave that to you.
    </p>
<p>
     What made you smile today? Or was it just a passing moment that made your heart skip a beat?

      “Let me know what you think, if moms do it for you…”
     </em>
     the words echoed through Rio’s head.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Oh, if only she knew,
     </em>
     Rio thought, leaning back in her chair, staring blankly at the screen.
    </p>
<p>
     Because, yeah, moms did it for her. Always had.
    </p>
<p>
     And DTWR’s message was, as of now, the latest thing that made her smile.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio was younger, she used to find the moms of her friends endlessly fascinating. Not in any kind of conscious, articulate way, but there was something about them—their calm confidence. They were so put-together. So capable.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t understand it then, of course. Back then, it was just a vague admiration, an urge to linger in the kitchen while her friend ran off to grab snacks, chatting a little too long about nothing at all. Over the years, though, that vague admiration had sharpened into something else.
    </p>
<p>
     Now? Well, Rio’s “type” wasn’t something you could slap a label on—she wasn’t about to pull a cliché like
     <em>
      I only date older women.
     </em>
     But her weakness for moms? Still intact, undeniable as gravity.
    </p>
<p>
     And now Rio was wondering if DTWR was like Nicky's mom, Agatha. She groaned. She wasn’t even sure what it was about her. The way she carried herself, like she had nothing to prove but everything figured out?
    </p>
<p>
     The thought made her stomach twist uncomfortably. Was it possible to cheat on your online situationship?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a humorless laugh, leaning forward to grab her glass of wine.
     <em>
      Situationship.
     </em>
     That was a generous word for whatever she and DTWR were doing. They hadn’t even defined what they were to each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe it was time to be brave.
    </p>
<p>
     A text appeared on her phone screen. It was Lilia:
     <em>
      “Picking you up at seven for that event thing-y”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Her thoughts lingered.
    </p>
<p>
     Was she truly ready to take the next step? Would that mean that the eventual goal was to meet each other in real life?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had gone on plenty of dates with women from dating apps. Yet this, somehow, scared her. She couldn’t afford losing the woman.
    </p>
<p>
     The clock went from 5.59 to 6.00.
    </p>
<p>
     Right. She had to get ready for a literary event in some rich guy’s apartment.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The apartment hummed with that unique blend of intellectual energy and pretension—writers, journalists and other people swirling about like they were at the center of something bigger than it was. It was a room filled with people who all thought themselves the most interesting person in it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was not one of them.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood by the drinks table, swirling the wine in her glass as she surveyed the room, an easy half-smirk playing on her lips. Dressed in a black blazer over a white tee, sleeves rolled to the elbow. Beside her, Lilia was chatting with a small group of people.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go ahead, introduce me to someone interesting, Lilia. I’ll owe you,” Rio said, her tone teasing as she tipped her glass toward Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Lilia could reply, the star of the evening—a young, nervous writer—wandered past.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey. Congratulations, I’m Rio. This is Lilia,” Rio said smoothly, holding out her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     The writer blinked, startled, then smiled. “Thanks. Nice to meet you. How are you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “Oh, you know. Just here for the free wine and existential crises. You?”
    </p>
<p>
     As the writer laughed and Lilia rolled her eyes, Rio caught sight of someone across the room. Her easy smirk faltered for a fraction of a second, barely perceptible.
    </p>
<p>
     It was her—Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She was standing stiffly beside a tall man, holding a glass of bourbon. She looked… sharp. Way different from when Rio first saw her. All professionalism. Tightly wound. Beautiful in that intimidating,
     <em>
      don’t even think about it
     </em>
     way. Red lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head, intrigued, as Agatha’s eyes flicked over the room and landed on her.
    </p>
<p>
     The reaction was instantaneous—Agatha froze, a deer caught in headlights, before turning on her heels and heading towards the bar. That was… a little strange.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Meanwhile, Agatha was fighting the urge to bolt.
    </p>
<p>
     It was bad enough that she’d run into Rio at the bookstore, looking like she’d just rolled off her sailboat (which she had). Now Rio was here, in her world, effortlessly magnetic and uncomfortably close.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bourbon,” Agatha said briskly to the bartender, sidling up to the bar like it was the only safe space in the room.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t see Rio approach until the other woman was right beside her, leaning casually against the bar.
    </p>
<p>
     “A red wine, please,” Rio said to the bartender, her voice warm, unhurried. Then, turning to Agatha, “Oh, hello.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s pulse spiked. “Hi,” she said, her tone clipped, measured.
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember me? From the bookstore?” Rio asked, her smile disarmingly genuine.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, I remember you,” Agatha said, the words coming out a little sharper than intended.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’s Nicky?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good. He’s good.” Agatha gripped her bourbon like it was a lifeline. “I have to go over there. Writers, am I right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled, an easy, low sound that made Agatha’s ears burn.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.” Rio’s voice stopped her mid-turn. “It’s Agatha, isn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hesitated, then nodded. “And you’re Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s me,” Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     Without another word, Agatha turned on her heel and disappeared into the crowd.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned back to Lilia, who was surprisingly still conversing with the young writer. She understood him, Lilia screamed comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t believe you were talking to Agatha Harkness,” the young writer whispered conspiratorially, eyes wide.
    </p>
<p>
     “Harkness?” Rio repeated, her words catching on disbelief. “As in—Harkness &amp; Co..?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, from PurpleBooks,” the writer confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's mouth fell open. It felt like a punch to the gut.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Agatha stood at the hors d’oeuvres table, pretending to care about a plate of questionable brie.
    </p>
<p>
     “Harkness? Your last name is Harkness?” Rio’s voice, direct and just a little incredulous.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned, her face schooled into a mask of calm. “Harkness, yes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You own PurpleBooks”.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded slowly, lips pursing.
    </p>
<p>
     “God, I didn’t even fucking realize…” How had she not seen it before? The polished confidence, the air of quiet authority—it all made sense now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, well-” Agatha couldn’t finish her sentence.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were spying on me, weren’t you?” Rio accused, a mix of irritation and disbelief coloring her tone. Then, an amused gleam appeared in her eyes. She scoffed. “You probably rented that kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why would I spy on you?” Agatha countered, incredulous.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I’m your competition. And you know it. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have put up that sign.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha narrowed her eyes. “The entrance to our store is literally around the corner. It’s not a personal attack.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And next, you’ll use twinkle lights, won’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Twinkle lights?” Agatha repeated, her tone dry. “You think I have a twinkle light conspiracy against you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I use them in my windows, and I know you’ve noticed,” Rio said, crossing her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s laugh was sharp. “The only reason I came into your store was to buy Nicky a book. At the one children’s bookstore in the neighborhood. That’s it. You think I care about your twinkle lights?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened her mouth, but no words came out.
    </p>
<p>
     “You probably sell $250,000 worth of books a year,” Agatha said, her voice flat.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you know that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m in the book business.”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     am in the book business.” Rio raised one eyebrow, arms crossed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, half-amused, half-exasperated. “Oh, I see, and we're the Price Club. Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap books. And I am a spy. Look, let’s not turn this into some David-and-Goliath story. You’re charming. Your bookstore’s charming. I’m not out to destroy you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glared at her. “That’s funny, since that is what you are doing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia joined them, immediately sensing the tension.
    </p>
<p>
     “You must be Agatha Harkness,” Lilia said, her smile just as sharp. “Inventor of the superstore, destroyer of small bookstores everywhere. How do you sleep at night?”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could reply, Billy sidled up with his usual effortless charm. “I use Ultrasom. Just half a tablet, and you’re good as new. Don’t take the whole thing, though. Hangover central.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia blinked, caught off guard. “Who the hell are you?” she asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am Billy. And you’re… Oh my god! You are Lilia Calderu, aren’t you? You do tarot readings?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio almost snorted at the random turn of events, if she wasn’t as pissed off as she was.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy lit up. “Oh, yes, you are! Eddie—my partner—told me all about you. You did a reading for him. Life-changing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned audibly, downing the rest of her bourbon.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Later that night, Agatha sat on her bed, laptop open. Señor Scratchy sat beside her. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Do you ever feel like you become the worst version of yourself?”
     </em>
     she typed. “
     <em>
      That Pandora’s Box of all your worst traits—arrogance, spite, condescension—springs open when provoked? Instead of walking away, you zing them. Hello, it’s Ms. Horrible.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     On the other side of the city, Rio stared at her own laptop, reading the message that had popped into her inbox.
    </p>
<p>
     She hit reply.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I know exactly what you mean. The problem is, when I’m provoked, my mind goes blank. I feel cold. I spent all night thinking of what I wished to have said.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s reply came almost immediately:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Wouldn’t it be perfect if I could give you all my zingers, and you could fire them off while I stayed gracious? Though I warn you, when you say the perfect thing in the moment, remorse always follows.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stared at the next line, blinking hard.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Do you think we should meet?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Meet? Oh my God,” Rio whispered to herself, frozen in front of the screen. It wasn’t just something to catch Rio off guard, but DTWR certainly managed to do so.
    </p>
<p>
     She had no idea what to do.

<div>
<p>
     The quiet stretch of 75th Street hummed with morning anticipation as iron gates began their rhythmic ascent, revealing sleepy storefronts waking for the day. Agatha watched from across the street, arms crossed, her gaze fixed on PurpleBooks Superstore’s grand reveal.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a culmination of months of meticulous planning—every detail, every dollar, every sleepless night. The polished electric grate lifted noiselessly, as elegant as she had insisted it be, unveiling a storefront bathed in soft, inviting light. The massive sign overhead declared:
     <b>
      "OPENING DAY: 35% OFF ON ALL BEST-SELLERS."
     </b>
</p>
<p>
     Inside, the superstore unfolded like a vision of modern efficiency. Gleaming staircases reflected the overhead lights, rows of bookshelves stood in perfect symmetry, and employees, their purple shirts neatly pressed, moved like pieces on a chessboard. Even their glittering alligator pins—her idea—seemed to sparkle strategically under the light. The air carried a carefully cultivated aroma of coffee, paper, and the faintest hint of cinnamon.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved through the store with Billy and Herb, the two of them —even Herb—practically buoyant with excitement. She didn’t mind; their enthusiasm added to the energy of the day. By midday, the store was packed, a controlled chaos of voices and movement. Customers queued at the registers, and upstairs, children laughed and tugged at their parents’ hands.
    </p>
<p>
     “No pickets. No demonstrations,” Agatha observed. She had been bracing for resistance, the kind that could tarnish a perfect opening. But there was none.
    </p>
<p>
     “The neighborhood loves us,” Billy said, beaming as if he were personally responsible for their approval.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re probably wondering how they ever lived without us,” Herb added with a chuckle, gesturing toward a mother leading her toddler toward the children’s section.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled faintly, a polite acknowledgment rather than outright agreement. She didn’t need their validation; the numbers on the sales reports would speak louder than any crowd of wide-eyed customers. Still, the absence of trouble was a relief, one she wouldn’t admit aloud.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’s the children’s department?” she asked, as they began their ascent up the grand staircase.
    </p>
<p>
     Herb shrugged. “It’s early. School’s not out yet. And then there’s that children’s bookstore nearby—”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio’s,” Agatha supplied, the name slipping from her lips with practiced neutrality.
    </p>
<p>
     Herb dismissed it with a casual wave. “We’ll crush it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy, however, tilted his head thoughtfully. “She’s fascinating, though, isn’t she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave him a sharp look but said nothing, climbing the stairs. Behind them, the mothers and children followed, their laughter echoing.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     On a quiet stretch of Broadway, Rio rounded the corner, her boots clicking against the pavement as she headed toward her favorite newsstand. The morning was brisk, the air humming with energy as she passed a group of children in pilgrim costumes. She was about to grab a paper when she froze.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was there.
    </p>
<p>
     Her back was to Rio, but the unmistakable posture—the crisp, tailored coat, the confident tilt of her head, her long wavy hair—was impossible to miss. Instinctively, Rio ducked, pretending to examine a nearby wall like it was the Sistine Chapel.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t breathe again until Agatha walked away.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
<em>
      “I don't think it's a good idea for us to meet…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at the email, the words blurring for a second before snapping back into focus. It wasn’t the response she’d hoped for, though she couldn’t say it surprised her.
     <em>
      She
     </em>
     —The Green Witch—had politely declined her suggestion to meet. Politely but firmly.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned back in her chair, one hand drifting to her chin as she re-read the email.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I love our relationship.  There's a lot going on in the day-to-dayness of my life and there's something magical and thrilling about this island in the online realm I have with you.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose, a sound halfway between a laugh and a sigh. Of course, she thought, twirling a pen between her fingers, this is what she got for acting on impulse. For one uncharacteristic moment, she’d let herself slip.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, she’d hit send before she could second-guess herself, convinced that it was the right step forward. She’d imagined the possibilities—a kindred spirit, someone who might understand the parts of her she didn’t show to the world. And now, Agatha regretted not keeping her intrigue safely contained behind a screen. She had already told the woman
     <em>
      so much
     </em>
     —about Nicky, about her past..
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips curved into a small smile. “Can’t win them all,” she murmured to herself. She let the email sit open on her laptop as she glanced out the window. New York hummed outside, alive with the chaos she loved.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, and with a decisive click, she typed out a response:
     <em>
      “I understand completely. Our connection means the world to me too, and I’d never want to jeopardize it. Thank you for being honest—I hope you know how much I value that about you.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha paused, her lips quirking up.
     <em>
      “PS. If you ever change your mind, I’m only an email away.”
     </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
     By dusk, the Rio’s store felt unusually quiet. Thanksgiving decorations adorned the walls, but the warmth they radiated didn’t reach her. She went to sit behind the counter, starting to tally receipts with Lilia and Jen while Alice shelved books nearby.
    </p>
<p>
     “About $1,200 less than the same week last year,” Lilia murmured, her tone grim.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned back in her chair, frowning. “That could be a fluke, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia and Jen exchanged a glance.
    </p>
<p>
     “Or not,” Lilia said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled sharply. “Their store is new. It’s a novelty. This will all shake out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think we should put up more twinkle lights?” Lilia suggested, trying to lighten the mood.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked faintly. “Twinkle lights solve everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice chimed in from the shelves. “What if we have to fold? I’ll never find another job that pays my rent, and I’ll have to move to Brooklyn.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia rolled her eyes. “We won’t. And otherwise I have a spare room.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice smiled weakly at that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tonterías”, Rio muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward, cutting through the banter with a determined edge. “The hell, we’re not folding.”
    </p>
<p>
     The team nodded, but doubt hung thick in the air.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Thanksgiving Eve at Zabar’s was horribly chaotic. Rio cursed herself for doing her groceries at the last minute. Shoppers crammed into narrow aisles, carts bumping into one another as desperate hands reached for last-minute cheeses and dips. Thankfully, she only needed a few more things.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio maneuvered through the crowd, her cart filled with peas, crackers, and plantains, amongst other things. She grumbled under her breath as someone snagged the last of the smoked gouda right in front of her. It was already shaping up to be a nightmare, but then she saw her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t even surprised. The universe had a funny way of showing its hand. It reminded her of the question DTWR asked her a few days ago:
     <em>
      do you believe in chance?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The fact that it had dropped Agatha into her bookstore—a scenario that could’ve been plucked straight from a romcom—only to reveal her as the kind of woman who bulldozed Rio’s life for profit? Classic. And the worst part? Agatha wasn’t even doing it to torment her personally—it was just business. Of course it was.
    </p>
<p>
     And now, because the universe also had a flair for the dramatic, it had decided Agatha needed to show up everywhere Rio went, naturally.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart leapt to her throat as she whipped around, pretending to examine a rack of pre-cut veggies. For a moment, she thought she’d avoided detection. But the store was too small, and the crush of bodies was too dense.
    </p>
<p>
     It was then that she heard Nicky’s unmistakable voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, can I get these?” The kid was holding up a bag of grapes. Agatha didn’t answer him, her attention entirely on the shelves. But she swept his hair out of the boy’s eyes; an amazingly soft gesture.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed. She turned to make a clean getaway, but it was too late. Agatha had materialized two lines over, as if summoned by some cosmic joke, standing there calmly, with Nicky by her side, waiting for the cashier.
    </p>
<p>
     A deep breath. Rio wasn’t about to lose her cool over this.
    </p>
<p>
     She swerved to another line and dragged her cart behind her like it was a shield.
    </p>
<p>
     Reaching for her sunglasses, she shoved them on without a second thought. Sure, it was late November and the sun was long gone. But she didn't really care. At least now she could look as dead-eyed as she felt.
    </p>
<p>
     And maybe, just maybe, she wouldn’t accidentally lock eyes with
     <em>
      those
     </em>
     infuriatingly sharp blue ones.
    </p>
<p>
     The line moved glacially slow. Rio tapped her fingers on the edge of her cart, making no effort to hide her lack of concern.
    </p>
<p>
     At the register, the cashier barely glanced at Rio’s card before saying, “Cash only.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio asked, unimpressed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Cash only,” the cashier repeated, pointing to a small sign.
    </p>
<p>
     The line collectively groaned. “She doesn’t have cash,” someone whispered, and the phrase trickled down the line like gossip.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio snorted, barely hiding her amusement. Seriously? She turned slightly, hoping to slip through unnoticed, but of course, the universe had other plans.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, hello.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s stomach
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     didn’t even drop.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood there, completely unbothered, with a confident smile. Her son was still clutching the grapes, looking completely uninterested in whatever was happening.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you need money?” Agatha asked smoothly, her voice dripping with that calm, condescending sweetness Rio was way too familiar with.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope, I’m good,” Rio replied with a casual shrug. At the sound of her voice, Nicky looked up. “Hey, Storybook lady!” he grinned at her, enthusiastically.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave him a small, confident smile before looking up at Agatha again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve got this.” She wasn’t about to make a scene. She just wanted to finish up and get out of there.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow but didn’t back down. “You sure? You don’t seem fine,” she said, turning to the cashier.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, Rose. Great name. This is Rio. That thing in front of you is a credit card machine. Let’s use it, yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but roll her eyes, but there was no denying Agatha’s smoothness. The cashier, a little thrown off but not about to argue with a woman like Agatha, took the card and processed the payment.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood there, unfazed. Agatha’s ability to get what she wanted was both annoying and oddly impressive. It was like watching someone cut through life with a chainsaw, and honestly, it was distractedly attractive. It made Rio’s anger grow.
    </p>
<p>
     As the cashier bagged her groceries, Agatha turned to Rio, still wearing that obnoxiously calm smile. “Happy Thanksgiving,” she said.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just nodded, barely lifting an eyebrow. “Yeah, sure. Thanks.”

<span>
      Agatha sat back in the plush chair of her apartment, a glass of wine in hand. Her fingertips grazed the rim absentmindedly, but she wasn’t really drinking it. Instead, her eyes lingered on the scene before her: Nicky, perched on the ottoman, singing “Tomorrow” from
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Annie
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      with so much gusto his face turned pink.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Betcha bottom dollar..!” he belted, waving an imaginary mic like he was on Broadway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Next to him, Sharon Hart —No, Davis— clapped enthusiastically, swaying side to side with exaggerated cheer. “Go, Nicky!” she encouraged, her voice breaking into an off-key harmony as she joined in on the chorus.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pressed her tongue to her cheek to hide a smirk. Sharon’s relentless optimism could feel like a steady drip of water on stone—grating, but oddly comforting in its constancy. This time last year, Sharon had been the wild card, a too-eager nanny with a cheerfulness that didn’t fit in Agatha’s neatly curated world. Agatha had almost fired her a dozen times, but Nicky liked her, and that was enough.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Or maybe it wasn’t just that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her smile faltered as the memory of last Thanksgiving crept in. Sharon crying quietly in the kitchen over a store-bought pie, freshly divorced from Mr. Hart. Nicky playing peacemaker, his little hands patting Sharon’s shoulder like he understood all of it. Agatha watching from the doorway, paralyzed by her own lack of instinct. She hadn’t known what to say then—maybe she still didn’t. But they’d muddled through, and now here they were, cobbling together something that vaguely resembled tradition.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The thought made her stomach twist, but not in an unpleasant way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky struck a triumphant pose, holding the last note for longer than his lungs could handle. Sharon burst into applause, and Agatha joined in with a polite clap, lifting her wine glass like it was some kind of toast. “Bravo,” she said dryly. “Truly breathtaking.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky took a dramatic bow, his grin wide. “Thank you, thank you! I’ll be here all week.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “God help us,” Agatha muttered, but the corners of her mouth twitched upward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t be a Grinch,” Sharon teased, wagging a finger at her. “It’s Thanksgiving! You’re supposed to be thankful, remember?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thankful for
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       what
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , exactly?” Agatha replied, swirling her wine lazily. She meant it as a joke, but the question hung in the air longer than she expected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon gave her a look—not pitying, exactly, but softer than usual. “For this,” she said, gesturing around the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You mean my furniture?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, Agatha,” Sharon said patiently, like she was explaining something to Nicky. “For... I don’t know. This weird little family of ours?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted. “This is hardly a Norman Rockwell painting.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe not,” Sharon said. “But it’s real. That counts for something.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha opened her mouth to retort, but the words didn’t come. Sharon had a way of doing that—saying things that sounded corny but left you stuck chewing on them long after the moment passed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She glanced back at Nicky, who was scrolling through the karaoke playlist on their iPad that he had set up with Saron for the occasion. His laughter rang out, and for a moment, Agatha felt something warm and unfamiliar settle in her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t the family she’d imagined for herself—not the one she’d grown up with, and certainly not the one she’d thought she’d have by now. But it was hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fine,” Agatha said at last, draining the last of her wine with a flourish.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky launched into another song, his eyes shining at hers.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      The December dusk wrapped the city in a soft shimmer, the kind of quiet magic that made Rio pause as she adjusted the display window of her shop. Outside, the snow had started to fall, lazy and weightless, dusting the streets with a pearly sheen. Her breath fogged the glass as she leaned closer, adjusting the angle of a handmade ornament—a tiny wooden fox painted with delicate brushstrokes. The tree wasn’t large, but it stood proud, just tall enough to catch the eye of a passerby and whisper of warmth inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio crouched over the box of ornaments at her feet, her fingers sifting through glass bulbs and hand-stitched baubles, each one telling a little story. The lights from the tree reflected faintly in the shop’s glass counters, creating a kaleidoscope of color that filled the quiet space. She found herself lingering on the softness of the moment, until the sound of laughter outside pulled her gaze to the street.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Two women strolled past the shop, their arms weighed down by shiny lavender shopping bags emblazoned with the unmistakable PurpleBooks logo. Rio felt her jaw tighten before she could stop it. The sting of resentment hit like clockwork, even now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Traitors," she muttered under her breath, half-aware of how petty it sounded. She shook her head, reaching back into the box for something she knew was in there—something special. Her fingers brushed against plush velvet, and she pulled out a pair of ruby slipper ornaments.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The slippers glimmered in the tree's twinkle lights, and her throat tightened. These had been her parents’. She turned them over gently, the tiny sequins catching the light like fireflies. Carefully, she hung them near the top of the tree, just slightly off-center. It wasn’t a showpiece. It was personal, and it made her tree feel like hers. A little like home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She straightened and brushed her hands on her jeans, eyes on the ornaments but her thoughts elsewhere. Thanksgiving flashed through her mind—a patchwork memory of too many voices singing slightly off-key, Alice's laughter carrying through the living room like bells. Alice had coaxed Lilia, Jen, and a couple of Rio’s old college friends to gather around her rarely-played piano, turning it into a makeshift choir. Rio had watched from the corner, her arms crossed, pretending to be annoyed as the overly sweet scene unfolded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Except she hadn’t been annoyed, not really. It was hard to admit, even now, but that kind of warmth had started to mean something to her. These friends—they were her family now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She’d never loved Thanksgiving growing up. It had always been quiet, too quiet, just her and a meal that felt more like a duty than a celebration. And though she wasn’t alone now, there were still gaps in the crowd.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What would her parents have taught her if they’d been there? Would they have filled her childhood with stories of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Nochebuena,
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      with the scent of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       lechón asado
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      wafting through the house? Would she have learned to make
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       pasteles
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      by hand or spent hours decorating with family instead of piecing things together alone?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She missed them more this year than she had in a long time, the ache sharper against the joy. What would they think if they could see her now? Rio wondered if she’d inherited her knack for finding beauty in the smallest things from her mother—a perfectly imperfect ornament, a soft snowfall, the warmth of friends singing off-key in a too-crowded room. But there were so many other things she wished she could ask them, about herself, about who she was and why she felt certain ways she couldn’t name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her eyes drifted back to the ruby slippers. Maybe, just maybe, she thought, hanging them here was enough of a connection for now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A knock at the door startled her. Lilia peeked in, bundled in a thick, orange scarf, waving a thermos. “Got hot cocoa for you! Figured you’d still be here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a breath and smiled, the weight in her chest lifting slightly. Family, she thought again, wasn’t always the people you were born to.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<b>
<em>
       “
      </em>
</b>
<em>
<span>
       This is such an odd Christmas…”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stared at the words on the screen, the cursor blinking as if impatient for her reply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “...I find myself missing my parents, who, as you know, have been gone for most of my life. Christmas in New York feels so... loaded, you know? Ice skating, getting trees, holiday traditions. It’s all so bittersweet.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was something she most definitely could relate to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “...I wonder what traditions my parents would’ve passed on to me if they’d been here. I wonder if I would have Puerto Rican traditions, or if I would be just as American as I am now. I love my roots in theory. But it often feels like an incomplete picture. My parents haven’t lived long enough to pass it on to me in ways that feel tangible. I have my Tostones recipe, and sometimes I manage an acceptable arroz con gandules. I have learned it mostly from YouTube tutorials, though.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words weighed on Agatha, pulling her gaze away from the screen for a moment. She let her eyes drift to the dim corner of the room where Señor Scratchy, oblivious to the undercurrents of the human world, was contentedly gnawing a carrot. The faint sound of it filled the otherwise silent apartment, a rhythmic counterpoint to her thoughts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She re-read the email. Her chest tightened at the quiet ache behind her pen pal’s words. Agatha had known, of course, about her loss. But this was different. This was rawer, a wound reopened by the holiday season.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned back in her chair, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. At first, her response came briskly, a defensive reflex against the vulnerable territory she was about to step into:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “It’s hard, isn’t it? Missing people who are woven so deeply into who you are, even if you have never quite known them. You almost expect the missing part to fade with time, but instead, it just sits quietly in the corner, waiting to nudge you when you least expect it.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She paused, her fingers slowing as she reread her own words. Something in them had tugged at her, a thread she wasn’t entirely sure she wanted to pull. But the thread pulled back, unraveling memories she’d kept at arm’s length for years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I think you’ve done something remarkable, though, building your own traditions. That takes resilience—a kind of stubborn optimism, even.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her fingers hesitated. She should leave it at that. Offer comfort, keep the focus on the other woman. But a restless part of her—the part that resented how deeply her own past lingered—kept her typing:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I can’t possibly understand what you are going through. But this is what I am thinking about these days. My father died when I was eight. My mother—who was not exactly the warm-and-fuzzy type, as you know—told me about it over the phone.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stopped, staring at the words as if they belonged to someone else. The memory was stark, vivid, and wholly uninvited. She could still remember the chill in her mother’s voice, the matter-of-fact delivery of the news.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “It was a car accident,”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      she typed slowly.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “I never knew where he was going or who he was with. I think about that all the time.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her chest tightened, and before she could stop it, a tear escaped, sliding hot and unwelcome down her cheek. Agatha blinked quickly, brushing it away with the back of her hand as if to deny it had happened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What the hell,” she muttered, her voice low and sharp in the stillness of the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She straightened in her chair, rolling her shoulders back as if bracing against a cold wind. With a deliberate exhale, she returned to the email, her tone carefully measured, her words chosen with precision.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Anyway. Ancient history. What kind of advice do you need? Can I help?”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She hit send before she could second-guess herself, the email vanishing into the void with a soft whoosh. For a moment, she sat there, staring at the blank screen. The apartment felt impossibly quiet again, the only sound the persistent gnawing from Señor Scratchy’s corner.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pushed herself away from the desk and walked to the window. Outside, the city glittered with its relentless energy, festive and indifferent. She rested her forehead against the cool glass, watching as people hurried past with shopping bags and scarves pulled tight against the cold. Somewhere out there, her father’s absence, and the absence of her mother’s love, echoed in ways she could never articulate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But somewhere in her apartment, she had built something, too. Traditions, resilience, stubborn optimism. Whatever you wanted to call it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The sound of a notification interrupted her trail of thought. She walked back to her desk, and saw The Green Witch’s new email. It was short, and straight to the point:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Actually, can I have your number? If you’re ok with that?”

<p>
     Rio lay propped up in bed, the glow of her laptop screen casting a pale light on her face. She scrolled through DTWR’s latest email, her lips pressed into a thoughtful line. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard as she tried to form a reply, typing a few words, only to delete them seconds later.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Actually, can I have your number? If you’re ok with that?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Her mouse lingered over the send button for a moment as a small twinge of anxiety gripped her. Then, with a quick click, the email was gone.
    </p>
<p>
     Quickly, her laptop pinged with a new message.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I was hoping you’d be online,”
     </em>
     her pen pal’s reply read, followed by her phone number.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked, surprised by the speed of the response. She reached for her phone, saved the number in her contacts, and hesitated before entering the name:
     <em>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3.
     </em>
     She smirked to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Opening her texts, she typed:
     <br/>
<em>
      Hi, it’s your witch.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     As she sent the text, her heart gave an unexpected flutter. She tapped on DTWR’s profile picture, her curiosity rising. But instead of a photo of the woman, it was a serene image of a forest—green trees with dappled sunlight filtering through.
    </p>
<p>
     That was so... mom of her.
    </p>
<p>
     The picture was beautiful but impersonal, and Rio found herself wishing she could see the face behind the words. Then her eyes wandered to her own profile picture, an old photo of her and her friends, arms slung around one another as they stumbled down a street, laughing. The shot was candid and blurry, taken years ago during a drunken night out.
    </p>
<p>
     She hesitated, finger hovering over the “edit” option, before deciding against it.
    </p>
<p>
     Her phone buzzed, pulling her back to the moment.
    </p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
       Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
      </strong>
</span>
<em>
      Hi, Green
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio grinned at the nickname. She leaned back against her pillows, thumb flying over the keyboard.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      I don’t think you can help,
     </em>
     she typed in reply.
    </p>
<p>
     The response came quickly.
    </p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
       Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
      </strong>
</span>
<em>
      Is it about love?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sighed softly, her expression growing serious.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      My business is in trouble. I would love to think what my parents would say, is all. I inherited it from a family friend.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     There was a pause, longer this time. When the reply came, it made Rio raise an eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
       Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
      </strong>
</span>
<em>
      I’m a brilliant businesswoman. It’s what I do best. What’s your business?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      No specifics, remember?
     </em>
     Rio reminded her, smiling faintly at the screen.
    </p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
       Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
      </strong>
</span>
<em>
      Minus specifics, it’s hard to help. Except to say, go to war.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio blinked. She never thought much about DTWR’s work ethic, but was growing more curious. She had never pictured her too business-like, but more in a whimsical, poetic job. As a writer, or something like that. But maybe that had been naive of her. Some people liked to separate their personalities from their work, she guessed. She typed back quickly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      What?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
       Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
      </strong>
</span>
<em>
      You’re at war. " It’s not personal, it’s business. It’s not personal, it’s business.” That mantra has gotten me to where I am today. Recite it every time you feel like you’re losing your nerve. Fight to the death. Channel the confidence of an average white cis man. Haha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio let out a laugh at that, shaking her head. Before she could reply, another text popped up.
    </p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
       Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
      </strong>
</span>
<em>
      I have to go. My son x.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She stared at the message, a little bemused by the abrupt sign-off, but there was something oddly sweet about it.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not personal, it’s business….”, she muttered to herself. Well, that was one way to go up against Agatha—by simply mirroring her. Maybe that was the way.
    </p>
<p>
     She clicked on her chat with Lilia and typed a message.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Lilia, I’ve decided to go to war. Do you still have that friend of yours at
     </em>
     The Independent?
     <em>
      What was her name? Wanda something?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The response was almost immediate.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Lilia:
     </strong>
<em>
      Wanda Maximoff. I’ll text her. This is gonna be good.
     </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
     From the hallway came the faint patter of footsteps. Agatha recognized Nicky’s light, deliberate tread—he always tried not to wake her when he wandered at night. She quickly typed a goodbye before tossing her phone away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come in, sweetheart,” she called softly, and the door creaked open a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky stood in the doorway, clutching his favorite book in one hand, his pajamas rumpled. His eyes were wide, too alert for this hour.
    </p>
<p>
     “I couldn’t sleep,” he admitted, stepping into the room and perching on the edge of her bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed herself upright, the tiredness in her body fading as she took him in. Agatha instinctively moved to sit up, wiping away the last traces of the lingering heaviness. She noticed the fidgeting in his fingers, the way his lips pressed together in that telltale sign that he was trying to be brave.
     <em>
      So much like me
     </em>
     , she thought, and her heart tightened. “Bad dream?” she asked, smoothing a stray lock of hair from his forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     “No.” He hesitated, his gaze darting away before coming back to her face. “I was thinking too much.”
    </p>
<p>
     She smiled gently, leaning back against the headboard. “Ah, the curse of the brilliant mind. What were you thinking about?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky bit his lip, his small fingers fidgeting with the corner of his book. “You seemed... sad today.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart tightened at his words, and she instinctively reached for his hand, stilling his nervous movements. “I wasn’t sad, Nicky. Just... thoughtful. I have a lot on my mind sometimes, but it doesn’t mean I’m unhappy.”
    </p>
<p>
     He nodded, but his expression was uncertain. “It feels like you miss someone. Like—” He broke off, glancing down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like who?” Agatha prompted.
    </p>
<p>
     He shrugged, still not meeting her eyes. “I don’t know. Maybe Grandpa? Or someone else. I just—” He sighed, then finally looked at her. “I don’t like seeing you like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt a wave of guilt, but she didn’t let it show. Instead, she squeezed his hand and gave him a warm smile. “You’re a good person, Nicky. So thoughtful. But you don’t have to worry about me, okay? I promise I’m fine. And if I ever do feel sad, I’ll tell you. No secrets.”
    </p>
<p>
     He studied her face for a long moment, his sharp eyes searching hers as if he could read her mind. Then he nodded, slowly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good.” She reached over and tugged him closer, pulling him into a hug. “Now, how about you let me worry about you instead? What can we do to get you back to sleep? A story? Hot milk?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you read to me? Like when I was a kid?” he asked, holding up the book in his hands.
    </p>
<p>
     She grinned. “Of course, Mr. All Grown Up. Come on.”
    </p>
<p>
     She shifted over, making space for him to climb onto the bed. He nestled against her side, tucking his head under her arm as she opened the book and began to read. She hadn’t read for him in so long.
    </p>
<p>
     As her voice filled the room, she felt his breathing slow and even out, the weight of his small body growing heavier as he drifted off.
    </p>
<p>
     When she was sure he was asleep, Agatha carefully placed the book on the nightstand and pressed a kiss to his forehead.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The next morning, Rio woke to a flood of sunlight pouring through her window. She groaned, squinting at the clock on her nightstand. 8:12 a.m. Too early, considering she’d stayed up past midnight texting with Lilia about strategy. Her phone lit up.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Lilia:
     </strong>
<em>
      Wanda’s in. Call her today. She’s expecting you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda Maximoff, an investigative journalist who’d built a career exposing shady business practices, was exactly the kind of ally Rio needed. Reaching out, however… felt real. Felt unlike the easy, chill way Rio preferred to deal with things. And yet.
     <em>
      Go to war;
     </em>
     it echoed through her head.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Later that day, Rio sat in her shop, her laptop open on the counter. The conversation with Wanda had been productive—more so than she’d expected. Wanda hadn’t just agreed to cover the story; she’d also given Rio advice on how to handle the inevitable backlash. Rio felt lighter now, more focused, like the first pieces of her plan were starting to click into place.
    </p>
<p>
     The shop door jingled, and Rio looked up to see Jen walking in, carrying two steaming cups of coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hear there’s a plan! What is it, fill me in.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a sip of the coffee, the warmth spreading through her chest. “I’m fighting back,” she said finally. “Against PurpleBooks.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen raised an eyebrow. “Well, damn. That’s ambitious. What’s the plan?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned back, a small smile playing on her lips. “Wanda Maximoff, from the Independent, is writing an exposé on them. And I’m putting together a local event—something big, something they can’t ignore. If they want to take my business, they’ll have to fight me for it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen whistled low, her expression equal parts admiration and concern. “That’s… bold. You sure you’re ready for this?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s smile faltered for just a moment, but then she thought of Agatha’s smug smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if I’m ready,” Rio shrugged. “But I’m doing it anyway.”

<p>
     January had brought an unexpected rush to Rio’s store. Customers filled the aisles, browsing through displays with an energy that Rio hadn’t seen in years. It was almost unsettling, this newfound bustle, but she wasn’t about to complain.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda Maximoff stood near the counter, leaning casually against a shelf with a stack of
     <em>
      The Independent
     </em>
     newspapers under her arm. She had an effortlessly polished air about her—scarlett, wavy hair that seemed to frame her sharp cheekbones just right, and a quiet confidence that suggested she was used to being noticed, even when she wasn’t trying.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t know much about her, except for that she owed her for the article.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen, the ever-reliable multitasker, stood by the register, reading aloud from Wanda’s article.
    </p>
<p>
     “‘Rio Vidal has raised your children,’” Jen began, voice dripping with melodrama. “‘If this precious resource is killed by the cold cash cow of PurpleBooks, it will not only be the end of Western civilization as we know it but the end of something even dearer: our neighborhood as we know it. Save
     <em>
      The Shop Around the Corner
     </em>
     and you will save your own soul.’”
    </p>
<p>
     Lowering the paper, she grinned. “Wanda, this is amazing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda gave a half-smile. “You think it’s not a little much?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice, who had been shelving books nearby, jumped in. “Are you kidding? It’s perfect. People eat this kind of thing up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just say thank you,” Lilia called from her spot near the ringing phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Wanda grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Also, Channel 2’s outside,” Lilia added.
    </p>
<p>
     The store was buzzing. Someone had propped open the door to let in fresh air, and Rio could hear the faint hum of the crowd outside.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice intercepted her. “Rio, this is
     <em>
      historic
     </em>
     ,” she said, her hands waving dramatically. “Like, do you realize what’s happening right now? Oh my god, Lilia, how are you even
     <em>
      friends
     </em>
     with Wanda Maximoff? It’s insane!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced over at Wanda, who was flipping idly through a book as if she weren’t the source of all this commotion. “She’s something, all right,” Rio muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia, juggling another call, motioned toward the door with a raised eyebrow. “TV crew’s waiting for you,” she said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Cool,” Rio replied, tucking the notebook under her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     As she passed Wanda, the woman caught her by the sleeve. “Here,” she said, slipping a piece of paper into Rio’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced down at it, then back up at Wanda. “Your number?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just in case,” Wanda said, her expression unreadable.
    </p>
<p>
     “For?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda smirked faintly. “You never know. Press loves a follow-up.” Then, lowering her voice so only Rio could hear, she added, “And I’m always happy to help take down Agatha Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     The name landed like a sharp jab. Before Rio could process it, Wanda gave a small wave and slipped through the crowd.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The Channel 2 news report began with a somber tone, the camera panning across the façade of
     <em>
      The Shop Around the Corner
     </em>
     , a cozy children’s bookstore tucked into a lively West Side neighborhood.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re here in front of
     <em>
      The Shop Around the Corner
     </em>
     ,” the reporter announced, her voice dripping with journalistic drama, “the famous children’s bookstore now on the verge of closing its doors because the big, bad wolf—PurpleBooks—has opened just a few hundred feet away, wooing customers with sharp discounts and designer coffee.”
    </p>
<p>
     Inside the store, Rio stood before the camera, her casual confidence intact despite the somber topic. “They
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to offer discounts and lattes,” she said, her tone cutting. “Most of the people who work there have probably never even read a book.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda, standing beside her, laughed loudly—just a little too loudly, as if her laugh carried a personal edge.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced at her, curious about the sudden sharpness in her amusement, but let it slide.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As Agatha moved with practiced steps on the treadmill, the rhythmic thud of her feet on the rubberized track barely registered in her mind. Her focus was elsewhere—on the flashing television screens above, where the same Channel 2 report looped, broadcasting Rio’s face again and again. Her words hung in the air like an uninvited guest, a presence she couldn’t shake off.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s gaze shifted momentarily from the screen, her lips twisting in a faint scowl. She couldn’t quite suppress the feeling of irritation that flared when she saw Rio, so polished, so poised, all while those carefully curated words were wrapped in the appearance of humility.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not as nice as she seems on television,” Agatha muttered to Billy, who was on the treadmill next to her, half-heartedly keeping pace.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy, ever the skeptic, barely raised an eyebrow in acknowledgment. “I’m sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t let up. She wanted to push the words out, to make them stick like an insult she could throw back at Rio for daring to present herself as something other than what she was. “She’s kind of a pill,” Agatha added, her voice laced with dismissive finality.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy, the observant piece of ass, smirked. “She’s probably not as attractive as she seems on TV either.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked right back, a flicker of something like satisfaction in her voice. “No, she’s beautiful. But still a pill.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy leaned into the handrails, turning his head to give her a sideways glance. “So you don’t feel bad about basically destroying her livelihood? Her legacy? Her reason for existing?”
    </p>
<p>
     The question hit harder than Agatha wanted to admit. She had worked for this moment—the triumph of PurpleBooks, the intellectual cachet she’d fought for. But the reminder of Rio’s human side, her legacy, left a bitter taste at the back of Agatha’s throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Her response came automatically, practiced, a shield she could hide behind. “It’s not personal—”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s business,” Billy finished for her, his voice dripping with irony.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, but she nodded. “Exactly.”
    </p>
<p>
     She returned her gaze to the screen, but this time, it wasn’t Rio that caught her attention. It was Wanda Maximoff, standing beside Rio in the clip, laughing in that way she had—caring and unburdened, as if Agatha’s world and Rio’s collided with ease.
    </p>
<p>
     A needle of discomfort jabbed at Agatha as Wanda’s laugh echoed in her mind. She couldn’t stop herself from tightening her grip on the treadmill controls, her pulse quickening. The camera lingered on Wanda for a moment, before it flicked back to Agatha’s interview. There she was, framed in crisp studio lighting, looking every bit the professional businesswoman.
    </p>
<p>
     Her own voice filled the space between them.
     <em>
      “I sell cheap books,”
     </em>
     she had said in the interview,
     <em>
      “Sue me. I sell cheap books, and as a result—listen to this, because it’s really bad—more people can buy books.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The words hung in the air like a challenge, an invitation to dismiss her, to overlook the actual work she had done. The editing team had cut out everything else—her pride in the selection of books, the fact that they housed over 150,000 titles, the way her store had become an unlikely cultural hub. The “piazza” as she had called it. A place to gather, to exchange ideas, a place where people could lose themselves in stories.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy slowed his pace beside her, shaking his head with an incredulous grin. “That’s what you said?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bristled, her fingers tightening on the treadmill’s controls. “That’s not all I said! Those fuckers cut out everything else! I talked about how people can come and sit and read for hours, how no one bothers them. I talked about the New York City section—showed them the damn thing!”
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice began to rise, frustration bubbling up. “I told them PurpleBooks is a goddamn piazza. A place where people can mingle and mix and
     <em>
      be
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy tilted his head, trying to stifle his grin. “A piazza?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, a piazza!” Agatha shot back, her tone almost defensive. “I was eloquent, Billy. I was persuasive. They made me look like a fool.” She let out an exasperated sigh, leaning on the treadmill’s handrails as her pace slowed. “And now… now people are going to turn Rio into Joan of Arc.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy raised an eyebrow, utterly amused. “And you into Attila the Hun.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waved him off dismissively. “It’s not me personally. It’s the company. People don’t see the work. They don’t get it.”
    </p>
<p>
     But just as she thought she could brush the irritation aside, Rio’s voice sliced through the tension in the gym, louder this time, and more direct.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I have to say,” Rio was saying from outside her shop during the interview, “I’ve met Agatha Harkness, the owner of PurpleBooks, and I’ve heard her compare her store to a Price Club and the books in it to cans of olive oil.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her jaw tightening involuntarily.
     <em>
      Cans of olive oil
     </em>
     . The words tasted like ash in her mouth as they were spoken, deliberately cruel in their simplicity.
     <em>
      Cans of olive oil
     </em>
     , Rio had said, as though everything Agatha had built could be reduced to a commodity.
    </p>
<p>
     Her stomach churned as she glanced at Wanda again, standing there beside Rio, as though they were united in their dismissal of her. Wanda—
     <em>
      Wanda
     </em>
     —who had once shared her bed for a single night, a momentary lapse in judgment that seemed so irrelevant now, but it wasn’t the night she regretted. Or the fact that she had ghosted Wanda the next morning. It was the way Wanda had dug into her life afterwards, her history. Charm had never been enough to mask that journalistic curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     It was whatever, now. But she couldn’t deny the annoyance that now stirred in her chest seeing Wanda reappearing like this, laughing with Rio on national television, mocking her in front of millions.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, isn’t this just peachy,” Agatha muttered under her breath, her hands gripping the treadmill with white-knuckled force. The TV screen flashed in her peripheral vision like a strobe.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The next day, a small rally had gathered outside the store. Hand-painted picket signs bobbed above the crowd, bearing slogans like
     <em>
      Save Our Neighborhood
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      Shop Small, Live Big
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood on a makeshift speaker’s platform. Beside her was Lilia, who was nodding along solemnly as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled devilishly as she scanned the crowd, her eyes gleaming with determination.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s end PurpleBooks. I was thinking….
     <em>
      Death
     </em>
     by a thousand cuts.”
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn’t a Joan of Arc, nor did she want to be. But she’d fight tooth and nail for her store and her neighborhood—and she was just getting started.

      It was dusk when Rio flipped the
     </span>

<span>
      sign to
     </span>

</em>
<span>
      and locked the door to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Shop Around the Corner
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Inside, Jen was animatedly talking while Lilia sat behind the counter, tallying up the week’s receipts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “...and I can’t decide whether to put vegan sausages into the sauce or just cheese,” Jen was saying, her hands flailing with dramatic flair. “Last time I made it, we never even sat down to dinner because—” She made an exaggerated hand gesture that left no room for subtlety.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Spare us,” Lilia interjected dryly without looking up from her ledger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smirked and headed for the door, leaving Rio and Lilia in a bubble of silence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to Lilia. “Don’t tell me,” she said, her voice edged with a nervous anticipation. “Not the slightest difference?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia hesitated, her expression tight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed, throwing her hands up. “How could that be? All this publicity and not one bit of difference? What the hell am I going to do?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed. She wished there was someone she could talk to, someone who understood her in a way words couldn’t capture. The kind of person you could look at and they’d know exactly what you meant—no explanation needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She thought of DTWR, of how easy it had been to share with her, to feel like she didn’t have to hide anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wished she could return to a home, to the warmth of the woman's presence, maybe with the sound of her son’s laughter in the background and Scratchy hopping around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a foolish daydream, a glimpse of a life that was so far from her reach. She shook her head, brushing the thoughts away.

<p>
<span>
      Dear You,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I thought I’d open our good old Gmail convo again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It didn’t work. I went to war. And against all odds, I enjoyed it. Turns out, fighting for what you believe in is weirdly satisfying—who knew? I’ve spent most of my life taking the easier path, where no one gets upset, and I can pretend everything’s fine. But now? Now I’m some kind of crusader, charging into battle. However, my business is still in trouble. But I will keep trying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Which brings me to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       you
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Here’s the thing: I am undeniably, embarrassingly falling for you. You, a person I’ve never even met. I am 38 years old, and this should not be happening. But here we are. You’ve turned me into one of those people who stares wistfully at nothing and sighs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It’s absurd, really. People ask me if there’s someone in my life, and I want to say yes, except how do I explain that my “special someone” is an anonymous email pen pal? They’d probably stage an intervention.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So, I need to know. Do you feel the same way? Does your heart beat for me (because mine does for you)? Please, say yes. Lie if you have to. Tell me you sit around thinking about me, too—because if you don’t, I might have to throw my laptop out the window.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And listen, I’m not trying to pressure you. I know I’m the one who didn't want to meet in person. But I’m slowly losing my grip on reality here. I need to know where we stand.

      Regarding your question
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Dear Green,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      First off, your email was a masterpiece of spiraling. Truly, it should be framed ;)
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, onto the actual content. Yes, I think of you. All the time. Probably more than is healthy. You’ve become this constant presence in my mind, which is both wonderful and mildly alarming. It’s like I have a ghost haunting me, except the ghost is witty, kind, and drives me to distraction with every email.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And yes, it’s insane. I should be past the age where I’m undone by someone I’ve never met. I want to think of myself as wise and stoic. Instead, here I am, getting derailed by someone whose name isn’t even in my contacts. You’ve ruined me. I hope you’re happy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So, you asked if you’re alone in this, and the answer is no. Not even close. I keep a mental list of things to tell you—things that remind me of you or things I know you’d laugh at. It’s like we’ve been dating for years, except we skipped all the normal stuff, like dates or, you know…
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So, where do we go from here? I don’t have the answer. I just know that whatever this is, it’s real to me. Real enough that I find myself hoping you never stop emailing me, even if you do make me feel like a lovesick teenager (at 47…….)
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And last but definitely not least: I am so sorry about your business. If you want to talk about it more, feel free.
     </span>

      Rio stared at her screen, her thumb hovering over the trackpad as DTWR’s words settled into her mind like a gentle, chaotic storm. She reread the email—twice, maybe three times—letting the humor and self-deprecation soak in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You’ve ruined me. I hope you’re happy.”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She bit her lip, caught between relief and disbelief. She closed the laptop with a sigh and cursed the butterflies in her stomach— they were swirling like crazy.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      By the time Rio finished locking the store, night had fallen, and the rain had started. She pulled her hood over her head, ready to walk home. She felt cozy, the warmth in her body caused by the mail had spread everywhere.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, a shadow stepped into her path. A woman, scarlet hair. Green eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She jumped, startled. “Oh my god, Wanda? What are you doing here?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda, unbothered by the rain or Rio’s reaction, grinned mischievously. “Waiting for you,” she said, her grin widening. “Casually, though.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed despite herself. Wanda whipped out an umbrella, opening it over the both of them with a flourish.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You look beautiful,” Wanda said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes. “Thanks. But I’m a wreck.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s gaze lingered, and she reached out, her fingers brushing Rio’s cheek. Rio flinched slightly at the unexpected contact.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Relax,” Wanda murmured, blowing on her fingers. “It was an eyelash. Gone now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blinked, then shook her head with a bemused laugh. “Should I be worried you’re writing another article?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda tucked the umbrella closer, keeping them both dry as they started walking. “Maybe. This one’s about someone on a quest for knowledge who meets a woman they cannot resist,” she said, her tone teasing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio snorted. “Uh-huh. Sounds scandalous.” She hesitated, sensing where this was going. “Should I discount? Maybe that would help. But if I discount, I’d have to fire someone. And I can’t fire anyone since—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Without warning, Wanda reached out, her hand threading through Rio’s damp hair. Rio froze, pulling back slowly. Sure, Wanda was beautiful. But Rio's interest lay elsewhere.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No offense, but I don't think we're on the same page,” she said, stepping away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda tilted her head, looking at Rio with a mix of curiosity and disappointment. “I thought there was something here,” she said quietly. “At least a shared revenge against Agatha?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed, her voice soft but firm. “Sorry, Wanda. I’m grateful for everything—the article, your support—but I’m not interested. And besides, what did Agatha even do to you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda chuckled, though it was tinged with bitterness. “The same thing you’re doing now,” she said, her smile wry. “Why do women with long, dark hair keep breaking my heart?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At that line Rio couldn’t help but snort. “Hey,” she said, bumping Wanda lightly with her shoulder, “maybe you’re just a little more romantically inclined than the dark-haired women in question.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She placed a hand on Wanda’s upper arm, giving it a light squeeze. “I hope you find your U-Haul girlfriend someday,” she added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then she stepped away, out in the rain.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If you change your mind,” Wanda called after her, “Lilia has my email!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio waved without turning back, the moment already fading behind her.

      So, this happened..

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hiya,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      First off, your last email? Let’s just say it did a number on me. I’ve been grinning and cringing at myself all day. It’s unfair, really.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Anyway, right after reading your words and going through the predictable spiral of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “Do I deserve this? Am I dreaming? Am I just ridiculous?”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , something happened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A woman I’ve known for a little while—smart, stunning, and entirely too smooth—made her move. I’d had my suspicions earlier, but last night she went for it. She leaned in, said the right things, made it clear she was interested. And in that moment, I realized something.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I realized I was comparing her to you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Which is absurd, isn’t it? Because technically, I don’t even know you. But as she stood there, smiling, waiting for me to say something, all I could think was,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “You’re lovely, but you’re not her.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It’s wild. People would probably call me a fool for turning her down. But here I am, a fool who wants you, whoever you are, wherever you are.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So yeah. That’s where I’m at.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yours,

      The Green Witch
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      The rain tapped insistently against Rio’s apartment window, a steady rhythm that filled the quiet room. Her phone screen lit up on the couch beside her, the familiar buzz sending a thrill through her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:

<em>
<span>
       Do you think this is funny?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio frowned, her stomach flipping. A simmering sense of panic began to rise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
     </b>
<em>
<span>
       Are you purposely making me jealous? Making me feel all bothered?

</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       Tell me, did she at least have good taste in blazers?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t help but snort, her tension melting into a grin. Of course, this woman would weaponize jealousy into humor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She typed back, her fingers quick on the keys:
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>
       I told you, all I could think about was you. I didn’t even notice if she was wearing a blazer.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The reply was instant:
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
     </b>
<em>
<span>
       You should know I own a lot of blazers. Practically live in them.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow, amused. The tiniest details of DTWR’s life always stoked her curiosity. Who was this mysterious woman with her apparent wardrobe of power suits?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She typed:
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Jealousy aside, you should feel flattered.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
     </b>
<em>
<span>
       Oh, I am. Smug, even.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Good. And for the record, I’d love to see you in a blazer.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The next message made Rio pause, her grin softening into something more thoughtful:
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
     </b>
<em>
<span>
       That would make this a lot easier. Here I am, trying to win you over with words alone.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit her lip. A few months ago, she was certain she didn’t want to meet DTWR in real life. The fear of disappointment—or worse, the fear of something real—had kept her resolute. But now, she felt her curiosity breaking through those walls, piece by piece.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Another message arrived:
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
     </b>
<em>
<span>
       You know I’d never ask you to turn someone down for me, right?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And there it was. Rio felt the truth settle in her chest: she wanted DTWR’s jealousy to be real, wanted to belong to her in a way that felt definitive, serious. Wanted to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       be
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her fingers hovered over the keyboard before she finally typed:
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>
       What if I wanted you to?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The reply came swiftly, unflinchingly direct:
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
     </b>
<em>
<span>

      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a short laugh, though her heart thudded in her chest. The woman didn’t pull her punches, and Rio appreciated that. But it wasn’t exactly what she meant.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
     </b>
<em>
<span>
       Not to kill the romance of all that, but I’m not sure how long that would work for me. Not saying no, yet ;)
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed, setting her phone down for a moment. She leaned her head against the window, watching the rain streak across the glass. DTWR wasn’t wrong. This liminal space between connection and reality couldn’t last forever.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She picked up the phone again.
     </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>
       You’re right. Give me a second to collect my thoughts.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:
     </b>
<em>
<span>
       Of course. No pressure.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio closed her eyes, taking a few deep breaths. The fear was still there, but under it was something stronger: the need to move forward, to turn this connection into something more tangible. She opened her eyes and typed a message, her heart racing.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Across the city, Agatha was propped up in bed, a book open on her lap, though she hadn’t turned a page in over fifteen minutes. The rhythmic patter of rain on the window filled the room, soothing yet restless, much like her thoughts. She was staring at her own reflection in the phone screen in front of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The woman was taking her time forming a response. It was understandable—Agatha had been pretty straight forward. But, like her pen pal confessed earlier, she
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       too
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      was slowly losing her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had basically found herself talking about a relationship before she knew it. Just
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       how
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      had they ended up here?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, her screen lit up. And her breath caught in her throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words of the message were simple, but they hit like a jolt of caffeine.

      The fluorescent lights of the Nut Shop on Broadway buzzed faintly overhead, casting a stark glow on the rainbow-colored lollipop display. Rio reached out, selecting a few purple and green ones, their glossy wrappers crinkling as she dropped them into her tote.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Behind her, Jen and Alice stood by a shelf of candied pecans, their skeptical expressions synchronized like a chorus of disapproval.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So,” Jen started, her voice cutting through the Nut Shop’s soft jazz playlist, “you’re really meeting her? After everything?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tightened her grip on her tote straps and turned to face them. “Yes, and we’re meeting in a public place. Relax.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice narrowed her eyes. “Don’t go anywhere with her. Don’t even step outside to hail a cab together. Order one ahead of time and have it wait for you. In fact, text us the plate number when it gets there.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio resisted the urge to roll her eyes. “Okay, Mom.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice didn’t flinch. “I’m serious, Rio. You don’t even know her real name.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s with you two?” Rio shot back. “Last week, you were pressuring me to meet her, saying I needed to ‘get out there’ and stop hiding. Now suddenly, it’s too dangerous?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen shrugged, her voice softer but no less skeptical. “It’s just... meeting someone like this, it’s a leap, Rio. And leaps are risky.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed and forced a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Life’s risky. But I’m not stupid. I’ve thought this through.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice remained unconvinced, her frown deepening. “Where are you meeting her? And don’t say some dive bar.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not a bar,” Rio replied with a huff, slipping the candies into her bag. “It’s that café on 83rd. The one with the cheesecake.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen’s skeptical expression turned playful, her lips quirking into a smirk. “Oh, perfect. Let me guess—she’s going to show up wearing a flower in her lapel, and you’ll be clutching
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Anna Karenina
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      with a rose tucked inside?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio allowed herself a genuine laugh, the tension easing just slightly. “Close,” she countered, her grin crooked. “But it’s
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Pride and Prejudice
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , actually.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Jen and Alice exchanged a wary glance, Rio turned back to the display of lollipops, pretending to deliberate over her choices.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s just coffee,” she said, more to herself than to her friends. “What’s the worst that could happen?”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      The rain had stopped, leaving behind a cool, damp stillness that clung to the air. Agatha walked briskly, her heels clicking against the slick pavement in sharp, purposeful beats. Billy strolled beside her, his hands stuffed casually in his pockets, his presence comforting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So,” Billy said, breaking the silence with his usual irreverence, “is she carrying a book with a flower in it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shot him a sidelong glare, but the comment stuck.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I sure hope she is.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Her heart fluttered against her ribs, a sensation she hated for its helplessness. She wasn’t used to being this person—restless, anxious, and completely out of her depth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not really..?” Billy teased, his grin infuriatingly smug.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Really,” she retorted, her voice tight. She was already regretting this entire endeavor, and Billy wasn’t making it easier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He tilted his head, studying her with mock curiosity. “So which Jane Austen is it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha exhaled sharply, caving to his persistence. “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Pride and Prejudice.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy’s laugh was warm and unbothered, the opposite of how Agatha felt. “She could be a total ass, you know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, her patience fraying. “I know,” she snapped, but her voice lacked conviction. “Look, I could always stay for only ten minutes. I’ll say hello, drink a cup of coffee, and leave. Done.” The words felt rehearsed, like a script she was repeating to convince herself as much as Billy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She hesitated, then added in a quieter voice, “Walk me there, okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy shrugged, the gesture maddeningly nonchalant. “Sure.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they turned the corner onto 83rd Street, Café Lalo’s warm lights came into view, glowing like a promise—or a trap. Agatha’s steps faltered, her nerves clawing at her resolve. The cafe looked too inviting, too exposed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What if she has a high, squeaky voice?” Agatha muttered under her breath. “I hate that. It’s like those annoying mice in
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Cinderella.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky loved that film when he was younger. They watched it a thousand times. But god,
      <em>
       those mice.
      </em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy frowned. “What mice in
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Cinderella
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Gus-Gus and—” Agatha waved a hand, exasperated. “Why am I doing this? I’m ruining a perfectly good thing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy smirked. “You’re taking it to the next level,” he said with the air of someone who’d mastered the art of risky moves. “That’s what I do. Every time. If it works, I take it further. Eddie—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Billy,” she cut him off, stopping in her tracks. Her voice dropped to a whisper, almost desperate. “This woman is the most adorable creature I’ve ever come in contact with. If she’s even half as attractive as a mailbox, I’d be crazy not to turn my life upside down and marry her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy chuckled, clearly enjoying her unraveling. “She could still be an ass.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s stomach twisted. “Go look,” she said urgently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just go to the window and check her out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy raised an eyebrow, his smirk widening. “You’re pathetic.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please,” Agatha hissed, her voice cracking with a mix of panic and hope.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With an exaggerated sigh, Billy ambled toward the cafe window, peering inside like a spy on a ridiculous mission. Agatha stood frozen, holding her breath as she watched him through the corner of her eye.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well?” she demanded when he returned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy’s expression was maddeningly unreadable. “There’s a woman inside,” he reported matter-of-factly. “Beautiful. Very beautiful. But no book. Wait—there’s a book. And a flower. That’s got to be her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s pulse quickened. “What does she look like?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy squinted, feigning deliberation. “There’s a waiter in the way—hold on.” He leaned closer to the window, taking his sweet time, while Agatha’s nerves frayed with every passing second.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Finally, he turned back to her, his face lit with mischief. “She kind of looks like—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Like who?” Agatha demanded, her voice sharp.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy hesitated. “Like that Rio Vidal person.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha froze, her stomach dropping. “Rio Vidal from
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Shop Around the Corner
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy shrugged as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “Why not? You said you thought she was attractive.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s irrelevant,” Agatha snapped, her voice rising. “Who cares about Rio Vidal?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy grinned. “If you don’t like Rio Vidal, you’re not gonna like this girl. Because it is Rio Vidal.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?” The word came out in a strangled gasp. Without thinking, Agatha shoved past Billy and pressed her face to the glass. Sure enough, there was Rio, sitting at a small table. Her hands cradled a teacup, and beside her, a book with a crimson rose rested like a silent confession.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s breath caught. Rio looked just as she remembered—confident, poised. In anticipation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, God,” Agatha muttered, stepping back as panic surged through her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy’s voice broke through her spiral. “What are you going to do?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nothing,” she said firmly. “I’m leaving.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy gawked at her. “You’re just going to let her sit there?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But she wrote the letters!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Goodnight, Billy,” Agatha snapped. She turned on her heel and walked away, her steps quick and determined. The damp air clung to her skin as she disappeared into the night, leaving Billy behind, shaking his head in disbelief.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t leave, not really. She stood just around the corner of the cafe, her back pressed against a cool brick wall. The steady hum of the city filled the air around her, but in that moment, everything felt distant.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wasn’t sure why, but the sight of Rio sitting alone at a table made her stomach twist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, sitting there with her copy of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Pride and Prejudice
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . She was just a woman at a table, a pretty stranger who hated her, though to Agatha she was, suddenly, so much more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words they’d shared in their letters had meant everything to her—had made her feel understood, seen, alive in a way no one had before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She knew that Rio would not be happy to see her. She would probably not even
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       think
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      about the option of Agatha being DTWR.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could hardly blame her. After all, Rio had no reason to suspect that the very woman she loathed —the one who had pushed her buttons, was putting her out of business— was also the same woman who had poured her heart out under the guise of DTWR. That
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       other
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      woman. And oh, how Agatha’s guilt doubled in thousands right then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Slowly, Agatha walked back to the cafe and looked at Rio through the window. Her posture was relaxed, peaceful even, yet it made Agatha feel even more unsure of what to do. Rio wasn’t waiting for anyone. Or at least, not waiting for
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       her
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Agatha could see the emptiness in the chair across from her—the chair meant for the person she
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       thought
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      she was meeting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was agonizing. Agatha had been so sure, so certain that this moment would feel like magic when it finally came. She had imagined it a thousand times: the meeting of the two women, the reveal of who they were — the romantic notion of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       finally
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      seeing each other. But now that she was here, standing just outside the door, all she could think about was how much she wanted to turn and walk away. How she could easily slip back into anonymity, let Rio keep the fantasy, and walk out of her life for good.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And also: what if Rio didn’t want anything to do with Agatha, or rather, with DTWR, once she realized who she was? Agatha felt a pang of fear. What if Rio saw her as nothing more than a hypocrite — just the person who had played at being kind and thoughtful in letters but who had been dismissive and rude in real life? What if Rio walked out, never wanting to speak to her again? That would be fair, honestly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The door to the cafe opened behind her, and a couple strolled past her, laughing together. The rush of the crowd on the street reminded Agatha of how out of place she felt in this moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And yet, she couldn’t quite leave.

<span>
      Inside the café, Rio sat at a small table, trying and failing to look casual. Her cup of tea had cooled enough to leave a thin film on top, but it didn’t matter. She had bigger problems—mainly the glaring one in front of her. A battered copy of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Pride and Prejudice
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      lay beside her tea, a crimson rose on top.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She checked her watch again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe she was being unfair. It wasn’t exactly
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       late
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      yet, but the anticipation had been gnawing at her. She had
     </span>
<span>
      scheduled
     </span>
<span>
      this, after all. She glanced at the door again, the hopeful flutter in her chest rising each time it opened. Each time, her heart lifted, then promptly deflated when it wasn’t her date.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had sent a text a minute ago— she didn’t want to send another one, but then again, there was no reply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She blew out a frustrated breath, trying to focus on her book, but then— A guy plopped down at the table next to hers, a man who apparently hadn’t even considered the idea of looking at his surroundings before reaching for her chair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you mind?” Rio snapped, eyeing him sharply.
     </span>
<span>
      He blinked at her, clearly not understanding what she meant. She gave a shove to the chair, reclaiming it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her patience was wearing thinner than the pages of her book, but then, just as she started to close it entirely in frustration, the door opened once more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hope flickered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then... extinguished. But her body started to buzz.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Of course. Of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       course
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      it was her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sauntered in like she was the star of the damn show. All confidence, like she hadn’t just wrecked Rio’s entire evening with her very existence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Rio Vidal," Agatha said, eyes twinkling with that infuriating smile. "What a coincidence. Mind if I sit?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s lips tightened into a thin line. “Yes, I do. I’m expecting someone.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t even acknowledge her refusal, instead picking up Rio’s book like she had every right to. “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Pride and Prejudice
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ,” she mused, running a finger down the spine. “What a surprise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio snatched it back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha only grinned wider, unaffected. “I didn’t know you were a Jane Austen fan,” she continued. “Not surprising. I bet you read it every year. I bet you love Mr. Darcy and swoon over the thought of him and that lady ending up together.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s jaw clenched. Her patience was officially gone. “Would you please leave?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead of leaving, Agatha flopped into the chair across from her, casual as anything. “I’ll leave as soon as your friend shows up. Are they late?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blinked, disbelief rising.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Why did I think this could go differently?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Elizabeth Bennet,” Rio said, her voice dripping with sarcasm, “
      <em>
       that
      </em>
</span>
<em>
<span>
       lady
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , is one of the greatest, most complex characters ever written. Not that you’d understand.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyebrows arched in amusement. “I’ve read it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, good for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned in a bit closer, her tone shifting into something more provocative. “I think you’d discover a lot if you got to know me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio barked out a laugh. “If I really knew you? I’d find a cash register where your brain should be, and a bottom line instead of a heart.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words hit harder than Rio expected. For a second, she wasn’t sure if it was anger or the ridiculousness of the situation that made her want to laugh. She pressed her hand to her forehead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What is it?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “I just had a breakthrough, and I have to thank you for it. For the first time in my life, when confronted with a horrible, insensitive person, I actually knew what I wanted to say... and I said it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A beat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyes glimmered. “I think you have a gift for it. It was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s breath caught. Was she
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       complimenting
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      her? After she said something so straight-up mean to her?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She grabbed for her book again, but as Agatha lifted it, the crimson rose slipped free, tumbling from the pages and into Agatha’s hand. Agatha twirled it, holding it to her lips like a ridiculous mustache.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s all a joke to you, isn’t it?” Rio snapped. “Everything’s a joke.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha threw her arms up defensively, standing. “Hey, I am just trying to lighten your mood, for God’s sake.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She walked away, heading to the table next to hers. Rio tried to steady herself, breathing out a frustrated sigh. She was fighting the urge to slam her head against the table. And then the door opened.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Hope, just a flicker.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But it wasn’t her date.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A woman entered, pleasant enough, followed by another pleasant woman. The sight made Rio’s heart sink just a little. She slumped in her chair for a moment, the wind suddenly gone from her sails. She reached for her bag, the tiny mirror in it, quickly glancing at her reflection.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then, her heart skipped—because there Agatha was, leaning toward her from the adjacent table, eyes glancing sideways at her. Rio quickly turned her face away, as though she hadn’t just been caught.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked down at her bag, the mirror still angled behind her. Her lipstick was fine. She dabbed it anyway, pretending she hadn’t just had an internal crisis over
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       fucking nothing
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But then came the voice, smooth and casual, like she had all the time in the world: “You know what the handkerchief reminds me of?” Agatha’s voice danced in her ears. “The first day I met you—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio interrupted, unable to stop herself. “The first day you lied to me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t lie to you—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You did too—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did
      <em>
       not
      </em>
      ” Agatha insisted, sounding absurdly defensive for someone who
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       was
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      probably lying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rolled her eyes. “Oh, I thought all that stuff with Nicky was so charming. About you buying all the books.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked. “I never lied about it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, really?” Rio raised an eyebrow. “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha. Just call me Agatha
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ,” she mocked, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “As if you were one of those stupid 22-year-old girls with no last name. ‘Hi, I’m Kimberley.’ ‘Hi, I’m Jules.’ What’s wrong with them? Don’t they know they’re supposed to have last names? It’s like they’re all cocktail waitresses.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stopped herself abruptly. That tangent had come out of nowhere, and she wasn’t sure why it had even felt like a good one to take. But she was already halfway through her rant, so—
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood up again, though, like a damn whirlwind, and planted herself right back at her original table. “I am
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       not
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      a stupid 22-year-old girl.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s not what I meant,” Rio sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sucked in her cheeks. “And when I said the thing about the Price Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn’t what I meant either—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire. I feel so sorry for you,” Rio said, as though the sarcasm was the only thing keeping her from genuinely laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The door opened again, and Rio couldn't help herself—her eyes flicked to it in a final, desperate hope.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      An elderly woman entered, and Rio blinked in disbelief.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's voice came at her like a dart. “I’m going to take a wild guess that this isn't her, either.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt a laugh bubbling up. All of this was so stupid. She threw a quick look at the woman who had just sat down with her date, then turned back to Agatha. “Shut up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Who is she, I wonder?” Agatha mused aloud. “Will you be mean to her too? Will you start out sweet as sugar candy and then, suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, find that sharp little tongue of yours?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt the old frustration bubbling up again. It wasn’t her who was the problem.
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha was the mean one.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Rio
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      never asked for this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” Rio dragged, slowly, her voice biting with forced calm, “I won’t. Because the woman who’s coming here tonight is completely unlike you.” She leaned forward slightly, the words spilling out before she could stop them. “The woman who is coming here is kind and funny. She has the most wonderful sense of humor—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cut her off. “But she’s not here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And there it was. Agatha, of all people, was the one to throw it in her face: the woman she had been waiting for, the one she’d hoped would walk through that door and save her from this ridiculous encounter, wasn’t coming. Not tonight. Maybe not at all.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s breath caught for a second, the words hanging between them, heavy and awful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       She’s not coming.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It took all of Rio’s self-control not to let that realization show on her face. She swallowed, her throat tight, trying to hold onto the last shred of dignity. But Agatha's smile, that awful knowing smile, made her feel exposed, raw. She’d never thought she’d let Agatha be the one to see it—see her like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If she’s not here,” Rio managed, her voice suddenly cold, “she has a reason. Because there isn’t a cruel or careless bone in her body. I can’t expect you to understand that, though.” Her gaze flicked to Agatha. “You’ve nothing but a suit.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A beat of silence passed between them. For just a second, Agatha’s expression changed. The playful glint in her eyes disappeared, replaced by something else. Rio didn’t know how to read it, but it unsettled her in a way she didn’t want to admit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then, Agatha stood up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s my cue,” she said, her voice no longer teasing, but strangely sincere. “Good night.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t look back as she walked away, but Rio could feel that strange weight in the air. She was left staring at the empty chair across from her—wondering just what the hell had just happened.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      That night, Rio walked down the street, her steps slow and deliberate. She tossed the flower in a trash can. She was sullen and disappointed—and felt something akin to being disrespected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she got home, Rio entered her apartment, her mood heavy. She dropped the book she was holding onto the table and shrugged off her coat. Her phone came out of her pocket almost automatically, but when she checked, there were no new messages—only the ones she had sent. She stared at the conversation, each text she had written still sitting there, unanswered:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Hey, I’m inside.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      Five minutes later:
      <em>
       Are we still on for tonight?
      </em>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
      Ten minutes later:
      <em>
       Are you on your way?
      </em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Another ten minutes later:
      <em>
       I guess I’ll stay for one minute and then leave. Thanks for nothing.
      </em>
</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Meanwhile, Agatha was in her apartment, hanging up her jacket after turning on the closet light. Her phone was turned off, and she moved through her space, preparing for the night ahead. Sharon, the nanny, was in the other kitchen, welcoming her loudly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "So I said to her, 'If you think I will even talk to you about meatloaf when that is what you served me—’"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s face was barely able to hide her irritation. She was trying to get Sharon to leave—oh, did she want to sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The woman was wonderful, really, but she couldn't take a hint.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thirty minutes later,

      she pressed a kiss on Nicky's forehead. It made her heart feel a little less hollow.

<h2>
     The Aftermath
    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
<em>
      Rio was back at the market, her arms filled with overripe mangoes. She tried to set them down, but the pile only grew heavier, slipping through her fingers like syrup.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She glanced up, her frustration building—and there Agatha was, leaning casually against a stack of crates, watching her with an amused smirk.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She was wearing that dark coat she always seemed to have on, her arms crossed like she was waiting for Rio to make the first move.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "You look busy," Agatha said, her voice carrying the same teasing lilt that always made Rio’s teeth clench.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “I don’t have time for this,” Rio shot back, turning her attention to the mess of fruit.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Sure you do,” Agatha said, stepping closer.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Her presence was magnetic, drawing Rio’s focus whether she wanted it or not.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Come on, Rio, let me help you.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      The way Agatha said it sent a ripple of something unfamiliar down her spine.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Before she could protest, Agatha knelt beside her, her hands brushing against Rio’s as she reached for a mango. The touch was brief but electric, a jolt that made Rio’s breath hitch.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “What are you doing?” Rio asked, her voice sharper than she intended, though the words felt hollow.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha’s smirk softened into something almost tender. “Helping you,” she said simply. Her gaze was steady, her hands deliberate as she worked beside Rio.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      It felt uncharacteristically kind, and it threw Rio off balance.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Suddenly, they were no longer in the market but somewhere else entirely—a dimly lit room filled with bookshelves and the scent of old pages. Agatha stood close, too close, her hand brushing against Rio’s arm.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Her eyes—intense and unyielding—locked onto Rio’s, and the air between them felt charged, as though every unsaid word from their arguments lingered in the space, waiting to tip the scales.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “You don’t actually hate me,” Agatha murmured, her voice low and teasing but somehow serious.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio tried to scoff, but the words wouldn’t come. Her throat felt dry. “You don’t know me,” she managed, though the conviction was missing.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She could feel her pulse quickening, her skin warming under Agatha’s gaze.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha stepped closer, closing the gap between them. “Oh, but I do,” she said, her voice almost a whisper now. “I know you better than you think.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      And then Agatha reached out, her fingers brushing against Rio’s cheek, her touch impossibly soft.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Before Rio could protest—or even think—Agatha leaned in.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      The kiss was slow and deliberate, and it shouldn’t have felt as good as it did. It shouldn’t have sent sparks shooting down Rio’s spine or made her knees weak.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      But it did.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      When Rio pulled back, her breath uneven, Agatha just looked at her with that infuriating smirk.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “See?” she said softly. “I told you.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She grabbed the collar of Agatha's coat and pulled her closer to her. She kissed her again, more forcefully this time, with an open mouth.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She sank her teeth into her bottom lip, drawing blood, and smiled.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She kissed her until her whole body sang with heat. She kissed her until they were both breathless.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      When they broke free, she could still feel Agatha's smile on her lips.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She felt Agatha's fingers trail lower and lower, her fingertips precise, causing sparks through her body.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio guided Agatha's hand between her legs. When —finally— those fingers moved beneath the layers of fabric, to where she so desperately craved them, Rio gasped into Agatha's warm mouth.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She knew her panties were helplessly ruined, she was so,
     </em>
     so
     <em>
      wet.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She knew that Agatha was aware of the effect she was having on Rio by the way her eyebrow raised and the way an approving sound left her lips, those lips that—
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio jolted awake.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart was pounding, her skin still tingling with the phantom sensation of Agatha’s touch.
    </p>
<p>
     She sat up, running a hand through her hair.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the hell was that?” she muttered. The dream clung to her, vivid and unsettling, and as much as she wanted to shake it off, she couldn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t real, she told herself. It didn’t mean anything.
    </p>
<p>
     She still hated Agatha, she did.
    </p>
<p>
     It was already taking enough out of Rio to tolerate her presence in her daily life (let alone pretend that it was truly bothering her).
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The next day, Agatha walked through PurpleBooks with Billy, though her thoughts were elsewhere.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy tried to keep the conversation going. "You know," he said, gesturing vaguely at the romance section, “underneath that disagreeable exterior, she could turn out to be—”
    </p>
<p>
     “A real bitch,” Agatha interrupted curtly, her voice flat as she stopped in front of a new display for memoirs. Her tone made it clear she wasn’t in the mood for a discussion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s not talk about it, Billy. I’m going back to the office. You must have work to do.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy, unperturbed, arched an eyebrow. “Not really. This place is humming like a top. Besides, I think you need the company more than I need a project.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and crossed her arms, trying to appear disinterested, though a flicker of discomfort crossed her face. Billy smirked. “How do you feel, are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave him a withering look. “I’m totally fine. I just... have things on my mind.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, and I’m a minimalist,” Billy quipped. He leaned casually against a display table.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s expression didn’t change, but she stiffened slightly. “It’s not about her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh-huh.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line. Billy seized the moment. “Come on, don’t clam up. You’re the one who always says a problem shared is a problem halved.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not a problem,” Agatha snapped, then immediately softened, as though regretting her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s just… strange. How can I reconcile these two versions of her that I know? And how will she ever be able to do that with me? Billy, she
     <em>
      loathes
     </em>
     me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy nodded, his expression thoughtful. “You’re both the same people. You just have to sit with this knowledge, as does she. Therefore, of course, she first needs to
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     this knowledge..”
    </p>
<p>
     “But-” Agatha interrupted quickly, trying to keep control of the conversation. But she had nothing to add.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy waited, letting the silence prod her.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s complicated,” Agatha admitted reluctantly, her voice quieter. “And I don’t know what to do with that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me know when you want to talk about it again,” Billy said lightly. “Until then, I’ll be over here pretending to organize the fantasy section.”
    </p>
<p>
     As he walked away, Agatha remained rooted to the spot.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Meanwhile, around the corner from the bookstore, Rio was walking toward the shop where Alice was waiting for her. Alice could immediately tell something was wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened?” Alice asked, concern in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “She never came,” Rio muttered, her frustration palpable.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, what the fuck? She stood you up?” Alice’s voice was sharp with disbelief.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think something happened—something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for her…” Rio trailed off, trying to make sense of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Just then, Jen walked in. “What happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She wasn’t able to make it,” Rio answered.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen’s expression shifted, processing the situation. “She stood you up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What could have happened?” Rio asked, her mind running through possible scenarios.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen looked stricken, clearly not sure how to respond.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio continued, “Why didn’t she come? Maybe she showed up, took one look at me, and left.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not possible,” Alice interjected.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe there was a subway accident,” Rio suggested, grasping for an explanation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Absolutely,” Alice agreed, caught up in the idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “A train was trapped underground with her inside,” Rio said, nodding to herself. “And no phone.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen still seemed shaken by the whole situation, her thoughts swirling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Or an automobile accident. Those cab drivers are maniacs,” Rio offered.
    </p>
<p>
     “They hit something, and you slam right into that plastic partition,” Alice added.
    </p>
<p>
     “Her elbows could be in splints so she can’t really text,” Rio said, trying to hold onto the hope that something, anything, could explain Agatha’s absence.
    </p>
<p>
     “Or she could be in the hospital, in one of those semi-private rooms with like—” Alice began.
    </p>
<p>
     “No phone,” they both said together.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen just shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen handed them a New York Post. They looked at the cover, their eyes widening as they read the headline: "
     <em>
      COPS NAB ROOFTOP KILLER."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stared at the paper, confused. “What are you saying?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It could be her,” Jen said.
    </p>
<p>
     Dead silence followed.
    </p>
<p>
     “She was arrested two blocks from the cheesecake place,” Jen continued, her voice filled with disbelief.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice quickly asked, “Is there a picture?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen nodded, and sure enough, there was a blurry image of a woman with a jacket pulled over her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice let out a soft breath. “So that explains it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She was in jail,” Jen confirmed, her tone almost detached.
    </p>
<p>
     “And there was a phone…” Alice started.
    </p>
<p>
     “…but she got only one call and had to use it to call her lawyer,” Jen finished.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice looked at Rio, almost in awe. “You are so lucky.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You could be dead,” Jen added, the weight of the situation hitting them all.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio snorted, “Are you crazy? This woman couldn’t possibly be the rooftop killer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How long did you sit there all alone?” Alice asked, narrowing her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not that long. Agatha Harkness came in—” Rio started. She felt her cheeks heat at the mention of her name after that dream.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha Harkness!” Alice exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to talk about it,” Rio replied, closing her eyes. “Let’s get to work.”
    </p>
<p>
     The shop was eerily quiet. There was no one else around, nothing to do. A long pause followed.
    </p>
<p>
     “There must be something to do. There’s always something to do,” Rio muttered, trying to break the silence.
    </p>
<p>
     Just then, the sound of the door jingle echoed through the store. They all looked up, hope flickering in their eyes, but it was only Lilia walking in.
    </p>
<p>
     “She stood her up,” Alice said quietly.

<p>
     Later that night, Rio sat at her desk, the weight of disappointment settling into her bones as she stared at her screen.
    </p>
<p>
     She had never been good at waiting. Not for anything, and certainly not for people.
    </p>
<p>
     The silence felt heavier than it should, and Rio found herself staring at the blinking cursor, unable to shake the sense of being ignored.
    </p>
<p>
     She exhaled a sharp breath, eyes burning with frustration, before she began typing an email.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’ve been thinking about you,”
     </em>
     she wrote.
    </p>
<p>
     She felt an odd mix of anger and sadness, a swirl of emotions she couldn’t quite untangle.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Last night, I went to meet you. And you weren’t there. I can’t even explain how foolish I felt.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I’ve been sitting here, rationalizing everything, trying to convince myself that there must be a good reason. I hope you have one.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She paused for a moment, the words lingering in the air.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “However, as I waited, someone else showed up—a woman who has made my professional life a misery—and an amazing thing happened. I was able, for the first time in my life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      And of course, afterwards, I felt terrible. Just as you said I would. She didn't deserve that.”
     </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
     In Agatha’s apartment, the email from the Green Witch—
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     —remained open on her laptop screen, the words stark and unyielding.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha read it again, slower this time, each sentence a gentle blow to her composure.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned back in her chair, the weight of realization pressing on her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     How had she not seen it before?
    </p>
<p>
     The sharp wit, the hidden kindness, the flashes of vulnerability that had so often slipped through their conversations—it all made so much sense now.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood abruptly, walking to the kitchen as if motion might clear the fog in her mind. She opened the refrigerator, stared at its contents for a moment, then closed it again.
    </p>
<p>
     Restlessness gnawed at her. She wandered through the apartment aimlessly, her thoughts looping back to the email no matter how much she tried to avoid it.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she returned to her laptop.
    </p>
<p>
     The screen still glowed, waiting. She sat down and placed her fingers on the keyboard, hesitating.
    </p>
<p>
     What could she possibly say?
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I am in Vancouver,”
     </em>
     she typed impulsively, but then frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     She deleted the sentence and tried again.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn’t get out of,”
     </em>
     she wrote.
     <em>
      “....and my phone died.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She stared at the words for a long moment, feeling the insincerity in them. They wouldn’t do.
    </p>
<p>
     With a grimace, she hit backspace, erasing the sentence letter by letter.
    </p>
<p>
     She typed and erased a dozen variations, each one worse than the last.
    </p>
<p>
     Excuses piled up and dissolved in front of her, none of them fitting the enormity of what she wanted to say.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she exhaled and began again, slower this time.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Dear Green,”
     </em>
     she wrote, her fingers trembling slightly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I cannot tell you what happened to me last night, but I beg you from the bottom of my heart to forgive me.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I feel terrible that you found yourself in a situation that caused you additional pain.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      But I’m absolutely sure that whatever you said last night was provoked—perhaps even deserved.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She stopped, her hands frozen over the keyboard. Her chest ached.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Soon I’ll explain everything,”
     </em>
     she added, the words carrying a quiet promise.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Meanwhile, I’m still here. Talk to me.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sat back in her chair, her pulse loud in her ears. She read the message over and over, her thoughts circling back to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Those deep, searching eyes, that sleek cascade of dark hair, the quiet intensity.
    </p>
<p>
     The thought of her now felt strange—so close yet so impossibly out of reach.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pressed her palms to her face, groaning softly. If only she’d known sooner.
    </p>
<p>
     If only she’d realized who Rio was years ago, when they had started writing to each other, spilling secrets and baring their souls.
    </p>
<p>
     She would have tried harder, later on.
    </p>
<p>
     Shaking her head, she closed the laptop gently. As she stood and stared out the window into the city below, one thought anchored her amidst the chaos of her emotions.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't going to give up—not yet. But
     <em>
      how
     </em>
     , that was the question.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The following day, Rio and Alice walked side by side down the street, their pace casual but their thoughts clearly preoccupied.
    </p>
<p>
     The silence between them stretched for a while before Alice glanced over, her curiosity finally getting the better of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did she say anything about meeting again?” Alice asked, her tone light but probing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged, stuffing her hands into her coat pockets.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not really. It doesn’t matter,” she said, but she knew her voice carried a faint edge of disappointment.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice raised an eyebrow but didn’t press.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, however, couldn’t help but turn over DTWR’s words from their last conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been something distant about them, like a subtle closing of the door. It wasn’t cold, but it was cautious, and that hesitation lingered in Rio’s mind like a shadow.
    </p>
<p>
     She wondered if DTWR would ever really want to meet again.
    </p>
<p>
     Or if this was it. A single moment of revelation, forever unfinished.
    </p>
<p>
     Would she hold her at arm’s length now, unwilling or unable to bridge the gap?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to dismiss the thought as logical, understandable even.
    </p>
<p>
     But still...
    </p>
<p>
     The idea of it never happening—never turning into something real—felt unbearably sad. It would leave everything between them in this untouchable, half-formed space.
    </p>
<p>
     A collection of words and feelings, but nothing tangible to anchor them.
    </p>
<p>
     It would always feel like something Rio had conjured out of her own imagination, as if DTWR had only ever existed in her mind and not the world.
    </p>
<p>
     She sighed softly, her gaze on the pavement as they walked.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice noticed but didn’t push further, giving Rio the space to wrestle with her thoughts.

      The closure of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Shop Around the Corner
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      loomed over Rio like a thundercloud. She had known it was inevitable for weeks now, maybe even months.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Capitalism was real—a shadow she’d loved to rail against, a system she’d long mocked in her clever tirades. But she hadn’t been ready for it to land so squarely on her doorstep, to uproot her own life so directly and personally.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And now? What could she do? Another public stunt? Beg Agatha for help? Plead for some compromise?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No. She wouldn’t.

<p>
<span>
      It was settled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That certainty didn’t make the closing any less devastating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If anything, it made it worse. It wasn’t just heartbreak—it was a gnawing, blistering frustration. Her fingers twitched in restless defiance, her thoughts spiraling as she asked herself over and over:
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       How could something so important, so all-consuming, be ripped away like this?
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had poured her entire life into the shop, and now it was slipping through her fingers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t fair. None of it was fair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat slumped on the worn loveseat in Lilia’s West Side apartment, the tea-scented air doing little to soothe her. A platter of cookies sat untouched between them, an offering that felt futile in the face of what she was losing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The weight of the moment pressed on her chest like a stone. The voices of her friends were a low hum in the background, words blurred together by the fog in her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio,” Lilia said softly, breaking through at last. Her voice was gentle but firm, an anchor in the chaos. “It’s okay, dearie.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio barely registered the words. Her gaze remained fixed on some indeterminate point in the distance as she muttered, her voice flat and distant, “I can’t believe we’re going to close.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice, seated on the other side of the couch, echoed grimly, “Close.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The word hung in the air, heavy and final. For a moment, it felt as though it was the only word in the world.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It feels like such a failure,” Rio murmured, sinking further into the cushions. Her shoulders slumped as if the weight of the word itself had pressed her deeper into the fabric.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia slid closer, wrapping an arm around her. The embrace was warm and steady, the kind of comfort that asked for nothing in return.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio didn’t resist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead, she closed her eyes and leaned into the touch, letting herself be held just for a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But even in Lilia’s arms, the sting of failure lingered, sharper now in its contrast to the fleeting sense of safety. It hurt to be consoled. It hurt even more to know how much she needed it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice finally broke the silence, her tone tinged with frustration. “It’s not a failure, Rio. You fought like hell for that shop. It’s not your fault this city makes it impossible for places like ours to survive.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio opened her eyes but said nothing, the words striking too close to the truth she didn’t want to confront.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It doesn’t feel that way,” she said at last. “It feels like I wasn’t good enough. Like I didn’t fight hard enough.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia gave her a soft squeeze. “You gave it everything, Rio. Everything. Some battles are just too big, even for the fiercest of warriors.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a bitter laugh. “Right. Me, a warrior.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice leaned forward, her eyes bright with determination. “You’re allowed to grieve, okay? You’re allowed to feel all of it. But don’t you dare let this make you think you’re not good enough. You’re brilliant, Rio. Anyone who’s ever stepped into that shop knows it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For a fleeting moment, Rio felt the tiniest spark of comfort in their words. But it was quickly snuffed out by the overwhelming tide of loss. She wasn’t ready to believe them—not yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead, she closed her eyes again and let herself sink into the solace of Lilia’s embrace, the sound of her friends’ voices a fragile lifeline in the storm.
     </span>

      At
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Shop Around the Corner
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , a week later, a sign in the window declared in bold, bittersweet letters:
     </span>
<b>
      CLOSING THIS WEEK: EVERYTHING 40% OFF.
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The cozy, intimate haven Rio had nurtured for years now buzzed with a kind of energy that felt foreign—chaotic and transactional.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Customers combed through the shelves with an almost predatory fervor, snatching up books in towering stacks, stripping the store of its character with every purchase. What was once a sanctuary for book lovers now felt more like a feeding frenzy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood behind the cash register, her hands moving on autopilot as she rang up sales. The rhythmic
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       beep
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      of the scanner was a cruel metronome to the unraveling of her dream. Conversations swirled around her, their tones cheerful, practical, or sharp, but each one landed differently in her ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia spoke about her plans to travel the world. Her voice carried over the din like a bright, steady note, but it only made Rio’s chest ache.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice mentioned dusting off her dissertation, finally giving herself the push to finish it. Rio was proud of her, but it was a reminder that even her closest allies were already moving on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then there was Jen. She leaned against the counter, arms crossed, her words barbed with bitterness. “Got a job offer from PurpleBooks,” she said flatly, her voice dripping with disdain. “Like hell I’d work there.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s stomach twisted. She wanted to tell Jen to let it go, that they were better than this. But the venom in Jen’s words echoed her own feelings too well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The anger she wasn’t allowing herself to feel—the betrayal, the injustice—it all came rushing to the surface.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead of responding, Rio focused on the monotonous task at hand. The register drawer opened and closed, books disappeared into bags, and customers left with what felt like pieces of her soul.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With each transaction, she felt another thread of her life slipping away. Every familiar face in the crowd, every hand that handed her cash or a card, was a reminder of what she was losing. These people weren’t just customers; they were her community, her extended family. And yet, today, they felt like strangers, taking what they could from a place that wouldn’t exist tomorrow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A customer lingered at the counter, trying to make small talk about how much they’d miss the shop. Rio managed a polite smile, murmuring, “Thank you,” but her voice sounded far away, even to herself. The sentiment might have been genuine, but it didn’t make it easier to swallow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When the customer finally left, Rio exhaled, gripping the edge of the counter for support. She glanced around at the shelves, now more bare than full, and it hit her again like a punch to the gut.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This wasn’t just a store. It was her life. And soon, it would be gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice approached, gently placing a hand on Rio’s arm. “You okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, her smile tight. “Yeah. Just a few more days, right?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the afternoon wore on, Rio felt the hours stretching unbearably long. The shop was fading before her eyes, and there was nothing she could do to stop it. Every book that left the store was another reminder that soon, there would be nothing left of the life she’d built.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By the time the crowd thinned out and the sun began to dip below the horizon, the shop felt emptier than ever. Rio stood behind the counter, staring at the sign in the window. The words seemed to mock her now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She took a deep breath and turned away, focusing instead on the few remaining books on the nearest shelf. For now, she could still pretend this place was hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That night, Rio walked aimlessly through the city streets, the frigid air biting at her skin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stopped in front of the glowing windows of PurpleBooks Superstore. The store was bustling, packed with people who browsed without a care, unaware of what was being lost just a few blocks away. Her heart clenched.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She pressed her lips together and stepped inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The children’s section was massive, almost overwhelming. Tiny chairs surrounded a sprawling stage, and shelves overflowed with vibrant books that promised wonder and adventure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The sight of it all made her stomach churn.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lowered herself into one of the child-sized chairs, her energy draining entirely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her shop, her haven, was closing. Meanwhile, this… monstrosity thrived.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you have the
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Shoe
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      books?” a woman asked a salesperson nearby.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The salesperson looked lost. “The
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Shoe
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      books? Who’s the author?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My friend said my daughter has to read them,” the woman replied. “So here I am.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t hold back. “Noel Streatfeild,” she said, her voice cutting through the conversation. “Noel Streatfeild wrote

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her voice cracked on the last word, and her throat tightened. She had spoken those words countless times in her store, helping parents and children discover the magic of books.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But this time, it felt hollow, like an echo of what she had been.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The salesperson blinked at her. “How do you spell that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-I-L-D,” Rio said, her patience thin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The woman offered a quick “thank you” before moving on, leaving Rio muttering under her breath, “They know nothing. Not a fucking thing.”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      The PurpleBooks superstore buzzed with the easy hum of efficiency—cashiers ringing up purchases, customers meandering the aisles with baskets of glossy bestsellers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wandered aimlessly, her heels clicking softly against the polished floor. Her thoughts were elsewhere until she turned a corner and froze.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There, in the children’s section, was Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ducked behind a towering endcap, her pulse quickening. She peeked around the edge, her breath catching. Rio sat slumped in a tiny chair near a colorful display of picture books, her posture heavy with something Agatha couldn’t quite name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked... small. Not just physically, in that tiny chair, but emotionally. Her usual sharpness and confidence were absent, replaced by a quiet, aching sadness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn’t tear her eyes away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s hands fidgeted in her lap, her gaze unfocused as if she were lost in thought. Agatha’s chest tightened at the sight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This was not the woman she sparred with, not the one who met her jabs with a biting wit of her own. This was someone else—someone raw and wounded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For a moment, Agatha considered walking over. But she shoved the impulse down quickly. What would she even say?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What right did she have to offer comfort when she was the reason Rio was hurting in the first place?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Still, the thought lingered, persistent. She wanted to apologize, to explain, to—what? Tell her everything? That she’d been DTWR all along? The idea sent a ripple of panic through her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned against the endcap, her mind spinning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What would Rio do if she looked up and saw her standing there? Would she storm off in anger?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Or worse—would she look at her with the same defeated expression she wore now? Agatha wasn’t sure she could handle that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And yet, she didn’t leave.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stayed there, watching as Rio helped a customer find a book. The exchange was brief, polite, but Agatha caught the flicker of pain in Rio’s eyes. Even in this unfamiliar setting, she was still Rio—thoughtful, attentive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She clenched her fists, her nails biting into her palms. She hated this feeling—this gnawing guilt, this stupid, useless longing. She had never been good at vulnerability, and seeing Rio like this only made her own defenses feel more fragile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After what felt like an eternity, Agatha pushed herself off the shelf and turned to leave. Her steps were quick, almost hurried, as if putting distance between herself and Rio might quiet the tumult in her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Back in her office, Agatha sat at her computer, the screen glaring at her. An email draft sat unfinished. The cursor blinked tauntingly after just two words: “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I’m sorry.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stared at them, chewing on the edge of her thumbnail. It was trite, useless, but what else could she say?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She backspaced furiously and started again: “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say. Truly I don’t. And anything I do say will sound trite. I hope you feel better.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stared at the screen, appalled by the emptiness of her words. It wasn’t enough.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Hours later, Agatha sat in the lobby of her building, waiting for the elevator with Herb.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So,” Herb said, his voice casual, “I was thinking—Rio Vidal would probably make a great children’s book advisor.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s head whipped toward him. “Why would you think that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Herb shrugged. “She knows everything. She has flawless taste. Salesmen swear by her. If she likes a book, it sells. Period.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted, the sound bitter. “So you’re going to offer her a job?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why not? What else does she have to do now?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The elevator doors slid open, and they stepped inside.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s not going to work for us,” Agatha said, her voice low.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why not?” Herb asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because,” Agatha replied sharply, “She would never want to. Plus, she has a horrible personality. She’s… nice to everyone all the time. It’s exhausting.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Herb raised an eyebrow. “Nice is horrible?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And her staff turnover is nonexistent. They’ve been with her forever.” Agatha’s tone dripped with sarcasm. “Until recently, of course.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thanks to us,” Herb reminded her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t respond. The elevator doors slid shut, leaving the unspoken tension hanging in the air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Herb cleared his throat. “I could send Jennifer Kale another reminder?”

     Rio poured hot water into her favorite tea mug, the one with a slightly chipped handle she couldn’t bear to part with.
    </p>
<p>
     Her apartment was quiet, save for the distant hum of city life beyond the windows. On her laptop, an unfinished email flickered softly, a few words staring back at her like ghosts.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I wonder whether change isn't a kind of infection,”
     </em>
     she had typed. “
     <em>
      You start with one thing—something you never thought would change—and it does…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She hesitated, her hands hovering over the keys.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “My store is officially closing this week. I own a bookstore. Did I ever tell you that? Probably not.  It's a lovely store…
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     The tea forgotten, Rio moved to her bedroom, hoping the familiarity of her space would soothe her. She climbed into bed, pulling the comforter up tightly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Soon we'll just be a memory. In fact, some foolish person will probably think it's a tribute to this city, the way it keeps changing on you, the way you can never count on it, or something.  I know, because that's the sort of thing I'm always saying.  But the truth is, I'm heartbroken.  I feel as if part of me has died, and no one can ever make it right.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Sleep evaded her, replaced by an ache that twisted and turned in the stillness of the night. She felt unmoored, as if every certainty she’d once held had been swept away.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The shop was almost bare now. Rio stood in the doorway of
     <em>
      The Shop Around the Corner
     </em>
     , her gaze fixed on the shelves that had once overflowed with stories waiting to be discovered. The bell above the door jingled as the last customer left, the sound bittersweet and final.
    </p>
<p>
     The small sign in the window read:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "After 42 years, we are closing our doors. Thank you for allowing us to be part of your lives."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio reached for the bell above the door frame, her fingers trembling slightly. She took it down, clutching it in her hand as she stepped outside.
    </p>
<p>
     Locking the door for the last time, she lowered the grate, the metallic groan echoing in the dusk. She stared through the bars, trying to commit every detail to memory—the warm yellow glow of the shop, the countless hours spent building something she believed in.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned away, the little bell jingling softly in her hand as she walked off into the night.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     At PurpleBooks, Jen sat in a tiny chair surrounded by her new staff in the children's section, a circle of adults perched awkwardly on pint-sized furniture. Her voice was animated, though her eyes revealed exhaustion.
    </p>
<p>
     She went for the job anyways—she needed the money, after all. And Rio had assured her it was okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then, in the 19th century,” Jen began, “Caldecott revolutionized the publishing of children’s books with the introduction of color illustrations…”
    </p>
<p>
     Around her, the staff nodded absently, some stifling yawns.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “Can we see the Storybook Lady again, mom?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha strolled past the Eleanor Roosevelt statue, the crisp air nipping at her cheeks. Nicky’s hand was in hers.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to ignore the pang in her chest at his suggestion.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew this moment had to come anyways, sooner or later.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about the Children’s Zoo?” she tried, her voice overly chipper.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to go to the zoo,” he muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay. The Staten Island Ferry?” she offered, trying to muster enthusiasm.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to see Rio,” Nicky repeated, his tone decisive and unyielding.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed. The name felt heavier every time she heard it. She adjusted her scarf as if it might shield her from the sting of his words.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can’t go to the Storybook Lady anymore,” she said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She had to close her store,” Agatha replied, trying to sound neutral, though guilt threatened to crack her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She didn’t have enough business,” she explained, avoiding his gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky’s persistence wasn’t just the curiosity of a child; it was sharp, unrelenting, a mirror reflecting everything she didn’t want to confront.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well,” she began, grasping for a way to explain it in terms that wouldn’t make her seem monstrous, “her store was very close to ours, and… our store sells books at a slightly lower cost.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s steps faltered, and she tightened her hold on his hand, as if anchoring herself. “So more people can buy books,” she said quickly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why couldn’t Rio do that too?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s small, and we’re big,” Agatha replied. Her voice sounded hollow, even to herself. “How about we go get some candy?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky stopped in his tracks, tugging his hand free from hers. His eyes were glassy as he stared up at her. “So now she’s gone. And it’s all your fault.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words hit Agatha like a blow. She opened her mouth to respond but found herself at a loss.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s business, Nicky,” she said at last, her voice quieter now. “It’s not personal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Not personal. She repeated the words in her head, as if saying them enough would make them true.
    </p>
<p>
     But wasn’t it?
    </p>
<p>
     She thought of Rio’s face—soft, expressive, and kind—lit up by the warmth of her store. She thought of the way Rio spoke about books, with reverence and love, as though they were living things.
    </p>
<p>
     She thought about how she’d been replaying Rio’s voice in her mind lately, unbidden, as if she missed it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Personal,” Nicky said, his voice trembling with conviction, “means she’s gone forever. And now we’ll never get another book from her as long as we live.”
    </p>
<p>
     His tears came fast now, raw and unfiltered. Agatha crouched down, her hands on his shoulders. She wanted to comfort him, to say something that would make him stop crying.
    </p>
<p>
     But Nicky wasn’t wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     Hadn’t she done the very thing she hated most—turned something good and pure into a casualty of strategy?
    </p>
<p>
     She thought of Rio standing in her empty shop, in her dark coat, locking the door for the last time. It broke something within her.
    </p>
<p>
     And now here was Nicky, summing up her guilt with childlike precision.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hired Jen,” she said suddenly, grasping for a lifeline. “Remember Jen? The woman who worked with her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky sniffled, his face scrunched in misery. “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well,” Agatha pressed, “I hired her. She’s working with us now.”
    </p>
<p>
     But instead of softening, his expression hardened.
    </p>
<p>
     “You killed the Storybook Lady,” Nicky said, his voice steady and devastating. “And then you took her friends.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze, her knees still bent, her hands slipping off his shoulders. She straightened slowly, her chest tight and aching.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked down at her son—her clever, sharp-eyed little boy—and for once, she had no argument to offer.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     In PurpleBooks’ children’s section, Jen now wore the pointed hat that Rio once wore, the one that had transformed her into the beloved Storybook Lady. A sign behind her read:
     <em>
      Ms. Storybook
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     She read aloud to a cluster of children seated cross-legged at her feet. The children listened intently, their eyes wide with wonder.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky sat off to the side, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. He glowered at Jen, his expression a mixture of betrayal and frustration.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t the same.
    </p>
<p>
     And he wasn’t ready to forgive anyone who pretended it could be.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Agatha paced the sleek, sterile hallway of PurpleBooks, the hum of the fluorescent lights above her the only sound in the quiet after-hours.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky’s words echoed in her mind, a constant refrain that she couldn’t shake.
    </p>
<p>
     She was thinking, perhaps for the first time, about doing the unthinkable: finding a way to help Rio, to salvage her store after all.
    </p>
<p>
     Not in the way Rio would have hoped, or even in a way she herself might have envisioned. But in a way that could ease the pain, even if just a little.
    </p>
<p>
     She had dismissed these ideas before, telling herself that she had acted on principle, that the decision had been made for the sake of business.
    </p>
<p>
     The numbers hadn’t lied.
    </p>
<p>
     And, as she’d always believed, favoritism wasn’t just dangerous—it was borderline illegal. Not that she usually cared too much about that. Still, if she entertained the idea of bringing back
     <em>
      The Shop Around The Corner
     </em>
     , it had to be done cautiously.
    </p>
<p>
     But now, she couldn’t help but consider her options.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe the children’s department at PurpleBooks could take over the space? It seemed logical—after all, they could use more room.
    </p>
<p>
     But then again, would that just feel like a slap in the face to Rio?
    </p>
<p>
     Would it be insulting, a gesture made out of pity rather than genuine effort to right the wrong?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped in front of the large glass window, staring out at the city below. The sun was setting, casting golden hues across the skyline, and for a moment, the vastness of the city made everything feel small, distant.
    </p>
<p>
     But inside her, the weight of her choices felt suffocating.
    </p>
<p>
     She longed to fix everything. Fix Rio’s heartache, fix her own guilt, fix the things she had messed up through Nicky's eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     But was that even possible? What was the right thing to do?
    </p>
<p>
     She had to balance many: her duty to her business and her responsibility as a leader, as well as the undeniable pull of her feelings.
    </p>
<p>
     Because, for the first time, she couldn’t ignore the latter anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingers hovered over the paperwork on her desk, the weight of it pressing down on her. The possibilities felt like small comfort, but could they really be enough to make things right? Agatha wasn’t sure yet.
    </p>
<p>
     But for the first time, the idea of making a move, of offering a solution, felt more tangible than it ever had before.

<span>
      Rio lay curled up in bed, buried under a mountain of blankets, a parade of tissues scattered around her like confetti. The room was dim, the air thick with the smell of Vicks vapor rub and the gentle hum of her Joni Mitchell record spinning lazily on the turntable. The soothing chords of "A Case of You" should’ve been a balm for her soul, but instead, the lyrics only made her ache more. She wasn’t sure what for—everything felt heavy, swollen with feelings that she couldn’t put into words.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone buzzed. It was a message from DTWR.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       How is the cold?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio read it, then dropped her phone into the abyss of tissues beside her. Her throat hurt, her head hurt, but more than that—she was tired.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone lit up again:
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Are you feeling any better?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I’m lying in bed, listening to Joni Mitchell and drinking cranberry juice, which I’m sorry to say is the exact same color as my nose. I keep thinking about my future. What future? What am I going to do?
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha perched at the foot of Nicky’s bed, her hands clasped in her lap. The room was bathed in the soft glow of his bedside lamp, casting long shadows on the walls. She let out a slow breath, her voice quieter than usual. “You’re still mad, huh?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky didn’t respond immediately, but his crossed arms and the stubborn tilt of his chin spoke volumes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Finally, he broke the silence, his tone sharp. “Yes, of course.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She sighed—he was his mother’s son, alright.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But…”, his change in tone made her look up attentively. “I might forgive you... if you admit you like her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha blinked, the words hitting like a bucket of ice water. For a moment, she wasn’t sure if she’d heard him right. “Like who?” she asked cautiously, stalling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      His face broke into a grin, and she felt her stomach drop. “You know who.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her jaw tightened. There was no way he could know—no way anyone could know.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She’d barely admitted it to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But Nicky was undeterred, listing his evidence on his fingers like a tiny detective.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “When you met her, you blushed. I remember, because I didn’t even think you
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       could
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      blush. Then, in the supermarket, you stuck up for her and helped her, even though you didn’t have to. And, third—” he held up three fingers for emphasis—“you only tease people you like. Like me, or Billy. Or Sharon, when she doesn’t bring that gross casserole.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tried to keep a neutral expression, but he wasn’t finished. “So I thought maybe you don’t know you like her. Or”—he squinted, clearly trying to piece it together—“you’re ignoring it because you’re too chicken. Probably.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stared at him, utterly dumbfounded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He was only eight, and somehow, he saw straight through her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn’t decide if she was horrified or proud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky,” she began, but he cut her off, his arms still folded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What? Is it ‘complicated’? It’s always ‘complicated.’”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He rolled his eyes, mimicking her usual tone so perfectly it stung. “Come on, Mom. You like her!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed, a lump forming in her throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re too smart for your own good, you know that?” she muttered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She cleared her throat, steeling herself. “And... you’re right. I do like her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky made a triumphant noise, something between a laugh and a satisfied hum. “Duh,” he said, as if the entire situation had been obvious to anyone with eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But it’s not that simple.” Agatha’s voice softened, and she stared down at her hands. “She probably hates me. Wouldn’t you hate someone who... I don’t know... ruined your life?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky frowned, his triumphant grin fading. “Yeah, maybe. But people are complicated, right? You’re the one who told me that. You just have to explain yourself. And maybe you can fix it!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not that easy,” she muttered, rubbing her temples. “I want to be there for her… But I don’t think she’d let me. Besides, she is feeling sick right now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky’s eyes lit up. “Then go over! I can call Sharon. She loves babysitting me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, though it came out more like a strangled choke. “You’re really not going to let this go, are you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nope,” he said confidently. Then his expression softened, and he reached out, wrapping his arms around her. “I love you, Mom. I just want you to be happy.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt tears sting her eyes. She hugged him back tightly, resting her chin on his head. “I love you too, Nicky. So much.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good. Now go call Sharon,” he mumbled against her stomach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed through her tears. Maybe he was right.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe she just had to take the leap.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hovered just outside Rio’s apartment building, clutching a bouquet of daisies in her grip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, as The Green Witch, had once mentioned that daisies were her favorite flowers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At the time, Agatha had found it an amusing contradiction—such bright, unassuming blooms favored by someone so enigmatic and layered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But knowing Rio now—the layers of complexity just underneath a quiet, unguarded beauty—it made perfect sense.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The night was colder than she’d anticipated; a sharp breeze slipped through her coat and bit at her cheeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She’d gotten Rio’s address from Billy after an almost comical amount of dodging and indirectness. His arched brow and sly smile had made her cheeks flush, but she’d deflected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Of course, she hadn’t explained why she needed it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And now that she stood here, not far from her own neighborhood, the proximity made her feel absurd.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What was she even doing? Her internal monologue had been relentless the entire walk over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Showing up unannounced, daisies in hand—it was impulsive, borderline foolish. She could have just sent some more texts as DTWR and left things at that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But the idea of doing so had felt insufficient.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A message on a screen didn’t match the churning, complicated mess of feelings that had propelled her here.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She needed to see Rio. As Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her gaze settled on the buzzer panel beside the door:
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Vidal, 3A
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . She pressed the button before she could talk herself out of it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A sharp buzz broke the silence, but nothing followed. She pressed it again. The sound echoed in the empty street, her nerves prickling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Finally, a voice crackled through the intercom. Muffled, groggy, and congested. “Who is it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat. “It’s… Agatha,” she replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The silence stretched.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood at the intercom, her fingers hovering over the button as she blinked away the fog of sleep and sickness. Her head throbbed, her throat ached, and her thoughts felt like they were moving through molasses. The voice on the intercom had been unmistakable, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . What the hell was she doing here?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even in her haze, Rio could feel the sharp jolt of confusion threading through her grogginess.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What are you doing here?” she rasped into the intercom, her voice hoarse and muffled by congestion. It sounded more defensive than she’d intended, but maybe that was for the best.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “May I please come up?” Agatha’s voice, smooth and deliberate, held its usual blend of politeness and steely resolve. But there was something else there too—a vulnerability that Rio couldn’t quite place.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why?” Rio shot back, her suspicion evident. She pressed her forehead to the cool wall beside the intercom, her body heavy with exhaustion. Agatha was the last person she’d expected to deal with tonight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before she could receive an answer, the buzz of the building’s door cut through the night air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Someone was leaving, and Rio realized too late that the silence meant that Agatha had taken the opportunity to slip inside. Great.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By the time Rio shuffled back to her apartment door, she could hear the distinct sound of footsteps ascending the stairs. Agatha’s footsteps. She didn’t have the energy to process the swirl of emotions rising in her chest—annoyance, confusion, and an odd twinge of… nerves.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She unlocked the door, and when Agatha appeared in the doorway, clutching a bouquet of daisies, she didn’t look like the sharp-edged woman Rio had come to associate with impersonal efficiency.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her posture was almost tentative, and the flowers in her hand seemed absurdly out of place, like a painting hung in the wrong gallery.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have a cold,” Rio croaked, leaning against the door frame. “So maybe come some other time?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t flinch. Instead, she stepped inside without invitation, moving with a calm, quiet determination that left Rio too stunned to react.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not going anywhere,” Agatha said simply, her voice gentle but firm. And for some reason, Rio felt her chest tighten.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ve got some fucking nerve,” Rio muttered, though the edge in her tone had dulled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wasn’t sure if it was the fever or Agatha’s strange, disarming presence that was throwing her off. She felt paralyzed, her usual cynicism melting under the weight of something unfamiliar.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha extended the daisies, a faint, self-aware smile playing on her lips. “I brought you flowers,” she said, as though that explained everything. Not just flowers—Agatha had brought her
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       daisies.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She pushed that thought away for now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead, Rio snorted, taking the bouquet with an exaggerated sigh. “Right. Thanks for the daisy-shaped guilt trip. Did you come here to offer me a job, too? Maybe a spot running your coffee counter?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t bite back. Instead, she moved toward the kitchen with an ease that startled Rio, as if she belonged there. Rio trailed after her, both intrigued and exasperated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry,” Rio cringed. “That was uncalled for.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wanted to be angry, to kick Agatha out, but the truth was she didn’t have the energy to push her away. And also—she didn’t really want to, somehow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sit,” Agatha instructed, pulling out a chair at the kitchen table. Rio hesitated but finally dropped into it with a huff. Agatha moved about the kitchen, searching for a vase, her movements unhurried.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched her, feeling oddly mesmerized.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re being nice,” she said quietly, her voice tinged with suspicion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to her, vase in hand. “Because I’ve been horrible,” she replied, her tone matter-of-fact but sincere.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She laughed softly, and for the first time, Rio thought she caught a glimpse of something unguarded in her expression.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wondered briefly if she was in another dream about Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The weight of her cold—and the day—finally bore down on her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio dragged herself off the couch and toward her bedroom. “Look, I’m too sick for whatever this is. I’m going to bed.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And Agatha did follow, hovering at the edge of the room as Rio collapsed onto the bed. The daisies appeared again, placed carefully on the nightstand. Agatha lingered, her gaze heavy with something Rio couldn’t quite name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I hope you feel better soon,” Agatha said softly, her voice devoid of its usual sharpness. It was so... un-Agatha-like that Rio didn’t know how to respond.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thanks,” she mumbled, pulling the blankets up to her chin. Her cheeks felt warm, though whether it was the fever or Agatha’s unexpected kindness, she couldn’t tell.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love daisies”, she then added, murmuring.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha lingered a moment longer before stepping back. “I know,” she said quietly, her tone leaving a strange ache in Rio’s chest. “Take care, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then she was gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before Rio could untangle the threads of her thoughts, sleep pulled her under. The click of the front door echoed faintly through the apartment.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      It was two days later, and Rio felt much better.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rain pattered softly against the windows, its rhythm steady and soothing, as she sat cross-legged on her bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her laptop rested precariously on her knees, its screen illuminating her face in the dim room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A blank page stared back at her, expectant, but her mind felt like a jumble of static, inspiration flitting just out of reach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her gaze wandered around the room, half-seeking a spark of creativity, until it landed on the daisies perched on her desk. The flowers, cheerful and steadfast, seemed to glow against the stormy gray light.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hesitated, then let her fingers drift to the keyboard, almost moving on their own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       It began with a woman who built her walls so high, they seemed impenetrable. People feared her sharp edges, mistaking her strength for hostility and her silence for indifference. But beneath, she was more than just a wall—more than the cold, unyielding façade she presented to the world. Her name was… Agnes.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words came in a quiet rush, the story beginning to unfurl, soft yet vivid. The rhythm of writing filled the room, smoothing the jagged edges of Rio’s thoughts. She barely noticed the passage of time until she paused, staring at the half-finished page before her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But the comfort of the words didn’t last.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned back against the headboard, closing her eyes. The memory of last night resurfaced —Agatha standing at her door, holding the daisies like some peace offering. Rio had been sick, too out of it to fully understand what was happening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She tried to untangle it now, replaying the moments. Agatha had been polite, almost painfully so. Was it guilt driving her kindness? Some desperate attempt to absolve herself, to wash her hands of the damage she’d done?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hated the thought. She wasn’t a pawn, wasn’t someone who could be bought with flowers and niceties.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And yet... something in Agatha’s demeanor had felt sincere. There had been a flicker in her eyes, a tone in her voice—it was maddening to think about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn’t trust her memory, fogged as it was by fever and exhaustion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Had she imagined it all, conjured meaning where there was none?
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat at her desk, the glow of her laptop illuminating the faint furrow in her brow. A pencil loosely holding up her hair, forgotten, while a mug of tea stood sentinel at her elbow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Outside, the rain tapped a steady rhythm against the window, a subtle counterpoint to the tapping of her fingers on the keys.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “You know, I still think that we should meet. And we will. But, as of right now, I’m in the middle of a project that needs…”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She paused, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. Her eyes narrowed, searching for the right word. “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       ...tweaking.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha frowned, rereading the line as her chest tightened with doubt. It was clinical, dismissive—everything Rio hated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And she knew it. The words didn’t feel right, but they were the best she could manage.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was searching for a way to untangle it all—to bridge the gap without seeming weak, to chip away at Rio’s defenses without provoking her ire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      To make Rio forget her hatred.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then, she could take the next step.
     </span>

<div>
<p>
     Through the wide glass window, Rio sat alone, cradling a coffee between her hands, her favorite hoodie pulled snug around her. Her tote bag hung lazily over the back of her chair.
    </p>
<p>
     She was lost in her own world until the door chimed, pulling her back into reality.
    </p>
<p>
     And there she was, the woman who lingered annoyingly on her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio immediately noticed her, because how could she not?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha always had a way of commanding a room, even when she wasn’t trying.
    </p>
<p>
     Her dark curls fell messily over her shoulders, her eyes scanning the café with practiced indifference.
    </p>
<p>
     When their eyes met, Agatha’s lips curled into that signature, self-assured smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     She raised a hand in an exaggerated wave, her fingers wiggling playfully.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a slow breath, willing herself to stay calm, even as her chest tightened.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, fancy seeing you here,” Agatha said, sliding into the seat across from her without so much as a glance at the empty tables around them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze flicked up, unimpressed. “Is it, yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is. I am glad to see that you're feeling better”, she replied.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s jaw tightened.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel the familiar heat rising in her chest—the frustration, the resentment, the
     <em>
      confusion.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you care if I want to hang out with you or not?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised a brow, leaning forward just enough to close the distance between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who says I don’t?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio almost laughed, the sound sharp and bitter. “Well, personally, I wouldn’t try to cozy up to someone who hates me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s expression faltered for a moment, then she tilted her head, her voice light. “You
     <em>
      still
     </em>
     hate me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, come on, Agatha.” Rio set her cup down harder than she meant to, the soft clink of ceramic echoing between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “You literally ruined my life’s work. How could I not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did,” Agatha admitted, leaning back in her chair.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no longer any trace of smugness in her tone. “Indirectly, though. But you’re right. I’m not here to dismiss what you feel.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked, thrown off by the directness of her response. She expected deflection, sarcasm—anything but this.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingers twitched against the table, unsure what to do now that the usual rhythm of their arguments was broken.
    </p>
<p>
     Once again, Agatha was being
     <em>
      kind
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     “So why are you sitting at my table?” she asked, quieter this time.
    </p>
<p>
     The silence stretched long enough that Rio almost believed she wouldn’t answer.
    </p>
<p>
     But then: “I don’t know, Rio. Maybe I just want to be your friend. I’m not asking for forgiveness—just... your company.”
    </p>
<p>
     Friend. That word didn’t fit, not with the tangled mess of emotions Rio felt whenever Agatha was around.
    </p>
<p>
     Anger, sure. Resentment, absolutely. Sexual attraction, also yes, unfortunately.
    </p>
<p>
     But there was something else beneath it, something Rio didn’t want to name.
    </p>
<p>
     She hated how Agatha could make her feel so much, how her presence turned everything sharp and unsteady.
    </p>
<p>
     She should say no. She wanted to. But the words caught in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe it was the exhaustion of fighting, maybe it was the flicker of
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     in Agatha’s eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” she muttered, her voice begrudging. “Same time tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile returned. “I’ll be here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched her for a long moment, waiting for her to leave.
    </p>
<p>
     Even after Agatha stood and walked away, her heart kept pounding.
    </p>
<p>
     She stared down at her coffee, suddenly aware of how cold it had become.
    </p>
<p>
     What was she doing? And why did some part of her look forward to tomorrow?
    </p>
<p>
     And also, she realized now—Agatha never even ordered a drink.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
<em>
      Hi you, sup?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Alice’s message popped up just as Rio was pacing her living room.
    </p>
<p>
     She grabbed her phone and immediately called Alice, desperate for a second opinion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice… something weird is happening,” Rio blurted out, not even bothering with a greeting.
    </p>
<p>
     On the other end, Alice’s voice came through, slightly muffled but instantly alert.
    </p>
<p>
     “Weird? Is this about Ms. Pen Pal again?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no… not her. It’s—” Rio hesitated, as though saying the name aloud might solidify the strange reality she was grappling with.
    </p>
<p>
     “About Agatha Harkness, then?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt her cheeks heat.
     <em>
      How on earth…
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Alice was silent for a beat, and then her voice returned, brimming with suspicion. “Wait, did I guess that? It
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     about her, isn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned. “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, okay. Spill.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a deep breath. “Okay, so… this week, I was sick. And she—she showed up at my door. With flowers.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, wait, wait.” Alice sounded like she’d nearly dropped her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “She showed up at your
     <em>
      door
     </em>
     ? With
     <em>
      flowers
     </em>
     ? What is this? Enemies to lovers? Aren’t you supposed to hate each other?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s the thing! I thought we did! But then she just…
     <em>
      appeared
     </em>
     . Like it was the most normal thing in the world.” Rio ran a hand through her hair, her pacing quickening as she spoke. “It’s like she’s playing some long game I can’t figure out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice hummed, her tone dripping with intrigue. “Or, and hear me out here, she’s just being nice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But why?” Rio pressed, her voice tinged with frustration.
    </p>
<p>
     “What if it’s not just some weird power play? What if she’s… actually genuine?”
    </p>
<p>
     There was a pause on the other end, and then Alice snickered. “Isn’t that what you secretly love about her? All that
     <em>
      power play
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice” Rio’s voice was sharp, close to scandalized. She stopped in her tracks, glaring at nothing in particular.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay, I’m sorry!” Alice said, though the amusement in her voice was far from apologetic. “It’s just hard to say what her intentions are. But this is all very… fascinating.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed, flopping down onto her couch. “Today, we had coffee.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?!” Alice practically shrieked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, in lesbian terms, you know that you’re one casual date away from being in a relationship. What do you mean you had coffee?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It wasn’t a
     <em>
      date
     </em>
     !” Rio protested, though even as she said it, she wasn’t entirely sure it was true.
    </p>
<p>
     “We just… talked. She asked how I was feeling. Apparently she paid for my coffee. She smiled at me like—like…” She trailed off, suddenly too self aware to finish the thought.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s tone softened, but her teasing edge remained. “Like what, Rio? Like she wants to kiss you senseless?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice!” Rio groaned, pulling a throw pillow over her face as though it might shield her from the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     “Listen,” Alice said, her voice gentler now. “What if—just hypothetically—you
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     like her? Why is that such a bad thing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up, the pillow dropping into her lap. Her heart felt like it was caught in a tug-of-war.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because it is bad,” she said quietly. “I feel like I'm supposed to hate her. She literally put me out of business.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That was… complicated,” Alice said carefully. “But maybe it’s more complicated now because you don’t actually hate her anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head, her thoughts swirling like a storm. “I can’t start something with someone who holds so much power over me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice snorted. “Again, that's a little uncharacteristic of you. Since when are you no longer really into that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice,” Rio warned, but her voice lacked the bite she intended.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice let out a dramatic sigh. “Fine. But you know what I think? I think you’re way past the point of no return. You’re just looking for reasons to be mad at her so you don’t have to admit that you like her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t respond immediately, her mind replaying Agatha’s warm smile, the way she’d brushed a stray curl behind her ear that afternoon, her voice soft and caring as she’d asked if Rio was feeling better.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here’s a thought,” Alice said, her voice brimming with glee. “Stop overthinking.”

<p>
     It was their fourth meeting, though to Agatha, it felt more like four months than four days.
    </p>
<p>
     Their connection had grown palpable, no longer something she nurtured alone while Rio seemed to smother it.
    </p>
<p>
     No—now it felt mutual, like a conversation rather than a tug-of-war.
    </p>
<p>
     Well, except for
     <em>
      one
     </em>
     detail: Rio still didn’t know that she was DTWR.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, the banter had shifted, evolved into something... enjoyable. It was as though Rio had stopped forcing her disdain and started accepting their connection for what it was.
    </p>
<p>
     They were seated at the same table as always.
    </p>
<p>
     The café wasn’t busy—not that it would’ve mattered. Agatha couldn’t take her eyes off Rio anyway. She was fairly certain everyone, including Rio, had noticed. But she didn’t care, not really.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I ask you something?” she began, her voice laced with just enough mischief to make the words hang like a dare.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, ever poised, raised an eyebrow in invitation.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened to the woman you were waiting for at Lalo’s?” Agatha asked, striving for casualness, though her curiosity cut through like a blade.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d been holding onto that question for days, waiting for a moment when Rio’s response wouldn’t be tainted by animosity. She wanted the truth, unfiltered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze dropped to the coffee cup in her hands. Her expression clouded, inscrutable.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing,” she said flatly.
    </p>
<p>
     But then she looked up, and in the brief flicker of hesitation in her eyes, Agatha caught a glimpse of something deeper.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s it?” Agatha pressed, leaning in slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s calm didn’t waver. “Yes. That’s it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha arched an eyebrow, unconvinced. “But you were crazy about her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled softly, and for a moment, her composure cracked just enough to reveal something raw underneath. “I am,” she admitted quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath caught.
    </p>
<p>
     So, that hadn’t changed.
    </p>
<p>
     A strange blend of emotions churned inside her—happiness, disappointment, and something unnameable. It made no sense, and yet it did.
    </p>
<p>
     She swallowed it all down and mustered a teasing smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “So why don’t you run off with her?” she asked lightly, though the weight of the question surprised even her. She hoped Rio hadn’t noticed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s fingers traced the rim of her coffee cup. “I don’t actually know her,” she said, her voice softer now.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re in love with someone you’ve never met?”
    </p>
<p>
     It was dangerous territory, but Agatha couldn’t resist.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s lips quirked slightly, as though at her own absurdity. “We only know each other—oh God, you’re going to laugh—”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me guess,” Agatha interrupted, her grin sharpening. “The internet?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s resigned expression confirmed it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not an app,” she said quickly, cutting off Agatha’s retort. “We email.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve Got Mail,” Agatha quipped, her smile widening. She leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand. “Those are powerful words. Very romantic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shot her a look—a mix of exasperation and disbelief, as though Agatha had conjured something too powerful by saying those words out loud.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought it was adorable.
    </p>
<p>
     She decided not to push any further. Not yet.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m happy for her,” she said instead, her voice light, even as her chest twisted slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     She let the words settle before adding, “Although—may I make a suggestion? Maybe try meeting her again? Just to be sure you’re not being catfished or something equally ridiculous.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised a brow, her lips twitching into the ghost of a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hardly think I need advice from someone who—”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised a finger, cutting her off smoothly. “Let’s not go there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, but the faint curve of her lips lingered, soft and unguarded.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a small moment, but Agatha didn’t miss it—another small victory that she tucked away for later.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After a week of coffee together, Rio stopped trying to figure out Agatha’s angle. It had become clear there wasn’t one—at least not in the way she had expected.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn’t playing some calculated game, wasn’t trying to manipulate her or win her over with some ulterior motive.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s advice—
     <em>
      stop overthinking
     </em>
     —was starting to sound less absurd.
    </p>
<p>
     Their time together, however unexpected, was surprisingly bearable.
    </p>
<p>
     And—dare Rio admit it—even enjoyable.
    </p>
<p>
     Over time, Rio found herself forgetting her grudge.
    </p>
<p>
     It was like a slow, quiet erosion of the walls she’d built around herself. Agatha didn’t push her, didn’t demand anything. She didn’t try to make Rio like her.
    </p>
<p>
     She simply existed, and in doing so, she made the space between them feel a little more comfortable each time.
    </p>
<p>
     At first, Rio resisted.
    </p>
<p>
     She told herself she was being practical—principled. Her loyalty to those principles was still intact, after all.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn’t some fool to be charmed by a few cups of coffee and a bit of sharp banter.
    </p>
<p>
     But as the days went on, Rio caught herself thinking about Agatha when she wasn’t around.
    </p>
<p>
     She found herself looking forward to their next meeting, anticipating the rhythms of their conversations, the way Agatha’s dry humor could pierce through her guarded exterior and leave her laughing before she even realized it.
    </p>
<p>
     It was… weird.
    </p>
<p>
     Really weird.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had always prided herself on being steadfast, unyielding when it came to people like Agatha—sharp, confident, so self-assured it bordered on arrogance.
    </p>
<p>
     However, beneath the polished confidence, there was something unexpected. Something that felt disarming.
    </p>
<p>
     And for reasons Rio couldn’t quite explain, Agatha made her feel… good. At ease. Warm.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, ‘tweaking’?” Rio asked, her voice light as she dipped a chip into guacamole. “What’s that code for?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked, her eyes gleaming with amusement. “
     <em>
      That’s
     </em>
     what she said?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t stop the reluctant smile tugging at her lips. “God, you’re insufferable.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed, grabbing a chip and dipping it into the guac.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, who’s this mystery pen pal? Are we sure she’s not married?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked, sitting back in her chair. “That’s… a leap,” she said, raising an eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged, nonchalant but clearly enjoying herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it? Seems convenient, all this secrecy and waiting. Have you asked her? Like, straight up:
     <em>
      ‘Are you married?’
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio paused mid-chip, the weight of the question settling over her like a heavy blanket.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t thought about it before. She’d assumed her pen pal was a single mother—she only ever mentioned her son and Señor Scratchy.
    </p>
<p>
     But now that Agatha had planted the idea, Rio realized… logically, a spouse wouldn’t necessarily come up in casual conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     DTWR had confessed her devotion to her, sure.
    </p>
<p>
     But she wasn’t sure what that meant anymore, now.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” she admitted reluctantly, feeling a flush creeping up her neck. “I haven’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, a playful challenge in her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe you should.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help the soft chuckle that escaped her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     There it was again—the way Agatha could make her smile even when she didn’t want to.
    </p>
<p>
     Something less about the hard edges and more about the unexpected kindness that slipped through every once in a while.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     That evening, Rio sat at her desk, fingers hovering over her laptop.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she typed:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I know this is probably a little late to be asking, but… are you married? You can be honest.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She hesitated, her thumb poised over the screen, the words feeling both too blunt and too vulnerable all at once.
    </p>
<p>
     She could hear Agatha’s sharp, amused voice in her head, telling her she was ridiculous.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a breath, convinced the question might destroy whatever progress they’d made. But it was out there now.
    </p>
<p>
     Without another thought, she pressed send.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Agatha stared at the message, her lips curving into a wry smile.
    </p>
<p>
     It was oddly endearing that Rio ended up actually asking her this.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Am I married? What kind of question is that? Don’t you know me at all?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She paused, and then typed:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Or wait—let me guess. Your friends think the only reason we haven’t met is because I’m secretly married. Am I right?”
     </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The next day, Agatha sat across from Rio, a plate of nachos between them.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward, her grin practically splitting her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “So… she didn’t exactly answer the question, did she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made a noise of protest, but Agatha could see right through her.
    </p>
<p>
     “She did,” Rio argued, though her voice lacked conviction.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, pushing further. "Really? Because from what I heard, it sounded like she dodged it."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio muttered something under her breath, stabbing a chip into the guacamole like it had personally wronged her.
    </p>
<p>
     “She saw right through me. Classic her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a slow sip of her iced tea. “But she didn’t
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     answer, though,” she pointed out again. She was enjoying this far more than she should.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed, the irritation flickering in her eyes a clear sign that she knew Agatha was right.
    </p>
<p>
     After a beat, she admitted reluctantly, “Not directly.” Her tone was almost sheepish, and it was adorable.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help the sly smile that spread across her face. “Maybe she has… an extremely annoying voice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, but Agatha didn’t miss the faint twitch at the corners of her lips. “I don’t care about that,” Rio said, brushing it off with a dismissive wave.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then what’s the holdup?” Agatha mused aloud, dragging out the words just enough to make Rio shift in her seat. “Unless…”
    </p>
<p>
     She trailed off dramatically, watching as Rio’s suspicion flared.
    </p>
<p>
     “Unless what?” Rio demanded, her gaze narrowing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, nothing,” Agatha replied airily, feigning innocence.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     “She could be waiting until she’s paroled.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could blink, a napkin sailed across the table and hit her square in the face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed, pulling the napkin off with an exaggerated flourish.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, to her surprise, joined in. “Jen thought she might be the Rooftop Killer, you know,” she said between chuckles. “Which is
     <em>
      ridiculous.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha arched an eyebrow, leaning back with a look of mock contemplation. “Is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened her mouth, ready to shoot back, but then closed it again.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wondered—was the truth even more ridiculous?

<p>
<span>
      The next day, they decided to take a walk after their usual coffee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The air outside was cool, heavy with the mingling scents of rain-soaked earth and freshly baked bread. Stalls lined the street, overflowing with bright blooms and glistening produce.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha paused by a fruit vendor’s stand, picking up a mango and inspecting it with exaggerated scrutiny.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So,” she began, her tone light but deliberate, “what’s her handle?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her a warning look. “Don’t start.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha held up her free hand, the picture of innocence. “I won’t look her up or anything, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed deeply. It couldn't hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “D-T-W-R”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What does it stand for?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ,” Rio groaned, her tone edging on a whine
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m serious,” Agatha pressed, her smile sly. “Doing Things With Recklessness? Doesn’t Try Weird Recipes? Dolphin Telling Whale Riddles? Dream, Think, Wonder, Reflect?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t help it—a laugh bubbled out of her before she could clamp it down. She shook her head, a hint of reluctant amusement lighting her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How do you even come up with these?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grinned, totally unfazed. “It’s a gift.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, without missing a beat, she added, “Her stripper name?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow. “Her license plate,” she deadpanned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tapped her chin thoughtfully. “Or the initials of the women she’s slept with.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked at her. “Only four, you think?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shrugged. “Why assume more?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled, her lips curling slightly as she glanced at the stalls around them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Whatever it stands for, it's not that,” she said with a small shake of her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, as long as it’s not ‘Defending Terrible Yacht Rentals,’ we’re good, right?” Agatha joked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “God, no,” Rio said with a firmness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’d
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       never
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      date someone with a boat?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her eyes narrowed at Agatha playfully. “That was an Y, actually.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow at her. “So it was.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They strolled on in a comfortable silence. Agatha let her eyes roam the market, taking in the pops of color and the steady hum of activity
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "By the way," she said casually, glancing at Rio, “how’s your book coming?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s face lit up at the question. Her words spilled out quickly, a mixture of excitement and that usual cool confidence as she described her progress, her ideas, and her latest struggles.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her protagonist, Agnes, was a former detective grappling with the twin shadows of her past: the disgrace of being fired and the devastating loss of her son, both leaving her trapped in an illusion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha listened intently, her gaze fixed on Rio as if the bustling market had faded entirely into the background.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      After Sunday came Monday.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The air was crisp, the kind of late winter chill Rio found refreshing rather than biting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She liked days like this, when the sun was setting in the late afternoon, creating a warmth even though the actual warmth wasn’t there yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She walked with her usual easy stride, her eyes scanning the street but never really lingering, her thoughts elsewhere.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was, on the people next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha walked beside her, a bag of produce slung over her arm, and Nicky trailed just a step behind, poking at his mom’s phone with a casual authority.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There’s a book editor I know from the store,” Rio started, her tone casual.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She flicked her hair out of her face, glancing at Agatha. “She’s been asking about my stuff. Says she’d be happy to read it when I finish.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She let out a soft laugh, a self-conscious sound that didn’t quite match her words. “If I finish it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tilted her head, curious. Her eyes brightened. “That’s great. Do you think she’s serious?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged. “She’s the type who loves telling people what they should write. Still, if I didn’t have all this free time, I never would’ve—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She paused mid-thought, realizing where her words were leading. Her brow furrowed briefly, as if weighing whether to finish the sentence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Discovered you’re actually really good at it?” Agatha offered, her voice light but not without depth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked. “Sure. Let’s go with that.” She looked ahead, her thoughts briefly wandering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The truth is,” she said, her tone softening, “it’s because of
      <em>
       her
      </em>
      . She made me think I could do this.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grinned, the kind of grin that was sharper than it had to be but still felt oddly warm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Dolphin Talking Whale Riddles, huh?” she teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      From behind them, Nicky’s voice chimed in, dry as ever. “That’s the weirdest name ever.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed, a genuine, unrestrained sound. “You’ve got a point there, Nicky.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I always do, right mom?” Nicky said solemnly, looking up from Agatha’s phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was a twinkle in his eyes when he looked up at his mom. Rio could tell there was a silent understanding between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just ruffled his hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head, her smirk still lingering. “Ms. DTWR. Insight into my soul. You know how it is,” she said, looking back up at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, well,” Agatha replied, her lips twitching into a smirk of her own, “hard to top that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio ignored the way her heart skipped a beat at that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead, she shot her a side-eye, arching an eyebrow. “Well, I keep bumping into you. Hope your mango’s ripe,” she said, smoothly steering the conversation elsewhere.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “I think it is,” she said, playing along. “Want to bump into me again Wednesday? Around lunchtime?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked up again, his expression flat. “Is this flirting? Because it’s bad.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Both women burst out laughing, the sound echoing in the crisp winter air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave Nicky a playful nudge. “Guess you’ll just have to suffer through it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Love my life,” Nicky muttered, but there was a small, reluctant smile on his face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He didn't need to look up to know that both women were blushing furiously.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Tuesday. Agatha stood in front of the building, her hands shoved deep into the pockets of her coat, the morning air cool against her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       The Shop Around the Corner.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The worn sign still hung above the door. The place was dead, but still had its charm—character that PurpleBooks with its sterile rows of shelves could never replicate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She could already see it, though, as clear as if it were real: their vibrant children’s books stacked neatly on low, colorful shelves, cozy reading nooks with beanbags and blankets, and an atmosphere that hummed with creativity and warmth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lady Storybook reading oud a few chapters, surrounded by energetic, curious children, perhaps.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Just as it used to be.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha came home to the wooden surface of her dinner table, scattered with papers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The past weeks, she had sat at that table sorting through a tangle of paperwork, negotiating with a landlord who seemed stuck in 1995 and convincing her board that this venture was a “strategic expansion” rather than a sentimental whim.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      In truth, it was both.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tomorrow, she would see Rio again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wanted this to be a surprise, but did not know yet how to go about it. Agatha sighed, leaning back in her chair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She glanced up to see Nicky standing in the doorway, holding a peanut butter sandwich in one hand and a book in the other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s up, bud?” she asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re staring at that paper like it’s gonna bite you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled. “Just figuring something out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It's about Rio’s bookstore, right?” Nicky perched on the edge of the desk, his legs swinging. “You’ve been calling about it a lot.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It is.” She tapped the deed with her finger.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve finally managed to get the paperwork for turning it into a new children’s section for PurpleBooks. It’ll be part of the community again.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky chewed thoughtfully. “But you’re giving it to Rio, right?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha blinked. “What makes you say that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He shrugged, a knowing look on his face. “It's her place. And she likes books. Plus, you keep pretending you’re not talking about her every time you mention the store.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed despite herself. “And once again! You’re too smart for your own good.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know,” Nicky said with a grin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But yes, sort of. That is, if she wants to.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, when are you gonna tell her?”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's heart had been slowly stitching itself back together over the past few weeks. The days weren’t without their struggles, but they came with little triumphs too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her book was taking a bit more shape; the words, once elusive, now flowed with a renewed sense of purpose. Her energy was returning. It felt like healing—clumsy, uneven, but real.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She’d told herself this progress was a sign that maybe, just maybe, the closing of
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Shop Around the Corner
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      was a blessing in disguise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A lie, perhaps, but one she leaned on to make peace with the loss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her life was shifting in other ways, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Phone calls or coffees with Alice had become a comforting ritual, their conversations often veering from unhinged to dead serious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia was leaving for Chile, a bittersweet goodbye as she prepared to chase new horizons.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And Jen, in her enthusiasm, sent regular updates about the new job at PurpleBooks that she was finding more and more bearable. It was comforting, even if Rio didn’t share the same excitement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And there was Agatha, of course. A presence that had become a constant, in the literal sense as well as the figurative sense—Rio found herself always thinking of her, subconsciously or not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Still, when she walked into their usual café, she wasn’t expecting much beyond the usual banter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But as she slid into the seat across from Agatha, she couldn’t shake the tension radiating from her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was always a certain energy between them, but this tension felt unlike any before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hi. You look serious.” Rio asked, tilting her head in curiosity. “Is everything okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her own voice betrayed nothing but casual concern, though her pulse quickened at the flicker of something unreadable in Agatha’s eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, then pushed an envelope across the table. “I am. But this—it’s for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio frowned, her fingers brushing the envelope as though it might disappear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She opened it cautiously, unfolding the papers inside. Her brow furrowed as the words sank in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What is this?” Her voice was barely above a whisper, disbelief dulling its usual edge.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s
      <em>
       yours
      </em>
      ,” Agatha said simply, leaning forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Shop Around the Corner
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Well, not entirely. The building’s technically part of PurpleBooks now, but I want you to run it. Bring it back to life. Make it something special again.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stared at her, words failing her for the first time in weeks. “You’re joking.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Dead serious. I’m sorry it took this long to sort out,” Agatha added, her tone uncharacteristically soft.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But you were right. That store—it’s not just a building. It’s a part of the neighborhood’s legacy. Its heart and soul. PurpleBooks can’t replace that, no matter how many stores we open.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio swallowed, her throat suddenly tight. “Why now?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because it needed to be done,” Agatha said, her voice firm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I had to find a way to make it work, and now I have. And yes,” she added with a rueful smile, “you’ll technically be a PurpleBooks employee. But you’ll have creative control. This will be your space.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words hung in the air between them, heavy with possibility.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio glanced back at the papers, her mind racing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A storm of emotions swirled within her—gratitude, hope, even a spark of anger at the fact that this offer came from the very one she had blamed for the store’s demise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But above all, there was an overwhelming sense of something like relief, a tiny ember of her old self rekindling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know what to say,” she finally admitted, her voice raw.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, that familiar sparkle returning to her eyes. “Say yes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a laugh, startled and unfiltered, as though it had been pulled from somewhere deep inside her. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d laughed like that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay,” she said, her voice steadier now. “Let’s do it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha extended her hand across the table, and Rio took it, her grip firm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For a moment, their eyes locked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s expression was unreadable, but there was something fierce and steady there that made Rio feel… so very
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       seen
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before she could think twice, Rio pushed her chair back and walked around the table.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She gently but firmly grasped Agatha’s elbows, coaxing her to her feet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, without hesitation, she wrapped Agatha in a tight embrace.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The movement surprised them both, but as Rio held on, the unexpected warmth and rightness of the moment anchored her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Holding her felt inexplicably right, as though she were slipping into something achingly familiar—a connection so profound it overwhelmed her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you,” she murmured, her voice catching on the words. For the first time in a long time, they didn’t feel hollow.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Later, in the calm of the evening, Agatha sat at her desk, typing up a message.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was time for the next step.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “How about meeting Saturday? The first day of spring. 4 P.M. There's a place in Riverside Park at 88th Street where the path curves and when you come around the curve, you'll find me waiting.”

<p>
     Spring came quicker than Agatha had anticipated.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn’t ready for how much the season suited Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The way the soft, pale sunlight caught the edges of her dark hair. She leaned against the counter at Grey’s Papaya with an effortless grace, wearing a black, leather jacket—all of it left Agatha’s thoughts tangled in ways that were entirely inconvenient.
    </p>
<p>
     She was pretending to deliberate over the toppings for her hot dog, but in reality, Agatha was stealing glances at Rio. It was almost stupid how mesmerized she was by something so mundane as Rio spreading mustard like she had all the time in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, tomorrow, huh?” Agatha asked, eyebrows lifting in surprise. She tried to be casual, but her voice had a note of curiosity she couldn’t quite mask.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tomorrow,” Rio confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head slowly, amused. “Whoa.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio replied. Her lips curled into a small smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pretended this was the newest, most fresh information
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     “Isn’t that amazing? Maybe you’ve seen her and don’t even know it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart raced as she studied Rio’s reaction, searching for a sign that Rio might know, might suspect. But she was unreadable, her focus briefly shifting to her hot dog as if it held all the answers to the universe.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, she grinned. “That would be crazy.”
    </p>
<p>
     The sunlight warmed the left side of her face.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Walking uptown with Agatha was becoming one of those unexpected rhythms she wasn’t ready to name. The two of them, side by side, felt like the most natural thing in the world—except for the way Rio’s thoughts kept tripping over themselves whenever Agatha spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     “She could be the Zipper Woman,” Agatha said suddenly, her voice pulling Rio back to the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced over, raising an eyebrow. “Who?”
    </p>
<p>
     “This woman on Amsterdam Avenue who repairs zippers,” Agatha explained, as if this were the most profound revelation. “You’ll never have to buy new luggage again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, but a smile tugged at the corner of her lips. “Stop teasing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not teasing,” Agatha said, her voice dropping conspiratorially. “Timing is everything. She waited until you were primed. Until you knew there was no other woman you could ever love.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words hit Rio somewhere deeper than she wanted to admit. There was something in Agatha’s tone, something in the way she was looking at her, that made Rio’s heart stutter. For a split second, it felt like the world had tilted just slightly on its axis.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Rio murmured, the word slipping out before she could stop it. “I guess that’s true.”
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't, not really. Rio was starting to doubt, more and more, if DTWR was the one for her. Or—the
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     one.
    </p>
<p>
     Which was not convenient at all, since she was meeting the woman in only a day.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced at Agatha, expecting to find her smirking, but instead caught something deeper in her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     The sunlight caught on her lashes, making her blue eyes even brighter. Rio couldn’t help but notice the faint freckles on Agatha’s nose, the way her lips curved like she was always on the verge of saying something clever.
    </p>
<p>
     The teasing might have been a shield, but Rio could see beneath it now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sometimes I wonder…” Agatha began, her voice softer now, uncertain.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tensed, every nerve on edge. “What?” Her tone was sharper than she intended, but she couldn’t help it.
    </p>
<p>
     She had a sinking feeling she already knew where this was going.
    </p>
<p>
     They came to a stop. Agatha turned to face her fully, the bustling city around them fading into a distant hum. Her expression was open, uncharacteristically so, and Rio felt her defenses crumble just a little.
    </p>
<p>
     “If I hadn’t been PurpleBooks and you hadn’t been The Shop Around the Corner,” Agatha said slowly, deliberately, “and we’d just met…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s heart lurched painfully. She stared at Agatha, her breath caught in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Her smile was playful, but those eyes—God, those eyes—were brimming with something Rio wasn’t sure she could handle.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t,” Rio whispered, her voice faltering. She couldn’t let this happen, couldn’t let Agatha say what she was so actively hiding from.
    </p>
<p>
     But Agatha pressed on, her eyes never leaving Rio’s. “I would’ve asked for your number, Rio. And I wouldn’t have been able to wait 24 hours before calling and asking you out. Coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie—hell, for as long as we both shall live.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her smile was soft, teasing, but her eyes held a sincerity that made Rio’s chest ache.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s carefully crafted composure shattered for a brief moment. Her throat tightened, and she could feel her pulse hammering in her ears. “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “And then we never would’ve been at war,” Agatha continued, her voice tinged with wistfulness.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio said quickly, almost reflexively, but her hesitation betrayed her. She didn’t even know why she was holding on to this resentment anymore, why she insisted on keeping her distance.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile softened, but her eyes were intent. “The only fight we’d ever have is about what we’d watch on a Saturday night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who fights about that?” Rio smirked. She couldn't help herself; Agatha's smile was too disarming, too undoing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Some people,” Agatha replied, her lips curling.“But not us.”
    </p>
<p>
     The space between them felt heavy, charged, and Rio couldn’t look away from Agatha’s gaze. It was as if she could see right through her, past the walls, the aloofness, and the carefully constructed detachment.
    </p>
<p>
     “If only…” Agatha murmured, her voice a fragile thread in the stillness.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed hard, her chest tight.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to close the distance, to give in to the pull that had been growing between them, but the fear was suffocating.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please,” she said instead, her voice quieter now, trembling slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t move, her gaze holding Rio’s like an unspoken promise.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me ask you something,” Agatha said finally, her voice softer now, yet laced with challenge.
    </p>
<p>
     “How come you’ll forgive her for standing you up, but you won’t forgive me for a little, tiny thing like putting you out of business? You know I tried to fix it, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     The question hit like a punch to the gut. Rio froze, the weight of it unraveling something inside her.
    </p>
<p>
     She shook her head slowly, searching for an answer, but none came.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled softly, her expression melting into something more tender, almost pleading. “Oh, how I wish you would.”
    </p>
<p>
     The raw vulnerability in her voice was too much. Rio’s resolve wavered, her walls cracking under the weight of everything unspoken. For a fleeting moment, she wondered what it would feel like to stop resisting, to let herself fall.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked up, in Agatha's eyes again. But oh—how she wished she wouldn't have.
    </p>
<p>
     ”I’m sorry, I— I have to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Then, Agatha nodded, her smile faint.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah. Have fun, tomorrow.”
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Rio sat at her desk, tapping her pen against the polished wood surface as her thoughts churned. On her mind were two things: Agatha, and Agatha. Her dual offerings—the business proposal and the sort-of-confession of love—had been looping in her head.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      For as long as we both shall live.
     </em>
     Agatha had really said that.
    </p>
<p>
     She decided to deal with the professional part first: work had always been the greatest distraction. Even if said work was still all tangled up with what she needed distraction
     <em>
      from
     </em>
     , but alas.
    </p>
<p>
     She began an email containing a list of information and questions for Agatha regarding her proposal.
    </p>
<p>
     If Rio was to run The Shop around The Corner again, she really, truly wanted to run it. In her way, not according to a profit focused, capitalist PurpleBooks manual.
    </p>
<p>
     An hour later, her inbox dinged, but the sender wasn’t Agatha. It was her assistant.
    </p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The message was perfectly polite, but her eyes snagged on the postscript.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      PS: Here is Agatha’s phone number. I’m not officially allowed to give it out, but hey, emergencies happen. ;)
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smirked despite herself, amused. She copied the number into her phone, planning to file it away for later use. Then her phone chirped:
    </p>
<p>
<b>
<em>
       Contact already saved.
      </em>
</b>
</p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. That didn’t make sense.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t have Agatha’s number—did she?
    </p>
<p>
     When the contact popped up on her screen, her breath caught in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3
     </b>
</p>
<p>
     “What the—?” she muttered aloud.
    </p>
<p>
     Her brain felt like it had short-circuited. She opened her contacts, stared at the saved name, and then cross-checked the number against Billy’s email. They matched. Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
     Her chest tightened, her breath hitching. No. No way.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart pounded as she reread the email, then quickly fired off a follow-up:

<em>
      Thanks, Billy. Just to clarify… is this really Agatha’s number?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     His reply came fast, almost like he’d been waiting for it:
    </p>
<p>
<b>
      From:
     </b>
     Billy
     <br/>
<em>
      Yes. This is her. :)
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sat back in her chair, her hands covering her face as realization dawned. Billy’s cryptic reply said everything. He
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was DTWR.
    </p>
<p>
     Her mind raced.
    </p>
<p>
     Memories from the past few weeks blurred into focus with new meaning.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn’t just some random interloper who had upended her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was the woman who had sent her those emails, the one who’d known her fears, her quirks, her soul.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman who Rio had dreamed about, whose words had kept her company on lonely nights.
    </p>
<p>
     Her chest swelled with a confusing mix of emotions—shock, relief, embarrassment, and something undeniably warm.
    </p>
<p>
     So she wasn’t stood up at Lola’s…
    </p>
<p>
     And of course,
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     is when Agatha figured it out.
    </p>
<p>
     She thought of the past couple of weeks.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s sharp wit, her teasing remarks about “DTWR.” All those sly smiles and knowing glances…
    </p>
<p>
     And Nicky!
     <em>
      He
     </em>
     was DTWR’s 8 year old son.
    </p>
<p>
     And when Agatha had taken care of her during that fever… it all made sense now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been there, watching over her, already knowing who Rio was.
    </p>
<p>
     The “Dolphin Telling Whale Riddles” jokes, which must have amused her to no end.
    </p>
<p>
     The daisies that she brought.
    </p>
<p>
     Her cheeks burned at the memory of confessions she’d made to DTWR—about her past, about her deepest thoughts, about the way Agatha herself, in real life, drove her nuts.
    </p>
<p>
     If Agatha remembered every detail about Rio in the same way that she remembered all her words… God.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to be angry—Agatha had all the pieces, every insight into who Rio was.
    </p>
<p>
     She could have manipulated that knowledge, wielding it to make Rio fall for her, weaving a trap from their shared words.
    </p>
<p>
     Once again, she had not shown Rio who she truly was.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to be so, so angry.
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio realized, she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     —Agatha had been gentle, and patient.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t exploited their connection; instead, she had become someone Rio fell for twice—once as DTWR and once again as the Agatha she met last fall.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart thudded in her chest: the two women who consumed her every waking thought were the same.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Agatha was lounging on her couch, her feet propped on the armrest, when her phone buzzed.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced at the screen, smirking as Billy’s name popped up.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d barely swiped to answer before his voice, bright with his usual energy, came through.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, boss! Quick question: how’s your Saturday going to look?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “You know how it looks, Billy. You manage my schedule. What’s up?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well,” Billy began, his voice taking on a sing-song quality that instantly raised her suspicions, “you know how you’ve been all secretive and coy about Rio? I might’ve, uh, given her your number today.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up, her stomach tightening. “You what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy continued, undeterred. “She emailed me earlier with some business questions, and you know me—I’m a helper. Figured I’d give her a nudge in the right direction.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, her mind racing. “Billy. Please tell me you didn’t just hand her my number.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well…” He drew out the word, clearly enjoying himself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Technically, I wrote that it was for emergencies only, but I have a feeling she might’ve pieced things together. She sent a follow-up email asking if it was really yours, so, yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned. “Billy, I was planning to tell her tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh!” His tone shifted to surprise, then a mix of sheepishness and pride.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, then… you’re welcome? I mean, at least now she has time to process, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed, standing and pacing the room. “You better hope she’s in a forgiving mood, Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “C’mon, Agatha. I think she’ll be fine. Might even be thrilled.”
    </p>
<p>
     His words gave her pause. Thrilled? The idea sparked a hopeful flutter in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     “All right,” Agatha relented, her voice quieter. “I need to go. Thanks, I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome!” Billy chirped.
    </p>
<p>
     The call ended, leaving Agatha holding her phone and feeling the weight of what was about to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was clever, intuitive, and stubborn… And if she had indeed figured it out…
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her messages, her fingers hesitating over the keyboard before she started typing.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Hey. Just thinking about tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She sent the text, then immediately followed with another:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Everything okay?

       ALICE

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       OMG ALICE PICK UP YOUR PHONE
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       !!!!!!
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Finally, Alice picked up, her voice sharp with a mix of humor and curiosity. “Okay, okay, I’m here! What’s the crisis?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio didn’t even pause for breath. “I made a discovery, and I genuinely have no idea what to do with myself right now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her words tumbled out in a rush, her voice pitched high with barely restrained energy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice, ever the calm in Rio’s storm, responded with her usual wry tone. “Is this about DTWR? Or Agatha? Or am I completely off and this is about something unrelated to your eternal soap opera of a love life?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio groaned loudly. “It
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       is
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      about DTWR. And Agatha. Because…” Her thoughts short-circuited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice pounced. “Because what? Don’t leave me hanging, woman!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blurted it out, the words spilling from her mouth. “Agatha
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       is
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      DTWR.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was a beat of silence before Alice exploded. “Shut up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m serious! Agatha is DTWR.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh my god. OH MY GOD, RIO!” Alice practically shouted, her excitement palpable even through the phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I KNOW!” Rio’s voice cracked on the words, a mix of incredulity and exasperation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice, trying to process, asked, “Okay, so how do you feel? Are you spiraling, or are you, like, floating on air?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a groan. “It’s like—I feel betrayed, but.. More like a ‘oh-great-you’ve-made-me-feel-like-a-clueless-idiot’ way.
      <em>
       Again
      </em>
      .”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice laughed. “You mean, like when you found out she was the owner of PurpleBooks?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Exactly,” Rio said, her voice tinged with frustration.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Only worse because she’s been lying to my
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       face
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . This whole time.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, but…” Alice paused, her grin almost audible. “Come on. You’ve got to give it to her—Agatha does have a flair for the dramatic.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio huffed. “Oh, don’t even get me started on that. Because how long she’s been sitting on this… Was she
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       ever
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      going to tell me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re meeting her tomorrow, right?” Alice prompted, her voice a little more serious now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hesitated. “Yeah…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, what’s the plan? Are you waiting until then, or are you gonna storm over there tonight, guns blazing?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio found herself grinning despite everything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Honestly? I can’t wait to see her. I want to yell at her. Like, really let her have it. But also…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She trailed off, her thoughts suddenly veering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice’s voice softened, teasing. “Also what?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked, a mischievous edge creeping into her tone. “I kind of want to make her squirm first. Keep her in suspense. You know, give her a taste of her own medicine.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ooh, I like it,” Alice said approvingly. “Keep her guessing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She sent me a message earlier asking if we’re still on for tomorrow. I was thinking about hinting that I know. Something subtle....”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Subtle like a brick, or subtle like a knife twisting? What are we going for here?” Alice asked, laughing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You think
      <em>
       I
      </em>
      know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, okay,” Alice said, her voice brimming with playful enthusiasm. “Here’s what you do—say just enough to get under her skin. Let her sweat it out all night.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now, go wreak havoc, but also… you know, try not to lose your mind in the process.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed, a mix of exasperation and affection. “Too late for that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, I figured,” Alice said with a laugh. “Have fun, though!”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      The seconds ticked by with excruciating slowness, each one stretching endlessly as Agatha stared at her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Rio’s reply finally appeared, her chest tightened, her breath catching as she opened it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I’m great. Can’t wait either. Should I bring a mango?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha froze, her pulse leaping.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was deliberate—had to be. Rio
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       knew
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
     Because who the fuck would ever propose to bring a mango to a first date,
     <em>
      without
     </em>
     context?
    </p>
<p>
<span>
      Her stomach twisted, a wild tangle of excitement and dread. Agatha leaned back into the couch, clutching her phone like it might explain the universe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew. She was sure of it now. But
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       how
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      did she feel about it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For a brief moment, Agatha allowed herself to hope.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe this wasn’t the disaster she feared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe—
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       no
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . She shoved the thought aside. It wasn’t safe to let herself spiral like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If Rio was angry, that answer had been hiding a storm. If she was hurt…well, that was worse.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha reread the message, the words running circles in her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn’t stop the nervous laugh that bubbled up, even as her hands trembled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      God, this was agonizing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had been prepared for a confrontation tomorrow, not this prelude of suspense, this waiting game that left her twisting in knots.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Finally, she typed a reply, her fingers moving on autopilot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Bring the mango. And maybe a handkerchief—I hear they’re great conversation starters.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She hit send before she could second-guess herself. As the message disappeared into the ether, her heart thudded painfully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The response came faster than she expected: a single laughing emoji.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha exhaled sharply, relief and anticipation swirling together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t much, but it told her what she needed to know.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let her head fall back against the couch, staring at the ceiling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So Rio knew—knew that
      <em>
       she knew.
      </em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But what lay beneath? Did she feel betrayed? Relieved? Something more?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone sat silent in her lap, a tiny harbinger of tomorrow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s pulse quickened at the thought of seeing Rio face-to-face, of having everything out in the open.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tomorrow couldn’t come soon enough. But for now, all she could do was wait—and hope.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Riverside Park was alive with quiet energy, the kind that only early mornings could bring.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Joggers passed in steady rhythms, and a golden light danced on the surface of the Hudson River.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stood at the meeting spot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She’d barely slept the night before, her thoughts running a relentless loop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Every nerve in her body was taut, her thoughts buzzing with anticipation and disbelief.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was DTWR. DTWR was Agatha. Agatha was—
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stared out at the river, the wind brushing cool against her skin, though it did little to steady the riot of nerves coursing through her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The world around her was alive with faint sounds—the lapping of water, the distant hum of city life—but her focus was elsewhere, straining against the silence behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, faintly, the sound of footsteps.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her heart jolted. For an instant, she couldn’t decide whether to turn or wait.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her breath hitched, and she gripped the edge of the railing, grounding herself against the surge of anticipation that rose unbidden.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The steps grew louder, closer, each one vibrating through her chest as if the sound were tied to the erratic thrum of her pulse.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Finally, she turned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The figure moved toward her, slow and deliberate, framed by the last golden light of the setting sun.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Dark hair caught the breeze, and the outline of familiar blue eyes grew clearer with every step.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was her.
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      It was her—Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s breath caught, her body torn between the urge to stay frozen and the pull of something she couldn’t quite name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their gazes locked, and for a split second, the noise of the park, the rush of the river, even the thundering of Rio’s own pulse seemed to fade away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s stride faltered, just slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The moment stretched—an invisible thread pulling tighter, drawing them closer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then, as if they’d silently agreed on it, both of their faces broke into matching grins.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t help it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s smile was infectious, and something about the way they were looking at each other felt so absurdly natural, so perfectly
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       right
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , that laughter bubbled up in her chest before she could stop it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha mirrored the reaction, her grin widening as she slowed to a stop a few feet away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Neither of them spoke at first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The grin they shared felt like an acknowledgment of everything—the absurdity, the tension, the months of connection that had led to this moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The Green Witch,” Agatha said, her voice soft but warm, and unguarded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “DTWR,” Rio replied, a quiet laugh escaping her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You didn’t bring a mango,” Agatha noted, her lips curving into that infuriatingly familiar smirk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tilted her head, her eyes narrowing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ve known all along, haven’t you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded slowly, her smirk fading. “I have. Since Lola’s.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her expression softened, her voice quieter now, carrying an unguarded tremor that betrayed her vulnerability.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I should have told you right away, I know. But I wasn’t sure...”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hesitated, her gaze searching Rio’s. “I wasn’t sure you’d want it to be me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio froze, the words landing like a stone in the pit of her stomach.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She’d already pieced this truth together herself, but hearing it aloud, spoken in Agatha’s voice, was something else entirely.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You…” Her voice faltered. “You might be right.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They stood there in the quiet aftermath of the confession, the world narrowing to the space between them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The breeze tugged at Agatha’s dark hair, strands catching the fading sunlight, and Rio couldn’t stop herself from noticing the flush high on her cheeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Still, it made me feel like an idiot, Agatha. Like I was chasing some imaginary connection while you—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stopped, the words catching in her throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stepped closer, her voice firm but gentle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “While I what? Fell for you in the same way? Because I did, Rio. I have. You know that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wanted to look away, but she couldn’t.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s blue eyes held her there, unflinching and earnest, and for once, they weren’t teasing or veiled. They were open, and Rio found herself drowning in their warmth, their steadiness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, but…” Despite herself, Rio let out a short laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It placed me in this impossible situation! I mean, who does that, Agatha? Make themselves their own competition?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A small smile played at Agatha’s lips, though it didn’t reach her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t know how to tell you,” she admitted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was pretty sure I had ruined it before I even started. That I’d lose you before I even had the chance to have you. So, I thought... Maybe if you got to know me first, the real me…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She trailed off, shaking her head. “It was selfish. I see that now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit her lip, her gaze dropping to the ground.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “God, I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be you so badly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha exhaled sharply, the sound catching somewhere between relief and disbelief.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She took one final step forward, closing the remaining distance between them, and Rio felt her breath hitch as Agatha’s warmth became something tangible.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s your lucky day, then,” Agatha whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked up, her heart pounding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The distant murmur of the park faded, and all Rio could hear was the soft rhythm of her own breathing, mingling with Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The weight of the moment pressed against her chest, hesitation forgotten, and something inside her urged her forward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m going to kiss you,” Rio declared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyebrows lifted in surprise, but her lips curved into a knowing smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please do.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And that was all it took.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s fingers found the lapel of Agatha’s jacket, curling there, pulling her closer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then her lips were on Agatha’s—tentative, first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But the answer was immediate and clear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha leaned in, meeting her halfway, and the kiss deepened, not from tension or desperation, but from an overwhelming sense of inevitability.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hands found Rio’s waist, pulling her closer, anchoring her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The kiss was both electrifying and grounding, a collision of chaos and clarity that made Rio’s head spin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She smiled against Agatha’s lips, unable to help herself, and felt Agatha’s answering grin in return.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Every unspoken argument, every stolen glance, every lingering touch—they all seemed to dissolve into this singular moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s hand slid to the nape of Agatha’s neck, her fingers tangling in her hair as if afraid to let go.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If only she didn’t need to breathe, at some point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they broke apart, the world around them seemed louder, brighter, but Rio hardly noticed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stayed close, her forehead resting lightly against Agatha’s, her lips curved in a smile she couldn’t quite hide.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well,” Agatha murmured, her voice low and teasing, though there was a faint tremble to it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That was unexpected.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed softly. “Liar. You’ve been expecting that for weeks.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe,” Agatha admitted, her smile widening. “But I didn’t know it’d be
      <em>
       this
      </em>
      good.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned back slightly, just enough to meet Rio’s gaze.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her eyes were impossibly bright, shimmering with a warmth that made Rio’s chest ache.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The way Agatha looked at her—soft, steady, unguarded—was unlike anything Rio had ever felt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was grounding and disarming all at once.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was strange, really. Here was the woman Rio had thought about endlessly, agonized over, even warred with in her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And yet, seeing her now, there was no disconnect.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No fracture between who Agatha had been as DTWR and who she was standing before Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It didn’t feel like two separate people.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It felt like Agatha had always been there, quietly slotting herself into the corners of Rio’s life until she fit so seamlessly Rio couldn’t imagine it any other way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you have any plans for the rest of your Sunday?” Rio then asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even as the words left her mouth, she felt an odd out-of-body sensation. It wasn’t nerves—not exactly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was more like a quiet certainty that startled her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s lips curved into that lopsided grin Rio was beginning to adore.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just these,” she replied casually, gesturing to them. Her tone was light, but her eyes betrayed something deeper. “Why?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Come home with me,” Rio whispered, her voice steady, even as her heart thundered in her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tilted her head slightly, her expression softening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, without hesitation, she took Rio’s hand in hers, her fingers fitting perfectly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “All right,” she said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They started walking, their hands still entwined, the late afternoon light spilling golden hues over the city.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They passed by
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       The Shop Around the Corner
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , and as they did, Agatha gave Rio’s hand a gentle squeeze.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t a dramatic gesture—nothing more than a small, subtle acknowledgment—but it sent a wave of warmth through Rio that she couldn’t quite explain.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She squeezed back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she glanced over at Agatha, the easy smile on her face was enough to make Rio’s own heart feel ridiculously full.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha caught her looking and arched a teasing eyebrow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nothing,” Rio replied, her smile widening as she shook her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chuckled softly, her eyes crinkling at the corners in a way that made Rio’s chest tighten.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nothing?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay,” she admitted, her voice warm, playful. “Everything. You.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t respond right away, but the her fingers tightened slightly around Rio’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They continued walking, the city bustling around them, but for Rio, everything else seemed to fade into the background.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      It was only the second time Agatha had entered Rio’s apartment, but the feeling was entirely different this time. The space was exactly as she remembered it—cozy and lived-in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But everything else had changed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The walk here had been a revelation in itself. The silence between them wasn’t the kind she feared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But there was a tension—an electricity sparking between their hands as they brushed together, a pull that only grew stronger with every step.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, inside Rio’s apartment, Agatha let her gaze drift over the familiar surroundings.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was so quintessentially
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Rio
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . The soft lighting and warm tones felt like stepping into her mind—layered, intelligent, and inviting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She felt an almost unbearable fondness swell in her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But before she could linger on it too long, Rio spun around, her movements quick and certain, and cupped Agatha’s face in her hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Without hesitation, Rio kissed her—deeply, decisively.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha barely had time to process the rush of heat before her back met the door with a thud.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She gasped into the kiss.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s hands were everywhere and nowhere, a contrast of softness and urgency.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The years of sharing thoughts, longing, banter and restrained feelings between them shattered in that instant, leaving Agatha with nothing but pure sensation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The self-possession she prided herself on, the careful mask she always wore—it melted away entirely under Rio’s touch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they finally broke apart, Agatha’s breath came in shallow bursts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn’t seem to stop staring at Rio, at her flushed cheeks and those impossibly dark, sparkling eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a sheepish little laugh, breaking the intensity of the moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Once again, I’m the worst hostess. Can I take your coat? Do you want something to drink?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha blinked, trying to steady herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you serious right now?” she asked, her voice a little breathless.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But Rio just grinned and kissed her again, quick and teasing, before slipping her coat off and tossing it onto a nearby chair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The simplicity of the gesture grounded Agatha, even as her heart raced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Water,” Agatha finally managed to say, her voice a little hoarse. “Water would be great.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded and moved toward the kitchen, leaving Agatha standing there, trying to catch her breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The nerves came rushing back now, flooding her as she watched Rio move with such ease.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      How could someone make her feel so completely unmoored and yet so entirely safe at the same time?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Rio returned, she set two glasses of water on the small dinner table, then approached Agatha with an unhurried, deliberate pace.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was something in the way she moved—an assurance that left Agatha mesmerized.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stopped just in front of her, their bodies almost but not quite touching.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We have all the time in the world,” she said softly, her voice steady and soothing. “Relax.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s laugh was shaky, and she found herself confessing before she even knew she was going to speak.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m… nervous. I never am.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tilted her head, her smirk softening into something more vulnerable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why?” Agatha asked, her voice barely above a whisper. She took a step closer, the space between them vanishing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s dark eyes flicked over Agatha’s face, lingering on her lips before returning to her gaze.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because,” she said slowly, “once we start…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She gestured faintly between them, her fingers brushing Agatha’s,
     </span>
<span>
      “This… I might never want anything else.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s heart pounded in her chest, the weight of Rio’s words settling over her like a heavy, exhilarating blanket.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her breath hitched, but she didn’t hesitate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Would that be the worst thing?” she asked, her voice tinged with a mixture of hope and challenge.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes searched hers for a long moment, as though testing the truth of her words.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, with a smile so disarming it made Agatha’s knees weak, she murmured, “Only one way to find out.”

<p>
<span>
      The glasses of water stood untouched on the table as Rio’s hands glided down Agatha’s neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her touch was firm, yet tender, as she drew her closer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s own fingers gripped Rio’s hips, their pressure both grounding and desperate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s fingertips left a trail of fire against her skin, igniting goosebumps that rippled across her body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A storm churned inside Agatha—urgency clashed with a frantic sort of panic, not the kind that paralyzes with fear, but the kind that overwhelms with desire, leaving her mind reeling, unsure where to begin. It was intoxicating, a flood of sensation coursing through her veins.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And so, she just stood there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But then, Rio leaned forward, her lips brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear. It was the softest touch, but Agatha’s breath hitched.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She felt the spark all through her body, and suddenly felt that nervous, restless energy disappear, replaced by a hunger that was strong and determined.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her hands hadn’t trembled, not quite, but it felt as though that shakiness was now replaced by a decisiveness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A decisiveness that ran through her movements, through her hands, when she let them roam over Rio’s body, mapping the curves of her waist, her breasts, and the softness of her skin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She let her fingers delve beneath her shirt, stretching the fabric, seeking the warmth beneath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fuck, Agatha,” Rio breathed, her voice low and ragged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked, feeling a surge of power and confidence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Should we take this to…  The bedroom?” she murmured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She heard her own voice — hoarse, desire-laden. And she saw what it did to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That spark reappeared in her eyes: it was as though she needed no further encouragement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And so they stumbled down the hallway, hands exploring, lips never parting for more than a second.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt a haze set over them, this feeling of them being the only two in this space; in the world for that matter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The bedroom was dimly lit, the only light filtering in through the half-closed curtains.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She only vaguely registered all this—Rio’s strong hands pushed her, gently, onto the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stared up at her, the way Rio stood before her, slowly lowering herself, her dark hair framing her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The warmth in Agatha’s stomach burned as
     </span>
<span>
      Rio covered her body with hers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was this silent, yet confident energy to her, so very much like that first day that Agatha met her in
      <em>
       The Shop around The Corner.
      </em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is this okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Most people hid behind their walls, their eyes veiled with caution. But not Rio. Not then, and certainly not now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wet her lips.
     </span>
<span>
      She met those dark eyes, so close, so unguarded, and tried to mirror the openness she found there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Very much so.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Those eyes, that now lingered on her lips again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was covering Agatha’s body fully, her weight only slightly on her lower arms, that she had placed around Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, her lips found Agatha’s again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She let herself get lost.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She could do this for hours, truly. But her body, her tingling fingertips—they told her something else.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And so, her hands started working at Rio’s belt, unbuckling it and sliding it free, while Rio's fingers danced along Agatha’s collarbone, leaving a trail of goosebumps in their wake.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She pulled back to look into Rio’s eyes again, looking for confirmation. When their eyes met, again, a grin appeared on Rio’s face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can I..?” Rio murmured, her fingertips dancing on the edges of Agatha’s blouse.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her fingers on Rio’s belt stalled. “Yeah,” she breathed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And so, her blouse was being unbuttoned, slowly, in an agonizingly controlled way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She looked attentively at Rio’s face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her eyes darkened with desire and Agatha felt ridiculous at the blush appearing in her cheeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s hands cupped her breasts over the lace bra Agatha was wearing, her thumbs brushing over peaks that were already so, so sensitive. The soft moan she let out filled the space even before she realized.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha.. God, you are so beautiful.” Rio sighed. Then, she laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Briefly, Agatha wondered what was so funny—but then: “The things you do to me, I-”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Show me, then.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s lips trailed kisses along Agatha’s neck, down to the valley between her breasts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       will
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      to show you. Want to make you feel so good.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's hands found their way on Rio’s back, exploring the smooth skin, her fingers tracing the lines of her spine. She felt the muscles in Rio’s back move under her fingertips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mhmm, you do?” she hummed, her voice breathless.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took off her shirt over her head, and Agatha wasn’t prepared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn’t wearing a bra.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The vision of her: her stomach, her breasts; the sight made her moan,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       again
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . Even louder this time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She felt the control slipping from her grasp. But the feeling wasn’t too bad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She let her hands roam freely, and she lifted her head to let her tongue trail slowly under Rio’s right breast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, when her hand softly palmed Rio’s left breast, she closed her lips around the right nipple, The moment elicited a sharp intake of breath from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio moaned, her fingers threading through Agatha’s hair as she sucked and teased her nipple.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then she let her hands explore again, caressing Rio’s sides, her fingertips dipping beneath the waistband of her pants.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Take them off,” Rio pleaded, her voice thick with need. “I want to feel your hands on my skin.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha obliged, eagerly unbuttoning Rio’s pants and sliding them down her legs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio kicked off her shoes, leaving her clad in barely anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha swallowed thickly, looking her up and down, but before she could say anything, Rio’s eyebrow raised in that insufferably attractive way. She didn’t need her words, this was clear enough.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And so, Agatha shed her own clothes until they were both clad in nothing but their desire.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio straddled Agatha’s hips, her hands braced on Agatha's shoulders. Her breasts brushed against Agatha’s, a movement that was incredibly soft.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I've dreamed of this,” Rio murmured. Her eyes were burning. “When I got back from Lola’s, I dreamed of you underneath me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The confession settled deep inside Agatha’s bones. “Oh?”, she breathed. She gripped Rio’s thighs, urging her closer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What happened next?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned down, capturing Agatha’s lips in a hungry kiss, her tongue exploring every crevice of Agatha’s mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her hips began to move in a slow rhythm, grinding against Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then—
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       fuck
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , she felt their wetness mingling through the thin fabric of their underwear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hands roamed over Rio's back, all the way down, squeezing and encouraging her movements. She could feel Rio's heat, and it was driving her absolutely wild.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Breaking the kiss, she husked, “I want to taste you, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The effect was immediate. Rio’s breath came in short gasps. “Oh, yes, fuck yes.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha flipped them over and guided Rio to lie back on the bed, her hands exploring her body more and more as she went.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She kissed her way down Rio’s neck, across her collarbone, and down to the swell of her breasts, sucking and teasing until Rio was writhing beneath her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Why did she have to be so
     </span>
<em>

       incredibly attractive?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s hands tangled in Agatha’s hair, urging her lower.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha trailed kisses down Rio's stomach, her tongue dipping into her navel, eliciting a sharp moan. She hooked her fingers under Rio's panties, slowly sliding them down her legs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, Rio.” Agatha murmured, her breath hot against Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wiggled her hips, lifting them off the bed, impatiently offering herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please,” she begged, her voice hoarse with need.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I like that—do it again?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even when Rio was like this, her eyes hazy and hungry, that challenging look still appeared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Please
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With a satisfied smile, Agatha positioned herself between Rio’s thighs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned down, her breath ghosting over Rio’s sensitive flesh, causing Rio to shudder and moan.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then she leaned in, her tongue darting out to taste Rio. The moan that followed was loud and desperate, Rio’s hands tangling in Agatha’s hair as she held her close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With a slow, deliberate motion, Agatha flicked her tongue over Rio, savoring the taste of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She teased Rio’s clit with the tip of her tongue, then sucked it into her mouth, flicking it with the tip of her tongue until Rio was gasping and moaning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's back arched off the bed, her hands clutching at the sheets.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, fuck,
     </span>
<span>
      Agatha
     </span>
<span>
      !
     </span>
<span>
      ” Rio cried out.
     </span>
     “Don’t you
     <em>
      dare
     </em>
     stop!”
    </p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha increased the pace, her tongue moving in quick, short strokes. She could feel Rio's climax building, her body tensing, and she knew it was close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She felt ber own body starting to tremble, too—Rio was so fucking
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       hot
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Please
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She slid a finger inside Rio, then two, curling them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please, I-”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s moans grew incoherent and louder, her hips bucking wildly as she rode Agatha’s fingers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could feel Rio’s orgasm building, could feel the tension in her muscles, the way her breath was coming in short, sharp gasps. She sucked harder, fucking Rio with her fingers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she came,
     </span>
<span>
      Rio's body convulsed, her back arching, and a cry of pleasure escaped her lips as wave after wave of pleasure washed over her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then, before she even noticed what was happening—Agatha’s own orgasm washed over her, causing her body to freeze completely, if only for a fraction of a second.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She gasped. She’d never come this easily before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She continued to lap at Rio, drawing out her orgasm, ignoring her own for now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s chest heaved as she tried to catch her breath. Agatha wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<span>
      You taste amazing,” she whispered, her eyes sparkling with satisfaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gasped, her eyes heavy-lidded with post-orgasmic bliss. “Fuck. Don’t get smug now but-”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She took a deep breath and Agatha felt something close to giddiness. “Mhm?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re really good at that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked, climbing up to straddle Rio’s hips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, my love” she said, her voice low and sultry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But I’m not done with you yet.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's eyes widened, her body already responding to Agatha's touch. “God, fuck. I don’t know if I..”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You can,” Agatha assured her, her voice a purr. “And you will.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And with that, she leaned down and kissed Rio, her tongue delving into Rio’s mouth as she ground her hips against Rio’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “By the way,” Rio breathed in her mouth. “Did you just-
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, guess I did.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Slowly, she slid two fingers inside Rio's wetness, her thumb seeking out her clit once more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A gasp. “That’s really… Hot.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked against her lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's body was still sensitive from her previous orgasm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She arched her back, her hips rising to meet Agatha's fingers, her breath coming in short, sharp breaths.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's fingers moved in a steady rhythm, her thumb circling Rio's clit with increasing pressure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That's it. Let go, Rio” she breathed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's body trembled, and Agatha felt her clench around her fingers once more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Agatha
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      " she cried out, her voice hoarse and raw. "Oh, fuck,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Fuck
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      !"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha loved the way Rio cursed. She loved how her usual cold and aloof way with words had completely vanished.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed her, swallowing her cries, their tongues entwining.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Rio's breathing slowed, Agatha withdrew her fingers, leaving Rio's body sated and satisfied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She traced Rio’s body with soft fingertips, slowly decreasing the sensations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, Rio pushed her back on the mattress.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But before she could hover over her, Agatha wrapped an arm around her and pressed her close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Remember, we have all the time…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha…” Rio just whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio,” Agatha answered, softly, her lips brushing against Rio's shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned around in her arms, facing her, her eyes dark, intense, and so full of something that completely made Agatha’s heart skip a beat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m afraid…. That I really, really like you,” Rio then breathed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha swallowed thickly. Another skipped beat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I am afraid the feeling’s mutual,” she whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha finally understood what people meant when they talked about butterflies in their stomach—or something equally ridiculous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But these weren’t just butterflies; it felt more as though a freight train was barreling through her entire being, leaving her breathless and electrified.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was terrifying.

<p>
<span>
      That morning, Rio woke up slowly, her senses piecing the world together bit by bit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A warm weight draped over her, soft and solid, and she blinked a few times to confirm she wasn’t dreaming.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Monday.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Pale beams of sunlight peeked under the curtains, casting gentle patterns on the rumpled sheets and the skin of Agatha’s bare shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, whose arm and leg were thrown possessively over Rio’s body, her face nuzzled into the crook of Rio’s neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, whose warm breath was teasing Rio’s collarbone in a way that was both ticklish and comforting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The last twenty-four hours had been a whirlwind, an overwhelming rush of emotion, but in the very best way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio could still feel the echoes of it all in her chest—a mix of disbelief and excitement that felt like it might burst out of her at any moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When her gaze shifted to the little clock on her nightstand, it read
     </span>
<b>
      10:00
     </b>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Not bad for someone who was currently unemployed and had no pressing obligations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But for Agatha? Miss CEO? It was probably catastrophic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned down to press a soft kiss on Agatha’s head. Then another on her cheek. Nothing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, it seemed, was a very deep sleeper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tried shaking her gently this time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Finally, Agatha stirred, mumbling groggily,
     </span>
<span>
      “Wha—what’s going on? Rio?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good morning, beautiful,” Rio whispered, planting another kiss on her cheek, this one lingering.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t freak out, but… it’s Monday morning. And it’s ten.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That did the trick.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat bolt upright, chaos immediately taking over her usually composed demeanor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh my God, no, no, no—"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was halfway out of the bed before she even realized where she was, fumbling around for her clothes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her hands flew to her hair, trying in vain to tame her wild waves.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I had this appointment at 9, and I—
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Fuck
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      !”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched the show from the bed, propped up on her elbows, equal parts amused and… mesmerized.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Agatha had finally located her pants and was in the process of wriggling into them, she paused, catching sight of Rio out of the corner of her eye.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Something shifted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her frantic motions stilled, and her gaze darkened, smoldering as it lingered on Rio’s tousled hair, her bare shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t bother buttoning her blouse.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With her pants on and her bra still showing, she crawled back onto the bed, her movements deliberate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The next thing Rio knew, Agatha was on top of her, kissing her deeply, hungrily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The taste of her, the feel of her so close, was intoxicating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Agatha finally pulled away, her lips hovering just inches from Rio’s, she smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We are
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       not
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      done with this yet.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s heart raced, her pulse pounding in her ears.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Giddy, and if she was honest, very much turned on again, she grinned up at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You better keep that promise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed, low and throaty, as she climbed off the bed to finish getting dressed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She moved quickly, grabbing her remaining belongings with a practiced efficiency, but there were cracks in her usual composed façade.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her blouse was still half-unbuttoned, her sunglasses perched crookedly on her head as she fumbled with her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched her, curiosity sparking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For someone who was so good at appearing perfectly put-together, Agatha was already showing these endearing little glimpses of imperfection.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It made Rio wonder—what else was beneath that exterior?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Agatha pulled on her coat, the phone pressed to her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, yeah, Billy, I know,” she was grumbling, one arm halfway into her coat sleeve.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry for putting you through that. I’m on my way now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned toward Rio, poking her head around the corner to offer one last wave.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And, Billy, I swear, I want no comments on—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of her sentence was lost as the front door clicked shut behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stared at the door for a long moment before letting out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She pulled the covers over her head, her face breaking into a grin so wide it almost hurt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The sheets still smelled of Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      An hour later, Rio finally settled at her desk, a faint smile still lingering on her lips from earlier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She opened her laptop, intending to work on her story, but it was almost impossible to focus.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She tried anyway, diving back into the world of Agnes, her grieving detective.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But it wasn’t long before Rio realized something: Agnes was beginning to take on the shape of someone else, someone familiar. The way she spoke, the way she carried her grief—it was all starting to resemble Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a soft laugh at herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As if she could focus on anything besides Agatha right now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The hours slipped by in a blur of typing, editing, and glancing at her phone more often than she cared to admit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Eventually, she turned her attention to her inbox, scanning for anything pressing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That’s when she saw it—a reply from Agatha, a reply to Rio’s mail that Billy had originally answered. Her name standing out like a beacon in the sea of emails.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That initial email felt so long ago already.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio clicked it open.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had answered every single one of her questions, leaving no loose ends, no lingering doubts. The responses were thorough and thoughtful, with a level of care that made Rio’s chest warm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was almost funny—this measured, professional tone was such a contrast to the Agatha she’d been with that morning.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That Agatha was soft and warm and chaotic, and full of disarming smiles. Yet this one was just as endearing, Rio was starting to see, in her own way.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned back in her chair, her grin widening. She appreciated the clarity, the sense of partnership it offered. If she was going to do this—which, of course,
      <em>
       she was
      </em>
      —then it had to feel right.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had her reservations about Agatha’s corporate way of going about things, sure, but maybe she was starting to realize something important: this wasn’t just any corporate venture. This was Agatha’s venture.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The two of them had worked out an arrangement that felt good.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio would have a say in the schedule and the freedom to pick someone else to help in the store—she was planning on asking Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The financial and administrative side of things would be handled seamlessly through PurpleBooks, freeing her to focus on what she loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It all felt practical, yes, but more than that, it felt like Agatha was building something that truly worked for both of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As if on cue, Rio’s phone buzzed on the desk. She glanced down, and her stomach did a happy little flip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s grin stretched even wider. That name—she really should change it to "Agatha," but...
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Seeing it made her think of the way their connection had started, the way it had grown into this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone buzzed again.
     </span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt the butterflies take flight again, their wings brushing against every corner of her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Dinner. With Agatha. And Nicky.
     </span>

<span>
      But, truthfully, it was the thought of seeing Agatha that made her feel like she was glowing from the inside out. It was ridiculous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wondered briefly how her presence would be explained to Nicky.
     </span>
<span>
      A friend? Something more?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Did it matter? Not really.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      What mattered was that Agatha wanted her there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio typed her reply with fingers that felt light and sure:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I would love to. and thank you for the mail—it’s a lot clearer in my head now.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She hit send and leaned back in her chair, her cheeks warm.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Four hours later, Rio found herself seated at Agatha’s dinner table, feeling a strange and unexpected sense of ease.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s apartment was nothing like Rio had imagined. She’d expected something coldly sophisticated—sharp lines, muted colors, the kind of place that looked more like a showroom than a home.
    </p>
<p>
     But she could have know that, instead, it was… warm. Inviting. Elegant, yes, but undeniably lived-in.
    </p>
<p>
     The living room, visible from the dining area, was framed by tall windows draped with sheer, cream-colored curtains that let the city lights outside twinkle through.
    </p>
<p>
     Plush, mismatched throw pillows lined the deep gray sectional, and a knit blanket—obviously handmade—was draped over the armrest.
    </p>
<p>
     Books were
     <em>
      everywhere
     </em>
     . Stacked on shelves, spread across the coffee table, even sitting in a neat pile on the floor beside an armchair upholstered in a rich purple.
    </p>
<p>
     The bookshelves themselves were built into the walls, their dark wood contrasting with the otherwise light and airy palette of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     A corner of the space was clearly Nicky’s: a small desk with art supplies scattered across it, a basket overflowing with action figures and building blocks tucked beside it. His energy seemed to spill into the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took it all in, feeling strangely at home in a space that was undeniably Agatha’s.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t just the apartment that was warm—it was everything about this moment.
    </p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky was sitting across from her, his eyes sparkling with the energy only an eight-year-old could maintain at this hour.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she’d first arrived, he had immediately taken her hand and insisted on giving her a grand tour of his room, explaining every Lego structure and book on his shelves with the detail of a seasoned guide.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Amidst them, were the ones they had bought that afternoon in
      <em>
       The Shop Around the Corner.
      </em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, trailing behind them, had shot Rio an apologetic smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, when Nicky’s attention wavered for just a moment, she leaned in and kissed Rio softly on the lips, a quick peck that left Rio feeling breathless.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Now, as they sat around the dinner table, Nicky was in his element, recounting his day at school and the adventures he’d had that afternoon with Sharon—his nanny, so he informed her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched him, fascinated by the boy’s animated expressions, and by how much he reminded her of Agatha—the same quick wit, the same warmth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It all felt so domestic.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom told me you’re writing a cool book,” Nicky said suddenly, turning to Rio with interest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blinked, caught off guard but grinning. “Well, yeah. It’s about a detective.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky’s eyes lit up. “Are you gonna read it as the Storybook Lady?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s gaze darted to Agatha, eyebrows raised.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Clearly, Nicky was well-informed. Agatha only shrugged, her lips twitching with amusement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t think it’s really… kid-appropriate, bud,” Rio said with a chuckle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But maybe I can give you a sort of outline later.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, cool!” Nicky grinned, clearly satisfied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s smile was soft, her eyes twinkling as she watched the exchange.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio caught the way Agatha’s gaze lingered on her, warm and steady, and it made her heart flip.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After dinner, when Rio offered to help with the dishes, Agatha shook her head and gently nudged her back into her chair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re our guest,” she said firmly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe, but you already made dinner,” Rio protested, starting to stack the plates anyway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed dramatically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio only grinned, carrying the dishes to the kitchen while Agatha followed close behind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Together, they moved around the space, Rio handing over plates and utensils while Agatha rinsed and stacked them in the dishwasher.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At one point, Agatha turned to grab a towel, and Rio took the opportunity to step closer, gently pressing her back against the counter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up, surprised, but her expression quickly softened as Rio leaned in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s so good to see you again,” Rio murmured, her voice low and warm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips curving into a playful smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Missed me that much today, did you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well,” Rio said, grinning mischievously, “like you said, we weren’t finished this morning, now were we?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a soft laugh, but it was cut short when Rio kissed her deeply, pulling their bodies closer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha melted into her, her hands sliding up Rio’s arms before settling at the nape of her neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, we weren’t,” Agatha murmured against her lips when they broke apart for air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her voice was breathy, her eyes half-lidded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I couldn’t stop thinking about you today, actually.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their kiss deepened, growing more heated, until—
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
      <em>
       Ahem
      </em>
      .”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They broke apart abruptly, turning to find Nicky standing in the doorway, arms crossed and one eyebrow raised in a way that was so uncannily Agatha that Rio almost laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, Nick,” Agatha said sheepishly, smoothing her hair as though she hadn’t just been thoroughly kissed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We got a little… distracted. Sorry.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky’s expression was unimpressed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You can do all that stuff when I’m in bed, okay? Do we have dessert?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t hold back her laugh this time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, clearly flustered, opened her mouth to respond but said nothing. Rio stepped in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I can make a mean chocolate milk,” she offered, glancing at Nicky. “Do you have cocoa?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah!” Nicky brightened immediately, darting past them to grab a tin of cocoa from the pantry.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Here—and milk’s in the fridge!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stepped back, shaking her head with a helpless smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I… will be waiting on the couch.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But before she left the kitchen, her hands lingered on the small of Rio’s back for a moment, warm and grounding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled after her before turning back to Nicky, who was already setting out mugs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alright, bud,” she said with a grin. “Let’s do this.”

<p>
      hello my loves!!! yes, a new chapter, it's true!
      <br/>
      a belated happy new year to you all &lt;3
     </p>
<p>
      aside from this, I have been thinking about aubrey a lot. I can't imagine what she is going through, and although rio is not aubrey, and vice versa, it still felt strange to write about a character she portrays.
     </p>
<p>
      that said—stories are always a beautiful escape of whatever we don't want to think about, so I hope this chapter (and the few that will follow) can offer that to both you and I.
     </p>
<p>
      oki oki, thank you for your patience and I hope you enjoy. x

<p>
<span>
      It was just past 9 p.m. when Agatha returned to the living room, her socked feet padding softly against the wooden floor. She’d finally coaxed Nicky into bed after a debate about why bedtime couldn't be endlessly extended. With a contented sigh, she stepped into the room, fully expecting to find Rio lounging on the couch, where she left her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But the couch was empty.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For a split second, panic fluttered in her chest. Surely Rio wouldn’t just leave? Agatha paused mid-step, her eyes darting toward the door as though expecting to find it ajar. But no, the door was locked, and Rio’s coat still hung on the rack by the wall.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned quickly, her eyes scanning the room, only to spot Rio standing in front of one of her towering bookshelves. Her posture was relaxed, but her focus was intent, as she trailed a finger along the spines of Agatha’s carefully arranged books. She tilted her head, studying one cover with quiet curiosity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The sight released all of Agatha’s tension in one rush.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “See anything you like?” Agatha asked, her voice soft but tinged with amusement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned, visibly startled for a moment before her lips curved into that smile—the one that was too casual to be practiced but too charming not to be dangerous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve got to hand it to you,” she said, gesturing toward the towering shelves, “you have impeccable taste.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked, crossing her arms and leaning casually against the door frame.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course I do. What did you expect?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio grinned, clearly unfazed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I mean it,” she said, gesturing toward the shelf. “Your collection’s impressive.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shrugged, feigning indifference, but the faintest blush warmed her cheeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know,” she said, stepping closer, “just because I own a monstrous company doesn’t mean my personal taste is bad.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, but still… I have to admit, I don’t quite understand how someone with
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       this
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      taste can treat books like—sorry to bring this back—but, cans of olives.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s smirk faltered, just slightly, and she straightened. “I don’t treat them like that,” she said, her tone a little cooler. “At least, not intentionally. It’s just... not everything can be intimate. Some things need scale, efficiency.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tilted her head, considering this. “Okay, but—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know what you’re going to say,” Agatha interrupted, holding up a hand. “I know I can’t replicate the same care and attention your shop gives its customers. Believe it or not, that’s something I admire about you. But,” she sighed, brushing a strand of hair from her face, “I’ve never been the nurturing type. Or for patience. It's just that I…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She trailed off, suddenly feeling self-conscious. Rio was watching her intently, and for a moment, Agatha felt unmoored. She pushed through, her voice firmer now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The truth is, I’ve always been drawn to grand things. Drama. Chaos. I don’t think I’m wired to work on a small scale or to be as giving as you are to your team. Maybe that makes my choices less ethical, but… I suppose I’ve never really let that stop me. And I know... That perhaps I should...”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio softened, stepping closer until they were only a few feet apart. “You might not think you’re nurturing, Agatha, or patient, but you are. You just have your own way of showing it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha blinked, startled by the sincerity in Rio’s voice. “Oh?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You are raising Nicky,” Rio continued, her tone gentle but unwavering. “And he is an amazing person. And for PurpleBooks—you built something enormous, sure, but you also fostered it. Your company wouldn’t be what it is without you. And as for me...” She trailed off, her gaze steady. “You didn’t have to write all those letters. But you did.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s throat tightened, an unfamiliar ache blooming in her chest. For a moment, she couldn’t find the words.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Somewhere deep inside her, she recognized a fear she hadn’t acknowledged until now—that still, somehow, Rio would be disappointed in her. That she was not reflecting what Rio found in her as DTWR.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio must have sensed her hesitation because she smiled, her thumbs brushing lightly over Agatha’s hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then she laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?” Agatha asked, her brows furrowing slightly in confusion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nothing,” Rio said, though her grin betrayed her amusement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s grin widened. “I’m just imagining you in the
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Shop Around the Corner.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Pacing around in those heels of yours, all impatient because you have no one to boss around.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out an exaggerated, offended gasp. “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Pardon
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took another step forward, her eyes crinkling with a teasing glint. “All that small talk? Yikes. You’d be yelling at customers for taking too long to decide between two paperbacks.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t yell,” Agatha countered, her lips twitching as if holding back a smile. “I simply... encourage decisiveness.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Encourage, huh?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before Agatha could retort, Rio reached out and brushed a strand of hair behind her ear, her touch lingering just long enough to make Agatha’s breath catch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’d still shop there,” Rio said softly, her voice losing its teasing edge.
     </span>
<span>
      “Even if you were bossy. Maybe especially then.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s gaze flicked to Agatha’s lips and back to her eyes, a faint blush creeping up her cheeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Making fun of me right to my face?” Agatha teased, her voice dropping to a low, playful warning. “You sure you want to test me, Vidal?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio swallowed, and Agatha saw the way her throat moved, the faint catch in her breath. “Always.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The way she said it, low and full of promise, sent a rush of heat through Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She felt the pull, her resolve teetering on the edge—but she wouldn’t give in yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead, she raised an eyebrow, smirking as she stepped even closer, their bodies now warm and flush together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Careful,” she said slowly. “You might just get what you’re asking for.” She curled her finger under Rio’s chin, tilting her head upward.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes darkened two shades. “Oh no,” she pouted playfully. “Poor me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's lips curled into a grin. She loved the game they were playing, she could lose herself in it for hours, but as they just established—Agatha Harkness did not care for patience.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And so, less than a minute later, they were curled up together again, spread out, their clothes half still on, half scattered around the floor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s back was on the couch and Agatha hovered over her, her hair almost forming a curtain around them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Regretting your decisions, Green?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's grin became even wider. "I don't know how bad the consequences are yet, so maybe I should push a little further, just to see?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio moved to kiss her, but Agatha pulled away. Rio drew another pout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And how are you going to do that?" Agatha asked, her voice hoarse.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I don't know, Ms. Dolphin Talking Whale Riddles. Perhaps I should further compliment you on your gentle sales skills? Or on the fact that you're secretly very sweet and cute?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed indignantly. She wanted to be anything but cute, and Rio
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       knew
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      that, too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Yet she felt her cheeks grow warm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Rio! That is… not true," she grumbled weakly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She forgot for a moment that she was trying to overpower Rio and suddenly felt her hands in her hair and her warm breath on her cheeks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I think it is, actually...  What are you going to do about that, Agatha?" Rio whispered the words in her ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her naked torso was warm under Agatha's hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Putting on a serious face, Agatha looked at her, then around the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "If you are a good girl and pick up your clothes from the floor, I will show you in my bedroom."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's eyes twinkled and she immediately jumped to her feet. Agatha remained seated for a second, admiring her body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Rio bent down and looked around her shoulder to catch Agatha's gaze, neither of them looked away.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<br/>
<span>
      As soon as Agatha had said the words
      <em>
       ‘good girl’,
      </em>
      Rio knew she was completely, utterly done for.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And it wasn't as though she was trying to hide it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha led the way down the softly lit hallway, her steps purposeful but light.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was transfixed by her, yet at the same time her gaze flickered to every detail she could absorb—the artwork on the walls, the slight creak of the wooden floorboards.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they passed Nicky's room, the gentle rise and fall of his breathing reached their ears, a reminder to keep their sounds low.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's bedroom was a sanctuary of soft lighting and plush furnishings.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And the books—oh, the books,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       again
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . They were everywhere.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Shelves lined two walls, their contents arranged with an organized chaos that reminded Rio of her own college dorm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Stacks teetered on the nightstands and the floor, some capped with mugs or stray pens.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A small tray on the dresser held silver jewelry, neatly arranged, and beside it, a framed photo of Nicky holding up a mud-covered frog, his grin infectious even through the glass.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was charmed by the chaotic, yet cozy feeling of the room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And here I thought you were in a rush,” Agatha teased, though her voice had softened, her breath hitching as Rio’s hand slid gently up her arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s gaze flickered to Agatha’s lips, her pulse quickening. “Who says I'm not?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For a moment, neither of them moved, the room around them falling silent as they lingered in each other’s proximity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha closed the distance, her hands landing on Rio’s hips and her lips curving into a sly smile. “Then you’d better brace yourself, Vidal,” she murmured, her voice low and inviting. “Because I don’t play fair.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It took only a little time for Agatha to completely mess Rio up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And so she found herself deep in the mattress, her body shaking as a second round of waves of pleasure rippled through her; Agatha's rewards for Rio being a
      <em>
       good girl
      </em>
      for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha swallowed her cries as Rio’s body was convulsing with pleasure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And at some point the teasing was over, and there was only a depth of feeling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A sensation they both took seriously—something that felt rare and already uniquely theirs. A sensation in which Agatha seemed to let go of her need to assert herself, and instead made room for a soft vulnerability.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A softness that allowed Rio to return the favor; to coax Agatha through her orgasms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a new vision of Agatha that Rio immediately loved: her head tilted back, a blush all the way to her chest. Her body that was shuddering, a gleam of tears that appeared in her blue eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio ran her fingers over her forehead, brushing her hair out of her face. She kissed her cheeks softly.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Some time later, when Rio's front was pressed to Agatha's side, as she was lazily tracing circles on Agatha’s hip, she finally asked:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What does DTWR stand for?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's eyes got a distant, cloudy quality, as though she were looking through Rio and into some far-off memory. A lazy, wistful smile tugged at her lips, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For a moment, she didn’t speak, and Rio didn’t push. She could see the delicate balance Agatha was navigating, the weight of whatever memory she was brushing up against. Finally, she broke the silence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Down The Windy Road.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tilted her head, curiosity lighting up her expression. “Oh?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s… it’s a song,” Agatha said, her voice faltering as she swallowed thickly, as though the words caught somewhere between her throat and her heart. “I made it up with Nicky. He…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her words hung in the air, unfinished, but Rio reached out instinctively, her lips pressing a gentle kiss to Agatha’s shoulder, grounding her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha exhaled shakily and pressed on.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He was sick when he was very young. His lungs…” She shook her head, as if to clear away the lingering shadows of fear. “It was bad. Scary for a while.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A lump rose in Rio’s throat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She couldn’t imagine what it must have been like to face something so terrifying, let alone on your own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had never mentioned it in her letters—not once. She hadn’t even mentioned Nicky at all until about a year ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m so sorry,” Rio said, her voice thick with emotion. “You know you could have told me, right? In a letter, I mean. I would have—” She broke off, unsure how to finish that  thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I couldn’t,” Agatha admitted quietly. “Writing to you was the one of the things that made me forget about that time. I didn’t want to ruin that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, her arms tightening around Agatha as if to make up for all the times Agatha had faced the world on her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a soft, almost self-deprecating laugh, the sound brittle but honest. “But yeah, we spent so much time outside. They said fresh air would help, and he just learned how to walk. We went to forests, swamps, anywhere. And on those walks, we made up a song.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her voice caught on the last word, but before Rio could say anything, Agatha began to sing. It was barely more than a whisper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Down, down, down the road.
      </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
       Down the wind-y road.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The melody was simple but haunting, and Rio felt it like a thread winding its way around her heart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Agatha stopped, her lips quirked into a wry smile. “There’s like two verses and everything. Maybe… maybe one day we’ll sing it together for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt her eyes burn, tears threatening to spill over. Her voice was unsteady when she finally managed to speak. “I’d love that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s gaze lifted to meet Rio’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, my love,” she whispered, her voice cracking as she leaned in to press a tender kiss to Rio’s lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe it was too soon to say it out loud, but they both felt it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I love you. I love you more than anything, than anyone.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s chest ached with the weight of it, with the warmth that threatened to consume her.

<p>
<span>
      Rio woke slowly, her mind dragging itself up from the depths of sleep. The pillow beneath her head smelled of something warm, something distinctly Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Right. Agatha’s bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She blinked up at the ceiling, resisting the urge to burrow deeper into the blankets. She exhaled, turning onto her side, fingertips brushing the empty space next to her. Cool. Of course.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was the kind of morning person Rio would never be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A deep sigh. Then, finally, she moved. She swung her legs over the edge of the bed, feet sinking into the plush rug before meeting the cool, unforgiving hardwood beyond.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Somewhere in the apartment, a floorboard creaked—an old, familiar sound. The air was thick with the scent of fresh coffee, warm and inviting, making it almost easy to pretend. Pretend that this was her life, as it had always been.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The kitchen was awash in soft morning light, golden ribbons stretching across polished countertops.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood at the counter, effortlessly composed, a study in deliberate precision. She wore a crisp blouse under a blazer that looked expensive in the way Agatha’s entire existence seemed expensive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even making coffee, she looked like she could command an army before breakfast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned against the doorway, watching.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned, catching Rio’s stare. A smile—small, knowing—curved her lips. "Morning, my love."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio huffed out a breath, scrubbing a hand through her sleep-mussed hair. "Morning."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Without a word, Agatha handed her a mug, their fingers grazing in the exchange. A barely-there touch, but enough.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You look like you’re thinking too hard,” Agatha observed, studying her over the rim of her own cup.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a sip, letting the warmth settle in her chest. "Maybe I am."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed, an amused sound. "Do you have plans today?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hesitated. "I should work on my manuscript."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good.” Agatha’s approval was swift, decisive. Then, softer: “Use the study upstairs. Lighting’s good. And before you protest—yes, that was an order."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio exhaled a quiet laugh. "You always this bossy in the morning?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Mornings are no exception, no."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then Agatha closed the distance and cupped her cheek, tilting her chin up with practiced ease. The kiss was slow, measured—just enough to steal the breath from Rio’s lungs, just enough to leave her unsteady.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Agatha pulled back, her thumb brushed against Rio’s jaw, a lingering touch. "Last night," she murmured, "was important."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio swallowed. "Yeah," she admitted, voice rough. "I know."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha studied her for a beat longer, then—just like that—stepped away, grabbing her bag.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Make yourself at home,” she said lightly. “Food’s in the fridge, ransack the pantry if you want. Nicky’s at school, and Sharon’s got him covered, so you’re free to loiter all day.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She paused at the door, gave Rio one last unreadable glance. Then she was gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The apartment settled into stillness, too quiet in her absence. Rio stared at the doorway, then down at her coffee, now cooling in her hands.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      By late afternoon, Rio sat at the desk upstairs, staring at the same sentence she’d written twenty minutes ago. Not every day could be a productive one, she figured.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She sighed, dropping her head onto the desk with a quiet thunk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, the sound of the front door opening downstairs made her jolt upright.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Voices filtered up—one warm and lilting, the other quick and eager.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hi, Sharon!” Nicky’s voice rang out, brimming with enthusiasm. “Did you see the butterfly? The one in the yard? It was so blue! Like, electric blue.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did, kiddo. It was gorgeous,” came the reply—patient, amused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio exhaled slowly. She had no reason to feel out of place—Agatha had practically ordered her to make herself at home. And yet, sitting alone in Agatha’s study while Agatha’s son walked through the door, Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that she was trespassing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Not literally. Just… in a life that wasn’t built with her in it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      More footsteps, then: “Let’s get you a snack before your mom gets home.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hesitated, then pushed back from the desk, closing her notebook. Avoiding them would only make it weirder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She descended the stairs, slow, deliberate, like she wasn’t overthinking this entire thing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky spotted her first, his face lighting up. "Rio! You stayed over?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio barely had time to process the question before the other voice—Sharon, she assumed—spoke up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, well,” the woman mused, turning toward her with an easy smile. She was older than Rio had expected, maybe late fifties, wearing a vibrant blouse and the kind of expression that said
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I know more than I let on.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      “You must be Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nice to meet you, Sharon.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon extended a hand, and Rio shook it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ve heard a lot about you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio arched a brow. "All complaints, I’m sure."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon’s smile widened. "Months of it."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked as the words sat in her chest.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Months.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned against the counter, watching as Sharon moved through the kitchen with practiced ease. Nicky chattered away, hands gesturing wildly. It was all so seamless.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And yet, Rio couldn’t stop thinking about how effortlessly they fit together. How she was the only piece that didn’t quite slot into place.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You alright, sweetheart?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blinked, realizing Sharon was watching her—not prying, not pushing, just seeing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah,” Rio said quickly, taking a sip of her now-lukewarm coffee. “Just thinking.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sharon’s knowing hum was quiet, but it wasn’t unkind. And somehow, that was worse.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had always been good at avoiding things.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Not the kind of running that involved gym class—she had too many embarrassing memories to prove otherwise—but the kind of running where she slipped away from commitments, dodged tough conversations, and disappeared just when things started getting too real. It was a skill she’d honed over the years, a survival tactic she’d perfected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So why was she still here?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She knew she loved Agatha. She was sure of it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t scary. But something began to feel heavier, like a dangling shoe ready to drop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Downstairs, the house had settled into its usual rhythm—the faint rustle of Sharon flipping through a magazine, the occasional clatter from the kitchen, and the steady ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall. It all felt so... stable. Normal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She let out a slow breath, rubbing her hands over her face. Maybe it was the house. Maybe it was the faint scent of Agatha’s perfume still clinging to the sweater Rio had borrowed. Or maybe it was the feeling that last night had changed something, and she was just waiting for the shift to catch up with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone buzzed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

<em>

</p>
<p>

      A short pause, then:
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Dull. Tell me something interesting.

</p>
<p>

      She tapped a finger against her chin.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hesitated, fingers hovering over the keys.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I’m wearing your sweater.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s reply was immediate.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       I know.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio swallowed, warmth creeping up her neck. How did Agatha manage to make two words feel like a challenge?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before she could spiral, a knock at the door made her jump. She turned just as Nicky peeked inside, his mop of dark hair barely visible over the threshold.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You busy?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio snapped her laptop shut. “Never.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Taking that as an invitation, Nicky bounded in, full of the boundless energy. He clambered onto the armchair across from her, his legs swinging as he studied her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sharon says you're book will be the best book ever written.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s the rumor.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think it will be super cool.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio considered this. “Depends on your definition of cool. No blue butterflies, though.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky made a face. “Then what’s the point?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She laughed. “Good question. I’ll work on that. It might be the first detective to feature a blue butterfly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Well,
      <em>
       that's
      </em>
      why it will be the best book ever!"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Satisfied, he sat back, studying her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you mom’s girlfriend?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio choked on absolutely nothing. “What?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky shrugged. “You stayed over. And she looks at you like you’re a puzzle she likes figuring out. You guys kiss a lot.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blinked. This kid was dangerous.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I... don’t know,” she admitted. Lying to kids was generally bad, but lying to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       this
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      kid felt impossible.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hm.” Nicky seemed to file that answer away. “I’m pretty sure you are. By the way, dinner is ready.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a breathless laugh. “I’ll be right there.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky scampered off, leaving Rio alone with the aftermath of his casually dropped bombshell.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her phone buzzed again.

      Ms. DTWR/Star Lady &lt;3:

<em>
<span>
       Still there?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Your son is terrifying.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A pause. Then:
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       What did he do?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Asked if I was your girlfriend. Zero subtlety.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A longer pause this time. Then:
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       And?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stared at the blinking cursor, that single-word question settling deep in her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Why was this making her so nervous? It was stupid, really. Not a big deal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Dinner was waiting, though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And so was Agatha; on Rio’s reply.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Rio did, in fact,
      <em>
       not
      </em>
      stay for dinner.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She told herself she would—she even made it as far as the kitchen, where Sharon was setting out plates and Nicky was recounting more of his day—but then the walls started closing in. It was subtle at first, like a too-tight sweater, a creeping sense of unease wrapping around her ribs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then Agatha texted again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Still deciding?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Two little words. Not a demand. Not even a challenge. Just a question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And suddenly, Rio couldn’t breathe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She mumbled something about needing air, ignored Sharon’s concerned glance, and slipped out the back door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By the time she got back to her apartment, she was exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with distance. She locked the door, climbed into bed, and stared at the ceiling. The phone vibrated once more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>

<em>
<span>
       I’ll wait.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned it over, screen-down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wasn’t sure she deserved that.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Morning light streamed through the half-closed blinds. Rio was curled up on her couch, her laptop balanced precariously on her knees. The words on the screen blurred together, her mind too crowded with everything she wasn’t dealing with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She hadn’t answered Agatha’s messages. Hadn’t even
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       looked
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      at them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The thought of facing her—of explaining why she’d bolted—made her stomach twist in knots.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The knock at the door was sharp, impatient.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio froze. Her doorbell had never even rung.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She barely had time to debate ignoring it before the door creaked open, and Agatha stepped inside like she owned the place. Her presence was an electric charge in the air, sharp eyes scanning Rio with the precision of someone who always knew exactly what they wanted—and wasn’t used to being denied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You didn’t answer your phone.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Again.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s voice was like a blade—cool, cutting, edged with something dangerous. Her lips pressed into a thin line, her posture rigid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shut her laptop with more force than necessary, irritation flaring.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       busy
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ,” she muttered, keeping her gaze averted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Busy
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       avoiding
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio clenched her jaw. “I just needed some
     </span>
<span>
      space
     </span>
<span>
      ."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a slow breath, then crossed her arms, tilting her head like she was trying to read between the lines. “Space? From what?
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       From me
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ? Right after I poured all of my heart out to you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s pulse kicked up a notch. She shot to her feet, heat rising to the surface. “You don’t understand
     </span>
<span>
      ,” she snapped. “This—this whole thing, your place, Nicky, Sharon,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       you
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      —I don’t know how to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       fit
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      into any of it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t flinch. She didn’t soften. Instead, she stepped forward, close enough that Rio could feel the warmth of her body, close enough that the air between them turned electric.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You think it’s too much?” Agatha’s voice was lower now, fierce and unrelenting. “You think I’m just going to let you disappear whenever it scares you? I thought you fought for what you cared about?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s breath hitched. Agatha was too close. Too solid. Too
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       real
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know what the fuck I’m supposed to be doing here,” Rio ground out, her voice breaking despite herself. “I don’t
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       know
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      how to be part of something that I love, something that actually—” She cut herself off, pressing her lips together, but the damage was done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words had slipped free.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyes darkened. She didn’t move away. If anything, she leaned in, her presence overwhelming, intoxicating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then we figure it out.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Together.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shook her head, but she didn’t back away. Couldn’t. Her body betrayed her, fingers twitching at her sides, aching to reach for something she shouldn’t.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha must have seen it, because her expression shifted. Her gaze flickered to Rio’s mouth, just for a fraction of a second, before locking back onto her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Daring her. Challenging her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s heart pounded. She should run. Should push Agatha away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But she loved her. She wanted her so badly, all the time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So instead, her hands, almost without thinking, found Agatha’s coat, fingers curling into the fabric like an anchor. Like she needed something solid to hold onto, even as everything inside her screamed
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       danger
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha exhaled, slow and measured, her hands brushing against Rio’s wrists, not holding—just
     </span>
<span>
      there
     </span>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And you fit perfectly,” Agatha murmured, her voice quiet but charged. “You don’t get to run anymore.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio swallowed hard, the heat between them dizzying. “Agatha—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No.” Agatha’s voice was softer now, but no less certain. “I’m not letting you hide. Not from me. Not from this.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt like she was standing on the edge of something vast, something that could swallow her whole. She had spent her entire life building walls, perfecting the art of slipping through cracks before anyone could get too close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But Agatha wasn’t leaving space for an escape.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her breath came short, her grip tightening before she even realized what she was doing. Agatha was too close, the air between them humming with something thick and impossible to ignore.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then, in one sharp, reckless motion, Rio closed the space.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her lips crashed against Agatha’s, desperate, messy, fueled by everything unsaid.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t hesitate. She met Rio’s fire with her own, hands sliding up to cup her face, pulling her closer, pressing their bodies together like she had no intention of letting go.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gasped against her mouth, fingers tangling in Agatha’s hair, the heat between them spiraling out of control. Agatha’s teeth scraped against her lower lip, and Rio let out a low, needy sound she hadn’t meant to make.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The kiss was all-consuming, raw and unrelenting, like neither of them could get enough. Agatha’s hands gripped Rio’s waist, pulling her in until there was no space left between them, until Rio could feel the frantic beat of Agatha’s heart against her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they finally broke apart, Rio was breathless, her lips tingling, her pulse thrumming wildly. Agatha rested her forehead against hers, their breaths mingling in the charged silence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You okay?” Agatha murmured, voice rough, teasing—but there was something softer beneath it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio exhaled shakily, her hands still clinging to Agatha’s coat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She tugged at Agatha’s blouse, peeling it away and letting her hands roam over the smooth, heated skin of her back. Rio pulled her in, pressing them together, the last traces of fear dissolving into something far more consuming—an ache, a hunger that refused to be ignored.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her breath was ragged, her pulse a steady drumbeat against Agatha’s own. Need coiled tight inside her, fierce and undeniable. She pressed a lingering kiss against Agatha’s jaw, then murmured against her skin, "Oh, and Agatha?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hummed, her fingers tracing slow, deliberate patterns along Rio’s spine. "Yes?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This time, Rio didn’t hesitate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She swallowed, then let herself fall. "Be my girlfriend."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stilled for just a fraction of a second—then she smiled against Rio’s lips, a wicked, knowing curve. "Took you long enough."

<p>
     The coffee shop, Alice and Rio’s regular meeting spot, was the kind of place that felt like home—worn armchairs, soft jazz in the background, and the comforting hum of conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat at the corner table, her coffee untouched, her mind racing. Across from her, Alice and Jen were locked in one of their usual arguments.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re missing the point,” Alice said, exasperated. “It’s not about realism; it’s about emotional catharsis.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen scoffed, stirring her espresso with a deliberate, almost aggressive slowness.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right. And emotional catharsis requires the protagonist to throw their entire life away for someone they’ve known for five minutes?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s eyes flashed. “It’s a metaphor, Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, my mistake.” Jen’s smile was sharp, almost taunting. “I keep forgetting you’re fluent in dramatic overreactions.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, glancing between them. Alice’s jaw was tight, and Jen’s fingers curled a little too tightly around her cup.
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, what the hell was this?
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could ask, Lilia swept in, all colorful scarves and chaotic curls, a bag slung over her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ladies!” she greeted, dropping into a seat with a theatrical sigh. “How I’ve missed you!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Chile looked amazing,” Rio said, standing to hug her.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia beamed. “It was. The Atacama Desert, the wine country, the penguins—utter magic.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought you’d never come back,” Alice teased, nudging a croissant toward her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please,” Lilia scoffed, waving a hand. “I wouldn’t miss this chaos for the world.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio settled back into her seat, fingers drumming lightly against her cup. The anticipation in her chest felt like it was about to explode.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have news,” she blurted, silencing the table.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice turned to her, grateful for the distraction. “Good news?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Very good news,” Rio confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well?” Lilia prompted, unwrapping her scarf as she leaned in. “Don’t keep us waiting.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a deep breath. “The Shop Around the Corner is reopening.”
    </p>
<p>
     The table erupted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!” Alice grabbed her hand. “That’s amazing!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, sweetheart!” Lilia added, bracelets jingling as she reached across to squeeze Rio’s arm. “I knew it wasn’t gone forever!”
    </p>
<p>
     Even Jen, whose skepticism was usually palpable, allowed herself a small, grudging smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I’m impressed. Who pulled the strings?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hesitated, glancing at Alice, who was—oh, she was
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     smirking now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha did,” Rio admitted, her voice steady.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen’s expression froze, her coffee cup hovering midair. “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The Harkness lady?” Lilia frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Rio confirmed, bracing herself. “She’s the one who bought the shop. And she decided to let me run it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen blinked. “Come again?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She didn’t have to, obviously,” Rio continued, her voice gaining momentum. “But she said she believed in the way I connected with the community. That the shop deserved someone who knew it inside out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia beamed, pride evident. “Of course it did.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But why would she do that?” Jen asked, suspicion lacing her tone. “What’s her angle?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hesitated, glancing at Alice, who was clearly fighting to suppress a smirk. “That’s… complicated.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, no, no, no,” Jen said, leaning forward. “You don’t get to drop a bomb like that and not explain.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed, running a hand through her hair.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, here’s the thing. You remember… DTWR? My pen pal?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen’s eyes narrowed. “Yeah…”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s her,” Rio said simply.
    </p>
<p>
     Dead silence.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Lilia finally said, her voice barely above a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s her,” Rio repeated, feeling her cheeks flush. “Agatha. She’s DTWR.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice, unable to contain herself any longer, let out a loud laugh. “I’ve been waiting for this moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen’s mouth opened and closed, utterly speechless for once.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait. The CEO of PurpleBooks has been secretly emailing you about... what? Books and bouquets of pencils?”
    </p>
<p>
     “And music,” Rio added helpfully.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jesus Christ,” Jen muttered, slumping back in her chair. “I need a drink.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it’s romantic,” Lilia declared, her tone decisive.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks, Lilia,” Rio said, grinning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Jen said slowly, her tone carefully measured. “Let’s set aside the whole secret-pen-pal thing for a second. Agatha might be smart, but she’s ruthless. She doesn’t just hand out favors. Once again—what’s her angle?”
    </p>
<p>
     “There is no angle,” Rio said firmly. “She believes in the shop and what it means to the community. And... she trusts me to keep it alive.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was still watching Jen, who still didn't look convinced. Jen, meanwhile, avoided looking at Alice entirely, taking another sip of her espresso like it might shield her from whatever was brewing between them. She leaned back in her chair with a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, if anyone can make it work, it’s you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio said, surprised by the unexpected support.
    </p>
<p>
     “So when’s the reopening?” Lilia asked, shifting the energy back to excitement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Two weeks from today,” Rio replied. “And I want all of you there. It wouldn’t feel right without you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course we’ll be there!” Alice said, already pulling out her phone. “What time? I’ll block out the whole day.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen groaned but didn’t argue. “I’ll come. Someone’s got to keep Alice in line.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice rolled her eyes. “Please, you
     <em>
      wish
     </em>
     you could keep me in line.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia, oblivious or perhaps just choosing not to comment, beamed. “And I wouldn’t miss it for the world. I’ll even bake something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not brownies,” Jen muttered, smirking. “Last time you made those, I thought I’d broken a tooth.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Excuse me, those brownies were chewy, not hard,” Lilia shot back, feigning offense.
    </p>
<p>
     The table dissolved into laughter, the kind that felt effortless and warm.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Agatha stood in the kitchen, absentmindedly stirring her tea as she watched the scene unfold in the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     She had intended to get some work done, or at least read a few emails, but the sound of laughter kept pulling her back to the present.
    </p>
<p>
     The warmth of it, the pure ease with which Rio and Nicky interacted, made it impossible to focus on anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio and Nicky sat cross-legged on the floor, a half-finished puzzle spread out between them.
    </p>
<p>
     It was an intricate cityscape—one of Nicky’s favorites—but tonight, it wasn’t about finishing the puzzle.
    </p>
<p>
     It was about the way Nicky kept trying to dramatically explain the ‘architectural importance’ of each piece, a skill he had clearly picked up from a documentary he’d been obsessed with last week.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, playing along, would nod with exaggerated seriousness, occasionally offering completely incorrect facts just to make Nicky argue with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You see, this tower is actually made entirely of spaghetti,” Rio said, holding up a piece that definitely did not look like pasta.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky scoffed, hands on his hips. “That doesn’t even make sense! That would never hold up in real life.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “Ah, but what if it was magic spaghetti? Ever thought about that, genius?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha covered her mouth to keep from laughing. Nicky rolled his eyes, but she could see the way he was biting back a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re impossible,” he said, shaking his head before turning back to the puzzle.
    </p>
<p>
     “And yet, here I am, in your home,
     <em>
      invited
     </em>
     ,” Rio teased, tapping a piece into place. “Guess you’re stuck with me now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt something deep in her chest pull tight. It was a strange thing, watching someone fit into your life so seamlessly. She had been cautious, hesitant even, about letting someone get too close to Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio had slipped in with the kind of ease that made it seem like she had always been here, kneeling on the floor, challenging Nicky’s eight-year-old logic with her own ridiculous arguments.
    </p>
<p>
     And now she was never going to let her go, obviously.
    </p>
<p>
     She found herself gripping her mug a little tighter, overwhelmed by how much she loved this—loved
     <em>
      them
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     As if sensing her watching, Rio turned and caught Agatha’s gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     Her grin softened, her expression shifting into something warmer.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, Ms. Harkness,” she called. “Wanna join, or are you just going to stand there being all mysterious?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, pretending to consider it. “Oh, I wouldn’t dare intrude on such serious architectural discussions.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s just scared she’ll lose to me,” Nicky said smugly. “Rio already lost twice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That is slander!” Rio shot back. “I
     <em>
      let
     </em>
     you win. It’s called being a gracious opponent.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a soft sigh and shook her head, walking over to settle on the couch. “I’m fine right here, thanks. But do continue—this is highly entertaining.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky beamed, and Rio shot her a wink before dramatically cracking her knuckles and focusing back on the puzzle.
    </p>
<p>
     A few moments passed in comfortable silence before Nicky turned to Rio with a curious expression. “Hey, Rio, do you know how to juggle?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked. “Uh. No, actually. Do
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky nodded proudly. “Yeah, Sharon taught me. But only with, like, small things. Wanna learn?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s face lit up in exaggerated enthusiasm. “Do I? Obviously.”
    </p>
<p>
     He scrambled to his feet and ran toward his toy box, rummaging through it before returning with three small beanbags. “Okay, so you start with just two, like this—” He tossed them up, catching them with ease. “Then you add the third one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio attempted to copy him, but as soon as she tried to throw the third one, all three dropped to the floor in a spectacularly uncoordinated display.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky howled with laughter. “That was
     <em>
      so bad
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio clutched her chest dramatically. “Wow. The betrayal. I thought you were my
     <em>
      teacher
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am! But you have to
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     listen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, now leaning against the armrest of the couch, watched the exchange with a kind of quiet amusement she rarely allowed herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, the juggling attempt dissolved into a mini pillow fight, and by the time they settled down, Nicky was curled up in Rio’s lap, yawning.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rose from her spot and walked over, brushing a hand over Nicky’s hair.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bedtime,” she murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky groaned but didn’t resist as she helped him up. He glanced sleepily at Rio. “Can we finish the puzzle tomorrow?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Obviously,” Rio said. “We still have to decide if the spaghetti tower is real.”
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The morning was crisp, with a gentle breeze carrying the scents of the city, mingling with the sweet aroma of fresh coffee wafting out of the café across the street.
    </p>
<p>
     The buzz of excitement filled the air around The Shop Around the Corner, and a long line of familiar faces had already gathered outside.
    </p>
<p>
     As the ribbon-cutting ceremony neared, Rio stood by the counter, trying to ignore the fluttering in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     The shop had never looked better—its storefront gleaming with a fresh coat of paint, shelves stacked with books, and soft lights casting a cozy glow over everything.
    </p>
<p>
     The first to arrive was Alice, predictably carrying two steaming takeout cups.
    </p>
<p>
     “I brought caffeine reinforcements,” she declared, sliding one across the counter.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look like you’re about to faint, and we can’t have that on your big day.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not fainting,” Rio replied, though her voice wavered. “Just… vibrating at an unhealthy frequency.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice smirked. “Completely normal. You’re allowed to be proud, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen arrived soon after, sliding her arm around Alice’s waist with practiced ease.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll admit it looks good,” she said, her tone begrudging but playful. “Even if it has the faint stink of PurpleBooks,” she winked.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice nudged her. “You are the one that worked there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did she tell you she barely slept last night?” Jen said to Rio, quirking an eyebrow at Alice. “Too busy making sure you had ‘optimal caffeine levels’ today.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shot her a look. “You’re just mad I didn’t get your order.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am personally victimized by that decision, yes,” Jen deadpanned, stealing a sip from Alice’s cup anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at them. “Are you guys still hard launching at one point, or are you just waiting until everyone notices?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Alice exchanged glances, before Alice grinned. “We are together. Boom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia entered just in time to witness the outburst, a delighted grin spreading across her face. “Oh my God. You
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     admitted it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice rolled her eyes. “Why does everyone act like this is such a big thing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because it
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     ,” Rio muttered. She and Agatha had been theorizing and making fun of them for a while—they
     <em>
      at least
     </em>
     deserved a proper confession.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could respond, a burst of chatter at the entrance signaled the arrival of Agatha and Billy, the latter carrying a clipboard and looking thoroughly amused.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha herself was dressed impeccably, her dark blazer sharp enough to cut glass, but her expression surprisingly soft as her gaze swept the shop.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes met Rio’s immediately, sparkling with affection.
    </p>
<p>
     A quick, almost imperceptible smile flickered across her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "You look right where you belong," Agatha said, her voice warm as she stepped closer, fingers brushing Rio’s.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy cleared his throat from behind them. “If you two are done with the romantic gestures,” he said, “we’ve got an audience.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot him a glare before stepping up to the front of the shop, taking her place at the makeshift podium for the opening speech.
    </p>
<p>
     As the crowd quieted, Rio felt the familiar presence of her friends surrounding her, each person in the room a crucial part of this story, this moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Jen stood close together, hands brushing as they tried to act casual.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia practically vibrated with excitement.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky stood next to Rio, his gaze darting between his mom and the stacks of books he was obviously itching to explore.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you all for being here today,” Agatha began, her voice carrying easily across the room, “and for being part of this incredible journey. The Shop Around the Corner is not just a business—it’s a community. It’s a place where stories are shared, friendships are made, and where every book on the shelf has the potential to change a life. This shop, the heart of this neighborhood, has a history that deserves to be celebrated, and I am honored to be part of its future.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paused and looked toward Rio, her voice softening.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve had the pleasure of seeing this shop through Rio’s eyes—through her passion for books, for this place, and for all of you. When I first met Rio, I didn’t expect that our paths would cross like this.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was true, in more ways everyone could know.
    </p>
<p>
     ”But over the months, I’ve come to admire not only her unwavering dedication to the store, but her kindness, her ability to make this place feel like home. I can’t think of a better person to run this shop.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I can’t think of anyone better to steal Rio’s heart,” Alice added softly, but audible enough to receive a few snickers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt her cheeks warming. Agatha, though, only smiled more, her gaze locking with Rio’s.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nudged Alice. “You’re one to talk, Miss Never Date Inside of the Friend Group.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me have my moment,” Alice whispered back, barely containing a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cleared her throat and suppressed a smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay. I should mention that this shop’s place in our larger community of bookstores is possible because The Shop Around the Corner is now part of PurpleBooks. We’ve come together, and together we’ll make this shop a place that continues to thrive for years to come.”
    </p>
<p>
     The bell above the door jingled again. Rio turned, and her eyes widened slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda Maximoff. Of course.
    </p>
<p>
     And she wasn’t alone.
    </p>
<p>
     Beside her, standing comfortably close, was a tall woman with long brown hair.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, this is going to be fun,” Jen whispered, barely containing her amusement as she nudged Alice, who only hummed in agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha barely missed a beat, her expression flickering for only a second before she continued.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anyway, I want to thank everyone who’s made this moment possible. From Billy and Alice and Jen and Lilia to the rest of our amazing team, to all of you for showing up today, I’m so proud of everything we’ve accomplished. I think we can all agree this is just the beginning.”
    </p>
<p>
     At that, Nicky piped up from Rio's side, his voice high and clear.
    </p>
<p>
     “And don’t forget—the cookies! Mom said there are lots of cookies!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew you’d remind me about the snacks,” Agatha said with a proud grin.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned to Rio then, who was still standing by the counter, smiling softly.
    </p>
<p>
     As the speech wrapped up, Wanda and the woman sauntered over, Wanda’s eyes twinkling with amusement. “Place looks good, Rio. Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda,” Rio said, nodding with a warm smile. “Didn’t expect to see you here.”
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't necessarily that Wanda was unwelcome. She was just.... Well, Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “I had to see it for myself,” Wanda said smoothly. “It might make a good article. This is Kate, by the way.”
    </p>
<p>
     Kate offered Rio and Agatha a friendly nod. “Wanda’s mentioned you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Has she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Kate grinned. “Oh yeah. You two really left an impression.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but laugh, the absurdity of the situation settling in.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked, finally relaxing, and leaned toward Rio. “Well, at least we know she stays true to her type.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can hear you,” Wanda deadpanned, though there was a glint of amusement in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     As the crowd slowly began to move toward the back for coffee and snacks, the space alive with conversation and laughter, Rio found herself standing next to Agatha, Nicky, and the rest of her friends.
    </p>
<p>
     The weight of the moment wasn’t lost on her—this was something that would stay with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, sensing the quiet shift in Rio’s mood, leaned in close, her breath warm against Rio’s ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m proud of you,” Agatha whispered, her voice low, full of soft admiration and affection.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s heart swelled at the words. She turned toward Agatha, meeting her eyes with a smile that felt like it came from somewhere deeper than just her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m proud of you,” she murmured back, her words wrapped in all the love and gratitude she felt.
    </p>
<p>
     It was as if everything they had gone through together had led to this moment—a beautiful, quiet kind of victory that needed no explanation.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky, oblivious to the tenderness between them, tugged excitedly on Agatha’s sleeve, his face lighting up with pure excitement. “Mom, Rio, what do you think is the biggest book in here? Can we look for it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile softened even further, her eyes crinkling at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     She crouched down a little to meet her son’s gaze. “Soon, sweetheart,” she said with a gentle laugh, brushing a stray curl from his face. “We’ll find the perfect one, I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     The bookstore buzzed with energy—the soft clink of coffee cups, the hum of voices exchanging stories, and the lighthearted laughter of people rediscovering the magic of a place they loved.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio stood there, feeling the warmth of Agatha’s hand just barely brushing against hers, she couldn’t help but think that the most beautiful stories were still to come.

<span>
      Central Park in the fall was practically showing off. Trees flaunted their red and gold leaves, their branches rustling softly in the crisp air. Couples wandered hand in hand, tourists paused for selfies near Bow Bridge, and a saxophonist’s smooth tune danced through the air.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Manhattan had a way of feeling almost too cinematic, too perfect. Across the park, the West Side bustled. Broadway sidewalks were crowded with gym-goers, shiny storefronts beckoned, and movie posters for superhero sequels no one had asked for loomed over passersby. Amid this chaos, delivery bikes weaved like a well-choreographed ballet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A little farther from the chaos, tucked in a sunlit brownstone, Rio Vidal stirred.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The bedroom was quiet, save for the faint hum of the city outside. The early morning light poured in through the windows, illuminating her stillness. Agatha had left early, her side of the bed cool but still faintly scented with her perfume. Work never seemed to rest for her, though she always left quietly, careful not to disturb Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Señor Scratchy, their rabbit, who ruled the apartment, dozed lazily in his corner on his purple embroidered pillow. Meanwhile, the bedroom bore the cozy chaos of Agatha’s, mixed with Rio’s creative life: books spilling from every corner, a desk cluttered with drafts of her almost-finished-manuscript, and a forgotten coffee cup that had been too far gone for salvaging last night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Rio finally stretched and rolled out of bed, she tugged on Agatha’s oversized T-shirt—one of her favorites—and padded to the kitchen. She reached for the espresso machine, which stood like a reliable sentinel. Moments later, cup in hand, she opened her laptop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A notification blinked on the screen:
     </span>
<b>
      You’ve got mail.
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The subject line made her smile: “Musings
     </span>
<b>
      .”
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       DTWR
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio clicked the message, already anticipating the thoughtful randomness of Agatha’s emails, little pockets of ideas and daydreams they shared during the day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This one read:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       "Don’t you just love New York in the fall? It makes me want to buy school supplies. If I didn’t already live with you, I’d send you a bouquet of newly sharpened pencils as an invitation to move in. Lucky me, huh? Billy says hi. I’ll bring home Thai for dinner.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled softly, typing back quickly:
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       "A bouquet of pencils and Thai food? You are a dream girl, Agatha."
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her fingers paused, and her gaze flickered toward the hallway just as she heard the sound of approaching footsteps.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio,” came Nicky’s voice, serious and filled with purpose.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The eleven-year-old strode in, his dark curls bouncing as he moved. “We need to talk about the dairy industry again.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good morning, Nicky,” Rio greeted, sipping her coffee.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good morning,” he replied, though his expression stayed intense. “Did you know—”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nick. I’ve been vegan for years. Chill, please. Like Scratch over here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky crossed his arms, unimpressed. “Scratchy has no idea of the world around him. Or homework. Or a Mamá who forgets to buy soy milk.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I bought soy milk last week!” Rio interjected, pretending to be wounded. “It was that super-organic, prebiotic thing you insisted on.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It ran out,” Nicky shot back matter-of-factly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fair enough,” Rio admitted, ruffling his curls. “And yes, you can help at the shop after school, as long as homework comes first.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A smile broke across his face. “Deal.”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      By late morning, Rio made her way downtown, the bustle of the city unfurling around her. She stopped at her usual coffee spot, where the barista greeted her with a knowing smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was already there, sunglasses perched on her nose and her pile of newspapers now neatly folded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hello, my darling,” Agatha said, her smile softening as Rio approached.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good morning, love” Rio replied, leaning in for a kiss. “How did your meeting go?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, thank you,” Agatha said. “I sent you an email about nothing much, really.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, I saw,” Rio said, a laugh in her voice. “I wrote you one back, matter of fact.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After a shared moment of quiet conversation, punctuated by smiles and gentle touches, Agatha leaned in again. “See you tonight. Don’t forget—Thai food.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yum,” Rio said, kissing her once more before they parted ways.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      On Columbus Avenue, The Shop Around the Corner shone like a beacon of warmth. Now part of PurpleBooks, the shop had grown into a thriving community hub, its charm intact despite the corporate association. Its front windows were framed with twinkle lights, stuffed animals posed with classic books like
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Goodnight Moon
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      and
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Where the Wild Things Are.
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen, waiting by the door, dressed in pink, grinned as Rio approached.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re late,” Jen teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I stopped to get coffee,” Rio said, unlocking the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You mean you stopped to see Agatha,” Jen countered, her grin widening. Her eyes flashed to her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Guilty,” Rio admitted, laughing. “But can I ask—who are
      <em>
       you
      </em>
      texting? A certain someone I know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen rolled her eyes, but the blush on her cheeks was unmistakable.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Inside, the shop hummed to life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen moved toward her usual spot at the counter, while Rio paused to take in the cozy space she’d built with Agatha’s support.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once again, the bookstore was her home away from home, in every way that mattered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s day officially began, the city moving around her, chaotic yet full of possibility.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Around 3, Nicky would arrive, eager to help around and tell her all about his day, probably.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And somewhere in her inbox, another email from DTWR waited.
