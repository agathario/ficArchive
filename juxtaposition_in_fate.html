<div class="userstuff">
<p>The place was halfway full, the smell of coffee brewing filling the air as the faint sound of the espresso machine whirred in the background. Alice, Jen, and Rio were huddled around a small table by the window, drinks already on the table while the women laughed at something.</p><p>Rio sipped her iced coffee through a straw, watching the passersby with the kind of lazy disinterest that masked deep amusement. She secretly loved people-watching. Jen had one leg tucked under her and was in the middle of recounting a Tinder date gone wrong when the door swung open with a dramatic clang, making the tiny bell above it rattle with its force.</p><p>Agatha Harkness strode in, her pace determined and sunglasses still on her face. She made a beeline for the table and dropped the ivory envelope onto the table like the small object had personally offended her.</p><p>“I’ve been summoned. To hell,” she announced.</p><p>No greeting. No preamble. Just that. Not that the girls weren’t used to her antics.</p><p>Alice picked up the envelope carefully, like it might burn her too. “Westview?”</p><p>Jen’s face turned into a squint. “Isn’t that where—”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha cut in, collapsing into her usual seat beside Rio with a dramatic sigh. She peeled off her sunglasses and tossed them onto the table, revealing her fury-filled eyes. “Wanda. She’s going to be there. Along with her <em> husband </em>. That bland cardboard cutout of a man she cheated on me with. The one she now shares a golden retriever and picket-fence house with.”</p><p>A beat of silence. Alice winced sympathetically. Jen muttered, “Damn.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t done. “Anyway. I refuse to go alone and look like a character from a sad indie movie who missed her last chance at love and now just fills her apartment with empty wine bottles. I will not be pitied by that town, that’s not the narrative I’m living.”</p><p>“You want us to… write you a new narrative?” Jen asked, suspicious.</p><p>“No, <em> sweetie </em>,” Agatha said with exaggerated patience. “I want one of you to be my girlfriend for the weekend.”</p><p>Alice choked on her latte. Jen blinked slowly.</p><p>“Fake, obviously. You’ll wear something hot, pretend to adore me, possibly make out with me if necessary—”</p><p>“Oh, <em> necessary </em>?” Jen raised a brow at Alice.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said flatly. “It’s a wedding. There will be dancing. There will be nosey relatives and questions and speeches. Someone’s going to make a toast. I might have to cry and pretend not to vomit. It needs to look real, public affection is non-negotiable.”</p><p>Alice leaned back, arms crossed. “So you want one of us to be your emotional support girlfriend for the weekend?”</p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha replied, with zero irony.</p><p>There was a long pause and then all eyes turned to Rio, who’d been silently sipping her iced coffee like she was watching a play unfold.</p><p>Her eyes widened comically. “Why is everyone looking at me?”</p><p>“You’re the only viable option,” Alice simply said with a shrug.</p><p>“What—why?” Rio stuttered.</p><p>“Please. No one would buy that Agatha and I are in love with each other,” Jen said. “I can only tolerate her for short periods of time.”</p><p>Agatha merely gave her the middle finger.</p><p>“What about you?” Rio said, motioning to Alice.</p><p>“No offense, but Agatha’s too high-maintenance. She’d probably make me color-coordinate.”</p><p>“She <em> will </em> do that,” Jen agreed.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t offended. She <em> did </em> have high standards. Sue her. “That’s called <em> aesthetic consistency. </em> I’m trying to win the breakup here.” Agatha replied.</p><p>“You’re trying to win against a woman who cheated on you five years ago,” Jen pointed out.</p><p>“Winning is eternal,” Agatha deadpanned. “So?” she said, expectantly, to the younger brunette.</p><p>Rio groaned. “You’re all insane.”</p><p>“Come on,” Agatha said, tilting her head, suddenly pouting sweetly.</p><p>Rio paused. Sighed. “This is a terrible idea.”</p><p>“I’ll owe you. I’ll feed your cat. I’ll let you pick the snacks for the road. You like drama—what’s more dramatic than fake-dating your hot friend in front of her ex?”</p><p>Jen muffled a laugh. “<em> You’ </em>re the hot friend?”</p><p>Agatha immediately groaned. “I meant, objectively, statistically, ugh.”</p><p>“I mean, you two already act like a married couple,” Alice added, eyes gleaming.</p><p>“We do <em> not,” </em> Rio and Agatha said in unison.</p><p>“You were saying?” Jen deadpanned.</p><p>Rio looked away, running a hand through her hair. “Fine,” she said, with a reluctant tone and a deep sigh.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes, I’ll do it. But I’m choosing our couple song.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “We need a couple song?”</p><p>Alice and Jen, without missing a beat: “Yes.”</p><p>Rio just grinned. “I’ll just create a shared playlist.”</p><hr/><p>They were twenty minutes out from Westview when the playlist looped back to the beginning for the third time and Agatha finally snapped.</p><p>“I swear to god, if I hear Taylor Swift one more time—”</p><p>Rio reached over and turned the volume up two notches, grinning to herself. “It’s <em> our </em>playlist, babe. This is bonding. We’re creating our lore here.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and dropped her head back against the seat. “This is a hate crime.”</p><p>The car was warm, the A/C humming gently as Agatha drove one-handed, her glasses perched low on her nose—something Rio thought looked <em> annoyingly </em> cute. Not that she was staring. She just happened to notice. Besides, what else was she supposed to do? She’d already put on the playlist, kicked off her shoes, and tucked her legs up on the passenger seat like she owned it. She’d tried singing along to the music, but Agatha had eventually groaned and asked her to <em> please </em> let her drive in peace before she ran them off the road on purpose.</p><p>So now she stared.</p><p>“I still think we should’ve practiced the kiss,” Rio said suddenly, like she was picking up a dropped conversation.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even flinch. “I’m not making out with you on the side of the interstate, Rio.”</p><p>“Not even for <em> accuracy </em>?”</p><p>“We’re not starring in a queer indie coming-of-age road movie. We’re in our late thirties already.”</p><p>Rio gasped, pressing a hand to her chest. “Speak for yourself, grandma. <em> I </em>happen to be thirty-three.”</p><p>Agatha turned just enough to level her with a glare. “Which isn’t as young as you wish it was.”</p><p>“Whatever. Point is, we should’ve planned the first kiss better.”</p><p>“We did. You said it was at Alice’s party. Three years ago. On the balcony. There was wine involved.”</p><p>“Right, but <em> what kind </em> of kiss?” Rio asked, gesturing with her hands. “Was it desperate? Playful? A sudden moment of realization? These are the details that make it believable.”</p><p>“Who the fuck is asking these questions?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. She just let out an exasperated huff and said, way too casually, “So was it me who kissed you first, or you?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. “Obviously me.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “You? Please. You’re too emotionally constipated to make the first move.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Like you’re any better. Besides, it’s obvious that I’m the one who wears the pants in this relationship.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “You’re obsessed with me.”</p><p>“I tolerate you.”</p><p>“You <em> lingered </em>, Agatha. That night on the balcony? You lingered.”</p><p>Agatha made a strangled sound. “You’re so dramatic.”</p><p>“You’re the one fake-dating me to win a breakup from half a decade ago.”</p><p>That shut her up.</p><p>They fell into a silence that was almost comfortable—if not for the faint, charged buzz between them, like static beneath skin. Rio turned her gaze to the window, watching the blur of green trees, the kind of landscape that grounded her.</p><p>After a while of contemplating, she broke the silence. Her voice was quieter now, like the volume of everything had been turned down.</p><p>“I think,” she said, “it was slow. Like we weren’t sure it was happening until it was. Like we couldn’t resist the pull bringing our mouths together. That kind of kiss.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. Her throat felt dry.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said, not quite meeting Rio’s eyes. “That tracks.”</p><p>The GPS pinged, announcing they were five minutes from the motel. Agatha exhaled, tapping the steering wheel with her fingers anxiously.</p><p>“You ready?” Rio asked, her voice gentle as she placed a hand on Agatha’s thigh. It was meant to be reassuring.</p><p>It wasn’t.</p><p>It sent a quiet shiver down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>She looked at Rio properly this time. The messy hair twisted up in a claw clip, the sunglasses perched on top of her head, the way her brown eyes radiated both warmth and chaos at the same time. Rio was annoyingly calm about all of this. Like she wasn’t about to walk into that viper’s nest of a town whilst pretending to be Agatha’s girlfriend.</p><p>“No,” Agatha muttered, smiling softly and refocusing her eyes on the road. “But I look hot and I’m holding a grudge. That’ll have to be enough.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “You’ll do great, babe.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the pet name, but she didn’t push her hand away. And she didn’t stop smiling, either.</p><p>They arrived at the only motel in Westview just as the sun dipped behind the horizon, casting shadows across the cracked asphalt lot. The neon sign buzzed weakly above them, the letters <em> MOTEL </em> flickering in and out like it was trying to spell something else entirely. Half the bulbs were dead. The other half made the place look vaguely cursed.</p><p>Rio stared out the window in something close to horror. “We’re staying… <em> here </em>?”</p><p>Agatha snorted, clearly enjoying herself as she threw the car into park. Rio slapped her thigh in mock anger.</p><p>Agatha shrugged, too pleased with herself to be helpful. “It’s the only place in town.”</p><p>“I guess nothing says <em> romantic weekend getaway </em> like a possibly haunted lodge.”</p><p>“Beggars, choosers,” Agatha said, swinging the driver’s door open and stepping out like this was the most normal setting in the world. Which, to her, having grown up in this town, it was.</p><p>Inside, the office was aggressively beige and it reeked of old air freshener and carpet cleaner. Behind the check-in counter, a woman with disinterested eyes looked up from her phone, blinking slowly as the bell above the door jingled.</p><p>Agatha approached with her usual confidence and slid her card across the counter. “Reservation under Harkness.”</p><p>The woman squinted. “Oh. Agatha, hey.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched. “Hi?”</p><p>The woman smiled like they were old friends. “We went to high school together.”</p><p>“Did we?” Agatha said, smiling to mask her confusion. </p><p>Rio, standing behind her, immediately started choking on laughter.</p><p>Agatha casually stepped on her foot with a pointed heel.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I guess I’m just tired from the drive,” she added, in fake sweetness.</p><p>The woman nodded sympathetically, then looked past Agatha. “Is this your…?”</p><p>“My girlfriend, yes. Rio,” Agatha said, gesturing to the other woman.</p><p>Rio smiled curtly. “Hi.”</p><p>The woman lit up with the enthusiasm of someone who lived for gossip. “Oh, I’m <em> so </em> glad you moved on. Well, I won’t keep you—room’s 2D, just down the hall.” She slid a single keycard across the counter.</p><p>Agatha took it with a tight nod and turned on her heel, heading for the hallway like she couldn’t get out of there fast enough.</p><p>They rolled their suitcases down a narrow corridor, the fluorescent lights above them buzzing dully. When they reached their room, Agatha slid the key into the lock and pushed the door open with ease.</p><p>Then immediately stopped dead.</p><p>Rio stepped up behind her, peering over her shoulder.</p><p>There it was.</p><p>One bed.</p><p>A single, very central, very queen-sized bed.</p><p>Agatha stared at it like it had personally betrayed her. “This is absurd. There must be a mistake.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You did book us into one room and called yourself my girlfriend. What did you expect? Separate cots like summer camp?”</p><p>“I don’t know, a couch. A cot. Anything.” Agatha snapped, still glaring at the mattress like it might sprout another one if she stared hard enough. “Ok, maybe I can go back out there and request another room.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorframe, smug. “And go back out there to who, exactly? That woman you just told we were desperately in love?”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. “Fuck.”</p><p>“Relax,” Rio said, brushing past her into the room. “It’s not like we’ve never shared a bed before.”</p><p>Agatha followed her inside, defeated. “Yeah, but that wasn’t—” She gestured vaguely at the room. “Whatever <em> this </em> is.”</p><p>With a groan, she moved toward the tiny dresser, beginning to unpack like she could distract herself with mundane tasks and forget about the mattress situation. But her hands hesitated, hovering above her open suitcase.</p><p>Rio watched her quietly, her smirk fading just a bit. “You okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said, too quickly. “Just—preparing to lie through my teeth for the next forty-eight hours and endure small talk with people who used to pray for my downfall. It’s going to be great.”</p><p>Rio shifted to sit cross-legged on the bed, bouncing lightly on the mattress. “Hey. We’re gonna crush it. You’ve got the hot girlfriend, the killer wardrobe, and a bone-deep need for vengeance. It’s a recipe for success.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, finally looking up. “Don’t make fun of me.”</p><p>“Oh, honey,” Rio said, smirking as she fell back dramatically against the pillows. “Where’s the fun in that?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her, but the corner of her mouth betrayed her, tugging up despite herself. She let out a breath and looked down at her suitcase again, still unmoving.</p><p>Outside, the motel sign kept buzzing, flickering in and out like it couldn’t decide if this was a romance or a horror movie.</p><p>Inside, it already felt like both.</p><hr/><p>The night had passed without incident. </p><p>Technically. </p><p>Sure, they’d woken up tangled in each other, but Agatha awoke first and pretended not to notice it. She’d disentangled herself with quiet precision, slipping out from under the weight of Rio’s body and padding toward the bathroom in silence. She only hoped Rio hadn’t noticed just how much of a cuddler she was in her sleep.</p><p>Agatha told herself it didn’t mean anything. People shifted in their sleep. It was natural. Harmless. But the truth was, her arm had been slung low across Rio’s waist like it belonged there, their legs braided together under the thin motel blanket, her face tucked into the curve of Rio’s neck, breathing her in. It was…too much. Too soft. Too easy.</p><p>Once she stood alone in the motel’s tiny bathroom, palms pressed to the counter, she stared at herself in the mirror with a scowl. She felt slightly pathetic. It was just fake dating. Just a favor. Friends helping friends. She could do this without making it weird. Or intimate. Or god forbid, vulnerable. Rio probably hadn’t even noticed. Agatha would keep it that way.</p><p>To Agatha’s good fortune, when she eventually emerged, towel-drying her hair and trying to look casual, she found Rio still curled under the covers, fast asleep under the sheets. The moment passed, and so did the morning, mostly uneventful.</p><p>The day followed in a similar rhythm. They walked the sleepy main street of Westview with takeaway coffee cups in hand, ducked into a couple of antique shops, and pretended to be interested in vintage salt shakers. Agatha pointed things out—her old school, the diner where she’d had her first kiss, the bookstore that used to be her favorite hiding spot—each mentioned with the offhand detachment of someone who’d tried very hard not to remember them. Rio listened, cracked a few jokes, tried not to press.</p><p>And slowly, something like ease bloomed between them again. Familiarity wrapped around them as they fell back into the roles they felt most comfortable in. They were used to each other’s company by now, they enjoyed it. The sarcasm, the bickering, the shared glances. It was all making sense again.</p><p>By the time they were back in their room, getting dressed for the rehearsal dinner, the air between them felt lighter.</p><p>Agatha stood in front of the mirror applying a dark lipstick to match her mauve dress. The fabric clung in the right places, accentuating her figure and dipping down low enough to show off a little cleavage, but not enough to be indecent. She looked classy and put together. Just what she was aiming for.</p><p>Behind her, Rio moved about the room, digging through her luggage with increasing frustration.</p><p>“That’s what you get for not unpacking,” Agatha said, glancing at her through the mirror.</p><p>“Do you want me to look good for you or not?” Rio shot back, holding up one strappy sandal like it was some sort of proof.</p><p>Agatha snorted, trying not to smudge her lipstick. “You’re exhausting.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.” Rio said, finally managing to lace up her strappy sandals and rising with a little spin. “How do I look?”</p><p>Agatha turned, eyes dragging up before she could stop herself. Rio looked…unfair. The silky navy dress complimented her skin tone beautifully while her hair cascaded down her shoulders. Her makeup was soft, mostly emphasizing her captivating dark eyes.</p><p>“Annoyingly good,” Agatha muttered, but her voice betrayed her appreciation.</p><p>The Uber ride was mostly quiet. They sat side by side in the backseat, and as the car turned down the street leading to the event hall, something in Agatha’s stomach began to twist. Not from fear exactly, as much as pressure. The kind that pressed against her ribs making it harder to breathe.</p><p>As they pulled up, the lights from the venue spilled out onto the pavement in golden streaks. Music pulsed through the walls. Laughter poured out the open door.</p><p>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s forearm, fingers curling tight.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said softly, concern flickering across her features.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond right away, her eyes locked on the entrance. “I don’t know if I can do this.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer with words. She just shifted closer, smoothing a hand onto Agatha’s waist with the ease of someone who had done so a thousand times.</p><p>“Together we can,” she said, low and steady. “Besides, you’re the hot, mysterious woman who came back with a stunning girlfriend to show off around town.”</p><p>Agatha snorted despite herself, but the tension hadn’t quite left her shoulders.</p><p>Rio leaned in, brushing her lips against Agatha’s cheek. It wasn’t overly intimate. But it <em> landed </em>.</p><p>“There,” Rio murmured against her skin. “Just trust me, okay?”</p><p>Agatha turned her head slowly, meeting Rio’s eyes. Something in her shifted. Not relaxed, exactly, but she could feel a sense of warmth spreading through her like wildfire. <em> She could do this. </em></p><p>“You’re very good at this,” she said, but it came out softer than intended. Almost accusing.</p><p>Rio smiled, bright and smug. “I know.”</p><p>And maybe that was the problem. Because it didn’t feel like acting—not really. Not when Rio’s fingers lingered on her waist. Not when her voice dropped to a dangerous tone as she reassured her. Not when the ghost of her lips remained on Agatha’s cheek like a tattoo burned into her skin.</p><p>Agatha straightened her spine and lifted her chin. “Let’s do this.”</p><p>But deep down, she didn’t really feel any braver. Just more aware.</p><p>Aware of the weight of Rio’s hand on her. Aware of the scent of her shampoo enveloping her senses. Aware of how <em> easy </em>it all had started to feel.</p><p>Of how none of this was supposed to be real… except it terrifyingly was.</p><p>The rehearsal dinner was already in full swing when they stepped inside. The lights were soft and the tables were dressed with centerpieces of greenery and white roses. Each and every detail curated to appear effortless.</p><p>Agatha moved through it all with poise, greeting old teachers, distant cousins, and childhood acquaintances with the right amount of warmth and distance. Each time, she introduced <em> her girlfriend </em>, Rio, beside her.</p><p><em> Rio… </em> Wonderful Rio who never left her side, smiling when she was supposed to, nodding in the right places, charming absolutely everyone she crossed paths with. But most importantly, she was <em> there. </em>Her fingers casually brushing against Agatha’s wrist, her back, her waist, like they belonged there. Her touch a silent reminder that they were in this together.</p><p>They were putting on one hell of a show.</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t help the way it didn’t feel like one at all.</p><p>Everything was going exceptionally fine.</p><p>Until it wasn’t.</p><p>The door opened again, and this time it was Wanda.</p><p>Agatha noticed her before she wanted to. That familiar high pitched laugh cutting through the room. She stood near the entryway, light catching the copper strands of her hair, her husband hovering politely beside her. Her dress was flattering, and every detail of her appearance was calculated to appear effortless. It worked. She looked infuriatingly composed.</p><p>Agatha froze for a second.</p><p>“Is that her?” Rio asked quietly.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha muttered, low and sharp, like the word left a bad taste in her mouth.</p><p>Before she could fully brace herself or even pretend to be busy, Wanda spotted her. That same curated smile curved her lips as she beelined toward them.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said, warm and rehearsed, like they'd just bumped into each other at brunch. “It’s <em> so </em> good to see you. You look good!”</p><p>“Wanda.” Agatha nodded once, smile tight. “You too.”</p><p>“It’s been <em> ages, </em> hasn’t it?” Wanda laughed again, all teeth. “Oh, but look at me, acting so rude. I don’t think we’ve met…” She turned to Rio, her eyes already doing the math.</p><p>“This is my girlfriend,” Agatha said immediately, already moving to slide an arm around Rio’s waist. Her grip was firm, possessive. “Rio.”</p><p>Rio offered a polite, measured smile and extended her hand. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Wanda shook it, her gaze flickering briefly between them, as if looking for a tell. “I’m happy for you both,” she said, in a tone that implied the opposite. “You make such a lovely couple.”</p><p>Agatha unconsciously pressed her fingers tighter to Rio’s side. “Thank you.”</p><p>For a second, the silence stretched. The familiar tension settling between them, as if carrying with it a history of wrongdoings and not enough apologies muttered.</p><p>“Right,” Wanda said finally. “I hope you’re enjoying being back. Westview truly hasn’t changed much.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, her voice cold and flat. “Some things don’t.”</p><p>Wanda’s smile slipped for just a second. Just a fraction. Then it was back, slightly less polished this time. “Well, I’ll leave you two to it. I’m sure I’ll see you both around tonight.”</p><p>She turned and walked off, her heels silent against the carpeted floor.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly. Like she’d been holding her breath the whole time.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything for a beat. Then, quietly, “She’s pretty…”</p><p>She didn’t know why she said it. Maybe just to name it. Maybe to gauge the reaction. But the truth was, Wanda was beautiful. That wasn’t the issue.</p><p>Agatha looked at her, narrowing her eyes slightly. “Good thing I brought the hottest date to this stupid party then.”</p><p>Rio blinked, lips parting in surprise before curling into a smile. A genuine one. She didn’t say anything, but something in her chest fluttered wildly.</p><p>They held each other’s gaze longer than they should have. Something warm passed between them, something heavy and quiet. Until Agatha cleared her throat and looked away.</p><p>“We should get a drink,” she said. “This night’s proving to be tougher than expected already.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “True.”</p><p>They laced their fingers together without thinking, hands finding each other with familiar ease, and made their way to the bar.</p><p>Two glasses of wine later, the noise of the room dimmed slightly, but not the heat pooling quietly between them.</p><p>It happened fast.</p><p>One minute they were sipping wine and dodging questions from Agatha’s great-aunt about when they were planning to have “a wedding of their own.” The next, they heard their names being called for some “official” photo book or whatever.</p><p>The photographer stood by the photo backdrop with the camera in hand while a few others hovered nearby, grins far too wide, laughing and urging them forward like this was all just harmless fun.</p><p>There was no real escape without causing a scene, and Agatha wasn’t admitting defeat just yet. So they went along with it.</p><p>They posed at first like any couple might: Rio’s arm possessively around Agatha’s waist, Agatha’s hand resting lightly at the small of Rio’s back. Smile. Flash. Another smile, this one a little more forced. Another flash.</p><p>“Come on,” someone called. “Give us a show! Kiss her!”</p><p>The crowd whooped.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio. Rio glanced back. There was a beat of stillness between them, both unsure of what to do, but very aware of the dozens of eyes waiting to be entertained.</p><p>Rio leaned in first, brushing a quick kiss to Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>But that wasn’t enough.</p><p>“Boo!” someone yelled. “We said kiss!”</p><p>At that moment, Agatha swore she wanted the earth to swallow her whole. But all eyes were on them, and Rio—sweet, chaotic, incredibly committed Rio—was already turning toward her with that usual mischief in her eyes.</p><p>“Guess we’ve got to sell it,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer out loud. She just swallowed, throat suddenly dry, and turned her face fully toward Rio. Her hand found Rio’s cheek, fingers gentle but firm, her palm warm against her skin.</p><p>Rio nodded almost imperceptibly, as if telling her it was okay. </p><p>And then Agatha kissed her.</p><p>It wasn’t meant to be much. Just enough to shut everyone up. A show. A second.</p><p>But it changed as soon as their mouths met.</p><p>Rio kissed her back with more pressure than expected, one hand sliding from Agatha’s waist to her hip with purpose, pulling her closer. Her lips were warm, impossibly soft, and Agatha felt her whole body react—her heart suddenly thudding painfully hard, her skin alive everywhere they touched.</p><p>She moved almost unconsciously, hands finding the back of Rio’s neck, curling into her hair, tugging her in like she couldn’t get her close enough. Agatha opened her mouth without meaning to, and the kiss deepened.</p><p>Rio gasped, quiet and wrecked, and Agatha felt the sound vibrate through her.</p><p>The kiss burned slow and deep, but it wasn’t frantic. It wasn’t rushed. It was consuming. The kind of kiss that made time slip away. That made it impossible to remember where they were or why it had started in the first place.</p><p>Agatha kissed her like she didn’t know where she was. Like she forgot it was fake. Like it wasn’t the first time.</p><p>Like it wouldn’t be the last.</p><p>Rio kissed her back like she’d been waiting to find out what Agatha tasted like since the second she first saw her. Like she would never get enough of her.</p><p>By the time they reluctantly pulled apart the room had erupted into applause, but it sounded far away, almost as if happening underwater.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat.</p><p>Rio’s lips were parted, red and a little kiss-swollen, her pupils blown wide. Her chest rose and fell fast and shallow, like she’d just run a freaking marathon.</p><p>They stared at each other but neither of them could utter a single word.</p><p>There was nothing to say that wouldn’t break whatever had just shifted between them. So they just stood there, caught in the moment of something neither of them could name yet. Of something raw and real and terrifyingly close to the surface.</p><p>And for the first time all night, the fake part of it was nowhere to be found.</p><p>And neither of them knew what the hell to do about it.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Morning came in slowly, the way it only does in small towns—with soft, golden sunrays shyly peeking through the thin curtains. The window was slightly cracked open and the cool, crisp air that slipped in jolted Rio awake.</p><p>She blinked slowly, adjusting to the quiet light of morning, and that’s when she noticed it.</p><p>The heat.</p><p>The contrast between the cold air and the warmth coming from Agatha’s thigh ,pressed <em> just right </em>between her legs, was maddening. Delicious, really, if she was being honest with herself. Her body registered it first, a low hum spreading from the spot where they were joined, before her mind could catch up and remember how they’d ended up like this.</p><p>Still, Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Agatha was fast asleep, her face turned toward Rio’s neck, her breath warm and slow, ghosting over her soft skin. One of her arms was tucked between them, fingers curled lightly against Rio’s ribs, while the other had ended up splayed on Rio’s hip, like she had every right to touch her that way. Possessive, even in her sleep.</p><p>Rio’s own arm had gone half-numb, trapped beneath Agatha’s neck, as if holding her in place. Still, she made no move. She couldn’t help it, really. She was too far gone, and her body seemed to want her to stay like this—cradling this woman while savoring this magnificent feeling.</p><p>Even now, hours later, Rio’s entire body was buzzing with the memory of last night.</p><p>
<em> Of that kiss. </em>
</p><p>After the applause and cheering had died down, they’d made their awkward, quiet retreat from the party in near silence. Not necessarily uncomfortable, but not entirely comfortable either. The whole thing felt too loaded. Both of them almost too aware of each other. Every stolen glance and unintentional brush of their arms feeling suddenly not-so-unintentional at all.</p><p>Back in the room, they’d changed clothes without daring to look at each other. No comments about Agatha’s choice of silky pajamas, or the fact that Rio had chosen to sleep in just an oversized t-shirt of her own. No teasing about how both of their lips still looked a bit kiss-swollen.</p><p>Just plain old silence. Unspoken tension seemingly shrinking the walls of their shared room until they had no choice but to collapse into bed, each on their side, staring at the ceiling like they were scared of what might happen if they even spared each other a single glance.</p><p>And then, somewhere in the night, they’d drifted toward one another.</p><p>That’s how they’d ended up with Agatha draped over Rio like she was claiming her, awaking in the younger woman a raw, aching feeling in her chest.</p><p>Agatha shifted then, a small groan escaping her lips, and Rio felt it vibrate against her skin. Her brow furrowed ever-so-slightly, lips parting in her sleep as she murmured something unintelligible, too soft to hear. The tension in her face told Rio that whatever she was dreaming about wasn’t soft.</p><p>It was undeniably darker.</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened at the sight, and she couldn’t help but wonder if maybe the older woman was dreaming about her. Maybe it was just wishful thinking, but all the same, she couldn’t shake the thought out of her brain.</p><p>She’d seen Agatha flustered. Sarcastic. Cold. She’d seen her cornered and trying to play it cool, always desperate to maintain the upper hand.</p><p>But she had never seen this.</p><p>And <em> god, </em> this version of Agatha—barefaced, curled into her, trusting—was doing things to her. Things Rio had always tried not to think too hard about. Things her brain had spent years trying to ignore, yet her body recognized all the same.</p><p>Sure, she knew Agatha was hot. She’d be an idiot not to notice. Not only was Agatha incredibly gorgeous, with those baby-blue eyes and wild, dark locks, but she was also confident and magnetic. The kind of woman who could draw an entire room’s attention the moment she stepped into it.</p><p>Rio had flirted with her before. She’d made some crude jokes. But it had never been more than a game. She had never allowed it to be.</p><p>Agatha’s body shifted again, thigh brushing more firmly against her center, and Rio bit her lip. Her body was buzzing now, her mind spinning. She should’ve moved. She knew she should’ve moved. Should’ve untangled her arm from behind her and put some distance between them before the lines blurred even more than they already did.</p><p>And yet, her body seemed to be acting of its own accord, her hand moving before she could stop it until it was dragging softly down Agatha’s back. It was nothing more than a simple caress, just enough to satisfy the ache in her chest to feel the curve of her spine beneath the fabric of her nightgown.</p><p>She exhaled shakily, fingers climbing higher to brush through her hair. <em> God, she loved her hair. </em>Loved how wild it always looked, how it smelled faintly of something both spicy and sweet.</p><p>Her touch grew bolder, just slightly. Thumb tracing small circles just above the hem of Agatha’s nightgown, right where skin met fabric. It wasn’t much. It shouldn’t have meant anything.</p><p>And yet it felt like everything. Like she was touching the sky with her bare hands.</p><p>And then—</p><p>Agatha stirred.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Time stood still as Agatha slowly blinked her eyes open, disoriented at first, like she couldn't quite place where she was. Until their eyes met.</p><p>Their faces were mere inches apart, their bodies even closer.</p><p>Rio didn’t move. Couldn't. Her mind too clouded by how unfairly pretty Agatha looked, even with sleep still ghosting over her features.</p><p>Agatha just stared at her for a moment longer than she should have. Her breath hitching ever so slightly, and Rio could swear she felt it against her lips.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said, voice rough and low, like she hadn’t been expecting Rio to be awake. Or staring at her.</p><p>Rio swallowed, half expecting the other woman to immediately pull away. “Morning.”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t move. She just stayed there. Staring. Breathing.</p><p>And suddenly, the air between them felt heavy once again, thick with the same unspoken tension that had been haunting them since last night. Of that same magnetic pull that kept drawing them closer, making it almost impossible to think, to breathe.</p><p>And this time, neither of them could pretend they didn’t feel it.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Except… they did.</p><p>With awkward smiles and shy eyes that wouldn’t quite meet, they eventually untangled themselves and got up. They dressed in silence, careful not to let their gazes linger, pretending they weren’t thinking about how their thighs had felt pressed together or the way their breaths had mingled, begging them to close the gap once more.</p><p>Pretending they hadn’t woken up wrapped around each other like it was the most intimate, ancient ritual of their everyday routine.</p><p>They left for breakfast shortly after. A coffee date.</p><p>No—not a <em> date. </em></p><p>But the way Agatha’s hand had lingered on the small of Rio’s back, warm and steady as she guided her inside the café, had made it feel like one. Or maybe it was the way Rio kept cracking jokes just to watch Agatha throw her head back in laughter, exposing her throat. And maybe it was the way Rio looked at her then, hungry and ready to reach out, just to <em> feel </em>her again.</p><p>They spent the afternoon exploring Westview’s tiny main street, stopping by the only flower shop in town, where Rio spent far too long choosing the perfect plants to bring back to her apartment. Agatha rolled her eyes, but they both knew it was just for show. It was obvious in the way she kept smirking every time Rio held up a new pot and gazed at her with those big brown eyes, asking for her opinion like it mattered more than anything else.</p><p>Once Rio was finally satisfied with the amount of plants acquired, they decided to share an ice cream cone. Out of convenience, of course. Because it was hot, and they didn’t feel like ordering two.</p><p>At least, that’s what they told themselves.</p><p>They looked like a couple.</p><p>And not a fake one.</p><p>They moved through town like they belonged together. Like they’d always belonged. They talked. Walked. Laughed until their stomachs hurt. And yet—</p><p>Neither of them mentioned the kiss.</p><p>Neither mentioned the bed.</p><p>Neither spoke of how Rio’s hand had skimmed over Agatha’s spine that morning, or how Agatha’s thigh had remained between Rio’s long after they’d both woken up.</p><p>But they didn’t have to.</p><p>It was there, humming between them. In every brush of skin, every glance held too long, every sentence that trailed off because the truth was suddenly too close to the surface, threatening to spill out.</p><p>By the time they got back to the motel, Rio’s heart was thudding like it wanted out of her chest. The ache that had started somewhere beneath her ribs was now spreading freely throughout her body hot and insistent, impossible to ignore.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t saying a word either. But her hands had been clenched in fists all day. She kept tucking her hair behind her ears. Kept biting the inside of her cheek like something was burning her insides and she didn’t know how much longer she could keep it down.</p><p>Rio wondered if the wanting was killing her too.</p><p>She almost asked.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>All they knew was that whatever <em> this </em> was—it couldn’t go much longer without snapping.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hours later, they stepped into the reception hall side by side.</p><p>It felt strange, going on with the pretense after everything that had shifted between them. Sure, the world hadn’t exploded, but something had undeniably cracked open, making room for something that felt dangerously real.</p><p>They hadn’t touched since that morning. Not really. But it was still there, simmering under the surface. Ready to burst.</p><p>When Agatha felt Rio’s fingers brush against hers, deliberate and grounding, she was immediately brought back to reality, exhaling a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.</p><p>The touch should’ve been harmless. Should’ve been innocent. Nothing more than a reassuring brush of hands.</p><p>It wasn’t.</p><p>Not if the jolt that shot through her was any indication.</p><p>Both of them felt it, like their nerves had been starving for contact all day, and now, even the smallest touch was too much.</p><p>The tension had only grown, building at an uncontrollable pace. Now only heightening at the sight of each other in their wedding guest dresses.</p><p>
<em> Agatha had nearly stumbled. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She didn’t even try to hide it. Her gaze dropped immediately, heavy and unhurried. She trailed her eyes over Rio’s collarbones, then lower—to the soft swell of her chest, the defined cut of her waist, the length of her well-defined arms. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The pale blue dress she wore was simple, strapless, elegant. But Agatha still felt like she was drowning in it. Or maybe in her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She went still, lips parting just slightly, and for a moment, it looked like she might actually groan out loud. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She didn’t say a word. Of course she didn’t. But Rio saw everything. The widening of her eyes, the clench of her jaw, the way her gaze dragged across her body like she was trying to memorize every inch. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She looked hungry. Desperate. </em>
</p><p>
<em> And Rio? Rio hadn’t fared much better. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Because Agatha looked straight up like sin. Like a woman born to be stared at, desired, devoured. Her dress was the color of fresh espresso, warm and dark and utterly tempting. The halter neckline hugged her shoulders just right, and the way it left her arms bare was already enough to make Rio's fingers itch. </em>
</p><p>
<em> But the best part? The back. God, the back was criminal. The way the fabric dipped low enough to tease but stopped just above the waist, exposing smooth skin, was definitely enough to drive Rio insane. </em>
</p><p>
<em> It was tasteful, sure. Refined, even. But Rio could only picture hands—her hands—on every inch of that skin. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her mind short-circuited. For a full ten seconds, she didn’t blink. Her mouth went dry. Her thoughts turned instantly explicit. All she could picture was pressing Agatha against the nearest wall, dragging her hands over that bare back while licking a slow path down her spine. She wanted to feel that skin under her tongue. She wanted to know what sound Agatha would make if she bit down, just a little. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her fingers twitched at her side, dangerously close to giving her away. Her whole body was buzzing with so much want she thought she might combust just from looking at her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She was so fucked. </em>
</p><p>Instead of doing anything about it — about the want pulsing between them, about the way Rio’s eyes kept trailing down Agatha’s back like she had every right to — they called an Uber and went to the goddamn wedding.</p><p>The reception hall was already glowing when they arrived, warm with light and music and the low buzz of too many people talking at once. No one paid them much attention as they made a beeline for the bar, both feeling like they’d earned a drink. Or a few.</p><p>They danced. At first reluctantly, unsure of what to do with all the heat crackling between them, or how to pretend everything was normal while being forced to touch in public.</p><p>But, eventually, they found an easy rhythm that surprised them both. Maybe it was the alcohol. Maybe it was muscle memory. Maybe it was that being close finally felt more right than staying apart.</p><p>As a particular slow song began blasting through the speakers, Agatha’s hand found Rio’s waist, firm and demanding as she guided them. It all felt incredibly familiar. Like this wasn’t the first time they’d done this. Like their bodies already knew their way around each other.</p><p>Rio didn’t mind. It gave her an excuse to lean in, to breathe her in, to close her eyes and pretend—even if for the length of the song—that Agatha was hers.</p><p>Agatha held her breath, but didn’t pull away. Didn’t speak. She just held her. Let Rio stay close. Her thumb began to brush lazy, absentminded circles against the soft fabric of Rio’s dress, like she didn’t even realize she was doing it.</p><p>Neither of them pulled away when the music changed. They weren’t even sure they noticed.</p><p>They laughed, too. At Agatha’s cousin’s dance moves. At the corny wedding playlist. At her nosy aunts insisting they made a <em> beautiful </em> couple.</p><p>Which, truth be told, they did.</p><p>They were glowing. Maybe from the fairy lights. Maybe from the champagne. Maybe from the steady, electric heat that seemed to spark every time they brushed against each other, every shared glance, every private joke told between mouths that were too close.</p><p>Or maybe it wasn’t accidental at all.</p><p>Because every time Rio touched Agatha’s arm—whether to steady her, or brush lint off her shoulder, or just because she couldn’t help herself—she could feel it: the slight twitch of muscle, the way Agatha went still for half a breath too long before relaxing again.</p><p>And every time Agatha leaned in to whisper something—too close, too low, her breath ghosting along Rio’s skin—Rio had to resist the urge to bite her lip.</p><p>The urge to bite <em> hers </em>.</p><p>She looked at Agatha during dinner, sometime between the fourth glass of champagne and the groom’s teary toast, and found her already watching. Chin propped on one hand, eyes dark and unreadable. Her mouth parted like she was about to say something. But she didn’t.</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened. Her fingers clenched around her wine glass.</p><p>She looked away first.</p><p>They were walking the edge now. One step and they’d fall.</p><p>But somehow, they weren’t scared. Not anymore.</p><p>Because every second that passed without touching again felt unbearable. Because they kept reaching for each other—for the safety of a shared laugh, the comfort of a familiar hand on a thigh, the excuse of a whisper too close—like they couldn’t stop.</p><p>And maybe they didn’t want to.</p><p>When someone called for all couples to return to the dance floor, Rio didn’t even hesitate. Her hand found Agatha’s without thinking.</p><p>She wasn’t sure if it was still part of the performance or if it was something else entirely. Didn’t care.</p><p>Agatha took it wordlessly and they made their way toward the haze of fairy lights and low, vintage music.</p><p>Her hand returned to Rio’s waist. Their bodies aligned like they were pieces of the same puzzle. Like it was impossible for them to part.</p><p>This time, Rio didn’t look away. She let her fingers rest just above the curve of Agatha’s hip, let her thumb trace slow circles over the silky fabric of her dress.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched and her eyes fluttered shut.</p><p>Rio leaned in. “You okay?” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha smiled. Barely. “Trying not to ruin this wedding.”</p><p>“You’re doing a terrible job,” Rio said, voice low, teasing, but her fingers tightened in a comforting manner.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes again. Her gaze dropped to Rio’s mouth.</p><p>And lingered.</p><p>They didn’t kiss. Not yet.</p><p>But they <em> wanted </em>to.</p><p>They were so close.</p><p>It was just a matter of time at this point.</p><p>And then someone started clinking their glass with a fork. The sharp, cheerful sound of impending speeches.</p><p>And just like that, the moment broke.</p><p>Agatha immediately stiffened, unsure as to how to react with the tension that had been building with Rio, which now seemed to be reaching a point of no return. She felt so many things for the woman, but was she really willing to risk it all for a relationship with her?</p><p>Rio noticed the change in her immediately and gave her hip a light squeeze. Agatha blinked, as if remembering she was still there. She offered a tight smile, and Rio’s chest ached at how unconvincing it was.</p><p>“I’ll get us another drink,” Rio murmured, moving before Agatha could argue.</p><p>Agatha nodded, grateful, but the second Rio turned away, she exhaled too hard, like she’d been holding in something more than just her breath. She stepped toward the edge of the room, removing herself from the center of the dance floor, looking for a quiet spot away from the noise and watching eyes.</p><p>She didn’t get the chance.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Her entire body froze. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was. That voice was etched into the back of her skull.</p><p>When she finally turned, Wanda was already far too close.</p><p>She looked beautiful. She always had. But now, Agatha couldn’t help but compare her to her beautiful date, who seemed to bring the light into every room she walked into.</p><p>“I was wondering when I’d get the chance to talk to you,” Wanda said, wearing a practiced smile. Her eyes flickered once over Agatha’s dress, obvious and lingering. “I couldn’t help but notice how… devastating you look.”</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha said, voice low but firm.</p><p>Wanda tilted her head. “Don’t what?”</p><p>“Don’t do this.”</p><p>“Do what? Compliment you?” Wanda’s tone was falsely innocent. Her hand moved to softly touch Agatha’s arm. “We both know how good we were together…”</p><p>Agatha stepped back. “We were never good.”</p><p>“That’s not what you used to say-”</p><p>“You cheated on me,” she snapped, too loud. Heads turned. She didn’t care. “You don’t get to play the nostalgia card just because you saw me here with someone else.”</p><p>Wanda’s smile faltered. “So it’s real then,” she said, gaze shifting toward the bar, where Rio had gone. “The girlfriend. She’s not only here to make me jealous?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darkened. “I don’t give a fuck about making you jealous. I’m in love with her.”</p><p>And suddenly, it hit her. It wasn’t a performance, it wasn’t a line. It was the truth.</p><p>Wanda blinked, momentarily thrown. She inched closer, hand lifting to brush through Agatha’s hair. “Come on, you don’t really believe that.”</p><p>“I’m not you,” Agatha added, quieter now, but sharper than ever. “I’m not a cheater. And I would have to be out of my mind to <em> ever </em>hurt her.”</p><p>The air crackled between them.</p><p>And then, unseen by Agatha, Rio stepped back into the room, two drinks in hand, scanning the crowd for her.</p><p>Her eyes found her almost instantly.</p><p>Agatha. With Wanda. </p><p>From Rio’s angle, it looked bad. Wanda leaning in, touching<em> definitely-fake gf’s </em>hair. Agatha’s expression was unreadable but you could tell they were passionately discussing something. There was no way to hear the words but the heat in the air was unmistakable.</p><p>It looked like <em> everything </em>Rio had quietly feared might still live in the space between them.</p><p>Her throat closed up. The glasses in her hands suddenly felt heavy, useless. She stood frozen for a moment, caught mid-step like her body couldn’t decide whether to fight or flee.</p><p>And then, Agatha saw her.</p><p>The moment their eyes met, Rio couldn’t take it anymore. The pain was almost unbearable.</p><p>So she made her choice. She ran.</p><p>Agatha’s heart stopped.</p><p>She took a step forward, then another, trying to weave through the crowd, trying to catch her, call out, explain. But Rio was already gone, swallowed by the party, the music, the damn speeches.</p><p>Wanda followed closely behind and grabbed her arm.</p><p>Agatha jerked away like she’d been burned.</p><p>“Don’t touch me,” she snapped. Her voice shook from fury. “You don’t get to touch me. You don’t get <em> anything </em>from me.”</p><p>And then she stormed into the crowd, the taste of panic rising fast in her throat.</p><p>She had to find Rio.</p><p>Because for one brief, unbearable moment, it had looked like she’d already lost her. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The moment Agatha stepped outside, rain hit her cold and relentless, soaking through the silk of her dress in seconds. She couldn’t care less. All she cared about was finding Rio.</p><p>Her heels clicked sharply against the pavement as she ran, eyes scanning the street for any glimpse of Rio’s figure.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>“Fuck,” she whispered, breath catching.</p><p>The parking lot was nearly empty. The street beyond it even more so. A few guests huddled under umbrellas, already retreating to their cars or back into the reception hall, but that was all.</p><p>But Rio—<em> her Rio </em>was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Agatha took off toward the sidewalk, dress clinging to her skin, hair flattening against her face and shoulders. The rain blurred everything. She turned a corner too fast and nearly slipped, catching herself on a lamppost just in time.</p><p>And then she saw her.</p><p>Halfway down the block, standing alone, just barely sheltered under the awning of a closed café, a cigarette in hand. Agatha couldn’t see her face, but her shoulders sagged in a way that made Agatha’s chest ache. Like maybe Rio was crying. And it was because of her.</p><p>Agatha took in a deep breath, gaining courage, and stepped forward.</p><p>“Rio!” she called, loud and hoarse.</p><p>But Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Agatha stopped just short of her, panting and drenched. “Please, Rio, let me explain.”</p><p>Rio turned slowly. Her eyes were glassy and red. She had definitely been crying. And now her face was lined with something worse than anger—<em> disappointment </em>.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said. “I thought you had your hands full.”</p><p>Agatha flinched. “It wasn’t what it looked like.”</p><p>Rio laughed. Bitter and broken. “That’s convenient.”</p><p>“She cornered me. I didn’t want her there any more than you did. I told her to fuck off.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw twitched. “Didn’t look like you were telling her to fuck off.”</p><p>“Because you didn’t stay long enough to see it!”</p><p>That statement hung between them while Rio decided if it was worth believing in it.</p><p>Agatha took a trembling step closer. “I would never—I <em> will </em> never—want anything to do with her again. She cheated on me. She made me feel like I was impossible to love and then had the audacity to act like I should be grateful for the pieces she left behind. You think I’d go back to that? After <em> this </em>?”</p><p>Rio’s arms stayed crossed. “I don’t know what <em> this </em> is.”</p><p>Agatha blinked hard against the stinging in her eyes, the rain not making it any easier.</p><p>“It’s real,” she said. “That’s what it is. It’s terrifying and stupid and I didn’t think I was capable of feeling like this ever again; not really. But then you showed up and—” Her voice broke. “And suddenly I’m remembering what it’s like to want to wake up next to someone. To trust someone. To want everything. With <em> you </em>.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, but she didn’t speak. So Agatha carried on.</p><p>“I know we said fake,” Agatha continued, softer now, like the words were a delicate thing she was laying on Rio. Like they might break if she spoke too loudly. “I know we were meant to just play pretend and get through the weekend, but I can’t pretend anymore. I can’t pretend not to want you. I can’t pretend that what you’re doing to my heart is normal. I can’t pretend that I don’t want to bet everything on you.”</p><p>Rio stared at her, unmoving, soaked to the bone. Rain streaked down her cheeks, blending with the tears already there.</p><p>Then—finally—she whispered, “Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, a hand reaching to brush Rio’s lips. “You don’t have to say anything. I don’t expect you to feel the same. I just needed—”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said again, firmer this time. “Let me speak.”</p><p>She nodded, terrified.</p><p>“It’s never been fake for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. “What?”</p><p>Rio looked away, then back at her, eyes full of something unspoken. “That’s why I said yes. To this whole mess. Because I already felt it. I just hadn’t admitted it yet.”</p><p>That was all it took.</p><p>One second they were confessing their love under the rain, and the next they were crashing into each other like gravity had finally snapped—hands tangling in wet hair and mouths finally meeting in a kiss that tasted like rain and rage and everything they hadn’t said until now. It wasn’t soft. It wasn’t neat. It was desperate and hungry, but somehow, it was perfect.</p><p>Agatha cupped Rio’s jaw like she couldn’t believe any of it was real. Rio clung to her waist like she was terrified she might vanish if she let go.</p><p>They kissed like they’d been waiting their whole lives. And in a way, they had.</p><p>The storm didn’t matter. They were two people starved, who had finally come home.</p><p>When they pulled apart, it was only for air. Foreheads pressed together. A laugh escaped them both. Then another kiss. Then another, deeper.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered against her lips, hands sliding down, finding their way to Rio’s ass. When she squeezed, Rio let out a breathless noise. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaky, stunned. “God, I thought you’d never ask.”</p><p>They kissed once more, flagging down the first cab they could find.</p><p>They were soaked. Shivering. Alive.</p><p>And they couldn’t wait to make it back to the motel.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They reached their motel room with a sense of urgency, with their breaths ragged and hearts drumming. The moment they made it inside, the door slammed shut behind them, louder than it needed to be, and the air between them shifted, now crackling with desire.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. Her hands shot up to Rio’s face, fingers trembling slightly as they cradled her warm skin. Her lips crashed onto Rio’s with an intensity that was almost desperate. She kissed like she was starving, her mouth greedy and raw, lips tugging, teeth grazing in sharp little teases that made Rio gasp.</p><p>Rio answered with equal hunger, her fingers knotting in the rain-soaked fabric of Agatha’s dress, yanking her closer, pinning her against the wall with a force that bordered on frantic. Her palms roamed down Agatha’s back—smooth, slick with rain and trembling beneath her touch—until they tangled in dark, dripping curls. She tugged, just hard enough to draw a guttural moan that echoed throughout the room.</p><p>Agatha’s head fell back, lips parted in a silent cry, body arching into Rio’s like she needed to be devoured whole.</p><p>Rio’s fingers slid along the curve of her spine, right to where the fabric ended and skin began. Her breath hitched when she finally got the chance to explore that exposed back, fingertips skimming over damp, flawless flesh, worshipping every inch.</p><p>“God, Agatha,” Rio whispered, voice thick with need, her lips ghosting along the nape of her neck, trailing hot, urgent kisses along the way. She slid her hands under the straps of Agatha’s dress, the silky fabric slipping down, exposing more of that soft skin that made her lose her mind, until it pooled at her feet.</p><p>Agatha stood there, breathless and bare, except for her lace underwear, water still clinging to her flushed skin.</p><p>Rio couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Her eyes drank in every inch—down the gentle slope of Agatha’s shoulders, the narrow waist, the subtle swell of hips—but <em> god, her breasts. </em> They were definitely the star of the show. Wide and full, perfectly shaped, flushed pink from the cold. They rose and fell with each ragged breath Agatha took, nipples begging for attention.</p><p>Her mouth went dry. She reached out with both hands, cupping her breasts with almost too much care, thumbs brushing slow, deliberate circles around the sensitive nipples. Agatha gasped—a sharp, helpless sound that went straight to Rio’s core.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio whispered, voice rough with want. “You’re fucking beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tangled in Rio’s soaked hair, pulling her closer until their bodies were flush, skin to skin, heat radiating from them both. “Show me,” she said breathlessly. “Please.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice.</p><p>Her mouth followed the path of her hands, trailing down Agatha’s neck, her collarbones, her breasts. She suckled slow, wet circles around one nipple before flicking her tongue across it, then biting—just a little. Agatha cried out, hips twitching, grinding gently against her. Rio moved to the other breast, repeating her movements, taking her time, savoring each sound that fell from Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stay still, hips pressing forward in search of friction, her thighs clenching with need.</p><p>But Rio wanted to take her time. Agatha’s skin was addictive—salt and rain and something uniquely her, driving Rio wild with every taste.</p><p>Rio’s mouth dipped lower, lips and tongue following the curve of her waist, then lower still, biting the soft skin of her hip. She felt Agatha’s pulse racing beneath her, heard the small moans that escaped her lips, and it only fueled her hunger.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tangled in her hair again, firm, guiding, dragging her down. “Eager, are we?” Rio murmured against her skin, letting out a low laugh. She kissed the inside of one thigh, then the other—slow, maddening—lingering just shy of Agatha’s core.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha growled, breath shaking. “Stop teasing and <em> fuck me </em>.”</p><p>With a wicked smirk, Rio obeyed. She sank to her knees, tugging Agatha’s panties down in one firm motion. Then her mouth found its place between Agatha’s thighs, tongue dragging once, slow and deliberate, savoring the first taste. “Fuck, you taste incredible,” she groaned.</p><p>Her tongue moved firmly, licking up the length of her slit before circling her clit and softly biting. Her hands slid up to cup the back of Agatha’s thighs, holding her there while she coaxed desperate moans from her mouth.</p><p>“Fuck—don’t stop. Just like that.”</p><p>Rio groaned low at the praise, sending vibrations straight into Agatha’s core. She licked deeper, her tongue broad and sure, her lips wrapping around Agatha’s clit and sucking with focused hunger.</p><p>Agatha’s hips started to stutter, rocking against Rio’s mouth helplessly, chasing friction with growing urgency. Rio sucked and swirled unrelentlessly while Agatha’s cries became breathless, her body tensing harder each time Rio hit just the right spot.</p><p>When it was finally too much—when Agatha’s legs were basically jelly and there was no way in hell she could stand without collapsing and crashing Rio’s head, she tugged firmly enough on her hair. “Bed,” she managed. “I need—fuck—bed.”</p><p>She pulled Rio up, kissed her like she meant to bruise, then stripped her dress off in one swift motion. Her hands slid down, squeezing Rio’s ass before she shoved her back onto the bed and climbed on top.</p><p>“Inside me. Now.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She quickly moved to slip two fingers inside of her, making Agatha’s head fall back, mouth opening in a sharp, breathy moan.</p><p>“God,” Rio muttered, watching her. “You feel so fucking good.” Her fingers curled inside, rubbing slow and precise against that perfect spot. Agatha rocked against her, chasing every motion with raw, desperate need.</p><p>Her hands gripped Rio’s shoulders, nails scraping, her rhythm messy and frantic. The wet sounds of their bodies moving together filled the air, slick and urgent, tangled with ragged breaths.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio…” Agatha gasped, her voice breaking. Her hips rolled harder, coaxing more from Rio’s fingers. “Don’t stop,” she begged. “Please, don’t stop.”</p><p>Rio sat up, mouth on Agatha’s neck, biting, sucking—marking her. “You’re mine,” she growled against her skin. “Only mine.” One hand stayed buried inside her while the other slid up to her throat, fingers wrapping just enough to make Agatha shiver.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha choked, eyes glassy. “I’m yours. No one else’s.”</p><p>The possessiveness made her tremble. She rode Rio’s hand harder, faster, the sounds between them wet and obscene. “More.”</p><p>Rio slipped in a third finger, thumb circling her clit—and Agatha let out an animalistic growl, raw and unfiltered.</p><p>Her whole body tensed, back arching, nails digging into Rio’s skin. “Say it again,” Rio demanded, voice dark. “Say you’re mine.”</p><p>“I’m yours,” Agatha gasped. “Yours—fuck—<em> yours </em>.”</p><p>That shattered something inside her. Her orgasm suddenly crashing through her in sharp, relentless bursts. She cried out, body locking around Rio’s fingers, thighs trembling as wave after wave tore through her.</p><p>Rio held her through it, fingers moving gently now, coaxing her through the aftershocks. She kissed Agatha’s jaw, her cheek, her throat— everywhere she could reach.</p><p>When Agatha finally came down from the high, her eyes fluttered open to meet Rio’s—soft, dark, yet full of tenderness.</p><p>“That was…” Agatha’s voice cracked, still thick with pleasure.</p><p>Rio smiled, wiping a stray strand of hair from Agatha’s face. “Just the beginning.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a shaky grin as her fingers cradled Rio’s jaw, pulling her back in for a long kiss.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t linger. She shifted, pushing Rio back down with her eyes gleaming and a teasing smirk. It was her turn now. </p><p>Agatha began sliding down Rio’s body, kissing, biting and licking hard enough to make sure she’d leave marks everywhere. She took her time worshipping Rio’s body—kissing her right beneath her earlobe, biting down her nipples and licking across her taut abs. By the time she reached Rio’s thighs, the tension was unbearable. </p><p>Agatha began by kissing a path up the inside of her thigh, then retracing and going for the other, her tongue teasing just shy of Rio’s center. Rio’s fingers tangled in her hair, tugging, breath caught in her throat, silently begging for more.</p><p>She wanted to keep tormenting her, but truth be told, Agatha was desperate to know what Rio tasted like. So her mouth finally moved to her center—no hesitation, just raw, possessive hunger. Her tongue parted Rio’s folds, exploring every slick inch with expert ease. Rio gasped, hips jerking up, desperate to press closer, to be consumed.</p><p>Agatha’s hands slid from hips to thighs, gripping tight as her tongue moved in slow, tantalizing movements, dipping into her entrance, then flicking up again, every movement calculated to drive Rio out of her mind. Her fingers tightened in Agatha’s damp hair, nails scratching across her scalp with frantic intensity.</p><p>It was euphoric—and yet, not nearly enough. So Agatha shifted, grinding her soaked cunt against the mattress, aiming to feel some friction. </p><p>As soon as Rio noticed, she let out a low, helpless moan. The mere sight of Agatha, so wild and focused on eating her out while also chasing her own orgasm, sent a spark straight through her core.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha…” Rio’s voice cracked, breathless and raw. The heat pooling in her belly was turning sharp, urgent, a need that only grew with every stroke of Agatha’s tongue.</p><p>Agatha lifted her gaze, mouth wet, chin slick, smile feral. “You like that, don’t you?” she asked, voice thick with satisfaction, not even pretending to be innocent.</p><p>Rio nodded, eyes wide, too overwhelmed to speak. Agatha’s mouth found her clit again, this time more insistent, sucking hard enough to make Rio cry out and buck against her face.</p><p>“Mmm, Agatha…”</p><p>“Does my pretty girl need more?” Agatha murmured, her breath hot against Rio’s skin. One hand slid down, fingers hovering at her entrance, teasing the edge.</p><p>Rio’s response was a broken sound—nothing close to words, just raw need. Her hips thrust up, chasing Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>“Use your words, pretty girl.”</p><p>“More,” Rio begged. “Please.”</p><p>Agatha slid one finger in, then another, slow but deep, curling just right. Her tongue never stopped: licking, sucking, devouring. Meanwhile, her free hand slipped down between her own thighs, touching herself as she kept grinding against the bed, determined to come with Rio. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio moaned, almost sobbed, yanking at her hair, trying to bring her closer as her own body trembled violently beneath her.</p><p>Agatha just smiled against her, then doubled down. Her fingers pumped deeper, her tongue faster, never stopping. Rio’s back arched, a cry ripping from her throat as the climax crashed over her like a massive wave.</p><p>Agatha kept her eyes locked on her, watching every tremor, every twitch, every desperate breath. She didn’t let up, coaxing every drop of pleasure out of her, even as her own orgasm surged.</p><p>She came moaning into Rio’s cunt, her whole body shaking. The sound of her grinding pushed Rio even further, her muscles seizing, thighs trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>As the tremors eased, Agatha slowed, fingers still inside, mouth now gentler, until she finally pressed a slow kiss to Rio’s thigh and crawled up to kiss her mouth once more, soft and long.</p><p>Their bodies remained tangled, sticky and shaking, skin flushed and glowing. But the night was far from over.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The bell over the coffee shop door jingled as Agatha and Rio stepped inside, and the soft murmur of conversation filled the air. Agatha’s hand was still ghosting against the small of Rio’s back, fingers curling like she couldn’t quite let go. Rio looked smug, hair still slightly tousled, wearing one of Agatha's sweaters like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>They scanned the room until they spotted Alice and Jen already seated near the window, sipping their usual iced coffees while engrossed in conversation.</p><p>Agatha immediately dropped her hand, but the damage was done. Rio leaned into her to whisper something—something private, stupid and definitely not appropriate for public—and Agatha snorted mid-breath, eyes scrunching up before she caught herself.</p><p>Jen’s straw froze mid-sip. Alice set her cup down.</p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Jen said, one eyebrow shooting up.</p><p>Alice was basically vibrating in her seat. “Oh my god, <em> you’re together </em> . I knew it. I <em> knew </em> it!”</p><p>Agatha tried to play it cool, she really did. She faked nonchalance and shrugged off her coat like she hadn’t just orgasmed against Rio’s thigh less than 24 hours ago. “Morning,” she said, too breezy. “You two been here long?”</p><p>Jen didn’t even blink. “Isn’t that your sweater?”</p><p>“Obviously not,” Agatha replied, too quickly. “Just… similar material.”</p><p>“Sure,” Alice said, grinning.</p><p>Rio slid into the booth beside Agatha, her thigh pressed close, and made no effort to keep any distance. She looked positively serene. Agatha, meanwhile, was begging the universe to stop their friends from making this A Thing.</p><p>“You have the same smirk,” Alice pointed out.</p><p>“It was a good wedding,” Agatha said, throwing Rio a look, meant for her eyes only to understand.</p><p>“It <em> definitely </em>was,” Rio said with a sweet smile directed at her.</p><p>“<em> You,” </em> Jen said, pointing a finger at Agatha, “look like you’ve been fucked to exhaustion.” Before any of the women could add anything, she continued. “And don’t think I didn’t see the matching hickeys on your necks. Or <em> that </em>bite mark, Jesus. You guys are animals.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, hiding her face in her hands. “Can we <em> not </em> do this here?”</p><p>Rio just smiled and stole a sip from Agatha’s coffee, because apparently they were at <em> that </em> level of domesticity now.</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Jen said. “I want confirmation. The years of sexual tension? The eye-fucking? Gone?”</p><p>“Not <em> gone </em>,” Rio said calmly, eyes twinkling. “Just… being handled.”</p><p>Alice made a noise that sounded too much like a squealing sound. “Wait, <em> when </em> ? Was it the rehearsal dinner? The reception? Oh my god, was it <em> during the speeches </em>? Please let it be during the speeches.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, dragging her fingers through her hair. “Okay, yes, fine. We’re… <em> a thing. </em> It stopped being fake at some point and then it got complicated and then we—look, it’s real. We’re figuring it out.”</p><p>Rio’s hand slid beneath the table and found hers, interlacing their fingers together. “It’s not that complicated,” she said, eyes on Agatha. “It’s just you and me.”</p><p>Alice actually clapped. Jen looked incredibly smug.</p><p>“Thank god,” Jen said. “Now maybe you’ll both stop being so <em> insufferable </em>with your doey eyes and yearning looks.”</p><p>“Fuck off, Jennifer,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Jen flipped her off, entirely unbothered.</p><p>“But, like—how was the sex?” she added.</p><p>“Oooh, yes!” Alice cut in, practically bouncing. “Was it, like, end-of-the-world good? Because <em> that </em> is the vibe I’m getting right now.”</p><p>“I’m a sex god, did you expect anything else?” Agatha said, almost like stating a fact.</p><p>Rio grinned. “Let’s just say I didn’t get much sleep.”</p><p>They all burst into laughter, voices overlapping, coffees growing warm and forgotten.</p><p>And as the morning spilled into noon, Agatha and Rio stayed with their hands intertwined beneath the table, easy in their closeness, unafraid of being seen. What had started off as something fake was now the promise of forever hanging between them. Because, for once, they were sure that none of them was letting <em> this </em>go. They weren’t letting each other go. </p>
