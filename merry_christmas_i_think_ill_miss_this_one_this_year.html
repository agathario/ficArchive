      Chapter 1: rio

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio drags her wheeled suitcase over the uneven stones of the front walkway and comes face-to-face with her childhood home, receiving her annual reminder that her foster mother has the most Christmas spirit out of anyone in Westview, New Jersey.</p><p>Lilia’s a a bit of a bleeding heart – as evidenced by her taking in Rio even after she was far too old to be adopted and making sure she had a home, and a family, and all of those cliché things tragic orphans didn’t usually get – and the consequences of her over-sensitivity manifest every time there’s a holiday. She organizes toy drives and community potlucks and neighborhood egg hunts and always, <i>always,</i> has the most decked-out house on the block. String lights, blow up creatures from hell, the whole shebang. Last year she’d invested in one of those little projector thingys and actually paid for custom filters to splash red-and-green tarot cards all over the front of her house. It was gaudy, and ridiculous, and so perfectly Lilia. And every time Rio sees it, it feels like coming home.</p><p>She doesn't even need to press the doorbell – that only works about ten percent of the time – or knock before the front door swings open and the firey Sicilian has Rio sandwiched into a bear hug (despite Rio having at least three inches on her).</p><p>“Hi, hi,” Rio half-groans into Lilia’s shoulder. The house is warm and smells like baking eggplant and tomatoes; outside is cold and sad. She wants to be inside, desperately. “I’m sad and lonely and look like shit, I know.”</p><p>“You do look like shit. How long was that plane ride?” Lilia ushers Rio inside, already shucking her coat off her shoulders and plucking her hat from her head.</p><p>Rio sighs, rolling her neck out and feeling the house settle into her bones like home. “Long,” she admits, padding along on socked feet behind Lilia as she led her to the kitchen. Sauce simmers on the stove, and – thank fuck – a plate of Lilia’s rosette cookies sits on the counter, freshly iced by the look of them. Rio slumps into a kitchen stool and reaches for one greedily. “I feel like I’ve been traveling for years. I shouldn’t have taken the Monterey job; too many hours and my knee is still fucked.”</p><p>For the past few years, Rio’s been crossing the country working high-end landscaping jobs. Corporate campuses, overpriced mansions, and the like. The contract to do six properties in a new development in Northern California (for houses <i>far</i> out of Rio’s personal price range) had seemed like a dream at the time – the pay was amazing, complete creative control, and a beautiful location to stay for six months – but what she had considered was that she’d be working clear on the other side of the country up until the week before Christmas with few breaks, <i>and</i> her ACL was still healing after the injury that had put her out of the Westview rec basketball league for the season.</p><p>Now here she is, with a little padding in her bank account but feeling like she might fall asleep in the dish of pasta alla norma Lilia waves under her nose. “<i>Mangia,</i>” Lilia commands mercilessly, and Rio complies, because the food really is that good. “I told you not to burn yourself out over some azaleas.”</p><p>“Don’t you <i>dare,</i>” Rio grumbles. She knows what most people say about her – that there is a hell of a lot more she could be doing with a master’s in plant biology than planting summer starts for rich people – but Lilia never had the heart to tease her for chasing her passion. If her passion just so happens to be smearing herself in dirt and traveling non-stop, that's her business.</p><p>Lilia smiles apologetically, and Rio knows she didn’t mean it, not really. “I just wish you’d rest for a little while. Spread some roots for yourself, for once.” Lilia’s arched eyebrow has enough innuendo in it that Rio grumbles and hides her red cheeks behind the steam rising from her dish. “Now eat faster. We have to hit the grocery store before it closes.”</p><p>“Grocery- Lilia, you <i>just</i> cooked.”</p><p>The long-suffering sigh Rio receives is warranted, by older-Italian-woman standards. “I have three days of cooking ahead of me, my girl. Do you want to go hungry while you’re home?” Rio does not protest, as she very well could, that she is capable of living off of saltine crackers and microwaved tomato soup if she tries hard enough. “I thought not. Eat your pasta and get your boots on.”</p><p>---</p><p>When Lilia’s ancient Subaru chugs to a stop in the slushy parking spot, Rio’s jaw drops.</p><p>“No. <i>No.</i>”</p><p>“Get out of the car, Rio.”</p><p>“Lilia.” The gloved hand Rio lays on Lilia’s arm makes her hesitate for a fraction of a second. “<i>Please</i> don’t make me go in there.”</p><p>To her credit, Lilia does frown in a way that shows she at least somewhat acknowledges Rio’s plight. “They’re the only ones who carry the good sausage.”</p><p>The Westview Local Market is <i>the</i> grocery store in town. Closest central location to the major neighborhoods, typically stocked well, and open until 9:00, weekdays and weekends. Unfortunately, that means it is a hub for every single local Rio had absolutely no interest in seeing. Every time she gets back in town and sets foot in the market, she runs into <i>somebody</i> and has an interaction so awkward it makes her want to go outside and stab her own eye with an icicle.</p><p>Last Fourth of July, it had been her senior-year English teacher, Lilia’s weird racist neighbor, and <i>two</i> girls she’d ghosted from high school. One of whom had kids already.</p><p>Yeah, Rio fucking hates the Westview Local Market. But Lilia is pushing ahead through the parking lot, dodging exhausted soccer moms pushing carts of toilet paper and fresh produce, and Rio is resigned to her fate. On the way in, she almost trips over her own feet and gets hit in the face by someone carrying a wreath over their heads.</p><p>Sweet Jesus.</p><p>The market hasn’t changed its layout since before Rio was born, so she follows Lilia around on autopilot, grabbing ingredients as directed. She keeps her head low and dodges any feet that look even remotely familiar. Some guy who used to pelt her with eggs in high school (cause yeah, Westview is <i>that</i> kind of town) works at the deli now and Rio makes a wide berth to avoid getting hit in the head with raw meat, this time.</p><p>Halfway through Lilia sorting through <i>every individual spice in the spice section,</i> Rio gets fed up and checks her watch. “Can I go get some wine?” A beat. “Or something stronger?”</p><p>“You’re a big girl, Rio,” Lilia mutters, not unkindly, over her shoulder. "Just grab the red I need off the list, if you can?"</p><p>Rio salutes and ducks out of the aisle just as a young woman balancing two wailing twins comes sailing in that she vaguely recognizes from the public library. <i>Perfect timing.</i></p><p>Surprisingly for six PM on a Friday evening, the alcohol section is weirdly empty. The only other person there is a woman, a little older than Rio and unmistakably elegant in a way that Westview is <i>not,</i> inspecting wine labels with clinical precision.</p><p>Rio waits behind her for about thirty seconds before clearing her throat, loudly. The woman turns around, and Rio is momentarily breathless at the sight of maybe the bluest eyes she’s ever seen.</p><p>She recovers quickly, for a woman as gay as she happens to be. “Uh, you’re blocking the merlot.”</p><p>The woman gazes down at the wine in front of her, then at Rio, dragging her eyes up and down her body in the kind of judgmental way that has Rio hot under the collar for a multitude of reasons. She feels like she’s being judged by a principal. She’s all too aware of still being in her sweatpants and fuzzy socks from the plane. And that her hair is flat and lifeless and probably greasy. <i>Way to make a good impression on a hot stranger. </i></p><p>“This is a malbec,” the woman finally says, raising the bottle in her leather-gloved hand. At Rio’s confused look, she adds, “not a merlot.”</p><p>Rio fidgets, feeling a little dumb already. “Well, uh, I need a red wine, so.”</p><p>“If you can’t tell red wines apart, how do you know you need a red wine at all?” Still, the woman steps aside slightly so Rio can fit in and pretend she knows what any of the labels mean. She’s more of a beer-and-hard-liquor girl herself. Also, the woman is still distractingly close, and she smells like very expensive flower perfume, which isn’t helping with the whole <i>focusing</i> situation.</p><p>She plucks a bottle off the shelf that looks vaguely like the one the mystery woman is holding. “Well, um, it’s for a braised beef ragu, so, I guess, um, it’s a recipe.” This is embarrassing. Rio should not be this tongue-tied in front of a hot older woman she barely knows. Clearing her throat, she adds – in an attempt to get the upper hand – “besides, wine tends to get me a little sloppy, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Oops. Possibly, too far. The woman flinches slightly and Rio realizes that she should maybe stop provoking mysterious women in grocery stores. Speaking of – this is the first person she’s seen in the Westview Local in years that she doesn’t recognize in some way. So against her better judgement, she follows up her faux pas with a very awkward “are you new in town?”</p><p>The woman blinks, caught off guard. “Is that- is that a line, or…”</p><p>“I mean, it’s a small town grocery store.” Rio cringes, because her big gay mouth needs to know when to shut up sometimes. “I know everybody here. I’ve made out with half the people who work the register.” <i>Shut up, shut up, shut up stop talking-</i> “I haven’t made out with you, though.”</p><p>The woman-stranger’s jaw drops open like a fish, then snaps closed as a self-satisfied smirk spreads over her features. “No, but you’re doing a bang-up job trying to get us there.”</p><p>In an attempt to get <i>out of this conversation,</i> Rio picks up a second bottle of wine and tries to figure out the difference between the two brands. Despite making intense eye contact with practically identical labels, the woman makes no move to leave. In fact, she sways slightly on her feet, almost like she’s rooting herself to the stop. “I’m Agatha,” she says after a beat, and Rio’s head whips up, cheeks embarrassingly pink (as if that’s the most embarrassing thing that’s happening right now). “Since you were so interested in getting to know me,” she adds cheekily.</p><p>“I’m, um. Rio.” Rio sticks out her hand, and Agatha shakes it, bemused. Rio realizes it’s the wrong hand. <i>Fuck.</i> “Rio Vidal. Local cryptid. Landscaper.”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Agatha says softly, leaning against the shelf and removing her gloves, one finger at a time, revealing elegant hands that Rio would like all over her body, right now, thank you very much. “<i>New in town,</i> apparently. Lawyer.”</p><p>“Cool.” Rio’s tongue is about to dig a hole through the inside of her cheek with how hard she’s pressing it there. She balances the bottles in her hands and decides to plunge even deeper, because the weird-girl-charm hasn’t sent Agatha running yet and, as previously mentioned, this mysterious stranger is stupid pretty. “Um, which do you recommend?”</p><p>“For a ragu?” Agatha smirks. “Something cheaper.” She gestures to the price tags under the wines Rio’s holding, and yep, that’s probably more expensive than it needs to be for something that is, at best, adding flavor to beef. “You really don’t drink wine, do you?”</p><p>“No.” Rio grumbles, and puts the bottles down. Agatha tuts and immediately picks one of them back up.</p><p>“Well, allow me to educate you,” she chastises, shaking the bottle in Rio’s face, and- is this rizz? Does Rio have rizz, and is it working on this remarkably put-together woman in the Westview Local Market, of all places? She shuffles a step closer to Agatha, allowing herself a brief (not creepy) inhale of her perfume.</p><p>Agatha pokes at words on the wine label and explains what they mean, and it’s probably really interesting, but Rio’s mind has gone a little fuzzy with proximity. Lilia is probably wondering where she is. She doesn’t remotely care. Agatha brushes her fingers down her arm, and even through Rio’s jacket the touch is electric. “I would go with this one, for the cooking,” Agatha suggests finally, passing a much cheaper, much smaller bottle into Rio’s hands, “and <i>this</i> one for your education.” Agatha cradles a deep pink rosé almost reverently. Leaning in close to Rio’s ear, she whispers conspiratorially, “this kind of thing usually gets <i>me</i> sloppy drunk enough to make out with grocery store cashiers, <i>if you know what I mean.</i>”</p><p>Hearing her own words parroted back at her, almost mockingly, makes Rio sort of alarmingly confident. Now that she has confirmation that there <i>is</i> a game afoot, she can play it. Biting down at the corner of her lip, she grins, drags her eyes pointedly up Agatha’s body. Her black stockings have a tiny run on the inner calf. Adorable. Weirdly sexy.</p><p>“Maybe,” she says, getting all up in Agatha’s space in a way that has the older woman inhaling sharply through her nose and practically crossing her eyes, “we could test that theory?</p><p>“Don’t you normally take girls out to dinner before accosting them in random grocery stores?”</p><p>“I don’t do anything normally,” Rio shrugs, and winks. Agatha, if she’s hearing right – <i>please, please let her be hearing right</i> – fucking <i>gasps.</i></p><p>Emboldened, Rio flicks her eyes down to Agatha’s lips. “You know, I practically live on the naughty list,” she murmurs, raising the hand that isn’t holding a bottle of wine to brush against Agatha’s shoulder teasingly. “I bet I could-”</p><p>Something shatters. Something shatters, and it’s definitely <i>not</i> in Rio’s head, because something cold and wet <i>also</i> splashes all over her shoes, and Agatha shrieks, jumping back. At some point – Rio’s ego doesn’t think it’s right to point out that it’s because of her completely unsubtle innuendos, but it definitely is – the bottle Agatha had been holding had slipped from her hand.</p><p>As Rio drags her eyes back from the puddle at their feet to Agatha’s face, she realizes that no, no it had not – no, Agatha had been white-knuckling that shit so hard she squeezed it to death. Rio knows this because Agatha’s hands are soaked, and there are tiny pieces of glass embedded in her palms.</p><p>“Oh my- oh fuck, oh shit, shit, I’m sorry-” Rio babbles as she reaches for Agatha’s hands, inspecting them for the largest shards of glass, anything that looks like it needs to come out immediately. “Goddamn it, fuck, I didn’t mean to- how did you even-”</p><p>(Agatha must be <i>really</i> strong to break a wine bottle with her bare hands. Rio’s not thinking about that right now. Or at least, she’s pretending not to be thinking about it.)</p><p>Agatha’s blood drips down her forearms and splashes into the pink mess at their feet. Rio looks over Agatha’s shoulder and sees Billy, the emo teen she used to babysit and who now clearly works at the market, standing at the end of the aisle, gaping. She glares at him.</p><p>“Uh, cleanup in aisle eight!” he hollers, and darts off for a broom. Rio squeezes Agatha’s wrists, and the other woman makes a pained sound.</p><p>“<i>Fuck,</i>” she says through her teeth, and Rio starts dragging her towards the exit. “Wait, no, you can-”</p><p>“Shut up. You’re going to urgent care.”</p><p>“Why are <i>you</i> going with me?” Rio can’t tell if Agatha is more pissed or confused, but as she pulls them into the parking lot – barely paying attention to the fact that the bottle of wine Agatha had handed her is still under her arm, and the store’s alarms are going off – she just shrugs it off.</p><p>“Dunno,” she says, and holds out her hand. “Where’s your car?”</p><p>Agatha fishes her keys from her coat pocket and drops them into Rio’s outstretched palm without a word.</p><p>---</p><p>This is a disaster. This whole night is a disaster, and Rio should go dig a hole outside and bury herself. Maybe she would grow into a very nice tree.</p><p>Agatha comes hobbling into the urgent care waiting room looking pretty pale and shaken, more than Rio would have thought for such a minor injury, but, well, maybe it wasn’t that minor. <i>She’s</i> certainly never cracked a wine bottle in her hands before. She stands immediately, and Agatha wanders over, smile tight but kind of gracious.</p><p>She slumps into the chair beside Rio, head in her hands. “I hate hospitals,” she groans. “Or urgent cares. Or whatever. If it smells like… this,” she waves a hand in the air, “I hate it.”</p><p>“Bad memories?”</p><p>“You could say that.” Agatha drags her hand down her face, turning her head slowly to make eye contact with Rio. “Thank you for driving me, though. They said if it had taken any longer to get the glass out I would have needed more stitches.”</p><p>Rio glances down at Agatha’s bandaged hands, then back up to her face, still too pale for her liking. “Do you… are you okay to drive home yourself or do you want me to help?”</p><p>“I’ve got it,” Agatha says, voice a little tight, and Rio’s secretly grateful, because she’s already texted Lilia and even though the car ride home will be very awkward, it would be even more awkward to cancel and say <i>sorry, I have to drive the total stranger whose hands I unintentionally mangled back to her house, too.</i></p><p>“Are you… are you okay? Do you need something? I didn’t mean to bring you to a place where you would- well, I’m, I didn’t know. And I’m really sorry about-”</p><p>“You look athletic.” Agatha’s curious voice drags Rio out of her nervous stammer. “Do you work out?”</p><p>“I play basketball.”</p><p>“Of fucking course you do.”</p><p>“Is that…” Rio’s not sure why Agatha has tilted her head back and is pinching her nose like that. “Should I not?”</p><p>“You’re very attractive,” Agatha slurs, and Rio feels her cheeks heat up. “And… I am high on pain medication.”</p><p>“Nothing wrong with that.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond. Rio checks her phone. Lilia sent a <i>be there in twenty</i> text sixteen minutes ago.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha twists in her chair to look at Rio under the curtain of her slightly messy hair. “You’re home for the holidays, aren’t you?” Rio nods, dragging her feet underneath her to sit sideways in her own chair, cross-legged, watching Agatha think. “That’s nice. Nice to be home for the holidays.”</p><p>“Do you not go home?”</p><p>“Nowhere to go,” Agatha says, waving the notion away with a hand in the air, and Rio doesn’t make her elaborate. “So you’re a hot stranger home for the holidays and you do gardening.”</p><p>“Landscaping.”</p><p>“Same difference.”</p><p>“It’s really not.” Rio’s eyes narrow. “Don’t make me go all professional on you.”</p><p>“I think the ship sailed from <i>professional</i> a long time ago.”</p><p>“Go back to calling me hot. I liked you better when you were doing that.”</p><p>Agatha stiffens. Belatedly, Rio realizes what she said – tries to find the words to say <i>I think I still like you when you’re insulting my profession, too, it’s fine actually, just keep talking</i> – but Agatha is already shifting away. “Do you have my keys, still?” she asks softly, not looking Rio in the eye.</p><p>“Um, yeah.” She fishes them out of her own jacket pocket and deposits them in Agatha’s lap carefully. “Are you sure you can drive with your hands?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Agatha bites. She stands up and brushes invisible dirt from her pencil skirt, clinically not meeting Rio’s eye.</p><p>“Hey, I didn’t mean to-”</p><p>“Well, this has been humiliating,” Agatha hums, and completely steamrolls any of Rio’s attempts to fix this. She straightens her back, slinging her pocketbook over her shoulder. “It was… <i>something</i> to meet you, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha turns on a kitten heel and heads for the urgent care exit. Rio stands up, to stop her, to apologize, to do… something, but Agatha is halfway through the sliding doors. She gets caught in the vestibule by someone coming in the opposite way, and Rio’s heart drops to her stomach when she sees Lilia grab Agatha by the arm and greet her with a warm smile.</p><p>Because of <i>course</i> Lilia knows Agatha. Because of course she does. They chat for a moment or two, and Rio keeps expecting Agatha’s eyes to dart back towards her, for Lilia’s expression to morph into one of horror when Agatha inevitably spills all of the creepy and weird things Rio has probably done, but no such moment comes. Instead, Lilia wraps Agatha in a brief, friendly embrace, and lets her go through the exit with a smile and a wave. She comes bustling into the urgent care a moment later, glaring at Rio more out of concern than anger.</p><p>“Is that woman you drove here all right?” she asks. Rio is mindless, confused, watching Agatha’s hips sway as she walks through the parking lot. Outside, it’s starting to snow.</p><p>“Uh- she’s fine. She left.” Agatha <i>could</i> have spilled all of Rio’s dirty secrets to Lilia, but didn’t. For some reason. Even though she has no reason to know who Lilia is to Rio, or inclination to protect Rio in the slightest. Which is kind of… nice. “Do you know her? That woman?”</p><p>“Oh,” Lilia says brusquely, ushering Rio out into the cold night air. “That was Agatha Harkness. She’s lovely; just moved in down the street earlier this year. A bit uptight but I’d like to think we’ve managed her. She’s coming to Christmas Eve dinner; you can meet her then.”</p><p><i>She’s coming to Christmas Eve dinner.</i> Rio tries to bury her shock and panic under a shiver as Lilia unlocks the Subaru.</p><p>Well, she’s fucked.</p>

<p>Squeezing a bottle of nice, expensive red wine in her hands reminds Agatha a little bit too much of her mishap in the grocery store three days ago, so she settles for putting it in one of those gift bags made for alcohol instead and carrying it to Lilia’s house that way.</p><p>She doesn’t normally <em>do </em>this. Christmas, for one – not much of a point when you’ve completely cut your mother off and have more cats than you do friends – or going over to people’s houses for Christmas, to make it even worse. But Lilia is nice, and direct in a way Agatha respects in a person, and she had been no-nonsense when she’d made the invitation. <em>No one in this neighborhood is going to spend the holiday alone, </em>she had said, and Agatha is loath to admit it but she wasn’t really looking forward to spending another year alone on her couch with the cats and the Hallmark channel.</p><p>So now she’s here. Cradling a bottle of wine and startling when Lilia’s front door wrenches open to reveal a skinny teenage boy wearing a tarot card-themed ugly sweater.</p><p>“Do I know you?” Agatha squints, and realizes the boy is the same kid who works in the grocery store where she broke that fucking bottle – and <em>he </em>must recognize her at the same time, because his eyes go wide and he fucking <em>grins. </em></p><p>“No, but now you do!” He reaches out and shakes her free hand. His whole body is pretty much vibrating. “I’m Billy Kaplan. I’m Jewish but everyone in the neighborhood comes over for Lilia’s Christmas Eve dinner. And you’re Agatha Harkness, because it says so on your mailbox.” <em>Creepy, but okay. </em>“Come in, silly! It’s cold outside!”</p><p>Billy Kaplan tells her that it’s a no-shoes household, so Agatha reluctantly kicks off her heels and hangs her jacket on the overflowing coat rack by the door. Lilia meets her in the entryway, breaking apart from the soft chorus of voices Agatha can hear coming from the sitting room, and envelops her in a warm, Italian-grandmother hug.</p><p>“Thank you for coming, Agatha,” Lilia says, and sounds like she means it. “Oh, and you brought wine!” She inspects the label. “A little cheap, but okay.”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha cautions. “It doesn’t matter when you’re trying to get drunk.”</p><p>“Do you think being wasted will get you through this faster?” Agatha’s only answer is a grumble. “Buckle in, sweetheart. We’re gonna smother you with charm tonight.”</p><p><em>Oh, joy. </em>Someone calls Lilia’s name, and she starts back towards the sitting room, gesturing over her shoulder. “Put the wine in the kitchen! And help yourself to the cheese spread.”</p><p>The teenager has disappeared, so Agatha finds her way to the kitchen by herself. She’s never been further than the foyer of Lilia’s house, but the layout is pretty simple. Of course, when she sees the unfortunately familiar person loitering in the kitchen with her head in the oven, she wishes it was a little more labyrinthine because she'd <em>really </em>like to get lost right now.</p><p>Rio Vidal (local cryptid, landscaper) pulls her head out of the oven, kicks it shut, and brushes her hands off. She’s muttering something about <em>basting, </em>of all things, and freezes like a deer in headlights when she turns and sees Agatha there, holding a bottle of wine above her head like an idiot.</p><p>A beat.</p><p>“Are you gonna throw that at me?” Rio asks, timidly, and Agatha realizes what she’s doing and slams the bottle down on the counter, a little too hard. Thankfully, nothing breaks this time.</p><p>She wants to leave, just bolt right out of the kitchen, but Rio steps forward until she’s pressing into the counter and starts talking so earnestly Agatha feels like she can’t move. “I’m sorry,” Rio says, eyes so big and mournful, “I’m really sorry about what happened the other night, and if I made you feel uncomfortable, I’m just- I’m not used to- well, no. I do okay with new people, usually, but you’re just, um- I don’t know, but I got flustered…”</p><p>Agatha zones out as Rio drones on, letting her smooth murmur fade to background noise. God, Rio’s pretty. Agatha should be too old to be calling people <em>pretty, </em>like some Hobbit creature, but it was the first thing she noticed when Rio came up to her in the grocery store, cheeks pink from cold and bundled up in a mismatched cozy outfit. She looks too pretty to touch. Like, Agatha wants to shrink her and put her in her pocket and carry her around places. That’s not <em>normal. </em></p><p>Tonight, Rio’s a little more put together – dressed in a simple black dress and tights, barefoot on the kitchen tile – but she’s no less <em>pretty </em>with her hair falling gently around her shoulders, just the right side of messy and unbrushed. Agatha has the sudden, stupid impulse to reach out and wind a strand of it around her fingers.</p><p>Life had been so much easier when she thought she would probably never see this woman again.</p><p>“Um, how are your hands?” Rio asks, yanking Agatha swiftly out of her reverie. She glances down at her palms; the only evidence left of her little mishap in the wine aisle is a bandage on her left thumb where a piece of glass dug in particularly deep.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she says. Her voice comes out weird and small. What is <em>happening </em>to her?</p><p>“Okay, good.” Rio seems to breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>Agatha looks up and makes the mistake of looking right into Rio’s big brown eyes. “You don’t have to apologize to me,” she says, like a sap, and then, “what are you doing here?”</p><p>“I live here.” Rio must clock the subtle face of confusion Agatha tries to hide. Really, she needs to do a better job keeping her emotions to herself. “Yeah, Lilia is my foster mother. She took me in after my parents died and just… never got rid of me.” That sounds like a very Lilia thing to do. From the look of it – Rio’s tense lips when she mentions her parents, compared to the light in her eyes when she says Lilia’s name – it was the right choice. “That’s why, you know – Lilia <em>Calderu, </em>Rio <em>Vidal.</em>”</p><p>“Rio Vidal has a nice ring to it,” Agatha says, like an idiot.</p><p>“I think so, too.” Rio fucking <em>winks. </em>There go the tables, turning again, like the universe can’t decide which one of them should be embarrassed at any given time but one of them <em>has </em>to be embarrassed. If Agatha’s blushing right now, she’s gonna end it right here. She can drown herself in a kitchen sink if she tries hard enough.</p><p>Rio fidgets with her hands. “Can we… start over?” she asks. “Just, since we got off to such a weird start and all.” She sticks her hand straight out – the proper one, this time, Agatha notes with amusement. “I’m Rio Vidal. Welcome to Westview.”</p><p>“Thanks, Rio Vidal, but I’ve been living here for six months,” Agatha quips with a wry smile, taking Rio’s hand in her own. She has callouses on every finger – probably from the landscaping – and she smiles so big. “I’m Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Agatha.”</p><p>“Nice to meet <em>you, </em>Rio.”</p><p>They keep shaking hands, looking at each other dumbly – Agatha thinks she might, mortifyingly, be getting lost in Rio’s eyes – until Lilia pokes her head into the kitchen. She takes one look at the two of them and shakes her head fondly.</p><p>“You two, out of here. I need to start getting the food out.” Lilia points with two fingers towards the dining room. “Rio, set the table.”</p><p>Rio sends Agatha a commiserating look and starts pulling cutlery out of a drawer. Agatha, heart racing, cheeks red – might be dying.</p><p>---</p><p>She ends up sitting next to Rio at dinner. Of course she does.</p><p>The thing is, Agatha doesn’t <em>do </em>this. Flirt, sure. Yes. All the time. Master Flirter, Agatha Harkness. She’s very good at it. But it just usually happens in bars, or clubs, or whatever passes for a <em>disreputable establishment </em>in Westview, New Jersey. She’s got it down to a science; she knows exactly how many flirtatious remarks and well-timed arm brushes it takes to get a woman into her bed. And she’s perfected the art of kicking them out in the morning.</p><p>What Agatha does <em>not </em>do is feelings, or friendliness, which is really unfortunate, because every time Rio smiles or laughs at a joke Sharon Davis makes (and they’re not that funny) Agatha’s chest gets a little tight. And then Rio plucks the cherry from her Manhattan, rolls it around in her mouth for a little bit, and takes a long swallow and Agatha’s whole body goes red-hot. There is a strange, terrifying mixture of <em>affectionate </em>and <em>horny </em>bubbling in her gut right now, and it’s freaking her out.</p><p>(For a woman who flirted awkwardly with her in a grocery store and then drove her to urgent care, no less.)</p><p>It doesn’t help when Rio turns to her in the midst of Agatha heaping grilled salmon onto her plate and says casually, “so what do you do?”</p><p>Agatha narrowly avoids dropping a cherry tomato in her lap. “I’m a lawyer. I told you already.”</p><p>“But we’re starting over, remember?” Amusement, apparently, makes Rio’s eyes go crinkly and her nose scrunch up. This does absolutely <em>nothing </em>to the speed at which Agatha’s heart is beating. “<em>So, </em>what do you do?”</p><p>Agatha sighs and lowers her forkful of salmon back to her plate. “I’m a lawyer.” Rio gestures for her to go on, chin propped in her hand, looking genuinely interested. “Estate lawyer. I make sure the siblings and the cousins don’t go to war over the prized antiques. It’s boring stuff.”</p><p>“That’s not boring at all,” Rio says, and sounds like she means it. “What’s the weirdest will you’ve ever read?”</p><p>And because Agatha read a truly heinous will a few days ago in which the grumpy old guy left every cent to a New York-based BDSM society, she tells her about it.</p><p>Her and Rio make pleasant conversation throughout dinner – all seven fishes <em>and </em>dessert. Agatha would feel a little bad for the way they’re clearly isolating the other dinner guests, but it feels kind of nice to have Rio’s relentless attention on her, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s face, those sweet, breathy laughs directed at <em>her </em>jokes. Maybe it’s her imagination, but Rio keeps inching her chair closer, finding excuses to reach over Agatha to grab a saltshaker or the bread rolls, and every time their skin brushes, even accidentally, Agatha feels like she’s been shocked by lightning. Okay, so maybe it’s been a few months since she’s hooked up with anyone, but it’s pretty embarrassing to be <em>this </em>desperate for a woman she’s met twice. Even if she is a local cryptid and landscaper, and Agatha’s not going to lie, she’s thought about Rio in a pair of overalls with dirt smeared on her cheek… more than once.</p><p>Lilia passes dishes of panettone and vanilla ice cream around, and Agatha’s thinking of ways to get Rio alone somehow. From the way Rio’s eyeing her hands when she flexes her fingers around her bowl (<em>yes, </em>Agatha fist-pumps internally) she might be thinking the same thing. Fantastic. Let’s get this show on the road, Agatha thinks, what a Christmas gift to herself, honestly-</p><p>She reaches for her glass of wine and spills the entire thing all over herself.</p><p>Rio, the insufferable asshole, snorts.</p><p><em>What </em>is it with her and this woman and embarrassing herself with wine?</p><p>“<em>Fuck.</em>” Agatha springs up, reaching for her napkin to start dabbing at herself. On her other side, Sharon Davis starts to fret about the tablecloth. <em>Baking soda and lemon juice-</em></p><p>“Oh, forget the tablecloth. It’s a piece of shit anyway.” Lilia waves her hand. “Agatha, there’s some stain remover in the laundry room, and you can borrow anything you need from upstairs. Rio will get it for you.”</p><p>“I will?”  Rio raises an eyebrow. She had stood up when Agatha had – either to avoid the wine now spreading across the tablecloth, or, in her wildest dreams, to stay closer to her.</p><p>“Yeah, Rio can help me in the laundry room,” Agatha says, reaching for her hand, and Rio’s eyebrows rocket into her hairline.</p><p>“I- okay.” Delightfully, she lets Agatha pull her away from the table.</p><p>To be fair, she really doesn’t know where the laundry room is, so she lets Rio lead her deeper into the house. The light gets shadowy, Rio’s jawline and the small bump of her nose becoming more pronounced, and Agatha, like a weirdo, feels her mouth water. When Rio elbows open a swinging door and leads Agatha into a cramped laundry room (more like a closet), she has to stop herself from reaching for Rio’s hair and tugging her forward.</p><p>Agatha leans against the washer-dryer combo while Rio searches a cabinet for stain remover. “Take your blazer off,” she commands, and, well, Agatha’s not a bottom by a long shot, but fuck her if she doesn’t shuck it off immediately. The worst of the spill is on her chest, and Rio approaches with a soft rag, dipped in cleaning solution and smelling vaguely like lemons. “Can I?” she asks, and Agatha hates that she’s a little breathless when she nods.</p><p>A woman cleaning wine off of her chest should not be this erotic, but Agatha’s lip is trapped between her teeth, watching how Rio’s brow furrows as she works. The shirt is cold where it presses into her skin. It’s also definitely ruined, no matter how hard Rio dabs at the red stain. Also, Agatha’s not really thinking about her shirt.</p><p>“Why did we start over?” she says, suddenly, before her stupid horny brain can catch up with her stupid horny mouth.</p><p>Rio looks up, hand stilling. “Uh… because I was a total idiot?” She glances down at Agatha’s hands as if to make her point.</p><p>“But we were getting into something… really interesting in the grocery store.” Agatha flutters her eyelashes; she draws a line from Rio’s jaw to her sternum with her unbandaged right hand. It’s a little awkward, because it’s not her dominant (and she’s crowded up against a washer-dryer), but Rio’s pleased little hum doesn’t seem to care. “Don’t you think so?”</p><p>“You shouldn’t do that.” Rio’s voice comes out low and gravely, and <em>fuck, </em>Agatha wants to hear more of that, right now.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because I’ll kiss you.”</p><p>Assertive. Shit. That’s hot. “What’s stopping you, exactly?” Agatha tilts her head, intentionally baring her neck, and Rio honest-to-god groans. The wet cloth falls between them on the floor (right on Agatha’s bare feet, but she’ll think about that later). “Come on, Vidal. Be a big girl.”</p><p>It was a shot in the dark and it pays the <em>fuck </em>off when Rio slides her hands underneath Agatha’s thighs, propping her up against the laundry machine, and leans in until she hovers barely a centimeter from Agatha’s mouth. She can taste her breath, liquor and clam sauce. It makes Agatha feel a little faint.</p><p>“Damn. Landscaper strength.” Rio smirks, but she still just… stands there. “Why aren’t you kissing me?”</p><p>“Enthusiastic consent.”</p><p>“Rio, I don’t know how I could be more enthusiastic right now.” Agatha seizes Rio by the back of the neck and drags their mouths together.</p><p><em>Well, this certainly isn’t how I saw this night going, </em>the rational part of her brain thinks happily as the rest of her is devoured by Rio’s mouth. Her back hurts a bit where it’s pressed into the dryer door and Rio’s nails are digging into the backs of her thighs – actually, Agatha’s not mad about that one. She moans, borderline pornographic, when Rio’s tongue slides sure and soft into her mouth. She gives it a little suck and gets an answering groan in return.</p><p>More of that, please. She slides her right hand around Rio’s neck, trails it down her chest – stopping quickly to give Rio’s a breast a squeeze, which makes a delightful little squeak leave her mouth – and towards the bottom of her dress. It’s a very bad angle. Agatha, thankfully, never backs down from a challenge. “What’s the, like, sound-carrying situation in this house?” she manages to ask, Rio’s hips stuttering at Agatha’s light ministrations over her dress. Is it possible to be in love with someone’s hipbones?</p><p>Rio hums. “You mean can we be loud?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha manages to dig her fingers into Rio’s inner thigh, just under the hem of her dress. One of Rio’s legs shifts to prop Agatha up against the dryer on her knee. <em>Yes yes yes yes, </em>she thinks but doesn’t say in case sound <em>does </em>carry.</p><p>“I don’t think it matters,” Rio says finally. Her lips are so red and swollen. It makes her even prettier.</p><p>“Oh, good.” Agatha drags her hand up Rio’s thigh, but is stopped by fingers curling around her wrist before she can get to what she really wants. (This also means Rio is now holding Agatha up almost entirely with her upper body, every inch of her pressed into every inch of Agatha, which is so… annoyingly hot.)</p><p>“No, I meant-” Rio clears her throat and gasps when Agatha licks her neck. “<em>Stop that. </em>I’m not letting you finger me in my foster mother’s laundry room.”</p><p>“<em>Why.</em>” Sure, maybe she whines. Being petulant is attractive, in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“Because…” Rio drags Agatha’s hand out from under her dress, raises it to her mouth, and, <em>ohfuckyes, </em>sucks on the tip of her middle finger. “It’s Christmas Eve,” she rasps when she lets Agatha’s hand fall away.</p><p>“<em>And?</em>”</p><p>“Well, you’re supposed to be in bed before midnight,” Rio shrugs. “Otherwise Santa won’t come.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio backs away, letting Agatha back down onto her feet gently. “<em>Oh,</em>” she realizes, when Rio reaches for her blazer and helps her into it, the kind of mischief in her eyes that Agatha really, really likes.</p><p>Rio leads her by hand out to the front door, where she, like an absolute gentleman, gets on her knees and helps Agatha into her heels. “We’re going on a walk!” she hollers, and Agatha stifles her snort into the palm of her hand.</p><p>Rio’s lacing up her boots when Lilia flits through the foyer from the kitchen carrying a tray of cookies. “Use protection, dear,” she says offhandedly, and Rio turns red as Rudolph’s nose.</p><p>“Yeah, you better have a condom on you, <em>stud,</em>” Agatha grins, leaning down to press a quick kiss to Rio’s neck. God, she loves how Rio looks when she’s flustered. She loves it even more when she has to buckle her into the passenger seat of her car herself because Rio won’t stop trying to kiss her.</p><p>If Agatha’s learning anything this Christmas, it’s that she needs to spill wine more often.</p>
